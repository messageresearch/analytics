[4:21] thank you thank you Jesus
[4:24] you need a touch from him today saints
[4:26] that channel is still flowing free today
[4:29] we've just reached into it for what we
[4:31] have need of the only way to do it is by
[4:33] faith
[4:34] you just have to believe
[4:36] in faith faith conquers fear
[4:40] fear brings sickness Faith brings belief
[4:43] relief healing amen you know it's it's a
[4:49] part of the inherent in Christian Life
[4:52] everything that we have everything that
[4:54] we do we do by faith believing amen we
[4:58] don't necessarily have any tangible
[5:00] evidence all the tangible evidence
[5:03] people say they have
[5:05] science and medicine proves away
[5:09] but you got to believe it by faith it's
[5:11] got to be something inside the
[5:13] individual that says I know there's an
[5:16] Almighty I know there is a God that made
[5:21] and controls this world this universe
[5:24] these galaxies every molecule every Star
[5:27] every atom he knows it he created it and
[5:30] he controls every bit of it
[5:33] we believe in that God because he is our
[5:35] Lord and savior the condescended in the
[5:38] body of Jesus Christ to become man just
[5:41] like you and me to become a Kinfolk to
[5:44] us to suffer and to go through all the
[5:47] shame
[5:49] pain
[5:50] sickness the hurting you ever realize
[5:54] there is it ever dawned on us at the
[5:57] last moments of our savior's life our
[5:59] God almighty's life was in agony pain
[6:04] he meant that he did that just for us

[20:58] mention to you I appreciate everyone's
[21:01] prayers for me while I was gone uh it
[21:04] was a it was a tough week it's pretty
[21:06] tiring
[21:07] thank you buddy
[21:11] praise the Lord his prayers
[21:15] but the lord always
[21:18] takes care amen and makes a way praise
[21:22] the Lord so
[21:24] thankful the Lord bless us and be able
[21:26] to get back home yesterday morning and
[21:28] go to Emma's birthday party which we
[21:31] were happy to be able to be a part of
[21:33] and thank the Lord I'm not sure I was
[21:35] actually there but just in body
[21:39] I was uh pretty tired but uh thank the
[21:42] Lord to be able to be a part of that and
[21:43] amen appreciate each one of his prayers
[21:46] amen there I have a prayer request uh of
[21:49] course I want to remember brother Dennis
[21:51] and his wife Leah is out of town uh they
[21:54] took visit us he said last week to South
[21:57] Carolina North Carolina over a bit
[21:58] because I believe was for aunt uh there
[22:02] in the upper part of South Carolina just
[22:04] below North Carolina closed like I said
[22:07] to where uh actually where brother Nolan
[22:09] and sister Shirley live
[22:11] so pray for them they'll be back I think
[22:14] the middle of the week this week if I
[22:15] remember right so please remember them
[22:17] in prayer if you would also brother
[22:19] Danny text me and you know we have been
[22:21] praying here for his Noisy Neighbor
[22:23] upstairs to move out and the neighbor
[22:24] upstairs finally moved down
[22:27] now another neighbors moved in he said
[22:30] is louder than the last thinkers so
[22:35] um so yes the Supreme didn't get much
[22:38] sleep last night he woke up with a crick
[22:40] in his neck and kind of in pain so
[22:42] please remember him in prayer if you
[22:44] would today amen for those neighbors and
[22:46] for his landlord I guess to Danny wants
[22:50] to move out so that's I guess probably
[22:53] above every all and everything maybe is
[22:55] the Lord provide another place for him
[22:58] to be able to move to because beyond all
[23:01] the complications that he's endured he
[23:04] really just wants to try to move out of
[23:06] that place into a different better
[23:07] facility so I believe the Lord is more
[23:10] than able to do that amen also remember
[23:13] uh Shariah text me this morning and said
[23:15] that Alice woke up this morning and not
[23:18] feeling well and had a caught a little
[23:19] bit of a cough I think yesterday at the
[23:21] party and uh it apparently has turned
[23:24] into a cold and she has fever so please
[23:26] remember Alice in prayer this morning
[23:28] and of course the family uh if you would
[23:30] that's there with with Alice right and
[23:33] Gabriel So amen also got a request of
[23:37] prayer from um brother Angel fraho so it
[23:41] was a little leaky so I thought I would
[23:43] just read it to you here off the text he
[23:45] sent me he said asking for prayers for
[23:47] our household here asking for healing
[23:50] physically and mostly mentally and
[23:52] spiritually asking that God cleanses
[23:55] everyone's hearts and Minds asking for
[23:57] God to spread his holy love and
[23:59] forgiveness upon us all also asking God
[24:02] to lead us and guide us every day may
[24:04] God draw us closer to him so that we
[24:06] reflect him daily to everyone around us
[24:09] and we ask for God's complete will and
[24:11] blessings in our lives daily we also ask
[24:14] God to do unto our church family as well
[24:17] may God bless you all daily and may all
[24:20] your walk all our walks be closer to our

[30:08] wrote this uh
[30:13] you remember this story I'm just going
[30:15] to read it
[30:16] um it says Pastor do you remember the
[30:18] story of brother green told of the time
[30:21] he was respecting the sanctuary of the
[30:24] Tabernacle uh he was shot from Brother
[30:26] random started shouting across the
[30:27] sanctuary yes I do remember that story
[30:29] uh to ask brother green question about
[30:32] lunch going to eat or something it was
[30:35] about lunch yeah brother Branham was
[30:38] behind that you remember the story
[30:39] behind the pulpit brother green was over
[30:41] there and brother green was I think
[30:43] vacuuming or something he was so uh
[30:46] afraid of church order he didn't want to
[30:49] bump the chair legs with the vacuum with
[30:51] the noise it made and and then all of a
[30:54] sudden he's back there and brother Perry
[30:55] yelled a brother Branham yells out hey
[30:58] and talks to brother green across the
[31:00] pool I saw yes I remember that story
[31:03] uh that that's pretty much the gist of
[31:06] it fairly were you going to eat and all
[31:08] this and
[31:10] so brother brother Green's life
[31:13] he's trying to whisper brother
[31:16] you see he learned a great lesson about
[31:17] church War at that time
[31:20] um
[31:21] let me see if I can continue the story
[31:23] shocked when he continued to whisper
[31:25] even though they were the only two in
[31:27] the church brother Graham continued
[31:29] shouting the conversation across the
[31:31] room yes now people were present and
[31:34] still trying to get something for God
[31:36] I'm quiet if everything is uh leaving
[31:39] together I talk in the sanctuary I was
[31:41] rebuking for talking the sanctuary just
[31:43] a short comment for a person everyone uh
[31:46] was half out already so I believe uh
[31:50] that of course that wasn't here but uh
[31:53] well we try to make sure when when we we
[31:56] do reverence our sanctuary as much as
[31:58] possible but obviously when uh when that
[32:02] situation came up it showed brother
[32:04] green a little bit of lesson that
[32:06] brother Branham had
[32:08] about the reverancing of the sanctuary
[32:10] and and how we conduct ourselves in
[32:13] God's house during service or not during
[32:16] service but there was nothing out of
[32:18] line that brother Brown had done or
[32:20] anything that was displeasing to the
[32:22] Lord and uh but brother green had been
[32:25] taught so much have been and instilled
[32:28] in him by others so much that he was
[32:30] even afraid to bump the chair leg uh
[32:32] with
[32:33] vacuum cleaner but
[32:35] um but brother Branham taught him a
[32:37] valuable lesson there but we do when we
[32:39] leave we try to we have a place to
[32:41] Fellowship so this is not a place of
[32:43] Fellowship except with him we do have a
[32:46] place to fellowship and we have
[32:47] beautiful weather in Tucson to step
[32:50] outside and fellowship so that's what we
[32:52] try to do and make sure uh we keep this
[32:55] place as worshipful as possible amen
[32:57] amen so uh we do know that but thank the
[33:01] Lord for that amen and I do yes I
[33:03] remember the story very vividly
[33:06] um brother brother green told his story
[33:08] it's quite often I guess maybe people
[33:11] would get sick of hearing them but I
[33:12] think he did that a lot of times they
[33:14] helped me remember a lot of the detail
[33:16] of the stories probably just because of
[33:19] that I still remember that so
[33:22] God knows yes praise the Lord let's sing
[33:25] uh song number 698 amen he's God on the
[33:29] mountain

[33:46] glory of the Lord so

[38:44] amen yes he is hallelujah
[38:48] thank Jesus as such an inspirational
[38:51] song Amen I know it was written by our
[38:54] sister McKamey but you know she's not in
[38:57] the message but that is such an
[38:59] inspirational song Amen praise the Lord
[39:02] and it is so true how we lose sight of
[39:05] that so many times and he's God in the
[39:08] valley just as much as he's got in the
[39:10] mountain he's God when you're going
[39:12] through very hard times just like he is
[39:15] God when everything seems to be one
[39:17] perfect he's still gone that doesn't
[39:20] change anything amen praise the Lord
[39:23] Jesus he takes it he makes it all right
[39:26] amen thank you Lord sometimes we can't
[39:30] recognize it sometimes we can't see it
[39:32] sometimes our vision is so short-sighted
[39:35] we don't recognize God's hands upon it
[39:38] but if you have faith to believe you
[39:40] know that he will anything that's not to
[39:44] our betterment amen praise the Lord
[39:47] Jesus amen I love it don't you praise
[39:50] the Lord God bless you amen appreciate
[39:53] the Lord's goodness to us thank you for
[39:55] all the good positive testimonies amen
[39:58] we'll stand to our feet now amen turn to
[40:01] the word of God
[40:12] of his precious word amen
[40:21] amen we're going to turn our Bibles
[40:23] again now to Genesis chapter 1.
[40:27] he goes first a couple of students again
[40:30] as we go into the new the new beginning
[40:32] part nine
[40:36] part nine
[40:39] we're getting there Saints
[40:41] amen we're getting there
[40:43] praise the Lord
[40:46] getting to the park basically pretty
[40:48] much today it's going to be a lot of
[40:52] where we're living and just beyond where
[40:54] we're at now so amen we've gone back
[40:57] from the beginning in Genesis and we of
[40:59] course you read that scripture every
[41:00] time but and gone through time and hit
[41:03] some high points and getting us to this
[41:06] place here kind of where we're at now
[41:08] because remember
[41:09] starting at the beginning we're going to
[41:11] that basically what we consider or know
[41:13] of is to be the end even though it's not
[41:15] an end uh you know what I'm saying in
[41:17] that new city that new beginning praise
[41:20] the Lord so we're kind of about halfway
[41:22] there maybe to that point so amen
[41:25] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[41:27] before we read let's just bow our heads
[41:29] for another word of prayer if we could
[41:30] Lord Jesus we are again grateful Lord of
[41:33] grace and mercy in our lives thankful
[41:35] father for the spirit that we have felt
[41:37] this morning and knowing that you are
[41:39] here God we're just a few in number
[41:41] father but Mighty in power and strength
[41:44] because you are on our side Lord and you
[41:46] are here and you are with us doing the
[41:48] exceedingly abundantly bringing our
[41:51] faith Lord we feeling the moving of that
[41:54] Spirit brings our faith up Lord to a
[41:56] level to receive whatever we have need
[41:58] of today we know that you're still the
[42:01] same God today as you have always been
[42:03] and you're here right now God doing that
[42:06] for each one of us Lord and bringing us
[42:08] to that place that we need to that time
[42:11] God that as we've come and gathered here
[42:13] in your house Lord and that time God
[42:16] that you've given us consecrated
[42:18] Sanctified set aside Lord hear at that
[42:21] time looking to hear from you again Lord
[42:23] from your word speak to us father speak
[42:26] to me Lord speak to us may you anoint
[42:30] speaker and hear our ears our lips all
[42:33] that is said and done today God let it
[42:35] be to glorify magnify and exalt you we
[42:38] thank you Lord for those that have come
[42:40] Lord for those who weren't able to make
[42:42] it today those who may be streaming Lord
[42:44] for every request that was made
[42:45] mentioned Lord everything that was known
[42:47] you knew them before they ever became
[42:48] requests trusting and believing your
[42:51] hand upon each one of them now and now
[42:53] upon us here at this place God expecting
[42:56] you once again to reveal your word to
[42:59] our heart openness to us help us see and
[43:01] hear what you'd have us to see and know
[43:03] God is nothing new nothing outside your
[43:06] scripture nothing outside the message
[43:08] Lord nothing that but just bringing back
[43:11] to remembrance and helping us Lord to
[43:14] energize our faith to bring us along to
[43:16] the place of this time of a Rapture
[43:19] lording and a going home and catching
[43:21] away
[43:22] Lord we can commit ourselves to you and
[43:25] just trust your hand upon us in the
[43:27] remaining part of the service we rebuke
[43:29] every demonic Spirit we try to hurt
[43:31] hinder and filtrate this service in any
[43:33] way that you get the glory and the
[43:35] praise for all that is said and done for
[43:36] the precious holy lovely name of our
[43:38] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask it
[43:41] amen
[43:43] amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 in
[43:46] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[43:49] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[43:50] and void and darkness is upon the face
[43:52] of the deep the spirit of God moved upon
[43:55] the face of the waters you could be
[43:57] seated if you'd like
[43:59] so just talking about how we are at this
[44:02] place now
[44:03] uh through this life through this time
[44:06] uh even brother Noel hit on it a little
[44:09] bit and talking about the wickedness of
[44:12] the world and the evilness of the hour
[44:13] that we live and things that are going
[44:15] on in this world today that 10 years ago
[44:19] I never would have fathomed 20 years ago
[44:21] wasn't even a fault but things that are
[44:24] being said and done today things that
[44:26] are uh anti-science
[44:30] anti-medicine
[44:32] anti-biology
[44:34] anti-god uh is becoming extremely
[44:38] prevalent uh it seems like we're trying
[44:41] to be anyway infiltrating into the minds
[44:44] and hearts of people more probably now
[44:46] than it ever has because we're coming to
[44:49] an end and a winding up because all of
[44:51] this now is coming to a place it's
[44:54] coming to a head amen it's really coming
[44:57] to two heads actually one head is the
[45:00] Bride of Jesus Christ is going to be
[45:01] raptured and go home that's the verse
[45:04] second is going to be a time where the
[45:06] whole world is gathered foolish virgin
[45:08] Jew and all gathered together to that
[45:11] place of of Armageddon amen that's where
[45:14] it's all going you hear so many times
[45:16] even the president United States
[45:18] mentioned and uttered that word a couple
[45:19] of weeks ago about Armageddon when it
[45:22] come to Russia and nuclear possible
[45:24] nuclear weapons and War and things like
[45:27] that even mentioned like the the thought
[45:29] of Armageddon uh so it's it's quite a
[45:32] word that the world is familiar with but
[45:34] probably very few have any understanding
[45:38] of what it is or what it means or what's
[45:39] going to happen amen so but as of where
[45:44] we are at we know that now we are at a
[45:47] time of a Rapture the bride is at the
[45:50] place at the time of the going home how
[45:53] many more days how many more months how
[45:55] many more years we don't know we this
[45:58] might be the day
[45:59] or it might be a hundred years from now
[46:02] right we don't know brother random talks
[46:05] about from six to nine in the morning
[46:06] well six to nine in the morning to who
[46:10] Arizona
[46:12] there's three hours difference at least
[46:14] until next week there's three hours
[46:16] difference between here and the East
[46:17] Coast
[46:18] there's three hours difference between
[46:20] North Carolina and California all the
[46:23] time it's three hours difference so
[46:24] that's the three hour difference between
[46:26] six and nine is it going to be in Russia
[46:28] is it going to be in China is it going
[46:30] to be in Africa where it says six to
[46:33] nine going to be we don't know it could
[46:35] be any time amen I kind of think it's
[46:38] going to be between six and nine East
[46:40] Coast time or the profit of the hours
[46:44] time that was here that that that's my
[46:47] personal opinion that means absolutely
[46:49] nothing that ten dollars will get you a
[46:50] cup of coffee at Starbucks but that's my
[46:53] opinion anyway I think that's because
[46:55] the six nine because I don't believe
[46:56] that brother Brown said anything uh that
[47:00] was out of sort so if the six to nine
[47:02] came up based on the watches of the
[47:04] scripture I believe there's irrelevance
[47:06] to it and based on the fact that he was
[47:09] here from uh that East Coast time frame
[47:13] I tend to believe it's going to be six
[47:15] to nine in the morning East Coast time
[47:17] that's my opinion again that means very
[47:20] little but it's still my opinion uh you
[47:22] can have what you want bottom line is it
[47:24] can be any time it could be at any
[47:26] moment it could be at any day it could
[47:28] still be today we don't know but it
[47:30] could be a hundred years from now we
[47:31] don't know I don't believe it's going to
[47:34] be but 40 years ago I didn't think I'd
[47:36] be here today
[47:37] 50 60 years ago you probably all didn't
[47:40] know just going to be here today how
[47:42] would I ever have guessed that we would
[47:44] have kids or my kids would be in their
[47:46] 30s well sorry Captain almost 30s
[47:50] mind that look uh almost 30. uh and
[47:55] almost three grandchildren I never would
[47:57] have imagined being here could you uh
[48:00] and and having kids and grandchildren
[48:02] and maybe even great-grandchildren I
[48:03] don't know and and where we are today so
[48:06] we don't know but we do know that the
[48:08] Rapture is a ham we do know that we are
[48:10] in the season of the coming of the Lord
[48:12] and it could be at any time but when the
[48:15] Rapture comes the bride will leave this
[48:17] place and she will be caught up to meet
[48:20] the Lord in the air amen the second
[48:23] coming of the lord we will go he is
[48:24] coming there he comes as we go this time
[48:27] he doesn't come to Earth but we meet him
[48:30] in the air and we go to a wedding supper
[48:32] a three and a half year period of a
[48:35] wedding supper of the Lamb that's where
[48:37] the bride goes to the supper during the
[48:40] three and a half years of tribulation
[48:42] now
[48:43] I left out uh
[48:46] a lot of the teaching of Daniel 70 weeks
[48:49] in this study uh just for the mere fact
[48:52] that that would have taken up so much
[48:55] more of this and I just wanted to mainly
[48:58] hit the high points along to get us from
[49:01] beginning to end uh through those
[49:04] through those more significant periods
[49:06] and high points and where we're living
[49:09] today so uh to understand the last three
[49:13] and a half years of Daniel 70 weeks we
[49:16] understand that Jesus when he was here
[49:18] fulfilled the first three and a half
[49:20] years and he was killed and cut off as
[49:24] the scripture says in the midst in the
[49:27] middle of that three and uh seven years
[49:29] that first three and a half years of his
[49:31] ministry from 30 to 33 and a half cut
[49:35] off in the midst the last three and a
[49:36] half is to come after the bride is gone
[49:39] the last three and a half years of that
[49:43] ministry will be fulfilled in the
[49:45] tribulation and as God goes back to the
[49:47] Jews and be and and be ministered
[49:50] through Moses and Elijah in uh in
[49:54] Revelation 11 because at that time the
[49:57] anointing will have gone back to the
[49:58] Jews which we've talked about a couple
[50:00] of times we'll be there for them for
[50:02] Revelation 11. uh I've had people say
[50:06] was is it going to be literally Moses
[50:08] and literally Elijah I've had people say
[50:10] it won't be literally it'll just be the
[50:12] spirit of again you I haven't found
[50:16] where brother Branham said specifically
[50:18] uh if you do know let me know uh that
[50:21] it's going to be the literal Moses and
[50:24] the literal Elijah uh I don't know I
[50:27] don't I personally don't think it will
[50:29] be the literal Moses and Elijah I
[50:31] believe it'll be the spirit of those men
[50:33] that will be in men that are probably
[50:36] again my opinion probably on earth now
[50:42] because if they're literal men they
[50:44] would have to be born and they would
[50:46] have to grow up and there would have to
[50:48] be people the men that were there uh in
[50:52] the land at the time who received the
[50:54] spirit I just like brother Branham of
[50:57] course uh here for the Gentiles uh
[51:00] brother Adam was a man he was he was
[51:01] born he was raised the Lord began to
[51:04] deal with him and the spirit of Elijah
[51:06] came on it right and began to do the
[51:07] works and had the spirit of Elijah in
[51:10] the scripture I I personally believe
[51:12] it's going to be a lot the same way in
[51:14] Revelation 11 with those two and uh in
[51:17] Israel there as they grow up and receive
[51:19] the spirit of of Moses and one of Elijah
[51:23] you can go back and read the the the
[51:26] demonstrations that they have basically
[51:29] tell of who they are uh one has the
[51:32] power to shut up Heaven that it rained
[51:34] not days in the prophecy well that's
[51:36] that's pretty evident that's Elijah
[51:39] Elijah went to Ahab and did the exact
[51:41] same thing there'll be no do and no rain
[51:43] drop fall from Heaven until I call for
[51:46] it that's what Elijah told e Ahab and
[51:49] that's exactly what happened
[51:51] he shut up the Heavens amen and it
[51:53] didn't rain until he called for it amen
[51:56] and the second was these have the power
[51:59] to shut up heaven and power over the
[52:02] waters to turn them to blood and dismite
[52:05] the Earth with plays that everybody
[52:09] knows the the story of Moses in the land
[52:11] of Goshen in Egypt exactly what took
[52:14] place in the water turning the blood and
[52:15] all the plagues so it's not hard to
[52:17] understand that those two are going to
[52:19] be and distribute or manifest the spirit
[52:22] of Moses and Elijah to to those people
[52:26] at that time so that three and a half
[52:29] years is going to be that period and
[52:31] during that period of time is where they
[52:33] begin to realize and receive by
[52:36] Revelation who Jesus Christ was and at
[52:40] the end and we've already talked about
[52:41] this we know and I read that quote at
[52:44] the end of that marriage supper
[52:47] and at the end of the tribulation period
[52:50] Jesus Will slip away from the Gentile
[52:53] bride and reveal himself to his brother
[52:55] just like Joseph did Joseph dismissed
[52:59] his Gentiles the the Gentile bride the
[53:02] marriage supper will be dismissed to the
[53:04] uh to the kingdom and Jesus Will slip
[53:07] down and reveal himself to his brothers
[53:09] and they realize who they did now this
[53:12] is at the end of that period of time the
[53:15] end of that three and a half years the
[53:17] end of that tribulation but there's also
[53:20] the great thing that's going to take
[53:22] place at the end of that time is is
[53:24] during that tribulation and we know the
[53:26] tribulation the tribulation is not for
[53:29] the brine because remember the
[53:31] tribulation is a purification period
[53:33] it's a time of purging and the bride
[53:37] does not need any purification she does
[53:40] not need any purifying uh just his
[53:43] brother Patty prayed to us and prayed
[53:46] this morning and and talked about how
[53:49] the bride is she's pure now Justified as
[53:53] if though she had never done it in the
[53:55] first place robed in his righteousness
[53:58] without a spot wrinkle or blemish well
[54:01] if she is without spot wrinkle or
[54:02] blemish what purpose of what need would
[54:05] there be for the bride to go through the
[54:08] tribulation purging period
[54:10] she's already been Purge she's already
[54:12] been found innocent she's already been
[54:15] found Guiltless she's married to the
[54:18] righteous Son of God Jesus Christ and
[54:20] she's going to a married supper of the
[54:23] Lamb amen the marriage supper comes
[54:27] after the after the ceremony
[54:31] so where does the ceremony of the
[54:33] marriage take place
[54:35] it's not there it's got to be here
[54:38] Christ is marrying his bride right here
[54:41] right now amen she's slit he is slipped
[54:45] on the wedding band of unmerited Grace
[54:48] to his bride and she's received the
[54:51] spirit of him now so that when we leave
[54:55] here we go to the reception we go to the
[54:58] supper praise the Lord so if she is
[55:00] married to him now become white then
[55:04] what point is there for her to go
[55:06] through that purging period She doesn't
[55:08] need any purging she's pure already amen
[55:12] she's perfect undefiled wedding the
[55:15] wearing the wedding Garment of of
[55:18] unmerited Grace
[55:21] the the bride making herself ready with
[55:26] the with with the
[55:29] bridegroom's garment the word
[55:33] he took our place so that we could take
[55:37] his right and he is perfect without spot
[55:40] wrinkle or blemish his bride is perfect
[55:44] without spot wrinkle or blemish not you
[55:47] as a human but the word the of Christ
[55:51] coming in you has made you perfect has
[55:54] purged you of all unrighteousness
[55:57] Justified you because you never did it
[56:01] in the first place
[56:02] praise God just cause you got tricked
[56:05] into something on your flesh or say
[56:07] something or a little emotion or anger
[56:10] or something come up the emotion and the
[56:12] spirit of a human or something and those
[56:14] things happen to all of us hopefully
[56:16] less and less as we live our lives amen
[56:19] as we grow more like Jesus Christ those
[56:21] things happen less and less than our
[56:23] life amen amen until we get to the point
[56:25] that that that it won't be perfect but
[56:28] in a body change it'll be perfect
[56:30] amen so why would the bride need to go
[56:33] through purification she doesn't
[56:35] tribulation is purification tribulation
[56:38] will be for the foolish virgin and the
[56:42] 144 000 for the Jews and those that did
[56:45] not receive it now they will be purged
[56:48] during that period of time the rest will
[56:50] be done away with it amen through this
[56:53] battle through this time of tribulation
[56:55] now we see everything Gathering itself
[56:58] together
[57:00] we've already got to that place of of
[57:04] pretty much the governments of the world
[57:07] crying and yelling to become one one
[57:10] world
[57:12] let's all become one world well you see
[57:16] what happens in this country when we are
[57:19] dependent on other countries and one
[57:21] country decides to invade Another
[57:23] Country what happens to us
[57:27] we tend to suffer a little bit as a
[57:29] result we shouldn't have to because I
[57:31] believe personally we are a country of
[57:33] self-sufficiency we should be able to uh
[57:36] fend for ourselves but we've become so
[57:39] dependent on things from other countries
[57:40] Well when things go wrong in that
[57:42] country that we can't control it affects
[57:45] us but you see the whole world it's
[57:47] becoming this one world we want a United
[57:50] Nations used to be the League of Nations
[57:52] the United Nations now all come together
[57:54] we're one world we're one people we're
[57:57] all together it's the exact same life
[57:59] Satan tried to tell the the the the the
[58:02] Jews Israel back in the day with uh with
[58:06] with Balaam he told them the exact same
[58:09] thing well we're all one we're all one
[58:11] people let's just all come together
[58:13] let's just have those that are ungodly
[58:16] marry him with the children of God it
[58:17] doesn't work that way we are not one
[58:20] we are not all together we are not a
[58:24] United group now the world order is
[58:28] the Council of churches is
[58:31] and the bride is
[58:32] but she's not United with them
[58:35] and they hate you for it that's why
[58:38] they're trying to squeeze the Christian
[58:39] out now they just call it Christian
[58:42] because they don't know that there's a
[58:44] segment of that Christianity of that
[58:46] Christian Dome that is a pure undefiled
[58:50] bride of Jesus Christ they kind of want
[58:52] you all together if you're a Christian
[58:54] you're just a Christian
[58:55] well let me tell you friend they're not
[58:58] all the same just like not all Israel
[59:01] according to the scripture not all says
[59:03] they're Israel's Israel not all that
[59:05] says they're a Christian not all that
[59:06] says their bride is bride amen but this
[59:10] world is coming together
[59:12] it's giving his head coming to that
[59:14] place of headship to where it it it ends
[59:18] up and winds up at that place at the end
[59:21] of the tribulation
[59:22] that winds up the tribulation uh uh to
[59:26] Armageddon let me read you a couple of
[59:29] things here
[59:31] remember it winds up at Armageddon now
[59:34] brother said in the patriarch Abraham
[59:37] Bakersfield California he said that's
[59:39] that's all we care to know God promised
[59:42] it how is it going to be I can't tell
[59:44] you but God said so amen we just have
[59:47] faith he'll send Jesus Christ the second
[59:50] time
[59:51] he will come in a physical form brother
[59:53] Branham said in in the Rapture even
[59:57] though we're going in the air to meet
[59:58] him Amen in a physical form he will
[1:00:02] claim his own
[1:00:04] there will be 1 000 years Millennium
[1:00:07] Reign upon this Earth with him with the
[1:00:11] redeemed
[1:00:12] now I want to put something before you
[1:00:16] and I hope
[1:00:18] people don't take this wrong
[1:00:21] but we know that in the second coming of
[1:00:25] the Bride of this last day and the end
[1:00:27] times Jesus Christ will not set his feet
[1:00:31] in a Corporal body upon this Earth
[1:00:34] we know that amen amen so what is he
[1:00:38] doing instead what has he done
[1:00:42] and doing instead
[1:00:46] whose feet have set upon this planet
[1:00:53] the first fruits of that
[1:00:56] God coming in demonstration
[1:00:59] to show to this bride now the man was
[1:01:02] not God
[1:01:04] but he produced God so closely that
[1:01:07] people thought he was God yeah amen
[1:01:11] just like Abraham just like when he
[1:01:14] turned his back and got and could
[1:01:16] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:01:18] heart God doing it through a man
[1:01:21] putting his feet upon this Earth
[1:01:23] with the bride because now brother Pat
[1:01:26] said the bride absolutely right he's a
[1:01:28] part of the problem
[1:01:30] we're all right
[1:01:32] now how does God
[1:01:35] how has God returned to this earth in
[1:01:39] its fullness
[1:01:40] in this last day when he is not going to
[1:01:43] do it
[1:01:44] in the rapture
[1:01:47] he's done it through us
[1:01:49] he did it in a first fruit if you will
[1:01:52] through a prophet through brother
[1:01:54] Branham who again lived a life so close
[1:01:57] to God people thought he was God people
[1:01:59] today still say he was God
[1:02:01] still worship and believe that he was
[1:02:03] still baptized in his name even to this
[1:02:05] day
[1:02:07] that's how close it was
[1:02:10] amen now in in that and the opening and
[1:02:14] revealing of the word this bride
[1:02:16] becoming this word through the
[1:02:19] revelation of that word remember
[1:02:20] Revelation the best way I could explain
[1:02:23] it Revelation is something that becomes
[1:02:25] a part of you
[1:02:26] it is much a part of you as your as your
[1:02:30] uh the Flesh of your skin and your bone
[1:02:34] and and your thought and your heart and
[1:02:36] everything about you it just becomes a
[1:02:38] part of it a revelation is something
[1:02:40] that when God gives it to you you cannot
[1:02:43] deny you can never see it a different
[1:02:46] way uh I give the example if you
[1:02:49] remember it's been years ago so I'll do
[1:02:51] it again you give the example I'll give
[1:02:53] the example of that sign it's something
[1:02:55] the lord gave me one day uh that uh sign
[1:02:59] that people used to make that had Jesus
[1:03:01] written on it like a wooden sign
[1:03:03] but the outside Parts was what was
[1:03:06] accentuated so when you looked at it
[1:03:08] with I guess you'd say an untrained eye
[1:03:11] you look at it all you see is just a
[1:03:13] bunch of scribble it looks like you know
[1:03:15] what I'm talking about yeah
[1:03:17] because the inside is all accentuated
[1:03:21] but then
[1:03:22] people say well what does that say he
[1:03:25] said it doesn't say anything all I see
[1:03:27] is some lines here and some lines here
[1:03:29] and this going over here and it doesn't
[1:03:30] make any sense to me what what do you
[1:03:32] got that in your living room for look at
[1:03:34] it again
[1:03:35] you got to look at it real close
[1:03:37] and look at it real hard
[1:03:39] somebody may even have to tell you what
[1:03:41] it says but when you see the inside
[1:03:44] between the lines and you see the inside
[1:03:47] between the existing the accentuated
[1:03:50] parts and you see it says j-e-s-u-s
[1:03:54] you say oh it says Jesus I see it now
[1:03:57] amen you ever done that with a word
[1:04:00] it's God ever done that to you with the
[1:04:02] scripture oh I see it now yeah well when
[1:04:05] you see it you can't unsee it right now
[1:04:08] every single time I'll look at one of
[1:04:10] those post one of those pieces of wood I
[1:04:13] don't see the in the scribble all I see
[1:04:15] is Jesus I can't see it any other way
[1:04:18] anymore because God my eyes had been
[1:04:20] open I see it that's a revelation amen
[1:04:24] when God reveals it to you like that you
[1:04:26] don't see it any other way you don't see
[1:04:28] the denominational way you don't see it
[1:04:31] some uh uh a seminary way you see it the
[1:04:35] way God revealed it to you amen and then
[1:04:39] when you see it that way you can't unsee
[1:04:40] it
[1:04:41] and when you see it that way that's all
[1:04:43] you see you don't see the little
[1:04:46] scribblies anymore they're not even
[1:04:47] there I mean if you really tried hard
[1:04:50] but when you look at it every time I see
[1:04:52] one of those now I look at it all I see
[1:04:54] is Jesus
[1:04:55] right no matter where it is who's got it
[1:04:57] or if you don't see them very much
[1:04:59] anymore that's all I see is Jesus now
[1:05:02] because it was revealed to me
[1:05:04] when God reveals something to you that's
[1:05:06] the way it comes to you that's the way
[1:05:07] it is it becomes part of you you can't
[1:05:10] see it
[1:05:12] and when God reveals it like that you
[1:05:14] become a part of it it becomes a part of
[1:05:16] you well when the Lord when he ripped
[1:05:20] the uh the cover of the scripture and
[1:05:23] and and a man that God coming in man
[1:05:26] forming this last day that God could use
[1:05:29] to bring that word to a bride and that
[1:05:32] revelation of that word come out of
[1:05:34] there to each individual that would
[1:05:36] receive it it becomes a part of you the
[1:05:39] word becomes a part of you just as much
[1:05:42] as the Holy Spirit are you born again
[1:05:43] you have the Holy Ghost well that is
[1:05:46] just as much a part of you as that as
[1:05:48] that spirit is
[1:05:50] and that word comes in it makes it live
[1:05:53] with God is living in you if God is
[1:05:56] growing in you if God is becoming more
[1:05:58] manifest in your life less of me more of
[1:06:01] him my brother Noah was saying last week
[1:06:03] blessed me more of him you become that
[1:06:07] word
[1:06:08] well that's the only way God's gonna
[1:06:10] marry you is if you're the word because
[1:06:12] he's the word
[1:06:14] and the word's not going to marry a
[1:06:16] reprobate the word's going to marry the
[1:06:17] word
[1:06:19] that's why the bride has become the
[1:06:21] worst she has become him one with him
[1:06:24] praise the Lord for together as husband
[1:06:28] and wife together with him praise the
[1:06:31] Lord
[1:06:32] one entity
[1:06:34] Jesus come the second time you come into
[1:06:36] physical form claim his own they'll be
[1:06:39] about a thousand years Millennium Reign
[1:06:41] upon the Earth with him with the
[1:06:44] redeemed now that's the Millennium
[1:06:46] reigned upon the Earth with the Lord now
[1:06:50] the second invisible Union
[1:06:52] he said but we are enthused about it and
[1:06:55] we know that history is closing out the
[1:06:58] world's history will soon be over then
[1:07:01] when now that was 1965.
[1:07:04] so if it was if he said the world's
[1:07:07] history is closing out the world will
[1:07:09] soon be over
[1:07:11] 50 almost 57 years ago where are we now
[1:07:15] amen I'm not that good at math it's like
[1:07:18] I told you I was born
[1:07:20] 20 days after this was said so it's easy
[1:07:24] math for me because I as long as I
[1:07:25] remember how old I am uh I can remember
[1:07:27] that so almost 57 years now how much
[1:07:31] closer are we now than we were then
[1:07:35] we're going to step into a new day
[1:07:38] to the great Millennium that as one
[1:07:41] believer I believe in the Millennium a
[1:07:43] millennium reign with Christ A Thousand
[1:07:45] Years upon the Earth the physical Return
[1:07:47] of the Lord Jesus to take a physical
[1:07:49] body glorified by his cleansing blood
[1:07:52] amen that's word this bride is going
[1:07:56] after the wedding suffered now if we get
[1:07:59] to the Earth let's get to the time here
[1:08:02] that that that we're living here upon
[1:08:05] this Earth because after again after the
[1:08:07] end of the tribulation at the end there
[1:08:10] will be that battle of Armageddon and we
[1:08:12] know that's scripture so let's go read
[1:08:14] that if we could Revelation chapter 16.
[1:08:23] Revelation chapter 16.
[1:08:33] amen even the two witnesses of
[1:08:37] Revelation 11 are killed
[1:08:40] their bodies lay in the street for three
[1:08:42] days
[1:08:43] people coming by making fun talking
[1:08:45] laughing amen but on that third day
[1:08:48] those two dead bodies in the middle of
[1:08:50] the street who raise up and brought to
[1:08:52] life and go in Rapture remember that's
[1:08:54] our our last Rapture the third Rapture
[1:08:57] of this New Testament is those two
[1:08:59] witnesses
[1:09:01] they raise up from the dead of a Rapture
[1:09:03] right in front of everybody
[1:09:05] but it's like brother van said even the
[1:09:08] scripture says though they do a miracle
[1:09:10] before your eyes you won't believe
[1:09:13] if you do the point of it is there's
[1:09:16] nothing there too to believe
[1:09:18] if there's nothing in you to believe if
[1:09:21] you've if you've turned your back from
[1:09:23] it and you you declare you don't believe
[1:09:25] and if you're an unbeliever there's
[1:09:28] nothing in you to see it there's nothing
[1:09:30] in you to believe though one raised from
[1:09:32] the dead
[1:09:33] amen they still don't believe it but
[1:09:36] look Revelation 16 and I want to spend
[1:09:39] the rest of my time just here on this
[1:09:41] Armageddon I thought I'd have time to
[1:09:43] maybe get into the Millennium that's why
[1:09:45] I read those two quotes but time gets by
[1:09:47] fast so we'll just we'll we'll start
[1:09:50] getting into this Armageddon now and the
[1:09:52] sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the
[1:09:56] great river Euphrates
[1:09:58] and the water thereof was dried up that
[1:10:00] the way of the kings of the East might
[1:10:02] be prepared
[1:10:04] and I saw three unclean spirits like
[1:10:07] frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:10:09] dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast
[1:10:12] so it starts with the Devil
[1:10:15] comes out of the mouth of the Dragon
[1:10:16] Satan comes out of the mouth of the
[1:10:19] Beast we know as the office of the Pope
[1:10:21] and out of the mouth of the false
[1:10:24] prophet which I don't know that false
[1:10:26] prophet of that false prophet of that
[1:10:29] mouth those three unclean spirits
[1:10:32] all those unclean spirits notice now are
[1:10:36] coming out of their mouths
[1:10:39] those three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:10:42] these devils and men like frogs come out
[1:10:45] of their mouths three of them
[1:10:48] and they are the spirits of devils amen
[1:10:52] working miracles working miracles how do
[1:10:56] they work miracles they do it within
[1:10:58] because Satan knows remember Satan was
[1:11:00] Lucifer
[1:11:01] Lucifer worked within the confines of
[1:11:04] the spirit that God has that the economy
[1:11:06] that God has placed us in and we know
[1:11:09] that the spirit of God is around the
[1:11:12] world
[1:11:13] the spirit of God moves anybody that's
[1:11:16] able to tap into it
[1:11:18] can operate in no matter who they are
[1:11:21] Devils demons
[1:11:23] you know brother Graham talked about it
[1:11:26] going over and seeing which doctor speak
[1:11:27] in tongues
[1:11:30] stick a sword through them and not bleed
[1:11:31] a drop pull it out look through not even
[1:11:33] believe
[1:11:34] see a pencil stand up by itself and
[1:11:37] write in an unknown tone well how does
[1:11:39] that happen working those Miracles
[1:11:42] hasn't happened they found a way to tap
[1:11:45] in through the inspiration of Lucifer
[1:11:47] who brother Brown said was God's right
[1:11:49] hand man at one time amen angel of Light
[1:11:53] to to tap into what he knew God had
[1:11:57] created in the in the economy of God
[1:12:00] that anointing is there for anybody
[1:12:03] anybody can tap into that anointing if
[1:12:05] they just will believe it
[1:12:07] anybody can how do you think an atheist
[1:12:10] gets healed
[1:12:11] they didn't pray to God to ask him to
[1:12:13] heal them amen medicine didn't heal them
[1:12:16] because God's the Healer
[1:12:18] God's the only one that can heal well
[1:12:20] how'd they get healed
[1:12:22] well have you have to tap into that
[1:12:24] that's kind of a low level of it but you
[1:12:26] have to tap into that's economy God's
[1:12:29] put us in this world today anybody Taps
[1:12:32] into that can be the beneficiary of that
[1:12:34] of that spirit and they all have been
[1:12:38] today they are here working miracles
[1:12:41] well if you don't have a revelation
[1:12:43] those things will deceive you if you
[1:12:46] don't have the Holy Ghost in a
[1:12:48] revelation of the word of the hour those
[1:12:50] things will deceive you and it deceives
[1:12:52] the greater portion of the world who
[1:12:55] look upon that and say oh wow that's
[1:12:57] fantastic but then where are their lives
[1:13:00] you say well they they perform miracles
[1:13:05] but if if the if the Miracles are coming
[1:13:08] out of the devil what good is it is that
[1:13:11] God
[1:13:13] if they've tapped into even operating in
[1:13:16] the gifts of spirit
[1:13:18] what good is it if God's Not There
[1:13:21] or do they believe the word do they live
[1:13:23] the word are they are are they uh born
[1:13:28] again
[1:13:30] check their lives
[1:13:32] see if they be of God
[1:13:35] if that if they live and are just
[1:13:39] basically as ungodly as the rest of the
[1:13:41] world
[1:13:42] it don't matter what gift they tapped
[1:13:45] into that's of the devil
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:49] it's something because it's not
[1:13:50] operating in the in the inspiration of
[1:13:53] the of the perfect will of God
[1:13:56] God operates within his perfect will
[1:13:59] through his children to produce what he
[1:14:02] wants not what I want
[1:14:05] but man and Satan operates in that same
[1:14:09] capacity to work through people to bring
[1:14:12] about his devilish ends
[1:14:15] to deceive people and these working of
[1:14:19] Miracles is a deception to the world
[1:14:23] it looks just like the genuine
[1:14:26] but it's not
[1:14:28] they can perform a miracle but the
[1:14:30] minute they deny the word
[1:14:33] they're not of God Amen
[1:14:36] The Witch of Endor was able to call up
[1:14:38] Samuel yes
[1:14:41] but was that a work of God
[1:14:44] oh that was a miracle but it wasn't a
[1:14:47] work of God
[1:14:48] he even came out and said why in the
[1:14:50] world are you disturbing my rest
[1:14:53] that wasn't a work of God
[1:14:55] his demonic Powers working in that same
[1:14:58] capacity but to their own ends
[1:15:01] what God does is he works it to the end
[1:15:03] to his End Amen and his end is for our
[1:15:06] good
[1:15:08] praise the Lord so we that so that's
[1:15:11] what we want
[1:15:13] that's why we know
[1:15:16] that when God worked through that
[1:15:18] Vindicated prophet
[1:15:20] that when
[1:15:23] all the Miracles all the discernments
[1:15:25] all those things perfect right on the
[1:15:27] money absolutely but the thing that
[1:15:29] solidifies it to the bride it's not the
[1:15:31] Miracles it's not the discernment it's
[1:15:34] not the calling people out it's not the
[1:15:36] uh the the seeing the demons it's not
[1:15:39] telling them where their address was it
[1:15:41] was the word
[1:15:43] the purity of the righteousness and the
[1:15:46] truth of the revealed word of the hours

[1:19:42] the Satan the dragon gathers them all
[1:19:45] together in a place called the Hebrew
[1:19:47] tongue Armageddon God is gathering his
[1:19:50] children together but it's not
[1:19:52] Armageddon
[1:19:53] he's Gathering his children together
[1:19:55] under Jesus Christ amen amen to soon go
[1:19:59] home but Satan the dragon is gathering
[1:20:02] his together that is called to this
[1:20:05] place called Armageddon
[1:20:07] amen now in this that God has uh this
[1:20:13] great battle now remember where did this
[1:20:17] battle start
[1:20:19] this battle did not start
[1:20:22] in Israel this battle did not start in
[1:20:26] Tucson
[1:20:26] this battle did not start frankly
[1:20:29] anywhere on this planet
[1:20:32] this battle started in heaven
[1:20:35] you believe that go read Revelation 12.
[1:20:38] it'll tell you where this battle started
[1:20:41] or this great Dragon drew a third of the
[1:20:45] angels of the stars of heaven with his
[1:20:47] tail
[1:20:48] with his lies and Drew them down and
[1:20:50] they were all cast on the Earth
[1:20:52] and now for how many years Gathering
[1:20:55] them all together to bring them to this
[1:20:57] place of Armageddon at one point God
[1:20:59] wiped them all off the Earth
[1:21:01] but now he brought now they've all come
[1:21:04] back together sin unbelief through the
[1:21:06] through Noah's Ark we all know that that
[1:21:10] ombudi came through the arm and from
[1:21:11] that time what Gathering them all
[1:21:13] together is bringing them all together
[1:21:15] Satan all his children all his followers
[1:21:18] and Believers to this place this battle
[1:21:20] the battle now to wind it up it started
[1:21:24] in heaven
[1:21:25] but now it's about to get finished
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:30] I remember when I was a kid probably a
[1:21:32] crude saved but it used to be when I was
[1:21:35] a kid in high school the the saying was
[1:21:38] uh when there was a something going on a
[1:21:42] disagreement or something or get married
[1:21:44] to fight you say well he started it but
[1:21:46] I'm about to finish it
[1:21:48] probably never heard that amen he
[1:21:52] started it but I'm about to finish it
[1:21:54] Satan started it but God's about to
[1:21:56] finish yeah amen he's Gathering them all
[1:21:59] there to Armageddon and he's bringing
[1:22:01] them all together now let me read you uh
[1:22:03] let me read you something that
[1:22:04] Armageddon now if you look it up you see
[1:22:07] the definition that Armageddon is the
[1:22:09] hill or city of megiddo which is just
[1:22:13] really if you look on a map uh is is
[1:22:16] almost perfectly due north from
[1:22:19] Jerusalem
[1:22:20] it's in Israel it's in the land of
[1:22:22] Israel mogito's in the land of Israel
[1:22:24] again all these major things
[1:22:26] the city we're talking about a word
[1:22:28] Abraham met Melchizedek God sent Abraham
[1:22:32] out to go find this land to inhabit this
[1:22:34] land all this is in that exact same spot
[1:22:38] exact same spot this is the exact same
[1:22:40] spot Armageddon that land that place
[1:22:44] there the land of megiddo Armageddon the
[1:22:47] hill or city of megiddo now
[1:22:51] let me reach you
[1:22:52] hear a couple things I've got now
[1:22:54] brother Brandon said thy house this is
[1:22:57] 1961. he said now the Bible predicts
[1:22:59] that in the last days there will be a a
[1:23:03] trap because I want to talk about those
[1:23:04] three unclean spirits for a little bit
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:08] those three unclean spirits now the
[1:23:11] Bible predicts in the last days that he
[1:23:14] will trap Catholicism romanism and all
[1:23:17] these things them cannot uh communism
[1:23:20] and all them together in the valley of
[1:23:23] megiddo there you were just talking
[1:23:24] about it again trap them bring them all
[1:23:27] together until there will be such a
[1:23:30] Slaughter amongst them until the blood
[1:23:34] will flow to the horse's bit Bridal
[1:23:39] and we know that will be a purging time
[1:23:41] for even the foolish virgin will be
[1:23:43] purged they'll have to sacrifice their
[1:23:45] lives for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:23:48] amen they seal their testimony with
[1:23:51] their own blood
[1:23:53] we steal our testimony with his blood
[1:23:56] they have to seal their testimony with
[1:23:58] their own blood
[1:23:59] in in the tribulation
[1:24:02] such a great Slaughter there that it'll
[1:24:05] be to the blood the blood will flow to
[1:24:08] the horse's bridle in Revelation we know
[1:24:10] that but thanks be to the heavenly
[1:24:11] father we will not be here by his grace
[1:24:14] we won't we'll be in glory see that will
[1:24:18] be right after the two prophets is
[1:24:20] prophesied in the battle of Armageddon
[1:24:23] and he's talking about Revelation 11.
[1:24:25] that's when these Gentile Nations uh get
[1:24:28] so wicked just keep on Confederation of
[1:24:31] churches all this comes together
[1:24:33] um we'll take the church the elect
[1:24:35] Church home the bride out of everyone
[1:24:38] and all the Sleeping virgin will remain
[1:24:41] will still be here
[1:24:44] amen that come out of Revelations come
[1:24:47] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[1:24:49] the dragon and the Beast as we know now
[1:24:52] we're going to get to that in our study
[1:24:54] now these three unclean spirits
[1:24:57] which we probably already know again I'm
[1:25:00] not
[1:25:01] I'm not bringing you anything new we're
[1:25:03] just getting to that place of the new
[1:25:05] beginning scene uh the three unclean
[1:25:07] spirits is that is those three isms
[1:25:11] let me type that out for you now he said
[1:25:13] where it started where it begun see
[1:25:15] there was communism Fascism and Nazism
[1:25:20] they were the spirits that's the three
[1:25:22] spirits that came out of their's mouths
[1:25:24] came out of their mouths as unclean
[1:25:28] frogs
[1:25:29] spirits of devils amen that's the three
[1:25:33] Spirits communism Fascism and Nazism
[1:25:37] they were Spirits communism is a spirit
[1:25:40] of course brother Brandon hid a lot on
[1:25:42] communism because in the 60s communism
[1:25:45] was a a big thing in this country
[1:25:47] everybody fought tooth and nail to try
[1:25:50] to get away from it that seems like a
[1:25:52] lot of people are fighting tooth and
[1:25:53] they'll giving their lives for us to try
[1:25:54] to go back into it amen
[1:25:56] but we know that's where it's all going
[1:25:59] to end up anyway
[1:26:00] but it's but it actually it all ends up
[1:26:02] in Catholicism that's where it all acts
[1:26:04] ends up
[1:26:05] now communism we know is is a a power
[1:26:10] grab it's it's a controlling it's the
[1:26:14] thought that uh and and I guess if you
[1:26:17] look at it in a certain way that it it
[1:26:21] is it is sort of um utopian to think
[1:26:24] communism doesn't work as the government
[1:26:26] never has
[1:26:28] uh even the Soviet Union collapse but
[1:26:31] it's the thought of probably utopianism
[1:26:33] to bring everybody up to exactly the
[1:26:37] same place
[1:26:38] they call it equity
[1:26:41] um the problem is in Satan's Eden is
[1:26:45] that those people that have worked to
[1:26:46] achieve who have actually worked harder
[1:26:49] to achieve more have to come down for to
[1:26:53] meet the people that just hadn't worked
[1:26:55] and don't care
[1:26:56] and made me lazy I don't know
[1:26:59] to try to find some equality the whole
[1:27:02] point of Communism though it's a
[1:27:04] nationality thing is that there's a
[1:27:07] headship or a government or a entity
[1:27:10] that controls all of it
[1:27:13] that tells everybody this is what it's
[1:27:16] going to be this is what we have to do
[1:27:18] to make you come down to here and this
[1:27:21] person come up here so that you're all
[1:27:24] on the same plane oh it sounds wonderful
[1:27:26] sounds like Utopia it'll be that way
[1:27:28] when we get on the other side and uh all
[1:27:31] of God's children in God's mind because
[1:27:33] God has no respecter or person in God's
[1:27:36] mind
[1:27:37] straight across everybody everybody's
[1:27:40] saying nobody's different nobody's
[1:27:41] higher lower nobody has more money less
[1:27:43] money nobody has more cars more houses
[1:27:44] amen it's just all the same but in in in
[1:27:47] Satan's Eden it does not work because
[1:27:50] you have to have those people that are
[1:27:55] harder working probably even smarter to
[1:27:59] to create things to help people that
[1:28:02] maybe aren't quite as diligent as
[1:28:05] working hard or as smart
[1:28:09] for whatever reason
[1:28:11] and but again there's a theme to it
[1:28:14] that that there's the control that's the
[1:28:19] whole thing the equality is one thing
[1:28:21] it's the control who's going to be the
[1:28:24] control
[1:28:25] to say this is the way it's going to be
[1:28:28] yeah
[1:28:29] this is how this has got to be to have
[1:28:32] you and to have you and to bring
[1:28:34] everything
[1:28:36] to take control over it all not with the
[1:28:40] heart of the people
[1:28:42] that that's the big problem they don't
[1:28:44] have the heart of the people
[1:28:46] they have the heart of their own purpose
[1:28:49] amen and their own prosperity and heart
[1:28:52] not of the people
[1:28:54] so when they talk about equality they
[1:28:56] don't care really what happens to the
[1:28:58] people they just want it to sound good
[1:29:00] look good so that they stay in power
[1:29:04] that's communism in a nutshell now
[1:29:07] Fascism and Nazism are basically the
[1:29:09] same because Nazism is really just a
[1:29:12] form of of fascism which basically just
[1:29:15] is just a dictator controlling everybody
[1:29:19] and calm the shots and saying this and
[1:29:21] and and
[1:29:24] the similarities there now are the fact
[1:29:27] of what communism does and the power
[1:29:29] they have to control everybody and what
[1:29:31] not uh fascism does in the same sense
[1:29:35] is Con control everything and everybody
[1:29:38] by one person that's why Nazism was a
[1:29:42] form of fascism because Hitler did that
[1:29:45] talked about the Jews all the time and
[1:29:48] everything that Hitler did but people a
[1:29:49] lot of times forget that Hitler killed
[1:29:51] his own people
[1:29:53] Hitler killed Germans he considered him
[1:29:55] pure
[1:29:56] Hitler
[1:29:57] sterilized people who had impurities in
[1:30:01] their lives or if you just had an
[1:30:03] impediment a stuttering or something he
[1:30:06] would have he would have neutered Moses
[1:30:09] because he was unpure Moses could have
[1:30:11] never reproduced because he was on pure
[1:30:14] he had a speech impediment anybody with
[1:30:17] any kind of any kind of impediment was
[1:30:19] considered impure and was either a a
[1:30:22] sterilized or or murdered killed one of
[1:30:26] the others his own people not just Jews
[1:30:29] anybody
[1:30:31] that was his thought that's why Nazism
[1:30:34] was so popular and as long as you're one
[1:30:36] of the ones considered pure it's great
[1:30:40] if you're one of the ones that have any
[1:30:42] kind of impediment
[1:30:44] it's not so great
[1:30:46] amen your life is controlled destroyed
[1:30:49] killed burned whatever it is
[1:30:52] that's how they control people the three
[1:30:55] unclean frogs that came out of their
[1:30:57] mouths I keep emphasizing that because I
[1:30:59] want to get to something here in just a
[1:31:01] minute I know I'm late but just a minute
[1:31:03] coming out of their mouths these three
[1:31:06] frogs come out of each one of their
[1:31:08] mouths look where it's going back and
[1:31:11] all of it winds up back in communism
[1:31:14] or excuse me in Catholicism
[1:31:17] all of it does because we know who
[1:31:19] controls it the Beast does
[1:31:22] you can have your communism you can have
[1:31:24] your Nazism you can have your fascism
[1:31:26] all socialism whatever it is
[1:31:30] but it's all controlled by that Beast
[1:31:32] who is controlled by that dragon
[1:31:35] so that's where it all comes to it goes
[1:31:38] to the office of the Beast
[1:31:40] mine all winds up it all winds up and
[1:31:44] that's where brother Brandon gets to now
[1:31:45] but these three Spirits communism
[1:31:48] fascism Nazism
[1:31:50] he said that brought out many years ago
[1:31:52] told you it'd be that thing that would
[1:31:54] take place while all wind up in
[1:31:56] communism
[1:31:58] all of it will wind up in communism
[1:32:01] that's the three unclean spirits that
[1:32:03] set the whole world to Armageddon the
[1:32:07] unclean Spirit now in the fourth seal
[1:32:09] let me read this real quick notice
[1:32:11] uh what is he coming to
[1:32:13] look at what all this I'm kind of
[1:32:15] skipping some so please forgive me
[1:32:19] um what's it all coming to
[1:32:21] it's coming to the End Time battle the
[1:32:25] first thing heaven was about amen like
[1:32:27] we said Lucifer was kicked out come to
[1:32:30] Earth he polluted Eden and and there's
[1:32:32] those things that's been polluting ever
[1:32:34] since and now from the battle in heaven
[1:32:36] is coming to a battle on Earth it has to
[1:32:39] be finished on the earth at the end time
[1:32:42] of the battle called Armageddon
[1:32:45] Armageddon now there's that arm again is
[1:32:49] that place where they all come and
[1:32:50] there's that great Slaughter Satan
[1:32:53] Gathering all of his people together and
[1:32:56] out of the mouths of these people this
[1:32:58] Beast the the dragon is coming those
[1:33:01] three unclean spirits but I want us to
[1:33:03] turn to Revelation 19. I'm going to try
[1:33:05] to finish this here I have to skip a
[1:33:07] couple things but revelation 19.
[1:33:16] Satan is gathering his prop together
[1:33:20] from the four corners of the earth just
[1:33:21] like God does
[1:33:23] amen just like remember everything Satan
[1:33:26] does is nothing but a a a a a copy of
[1:33:30] what God does
[1:33:32] back in the Garden of Eden Satan told
[1:33:35] them or God told them that the serpent
[1:33:39] would bruise the heel of the woman's
[1:33:41] seed Jesus Christ he's always on his
[1:33:45] heel always
[1:33:47] copy uh trying to write off the back up
[1:33:52] that's why there's three unclean spirits
[1:33:54] like frog just three well that's God's
[1:33:56] number
[1:33:57] Satan's just copying it everything he
[1:34:00] does he does to copy what God does
[1:34:04] and in a lot of ways again
[1:34:06] those two
[1:34:08] come so close together that people won't
[1:34:10] know the difference unless you have the
[1:34:12] Holy Ghost
[1:34:13] they just won't know
[1:34:15] it's that deceiving it deceives the very
[1:34:18] elective positive
[1:34:20] impossible thank God it's not possible
[1:34:22] Revelation 19 we know this scripture
[1:34:25] very well
[1:34:27] um let's start with verse 11.
[1:34:29] and I saw heaven open John the Revelator
[1:34:32] now saw heaven open and behold a white
[1:34:34] horse and he that sat upon him was
[1:34:37] called faithful and true and in
[1:34:40] righteous he does judge and make war now
[1:34:42] this is obviously in contrast to
[1:34:45] Revelation 6 and the White Horse comes
[1:34:48] forth and him conquering and to conquer
[1:34:50] that Satan this is not Satan
[1:34:54] the impurity of the hypocrisy
[1:34:58] of of Satan
[1:35:01] trying to present himself as pure
[1:35:04] through the Beast remember when the
[1:35:06] Beast is out and open he's always
[1:35:08] wearing white
[1:35:09] he always comes out to the general
[1:35:11] public in white he rides in his little
[1:35:14] poke mobile he's all white when he comes
[1:35:16] and stands out in the Basilica he's
[1:35:18] always always in white
[1:35:21] amen when he goes behind doors that's a
[1:35:23] different story he's got red and he's
[1:35:25] got black
[1:35:26] but this Y is the hypocrisy of trying to
[1:35:29] present himself as pure and holy but now
[1:35:33] God coming forth on a white horse is
[1:35:36] called faithful true and in
[1:35:39] righteousness he's not judge and make
[1:35:41] war that's not Satan that's God that's
[1:35:43] Jesus Christ
[1:35:45] his eyes was a flame of fire you're
[1:35:48] gonna read Revelation one you see that's
[1:35:50] Jesus and on his head were many crowns
[1:35:53] or diadems and he had a name written
[1:35:57] that no man knew but he himself and he
[1:36:01] was clothed with a Vester dipped in
[1:36:03] Blood and his name is called the word of
[1:36:06] God amen amen
[1:36:08] the other one
[1:36:10] it was death and Hell Followed him right
[1:36:14] this one is the word of God
[1:36:18] because Satan's Trinity is death hell in
[1:36:22] the grave
[1:36:24] praise the Lord which of course the hell
[1:36:27] Hades is the grave uh and and that
[1:36:30] always follows to humanity it always
[1:36:32] follows the grave when he came into
[1:36:34] Power this Earth that's what he
[1:36:36] implemented Satan implemented death
[1:36:40] death came on humans because God said it
[1:36:42] would
[1:36:43] and he took that death and put a human
[1:36:46] in the grave back to the dust from once
[1:36:48] they came
[1:36:49] 80s
[1:36:50] amen that's his Trinity God is the word
[1:36:54] amen and his name is called the word of
[1:36:58] God
[1:36:59] and the armies which were in heaven
[1:37:01] praise the Lord look around
[1:37:04] you see a little bit of that Army amen a
[1:37:07] little bit of the Army's right here this
[1:37:08] morning amen
[1:37:10] the armies of Heaven followed him upon
[1:37:13] white horses clothed in fine linen white
[1:37:17] and clean praise God because she's the
[1:37:19] bride she is his wife and he is proud of
[1:37:23] her
[1:37:24] he wants to show his bride off to
[1:37:26] anybody and everybody because he loves
[1:37:29] her and he's proud of her God is proud
[1:37:33] of you Saints God loves you you're a
[1:37:36] part of that Army you're a part of the
[1:37:38] ones in heaven here that come out white
[1:37:40] horses with him clean and white and out
[1:37:44] of his mouth goeth a sharp sword now
[1:37:47] what goes out of his mouth
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:51] not devils not unclean frogs not unclean
[1:37:56] spirits but the word of God comes out of
[1:37:58] his mouth a short sword going forth out
[1:38:02] of his mouth you can go and find this in
[1:38:04] Revelation 1 20. you can find it in
[1:38:06] second Thessalonians 2 8 and you can
[1:38:08] find it Revelation 1 16. it's the same
[1:38:11] thing the sword of God the sword of the
[1:38:14] word comes out of his mouth that's how
[1:38:17] God always remember brother Noel said
[1:38:19] last week that's what God actually
[1:38:21] fights his battles with
[1:38:23] we always like to talk about giving the
[1:38:25] devil a black eye but it's not with this
[1:38:27] thing it's with the word
[1:38:30] that's what gives him the black eye
[1:38:32] Satan fears your mere presence because
[1:38:35] you are the word walking in shoe leather
[1:38:39] and he knows that's the only thing
[1:38:40] that'll defeat him
[1:38:42] is the word
[1:38:43] praise the Lord don't let it Satan make
[1:38:46] you look at your mirror and think that
[1:38:47] you're some kind of something that
[1:38:49] you're not you look at God's mirror and
[1:38:51] you know who you are because that's what
[1:38:53] God has made you and God don't make any
[1:38:55] junk
[1:38:56] amen God made you as a son and daughter
[1:38:59] of God
[1:39:00] Purity and righteousness of God himself
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:05] and now the sword Goes Forth that within
[1:39:09] should Smite the Nations and he shall
[1:39:12] rule them with a rod of uh with a rod of
[1:39:14] iron now that's over in the new city
[1:39:17] that's not here that's a dual purpose
[1:39:20] scripture because if you go over we'll
[1:39:22] see we'll get to it we'll get to that
[1:39:24] city you'll see this is over in the new
[1:39:26] city he rules them with the rod of iron
[1:39:27] and he treaded The Wine Press of the
[1:39:30] fears of the wrath of almighty God and
[1:39:32] he had his best friend on his thigh
[1:39:34] named written king of kings and Lord of
[1:39:36] lords praise the Lord God himself they
[1:39:40] battled Armageddon they gather an
[1:39:42] Armageddon they battle at Armageddon the
[1:39:45] blood runs through just like the wash
[1:39:47] going down on a a on a stormy Monsoon
[1:39:52] afternoon
[1:39:53] that water that we see in those washers
[1:39:55] will flood right through but it'll be
[1:39:57] blood up to the horse's bridle it'll be
[1:40:00] so bad it'll be so murderous
[1:40:03] but God comes and with the sword of the
[1:40:06] word he destroys them all he ends the
[1:40:10] battle he ends the fight right there at
[1:40:13] that place Armageddon God stops it all
[1:40:17] he comes on a white horse with the
[1:40:19] armies of Heaven A White Horse behind
[1:40:21] him and the word coming forth out of his
[1:40:23] mouth he doesn't use Spears and swords
[1:40:26] and bombs and and guns and knives he
[1:40:30] uses the word
[1:40:32] the word is what destroys the word is
[1:40:35] what puts them in their in their place
[1:40:37] to the point that I saw an angel
[1:40:39] standing in the sun cry with a loud
[1:40:41] voice saying to all the fowls that fly
[1:40:43] in the midst of Heaven Come and gather
[1:40:46] your souls together unto the supper of
[1:40:48] the great God
[1:40:49] that ye may eat the Flesh of Kings and
[1:40:52] the Flesh of captains and the Flesh of
[1:40:54] Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and
[1:40:57] of them that sit on them and the Flesh
[1:40:59] of men both free bonds small and great
[1:41:03] amen battle is over
[1:41:06] God is Victorious
[1:41:09] God wins over all of it and he has to
[1:41:13] because we're getting because that that
[1:41:15] end of the the end of the Armageddon
[1:41:19] sets the stage
[1:41:21] for Christ to come back now in a
[1:41:25] Corporal body back with his glorified
[1:41:27] body back with his bride here on this
[1:41:31] Earth from for a millennium reign of a
[1:41:33] thousand years
[1:41:34] amen we leave here we meet him in the
[1:41:38] air we've spent three and a half years
[1:41:40] at a wedding supper we go to the Palace
[1:41:42] God takes cure uh business with the Jews
[1:41:45] and we come back with him on white
[1:41:48] horses and we stand Victorious here
[1:41:50] through a Thousand-Year malane a
[1:41:53] millennium reign God breaking the curse
[1:41:57] of the original sin
[1:41:59] finally and for all we're one man we're
[1:42:03] men not just one but any man any person
[1:42:06] any human lives on this Earth for one
[1:42:10] thousand years for one full day with God
[1:42:12] it never happened since the fall
[1:42:14] Millennium came the closest 969 years
[1:42:18] but there hasn't been one single human
[1:42:20] live
[1:42:21] recorded scripture has not lived one day
[1:42:24] with God
[1:42:25] amen 1000 years that'll break the curse
[1:42:30] of the original sin that broke that man
[1:42:33] in his eternal life in the beginning
[1:42:35] it'll be shattered and broken and done
[1:42:37] away with
[1:42:39] God and his bride will live here
[1:42:41] for a thousand years Satan will be bound
[1:42:44] a thousand years will have no sense for
[1:42:47] them amen let's stand if we could
[1:42:57] praise the Lord
[1:43:01] amen I believe that
[1:43:08] no God
[1:43:10] comes forth
[1:43:12] with his
[1:43:14] weapon of choice
[1:43:16] and that's the word of God
[1:43:20] Satan comes with his
[1:43:22] and that's the perversion of the word
[1:43:26] but God's the one that takes control
[1:43:29] over the whole thing
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:32] by his word
[1:43:34] through his spirit
[1:43:38] he does it all for our betterment amen
[1:43:41] because he loves us
[1:43:43] right so that's why I give his life for
[1:43:45] us that's why he was willing to spend
[1:43:48] the last
[1:43:51] moments of his life in pure agony
[1:43:55] because he loves us so much
[1:43:58] you think about that
[1:43:59] think about it as a human is there
[1:44:01] anybody on this planet Earth that you
[1:44:03] know that you would do that for
[1:44:07] amen it's a hard question a lot of
[1:44:10] people would jump and say oh I do it
[1:44:13] do it before I do it for mature
[1:44:15] but you know when it comes right down to
[1:44:16] it just like Jesus and the garden gets
[1:44:18] anything and his sweat became ass drops
[1:44:21] of blood
[1:44:22] he sweated it out he fought it out all
[1:44:25] those demons coming around and he fought
[1:44:27] it out remember brother brother green
[1:44:29] even pointed out I don't know what I've
[1:44:30] never been there but that Jesus even to
[1:44:33] get there had to cross over that trough
[1:44:35] for Channel or whatever it was where all
[1:44:38] the sacrifices that were sacrificed up
[1:44:41] by the Jews had all that blood had to
[1:44:43] run right down through there
[1:44:45] and just the father it's not scripture
[1:44:47] but one of brother Green's analogies and
[1:44:49] Jesus had he had to go that path
[1:44:52] Jesus had to go that path and go over
[1:44:54] that blood you imagine what what may
[1:44:57] have gone through a human Jesus mind and
[1:45:00] he saw that and recognizing the great
[1:45:02] sacrifice that he was
[1:45:04] amen when he comes right down to it
[1:45:06] Saints amen
[1:45:09] it is a it is a bit harder than probably
[1:45:12] a lot of people think but
[1:45:16] it's it's a lot of it's a it's in a lot
[1:45:19] of ways like people oh if if I won the
[1:45:21] lottery I
[1:45:22] the first thing I do is pay my tithes
[1:45:25] I I do this and I do that as
[1:45:29] you don't know what you do until it
[1:45:31] happens
[1:45:32] and then of course something great
[1:45:33] happens or good happens or something and
[1:45:35] you never see them again
[1:45:38] don't mean that the bad way
[1:45:40] amen that's just the way it's just the
[1:45:42] way it happens so many times
[1:45:44] I guess it's the it's the Rubber meets
[1:45:48] the road analogy when it comes right
[1:45:50] down to it only God knows amen even we
[1:45:54] don't even know ourselves praise the
[1:45:56] Lord let's sing this course
[1:45:59] um
[1:46:00] I want to live the way he wants me to
[1:46:02] live and we've seen that to him now
[1:46:04] see it with all of our hearts here
[1:46:06] that's just that that's your desire is
[1:46:09] 493 in the songbook I don't know what I
[1:46:12] think we all do but 493 I want to live
[1:46:14] the way he wants me to live praise the
[1:46:17] Lord
[1:46:19] and God knows if that's your real desire
[1:46:21] or not see the Bible says I want to live
[1:46:26] it doesn't say I am living
[1:46:29] because that's
[1:46:31] in my human flesh I don't know if I'll
[1:46:33] ever live the way I want to live
[1:46:36] but I know through him knows my heart in
[1:46:39] what I want to do what my desire is amen
[1:46:42] yes

[1:47:03] I want to love
[1:47:06] love to you there's just no no more love
[1:47:12] oh I could never ever
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:34] until there's just
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:56] way to him now
[1:47:59] going to live
[1:48:02] away
[1:48:04] he wants me to live I'm going to give
[1:48:11] until there's just no more to hear I'm
[1:48:18] going to love
[1:48:21] love till there's just no more love oh I
[1:48:28] could ever ever
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:35] and
[1:48:37] and praise the Lord Jesus I trust
[1:48:39] believe that's all our desires today
[1:48:40] amen praise the Lord I'm going to live I
[1:48:44] desire to live the way he wants me to
[1:48:47] live amen not the way I want to live all
[1:48:50] that he does he does it for his purpose
[1:48:54] but all his purpose works together for
[1:48:57] our good and so we should want the exact
[1:49:01] same thing but regardless
[1:49:04] I want what he wants and if I can do
[1:49:07] whatever I can do to help make that
[1:49:08] happen more to help me
