[23:03] dad andy is that correct andy her
[23:06] stepdad he is very weak and sickly at 87

[23:42] more to life than making a living and
[23:44] having a good time amen brother that's
[23:47] the truth
[23:48] praise the lord people could just
[23:49] understand and realize what a good time

[24:19] live through it how they can sustain i
[24:21] said well
[24:22] uh i don't either
[24:24] but i think a lot of people they either
[24:26] a lot of people kill themselves but most
[24:28] people just drown themselves in alcohol
[24:31] or drugs or something that's that's the
[24:33] only way they can sustain life they
[24:35] think that's living
[24:37] sustaining life is from the bottom of a
[24:39] bottle but thank god i know better amen
[24:42] let's get my stimulation from the
[24:43] revelation of the holy spirit amen amen
[24:46] praise the lord sister norma has a

[28:35] you know sister priscilla came through
[28:37] her procedure well uh she's doing good
[28:41] awake god blessed her the doctor did the
[28:44] doctor actually did not give her a very
[28:46] good chance of waking back up from the
[28:48] anesthesia
[28:49] but the surgery went well took three and
[28:52] a half four hours i forgot what he told
[28:53] me three and a half hours so it took a
[28:55] long time
[28:56] as parts of her intestinal colon that
[28:59] was inflamed so much that the doctor was
[29:01] afraid if she
[29:02] scraped it the wrong way or mis moved
[29:05] somewhere that it would rupture it and
[29:08] be even worse so
[29:10] god bless the doctor in this case
[29:13] uh that took her time and went in and
[29:16] the operation was successful and he
[29:17] punctured it draining it so thankful for
[29:20] that unfortunately the doctor went out
[29:22] of town and of course priscilla came
[29:24] back woke back up praise the lord
[29:27] so we're thankful to god for that
[29:29] that's a miracle saints to me i consider
[29:32] it that way
[29:33] but then the doctor went out of town
[29:35] and she left instruction for her team
[29:38] and for the nurses not to give priscilla
[29:41] very much pain meds
[29:43] so
[29:44] last yesterday last night sister
[29:46] priscilla was in extreme excruciating
[29:49] pain
[29:50] and they couldn't get a hold of the
[29:52] doctor nobody was allowed to change the
[29:54] order uh brother uh
[29:57] angel mentioned a couple of nurses to me
[29:59] so i want to call their name out here
[30:01] that was so kind to sister priscilla
[30:04] um
[30:06] let me see if i could find their names
[30:07] here
[30:09] christine
[30:10] and lydia
[30:12] were the two nurses names that really
[30:14] took after priscilla to help her to do
[30:16] they what they could to get her meds and
[30:19] antibiotics up to word some painkiller
[30:22] to make her comfortable
[30:23] um they actually finally they did it
[30:26] themselves they actually moved it and
[30:28] they weren't supposed to a doctor came
[30:30] in and assessed it and he put it to work
[30:33] she could be comfortable
[30:34] uh he talked to priscilla this morning
[30:38] she felt sounded much better she wasn't
[30:40] in this much pain
[30:43] discomfort of course but not in the pain
[30:45] that she was so thank god for that
[30:48] she can now eat clear liquids
[30:50] uh
[30:52] not solids yet but coming up soon
[30:55] and he says of course according with the
[30:58] doctor said when she's able to start
[31:00] eating and passing uh having bowel
[31:03] movements she can go home
[31:05] so we're going to pray that's going to
[31:06] be very quick amen so she can go home
[31:09] i'm just of the advocacy
[31:11] that a hospital is no place for sick
[31:14] people
[31:16] the best place to get well is at home
[31:19] you want to get well go home as quickly
[31:22] as you possibly can you get
[31:25] well faster at home than you do in a
[31:27] hospital my humble opinion i'm not a
[31:29] doctor physician or anything
[31:32] but from my experience with what i've
[31:33] seen and visit hospitals or visit people
[31:36] seen people in hospitals and all
[31:40] and people
[31:41] get the sicknesses while they're in the
[31:43] hospital i've seen people get well and
[31:45] stay in the hospital and get sick again
[31:47] while they're there
[31:49] just go home get well that's that's my
[31:51] motto
[31:53] uh so we're hoping praying i'm hoping
[31:55] pray she goes home and that uh and then
[31:58] she gets well amen so praise the lord
[32:01] brother angel gave a little more exhort
[32:04] exhortation in that text but you got the
[32:07] gist and we're very thankful god bless
[32:10] sister priscilla god touched her healed
[32:12] her amen uh also one more
[32:17] my wife's client kay she was mine and
[32:20] her client that she takes around to
[32:21] doctor's appointments and things got a
[32:23] bad infection
[32:24] sore on her ankle foot uh and
[32:29] was hoping it was going to get better
[32:30] and go away been treating it but it's
[32:32] getting worse
[32:33] uh so
[32:35] that's how i got her to begin with well
[32:37] through somebody else but she had sores
[32:39] on her that i took her to the wound care
[32:42] center and
[32:43] those for some reason on her they just
[32:45] don't heal quickly so her name is kay
[32:48] again
[32:49] um i guess she's in her 80s
[32:52] but
[32:53] sonia takes her around the doctor's
[32:55] appointment shop for a little bit things
[32:56] like that so
[32:58] uh please remember k in prayer if you
[32:59] would
[33:00] lord would just touch that ankle and
[33:02] help make it better amen
[33:05] praise the lord amen so we're thankful
[33:07] for that you have my unspoken requests
[33:09] man i think we covered pretty much

[47:05] two days deeper for two days a sore
[47:07] throat hit um
[47:09] and it's all pretty bad for you because
[47:11] i've had papers and stuff before usually

[47:15] was persistent and
[47:18] i
[47:19] i've been making fun of the devil for
[47:21] picking on my nephew
[47:24] so i think it was a targeted attack
[47:25] because whatever i got from wherever i
[47:28] got it i've always been around someone
[47:30] mom and daddy the kids exact have at the
[47:33] friends no one else has got sick or got

[47:57] because my voice wasn't working but
[48:00] um i asked the lord if he would
[48:03] give me good enough to where i could see
[48:05] um and i was able to sing with the
[48:07] congregation so i'm going to try this
[48:08] one because it was on my heart while i
[48:10] was thinking that
[48:12] this week so i hope it's a blessing to
[48:14] you amen
[48:16] [Music]
[48:21] i thought
[48:23] number one
[48:25] would surely
[48:28] be me
[48:30] i thought i could be
[48:34] what i wanted
[48:36] to be
[48:38] i thought that i could build
[48:42] on life
[48:44] [Music]
[48:57] without you holding
[49:00] my hand
[49:03] [Music]
[49:35] i

[50:26] [Music]
[50:34] without you holding me amen

[52:27] how truthful that is can't even walk
[52:29] without him holding our hands
[52:31] praise the lord jesus
[52:33] amen
[52:36] let's stand if we could
[52:38] and then we're going to
[52:40] change all of the service now get into
[52:42] the scripture
[52:47] saw me reach for my phone sony got a
[52:50] text from sister theresa
[52:52] um
[52:54] and she sent
[52:55] the message she sent through said that
[52:58] she was just very exhausted
[53:00] and that they're supposed to be putting
[53:02] charlie in hospice care
[53:05] taking him to a hospice place don't know
[53:07] which one yet
[53:08] um
[53:09] that's just a lot of the devil i don't
[53:11] know why they're taking them to
[53:13] he's awake cognizant breathing on his
[53:16] own
[53:17] i don't understand
[53:19] just
[53:20] i don't know if they're just trying to
[53:21] kill people today i don't understand yes
[53:26] sometimes people going to hospice can
[53:28] get better yeah
[53:32] so he might be able to just do it on his
[53:34] own
[53:37] that might be a good thing
[53:39] it could be insurance too
[53:42] i know that's kind of the way it seemed
[53:43] like it was with julie's dad
[53:46] uh every time it got to a place that the
[53:48] insurance started running out that
[53:50] shipped him someplace else and
[53:52] and something else happened and shipped
[53:54] him over here and they put him in a
[53:57] hospice or assisted living or something
[53:59] and when the money run out then they
[54:00] shipped him someplace else so that could
[54:02] be it too yeah
[54:04] but my wife's right i've known a lot of
[54:06] people come out of hospice
[54:09] you know um
[54:10] but you know
[54:12] hospice uh it does a lot of good things
[54:16] uh but sometimes
[54:18] it's just it's just sad that our whole
[54:20] system seems to have just become about
[54:22] money right it really is it's just sad
[54:26] that it just seemed to have come without
[54:28] about money
[54:29] but
[54:31] but
[54:32] god's hands on brother charlie so
[54:35] um
[54:36] i just thank god god's with brother
[54:38] charlie and that's that's just the end
[54:40] of that for me i
[54:42] i haven't fretted about it i haven't
[54:44] actually fret about brother charlie in
[54:47] two or three weeks now honestly um
[54:51] i haven't been concerned over it i still
[54:52] pray for him i still keep him before the
[54:54] lord every day
[54:55] um
[54:56] but
[54:57] it hasn't i haven't just like the other
[54:59] day i mean i don't put it out but
[55:02] the other a couple days ago i got such a
[55:05] piece about priscilla
[55:07] i i priscilla just wasn't going to die i
[55:10] knew she wasn't
[55:13] but we prayed for her amen and keep her
[55:15] before the lord but it was just
[55:17] something that
[55:18] just came on my heart
[55:20] like i told you last week and all i can
[55:22] tell you i'm not telling you i'm
[55:24] prophesying i'm just telling you what
[55:25] the lord puts on my heart and that's all
[55:27] i can tell you is what the lord puts on
[55:29] my heart
[55:31] maybe it is prophecy i don't know
[55:33] i'm not a prophet to say to prophesy i
[55:36] just know what i feel the lord puts in
[55:38] my heart and the spirit that i feel
[55:40] and
[55:41] that's where i'm at so but we do
[55:44] continue to remember brother charlie in
[55:45] prayer and my wife maybe
[55:48] i believe she is exactly right sometimes
[55:51] it goes in a different environment and
[55:52] it's a a lot of times hospice is a lot
[55:55] nicer place it's not all
[55:57] chrome and styrofoam and whatever the
[56:00] hospitals are you know
[56:02] it's just a different environment so
[56:04] maybe maybe they'll let us go in and see
[56:06] him too i don't know i hope so
[56:08] um i hope so but we'll see
[56:11] anyway that's the message sister theresa
[56:13] uh sent to us so
[56:15] brother angel sent me a message and said
[56:17] yes better at home so i'm believing
[56:18] sister teresa and brother angel and i
[56:21] don't know if you sit with priscilla but
[56:22] we love you and sister sheila is going
[56:24] to be streaming so
[56:26] we love you miss you if sister matisse
[56:27] if you're there too amen god knows amen
[56:30] but we'll get to the word now amen turn
[56:32] to saint mark chapter 5

[59:21] familiar story
[59:22] amen i will
[59:24] we'll read this and let you be seated
[59:26] and he said unto her daughter
[59:28] thy faith has made thee whole go in
[59:31] peace and be whole of thy plague you
[59:34] could be seated if you'd like
[59:38] diane cavett sang a song last week kind
[59:40] of inspired this to my heart and after
[59:43] last week and i don't mind telling you
[59:45] last week
[59:46] i enjoyed the spirit of the lord with us
[59:48] so much and
[59:49] trust the obedience to the lord but it
[59:51] was hard on me uh
[59:54] that's just frank with you it's just
[59:56] hard on me
[59:57] uh bringing services and messages like
[59:59] that just just aren't easy i don't like
[1:00:01] doing that
[1:00:02] again
[1:00:04] i thought about the weeping prophets
[1:00:07] and
[1:00:08] what all he had to go through with the
[1:00:10] cursings that he continually gave to the
[1:00:13] to the country it had been really hard
[1:00:15] on him but uh things like that just uh
[1:00:18] it's truth you know what the scripture
[1:00:21] declares it
[1:00:22] but it just it's just hard to go into
[1:00:24] but they inspired me with that song they
[1:00:26] sang last week and
[1:00:28] and after that i felt like that
[1:00:31] unless the lord changed it to something
[1:00:33] else that i would just try to speak on
[1:00:35] maybe a little message of faith today
[1:00:38] and i titled the message today touching
[1:00:40] jesus which obviously goes of course
[1:00:43] along with the songs that i
[1:00:44] chose to sing today and of course this
[1:00:47] uh story in the bible that the lord gave
[1:00:49] us to to understand and to and to abide
[1:00:52] by but let's just read the whole story
[1:00:54] through again we know it by heart i'm
[1:00:56] sure we do we know the woman with the
[1:00:58] blood issue and what she went through
[1:01:00] what she was doing and her healing and
[1:01:02] all but let's read uh um
[1:01:06] let's see here let's just begin with
[1:01:07] verse 23.
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:14] mark 5 23 and besought him greatly
[1:01:16] saying my little daughter lieth at the
[1:01:18] point of death i pray thee come and lay
[1:01:20] thy hands on her that she may be healed
[1:01:24] and she shall live
[1:01:26] jesus went with him and much people
[1:01:29] followed him and thronged him
[1:01:32] and a certain woman which had an issue
[1:01:34] of blood 12 years i found it kind of
[1:01:36] interesting that this man jarius who
[1:01:39] went to go heal his daughter she was 12
[1:01:42] years old
[1:01:43] so it was it was unusual that jesus was
[1:01:46] going along the path
[1:01:48] to heal a girl that was 12 years old
[1:01:51] when along the journey she ill she
[1:01:54] he well he
[1:01:56] she received healing
[1:01:58] of uh of an issue that she had had for
[1:02:01] 12 years
[1:02:02] uh
[1:02:03] i don't know the spiritual significance
[1:02:05] to that if there is any i just found it
[1:02:07] unusual she had that issue for 12 years
[1:02:09] and the person that jesus was going to
[1:02:11] lay his hands on was 12 years old
[1:02:15] but at a certain woman had an issue of
[1:02:17] blood 12 years
[1:02:19] and had suffered many things of many
[1:02:21] physicians and has been all that she had
[1:02:25] and was nothing better but rather grew
[1:02:27] worse
[1:02:29] when she had heard of jesus
[1:02:31] came in the press behind and touched his
[1:02:34] garment
[1:02:35] for she said if i may touch but his
[1:02:38] clothes i shall behold
[1:02:41] and straightway the fountain of her
[1:02:43] blood was dried up and she felt in her
[1:02:46] body that she was healed of that plague
[1:02:49] now listen how the progression of this
[1:02:51] story goes just told by mark of course
[1:02:52] here it's told a little different by
[1:02:54] luke but and a little different by
[1:02:56] matthew but um
[1:02:58] the premise of the story stays the same
[1:03:00] but follow the progression of the story
[1:03:02] see now and jesus immediately
[1:03:05] knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[1:03:07] out of him turned him about in the press
[1:03:10] and said who touched my clothes
[1:03:13] his disciples said unto him thou seest
[1:03:15] the multitude thronging thee and sayest
[1:03:18] thou who touched thee
[1:03:20] you know in other words jesus be quiet
[1:03:22] people will think you're mental
[1:03:24] people who think you've lost your mind
[1:03:26] lord you know
[1:03:27] there's people touching you and grabbing
[1:03:29] you and holding you and thronging you
[1:03:31] and you're setting who touched me
[1:03:33] everybody around here that's within
[1:03:34] arm's reach has touched you
[1:03:36] oh but he looked around he said but
[1:03:39] virtue has gone out of me see
[1:03:41] uh he didn't say it here
[1:03:43] mark didn't record that but luke did
[1:03:46] and he looked around to about to see her
[1:03:49] that had done this thing but the woman
[1:03:51] fearing and trembling knowing what was
[1:03:54] done
[1:03:55] in her came and fell down before him and
[1:03:58] told him all the truth and he said unto
[1:04:01] her daughter thy faith
[1:04:03] has made thee whole go in peace be whole
[1:04:05] of thy plague while yet spake there came
[1:04:08] from the ruler of the synagogue's house
[1:04:10] certain which said thy daughter is dead
[1:04:12] why trouble thou
[1:04:13] the master any further
[1:04:16] and as soon as jesus heard the word that
[1:04:18] was spoken he said unto the ruler of the
[1:04:21] synagogue be not afraid only believe
[1:04:24] amen amen now we got this story here
[1:04:27] this uh woman with the blood issue and
[1:04:30] again as i wanted to point out as i
[1:04:32] pointed out to you to watch the
[1:04:33] progression of this story and see how it
[1:04:36] unfolded because it's very uh uplifting
[1:04:40] to us i believe to be able to have
[1:04:42] encouragement from in faith to see what
[1:04:44] this woman was able to receive from
[1:04:46] christ
[1:04:47] and the way she did now a lot of it of
[1:04:50] course is according to our faith
[1:04:53] uh jesus said that many times be it unto
[1:04:56] thee according to thy faith so it's it
[1:04:59] it's at the level of your faith and the
[1:05:01] levels of faith that each one of us have
[1:05:04] in most cases a lot of times is a little
[1:05:06] different now there'll be a time
[1:05:08] obviously when all of us bribe
[1:05:10] internationally will get to that level
[1:05:12] by hearing of the word of god to a
[1:05:15] rapturing faith the world will change
[1:05:17] our bodies and we'll go home to be with
[1:05:19] him amen but in living our lives and
[1:05:21] going through and depending on of course
[1:05:24] how much our lives are dedicated to the
[1:05:27] lord how much we read how much we pray
[1:05:29] uh coming to church and
[1:05:31] the ministering of things that build our
[1:05:33] faith and hearing of the word of god
[1:05:36] because remember that's what brings that
[1:05:37] faith that's what builds that faith
[1:05:39] that's what encourages and and exercises
[1:05:41] that faith up to a strong faith that you
[1:05:44] have the faith that you need to meet the
[1:05:46] circumstance when it comes to you it's
[1:05:49] like the song i sing friend uh this
[1:05:51] mckamey miss mckamey she is i'll call
[1:05:54] her sister mckamey she had that vision
[1:05:57] you know that at that one moment and you
[1:05:59] know it's true in life so many times at
[1:06:02] that one moment everything seems to be
[1:06:04] perfect everything's going great
[1:06:06] everything's wonderful and then all of a
[1:06:08] sudden bam the next second in life it
[1:06:11] seems like everything is turned upside
[1:06:13] down
[1:06:14] i mean it was strange of course it
[1:06:16] happened that way with me and my wife
[1:06:18] and uh when our first son was born you
[1:06:20] know you're happy you're gonna be new
[1:06:22] parents and you're gonna bring forth
[1:06:24] life into the world and then all of a
[1:06:26] sudden bam and
[1:06:28] you don't realize what's going on or why
[1:06:30] it's going on but you go from way up
[1:06:32] here to way down here in just moments it
[1:06:34] seems like
[1:06:35] uh i know with sister priscilla she was
[1:06:38] uh the friday night we were there with
[1:06:40] them at mariah's birthday party
[1:06:43] peter piper and and enjoying one
[1:06:45] another's company and having fellowship
[1:06:47] and enjoying a little bit of pizza and
[1:06:49] just enjoying life and the next thing i
[1:06:51] know brother angel's called me and says
[1:06:52] she's in the hospital
[1:06:54] i mean it's just like from here to here
[1:06:56] that quickly
[1:06:58] and it can happen that quickly
[1:07:00] now where is your faith going to me be
[1:07:02] to meet that when it does happen see
[1:07:05] that's just that's the place that we're
[1:07:06] looking for now
[1:07:08] to come to that place to all of a sudden
[1:07:10] build a ton of faith after it's happened
[1:07:12] is very
[1:07:13] difficult because faith gets built over
[1:07:16] a period of time
[1:07:17] brother branham referred to faith as
[1:07:19] muscles
[1:07:20] you know that yes
[1:07:23] a couple of places brother branham
[1:07:24] referred to faith as muscles you build
[1:07:26] your muscles you exercise your muscles
[1:07:29] well you don't go to the gym one day and
[1:07:31] spend two hours working out come out
[1:07:33] looking like arnold schwarzenegger
[1:07:35] it doesn't work that way the hulk lou
[1:07:37] ferrigno or who any of these
[1:07:38] bodybuilders you don't go in in a couple
[1:07:40] hours and come out all buffed up and
[1:07:42] looking like a giant doesn't work that
[1:07:45] way they hit the gym day after day after
[1:07:47] day hour after hour after hour taking
[1:07:49] care of their bodies eating and drinking
[1:07:51] the right stuff and see that's the same
[1:07:53] thing that happens with faith brother
[1:07:54] branham referred to that as muscle it
[1:07:56] takes time
[1:07:58] so when you when you're met with this as
[1:08:00] we call the valley uh
[1:08:03] it's not the time to go prayed up or try
[1:08:05] to get that faith that you need to meet
[1:08:07] that challenge your faith should already
[1:08:09] be there to meet that challenge so when
[1:08:11] the challenge comes you can face it
[1:08:13] head-on
[1:08:14] you can meet that challenge that's why
[1:08:16] we live our lives the way we do that's
[1:08:18] why we do the things we do that's why we
[1:08:20] take care of our bodies our spiritual
[1:08:22] bodies we eat and drink the right things
[1:08:25] amen we partake of the correct things so
[1:08:27] that we're prepared we listen to the
[1:08:29] word of god we let the word of god feed
[1:08:32] us we read the word of god see because
[1:08:34] the faith comes by hearing that word and
[1:08:36] that continues to build that faith and
[1:08:39] it comes to
[1:08:40] uh you know the the
[1:08:42] a person who has little bitty muscles or
[1:08:45] a person that has the giant muscles now
[1:08:47] we're talking about physical anymore
[1:08:48] we're talking about spiritual faith
[1:08:50] faith muscles amen have that faith
[1:08:53] muscle so when the enemy tries to come
[1:08:55] and he tries to hit your head on just
[1:08:57] poop and manifesting he's done
[1:09:00] right amen not physically of course the
[1:09:02] spirituals not this warfare is not of
[1:09:04] the flesh it's the spiritual warfare but
[1:09:06] you you're in that spiritual position
[1:09:08] when the devil comes up
[1:09:10] amen how many times we heard the story
[1:09:12] boo
[1:09:14] how many times you heard the story about
[1:09:15] old uh
[1:09:17] i just call him
[1:09:18] grandpa works i guess uh that when he
[1:09:21] had that dream the devil coming he's big
[1:09:23] muscles and built up and he's just gonna
[1:09:25] crush it down to nothing and all of a
[1:09:27] sudden he just
[1:09:28] he in his dream mustered up enough
[1:09:30] strength to just say boo and he noticed
[1:09:32] the devil got smaller boom the devil got
[1:09:34] smaller and he just kept getting smaller
[1:09:36] and smarter he kept getting bigger and
[1:09:37] bigger before the devil just poof he was
[1:09:39] gone
[1:09:40] amen it takes that kind of and but but
[1:09:43] it didn't happen just off of one thing
[1:09:46] or one time it takes time so it takes
[1:09:49] time for us
[1:09:50] to build ourselves to the place that we
[1:09:52] have the faith to meet that how many
[1:09:55] times you hear in a message where
[1:09:57] brother adam tells a congregation
[1:09:59] uh
[1:10:01] he that he brings a specific message and
[1:10:04] he tries to talk to them encourage them
[1:10:06] to the place that it helps increase
[1:10:08] their faith
[1:10:10] even just enough at that moment so they
[1:10:13] can receive what they're wanting by
[1:10:15] coming there right amen amen he says
[1:10:18] that many times he says i'm just here to
[1:10:20] try to help build your faith
[1:10:23] he talked to that little girl that
[1:10:24] remember that one time that girl come up
[1:10:26] and she said oh yes i got faith he said
[1:10:28] no you don't i mean i'm paraphrasing of
[1:10:30] course just go sit down and watch the
[1:10:33] prayer line a little bit it'll help
[1:10:34] build your faith
[1:10:35] and another one come up that'll come up
[1:10:37] no she just didn't get it yet another
[1:10:39] one come up no just didn't get it yet
[1:10:40] but when it was her time
[1:10:42] and after watching that and after seeing
[1:10:44] god on display and increasing her faith
[1:10:47] she got to the place to where she come
[1:10:49] up and she received what she needed
[1:10:51] amen
[1:10:52] praise the lord
[1:10:54] many times it brings us to that point of
[1:10:56] faith it's just a simple part of
[1:10:59] touching jesus now
[1:11:01] what was it of the faith of this woman
[1:11:04] that she had that she needed to get what
[1:11:06] she wanted
[1:11:08] her faith was to the point
[1:11:10] that she said in herself
[1:11:13] if i can just touch his garment
[1:11:16] if i can just touch the hem of his
[1:11:17] garment if i can just touch his clothes
[1:11:20] i don't even need to touch him
[1:11:22] if i can just touch his clothes that was
[1:11:25] where her faith was that's why she said
[1:11:27] that in herself
[1:11:28] different people say different things
[1:11:30] for different reasons oh if i could just
[1:11:32] have this oh if i could just touch this
[1:11:36] or whatever it is that's where their
[1:11:38] faith level is her faith level was to
[1:11:41] the place that she and herself said if i
[1:11:43] could just touch his clothes
[1:11:46] then i'll be well right that's where she
[1:11:48] was that's where god
[1:11:50] met her
[1:11:51] amen and that's what touched jesus
[1:11:56] that's what
[1:11:57] she didn't touch him physically she just
[1:12:00] touched his garment
[1:12:01] well with all the people around him how
[1:12:04] could he have known that there was one
[1:12:05] that touched him because strength left
[1:12:07] him
[1:12:08] the strength left him to go in and heal
[1:12:10] her now notice notice in the scripture
[1:12:14] when she touched him
[1:12:16] straightway the fountain of her blood
[1:12:19] was dried up and she felt her body was
[1:12:22] healed from that plague
[1:12:24] immediately she was healed
[1:12:27] praise god
[1:12:29] do you recognize that according to the
[1:12:31] writings here that she was probably she
[1:12:34] actually probably received healing
[1:12:36] before jesus even knew about it
[1:12:40] we always want to call jesus on the
[1:12:42] scene but you know this woman it would
[1:12:45] appear as though it was at least if
[1:12:47] nothing else it was
[1:12:48] immediate that she was healed before
[1:12:51] jesus could even turn around and say who
[1:12:53] touched me when he turned around and
[1:12:55] recognized the virtue had left him and
[1:12:57] turned around and said who touched me
[1:12:59] she was already healed
[1:13:01] amen she had already received her
[1:13:03] healing amen right amen
[1:13:05] oh thank you he just realized she was
[1:13:08] before she was healed before jesus even
[1:13:11] knew what was going on
[1:13:12] because she came up behind him the bible
[1:13:14] said
[1:13:15] i don't think this story accounts it but
[1:13:17] i think matthew and or uh yeah matthew
[1:13:19] and luke account she came up from behind
[1:13:21] him
[1:13:22] touched uh just touched his garment from
[1:13:25] behind
[1:13:26] praise the lord and everybody around was
[1:13:29] was touching him and throwing him but
[1:13:31] that one lady so what did she touch she
[1:13:34] didn't touch what she touched his
[1:13:35] garment because that was but it was
[1:13:37] where her faith level was
[1:13:38] it was her faith that touched him amen
[1:13:41] there's only one way to touch him today
[1:13:43] you must believe
[1:13:45] when you call on his name that's the
[1:13:46] only way to touch him today it's the
[1:13:48] same today as it was then only way to
[1:13:51] touch him he's not hearing a physical
[1:13:52] body anymore that we could see a
[1:13:54] tangible a body except of course his
[1:13:57] bride but jesus himself in a tangible
[1:13:59] body to touch or to touch his garment or
[1:14:02] to speak to or have him pray over us or
[1:14:04] something to that sort
[1:14:06] but our faith can reach out that's
[1:14:08] that's what we we touch him with
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:12] no brother branham had no power other
[1:14:16] than what god gave him right
[1:14:18] and it wasn't his power to use it was
[1:14:22] god using it through him yes
[1:14:25] that's why the angel of the lord said
[1:14:27] get the people to believe you
[1:14:30] and be sincere when you pray
[1:14:32] then nothing will stand before your
[1:14:34] prayer why because that's the love and
[1:14:36] the faith that you reach to be able to
[1:14:38] accomplish the scripture
[1:14:40] the scriptural precedent which we'll
[1:14:42] read a little bit later that's what the
[1:14:44] bible says
[1:14:45] sincerity
[1:14:46] love and sincerity brings faith get to
[1:14:49] people to believe faith
[1:14:51] which operates by love this sincerity
[1:14:53] which brings the result
[1:14:55] many people have different levels her
[1:14:58] level was right there and when she
[1:14:59] touched him it was by her faith
[1:15:02] not by her hand
[1:15:03] but that's where her level was now see
[1:15:05] if you had a if somebody there had had a
[1:15:08] different level of faith and jesus had
[1:15:09] been off in the corner somewhere
[1:15:12] or or been down the street or something
[1:15:14] and someone could say oh if i could just
[1:15:16] cast my eyes on him i would be healed
[1:15:19] then that would be their faith level
[1:15:21] to receive what they want
[1:15:23] they didn't even have to touch his
[1:15:24] clothes
[1:15:26] what's the faith level today
[1:15:28] we may not see him
[1:15:31] we may not feel him physically
[1:15:34] we may not uh uh be able to see a
[1:15:37] tangible body
[1:15:38] but our faith reaches him yes
[1:15:41] just as it does
[1:15:42] he doesn't even have to be here to see
[1:15:44] some people say well i gotta have him
[1:15:47] lay hands on me
[1:15:49] you know some people today oh with
[1:15:50] brother branham i've heard that oh
[1:15:52] brother branham we're still here well
[1:15:54] what about god right yes god didn't die
[1:15:57] with brother branham
[1:15:58] amen
[1:15:59] god didn't take away his gifts of the
[1:16:01] spirit when brother bradham passed the
[1:16:04] gifts of the spirit are still the same
[1:16:06] it just takes faith to operate it amen
[1:16:08] you just got to believe it but some are
[1:16:10] like oh if you would lay hands on me
[1:16:13] well that's where their faith is
[1:16:15] or if you just speak to me if you'll
[1:16:17] just give me a word and that's where
[1:16:19] some people's faith level is
[1:16:21] oh if i could just touch his garment
[1:16:23] that's where some are if i could just
[1:16:25] see him that's where theirs is
[1:16:28] where's ours
[1:16:30] where's our faith level right do we need
[1:16:33] to have somebody
[1:16:35] god in a corporal body here to touch you
[1:16:39] to lay a hand on you
[1:16:41] to pray over you
[1:16:43] to touch to look in his eye oh that
[1:16:46] would be wonderful i would like that too
[1:16:49] but our faith is what touches it am i
[1:16:51] amen our faith that's what touches god
[1:16:54] she was healed by her own faith
[1:16:57] jesus said see look here now he said
[1:17:00] daughter
[1:17:01] thy faith
[1:17:03] jesus didn't say i have healed you right
[1:17:05] jesus didn't say i make you well he said
[1:17:09] your faith
[1:17:11] your faith has made you whole go in
[1:17:13] peace
[1:17:14] it was her faith that did it
[1:17:17] jesus again jesus didn't even know what
[1:17:19] was going on he came up she came up from
[1:17:21] behind him and touched just his garment
[1:17:24] he didn't know what's going on she was
[1:17:26] healed immediately
[1:17:28] and jesus what happened
[1:17:30] who did that
[1:17:32] she came up and confessed
[1:17:34] thy faith has made you whole now people
[1:17:37] want to make other things out of it or
[1:17:39] turn it into something else but that's
[1:17:41] just how simple it really is
[1:17:43] a lot of times people's lives aren't to
[1:17:46] the place to receive that right amen the
[1:17:49] condemnation that they feel from their
[1:17:51] lives not lining up with the word that's
[1:17:54] the problem
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:56] but god must be first god will be first
[1:17:59] yeah saint luke i got several scripture
[1:18:01] i want to read
[1:18:06] but let's go to saint luke chapter 7 now
[1:18:10] so keep your bibles handy i do have
[1:18:12] several scriptures i want to read
[1:18:16] i always give you time uh try to give
[1:18:18] you time to look them up but you can see
[1:18:21] i always
[1:18:23] to be a little more efficient i always
[1:18:24] put a tab where i'm going to a scripture
[1:18:27] i always do lie them down first second
[1:18:29] third fourth course of god changes it
[1:18:30] sometimes but that's that's what so i go
[1:18:33] to it fairly quickly so you can see the
[1:18:35] blue tabs i have i have several
[1:18:36] scriptures that i want to refer to today
[1:18:39] but
[1:18:40] don't intend to be
[1:18:42] uh too lengthy of course like last week
[1:18:44] but um
[1:18:46] but i want to try to go through this the
[1:18:47] best again st luke chapter seven now
[1:18:50] let's look at this other aspect of
[1:18:52] faith saint luke chapter 7 verse 44
[1:18:58] and he turned to the woman
[1:19:02] and said
[1:19:04] and said unto simon
[1:19:06] seest thou this woman now we we know the
[1:19:09] story of course
[1:19:10] uh
[1:19:11] where she came in and she had the
[1:19:13] ointment and she cried and she dried
[1:19:16] her his feet she washed his feet with
[1:19:19] her tears and dried up with her hair and
[1:19:21] anointed and
[1:19:22] the the oil anointed jesus
[1:19:25] and and basically was a rebuke to simon
[1:19:28] simon was the one that had invited him
[1:19:31] but he didn't make him feel welcome this
[1:19:32] woman came in who was ill-reputed made
[1:19:34] him feel welcome who is the greater
[1:19:36] blessing
[1:19:39] but he turned to her and said unto simon
[1:19:42] seest thou this woman
[1:19:44] i entered into your house thine house
[1:19:47] thou gavest me no water for my feet but
[1:19:50] she hath washed my feet with tears and
[1:19:53] wiped them with the hairs of her head
[1:19:55] though gave us me no kiss but this woman
[1:19:58] since the time i came in had not ceased
[1:20:01] to kiss my
[1:20:02] feet my head with oil thou diss not
[1:20:06] anoint but this woman hath anointed my
[1:20:09] feet with ointment
[1:20:11] wherefore i say unto thee her sins which
[1:20:14] are many are forgiven
[1:20:16] for she loved much but to whom little is
[1:20:18] given the same loveth little
[1:20:22] and he said unto her
[1:20:24] thy sins are forgiven
[1:20:27] praise the lord thy sins are forgiven
[1:20:31] they said and then that said it meet
[1:20:32] with him began to say within themselves
[1:20:35] who is this that forgive his sins also
[1:20:38] so he heals
[1:20:40] and he saves
[1:20:42] and he said to the woman
[1:20:44] thy faith has saved thee
[1:20:47] go in peace how was she saved by her
[1:20:50] faith
[1:20:51] her faith compelled her to do what she
[1:20:54] did to jesus
[1:20:56] her faith compelled her to come in and
[1:20:58] wash his feet and to anoint him and to
[1:21:01] kiss his feet and to make him feel
[1:21:03] welcomed and loved like she did
[1:21:06] how many times does jesus come into a
[1:21:08] church service and he's forgotten about
[1:21:11] right right or he's left out
[1:21:13] or he's not made welcome
[1:21:16] people sing and shout and scream and do
[1:21:18] all kind of things that but god doesn't
[1:21:20] inhabit just any worship saints he
[1:21:22] inhabits the worship of his people
[1:21:25] he inhabits the worship that come from
[1:21:27] your heart not just because you could
[1:21:29] scream shout play a piano sing like an
[1:21:31] angel whatever it is
[1:21:32] that doesn't draw god on the scene it's
[1:21:34] your faith that draws god on the scene
[1:21:37] it's your faith that brought jesus here
[1:21:39] today it's your faith that contacts him
[1:21:42] and touches him right now for whatever
[1:21:44] you have need of your home god will
[1:21:46] contact you touch your hospital hospice
[1:21:49] wherever you are
[1:21:50] you reach out that faith is what touches
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:54] nothing
[1:21:55] all the other foundries and stuff and
[1:21:57] and they're singing and shouting and
[1:21:59] praising and jesus is still sitting over
[1:22:01] in the corner
[1:22:03] with dirty feet unwelcome
[1:22:06] he was invited there oh you know brother
[1:22:07] graham said oh if i could have just been
[1:22:09] that courier
[1:22:10] if i could if i could have just been the
[1:22:12] courier that was assigned to go tell
[1:22:14] jesus that he was invited to go to
[1:22:16] simon's house for dinner if i could have
[1:22:18] just been that courier it had been a
[1:22:20] whole lot more than an invitation
[1:22:22] delivered he said i probably wouldn't
[1:22:23] even forgot to give the invitation
[1:22:25] amen
[1:22:26] praise the lord one of the courier when
[1:22:28] said here this is for you and took off
[1:22:30] he said oh my if i could have just been
[1:22:32] that fellow but you know he got there
[1:22:35] feet washed
[1:22:36] wasn't kissed wasn't welcome there's
[1:22:38] nothing about the welcome but she did
[1:22:40] all of that her faith it's what brought
[1:22:43] and jesus acknowledged so it's not just
[1:22:46] that faith that that healed the woman
[1:22:49] with the blood in you that faith is what
[1:22:52] saved this sin riddled woman this woman
[1:22:54] of ill repute this uh a ill-fated woman
[1:22:59] was healed though her sins were many was
[1:23:02] saved
[1:23:03] because of her own faith
[1:23:06] because she believed it she didn't just
[1:23:08] believe it she received it
[1:23:10] when she received it she acted upon it
[1:23:13] the others were sitting over there
[1:23:14] eating and saying oh i believe jesus is
[1:23:16] here but what did that amount to nothing
[1:23:18] they just kept eating their dinner
[1:23:20] leaving him dirty nasty stinking over
[1:23:22] there in the corner it didn't amount
[1:23:23] anything anything to them they just kept
[1:23:25] going on about their business oh i
[1:23:26] believe jesus is here and people do the
[1:23:28] exact same thing today
[1:23:30] have any church services around this
[1:23:32] country today where jesus tried to visit
[1:23:34] on the outside
[1:23:36] not welcome
[1:23:38] maybe he's even sitting in the corner
[1:23:40] jesus with dirty feet again just waiting
[1:23:42] for some kind of
[1:23:44] acceptance
[1:23:46] some kind of faith to reach out and
[1:23:48] offer a receptive
[1:23:50] uh reception of his word
[1:23:53] to receive his word is to receive him
[1:23:56] and the only way you can receive his
[1:23:58] word is to receive it by faith
[1:24:00] and that faith is what causes uh uh uh
[1:24:04] causes to move the hand of jesus
[1:24:07] is that faith thy faith
[1:24:09] thy faith has saved thee right jesus
[1:24:12] took a chance that
[1:24:14] took a time to even give that as an
[1:24:15] example as a lesson to simon and
[1:24:18] everybody sitting there
[1:24:19] i want simon i want you and all the rest
[1:24:21] to listen up here
[1:24:23] this is how you treated me
[1:24:25] i was an invited guest and this is how
[1:24:27] you treated me
[1:24:28] i'm not in her home
[1:24:30] she didn't invite me
[1:24:32] but i've been made more welcomed by her
[1:24:34] than i have all the lot of you
[1:24:36] and all you piety and your holiness and
[1:24:39] your righteous attitudes and all you
[1:24:41] would even have this woman in your home
[1:24:43] if she hadn't come in and sprung down at
[1:24:45] my feet you wouldn't have even let her
[1:24:47] enter the door
[1:24:48] but since she's been here this is what
[1:24:50] she's done and this is what she's done
[1:24:52] this is what she's done
[1:24:54] now she's been saved
[1:24:58] been forgiven because of her faith yes
[1:25:01] she acted on our faith people a lot of
[1:25:02] times they say i have faith and there's
[1:25:04] no action right there's no act if
[1:25:07] there's no action how is there faith
[1:25:09] with no action
[1:25:11] faith is faith is not a noun faith is a
[1:25:13] verb saints there's action with faith
[1:25:17] that faith moves now obviously in the
[1:25:21] english vernacular human uh faith can be
[1:25:23] a noun but it's not a noun it's a verb
[1:25:26] it's something you do
[1:25:37] is something you act on
[1:25:38] this woman was healed because of her
[1:25:41] action of faith this woman was saved
[1:25:43] because of her action of faith
[1:25:45] reach out and touch the lord thy faith
[1:25:48] saved by thy faith amen amen
[1:25:51] you got to understand faith's not even
[1:25:53] faith especially in this world of plenty
[1:25:56] that we have today
[1:25:57] faith not even faith unless all you're
[1:25:59] holding on to is christ the word
[1:26:02] it's not even faith right if you're
[1:26:04] relying on something else or some
[1:26:06] outside source or some other entity or
[1:26:08] some that's not faith
[1:26:11] faith is the pure unadulterated belief
[1:26:13] in god in his work and what he said he
[1:26:16] would do in his word yes believing that
[1:26:19] word
[1:26:20] amen
[1:26:21] he promised to bear our burdens didn't
[1:26:23] he
[1:26:24] he promised to deliver us from all evil
[1:26:27] he promised he would never leave us or
[1:26:29] forsake us he promised that by his
[1:26:31] stripes we are healed he promised to
[1:26:34] deliver us from oppression and
[1:26:35] depression he promised all these
[1:26:38] all these gifts all these blessings that
[1:26:40] god he's promised every one of them to
[1:26:42] us
[1:26:43] he's promised to be our birthright we
[1:26:45] was talking to sister vicky friday
[1:26:48] and she she admit
[1:26:51] she'd give give the trial to the lord
[1:26:53] and then take it back and take it give
[1:26:56] it to the lord and take it back
[1:26:58] you know
[1:27:00] i've said it like this many times people
[1:27:02] come to an altar and they'll they'll
[1:27:04] they'll they'll pour their heart out to
[1:27:06] the lord and they'll give that over to
[1:27:08] the lord and you know that weight is a
[1:27:10] sin you know that sin is awake excuse me
[1:27:13] if people carry around that burden is a
[1:27:15] weight
[1:27:16] that burden is something that that you
[1:27:18] carry around with you
[1:27:19] amen a lot of people walk hunched over
[1:27:22] because of that but
[1:27:23] uh
[1:27:24] it's a weight it weighs you down right
[1:27:27] and and people come and they'll try to
[1:27:28] throw that weight off but then when they
[1:27:31] get done praying they go they go home or
[1:27:33] something and they just throw that
[1:27:34] weight back on them again
[1:27:36] he said well how did they throw it back
[1:27:38] on they threw it back on by trying to do
[1:27:40] the whole thing they just gave to god by
[1:27:42] themselves
[1:27:45] they try to take control over it they
[1:27:46] try to circumvent the will of the lord
[1:27:50] look friends sometimes the will of the
[1:27:52] lord is the hard way
[1:27:54] in fact a lot of times the will of the
[1:27:56] lord is the hard way
[1:27:58] but we don't want to take the hard way
[1:27:59] i've had people pray oh pray for my
[1:28:02] children
[1:28:03] i said well what about your children
[1:28:04] what's going on and they'll tell me i
[1:28:06] said well i've got to be honest with you
[1:28:07] i'm not going to pray blessings on your
[1:28:09] child
[1:28:11] i'm going to pray that god does whatever
[1:28:13] he has to do to get your child where
[1:28:16] they need to be with the lord amen if
[1:28:18] that's hospital if that's imprisonment
[1:28:21] if that's
[1:28:22] homeless eating out of gutters whatever
[1:28:25] god's got to do to get your whole don't
[1:28:27] don't pray like that well then don't ask
[1:28:29] me to pray
[1:28:31] because i'm not going to pray for the
[1:28:33] blessings of god of your child when all
[1:28:35] it's going to do is make them a worse
[1:28:37] reprobate than they are now right i that
[1:28:40] sounds hard saints but it's the truth
[1:28:42] yes amen how many of us coming to the
[1:28:45] lord came on a flowery bed of ease
[1:28:49] this birth is a hard birth it's a hard
[1:28:51] life but god blesses us in it
[1:28:54] amen praise the lord
[1:28:56] god blesses us in it but the blessings
[1:28:59] the lessons of god so many times they're
[1:29:01] hard it's a hard way it's a hard road
[1:29:03] that we
[1:29:04] uh that we chose to take
[1:29:07] and i tell and that that's just the way
[1:29:09] it is
[1:29:10] don't ask me to pray for them if you
[1:29:12] don't want me to pray for god's will and
[1:29:15] for whatever needs to be done to get
[1:29:17] them to the lord i said isn't the end
[1:29:19] result of your child being saved what
[1:29:21] you really want
[1:29:24] am i giving somebody everything has
[1:29:26] never helped a single person right never
[1:29:30] never will
[1:29:32] what is it get uh
[1:29:34] uh
[1:29:35] get him a fish and they got a meal teach
[1:29:37] them how to fish and they
[1:29:38] got a meal for life
[1:29:41] nobody's ever benefited from being given
[1:29:43] everything their whole life nobody right
[1:29:46] that's why you see
[1:29:47] the tradition that kind of goes where
[1:29:49] the rich people the kids are always
[1:29:51] spoiled brats yes because they get given
[1:29:53] everything all the time you can't just
[1:29:55] give to them
[1:29:57] their lives sometimes have got to go
[1:29:59] into the doldrums of of
[1:30:02] of life
[1:30:03] the hardness of life to get them up
[1:30:05] where they need to be in the lord
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:09] and that that's just and isn't that not
[1:30:11] what you really want
[1:30:14] don't you want your children say won't
[1:30:15] you want your family safe don't you want
[1:30:17] your family with the lord serving god
[1:30:20] don't you want to see them on the other
[1:30:21] side spend eternity together then
[1:30:24] don't you want to happen whatever needs
[1:30:26] to happen to them to get them to that
[1:30:28] point yes
[1:30:31] amen
[1:30:32] and
[1:30:33] i get that as a story friend but i've
[1:30:35] actually literally had people do that to
[1:30:37] me
[1:30:38] well then don't pray don't worry i won't
[1:30:42] amen unless god puts them on my heart of
[1:30:44] course if the lord puts somebody in my
[1:30:45] heart i'm going to pray for them i don't
[1:30:46] care what anybody else says
[1:30:48] but that's just the fact
[1:30:50] i don't i don't want them to just be
[1:30:53] i want their lives
[1:30:55] with the lord i want to born again
[1:30:57] filled with the spirit i want to see
[1:30:58] them in heaven i want to spend eternity
[1:31:00] with him
[1:31:02] and sometimes
[1:31:03] most of the time not all the time it
[1:31:06] comes the hard way it's not it's not the
[1:31:08] easy way
[1:31:09] holding on to christ that
[1:31:11] holding on to something you can't see
[1:31:15] it is is not an easy thing
[1:31:17] humanity and our human are human senses
[1:31:21] ct's fill smell here and imagination
[1:31:23] constant reason affection those things
[1:31:25] that are in our body our spirit
[1:31:28] they're not meant to trust or rely on
[1:31:31] things that you can't see
[1:31:33] our bodies aren't aren't built to trust
[1:31:36] in something or have faith confidence in
[1:31:38] something you can't tangibly hold
[1:31:42] or you can't see visibly
[1:31:44] or you can't feel
[1:31:46] we're not our human bodies aren't built
[1:31:48] that way
[1:31:49] amen they're not built for that so when
[1:31:52] you overcome this flesh
[1:31:55] to believe and have a faith in something
[1:31:57] or someone that you cannot see
[1:32:00] that you cannot touch that you cannot
[1:32:03] hold that you cannot taste it's hard to
[1:32:05] do it grace against every bit of our
[1:32:08] human emotion that there is our human
[1:32:11] being it goes against everything
[1:32:14] that we're that we learn as human beings
[1:32:17] yes we learn everything of what you can
[1:32:19] see or what you can hear or what you can
[1:32:21] taste or feel that's how we learn
[1:32:23] everything so then when you get older
[1:32:26] and become a christian and and you and
[1:32:28] you have to overcome this flesh
[1:32:32] with a faith that believes in something
[1:32:34] you can't see
[1:32:36] that's hard to do
[1:32:39] that's why brother branham
[1:32:41] would tell the girls sit there and you
[1:32:42] can see god manifesting and people being
[1:32:45] healed and the things going on and
[1:32:47] that'll help build your faith because
[1:32:49] see then it's something you can see
[1:32:52] but but to have a faith
[1:32:54] a a complete reliance of our lives of a
[1:32:57] faith in something you can't even see
[1:33:01] that that goes against every bit of our
[1:33:02] our humanity that's why we have to
[1:33:04] overcome the flesh
[1:33:06] and get past the flesh that's the only
[1:33:08] that faith is the only thing that can
[1:33:10] bring us beyond our humanity so that we
[1:33:13] can get to holding on to christ the word
[1:33:15] and him alone
[1:33:17] amen him only
[1:33:20] other people that were there when he was
[1:33:21] in a corporal body they could see him
[1:33:23] they could touch him they could hear him
[1:33:25] but
[1:33:26] how many people actually truly believed
[1:33:30] to receiving christ's message
[1:33:33] how many disciples did he have
[1:33:35] 12 one was the devil
[1:33:38] how many people around there believed it
[1:33:41] there were way more people that believed
[1:33:42] the message coming out of peter and paul
[1:33:44] and the
[1:33:45] philip the disciples than there was when
[1:33:47] jesus was here
[1:33:49] just think about that
[1:33:51] how many people how many people i mean
[1:33:55] there's probably
[1:33:57] now look around there's only one person
[1:33:58] in this room i know that knew brother
[1:34:00] branham brother pat
[1:34:02] how many people of that day
[1:34:05] would you imagine actually believed or
[1:34:07] received what that messenger was
[1:34:09] preaching
[1:34:10] that message
[1:34:12] that word that came forth
[1:34:14] a lot of them i believe were blinded
[1:34:16] just because of the man they were
[1:34:18] blinded of christ because of the man and
[1:34:20] all the things that he was doing all the
[1:34:22] things that was happening through him he
[1:34:24] wasn't doing them god was doing him
[1:34:25] through him but people would get so
[1:34:27] confused about that and then look at
[1:34:29] brother branham and see brother batman
[1:34:31] to the point that 50 years later people
[1:34:33] oh just brother branham were here
[1:34:36] where is your faith
[1:34:38] how many people actually then believe
[1:34:40] brother green said this several times
[1:34:42] how many church how many message
[1:34:44] churches there were in tucson when
[1:34:46] brother green left the scene or when
[1:34:48] brother brown left the scene two he said
[1:34:50] that he knew of
[1:34:52] tucson tabernacle and mesa church
[1:34:55] i think those are the two brother green
[1:34:57] mentioned i don't know i was i was only
[1:34:59] born 10 days before brother brown passed
[1:35:01] so i don't know that's what brother
[1:35:02] green's if i remember right brother
[1:35:04] green said message church roy carpenter
[1:35:06] and tucson tavern on two one brother
[1:35:07] passed away how many are there now
[1:35:10] 100 200
[1:35:12] there's there's a couple dozen or more
[1:35:14] just in phoenix there used to be 14 15
[1:35:17] here in tucson i don't know how many
[1:35:18] there are now
[1:35:20] home churches and people that just meet
[1:35:22] together
[1:35:23] how many of flagstaff
[1:35:25] show low pine top prescott there's
[1:35:29] churches all over the place it wasn't
[1:35:30] like that when brother branham was here
[1:35:33] but why has the message done
[1:35:36] by faith
[1:35:37] to bring multitudes around the world to
[1:35:40] hear this message
[1:35:42] and believe it
[1:35:44] how many are there going to be live and
[1:35:45] remain i don't know how many since
[1:35:47] brother branham's passing have there
[1:35:48] gone this passed on that died in christ
[1:35:51] that believed this message lived this
[1:35:53] truth and had faith in it
[1:35:55] amen what a lot when jesus was here but
[1:35:58] look how that happened
[1:35:59] three
[1:36:00] three thousand souls were just added at
[1:36:03] one message 15 minute message at the day
[1:36:06] of pentecost
[1:36:08] in the upper room that was 3 000 souls
[1:36:11] added that day
[1:36:14] there weren't that many when jesus
[1:36:16] when jesus is standing in the flesh
[1:36:20] it just goes to show saints my whole
[1:36:22] point
[1:36:23] is it's faith in christ the word
[1:36:26] not not in a person
[1:36:28] not an intangible individual this work
[1:36:32] is not a work of humanity it's a work of
[1:36:35] the spirit
[1:36:36] and the spirit of god that's when each
[1:36:39] every one of us says that by the moving
[1:36:41] of the faith that's in your life is what
[1:36:43] produces the results
[1:36:45] that's what brings the results it's the
[1:36:48] faith that does it let my faith move the
[1:36:51] hand of god
[1:36:53] praise the lord
[1:36:55] i think so many times we get confused
[1:36:57] too
[1:36:59] the will of well we want the will of god
[1:37:01] yes we do and i don't mean to confuse
[1:37:03] that or conflate that with with faith i
[1:37:06] don't i don't mean that people i want
[1:37:08] the will of god well you know i believe
[1:37:11] that god will help you to understand and
[1:37:12] know what the will of god is
[1:37:15] especially if it's something that's dear
[1:37:17] and close to you
[1:37:18] i told you the story about my sister
[1:37:20] several times
[1:37:22] i prayed for my sister to be healed i
[1:37:24] prayed for her healing i believed for
[1:37:25] her healing i trusted god for her
[1:37:27] healing i i i prayed and believed to the
[1:37:30] point that i knew my sister was going to
[1:37:33] be well
[1:37:34] but then that one night coming across
[1:37:36] interstate 40 from flag to show low
[1:37:39] the lord told me to stop praying for her
[1:37:42] and i found out why the lord told me why
[1:37:46] that a
[1:37:48] unto me according to your will lord i
[1:37:49] quit praying for her to be healed and
[1:37:51] god took her home amen is that simple
[1:37:54] yeah will you know the will of the lord
[1:37:55] god will show it to you you're a child
[1:37:57] of god saint
[1:37:58] god loves you
[1:38:00] god god's not just he's not some
[1:38:02] sinister god over the corner just saying
[1:38:04] oh just just wait for that person to
[1:38:07] really have faith and i'll strike them
[1:38:08] down god's not he's not that kind of god
[1:38:12] he's a loving merciful kind god he loves
[1:38:14] you you're his children
[1:38:16] and and he wants you to to be a part of
[1:38:19] that he wants you to know
[1:38:21] amen brother brown god tried to warn the
[1:38:24] shakira family about sister florence and
[1:38:27] and her going on but they didn't want it
[1:38:29] they didn't want to have anything to do
[1:38:30] with that
[1:38:31] god god used the prophet to tell him
[1:38:34] it's her time to go i'm going to take
[1:38:36] her home and friend
[1:38:37] it probably everybody was there and
[1:38:39] fought about against brother brown and
[1:38:41] with us probably gone now too
[1:38:44] we're all going to come to that place
[1:38:45] eventually if the lord doesn't rapture
[1:38:47] us home
[1:38:48] we're all going to come to that place
[1:38:51] so when is it going to be by what means
[1:38:53] is it going to be that's god's choice
[1:38:55] whatever god chooses to do but i'm going
[1:38:58] to hold on to faith if god
[1:39:00] says something different then that's
[1:39:02] okay
[1:39:03] amen but
[1:39:04] according to his word
[1:39:05] by your faith
[1:39:08] you hold on to it
[1:39:09] you believe that
[1:39:11] i remember my brother was he had a
[1:39:12] stroke and was supposed to die just
[1:39:14] right then they didn't expect him to
[1:39:16] live 12 hours
[1:39:18] i went to prayer to god i said god don't
[1:39:20] you take my brother until he's ready to
[1:39:22] go
[1:39:23] i said i
[1:39:24] my brother is not going to go to hell
[1:39:26] i'm believing in faith lord you're going
[1:39:28] to do with him right now whatever you
[1:39:31] have to do don't take him before he's
[1:39:33] ready
[1:39:34] my brother lived another week
[1:39:36] before the lord took him home
[1:39:38] and i had peace in my heart
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:44] and it didn't change anything
[1:39:46] it didn't make anything any different
[1:39:48] it's just knowing who you are yes it's
[1:39:51] just standing on your own his word is
[1:39:53] standing on his promise with the faith
[1:39:54] that he gave you to use
[1:39:56] belongs to me
[1:39:58] it's my possession
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:02] you don't own a house and property and
[1:40:04] somebody comes and trespasses and and
[1:40:07] does whatever they want to to your
[1:40:08] property and you're like well you need
[1:40:10] to get off my property unless unless you
[1:40:13] know fred down the street gave you
[1:40:15] permission then you can stay well fred's
[1:40:16] got nothing to do with your property
[1:40:17] it's your property yes
[1:40:20] unless bob down the street or something
[1:40:22] unless he said it's okay
[1:40:24] uh uh well or unless somebody you just
[1:40:26] met in jail or something if it's so it's
[1:40:28] okay then you can stay it doesn't work
[1:40:30] that way it's my property
[1:40:32] it belongs to me
[1:40:34] i say who comes on there and doesn't i
[1:40:37] say what happens on their what doesn't
[1:40:40] not them not the devil me
[1:40:44] the devil doesn't say what happens in my
[1:40:46] life the devil doesn't dictate what
[1:40:47] happens in my family i do right
[1:40:51] it's my property
[1:40:52] it's my faith it's what i believe
[1:40:56] hold on to that
[1:40:58] salvation
[1:40:59] let's go to another scripture
[1:41:01] i might have to go through them rather
[1:41:03] quick now saint uh not saint james
[1:41:09] james chapter five
[1:41:16] faith saints is so much more than just
[1:41:17] saying i believe
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:21] faith is so much more than just even
[1:41:23] quoting
[1:41:24] hebrews
[1:41:25] is the substance of things hoped for the
[1:41:27] evidence of things not seen it's so much
[1:41:29] more than just that
[1:41:32] faith is the very foundation of our
[1:41:35] spiritual welfare
[1:41:38] the statue of a perfect man doesn't
[1:41:40] exist without faith
[1:41:43] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:41:45] godliness love brotherly kindness none
[1:41:47] of that exists in your life without
[1:41:49] faith
[1:41:51] people try to
[1:41:53] they try to jump in a church and just
[1:41:55] get right up there with virtue or or
[1:41:57] knowledge or something because most of
[1:41:58] the time it's knowledge everybody wants
[1:42:00] to gain knowledge in this message why
[1:42:02] does everybody want to have a bunch of
[1:42:03] knowledge in the message
[1:42:05] but they've skipped faith
[1:42:08] how can you have knowledge without the
[1:42:10] faith to believe it that it's god's word
[1:42:12] you can have head knowledge but i'm
[1:42:14] talking about the actual godly knowledge
[1:42:15] that god gives
[1:42:17] you guys you can't even get it without
[1:42:19] the faith
[1:42:20] that's got to be the foundation
[1:42:22] so everything starts with faith
[1:42:24] everything
[1:42:26] every facet of your life even the things
[1:42:28] you can see touch phil smell here every
[1:42:30] bit of us by faith now it's a different
[1:42:32] type of faith like walking in this
[1:42:34] building and flipping on the switch and
[1:42:36] the lights come on i believe when i flip
[1:42:37] the switch the lights are gonna come on
[1:42:40] and they did
[1:42:42] amen
[1:42:43] sometimes i flip the switch though and
[1:42:45] one doesn't come on or it comes on for a
[1:42:47] second goes out because the bulb goes
[1:42:49] out or something you know
[1:42:51] but it's just a different kind of faith
[1:42:52] james chapter five let's read this
[1:42:57] james 5 13 is any among you afflicted
[1:43:02] let him pray
[1:43:04] amen any afflicted
[1:43:06] any afflicted pray let him pray is he
[1:43:10] married let him sing songs
[1:43:13] is any sick among you let him call for
[1:43:15] the elders of the church and let them
[1:43:17] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[1:43:19] the name of the lord well in the name of
[1:43:21] jesus christ i believe and pray that by
[1:43:24] faith that the holy spirit is going to
[1:43:26] pour out on my brother the holy spirit
[1:43:28] is going to pour out on my sister oh you
[1:43:31] say well what is that that's the oil
[1:43:33] the holy ghost is the oil that you pour
[1:43:36] out on that person it might not be a
[1:43:39] literal bot a bottle that you put on
[1:43:41] them or something but it's your faith
[1:43:43] that sends god to that person and pours
[1:43:45] out the holy ghost on them
[1:43:48] that's the holy ghost is where the
[1:43:50] healing virtue comes from
[1:43:53] you do that by faith
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:56] let him
[1:43:57] call for the oldest of the church
[1:44:01] what have we done let them pray over him
[1:44:03] we pray
[1:44:04] anointing him with them with oil in the
[1:44:06] name of the lord they're anointed
[1:44:09] in the name of jesus by his stripes they
[1:44:11] are healed
[1:44:14] simple
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] they could come here somebody's here and
[1:44:20] want to lay hands on them and and anoint
[1:44:22] them with oil that's fine too
[1:44:24] amen but so many times you hear people
[1:44:27] and about the only equation they put to
[1:44:29] this
[1:44:30] uh is a literal interpretation well
[1:44:33] they've got to be standing here in a
[1:44:35] church you've got to come up to that
[1:44:37] person and put your hand on that person
[1:44:38] and put oil on them that's not the only
[1:44:41] interpretation of the scripture
[1:44:43] you can pray for that person and you can
[1:44:45] send the holy ghost to their bed or
[1:44:47] where they're lying and have that oil
[1:44:49] poured out all over them in the form of
[1:44:51] the holy ghost because that's where
[1:44:52] healing is anyway
[1:44:54] healing's not the bottle of olive oil
[1:44:57] healing's in your faith
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:03] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:45:06] sick
[1:45:07] heal the sick save the sick
[1:45:10] and the lord shall raise him up and if
[1:45:12] he had committed sin they shall be
[1:45:14] forgiven him now we've got james giving
[1:45:16] us an accumulation of the two stories we
[1:45:19] just read
[1:45:20] you got physical healing and you got
[1:45:23] spiritual salvation
[1:45:25] both at the hands of the believer
[1:45:28] by faith isn't that right
[1:45:31] prayer of the faith shall save the sick
[1:45:34] heal the sick
[1:45:35] and the lord will raise him up
[1:45:37] and if he's committed sin they shall be
[1:45:40] forgiven him
[1:45:41] praise the lord healing salvation
[1:45:45] where does it belong in your faith
[1:45:49] salvation belongs in my faith absolutely
[1:45:53] if it doesn't then why did jesus tell
[1:45:55] her thy faith has saved you why does it
[1:45:58] say the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:46:01] sick and forgive them of their sins
[1:46:04] where does salvation lie in your faith
[1:46:07] yes
[1:46:08] amen
[1:46:09] we say well i'm saying what about your
[1:46:11] children
[1:46:13] what about your family what about your
[1:46:15] loved ones you believe for them too yes
[1:46:18] same faith
[1:46:19] is it not brother ram said same faith
[1:46:22] that you believed your saved is the same
[1:46:24] faith you used for them why because it's
[1:46:27] the scripture
[1:46:30] salvation comes by faith yes
[1:46:33] your faith
[1:46:34] your faith in this unfailing word
[1:46:37] brought salvation to your life
[1:46:40] it'll do the same for them
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:44] your faith yes your faith
[1:46:47] why because it'll bring them to that
[1:46:49] place you say well i'm not saving them i
[1:46:52] don't say that but your faith could
[1:46:54] bring them to the point that their faith
[1:46:56] gets to that place to receive it as well
[1:47:00] amen
[1:47:02] thy faith has saved thee
[1:47:06] sin shall be forgiven them
[1:47:09] confess your faults one to another well
[1:47:12] that's a long lost thing isn't it
[1:47:14] now i want you to notice something here
[1:47:16] real quick it doesn't say confess your
[1:47:18] sin
[1:47:19] this is not a catholicism find a boost
[1:47:22] somewhere uh holy father what sins have
[1:47:25] you committed
[1:47:26] what sins will go to hail mary's and
[1:47:28] penances and whatever no no it's not
[1:47:30] that
[1:47:31] it's not that i stand there and absolve
[1:47:33] anybody of anything and say do a bunch
[1:47:36] of penance and you're okay no it doesn't
[1:47:38] work that way
[1:47:40] if you could but it does say confess
[1:47:42] your faults
[1:47:43] it does say confess brother sister i
[1:47:46] have a i i have a fault here or i have a
[1:47:49] weakness or i have a spirit that's
[1:47:51] trying to get a hold of me would you
[1:47:53] pray for me
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:55] no
[1:47:58] then then we run into the i'll tell you
[1:48:00] something if you don't tell anybody
[1:48:04] that's why people quit confessing to one
[1:48:05] another
[1:48:07] amen
[1:48:08] loose lips sing chips
[1:48:10] that's why so many people quit following
[1:48:12] this scripture and saying brother and
[1:48:15] it's not saying i have fallen into this
[1:48:17] sin it's not saying that i have
[1:48:18] committed this sin it just says there's
[1:48:20] just a devil after me i want you to pray
[1:48:22] for me just like just like the devil
[1:48:24] gets after you
[1:48:25] for a sickness
[1:48:27] the devil's trying to get on me with the
[1:48:29] sickness that's confessing
[1:48:31] and you have people pray for you
[1:48:33] it's the same thing
[1:48:35] well if the devil's trying to get on you
[1:48:36] for a sickness couldn't he get onto you
[1:48:38] for some other weakness that you may
[1:48:40] have and trust me satan has had his
[1:48:42] minions evaluating you since the moment
[1:48:45] you were born right and finding every
[1:48:48] spot every little weak place he can to
[1:48:51] try to get into your life
[1:48:53] he knows them
[1:48:55] very well
[1:48:56] and he'll do everything he can to
[1:48:58] exploit that weak spot right well
[1:49:01] there's nothing wrong with coming saying
[1:49:03] brother even if it's just
[1:49:05] to a
[1:49:07] someone you have a lot of confidence in
[1:49:08] or the past or myself whatever my wife
[1:49:12] or your friend or brother or sister
[1:49:14] whatever it is
[1:49:16] you're just saying that the devil's just
[1:49:17] trying to torment me torment with me
[1:49:19] with this
[1:49:21] would you pray for me
[1:49:23] i i i have a i have a weakness of
[1:49:25] alcohol would you would you pray for me
[1:49:28] i have a weakness with lust would you
[1:49:30] pray for me i have i had i have a
[1:49:32] weaknesses that smoke demon i gave up
[1:49:34] cigarettes 20 years ago but that smoke
[1:49:36] demon when i just get it just comes on
[1:49:39] me would you pray
[1:49:40] that's just confessing a fault that's
[1:49:42] just confessing something that you say
[1:49:44] you want god to help you with and you
[1:49:46] want other people to join in prayer
[1:49:48] together with you
[1:49:50] to overcome that to get past that
[1:49:53] amen
[1:49:55] that's the way i see it confess your
[1:49:56] faults one to another and pray one for
[1:49:59] another that ye may be healed
[1:50:01] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:50:03] righteous man availeth much now that
[1:50:06] effectual
[1:50:07] effectual means powerful and producing
[1:50:11] it's a powerfully producing
[1:50:14] prayer that aids somebody it's also to
[1:50:17] aid one
[1:50:18] to bring assistance to someone but your
[1:50:21] effectual prayer should be a powerful
[1:50:23] prayer
[1:50:24] powerful doesn't mean yelling and
[1:50:26] screaming
[1:50:27] power doesn't mean pulling or pouring a
[1:50:29] bottle of oil over somebody that's not
[1:50:31] powerful
[1:50:32] or jackal i think it was jack cole
[1:50:35] anyway used to come up and punch people
[1:50:38] in the stomach devil come out of her
[1:50:41] i think that's a powerful prayer that's
[1:50:43] not powerful power
[1:50:45] the power of a prayer comes from your
[1:50:47] faith
[1:50:48] amen it's the life behind the name that
[1:50:51] makes the demons tremble
[1:50:53] that's what a powerful prayer is
[1:50:55] you stand your ground and know who you
[1:50:57] are that powerful prayer produces
[1:51:00] something it brings results the
[1:51:02] effectual
[1:51:03] effectual just means it's hot burning
[1:51:06] passionate
[1:51:07] uh desirous
[1:51:09] you you you have a desire behind your
[1:51:12] prayer you're zealous about your prayer
[1:51:15] you're passionate about your prayer
[1:51:18] your passionate powerful prayer will
[1:51:20] bring results in one another's lives
[1:51:23] i believe a church
[1:51:26] a church that prays like that for one
[1:51:28] another
[1:51:29] not even necessarily we said we'll just
[1:51:31] forget to confess your fault
[1:51:32] but we're just praying for one another
[1:51:34] in that venue just pray for one another
[1:51:36] like this scripture says he sexually
[1:51:38] fervently
[1:51:40] passionately powerfully praying with
[1:51:42] your faith honored before the throne of
[1:51:44] god
[1:51:45] will
[1:51:47] would be a church the devil can't do
[1:51:48] nothing with right
[1:51:50] it'll be a congregation satan will come
[1:51:52] in but he won't have he won't be able to
[1:51:54] do anything to anybody he won't have a
[1:51:56] chance yeah amen
[1:51:59] because they're praying one for another
[1:52:01] right
[1:52:03] elias was a man subject to light
[1:52:06] passions as we are and prayed earnestly
[1:52:08] that it might not rain and reign not on
[1:52:10] the earth for the space of three years
[1:52:11] and six months and he prayed again the
[1:52:14] heaven gave rain the earth brought forth
[1:52:16] forth her fruit
[1:52:17] brethren if any of you do heir from the
[1:52:19] truth
[1:52:20] uh and one convert him let him know that
[1:52:23] he which covert the center from error of
[1:52:26] his way shall save a soul from death and
[1:52:28] shall hide a multitude of sins
[1:52:31] praise the lord
[1:52:32] even a man like elijah
[1:52:35] was a man subject to like passions as we
[1:52:38] are and that's another
[1:52:40] that's another curse to our faith let me
[1:52:44] read first john now uh
[1:52:47] for ten more minutes
[1:52:49] five more minutes i'll do it as quickly
[1:52:52] as possible
[1:52:55] there's there's a there's a few things
[1:52:57] that the lord gave me
[1:53:00] to understand what is the hindrances to
[1:53:03] our faith
[1:53:04] what is our faith based on
[1:53:07] see because our faith is has got to be
[1:53:09] based on something because we're still
[1:53:10] human beings we're human beings
[1:53:13] reaching into a dimension that we've
[1:53:15] never seen or felt or we know it's there
[1:53:19] but we only know it because of faith
[1:53:22] we only know it because of god in his
[1:53:24] word
[1:53:25] but it reaches into a different place to
[1:53:28] get a hold of it because it's not here
[1:53:31] understand
[1:53:32] and and that faith has got to come
[1:53:35] to that place that
[1:53:38] each facet of that and there's more than
[1:53:40] this
[1:53:41] i just got five
[1:53:44] five here
[1:53:46] of things that will hinder our faith are
[1:53:48] things that we need to accomplish and do
[1:53:50] in life
[1:53:52] uh i had this one listed differently but
[1:53:55] it goes along with elijah here first
[1:53:57] john
[1:53:58] uh first john chapter 3 verse 19 i'm
[1:54:00] just going to read
[1:54:02] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:54:04] truth and assure our hearts before him
[1:54:07] for if our heart condemn us god is
[1:54:09] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[1:54:10] things so if our heart is condemned why
[1:54:12] would our heart be condemned because
[1:54:14] we're not living right right because
[1:54:16] we're not doing what we're supposed to
[1:54:17] do which brings us to number five that i
[1:54:20] was going to say obedience
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:25] faith operates by your obedience
[1:54:28] if you're disobedient you won't have the
[1:54:30] faith to be able to to do what you want
[1:54:34] meet the challenge
[1:54:36] understand if you're if you're
[1:54:38] disobedient and you know and you're
[1:54:41] cognizant of the fact that you're living
[1:54:43] a life or doing things or something that
[1:54:46] you're not supposed to be doing in your
[1:54:48] life it's going to burden your heart
[1:54:52] and your heart will be condemned by that
[1:54:55] thing and trust me satan will make sure
[1:54:56] he lets you know how condemned you are
[1:55:00] and your heart will be condemned and you
[1:55:02] won't be able to get to the faith that
[1:55:03] you need to have to produce the results
[1:55:06] it won't work right obedience i i took
[1:55:09] uh uh luke 5 1-9 for that but i won't
[1:55:13] read that but that obedience is a part
[1:55:15] of our faith
[1:55:17] a lack of obedience will hinder our
[1:55:19] faith
[1:55:20] pure write it brother graham say full
[1:55:22] obedience to the word of god entitle you
[1:55:24] to the token
[1:55:26] amen now people say that
[1:55:29] they try to put you in their little box
[1:55:30] with that well you got to do it the way
[1:55:32] i see it or you don't have the holy
[1:55:34] ghost no no no
[1:55:35] full obedience is obeying what god's
[1:55:37] word commanded us in getting the holy
[1:55:40] ghost
[1:55:41] it's not seven virtues as some people
[1:55:44] would say it's not fulfilling every one
[1:55:47] of the statue of a perfect man in fact i
[1:55:49] don't think you can establish or
[1:55:50] accomplish the statutes of a perfect man
[1:55:52] unless you have the holy ghost right
[1:55:55] that's my contention about it
[1:55:57] but you understand without obedience
[1:56:00] your heart's condemned
[1:56:02] and
[1:56:04] and if you have faith
[1:56:07] and you're living the life you know
[1:56:08] you're supposed to there's no hindrances
[1:56:10] then your heart doesn't continue
[1:56:12] god is greater than our heart why is
[1:56:14] john saying that he's saying that
[1:56:16] because he's saying if there's something
[1:56:17] condemning you if there's something on
[1:56:19] your heart god is greater than your
[1:56:21] heart god is greater than that
[1:56:23] condemnation god is greater than that
[1:56:25] impediment get rid of it
[1:56:28] repent of it eradicate it from your life
[1:56:31] confess your fault one to another that
[1:56:34] we pray for one another
[1:56:36] now i i i'm talking about some rough
[1:56:38] stuff saints but this is just the way
[1:56:40] the scripture works and we're willing to
[1:56:42] do it or we're not right
[1:56:44] if we're not willing to do it it's not
[1:56:46] going to bring the results right
[1:56:48] that's just the fact
[1:56:51] you do it the way the bible says it will
[1:56:52] work
[1:56:54] if our heart condemn us not then have we
[1:56:57] confidence towards god
[1:56:59] then we have faith towards god
[1:57:02] if there's nothing if there's no
[1:57:03] condemnation if there's nothing lying in
[1:57:05] the way
[1:57:06] if the obedience in your life lines up
[1:57:08] with the word then you don't have to
[1:57:10] worry about it
[1:57:12] amen
[1:57:13] because you're standing on god's word
[1:57:15] god's promise you have to know the word
[1:57:17] for yourself
[1:57:19] some people see certain things certain
[1:57:21] ways some people see them the other way
[1:57:22] but it's got to come down to the full
[1:57:24] obedience in the word
[1:57:26] that entitles you to the token
[1:57:29] not a perfect life human life
[1:57:34] but the three-step process repent be
[1:57:36] baptized name the lord jesus christ for
[1:57:38] mission sin you shall receive the holy
[1:57:39] ghost those three steps must be obeyed
[1:57:42] in god's word before you can get the
[1:57:43] holy ghost
[1:57:45] that's the full obedience
[1:57:47] it entitles you to that token
[1:57:50] you understand there's
[1:57:53] there's if you're going into a room or
[1:57:55] you're going up some stairs or you're
[1:57:57] going into a store
[1:57:58] usually you've got something you're
[1:58:00] going to accomplish
[1:58:02] there's a purpose you're coming into
[1:58:03] that room for you came through that door
[1:58:05] today because you come in to have church
[1:58:07] for us to be here together and have
[1:58:09] church
[1:58:10] that's the purpose that you desire to
[1:58:11] have accomplished when you came through
[1:58:13] that door amen well when that
[1:58:16] was met
[1:58:18] that was it that was your obedience
[1:58:21] it didn't your obedience entitled you to
[1:58:23] be here today
[1:58:25] when you clicked on a button and you
[1:58:26] started streaming your obedience
[1:58:28] entitled you to that
[1:58:30] well when it's done that's it
[1:58:32] you understand some people say full
[1:58:34] obese well that means you got to be
[1:58:36] perfect no it doesn't
[1:58:38] it just means you obey the scripture
[1:58:41] that it gets you to the place of
[1:58:42] receiving the holy ghost that's all that
[1:58:44] means
[1:58:45] it brings you to the holy spirit praise
[1:58:48] the lord once you get the holy spirit
[1:58:50] then
[1:58:51] then your whole nature changes and
[1:58:54] everything about life changes you see we
[1:58:56] can't have any condemnation to have
[1:58:59] confidence and faith our heart can't
[1:59:01] condemn us right and if we're not
[1:59:03] obedient to the word
[1:59:05] there's going to be condemnation that
[1:59:07] faith's not going to be the way it's
[1:59:08] supposed to be
[1:59:09] galatians now i've said this scripture
[1:59:11] many times i think i've been having my
[1:59:14] book but a glacier galatians now 5 6
[1:59:17] says for in jesus christ neither
[1:59:19] circumcision availeth anything nor
[1:59:21] circumcision but faith which worketh by
[1:59:23] love so you can say i got all the faith
[1:59:25] in the world yeah but if you hate your
[1:59:27] brother how is that faith going to work
[1:59:29] faith come by here and yes it did i got
[1:59:31] faith i got big muscle faith but you
[1:59:33] don't have any love
[1:59:34] won't work it's like the angel lord told
[1:59:37] brother branham be sins
[1:59:39] get the people to believe faith be
[1:59:41] sincere when you pray operates by love
[1:59:44] and then people will be healed
[1:59:46] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:59:48] faith operates by love if you don't
[1:59:50] actually have the love the prayer the
[1:59:52] faith is not going to be operated like
[1:59:54] it should or even at all
[1:59:56] it's operating works by love
[1:59:59] amen that love godly love not just a
[2:00:02] filial love god's love there's a there's
[2:00:05] got to also be forgiveness
[2:00:08] faith works by forgiveness if you're
[2:00:10] unwilling to forgive someone that will
[2:00:12] condemn you
[2:00:14] that will condemn your heart is
[2:00:16] un holding back forgiveness is
[2:00:19] disobedience to god's word
[2:00:22] people think they have the right
[2:00:24] to hold something against somebody else
[2:00:27] when you absolutely do not
[2:00:30] if you have the right to hold something
[2:00:33] against somebody else i don't care who
[2:00:35] they are or what they've done to you if
[2:00:38] you have the right to hold something
[2:00:40] against somebody else that gives jesus
[2:00:42] christ the right to hold something
[2:00:44] against you
[2:00:45] right
[2:00:47] do you want that
[2:00:48] no i don't
[2:00:51] god help me
[2:00:52] i don't want to hold anything against
[2:00:53] anybody because i don't want anything
[2:00:54] held against me
[2:00:56] and if god's god enough to forgive us
[2:00:58] enough to forgive them then i can
[2:01:00] forgive them too right yes and even if
[2:01:03] he doesn't forgive them i forgive them
[2:01:05] anyway
[2:01:06] you know forgiveness is for you anyway
[2:01:08] it's not for them right well if i
[2:01:10] forgive them that gives a leg up on me
[2:01:12] no it doesn't
[2:01:13] you forgive me gives you a leg up on
[2:01:15] them
[2:01:16] it's like the bible said you're pouring
[2:01:18] coals of fire on their head
[2:01:20] amen
[2:01:21] that forgiveness gives you the upper
[2:01:23] ground it helps you to be able to have
[2:01:25] your faith because now there's no
[2:01:27] impediment
[2:01:28] there's nothing in the way
[2:01:30] there's nothing condemning you there's
[2:01:31] nothing stopping it
[2:01:33] praise the lord
[2:01:35] confidence and forgiveness and one more
[2:01:37] humility those are the five that i've
[2:01:39] got here humility
[2:01:41] you've got to be humble before the lord
[2:01:44] for that faith to operate i'll read it
[2:01:46] real quick here romans 12
[2:01:48] 3. for i say the
[2:01:51] through the grace given unto me to every
[2:01:54] man that is among you not to think
[2:01:56] listen to scripture now not to think of
[2:01:58] himself more highly than he ought to
[2:02:00] think
[2:02:01] but to think soberly according to god
[2:02:04] according as god has dealt to every man
[2:02:06] the measure of faith
[2:02:09] humility not to think about what he
[2:02:12] really is and the truth of it is i'm
[2:02:15] nothing so how could i
[2:02:16] think more than what it i'm nothing more
[2:02:19] than a child of god
[2:02:21] amen
[2:02:22] that that's who i am that's what i am
[2:02:24] but beyond that i'm nothing amen praise
[2:02:27] the lord that helps bring that faith
[2:02:30] that's how that faith will operate
[2:02:32] humility love forgiveness obedience
[2:02:37] confidence amen and and in god's word
[2:02:40] those five
[2:02:42] that the lord showed me in the scripture
[2:02:44] and then again there are so many more
[2:02:46] saints
[2:02:47] but those are the things the lord gave
[2:02:49] me one more scripture as i close here
[2:02:52] hebrews chapter 4.
[2:02:56] hebrews chapter 4 verse 12
[2:02:59] for the word of god is quick and
[2:03:01] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[2:03:04] sword piercing even to the dividing
[2:03:06] asunder of soul and spirit and as and of
[2:03:08] the joint joints and moral and as a
[2:03:11] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[2:03:13] the heart
[2:03:14] neither is there any creature that is
[2:03:16] not manifest in his sight but all things
[2:03:19] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[2:03:22] with whom we have to do
[2:03:24] seeing then that we have a great high
[2:03:26] priest that is passed into the heavens
[2:03:29] jesus is the son of god let us hold fast
[2:03:32] our profession professions are part of
[2:03:34] that faith too yes amen confession and
[2:03:36] profession
[2:03:38] we uh for we have not a high priest
[2:03:40] listen to this double negative now and
[2:03:42] turn it into the positive for we have
[2:03:45] not an high priest which cannot be
[2:03:47] touched with the feeling of our
[2:03:49] infirmities but was in all points
[2:03:52] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[2:03:54] so what he's saying is we do have a high
[2:03:57] priest that can be touched by the
[2:04:00] feeling of our infirmities amen amen
[2:04:03] touched by the feeling of our
[2:04:05] infirmities what was our title touching
