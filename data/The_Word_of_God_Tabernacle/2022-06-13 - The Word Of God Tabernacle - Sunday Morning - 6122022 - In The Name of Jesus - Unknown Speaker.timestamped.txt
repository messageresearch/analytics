[47:12] could
[47:14] amen
[47:16] i felt to ask when i was sitting there
[47:17] michael would sing if anybody had a
[47:18] testimony
[47:20] on your heart
[47:25] [Music]
[47:28] we were cutting some trees and limbs and
[47:30] things
[47:32] i set them on fire
[47:34] in our fire pit
[47:36] and i thought of something
[47:39] in the garage
[47:40] and i wanted to do so
[47:42] i stepped into the garage and i forgot i
[47:44] was burning a fire
[47:48] and there was some wood chips ground
[47:50] cover and set the ground on fire
[47:54] santa burned up her rose bushes she was
[47:56] pretty mad about that but i seen all the
[47:58] smoke coming and we had fire hoses we
[48:01] ran out there and
[48:03] doused it
[48:04] out up some roses
[48:08] nobody got hurt
[48:09] we didn't set anybody else's house on
[48:11] fire enough and so
[48:13] praise the lord
[48:16] something bad has to happen in order for
[48:17] something good to have amen yes praise
[48:20] the lord praise the lord we're okay from
[48:22] the ashes arising you beautiful roast
[48:24] wishes
[48:28] amen
[48:30] yes there you go
[48:32] amen sometimes that's the best soil when
[48:35] it's been burnt over oh yeah purify soda
[48:38] praise the lord amen but thank god even
[48:40] in our absence-mindedness sometimes he
[48:42] is always
[48:44] present
[48:46] he is always current-minded even when we
[48:49] have lapses he's still there praise the
[48:51] lord
[48:52] let's turn our bibles now to saint john
[48:54] chapter five
[48:56] i'm going to read a few verses of
[48:58] scripture here
[49:01] as you might
[49:02] probably already know the theme of the
[49:04] message today
[49:06] of course the theme of every message is
[49:08] about jesus
[49:10] medicine one in particular if you will
[49:14] i want to title it in the name of jesus
[49:17] praise the lord so but we're going to
[49:18] begin with our scripture reading in
[49:20] saint john chapter 5 verse 39
[49:24] and that's where i want to start
[49:28] i felt the lord actually i think i was
[49:30] sitting in the bogan b is when the lord
[49:31] put this on my heart
[49:33] believe it or not
[49:35] um
[49:36] he's mindful wherever we are
[49:39] but then it's just it just evolved quite
[49:43] a bit from there so
[49:44] um
[49:46] saint john chapter 5 verse 39 before we
[49:48] read the word let's just buy our heads
[49:49] for word prayers again
[49:52] lord jesus
[49:54] father god we are so very thankful again
[49:56] of your grace and mercy and for blessing
[49:58] us once again to come to your house
[50:00] expecting you to
[50:02] do again as you have so many times
[50:04] before
[50:06] your holy spirit having its preeminence
[50:08] and your word speaking to our hearts and
[50:12] you revealing through your spirit that
[50:14] word to us
[50:15] helping us to grow and to become more
[50:17] like you and
[50:18] we know faith comes by hearing hearing
[50:21] the word of god
[50:22] believing that you're speaking this word
[50:24] to us lord it'll bring faith it'll raise
[50:26] faith in our lives to believe for
[50:29] whatever we have need of today
[50:31] sometimes whereas humans god we
[50:33] relate so much to the sea tasteful smell
[50:36] here and even to our spirits of
[50:38] imagination reason affection conscience
[50:41] but lord
[50:42] it's to go beyond that that that we can
[50:45] reach to a place where you are and the
[50:48] and the blessings and the benefits and
[50:50] and all that you have for us in this
[50:52] life god can't can't be measured in what
[50:54] we see tasteful smell here but lord it's
[50:57] measured in the spirit realm that you
[50:59] drop down in our hearts it reveals and
[51:01] shows to us things that are beyond what
[51:04] we can even imagine or think
[51:06] we thank you god that we can have faith
[51:08] to believe in that and we can have faith
[51:10] to know that as you promised it in your
[51:12] word it's not upon our abilities it's
[51:14] not upon our merits it's not upon
[51:16] anything we've done it's nothing we ever
[51:18] could do lord but we just simply believe
[51:21] your word we believe what you've told us
[51:23] we believe what you've showed us we
[51:25] believe what you've done for us lord and
[51:27] what you're continuing to do and that's
[51:29] where we stand that's where we are today
[51:31] lord that's where we stand that's what
[51:33] we believe that's our absolute that's
[51:35] our type host lord that's our everything
[51:37] today but thank god thank you lord
[51:40] that's all we need
[51:41] we thank you lord jesus for being with
[51:43] us again for the songs that are sung
[51:45] lord and for the testimony for the
[51:47] spirit that we have felt thus far and
[51:49] praying again lord that you would have
[51:51] preeminence in the remaining part of
[51:52] this service we rebuke every demonic
[51:55] spirit that would try to hurt hinder or
[51:57] infiltrate this service in any way that
[51:59] you get the glory honor and praise for
[52:01] all that is said and done you speak now
[52:04] speak through these lips you hear now
[52:06] hear through our ears and to you be all
[52:08] the glory honor and praise in the name
[52:10] of the lord jesus christ we pray
[52:12] amen amen
[52:14] saint john chapter 5 we'll begin with
[52:17] verse 39
[52:19] search the scriptures
[52:21] for in them ye think ye have eternal
[52:24] life and they are they which testify of
[52:26] me
[52:27] and you will not come to me that you may
[52:30] have life i receive not honor for men
[52:33] but i know you that you have not the
[52:36] love of god in you
[52:38] i am come in my father's name and you
[52:40] receive me not if another shall come in
[52:43] his own name him you will receive
[52:47] you can be seated if you like
[52:52] i obviously want to focus on the 43rd
[52:55] verse
[52:56] the 43rd verse being that
[52:59] jesus said i am come in my father's name
[53:04] i am come in my father's name well what
[53:06] was his name
[53:08] his name was jesus why was his name
[53:10] jesus because god sent an angel to come
[53:12] to mary to tell her his name shall be
[53:15] jesus
[53:16] and the first time that name was
[53:17] mentioned in company a baby that was
[53:20] dead in the mother's womb leaked to life
[53:22] amen that name jesus
[53:25] now that jesus that we believe of course
[53:28] is beyond just a a a nominal name jesus
[53:32] because it comes with the power and
[53:34] authority of the lord jesus christ he is
[53:36] god almighty and jesus said he comes in
[53:40] his father's
[53:41] name so his father has a name and his
[53:44] name is jesus because he came in that
[53:47] name and that earthly name identified
[53:50] the flesh of god who he was to us in
[53:52] this earth amen amen the only begotten
[53:55] son of god
[53:56] but you look here and see what jesus
[53:59] identifies as and what and what it is
[54:02] today look at this
[54:03] jesus said brother man of course
[54:05] mentioned this several times but he
[54:07] jesus said search the scripture that's
[54:10] the first thing to do amen i enjoyed
[54:13] that part of course brother dennis's
[54:15] prayer when he mentioned about that
[54:17] about the searching of the scripture
[54:20] because in here lies everything we have
[54:23] everything we need to know
[54:25] god himself and letter form to us
[54:28] is in this bible this bible's not jesus
[54:30] but everything in this he is the word
[54:33] amen the word was made flesh and dwelt
[54:36] among us he's the same yesterday today
[54:37] and forever so we searched the scripture
[54:39] so in searching the scripture what does
[54:41] that call for us it calls for us to get
[54:44] into
[54:45] into christ
[54:48] being in christ searching the word it
[54:50] helps us come to a revelation of who he
[54:53] is not just a name jesus not just a an
[54:58] authoritative figure that people claim
[55:00] to worship but
[55:02] jesus himself the only begotten son of
[55:04] god god himself god almighty veiled in
[55:07] flesh the creator of heaven and earth
[55:10] who encompasses all space time and
[55:12] eternity
[55:13] jesus
[55:15] search the scriptures for in the
[55:17] scripture now
[55:19] you think now he's talking to these
[55:21] unbelievers
[55:22] pharisees or sadducees they can't
[55:24] remember
[55:25] anyway that that jesus did the miracle
[55:28] on the sabbath and and uh they hate him
[55:30] for that and then he says uh i do my
[55:33] father's work and then they hated him
[55:34] even more because to do that is to claim
[55:36] to be the father and of course uh
[55:40] he was he just came in in flesh form so
[55:43] they hated him for it and jesus is
[55:46] speaking to them and he says in there
[55:50] amen now remember history always repeats
[55:52] itself so as it was then so is it today
[55:54] amen search the scripture for in that
[55:56] scripture now you think
[55:59] you think you have eternal life which
[56:01] means that they don't
[56:03] they think they do but they don't
[56:06] you think you have eternal life and
[56:08] those are the ones listen to this
[56:10] because this is how close it gets things
[56:12] they are the ones that testify of me
[56:16] they're the ones that say oh i'm a
[56:18] christian they're the ones that name oh
[56:21] look at the name on our church it says
[56:23] christ church or something to deal with
[56:25] that in some way oh look at this we
[56:28] identify with him if you don't identify
[56:31] with the word of god with with the part
[56:33] of god that we can't identify in our
[56:35] humanity with then you can't say that
[56:38] you identify with god just calling
[56:40] yourself a christian does not make you a
[56:42] christian just going to church here and
[56:45] there does not make you a christian
[56:49] we have to come and be who he is by the
[56:52] testimony of our lives identifying with
[56:55] the word
[56:56] if it doesn't identify with the word
[56:58] then you can sell you want
[57:00] if the church doesn't identify with the
[57:02] word then you can call it whatever you
[57:04] want you can say whatever you want it to
[57:07] be
[57:07] oh this is where jesus meets well is it
[57:12] amen jesus is saying here they
[57:15] these people believe the exact same
[57:16] thing they believed that jesus was or
[57:19] god was in their meetings god was with
[57:21] them that god was acceptable with what
[57:23] they were doing but jesus come and told
[57:25] him different
[57:26] you think you have eternal life but you
[57:29] don't know the word
[57:31] if you knew the word you would know me
[57:33] because the word speaks of me
[57:35] and if you knew the word by the
[57:36] revelation of the word not by knowledge
[57:38] but by the revelation the word you would
[57:40] know who i am and who it is that speaks
[57:43] to you but because you don't you search
[57:45] the scripture because you think you have
[57:47] eternal life and those are the people
[57:51] those are the ones that testify of me
[57:55] they testified me they say oh i'm a
[57:58] christian i identify myself here i i i
[58:00] go to church i i go to a christian
[58:03] church or whatever it might be or look
[58:05] at our denomination or look at our
[58:06] church or look at our building or look
[58:08] at what we do and look at our programs
[58:10] and look what we've accomplished and
[58:12] look what we do for the hungry and for
[58:14] the sick and all those things and
[58:15] identifying yourself that way all those
[58:18] things there's nothing in the world
[58:19] wrong with them but where's god in all
[58:21] of it
[58:23] that's right
[58:24] if god's not there it doesn't make any
[58:26] difference
[58:27] they are the ones that testify of him
[58:30] they testify of him
[58:33] but where is he
[58:35] amen where is he that's going to be the
[58:37] question where is he they testify of him
[58:39] but where is he see they said now i come
[58:42] in my father's name and you don't
[58:44] receive me
[58:45] but if somebody came in his own name him
[58:47] you receive
[58:50] and that's exactly what they do today
[58:52] they receive going to a uh to some
[58:55] denomination church or some church it
[58:57] tickles their ears or some church that
[58:59] tickles their intellect or whatever it
[59:01] is or some pacification of coming to
[59:04] church and feeling okay about yourself i
[59:06] got to go to heaven i went to church on
[59:08] easter and christmas
[59:09] you know something just to pacify a
[59:11] religion a covering well how could god
[59:15] god is a merciful god well god's a
[59:17] merciful god to people until they don't
[59:19] till he does something that they don't
[59:20] like or they do something without his
[59:22] intervention there's a words god well
[59:24] you've already turned him down right
[59:27] why are you calling on him now when over
[59:30] here you don't even want him
[59:32] he said well we say we're christians but
[59:34] you don't identify yourself with his
[59:37] word and if you don't identify yourself
[59:39] with his word then you can't identify
[59:40] yourself with him
[59:42] but they come in another name what name
[59:44] do they come well we tell us
[59:46] the word tells us in revelation 7 that
[59:48] they're blasphemious names or revelation
[59:50] 17 excuse me
[59:52] blasphemous names
[59:54] they come in all kinds of other names
[59:57] and they say but we have christ in our
[59:59] church we have jesus in our church we
[1:00:01] have our name is this and we have our
[1:00:03] name as that we're identifying ourselves
[1:00:06] to the world as this but you're not
[1:00:08] identifying yourself any more then who
[1:00:11] you as a human or
[1:00:13] or we as a congregation are without
[1:00:16] jesus christ
[1:00:17] that's all we are
[1:00:19] they come in a different name but what
[1:00:21] is that name
[1:00:22] he says i come in my father's name
[1:00:25] and his name is jesus i come in my
[1:00:27] father's name you don't receive me
[1:00:29] because i come in my father's name
[1:00:32] so where is he
[1:00:33] he said well he's in our church
[1:00:36] where is he he's in our church where is
[1:00:39] he he's in our denomination he's in our
[1:00:41] school he's in our seminary he's over
[1:00:44] here he's over there where is he though
[1:00:46] well it's a very simple question with a
[1:00:48] very simple answer let's go to
[1:00:50] deuteronomy chapter 16.
[1:00:53] we'll find out exactly where he is
[1:01:00] deuteronomy chapter 16. read the first
[1:01:03] six verses
[1:01:09] amen people come in their own name well
[1:01:12] we know that that name is nothing more
[1:01:14] than the ark of the beast
[1:01:16] brother brown teaches us that a
[1:01:17] denomination that name you come in any
[1:01:19] other name it's just the mark of the
[1:01:21] beast
[1:01:22] whether it's mama or all the
[1:01:24] harlots that came after her it's still
[1:01:26] the same beast mark of the beast that's
[1:01:29] all it is
[1:01:30] in a name what name any name other than
[1:01:32] the lord jesus christ
[1:01:34] he said well we come as as christians
[1:01:36] you come as christians but you won't
[1:01:39] even identify yourself with him in your
[1:01:41] baptism
[1:01:44] and you say you're a christian but yet
[1:01:46] you'll identify yourself in baptism of
[1:01:49] father son holy ghost
[1:01:51] you want to even identify yourself with
[1:01:54] jesus christ in your baptism
[1:01:57] and you say you're a christian i'm sorry
[1:01:59] friend it doesn't work that way oh jesus
[1:02:01] said to do in the father son the holy
[1:02:02] ghost yeah he said in the name
[1:02:05] oh we know very well father is not a
[1:02:07] name
[1:02:08] son is not a name what is his name what
[1:02:11] was the father's name his name is jesus
[1:02:14] amen and he is the lord jesus christ
[1:02:18] praise the lord and won't even identify
[1:02:19] themselves but we're christians
[1:02:22] well you you come from that same
[1:02:26] place revelation 17
[1:02:28] and all these blasphemous names and what
[1:02:30] are they they're just nothing but the
[1:02:32] mark of the beast yes and that spirit
[1:02:35] now the mark of the beast is not a
[1:02:38] denomination the mark of the beast is
[1:02:40] the denominational spirit we talked
[1:02:43] about denominational spirit it's not
[1:02:45] catholic it's not presbyterian it's not
[1:02:47] method this is not pentecost it is a
[1:02:50] spirit that is behind that denomination
[1:02:53] nicolaitan spirit uh it's a spirit of
[1:02:55] the enemy
[1:02:56] and that spirit is what is the mark of
[1:02:59] the beast
[1:03:00] and people take it and don't even
[1:03:01] realize it
[1:03:02] when they take that into themselves and
[1:03:04] don't even realize it
[1:03:06] amen but now look where
[1:03:08] where is he now
[1:03:13] in deuteronomy
[1:03:14] 16 we find it out we find out where he
[1:03:18] is
[1:03:19] but as i was reading this this yesterday
[1:03:22] this scripture which brother adam uses
[1:03:25] in god's chosen place of worship is
[1:03:27] extremely powerful
[1:03:29] uh
[1:03:31] he ready to get to this one specific
[1:03:34] point that we want to get to and it's
[1:03:36] verse 13 and verse 6. but
[1:03:39] as i read it it became that much more
[1:03:42] alive and powerful to me yesterday so
[1:03:45] i'm going to take my time with this and
[1:03:47] go through it
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] uh
[1:03:50] with the lord's help now look
[1:03:52] deuteronomy 16 1
[1:03:55] he says observe the month of abia now we
[1:03:58] know that's well no no but that's april
[1:04:01] april is a bib is the month of april
[1:04:03] observe the month of abid and keep the
[1:04:06] passover unto the lord thy god
[1:04:10] for in the month of abib the lord thy
[1:04:13] god brought thee forth out of egypt by
[1:04:16] night now look at
[1:04:18] look at
[1:04:19] the type and shadow of this old
[1:04:21] testament
[1:04:23] deuteronomy that
[1:04:25] that god is speaking to us today through
[1:04:29] if you look at he says to keep the
[1:04:31] passover
[1:04:32] unto the lord thy god or what was the
[1:04:35] passover
[1:04:36] the passover was the sacrificing of the
[1:04:40] of the paschal lamb
[1:04:42] the sacrifice of the innocent lamb
[1:04:44] that passover represented grace to them
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:49] that passover represented grace to those
[1:04:52] that would believe it and those that
[1:04:54] would get under the blood those that
[1:04:56] were behind the blood that was applied
[1:04:58] on the doorpost and lentil those
[1:05:01] people
[1:05:02] god's grace applied to
[1:05:05] so this passover that was the sacrifice
[1:05:08] of that lamb showed grace to those that
[1:05:10] would believe it
[1:05:12] and receive it
[1:05:13] now they didn't make a disgrace out of
[1:05:15] it they believed it and received it
[1:05:17] exactly how god had presented it to
[1:05:20] moses to take that blood and to do all
[1:05:23] they did had to set up the lamb and it
[1:05:25] had to be found worthy and all the
[1:05:27] things he had to go through to bring it
[1:05:28] to the point that they could sacrifice
[1:05:30] it put the blood on the doorpost and
[1:05:32] lentil
[1:05:33] those that did that with the respect
[1:05:36] and the love and the sincerity that it
[1:05:39] deserved and as they said under that
[1:05:42] blood it was grace to them
[1:05:45] because god's
[1:05:47] the the death angel passed them by he
[1:05:50] found favor with them
[1:05:52] grace in in god's eyes to those people
[1:05:55] because they stayed alive as the death
[1:05:57] angel passed through so this passover of
[1:06:00] grace unto the lord thy god
[1:06:03] in the month of abid thy lord thy god
[1:06:05] brought thee forth out of the land of
[1:06:08] egypt now what does the land of egypt
[1:06:09] represent the world right
[1:06:12] the world god by his grace
[1:06:15] that sacrifice the grace that it
[1:06:17] represents
[1:06:19] brought us
[1:06:21] in by night
[1:06:23] i don't know about you but when you
[1:06:25] reach the darkest point of your life
[1:06:27] sometime in the darkest night of your
[1:06:30] life
[1:06:31] god by his grace calls us and brings us
[1:06:35] forth out of the world
[1:06:37] praise the lord amen by his sacrifice
[1:06:41] by his grace god called us forth out of
[1:06:44] that now we as
[1:06:47] gentiles
[1:06:49] had no hope had no purpose we weren't
[1:06:51] even a people
[1:06:53] but god sent his only begotten son to
[1:06:56] redeem humanity back to where it was
[1:06:59] before the fall in the garden of eden
[1:07:01] back to the place that was the
[1:07:02] perfection of god's mind
[1:07:04] and god sent that his only son jesus
[1:07:08] that identification of jesus
[1:07:11] to bridge that gap between god and man
[1:07:13] again
[1:07:14] that that blood would bring that gap and
[1:07:17] bring it back together through the grace
[1:07:19] of god and the forgiveness of sin we are
[1:07:22] able to approach the throne of god today
[1:07:25] just like adam did lift to ear
[1:07:30] praise the lord
[1:07:32] live to ear because of the sacrifice the
[1:07:35] grace that it represents to us the
[1:07:37] forgiveness of sin so that god calls us
[1:07:41] out of the world and sets us apart aside
[1:07:45] from the world and the world is all
[1:07:47] around us the turmoil of everything
[1:07:49] that's going on saints people in this
[1:07:52] country have slapped lost their minds
[1:07:55] yes
[1:07:56] absolutely every every week
[1:07:59] i hear some new things and i think how
[1:08:02] could a conscionable human be
[1:08:06] say that
[1:08:07] yeah
[1:08:10] it just blows my mind
[1:08:12] these people who've got
[1:08:14] masters and doctorates degrees
[1:08:17] make some of the most outrageously
[1:08:20] uncommonly
[1:08:22] ridiculous statements that are
[1:08:24] absolutely unfactionable and unable to
[1:08:28] be proved
[1:08:30] blows my mind
[1:08:32] and it seems to get worse every week
[1:08:35] but god has called us out of that praise
[1:08:37] the lord
[1:08:38] by the sacrifice of jesus by the grace
[1:08:41] of god through the passover god has
[1:08:44] called us forth out of the world
[1:08:46] by nine
[1:08:47] thou shalt therefore
[1:08:50] sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy
[1:08:54] god
[1:08:56] actually it was the second verse not the
[1:08:57] third so we'll get to this let me i'll
[1:08:59] read the rest of this thou shalt
[1:09:01] therefore sacrifice the passover unto
[1:09:04] the lord thy god
[1:09:05] of the flock and the herd
[1:09:08] in the place
[1:09:09] which the lord shall choose
[1:09:13] to place his name there
[1:09:15] where is he
[1:09:17] he's in the place
[1:09:18] that he chose
[1:09:21] you say is he here
[1:09:23] is he there
[1:09:24] is he in this church is he in that
[1:09:26] church is he in this domination is he in
[1:09:29] this seminary is he with this group of
[1:09:31] people he is where he place his name
[1:09:36] where he
[1:09:37] desires to place his name it's not based
[1:09:40] on where an individual decided to place
[1:09:44] a name
[1:09:45] oh this is this is god's church
[1:09:49] this we've named it as thus
[1:09:52] the pastor so and so the congregation so
[1:09:55] and so we got thousands or tens of
[1:09:57] thousands of members this is where god
[1:10:00] has placed his name the catholic church
[1:10:02] or the presbyterian church or some
[1:10:04] charismatic church or even some message
[1:10:07] he is
[1:10:09] where he says he is
[1:10:11] he is where he has chosen to place his
[1:10:16] name she understand it's not our choice
[1:10:20] it wasn't another man's choice right
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:24] it's his choice
[1:10:25] it's god's choice where god chooses to
[1:10:29] place his name is where he is
[1:10:32] it's his choosing not my choosing
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:36] no man's choosing
[1:10:38] no church no denomination a lot of
[1:10:40] people think that god is with them
[1:10:44] in fact
[1:10:46] what would be the purpose of going
[1:10:48] through the motions if it wasn't if you
[1:10:50] really didn't think why would you even
[1:10:52] go through the motions i mean i guess
[1:10:54] some people
[1:10:55] popularity money whatever out of power i
[1:10:58] don't know
[1:10:59] i i don't i don't understand all that
[1:11:01] because i i just i can't compute that
[1:11:04] um
[1:11:07] me and my wife one time we got
[1:11:09] somebody
[1:11:10] came and robbed stuff out of a storage
[1:11:12] unit that we had years and years and
[1:11:14] years ago in north carolina
[1:11:16] and
[1:11:18] i i i think about it and i thought about
[1:11:20] it and and we tried to say well how do
[1:11:22] you prevent it well
[1:11:24] you know to really prevent it
[1:11:27] you have to get in the mind of the
[1:11:28] criminal yes
[1:11:30] i just can't do that
[1:11:32] right
[1:11:33] so it was challenging to understand i
[1:11:35] mean what do you put up great walls
[1:11:36] fences uh razor wire i don't know
[1:11:39] something but you got to think like the
[1:11:41] criminal to understand how to keep him
[1:11:42] out
[1:11:43] and that's what all this cyber stuff's
[1:11:45] about today i think
[1:11:47] in fact i had a guy in the car one time
[1:11:48] and he said he was at a
[1:11:51] seminar for hacker seminar for hackers
[1:11:53] and stuff like that and he said he
[1:11:54] worked for the government i said well
[1:11:56] why are you doing this this he said
[1:11:57] because we have to know this to
[1:11:59] understand what they're doing
[1:12:01] the only way we can keep them from doing
[1:12:03] it is to know and understand how they do
[1:12:05] it and where they might go next and what
[1:12:08] might be their next target the only way
[1:12:10] to prevent it is to get into their minds
[1:12:12] yeah and i thought man
[1:12:15] and i and you think about that i
[1:12:17] i can't think like that
[1:12:20] so to think like
[1:12:23] how some people think what maybe
[1:12:26] a church or a minister or whatever i if
[1:12:29] you're doing it without believing that
[1:12:31] you're doing it in the truth of god's
[1:12:33] word by the spirit of god going to
[1:12:35] heaven and living for god if it is not
[1:12:38] that i just don't understand why they
[1:12:39] would even do it but you got to think
[1:12:41] like them and i can't do that so
[1:12:43] i'll just pass on that but
[1:12:46] where he is is where he chooses am
[1:12:49] it's not what i choose
[1:12:51] amen i would have never started this if
[1:12:53] i didn't feel the lord told me to right
[1:12:56] i would this is his work not mine
[1:12:59] amen this is his work he's put it in
[1:13:02] caretaker of our hands as caretakers as
[1:13:05] stewards of it but it's his work so
[1:13:08] if it's his work then it's up to him to
[1:13:10] to do with it as he pleases but it's not
[1:13:13] our choice it's not a man's choice it's
[1:13:16] not a denomination's choice it's not a
[1:13:18] it it's not tucson tabernacle brown
[1:13:21] tabernacle's not their choice it's god's
[1:13:23] choice where he is
[1:13:25] and he is where he chooses to be
[1:13:28] where he places his name is his choice
[1:13:32] not mine
[1:13:33] no matter what you call your church or
[1:13:35] whatever it might be it's his choice so
[1:13:38] now look in this place that god chooses
[1:13:42] it's his choice that that as you can see
[1:13:44] brother branham got from god's chosen
[1:13:46] place of worship right you see where he
[1:13:48] gets that now so in that that god has
[1:13:52] chosen that
[1:13:53] where he has chosen
[1:13:56] look what it says thou shalt we
[1:13:58] shall offer sacrifice
[1:14:02] the passover unto the lord thy god in
[1:14:05] that place
[1:14:08] we are to offer those
[1:14:10] sacrifices in that place of god's
[1:14:13] choosing
[1:14:14] now look first peter chapter two
[1:14:17] first peter chapter two four and five to
[1:14:20] whom coming
[1:14:21] as unto a living stone
[1:14:23] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:14:26] god and precious we know that of course
[1:14:28] that's jesus
[1:14:30] ye also now us
[1:14:32] we are lively stones
[1:14:35] built up a spiritual house
[1:14:38] a holy priesthood
[1:14:40] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:14:44] were these spiritual sacrifices to be
[1:14:47] offered they're supposed to be offered
[1:14:50] in the place of his choosing
[1:14:53] amen not just anywhere not a ball game
[1:14:56] or or a theater or something it's
[1:14:58] supposed these spiritual sacrifices that
[1:15:01] we have done this morning are to be in
[1:15:04] the place where he chooses to be
[1:15:08] praise the lord amen that's our
[1:15:10] spiritual sacrifice to him not the
[1:15:12] sleeping and throat of a lamb or bulls
[1:15:14] goats we that's not the gentile way
[1:15:18] our way is we all from spiritual
[1:15:20] sacrifices unto the lord
[1:15:23] acceptable
[1:15:24] to god by jesus christ how is it by
[1:15:27] jesus because it's in the place that he
[1:15:29] chose yes in his choosing
[1:15:33] ninth verse but ye are amen he's talking
[1:15:36] to us again now
[1:15:39] ye are a chosen generation
[1:15:42] a royal priesthood
[1:15:46] a holy nation a peculiar people amen now
[1:15:51] that makes me think about that story
[1:15:52] brother man i'm told about the old slave
[1:15:55] and people in the world think well you
[1:15:57] know
[1:15:58] i'm a christian too look at me
[1:16:02] but you just
[1:16:03] you look like all the rest of the slaves
[1:16:06] well yeah but i i'm a christian i'm a
[1:16:09] godly person you are
[1:16:11] when you look like all the rest of the
[1:16:13] slaves see remember when the slave buyer
[1:16:16] come to buy this slave he came up to the
[1:16:18] owner and said now what's with this guy
[1:16:21] i want to buy him well he's not for sale
[1:16:24] why did he want him because he carried
[1:16:26] himself different
[1:16:28] because he acted different because he
[1:16:30] looked different because he talked
[1:16:32] different because he walked and he
[1:16:34] talked and he had his shoulders through
[1:16:36] back and his head up
[1:16:39] that's the kind of band that he wanted
[1:16:41] not for sale so what makes him so
[1:16:44] different do you treat him different you
[1:16:46] do this different does he eat in a
[1:16:47] different food or something nope nope
[1:16:49] stays in the same quarters eats the same
[1:16:51] food lives the same lives does the same
[1:16:54] chores what makes him different well i
[1:16:55] wondered that
[1:16:57] he said i got to check it and found out
[1:16:59] that back home where he came from his
[1:17:01] daddy is a king
[1:17:04] that makes him a prince
[1:17:06] and because he was a prince of the king
[1:17:08] he acted like it
[1:17:11] he dressed like it he talked like it to
[1:17:14] where everybody else even a stranger
[1:17:17] come and can see there was something
[1:17:18] different about him

[1:17:29] it you sure don't talk like it
[1:17:32] and you say you're a son of the king
[1:17:34] a son of the king would be acting like
[1:17:37] the king
[1:17:38] he would be walking and talking and
[1:17:40] acting with dignity and respect amen
[1:17:43] toward everybody around him would know
[1:17:46] there's something different about him

[1:20:37] name that's where he is where he chose
[1:20:40] to place his name
[1:20:41] i trust and believe that this is a place
[1:20:44] that god has chosen yes i mean times he
[1:20:46] visit us too especially lately oh my god
[1:20:50] god chooses to place his name here and
[1:20:53] we're here under that auspice and we're
[1:20:55] here to shine forth that light we're
[1:20:57] here to reflect jesus christ
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:01] a lot of people think he's with them oh
[1:21:04] so did cain
[1:21:06] a cain thought he would cain thought he
[1:21:07] was with him too
[1:21:09] oh sure he did it's the exact same thing
[1:21:11] all the way back to
[1:21:12] cain and abel
[1:21:14] came brother branham tells cain built
[1:21:16] the altar he uh everything he did was
[1:21:19] exactly right it was it was all
[1:21:21] religious it was all according to the
[1:21:23] plan it was all according to exactly all
[1:21:25] except for one thing and that was the
[1:21:28] sacrifice
[1:21:31] the sacrifice is what made the
[1:21:32] difference
[1:21:33] he thought that uh plants a
[1:21:36] botany life would be would would be
[1:21:38] acceptable to god as a sacrifice
[1:21:42] but abel by revelation
[1:21:45] by faith by revelation knew what it took
[1:21:50] to offer the proper sacrifice and that's
[1:21:52] what the difference was cain thought he
[1:21:54] was because then it came
[1:21:56] look we'll go back to that part people
[1:22:00] with people that jesus was referencing
[1:22:03] they are they that testified me they're
[1:22:05] testifying of me and they're the ones
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:08] say they have eternal life but don't
[1:22:10] they're testifying to be that they do
[1:22:12] and you go back to cain and abel
[1:22:14] now
[1:22:15] if kane
[1:22:18] and get that mindset which again i like
[1:22:20] i said i i just i can't think it's just
[1:22:23] some limitations we have
[1:22:25] and one thing i don't want to think like
[1:22:27] a criminal
[1:22:29] yeah i can't but i don't want to but
[1:22:32] think about what cain is feeling at that
[1:22:35] time
[1:22:37] if cain didn't care why would he even go
[1:22:39] through the trouble
[1:22:41] if he didn't think he was doing what was
[1:22:43] pleasing to god why would he go through
[1:22:46] all the the the uh
[1:22:48] the motion and everything he did
[1:22:51] it's like i said about churches if they
[1:22:53] don't know or if they know that this is
[1:22:56] a
[1:22:57] wrong or a farce or or a facade whatever
[1:23:01] why do they even go through the motion i
[1:23:02] don't understand i don't get that
[1:23:05] i can just only believe that
[1:23:07] their people are doing what they're
[1:23:09] doing because they believe it's right
[1:23:11] and because they believe it's acceptable
[1:23:13] about god and i'll include all
[1:23:14] christians in that acceptable and what
[1:23:16] is right to god and in their church and
[1:23:19] what their denomination teaches or
[1:23:20] whatever they that that's what they do
[1:23:22] and that's what they believe i just got
[1:23:23] to accept that i just can't believe that
[1:23:26] people are doing it just as a facade
[1:23:28] just as a put on
[1:23:31] just to try to make look good maybe some
[1:23:34] people do i don't know but
[1:23:36] you know i just gotta believe those
[1:23:38] people are sincere they're just
[1:23:39] sincerely wrong
[1:23:41] i believe cain was sincere he was just
[1:23:43] sincerely wrong
[1:23:45] that's why
[1:23:47] when god
[1:23:48] not he went through all the all the uh
[1:23:51] trouble of doing everything he did
[1:23:54] but when god rejected his sacrifice
[1:23:57] that's why cain's countenance failed
[1:23:59] that's why cain got so mad
[1:24:01] and was disappointed
[1:24:03] because he felt like he was right
[1:24:06] it's like brother branham talked about
[1:24:08] the
[1:24:09] the disappointments in heaven
[1:24:11] the the
[1:24:12] the street walker the drunken or
[1:24:13] whatever they're not going to be
[1:24:15] surprised it's the person that's the
[1:24:16] religious one that thinks that they're
[1:24:18] right with god and god says you are the
[1:24:20] one that's testifying of me but you do
[1:24:23] not have eternal life they're the ones
[1:24:25] that's going to be disappointed right
[1:24:27] they're the ones that's going to be
[1:24:28] surprised king was genuinely according
[1:24:31] to the scripture surprised that god
[1:24:33] rejected his sacrifice
[1:24:36] because his countenance failed he got
[1:24:38] mad
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:42] in life when you're expecting something
[1:24:44] and that thing happens it's like okay
[1:24:48] but when an unexpected thing happens and
[1:24:51] it comes to life you're like wow
[1:24:53] that's amazing or something is a
[1:24:56] different reaction
[1:24:58] he was expecting one reaction he got
[1:25:00] another
[1:25:01] so he didn't get what he was expecting
[1:25:02] so his countenance failed he got mad he
[1:25:04] got upset
[1:25:06] because he thought what he was doing was
[1:25:07] right but it wasn't he thought god was
[1:25:10] with him but he wasn't right
[1:25:14] how many people on that day
[1:25:16] are going to get to that place
[1:25:18] and god's going to
[1:25:22] i hate to say it
[1:25:24] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:25:26] i never knew you
[1:25:28] hmm
[1:25:29] it's gonna be top saints yes
[1:25:31] but the place where jesus is
[1:25:34] is the place he chooses to be
[1:25:37] amen he chooses let's go on
[1:25:41] third verse thou shall eat now look that
[1:25:45] that sacrifice has been offered the
[1:25:48] spiritual sacrifices the praises to god
[1:25:50] god is accepted it's in the place of his
[1:25:53] choosing now
[1:25:54] thou shall not eat no un no leavened
[1:25:59] bread with it
[1:26:00] no leavened bread thou shalt not partake
[1:26:03] of what is leaven
[1:26:05] sin
[1:26:06] unbelief thou shalt not partake of any
[1:26:09] sin
[1:26:10] okay thou shalt not partake of any sin
[1:26:13] no leaven don't eat any leather bread
[1:26:16] with it
[1:26:16] seven days
[1:26:18] shalt thou eat unleavened bread
[1:26:20] therewith even the bread of affliction
[1:26:23] for thou camest forth out of the land of
[1:26:25] egypt in haste
[1:26:27] that thou mayest remember the day when
[1:26:29] thou camest forth out of the land of
[1:26:31] egypt all the days of thy life
[1:26:33] do not partake of sin now look what he's
[1:26:36] saying
[1:26:38] thou shalt not eat leavened bread with
[1:26:41] it seven days
[1:26:43] now when the past when the passover lamb
[1:26:46] when when the
[1:26:48] the the ultimate sacrifice jesus christ
[1:26:51] came
[1:26:53] and he gave us life
[1:26:55] and he substituted the the type and
[1:26:58] shadow of that they were in egypt with
[1:27:00] moses the paschal lamb the passover lamb
[1:27:03] and he perfected that passover he
[1:27:06] perfected that paschal lamb because he
[1:27:09] was the ultimate god in flesh sacrifice
[1:27:14] now we are not to partake of any sin
[1:27:18] for seven days that seven days
[1:27:20] represents seven church ages from the
[1:27:23] time that jesus offered the sacrifice to
[1:27:27] today
[1:27:28] there will be no sin reckoned to you
[1:27:32] why because of god's grace
[1:27:35] because of the mercy of god
[1:27:37] those whom god has chosen and those
[1:27:41] places where god has chosen to place his
[1:27:44] name
[1:27:45] there will be no leaven
[1:27:47] because what does she do
[1:27:50] father forgive them
[1:27:52] and she says lord forgive me
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:57] forgive my sin forgive my unbelief every
[1:28:00] day
[1:28:01] lord forgive my sin forgive my belief
[1:28:03] forgive my sins iniquities wrongdoings
[1:28:06] lord forgive them hide them under the
[1:28:08] blood annihilate them with the blood put
[1:28:10] them back on the head of satan or
[1:28:11] they'll lay to the day of judgment but
[1:28:13] they won't be accounted to me
[1:28:16] they won't be accounted to you
[1:28:18] no leaven
[1:28:19] no sin why
[1:28:21] not because of me because i'm a sin
[1:28:23] being to begin with this flesh
[1:28:25] is a sin being to begin with but there's
[1:28:28] no sin why
[1:28:30] because of the passover because of the
[1:28:32] sacrifice because of the blood that came
[1:28:35] forth from the sacrifice and the life
[1:28:37] that came from that sacrifice onto the
[1:28:39] worshiper
[1:28:41] now the grace of god reigns true
[1:28:44] again not the disgrace but the grace of
[1:28:47] god amen i don't want to take that blood
[1:28:50] and just trample over and do whatever we
[1:28:51] want to and say oh god forgive me let's
[1:28:54] say so many hail marys and novenas and
[1:28:56] whatever they are and
[1:28:57] pay out of purgatory and whatever they
[1:28:59] don't know what that is
[1:29:01] but
[1:29:02] the grace of god
[1:29:04] that meets the worshiper
[1:29:06] who is a holy nation
[1:29:09] who is a royal priesthood
[1:29:11] amen a peculiar people
[1:29:14] that the blood of christ that life has
[1:29:17] annihilated note
[1:29:19] from
[1:29:20] from the time of the sacrifice till
[1:29:23] today
[1:29:24] now people want to do away with it
[1:29:26] friend but it's still there today people
[1:29:28] want to take the blood off the mercy
[1:29:29] seat friend the blood is off the mercy
[1:29:31] seat brother ram said god won't even
[1:29:33] hear your prayer
[1:29:36] oh my leave it there
[1:29:38] praise god i
[1:29:41] i don't i don't claim to know it all i
[1:29:43] don't claim to uh uh be able to explain
[1:29:46] it all but i can tell you i believe it
[1:29:48] all
[1:29:49] amen and unfortunately sometimes people
[1:29:52] who seem to think they know it all will
[1:29:54] try to tell other people what they think
[1:29:56] that doesn't match up with the scripture
[1:29:58] right
[1:29:59] the message right
[1:30:01] but i believe it and i believe it to be
[1:30:03] true but from that time you see that now
[1:30:06] from that time god has called us out of
[1:30:08] the world in the time of that sacrifice
[1:30:10] for the seven days the seven church ages
[1:30:12] no sin no sin where to hurt to him that
[1:30:14] believes
[1:30:16] to the christian to the believer to the
[1:30:18] true christian i should say to the one
[1:30:20] that actually
[1:30:22] has been born again and lives by the
[1:30:24] dictates that that holy nation
[1:30:26] that royal priesthood
[1:30:28] those are the ones that god's that's the
[1:30:31] that was the
[1:30:33] the attributes in god's mind from before
[1:30:35] the foundation of the world right those
[1:30:37] are the ones who were part of him before
[1:30:39] there ever was a beginning of time
[1:30:41] life being anything else
[1:30:44] from that time now this sacrifice
[1:30:47] no leaven seven days neither shall it be
[1:30:50] any flesh
[1:30:51] which thou sacrifices look now
[1:30:55] no leaven bread forth first we're out of
[1:30:57] now
[1:30:58] no leavened bread seen with thee and all
[1:31:01] thy coast seven days
[1:31:02] neither shall there
[1:31:05] anything of the flesh
[1:31:07] amen which thou sacrifices
[1:31:10] the first day and even
[1:31:12] remain all night until the morning thou
[1:31:16] mayest not sacrifice the passover within
[1:31:19] any of thy gates
[1:31:23] amen
[1:31:25] not you
[1:31:27] not your choosing
[1:31:29] not your determination
[1:31:31] his
[1:31:32] gods
[1:31:33] it's god's choosing
[1:31:35] i can't tell you friend how many places
[1:31:38] that one when the lord put it on my
[1:31:40] heart start this church places that may
[1:31:44] have worked to have to start a
[1:31:46] congregation to start a church
[1:31:49] but this one place
[1:31:51] that god put it all together
[1:31:54] i had saw it somewhere maybe craigslist
[1:31:56] i can't remember and
[1:31:59] me and my wife were out and
[1:32:01] were just looking around
[1:32:03] and i told her i said you know what i
[1:32:05] think i'm just going to go over there
[1:32:07] and it was during the middle of the day
[1:32:08] i didn't think anybody be there
[1:32:10] i went over there door was propped open
[1:32:13] i said well there must be somebody here
[1:32:15] my wife says go in and check i said okay
[1:32:18] i'll go look see if there's anybody here
[1:32:20] i walked in the door the pastor was
[1:32:21] having a meeting with some other people
[1:32:23] i walked up he immediately left the
[1:32:25] meeting didn't didn't
[1:32:27] didn't say who are you what do you want
[1:32:28] what are you doing here he immediately
[1:32:30] left the building and came and talked to
[1:32:32] me
[1:32:34] he
[1:32:35] and forgot about he he didn't say i'll
[1:32:36] be with you in a minute
[1:32:38] he didn't say could you come back later
[1:32:39] he said here's my number call me
[1:32:42] right there
[1:32:44] he talked to me
[1:32:46] and he wanted so much money i said well

[1:32:49] don't even know if anybody's coming it
[1:32:50] just might be me and my wife

[1:32:54] less than half
[1:32:56] of what he had asked for for us to start
[1:32:58] worshiping them
[1:32:59] less than half
[1:33:01] and i thought that's just that's just
[1:33:03] the lord that's god placing all this
[1:33:05] together
[1:33:07] and bringing it to that place
[1:33:09] and something that god
[1:33:11] threw us that god could accomplish amen
[1:33:15] and then when god did this place he did
[1:33:18] basically the same thing yes
[1:33:21] and the and the owner of this the same
[1:33:23] thing
[1:33:24] so friend when it's god doing it god
[1:33:27] will make it work it's not my choosing

[1:36:43] it's the one that the lord god gives us

[1:37:10] door and just walk through it and god
[1:37:11] will take care of all the rest yes and
[1:37:13] he has
[1:37:15] praise the lord he has so you see that's
[1:37:18] the part that people say that this is
[1:37:21] what we want
[1:37:23] this is what i want
[1:37:25] i know brother branham said that that
[1:37:28] god's will falls in line with the will
[1:37:29] of the with the congregation
[1:37:32] but if there's not a god called man
[1:37:34] leading that group that listens to god
[1:37:37] friend it's so easy to get that off
[1:37:39] kilter
[1:37:40] amen it is
[1:37:42] and say well this this is what we want
[1:37:44] but it doesn't matter what you want
[1:37:47] it doesn't matter what i want
[1:37:49] it's what he wants
[1:37:50] it's it's what he desires
[1:37:53] that sacrifice
[1:37:56] thou mayest not sacrifice the passover
[1:37:59] within any of thy gates
[1:38:03] which the lord god giveth thee
[1:38:05] but at the place which the lord thy god
[1:38:08] shall choose
[1:38:10] to place his name in
[1:38:12] amen
[1:38:13] what did jesus tell them he said
[1:38:17] they'll be others come in their name
[1:38:19] you'll receive them
[1:38:21] and that's exactly what people do today
[1:38:24] they got every other name every other
[1:38:26] thing
[1:38:27] and people followed by the flocks
[1:38:30] by the birds denominations whatever they
[1:38:31] are
[1:38:33] but where is his name
[1:38:35] where is he gonna be that's what i'm
[1:38:38] concerned with
[1:38:39] not my gate not not my choosing his
[1:38:42] choosing
[1:38:43] the place the lord god shall choose
[1:38:47] there
[1:38:48] thou shalt sacrifice the passover and
[1:38:51] even at the going down of the son
[1:38:53] because you have come out of the world
[1:38:56] out of egypt sorry i don't need to
[1:38:59] change the word so much but you know
[1:39:00] what i'm saying at the season that thou
[1:39:02] comest forth out of the world
[1:39:05] out of egypt
[1:39:06] the place that god has chosen
[1:39:10] in jesus name
[1:39:12] that's the place that god has chosen
[1:39:14] what did jesus tell him as i close here
[1:39:16] matthew chapter 2 uh chapter 7 verse 21
[1:39:21] i read this scripture here a few weeks
[1:39:23] ago jesus said
[1:39:25] not everyone
[1:39:26] that saith unto me lord lord shall enter
[1:39:28] into the kingdom of heaven
[1:39:31] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:39:34] which is in heaven
[1:39:36] well how do you know what the will of
[1:39:37] the father in heaven is it's right here
[1:39:40] amen that's it
[1:39:42] you can't learn it by intellect though
[1:39:44] can't read it like a newspaper a
[1:39:46] magazine it's got to come by revelation
[1:39:49] from jesus christ the word himself
[1:39:51] and that revelation comes and then it
[1:39:53] reveals to you what it is what's
[1:39:55] pleasing to the lord
[1:39:57] if you're born again and have the holy
[1:39:59] spirit god identifies that word to that
[1:40:01] spirit to make it alive
[1:40:03] and when it becomes alive it's in you a
[1:40:06] living oracle yes amen in you the living
[1:40:10] oracle
[1:40:11] praise the lord
[1:40:13] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:40:16] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:40:19] and in thy name hath cast out devils
[1:40:23] they can even acclaim to casting out
[1:40:26] devils
[1:40:28] but jesus said and in thy name done many
[1:40:32] wonderful works but jesus
[1:40:35] well profess to them
[1:40:37] i never knew you right
[1:40:40] i never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:40:43] work iniquity you mean casting out a
[1:40:45] devil was the working of iniquity
[1:40:46] according to jesus
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:50] saints if we do anything
[1:40:52] i mean really anything outside of the
[1:40:54] word of god anything outside of the will
[1:40:56] of god in
[1:40:57] god's calling for our lives it it is not
[1:41:01] going to prosper yes it is not the will
[1:41:04] of god
[1:41:05] that's why we always try to identify the
[1:41:08] will of what is the will of god in this
[1:41:10] situation
[1:41:11] amen we we offer so many times blanket
[1:41:14] prayer requests and that's fine and we
[1:41:15] should but you know that means we need
[1:41:18] to always remember those prayer requests
[1:41:21] fall under the purview of god's word and
[1:41:23] will
[1:41:24] amen and if there's nothing else
[1:41:27] nothing else to throw a flag then you
[1:41:29] say well the word and will is for me to
[1:41:30] be well and by his stripes i'm healed so
[1:41:33] praise the lord that's my desire and
[1:41:35] that's my prayer
[1:41:37] that's where we leave it
[1:41:38] but many cast out devils and jesus said
[1:41:42] i've never had relations with you
[1:41:44] you know that's what that word new there
[1:41:45] is
[1:41:46] never knew you the new is i never had a
[1:41:49] relation with you you've never had
[1:41:51] relation to me oh sure you went about
[1:41:52] saying you were a christian you went
[1:41:54] about trying to speak in tongues and do
[1:41:56] all these wonderful works but it wasn't
[1:41:58] according to my will
[1:42:00] it was your gate not my gate
[1:42:03] it was what you wanted not what i want
[1:42:06] amen that's what god rejects am i not
[1:42:09] what i want to do why i want to go do
[1:42:11] this what does god say about it
[1:42:14] amen
[1:42:16] that's what matters because many will
[1:42:18] come and say they've done this and
[1:42:20] they've done that
[1:42:21] they are they that testify of me
[1:42:25] mine
[1:42:26] one more thing i'm going to read this
[1:42:28] scripture we'll close colossians
[1:42:31] chapter 3.
[1:42:36] the sad part is saying so many times
[1:42:38] people say and believe truly believe
[1:42:41] like i said with cain that god is with
[1:42:43] him when he is not
[1:42:46] he's not
[1:42:47] i i hate it's just true
[1:42:50] and i wouldn't say it if it wasn't
[1:42:52] plainly
[1:42:54] labeled in the scripture for us to read
[1:42:56] but it's just true
[1:42:58] we just read it they think he's with
[1:43:00] them but he's not but look at these
[1:43:02] wonderful verses being done but it's not
[1:43:05] of god
[1:43:06] that's not where god placed his name yes
[1:43:10] it's his choosing not mine not yours
[1:43:14] nobody else's
[1:43:17] colossians chapter 3 verse 12
[1:43:21] put on therefore as the elect of god
[1:43:24] holy and beloved bowels of mercy
[1:43:27] kindness humbleness of mind
[1:43:30] meekness long suffering
[1:43:32] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[1:43:34] another
[1:43:36] if any man have a quarrel against any
[1:43:38] even as christ forgave
[1:43:40] you all use forgave you so also do ye
[1:43:46] yes amen
[1:43:50] when the lord leads me i want to try to
[1:43:53] preach on that bitterness again the
[1:43:56] offense again
[1:43:57] but that forgiveness part is so powerful
[1:44:00] yes
[1:44:02] i still to this day
[1:44:04] have people from time to time tell me or
[1:44:06] i hear people say
[1:44:08] i could never forgive them
[1:44:11] they don't deserve forgiveness
[1:44:14] or some some words to that effect
[1:44:19] and it
[1:44:20] and then claim to be a christian
[1:44:22] and i said how
[1:44:24] do you even know the word how could you
[1:44:27] know the word and say those words right
[1:44:30] how could you know what jesus said about
[1:44:32] it and recognize by personal experience
[1:44:37] what god has done by forgiving you
[1:44:40] and then say those words
[1:44:42] although what i've done wasn't as bad as
[1:44:44] them really you're sure of that right
[1:44:49] that's what that's when people start uh
[1:44:51] uh classifying sin and that's just a
[1:44:54] worldly thing
[1:44:55] you know
[1:44:56] that's just a worldly thing the world
[1:44:58] has that
[1:44:59] that's what the world puts because
[1:45:02] the the justice system
[1:45:05] you know there's there's misdemeanors
[1:45:07] and there's higher categories there's
[1:45:09] federal crimes or state local crimes
[1:45:12] there's all levels of wrongdoings so you
[1:45:15] get up to a federal crime or something
[1:45:19] i guess you know walking
[1:45:21] walking unauthorized on this in the
[1:45:23] state capitol that that's
[1:45:26] chop your head off for doing that but
[1:45:28] that all levels of of crimes and see
[1:45:32] that's the mentality that people get
[1:45:34] well this certain this sin is worse than
[1:45:35] that i wasn't about a sinner as they
[1:45:37] were well they did this and they and and
[1:45:40] i was just a
[1:45:41] we're all sinners saved by the grace of
[1:45:44] god yes there's no big eyes there's no
[1:45:46] little use there's no respect or person
[1:45:48] with god
[1:45:49] so you can't say their sin was greater
[1:45:51] what god forgave them up what god's
[1:45:54] asked me to forgive them was more than
[1:45:56] what god forgave me no it's not
[1:45:59] never could be
[1:46:00] because i was a sinner
[1:46:03] saved by his grace i
[1:46:05] wanted nothing to do with him
[1:46:08] but thank god he never gave up on me so
[1:46:12] it baffles me sometimes i got off a
[1:46:14] little bit on that but
[1:46:16] that that forgiveness is very powerful
[1:46:19] for bearing one another forgiving one
[1:46:21] another if any man have a quarrel
[1:46:22] against any even as christ forgave you
[1:46:25] so also do you
[1:46:28] and above all these things put on
[1:46:30] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[1:46:33] perfectness
[1:46:34] that is the agape love charity is agape
[1:46:37] that's a charity is a love and action
[1:46:40] and that's what agape is agape is a love
[1:46:42] and action
[1:46:44] and let the peace of god rule in your
[1:46:45] hearts
[1:46:47] to the which also ye are called in one
[1:46:50] body and be thankful
[1:46:52] that the word of christ dwell in you
[1:46:54] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:46:56] admonishing one another in psalms hymns
[1:46:59] spiritual songs singing with grace in
[1:47:01] your hearts to the lord and whatsoever
[1:47:04] whatsoever that pretty much means
[1:47:06] anything
[1:47:07] anything that you do whatsoever you do
[1:47:10] in word or deed
[1:47:12] do all in the name of the lord jesus

[1:47:41] identify with him yes amen all the words

[1:47:46] people don't identify with themselves
[1:47:48] with it they'll identify with the father
[1:47:50] son of holy ghost or some denomination
[1:47:52] but they want to identify themselves

[1:55:12] i'll let him explain it i could go into
[1:55:14] some detail but i'll let him do it
[1:55:16] because
[1:55:17] he says
[1:55:18] of course he experiences so it's great
[1:55:20] passion to him
[1:55:27] you can be seated if you like
[1:55:38] well i've had
[1:55:41] some conviction for
[1:55:44] some weeks
[1:55:46] and uh
[1:55:48] i i believe god's uh
[1:55:52] working with me the way he does he tells
[1:55:54] me
[1:55:55] what he wants me to think about what he
[1:55:56] wants me to do what
[1:56:00] what his plans are
[1:56:02] he's suggested to me
[1:56:06] two or three times
[1:56:09] to pray for others
[1:56:12] and i'm not very good at praying for
[1:56:14] others but um
[1:56:16] why me i guess he wants to tune me up i
[1:56:18] don't know
[1:56:19] but
[1:56:22] he's all
[1:56:24] i keep thinking that that
[1:56:26] i'm gonna do what he wants me to do and
[1:56:31] he said do this and it didn't happen and
[1:56:34] he said do this and it didn't happen and
[1:56:37] i guess the
[1:56:39] green lights are not lining up
[1:56:42] and
[1:56:45] so
[1:56:47] it seems like the
[1:56:49] lights lined up today
[1:56:51] for now and so
[1:56:54] the lord's here and i'm saying he's uh
[1:56:56] he's he's with us he's directing this
[1:56:59] uh it's not something i wanted to do but
[1:57:01] something that he wanted me to do or
[1:57:03] something he wants
[1:57:05] for you
[1:57:06] for you
[1:57:08] yes
[1:57:09] it's not for me yes i know i'm
[1:57:11] getting operated on tomorrow but that's
[1:57:13] that's fine i have no problem with that
[1:57:18] it's not normal i think so i don't think
[1:57:20] the same problem
[1:57:21] but um
[1:57:23] um he asked me to to pray for the sick
[1:57:27] and and
[1:57:28] [Music]
[1:57:30] we don't have very many people here
[1:57:32] today but evidently whoever's here is
[1:57:35] is who needs to hear this and who wants
[1:57:38] to do this
[1:57:39] it's for you amen
[1:57:42] the lord convicted me in this way
[1:57:45] he had me go search out these old
[1:57:48] um
[1:57:49] i give scrapbooks through the years and
[1:57:53] so i have um
[1:57:55] old old records
[1:57:58] and
[1:58:00] i guess i'm older than i think i am
[1:58:04] but uh i i
[1:58:06] i got this old record that he sent me
[1:58:08] after it took me a long time to search
[1:58:10] it out but
[1:58:12] i knew it was there
[1:58:14] and and he knew it was there and and
[1:58:18] today it found his way here
[1:58:20] so this is this is um
[1:58:23] from brother branham and it's um
[1:58:26] it's it's probably a forum letter but
[1:58:28] has his picture on it now and he signed
[1:58:31] it at the bottom
[1:58:33] and then
[1:58:35] there's a post grip on it and
[1:58:38] i see though there's there's a there's
[1:58:40] another
[1:58:41] form letter uh later
[1:58:44] behind it and it's
[1:58:47] uh brother branham signed his name uh
[1:58:50] reverend william branham
[1:58:52] and the second one says
[1:58:56] brother branham
[1:58:57] but in the old days we knew about the
[1:59:00] the typist was uh
[1:59:03] was a different person than the person
[1:59:04] that was uh dictating the letter
[1:59:07] in the old days the typist put his
[1:59:10] initials down there and he put bb
[1:59:12] slash wpb
[1:59:14] that means billy paul billy paul wrote
[1:59:17] this and that's billy paul signing
[1:59:19] brother branham
[1:59:21] on this on this one but
[1:59:24] that that tells me that
[1:59:26] um
[1:59:28] the bs on this one was was from billy
[1:59:32] paul but the the letter was signed by
[1:59:35] reverend branham and he prayed for this
[1:59:38] prayer cloth thank you
[1:59:40] and that's very cloth
[1:59:42] is what the holy spirit has been
[1:59:44] convicting me for
[1:59:45] i mean this is really old
[1:59:48] but uh
[1:59:49] he's been
[1:59:51] the holy spirit's been convicted me to
[1:59:53] bring this prayer cloth down here
[1:59:55] and pray for anyone that wants to come
[1:59:57] up here
[1:59:58] and
[2:00:01] touch this prank or a pair of cloth or
[2:00:04] be prayed for him
[2:00:06] you know
[2:00:08] i don't know what more i can say i just
[2:00:10] felt
[2:00:12] he told them he told people to believe
[2:00:16] and that unbelief was the sin well
[2:00:19] then he said go see him no more
[2:00:21] well if you believe it you can't
[2:00:23] unbelieve it i guess
[2:00:25] i cannot believe it stand
[2:00:28] go in sin no more
[2:00:30] but he said
[2:00:32] he could be healed and brother random
[2:00:34] used these little claws
[2:00:36] for to pray for emil people yes and then
[2:00:41] and then brother branham passed on after
[2:00:43] that but
[2:00:46] i'm willing to share this with you uh
[2:00:50] at this point in time that evidently is
[2:00:57] sister tracy mr theresa brother yes
[2:01:01] when i was coming
[2:01:03] to church

[2:08:23] it's like i said
[2:08:25] not something that i asked for not
[2:08:28] something brother pat asked for
[2:08:30] when god's speaking to your hearts and
[2:08:32] speaking in his heart and god is moving
[2:08:34] he does it for a reason
[2:08:36] amen
[2:08:38] you know i could have after his over
[2:08:40] could have just asked me anybody wanted
[2:08:41] prayer but when god does something like
[2:08:44] that and puts such a strong conviction
[2:08:46] on somebody's heart and then on
[2:08:47] somebody's heart coming down the road
[2:08:49] and
[2:08:51] what the lord is doing here it's him
[2:08:54] amen we've got to believe it receive it
[2:08:56] praise the lord you know
[2:08:58] some people of the world
[2:09:01] nominal christians charismatic they they
[2:09:02] won't they won't believe it if there's
[2:09:04] just not a bunch of shouting screaming
[2:09:06] and speaking in tongues and going on
[2:09:08] but the power of god is here
[2:09:11] i feel it myself just pulsating through
[2:09:13] me
[2:09:14] and i know you do
[2:09:16] and that that's what i prayed for yes
[2:09:19] that's what i pray for every sunday
[2:09:21] but god is here
[2:09:24] you've been prayed for even if you
[2:09:26] didn't come up here
[2:09:27] amen god is delivered
[2:09:31] god is blessed
[2:09:32] god is touched
[2:09:34] i believe it
[2:09:35] amen
[2:09:37] praise the lord jesus
[2:09:40] i believe the lord's given you what you
[2:09:41] want sister trees
[2:09:43] amen
[2:09:52] praise the lord
[2:09:55] brother pat also
[2:09:57] felt that the lord spoke to him when we
[2:09:59] were talking last week about the word of
[2:10:00] god
[2:10:02] being the sword of the word and that
[2:10:03] sword hitting brother branham's hand
[2:10:06] at the
[2:10:07] pulpit rock sword mountain sabino canyon
[2:10:10] and that sword hit his hand
[2:10:12] that the lord spoke to him and had him
[2:10:14] bring a sword he had here
[2:10:17] today
[2:10:18] uh i didn't bring it in here i thought
[2:10:20] it might be a little distracting for the
[2:10:22] service and the ministry and all but uh
[2:10:24] but
[2:10:25] it put a little
[2:10:27] emphasis on
[2:10:29] the sword of the word
[2:10:31] and what it is when you look at it and
[2:10:32] you can touch it and you can see it
[2:10:35] and and it
[2:10:37] means something different than when you
[2:10:39] see that
[2:10:40] you think brother branham sword struck
[2:10:42] his hand
[2:10:44] and so it's outside so when we dismiss
[2:10:47] and
[2:10:47] go outside
[2:10:49] it was brother pat's desire that
[2:10:51] everybody look at it touch it
[2:10:54] get that
[2:10:55] in your heart and your mind that that
[2:10:57] sword
[2:10:58] that sword of the word and that that
[2:11:00] brother branham experienced when he was
[2:11:02] there
[2:11:03] uh up there praying
[2:11:05] that that word is a sharp powerful
[2:11:08] two-edged sword
[2:11:10] amen
[2:11:11] praise the lord so that will be out
[2:11:14] there too
[2:11:15] so
[2:11:18] amen
[2:11:20] praise the lord so
[2:11:22] before you leave make sure
[2:11:24] of course it's hard to miss it's sitting
[2:11:26] on my sitting on my desk there but um
[2:11:30] for everybody to see touch handle
[2:11:32] amen probably won't let the
[2:11:34] little ones take it out of its sheath
[2:11:36] but can see it anyway it's beautiful
[2:11:39] it's it's something to hold so i
[2:11:42] encourage them
[2:11:44] hold that i know it's symbolic or
[2:11:46] metaphoric of the word
[2:11:48] it's still what the word says yes
[2:11:51] and i don't believe the lord would have
[2:11:53] told brother pat to do that if there
[2:11:54] wasn't something to it so
[2:11:56] just like the prayer class and
[2:11:58] coming forth in prayer so
[2:12:00] amen
[2:12:01] thank you jesus
[2:12:13] do anyone else have anything before
[2:12:14] dismissed
[2:12:21] praise the lord god bless you appreciate
[2:12:23] each one of you coming being here today
[2:12:26] try something said to bless and
[2:12:27] strengthen you i certainly absolutely
[2:12:30] understand why the lord put this on my
[2:12:32] heart for today so
[2:12:35] it's just all him
[2:12:37] amen i know i know everybody does
[2:12:39] friends
[2:12:40] and i wouldn't be here if i didn't
[2:12:42] but i believe this is a place that god
[2:12:45] has chosen amen
[2:12:47] one of the places i'm not going to say
[2:12:49] we're the only obviously god has them
[2:12:52] all over the world i believe we're one
[2:12:53] of the places i believe and again i
[2:12:56] wouldn't be if i didn't believe that but
[2:12:58] amen i believe that the lord was pleased
[2:13:00] with what has been done today
[2:13:04] amen in his name in jesus name
[2:13:08] not in his name in jesus name this many
[2:13:11] people say in your name what is that
[2:13:13] name or in his name
[2:13:15] jesus name
[2:13:16] amen
[2:13:18] praise the lord so god reaches you bless
[2:13:20] you but you just pray
[2:13:26] lord

[2:14:21] lord the world's a crazy place we don't
[2:14:23] just

[2:14:26] amen they're good things
[2:14:28] yes they read the bible the bible is
[2:14:31] your word yes it tells you to think
[2:14:33] about these things amen yes
