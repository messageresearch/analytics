[11:27] Oh, and just hit that note there, that
[11:29] inspired verse that says, "You've been

[11:50] the lovely name of our Lord and Savior.
[11:52] God bless you. Welcome to the house of
[11:54] the Lord today. If you're streaming, God
[11:55] bless you. Greet in the name of the Lord
[11:57] Jesus. Welcome, brother Null. Amen. To
[12:00] come and minister for us today and
[12:01] sister Shirley with him. So very
[12:03] thankful to have them again today. Amen.
[12:05] And appreciate them being with us. Let's
[12:08] just bow our heads if we could for a
[12:09] word of prayer. Just invite his presence
[12:12] today. Amen. Lord Jesus,
[12:15] very thankful once again today, Lord,
[12:17] for another beautiful day that you've
[12:19] given us. Father, it's not beautiful
[12:21] because the weather outside is nice.
[12:23] It's beautiful because you are alive.
[12:25] You are Jesus Christ, the same
[12:27] yesterday, today, and forever. And you
[12:29] are with us. You are in us. You were
[12:31] leading, guiding, and directing us. We
[12:34] come into this house, your house, Lord,
[12:36] to worship and to glorify and to exalt
[12:39] your holy and precious name. So thankful
[12:42] of this another time, God, that you give
[12:45] us. We don't know how many more of these
[12:46] times that we have, but Lord, we want to
[12:48] take advantage of every moment that we
[12:50] have, God, to come to your house to
[12:53] worship, to praise you, to glorify you.
[12:55] Lord, we see the things of the world and
[12:57] how this time is winding up. But God, we
[12:59] know that eternity is right at the
[13:02] doorstep for us. We're looking for that
[13:04] body change. We're looking for our loved
[13:05] ones to appear before us at any time
[13:08] that we go home to be with you. And so
[13:10] shall we ever be with the Lord. Oh,
[13:13] bless this service today, God, as we
[13:14] commit it into your hands. Lord, bless
[13:16] brother no, Father, as he brings the
[13:18] word. May your hand be upon him and
[13:20] strengthen him and bless him. Speak to
[13:22] him through him, Lord. May you speak to
[13:24] him, God, to for whatever we have need
[13:26] of today. Lord, we're a needy people,
[13:29] God. We commit ourselves to you. We
[13:32] rebuke every demonic spirit that would
[13:34] try to hurt, hind or infiltrate this
[13:35] service in any way that you get the
[13:38] glory, honor, and praise for all that is
[13:40] done in this done in this place today.
[13:42] We commit it to you now. Ask your
[13:44] blessings. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[13:46] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be
[13:49] seated if you'd like. Amen. It was
[13:52] something when brother Null and Sister
[13:53] Shirley came through the door this
[13:55] morning, it uh just uh kind of redawned
[13:59] on me that uh good friend of mine,
[14:01] Brother Mike Worers, had gone to be with
[14:02] the Lord since we saw them last. And uh
[14:05] he was a precious brother. I loved him
[14:07] very much. And we've been talking about
[14:09] adoption and placement. And if I was to
[14:12] say anybody found their place in the
[14:13] Lord, it was brother Mike. Uh if I've
[14:16] ever there's only this is a bold
[14:19] statement but there's only two men that
[14:22] I can recall that I know were Godfilled
[14:26] God bought Godborn
[14:28] song leaders and that was Mike orders
[14:30] and brother Terry Walker. Those the two
[14:32] people that I know Amen. The Lord has
[14:35] showed me I know that I believe brother
[14:37] Mike orders that he fulfilled his
[14:39] position in this. I wish he was here to
[14:41] sing this song service. It' be a whole
[14:43] lot better than what you're about to
[14:44] endure today. But Amen. 581. We'll go
[14:48] turn over to 581. We'll have it on the
[14:50] screen here too for you. And I saw love,
[14:53] mercy, and grace. Amen. Praise the Lord
[14:57] Jesus. That's what we see when we look
[14:59] at it. Love, mercy, and grace. Amen.
[15:03] I saw love,
[15:06] mercy,
[15:07] and grace.
[15:11] I saw love,
[15:14] mercy,
[15:15] and grace.
[15:18] I envision,
[15:21] his beauty.
[15:23] I look
[15:25] on his face.
[15:28] I saw love,
[15:31] mercy,
[15:33] and grace.
[15:35] [Music]
[15:36] I saw love,
[15:39] mercy,
[15:41] and grace.
[15:43] [Music]
[15:45] I saw love,
[15:48] mercy,
[15:50] and grace.
[15:54] I envision
[15:56] his beauty.
[15:59] I look
[16:01] on each face and I saw love,
[16:07] mercy
[16:08] and grace. Oh, with all your hearts now.

[17:02] mercy,
[17:03] and grace.
[17:08] I envision
[17:10] his beauty.
[17:13] I look
[17:15] on his face and I saw love,
[17:20] mercy,
[17:22] and grace.
[17:26] Oh, hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[17:29] That's all we see when we look at him.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. His love, mercy, and grace. If it
[17:35] weren't for that, saints, where would we
[17:37] be today?
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord Jesus.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[18:05] book this morning.
[18:07] [Music]
[18:11] The love of God
[18:14] is greater far
[18:19] than tongue or pin
[18:23] can ever tell.
[18:27] It goes beyond
[18:30] the highest star
[18:34] and it reaches
[18:37] to the lowest hill.
[18:42] The guilty pair
[18:46] bowed down with care.
[18:51] God gave his son
[18:55] to win.
[18:58] His every child
[19:01] he reconciled
[19:03] [Music]
[19:05] and parted from
[19:10] his sin.
[19:14] Oh love of God,
[19:18] how rich and pure,
[19:20] [Music]
[19:22] how measureless
[19:26] and strong
[19:30] it shall forever
[19:34] more endure.
[19:38] The saints end
[19:43] so
[19:46] when years of time
[19:49] shall pass away
[19:51] [Applause]
[19:53] and earthly thrones
[19:56] and kingdoms fall.
[20:00] And men who hear
[20:03] refuse to pray
[20:06] on rocks and hills
[20:10] and mountains call.
[20:14] God's love so sure
[20:17] shall still endure.
[20:21] All measureless
[20:25] and strong
[20:28] redeeming grace
[20:32] to Adam's race
[20:36] the saints and name
[20:40] Jill song.

[20:55] and strong
[20:58] it shall forever
[21:02] more endure
[21:05] the saints and
[21:09] shall soul. Listen to this last verse
[21:12] now.
[21:14] Could we within
[21:17] the ocean filled?
[21:21] And were the skies
[21:24] of parchment made?
[21:28] Were every stall
[21:31] on earth a queer
[21:35] and every man
[21:38] ascribe by dream
[21:42] to write the love
[21:46] of God above
[21:49] would drain the old
[21:53] sh
[21:56] nor Destroy
[22:00] contain the home.
[22:03] No stretched from sky. Hallelujah
[22:07] to sky.
[22:10] Oh love of God,
[22:14] how rich and pure,
[22:18] how measureless
[22:22] and strong.
[22:25] It shall forever
[22:29] more endure
[22:32] the saints and name
[22:36] just song. Go one more time now. Oh love
[22:40] of God,
[22:43] how rich and pure,
[22:46] how measureless
[22:50] and strong.
[22:54] It shall forever
[22:56] [Music]
[22:58] more endure
[23:01] the saints and

[23:16] how righteous, how strong.
[23:19] Amen. That love reached down one day and
[23:23] saw me. Amen. Picked me up, set me upon
[23:28] his rock to stay. Oh, hallelujah. Thank
[23:33] God for the love of God. Lord, would we
[23:35] be without it? Hallelujah. Thank you,
[23:37] Jesus. Amen. One more before we go to
[23:41] the Lord in prayer. Amen.
[23:44] You know, I believe Brother Ram said the
[23:46] last verse of that song was written on
[23:47] the wall of an insane asylum.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Think about the love of God.
[23:53] What it is to think about the love of
[23:54] God. Amen. How rich, how pure. Amen.
[23:59] Praise the Lord. One more before we go
[24:02] to the Lord in prayer. Now, Psalm number
[24:03] 343.
[24:05] Amen.
[24:07] Praise the Lord. If that isn't love, my
[24:09] sister loved this song so much. She sang
[24:11] it all the time.
[24:13] Amen.
[24:15] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[24:20] I don't know, Mike. I might need to
[24:21] start with the chorus on this one.
[24:24] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[24:30] [Music]
[24:42] I'm not getting for some reason.
[24:46] The ocean
[24:48] is dry.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; There's no stars in the sky.
[24:58] And the sparrow
[25:01] can fly.
[25:05] If that is in love,
[25:10] then heavens
[25:13] are me.
[25:16] Well, there's no feeling like this.
[25:23] If that isn't love.
[25:29] If that isn't love.
[25:34] The ocean is dry.
[25:40] There's no stars in the sky.
[25:46] And the sparrow can fly.
[25:50] [Music]
[25:52] If that isn't love,
[25:56] [Music]
[25:58] then heavens
[26:01] are me.
[26:04] Well, there's no feeling like this
[26:10] if that isn't love. One more time. Yes,
[26:16] if that isn't love.
[26:22] The ocean
[26:24] is dry.
[26:28] There's no stars in the sky.
[26:33] And the sparrow can fly.
[26:40] If that isn't love,
[26:45] then heavens
[26:47] are me.
[26:51] There's no feeling like this.
[26:56] [Music]
[26:57] If that isn't love,
[27:03] amen. Oh, praise the Lord. That is love.
[27:07] A love the world knows nothing about.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; A love that is greater than any human
[27:12] understanding, any human comprehension.
[27:15] That love goes far beyond anything
[27:17] anybody would even imagine. Amen. The
[27:20] world, the way the world world describes
[27:23] love today is you just have to go along
[27:24] with anything and everything they do and
[27:26] think and feel and say. That's love. You
[27:28] you only love someone if you agree with
[27:30] everything they do. That's not love,
[27:33] friend. Love reaches out to a lost soul
[27:35] and tells them that they're wrong and
[27:37] tries to get them in. Amen. A love is a
[27:40] love that reaches out to try to keep
[27:41] somebody from going to hell. Amen.
[27:44] Brings them in to try to try to bring
[27:46] them to salvation. That's love. That's
[27:49] God's love. Amen. It's the only love
[27:51] there is to me. Praise the Lord. It's
[27:53] God's love. Amen. What a love it is.
[27:57] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Go to the
[28:00] Lord in prayer. Amen.
[28:02] take prayer requests. I have a few to
[28:04] mention to you today. Brother Dennis is
[28:05] not with us again. Uh he's having a real
[28:08] struggle with his foot. If you please
[28:09] pray for him. Uh as you know, he's a
[28:11] diabetic, but he's got that ulcer on the
[28:13] bottom of his foot. He just can't get
[28:15] well. Uh he had two skin grafts as we
[28:18] said last week. The second one still
[28:20] didn't take. Uh so this doctor is really
[28:23] confused that not sure why it's not
[28:26] taking. So she recommended to go to
[28:28] another doctor. Maybe there's something
[28:30] that she's missing something. She's not
[28:32] thinking of something uh to help. But we
[28:35] know who the healer is.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; He knows who the healer is. Brother
[28:39] Dennis knows his healing comes from the
[28:41] Lord Jesus. Amen. So, let's please
[28:44] remember uh him in prayer. The Lord
[28:46] would touch his foot. Amen. And uh and
[28:48] heal that. Also, Brother Danny, please
[28:51] remember to pray for him. Amen. He needs
[28:53] a special brother Danny's going through
[28:56] some spiritual battles. So, please
[28:58] remember him in prayer. He really needs
[28:59] the Lord to reach out, send the Holy
[29:01] Ghost to his way, bring him back in.
[29:04] Amen. Bring him back. Sister Norma's not
[29:06] with us today. Uh her uh
[29:10] dog got attacked and she I guess she
[29:15] said as she said she took the brunt of
[29:17] it, but she's feeling better, but she
[29:19] stayed home to I guess to nurse the dog
[29:21] that they the other little dog that they
[29:23] had. So, uh please remember her in
[29:25] prayer as well. Sister Julie's not going
[29:27] to be with us today. I do have a
[29:29] testimony from her that I want to give
[29:30] to you, but we'll do that a little bit
[29:32] later. Amen. So, please pray for her.
[29:35] Uh, I guess Art,
[29:37] &gt;&gt; he's still trying to get better.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Art's been sick. He's
[29:42] had some his back's been given so much
[29:45] problems. It's him at work. So, please
[29:47] remember him in prayer. Good to have
[29:49] Shrine kids with us. So, uh, remember
[29:53] brother Pat, sister Pat, they're not
[29:56] with us, of course. Uh, So healing,
[29:59] mending, getting better from operations.
[30:01] And just as he says every time, they're
[30:03] just getting old. Uh so coming to church
[30:06] is a little more difficult, but they
[30:08] always stream. I hope and pray they're
[30:10] streaming. Of course, brother Dennis
[30:11] probably is and others. So please
[30:13] remember, we're just God bless you. Hate
[30:15] that you're not here with us, but uh
[30:17] we're so thankful that the Lord touch
[30:19] you. Please remember sister Karen and uh
[30:21] brother Tom. haven't heard of a time
[30:24] frame that they'll be coming back down,
[30:25] but it's going to be getting cold up
[30:27] here pretty quick. So, looking forward
[30:29] to having them back with us as well. Uh,
[30:31] as you know, this is Sister Anna's week
[30:34] to work. So, remember her and Stephen
[30:36] prayer and Madison the Lord. So, it's a
[30:39] lot of names, a lot of prayer requests,
[30:41] a lot of people not here. Amen. And I
[30:43] told brother null before church, I said,
[30:45] "When I went to minister, whenever I
[30:47] minister, if I'm ministering, whether
[30:48] I'm pastoring or visiting, whatever it
[30:50] is, I've never cared how many people
[30:52] that were there." Uh, I went to a
[30:54] service one time with a brother, there
[30:55] was there was not a single other male in
[30:58] the entire church but me. Not one of
[31:00] everybody else there was females. I led
[31:02] the opening prayer, the
[31:05] I had every prayer. I had every ser uh
[31:07] uh song, the ministry, I did everything
[31:10] in the service. That's never bothered
[31:12] me. But when you pastor and you have a
[31:13] visiting minister, you really like to
[31:15] have people in the seats, uh even though
[31:18] I know Brother Null can look up at the
[31:19] camera, there's probably as many or
[31:21] maybe more on that camera right now than
[31:23] there is sitting here. But uh but we're
[31:25] very thankful for those that have come
[31:27] and are here. And we're thankful for
[31:28] those that are watching, too. But please
[31:30] remember these requests of these needs
[31:32] that we have today. Amen. The Lord is
[31:34] mindful of them all. Is anyone else has
[31:36] something special on your heart you'd
[31:37] like to mention?
[31:40] Amen. unspoken request. The Lord knows
[31:43] all of our hearts today and so thankful
[31:45] that he does. Let's stand to our feet if
[31:47] we could. Amen. Looking forward to the
[31:50] message today.

[33:30] she said she wouldn't be able to make it
[33:31] to church, but she wanted to give this
[33:32] testimony. Uh and I want to make sure
[33:35] just cut through this. So um
[33:40] uh want the church to know to give a
[33:43] testimony that my sister's illness uh
[33:46] was healed quickly when the doctor found
[33:48] her uh incision was infected. She had a
[33:51] surgery on her foot. Uh she had she got
[33:54] a new cast put on and a different
[33:56] antibiotic. The sickness she had uh for
[34:00] a week resolved in 24 hours. Amen.
[34:03] Praise the Lord. Maybe I should use
[34:05] this. I'm used to having a little bit
[34:06] fail uh for you. Uh let's see. No,
[34:10] that's it. So, she wanted to thank God
[34:12] for uh healing her sister very quick
[34:16] that I think it was Achilles. It was
[34:18] Achilles that she had um if I remember.
[34:22] So thankful for that. The Lord just
[34:24] blessed and touched her and helped her
[34:26] to get to heal and get well quickly.
[34:29] Amen. I appreciate your prayers for me.
[34:31] I had a good week. It was a rough week.
[34:33] It was a lot of hours. Always is. Uh but
[34:36] uh the Lord worked out. I felt good and
[34:38] felt strong. And uh so thankful towards
[34:41] the end of the day Friday uh after lunch
[34:44] my my Achilles started. I didn't even
[34:46] know what this was. But it started
[34:48] hurting so bad. I didn't feel a pop or
[34:50] anything. Uh what they would say if you
[34:53] rupture or something or what they call
[34:55] it, maybe it is rupture, achilles tear.
[34:59] Uh so I didn't feel anything like that,
[35:00] but it was just really hurt and have a
[35:02] hard time. And I still I still had three
[35:04] or four more hours going up and down a
[35:06] ladder 100 times. Up, down, up, down.
[35:09] And it's it's that much more when you're
[35:11] stepping on something and you're on a
[35:14] ladder and your heel goes down when
[35:16] you're going up. And it just made it
[35:17] that much harder. But uh thankfully the
[35:20] Lord blessed it. It was hurting
[35:21] yesterday. I had a hard time walking and
[35:24] getting around, but thankfully yesterday
[35:26] I was off. Was just had to get from the
[35:28] hotel to the airport to the airport to
[35:30] uh and then home. So I'm thankful for
[35:34] that. And this morning I woke up and I
[35:36] got in here and started praying this
[35:37] morning and uh it dawned on me because I
[35:40] always thank God for my health and my
[35:42] strength and healing and uh as you all
[35:44] know my knees I haven't worn my braces
[35:46] in two or three months now. My knees my
[35:48] knees are so good being able to get down
[35:50] on the floor to work now again. Uh God
[35:53] just healed them. I'm so thankful for
[35:55] that. But I started praying about that
[35:57] and I thought about that Achilles and I
[35:58] thought I didn't even felt it this
[36:00] morning. didn't even didn't even
[36:02] remember that it was even sore or hurt
[36:04] or anything. I looked up yesterday and
[36:06] it just said that if it's sore or
[36:08] hurting like that, it's from overuse. I
[36:10] thought, well, I've certainly did that.
[36:12] That's for sure. Uh but I didn't even
[36:14] feel it this morning. Didn't even
[36:15] realize, didn't even remember it until
[36:18] um till I was in prayer and the Lord
[36:21] brought back back to my attention. I
[36:22] said, "Yes, thank you, Lord." Uh
[36:25] healing. Amen. God is our healer. So,
[36:28] praise the Lord. I'm so thankful he is.

[36:32] Lord. Amen. We'll sing one more. We're

[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. You know,
[41:33] it's uh it's really it it really
[41:36] illuminates when you become a parent of
[41:38] the love of God. And you can often speak
[41:42] on it and think about it how that love
[41:44] can equate over to the human element
[41:46] when it's a parent and a child and know
[41:50] that no matter
[41:52] and having raised two children, no
[41:54] matter how far they had gone or how deep
[41:56] they had gotten or where they were, you
[41:59] still loved them.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prodigal son came back. He
[42:04] the dad loved that son so much. The son
[42:06] was scared to death of his dad. He
[42:08] afraid of what it was going to happen,
[42:09] what he's going to do. He came and said,
[42:10] "Dad, I'll just be a servant. Just let
[42:12] me." He said, "Oh my." Put a ring on his
[42:15] finger, put the cloak on him. Let's
[42:17] celebrate and have a party. My son's
[42:19] come home.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That love never left.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And that love never does leave. Praise

[42:38] him our way. I trust he has something
[42:40] for uh us to say. We've been praying for
[42:43] him. Amen. Over the past few weeks that
[42:45] the Lord would just give him what we
[42:47] have need of and trust that that would
[42:48] be so. So let's sing Only Believe.

[42:53] word for us here now. Amen. Sing it with
[42:56] all your heart now. Holy
[43:00] believe.
[43:03] All that you believe
[43:07] that all things are possible.
[43:13] Only
[43:16] believe.
[43:17] [Music]
[43:18] Only
[43:21] believe.
[43:24] Only
[43:26] believe
[43:29] all things are possible.
[43:34] Only
[43:36] believe.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you all in the name of
[43:42] the Lord Jesus Christ. And it's my
[43:44] privilege to to be with you once again.
[43:48] Um I have a
[43:51] If you'd stand in honor of God's word, I
[43:54] just I'm not much in preliminary. It's
[43:56] just the way I am. Turn to Hebrews the
[43:59] fourth chapter and read verses one and
[44:01] two. And the basic subject matter is
[44:04] resting. Learning to rest in God.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; That's something God's been dealing with
[44:10] me and uh Lord willing'll be able to get
[44:14] into it and be able to bless you with
[44:16] it.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. to Hebrews the 4th chapter verse
[44:19] starting in verse one says let us
[44:21] therefore fear lest they promise being
[44:23] left up so entering into his rest any of
[44:25] you should seem to come short of it for
[44:28] unto us was the gospel of praise as well
[44:30] as unto them but the word praise did not
[44:33] profit them not being mixed with faith
[44:35] then they heard it
[44:36] &gt;&gt; amen let's just pray
[44:40] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[44:41] father it is again our privilege is to
[44:43] come and gather ourselves together as
[44:45] part of your body here on
[44:47] Lord, you've chosen to speak through a
[44:49] man and it's fallen my lot, Lord, to
[44:51] stand before the purchase of your blood.
[44:55] But Lord, they haven't come to hear me.
[44:56] They've come to listen to you. So Lord,
[44:58] use my voice.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Speak through me, Lord, in way that you
[45:02] would bless the people.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Grant this for I ask it in Jesus
[45:05] Christ's name.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; You know it says in Hebrews what it says
[45:12] here, it says, "Let us let us therefore
[45:14] fear." And I looked up the fear and some
[45:17] people oh trembling and stuff. It it's
[45:19] it's to be fearful of that there's
[45:21] something that we're missing.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; It's realizing that there's something
[45:25] that God has for us but we're we might
[45:29] be missing it if we don't concentrate on
[45:32] it. If we if we don't accept it, if we
[45:34] don't grasp hold of what God has been
[45:36] trying to do for us.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "For unto us the gospel was
[45:40] preached as well as unto them, but the
[45:42] work preached did not profit them not
[45:44] being mixed faith and heard it right.
[45:47] And when I began to look at what God has
[45:49] done in this generation, God sent to us
[45:51] a prophet.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; God through that prophet performed
[45:55] miracle, miracle after miracle after
[45:58] miracle. God became in my in my God for
[46:02] me became a reality. He wasn't something
[46:04] I read about as as a child, not
[46:07] something that the the preachers
[46:08] preached about or the Sunday school
[46:10] taught us about. No. But when I begin to
[46:12] look at the life and the ministry of the
[46:14] prophet, God in him became a reality to
[46:16] me.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; It isn't I don't I don't worship brother
[46:18] Brad, but I have confidence in what God
[46:21] has said through him.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; And and uh I got this little thought
[46:27] about a week or so ago. You know, life
[46:29] is a journey into an unknown.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; We don't know what tomorrow's going to
[46:33] bring.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Everything could be going fine today and
[46:36] then tomorrow everything can turn upside
[46:38] down and go who knows where. Okay. But
[46:40] who are you going to trust to lead you
[46:42] becomes the thought.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; When I was and I and one of the things
[46:47] here again what I was thinking about he
[46:48] says I says I I I personally believe
[46:52] that Christians should be able to so
[46:54] place their faith in God that we that we
[46:57] can be in a constant state of rest.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; A state where we no longer fear tomorrow
[47:02] or what it may bring because we know God
[47:04] is the one in control. And I believe
[47:06] he's directing my life.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; That's beautiful. When I look at what
[47:09] goes on in this world,
[47:12] if I didn't believe God was in control,
[47:14] man, I would have no hopes for nothing.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; I look at America, I look at the
[47:18] situation, I look at all the turmoil,
[47:20] all the stupidity, and all the things
[47:21] going on in Congress, and I realize if I
[47:24] was resting in my government, forget it.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; If I was resting on the things of the
[47:28] world for my future, forget it.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; And so, I've had to come in my own
[47:33] personal walk with God. I've had to
[47:35] believe. I've had to come to the place
[47:36] where I rest in him.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, I don't know what tomorrow
[47:41] will bring, but I know that God's
[47:43] already been there. If he's already been
[47:45] there, he knows what I'm going to face.
[47:47] If he knows what I'm going to face, if I
[47:49] trust him, he'll take me through it.
[47:50] Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. And that that's how I look at it.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham in in a
[47:55] statement, he said, "Why are people so
[47:57] tossed about?"
[47:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Christian faith is based
[48:00] solidly upon rest."
[48:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. A Christian is not tossed
[48:03] about. Christian doesn't run from place
[48:06] to place. Christian doesn't fuss and
[48:08] fume and worry about things. A Christian
[48:11] rests. It's all over. It's all finished
[48:13] for the believer at Calvary.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Is all the sickness may come and
[48:17] disappointment. He says, "But the
[48:19] Christians at rest knowing this that God
[48:22] is able to keep that which he has
[48:23] performed, knowing that no matter what
[48:25] the thing is or how it works, there's
[48:27] neither sickness nor sorrow nor death.
[48:30] there neither starvation or anything
[48:32] that can separate us from the love of
[48:33] God that's in Christ Jesus.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And to me, this is when I when I keep
[48:38] looking at this and what and and what
[48:41] what God's been dealing with me is
[48:44] there has to come a place within my life
[48:47] where I'm at rest.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; I don't worry about tomorrow. I don't
[48:50] worry about the things that may come. I
[48:52] don't worry about, you know, anything
[48:54] anymore.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. But I have I've tried to come to a
[48:57] place in my relationship with God where
[49:00] I rest in in him.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Because if I'm resting in him and I've
[49:04] asked him to guide and direct my life,
[49:06] then I and I and and I committed my life
[49:09] to him, then I have to believe that he
[49:12] will take care of me. He will watch over
[49:14] me. He will provide for me. He will do
[49:16] the things which which I I have asked
[49:18] him to.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; But just because I ask him to doesn't
[49:22] necessarily mean he's obligated to me to
[49:24] do it.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Sure. Okay, I can ask him and it's like
[49:27] my wife I I pray to God that he would
[49:30] allow me one more time to go back to
[49:32] India.
[49:34] Um situations being what it is and in
[49:37] flight and at our age we have our own
[49:40] little limitations and problems and
[49:42] shortcomings and stuff. But I asked Lord
[49:45] if you would be so gracious to allow me
[49:47] just one more time
[49:48] &gt;&gt; because it'll be 20 years that we've
[49:50] been ministering in India.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And I thought about that. that that
[49:53] that's a milestone that that's an
[49:55] anniversary whenever you want to do it.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to go back and see
[49:59] what God has allowed me to be a part of
[50:01] for for 20 years.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; But I had to come to the place where I
[50:06] where I where I where I reach the place
[50:08] where I would I would just take I would
[50:10] take the thing I would take my desire
[50:13] and said, "Lord, you have to work it
[50:15] out.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; You have to provide the means. You have
[50:18] to provide the health. You have to
[50:19] provide all of the other things which
[50:21] are going on in my life. and and even in
[50:24] the lives in in India
[50:25] &gt;&gt; that you have to work it out where
[50:27] you'll allow me to go and then be safe
[50:29] so I can go there and I can return
[50:31] safely.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; And as we began to think of this this I
[50:35] was trying to find how can I present
[50:38] this thought that you that God has
[50:40] placed within me and I went and I began
[50:43] to think of a couple of characters we
[50:45] have in the Bible and I thought about
[50:47] David.
[50:49] David to me is very interesting when I
[50:51] look at his life and the things that
[50:53] transpired in his life.
[50:56] David was out minding his own business,
[50:58] taking care of his dead sheep.
[51:00] God had taken Samuel and says, "You're
[51:02] going to go to David's household, his
[51:05] father, whatever, and you're going to
[51:07] anoint there the next king of Israel."
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. So Samuel takes the anointing oil.
[51:12] He goes to David's dad and says, "I need
[51:15] to see who your I need to have your sons
[51:17] presented before me." And so he sees
[51:20] this nice, strong, handsome, you know,
[51:22] stout fellow and and he say, "Oh man,
[51:24] that has to be the next king. I mean,
[51:26] look at the strength he has and stuff."
[51:28] &gt;&gt; And God says, "No, I've rejected him."
[51:31] And he went down every one of them until
[51:33] finally Saul looked around and says, "Is
[51:37] this all of them? Don't you have one
[51:39] more?" Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he's he's
[51:43] out there feeding some sheep.
[51:45] Well, can you bring him?
[51:48] Yeah. All right. You know, send a
[51:49] servant out to and I'm paraphrasing you.
[51:51] You allow me that. Been out out to go
[51:54] David and so the servant says, "Hey,
[51:56] David, your dad wants to see you." Okay.
[51:59] So, David, as soon as he walks in, God
[52:02] told S God told Samuel, "That's the
[52:04] one."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Yep. So here here's this crazy old man
[52:07] white hair takes his orange and ring and
[52:09] pours it all over David's head and says,
[52:11] "You are the next king of Israel."
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Really? Uh
[52:18] okay. What was David's reaction? Oh, I
[52:20] got to go see Saul. I have to learn how
[52:21] to be a king.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Now he went back to the sheep.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; But see, God be God from the beginning
[52:28] of time had ordained David to be the
[52:31] king of Israel.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:34] God had to bring things to pass in
[52:36] David's life that would bring him to
[52:39] that point where he would become what
[52:41] God had ordained for him.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; To be.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Why was all of a sudden David called to
[52:47] to go to before Saul and and play his
[52:50] heart?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Because God had put an evil spirit on
[52:53] Saul and Saul became disturbed and and
[52:56] so whenever David played, well, it would
[52:58] soothe him down and stuff like that.
[53:00] Well, that was that was fine. And then
[53:02] there was a battle with the Philistines.
[53:04] So David was sent back home to take care
[53:06] of the sheep and and David's brothers
[53:09] were sent off to the battle to to fight
[53:11] the Philistines. And well, his dad was
[53:14] concerned about how the battle was
[53:15] going. So he took David and gave him a
[53:17] bunch of honey and cakes and whatever
[53:19] else and, you know, go to where the
[53:21] battle was and see how see how your
[53:23] brothers are doing.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So David walks up there and just about
[53:26] the time he gets this big huge man
[53:29] Goliath. He stands up and makes his
[53:31] boat. He says, "Just send somebody to
[53:34] me."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; If I kill him, you serve me. If he kills
[53:38] me, we'll serve you. No problem. You
[53:41] know, why do we all have to battle like
[53:43] this?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And David heard this. But see, now God
[53:47] had prepared him for the battle.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; There was a lion came in one day to
[53:51] attack the sheep. David went after the
[53:54] lion. I wouldn't have, but David went
[53:56] after the lion to kill the animal.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and then another time all of a
[54:01] sudden a bear came in. Well, they tell
[54:03] me with bear one swipe with his hand and
[54:06] you know your head goes one direction,
[54:08] your body goes a different.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And uh but he went after the bear
[54:12] rescued the sheep. Yes.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And God delivered him.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; But see, God was preparing him for
[54:18] Goliath
[54:20] &gt;&gt; when all of a sudden Goliath made his
[54:22] bows and and then the anointing I if you
[54:24] will, I believe would have come upon
[54:26] David. So, who is this uncircumcised? We
[54:29] are the children of God.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; We are God. God has chosen us to be a
[54:34] representative upon the face of this
[54:36] earth to represent him, to glorify him.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; And so, what's this guy doing? He says,
[54:41] "You guys are afraid to fight this guy."
[54:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "All the promises rest in us."
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing rests in him.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; So, and so Saul tried to put his
[54:51] theological armor on him and he told him
[54:54] he can keep all of that. David went
[54:56] down. He got five little stones, put
[54:58] them in a shepherd's purse, and all of a
[55:00] sudden when Goliath came out and made
[55:02] the bows, David ran towards Goliath.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't try and duck and try and How
[55:08] are we going to do? No, he ran toward
[55:10] Goliath.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; He reached in. He took one little stone,
[55:13] put in the sling, swung it, and let it
[55:15] go.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; God had to direct the stone,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; but he's got it went right where it
[55:21] needed to go. Goliath fell down. David
[55:24] reached over to Goliath's sword and
[55:26] killed him.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; End of the story,
[55:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Well, all of a sudden, oh, this is
[55:31] great. You know, so then all of a sudden
[55:33] then the Israelites, the the the
[55:35] Israelite, the army, all of a sudden
[55:37] they got courage. So then they went and
[55:38] began to attack the Philistines and
[55:40] Okay. And so David then became part of
[55:43] of of the of the the group within within
[55:46] Saul's cabinet, if you will, wherever he
[55:49] would sit at the table. And so and so
[55:52] Saul took David and he made it so that
[55:54] David would lead the army.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; This is a young guy.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Uh probably just a late, you know,
[56:00] teenager would be my guess. I could be
[56:02] wrong on that. But David went out and
[56:05] God was with him and God would lead him
[56:07] and guide him. And then Saul became
[56:10] jealous
[56:11] &gt;&gt; and then David had to flee for his life.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Right? And so David went here and he
[56:16] went there and and and and but but the
[56:18] thing that you notice whenever you're
[56:20] reading about David, David listened to
[56:23] God.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; God li led him, guided him, provided for
[56:27] him. God directed him in the battles.
[56:29] God God pursu God preserved him and all
[56:31] of the other types of stuff. God was
[56:34] preparing him to go be and go and become
[56:38] what God God had ordained for him to be.
[56:40] Mhm.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; There was one time when David with they
[56:44] were hid away in a cave and W Saul had
[56:46] to go in and do his business so to speak
[56:49] and uh David was there with his with a
[56:52] lot of his men.
[56:54] Been easy to kill him.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; In fact, one of his servants is just let
[57:00] me go. He says I only have to smite him
[57:02] once.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Yep.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, David's reaction was quite
[57:06] different than what you would expect.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; David in In 1st Samuel 26, he go David
[57:12] goes on. He says, "And David said unto
[57:14] Abashai, destroy him not for who can
[57:17] stretch forth his hand against the
[57:19] Lord's anointed and be guiltless."
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; David said, "Therefore, that as the Lord
[57:24] liveth, the Lord shall smite him, or his
[57:27] day shall come to die, or he shall
[57:29] descend into battle and perish."
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; The Lord forbid that I should stretch
[57:34] forth my hand against the Lord's
[57:36] anointed.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I pray thee, take now thy
[57:38] spear and that that his bolster and
[57:40] cruise of water and you know let him be
[57:42] fired. But see this was David's
[57:44] attitude.
[57:46] If I am to be the king,
[57:49] I will do it in God's timing.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; When I am to be a if I'm to be anointed
[57:54] king and I'm to be and I am to rule the
[57:56] nation of Israel, God will provide the
[57:59] way. God will open the door. or God will
[58:01] do whatever is necessary where I can
[58:04] ascend to that throne where I can become
[58:06] what God had ordained for me to be
[58:08] without me trying to accomplish it on my
[58:10] own.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And sometime we have to look at our
[58:13] lives. God has ordained every one of us.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; For a purpose,
[58:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:18] &gt;&gt; We don't know what that purpose is. A
[58:20] lot of us don't know what they are. I I
[58:22] had never desired to be a preacher. My
[58:25] my my younger brother hadn't either.
[58:27] Look at him what he does now. Um, but
[58:30] each of us, God has led us. God has
[58:32] guided us. God has opened doors. He's
[58:33] shut doors. He's He's guided us in
[58:35] different directions and done what he
[58:37] has done. Because, see, God had a plan.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And now I'm trying to fulfill what I
[58:43] believe his plan for my life is.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's another there's another
[58:47] person that when I look at Joseph, it's
[58:50] an interesting to me. It's an
[58:51] interesting story. Joseph was a dreamer.
[58:55] God gave him a couple of dreams.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, yeah." He said, he said,
[58:59] "What's going to, you know, uh let's
[59:00] see." Yeah. Okay. Joseph dreamed a
[59:03] dream. And and he told his brethren, and
[59:05] they hated him. And he said unto them,
[59:08] "Here, I pray that this dream that I've
[59:10] dreamed, for behold, we were binding
[59:12] sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheep
[59:14] rose, and also stood upright, and
[59:16] behold, your sheav just stood around
[59:18] about and bowed to me."
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And his brethren said, "So shalt thou
[59:23] reign over us, or shalt thou indeed have
[59:26] dominion over us?" And they hated him
[59:28] yet the more for his dreams and for his
[59:31] words. And yet he dreamed another dream
[59:32] and told his brethren. It says, "And I
[59:34] have dreamed and dreamed more. And
[59:35] behold, the sun and the moon, the 11
[59:37] stars bowed to me."
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; He told him his father and his brethren,
[59:42] even his father rebuked him.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; True.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; So he has his dreams.
[59:49] His brothers hated him. His dad even
[59:53] rebuked him.
[59:55] How is it that there's going to come a
[59:57] time in in in in in in in in in Joseph's
[1:00:00] life that his father and mother and his
[1:00:03] brethren are going to bow before him,
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:00:09] Joseph had no idea what he was going to
[1:00:11] have to go through
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; to get where God had ordained for him to
[1:00:16] be.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; He went out to his dad was asking see
[1:00:19] how the your brothers are doing. They
[1:00:21] got he got out there and so they said,
[1:00:22] "Hey, here's that dreamer of dreams."
[1:00:24] They took him, stuck him in a pit
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; and one of his brother, one of his
[1:00:28] brothers said, "Hey, let's not kill
[1:00:29] him." So they all of a sudden a caravan
[1:00:31] came by. Ah, hey, let's just sell him
[1:00:32] into slavery. So they sold him into
[1:00:34] slavery. He got down into Egypt.
[1:00:37] He was bought by Potterer and then he
[1:00:40] Potterer gave him their management of
[1:00:42] his house and he was Joseph was doing a
[1:00:45] good job
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; but Potterer's wife all of a sudden
[1:00:49] decided she wanted to have an affair
[1:00:51] with him
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; and so she accused him later on of
[1:00:54] having an affair that threw him into
[1:00:56] prison right so it went from bad to
[1:00:58] worse and so there he was in the prison
[1:01:00] he couldn't do anything at all I mean he
[1:01:02] know I mean he he was I don't think he
[1:01:05] was bound in chains but here Again, it
[1:01:07] wasn't the best of conditions.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Lo and behold, a little while later on,
[1:01:11] all of a sudden, two of Pharaoh's
[1:01:13] servants came by. They were in the
[1:01:15] prison and Joseph was checking on him
[1:01:17] one day and says, "Hey, you guys look
[1:01:19] sad. What's the problem with here?" So,
[1:01:21] well, we've dreamed dreams and there's
[1:01:23] nobody around here that can interpret
[1:01:24] them. He said, "Well, tell me the dream.
[1:01:26] Maybe God will show show me the
[1:01:28] interpretation." So, the butler says,
[1:01:30] "Yeah, yeah." He said, "I had dreamed
[1:01:32] this dream." And he gave the I don't
[1:01:34] have it written down here, but he gave
[1:01:35] the dream and and Joseph gave in the
[1:01:37] interior. Oh, yeah. After three days, he
[1:01:39] says, "You're going to be restored as a
[1:01:41] butler."
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; You're going to be restored to your
[1:01:43] position with with Pharaoh.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And the other guy was was the was the
[1:01:47] baker.
[1:01:49] So, the baker says, "Hey, well, that
[1:01:50] sounds good. Maybe he'll interpret
[1:01:52] mine."
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; So, he gave him his dream. And well, his
[1:01:55] wasn't the interpretation wasn't as
[1:01:57] nice. He says, "Yeah, yeah. in three
[1:01:59] days your head's going to be removed
[1:02:00] from you and the birds are going to
[1:02:01] whatever like that you're basically
[1:02:03] you're going to be a dead man
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; and then Joseph asked the butler he says
[1:02:07] when you get to before Pharaoh
[1:02:10] tell him about me I'm stuck here
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and I have done nothing wrong
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; and so the butler he was restored to his
[1:02:17] position and forgot all about Joseph
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; but then there came the time when
[1:02:21] Pharaoh had a dream
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; he got his astrologers and all of his
[1:02:26] other magicians whatever ever.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; And uh he told him the dream and uh oh,
[1:02:32] we don't we don't know, you know. And so
[1:02:35] then the brother says, "Hey, when you
[1:02:37] had me in prison, there was a guy in the
[1:02:39] prison there and he interpreted my dream
[1:02:41] for for me." And it came across just
[1:02:43] like like you he had told me.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Well, let's go get him. So they took
[1:02:48] Joseph. They he had to put he had to
[1:02:51] they had to dress him up as a priest.
[1:02:52] They had to jay build his hair, put um
[1:02:55] clean clothes on him and then he was
[1:02:57] ushered in before Pharaoh and Pharaoh
[1:02:58] told him the dream and and and so the
[1:03:01] dream was given to him twice. One of
[1:03:03] them you got seven years when the cows
[1:03:05] would be nice and fat and everything
[1:03:07] like that and then all of a sudden
[1:03:09] there'd be seven years and all of a
[1:03:10] sudden the cattle are just going to be
[1:03:11] skinnier than skinny. And then there was
[1:03:14] another seven there was another rice
[1:03:16] another was another crop of corn nice
[1:03:20] big rich you know taste tasty ones and
[1:03:23] then seven years after that it looked I
[1:03:25] mean blasted with mildew and dust and
[1:03:27] everything else
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; and so Pharaoh or so Joseph interpreted
[1:03:31] these dreams.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh began to realize if a man
[1:03:36] can interpret dreams by God this is an
[1:03:39] important person.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he made Joseph um second in
[1:03:43] command, if you will, of all of Egypt.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And then he he he gave him a a wife of
[1:03:50] one of the other priests. And so then he
[1:03:52] started having his kids and settle down.
[1:03:54] And in some regard, in some ways, Joseph
[1:03:56] probably forgot the dreams.
[1:03:59] But when all of a sudden his brothers
[1:04:01] came because they needed food,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; when they bowed before him, the dream
[1:04:07] came back to Joseph.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. and said this is how God is going
[1:04:11] to fulfill the dream.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; That he had given to me.
[1:04:16] He had to go, excuse the expression, he
[1:04:19] had to go through hell to get to where
[1:04:22] God needed him to be.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; To be able to fulfill what God had given
[1:04:26] him the dreams of.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Right? And we do not know what we have
[1:04:31] to what we have gone through or are
[1:04:34] going through in order to get us to the
[1:04:36] place where we can rest in what God has
[1:04:39] called us to be.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet.
[1:04:45] When I was when I was in the Baptist
[1:04:47] church, I was a sinner saved by grace.
[1:04:49] Emphasis on sinner.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Am I a sinner
[1:04:53] saved by grace?" Yes, I will acknowledge
[1:04:55] that. But brother Bradom says you're not
[1:05:00] you're more than just a sinner saved by
[1:05:02] grace.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God which has been
[1:05:05] fully restored to your rightful
[1:05:07] position.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; As a son.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And that it's a it takes a huge
[1:05:13] transition in thinking to be able to
[1:05:16] acknowledge and realize what I am in
[1:05:19] God.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I brother Brandham in one of his
[1:05:22] one of his sermons he says you know do
[1:05:24] you realize if you are a if you are a
[1:05:26] son of God you were a part of God
[1:05:30] placed a part of him in you.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; When God placed his seed in you that was
[1:05:35] a part of God that was dwelling in you
[1:05:38] and that seed of God was supposed to
[1:05:40] sprout and bring forth the life and the
[1:05:42] life of that seed is God. So we what
[1:05:47] what are we to become? We are to become
[1:05:48] an image. We are becoming manifestation
[1:05:51] of the very God that we worship.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; And that's a huge change in in my
[1:05:56] thought processes.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; But we have it's it's like when uh okay
[1:06:01] there's a law of redemption.
[1:06:03] If if your uncle or whatever like that
[1:06:06] decides to have favor with you and so he
[1:06:08] goes down to the guy that you sold
[1:06:10] yourself to and he says, "Hey, I want to
[1:06:13] I'm going to set my my my c my my nephew
[1:06:15] free." Okay. So, well, how much do I owe
[1:06:18] you to do that? Well, it will cost you
[1:06:20] so much. All of the requirements fell
[1:06:23] upon the one doing the redeeming,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; not on the one being redeemed.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Once that person was redeemed, he was
[1:06:32] free.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; He was free to go back to his to his
[1:06:36] house. He was free to have his village
[1:06:37] or his his yard, his his his plot of
[1:06:41] land. He was free to go back to his wife
[1:06:42] and his kids. He was free.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was no restrictions on
[1:06:47] him. Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to be going back
[1:06:49] to? We're supposed to be going back to
[1:06:51] Eden.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; We are supposed to be going back to what
[1:06:54] we were in God before there was the
[1:06:56] fall.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Everything Adam lost as a result of the
[1:07:00] fall has been fully restored to us.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And that's huge.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; When Adam was first formed, he was a
[1:07:09] part of God. God took a part of himself.
[1:07:11] He created Adam. Adam in first part he
[1:07:14] was he was on a theophony form.
[1:07:16] Eventually God took that theophony form
[1:07:18] and brought it to the brought it to
[1:07:19] earth and he gave him rulership over the
[1:07:22] earth.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; We also are to have rulership over the
[1:07:27] earth.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; You say well how does this work? Well if
[1:07:31] I look at when when you look at the life
[1:07:33] of a prophet a prophet not only delivers
[1:07:36] the messages of God his life is an
[1:07:40] example to the people.
[1:07:43] when what God because of the sins of the
[1:07:45] people Isaiah had to walk naked for
[1:07:48] three years.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; I would find that embarrassing.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Um but then you look at Ezekiel, Ezekiel
[1:07:54] had to lay on one side for 300 and
[1:07:56] something days and then he had to lay on
[1:07:58] the other side for another 400 days or
[1:08:00] whatever and and he could only drink so
[1:08:02] much water and the food that he got to
[1:08:04] eat had to be mixed with with manure.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; I would find that distasteful.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. But he was an example to the people
[1:08:13] of what they were going to go through.
[1:08:16] The example of the judgment God was
[1:08:17] going to bring upon them.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet to tell us who we
[1:08:23] are.
[1:08:25] But and when I began to relate to that,
[1:08:27] you know, the life that he lived is for
[1:08:30] us to emulate.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; He I see in his life what I am to
[1:08:36] become.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] He is the first person that I can look
[1:08:40] at that I believe came to adoption.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; But God had to try him. When you look at
[1:08:47] brother Bam's life, he was a renegade. I
[1:08:50] mean, he he would he would have been in
[1:08:52] prison for murder if if he God had not
[1:08:54] intervened. He got there was a time when
[1:08:57] his his wife and children were taken
[1:08:58] from him and he just wanted to commit
[1:09:00] suicide. But God had placed a gift in
[1:09:02] him. But eventually when when brother
[1:09:05] Brandham he over time he began to
[1:09:07] realize because God showed him visions
[1:09:09] he says well this is how God speaks to
[1:09:11] prophets and therefore he understood who
[1:09:13] he was in that regard.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And then when God began to reveal the
[1:09:16] secrets of the heart then he began to
[1:09:18] understand well now this is also this
[1:09:20] was a furtherance of his ministry.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; In 1960 brother Brandon Re looked at all
[1:09:27] the visions God had given to him and
[1:09:29] realized we're at the end time.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's when he preached the
[1:09:33] church ages.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's when God spoke to him and says,
[1:09:37] "Now look at Malachi 4."
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Then he began, in my opinion, he began
[1:09:42] to understand he was the messenger to
[1:09:44] this age.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; When when I listened to Brother Rad's
[1:09:48] earlier years, he had high regards for
[1:09:49] Billy Graham.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; He and I and I can go back and I can
[1:09:54] substantiate now if you want, but he he
[1:09:56] thought that Billy Graham was to be the
[1:09:58] messenger to the age. He says, "Look
[1:10:00] at," he says, "You look at John the
[1:10:01] Baptist. There was no miracles, but he
[1:10:03] preached the word." Well, look at Billy
[1:10:04] Graham. He There's no miracles, but he's
[1:10:06] preaching the word. And that's how
[1:10:07] Brother Bradom tied that that together.
[1:10:10] But yet, God had a different plan.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; God needed a man totally under his
[1:10:15] control.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to come to the
[1:10:19] place in his life and relationship with
[1:10:22] Jesus Christ where he literally rested
[1:10:25] in God.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; He could stand. He said, "You know, the
[1:10:28] the the the gift that I have is my
[1:10:32] ability to get myself out of the way
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; so he can use me."
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; He said, he gets up there and then and
[1:10:38] and all of a sudden, God takes
[1:10:40] possession of his body and and and God
[1:10:43] speaks through him and tells the person
[1:10:45] in in the prayer line. So like this is
[1:10:47] this this this and then Brother Brad
[1:10:49] shakes his head and he says, "Is what he
[1:10:52] said? Is that true? I have to listen to
[1:10:53] the tapes because I don't know what was
[1:10:55] said."
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, but then over time, God
[1:10:59] changed it over where brother Brandham,
[1:11:01] even though he had yield himself to the
[1:11:03] spirit of God in him, yet now all of a
[1:11:06] sudden he was still in possession of his
[1:11:08] faculties. He he could listen. He could
[1:11:10] he could understand. Even though God was
[1:11:12] using him, he he we he did not go
[1:11:15] totally blank for lack of a better way
[1:11:17] of putting it.
[1:11:19] But see, then when we get to the church
[1:11:21] age, when we get to the seals,
[1:11:24] brother Brandham says when the when the
[1:11:25] when the when the when the seventh angel
[1:11:27] begins to sound, he says the mystery of
[1:11:29] God's to be finished.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; He said he he said he he said the seals
[1:11:36] could not be opened until the till the
[1:11:38] church ages had finished.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:41] And so that and so he says the seventh
[1:11:43] angel's message began at the seals.
[1:11:48] telling and what was the seal he's
[1:11:50] trying to tell the bride this is who you
[1:11:52] are
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; we had brother Brandham brother Brandham
[1:11:57] in different places he says you know
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ never performed a miracle
[1:12:02] he says it was the god in him
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says I've never
[1:12:06] performed a miracle either I was just
[1:12:08] standing there when he did it
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; he learned to he learned to take his
[1:12:13] body and yield it so to God so God could
[1:12:16] use him.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I I some people had somebody had
[1:12:20] mentioned we were in different place and
[1:12:23] somebody Oh, yeah. When you look at
[1:12:24] Jesus Christ, he was all human.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Well, in one sense, yes, he was. But the
[1:12:31] other sense, it was God dwelling in him.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And I'd always wondered, how did God
[1:12:37] deal with the humanity that he dwelt in?
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ was every bit man.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He had self-will. He had desires like
[1:12:47] any other man has desires. He wanted to
[1:12:49] have a family. He wanted to have a
[1:12:51] house. He wanted to have clothes. He
[1:12:52] wanted to have But but but brother
[1:12:54] Banner made an interesting statement. He
[1:12:56] says Jesus Jesus Christ took his will
[1:13:01] and gave it to the father.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; He totally submitted. He He did not
[1:13:06] exercise his will.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He totally gave himself to God and let
[1:13:11] God do what God wanted to do through
[1:13:14] him.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like in and sometimes, you know,
[1:13:16] when when you look at self, so some
[1:13:18] decisions are easy.
[1:13:21] Tells his disciples, you know, we have
[1:13:22] to go down to Jericho. Oh man, Jericho's
[1:13:25] a long walk. It's kind of hot out. What
[1:13:27] do you Why are we going to go down to
[1:13:29] Jer? It's hotter down there. You realize
[1:13:31] it's hotter down there.
[1:13:33] Well, God has told me to go to Jericho,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll go to Jericho. Well, there
[1:13:40] was this short little man had to climb
[1:13:42] up in a tree. Yeah,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; because that was God's seed.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus gets under the tree, looks up.
[1:13:49] Hey, Zakius, come on down. I'm going to
[1:13:51] have lunch with you today.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. You know, and then there's another
[1:13:56] there was a blind man there. And all of
[1:13:59] a sudden, he heard Jesus was walking by
[1:14:01] and and and he began to cry out. And I
[1:14:04] think brother Bad made mention of the
[1:14:06] fact nobody Jesus Christ could have not
[1:14:08] have heard his boy his cry in his ears.
[1:14:12] But yet there was a cry that reached him
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and then they asked Barnabas
[1:14:18] to come and and what Jesus asked what
[1:14:20] would you like? I would like to have my
[1:14:23] sight back.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Fine. Jesus prayed his sight came back.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. because there was another person
[1:14:29] that God through through the min through
[1:14:32] Jesus Christ had to minister to because
[1:14:35] that was God's child. Amen. Another time
[1:14:38] he said we have to go by way of Samaria.
[1:14:41] Oh man. Hey, they hate us. They're
[1:14:43] Samaritans. We're Jew. We We don't have
[1:14:45] any relationship. No, this is not a good
[1:14:48] idea, boy. But Jesus says, "No, we're
[1:14:50] going."
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Well, if you insist, I guess we'll go.
[1:14:56] They go down there. They went in to try
[1:14:57] and get some food. And meanwhile, Jesus
[1:15:00] was sitting there and then this this
[1:15:01] lady came in for to get some water. And
[1:15:05] all of a sudden, God Jesus began to
[1:15:07] speak to the lady and then he contacted
[1:15:11] like brothers, he contacted her spirit
[1:15:13] and realized what her problem was. Go
[1:15:15] get your husband. Well, I don't have
[1:15:17] one. Well, you had however many. The one
[1:15:19] you're living with now is not yours.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; But see, she was a seed of God.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] God needed to reach her and the only way
[1:15:28] he could reach her was through the body
[1:15:31] he lived in in Jesus Christ.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; But see when we go and go about the our
[1:15:36] lives that we live and and interact with
[1:15:39] the pe different people, do you
[1:15:41] understand that God through you is
[1:15:43] trying to reach out to his seed,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; He's trying to reach out to that which
[1:15:47] was a part of him from the beginning.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And the only vessels he can use is you.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:55] Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; You are his hands. You're his feet.
[1:15:57] You're his mouth, his eyes, ears. You
[1:16:00] God dwells in you.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And he and brother Brandham says he
[1:16:04] needs the same preeminence in you that
[1:16:06] he had in Jesus Christ.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And because and because he had total
[1:16:10] preeminence in Jesus Christ, whatever
[1:16:13] God wanted to do, he had to use the body
[1:16:15] that God now dwelt in, we call Jesus
[1:16:17] Christ. And he had to go here and he had
[1:16:20] to go there and he had to in order to be
[1:16:21] able to minister. Right? Would I look at
[1:16:23] brother Bam? Brother Bam went here and
[1:16:25] there and stuff like that because here
[1:16:27] God dwelt in that body
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; to fulfill God's will for the lives of
[1:16:32] the people that he was going to interact
[1:16:34] with. Brother Bham talks about he oh
[1:16:36] what you see up here in the on the
[1:16:37] platform this is nothing. He says I'm
[1:16:39] I'll be at home minding my own business
[1:16:41] and God will say I want you to be at a
[1:16:42] certain certain city at a certain
[1:16:44] certain time on a certain certain corner
[1:16:46] and and this other person is going to
[1:16:47] come by. This is how they will look. I
[1:16:49] want you to to take them. This is the
[1:16:51] problem they have. I want you to
[1:16:52] minister to them and hight tail it out
[1:16:53] of town.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, he gets there.
[1:16:56] He gets to the city. He gets in the
[1:16:58] street corner. He's there at the time
[1:17:00] God had appointed and all of a sudden
[1:17:02] the one he talked about was going to
[1:17:03] come, the person came, brother Brandham
[1:17:05] talked to them and he doesn't relate a
[1:17:07] whole lot on that. But he prayed for the
[1:17:09] person and all of a sudden when the
[1:17:10] person turned around to thank brother
[1:17:11] Brandham, Brother Brandham was gone.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; It wasn't about brother Brandham.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; It's not about us.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Right. If we could ever get the come to
[1:17:22] the realization it's not about who we
[1:17:24] are.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; It's about who he is.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; It's not what we do for God. It's what
[1:17:29] we allow him to do through us.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; It's nothing to do with us.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; We have to learn to totally yield
[1:17:37] ourselves to him so he can accomplish
[1:17:39] what he wants to accomplish through our
[1:17:42] lives.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; We go and we begin we begin to
[1:17:51] We understand it in everything that God
[1:17:53] has timing. God has a timing for
[1:17:55] everything. In in Galatians 4, he says,
[1:17:57] "But when the fullness of time has come,
[1:17:59] God sent forth a son, made every woman
[1:18:01] made under the law for the purpose to
[1:18:04] redeem them that were under the law,
[1:18:07] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:18:09] sons."
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And that's to happen at this day.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. And because you are sons, God sent
[1:18:19] forth the spirit of a son into your
[1:18:21] hearts
[1:18:22] where you begin to understand God is
[1:18:25] your father.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; My parents gave me the body I live in. I
[1:18:31] was not I but I was born here by the
[1:18:34] will of God
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; because I God had ordained for me to be
[1:18:39] alive and in in in in this body in this
[1:18:43] in this time because he has a purpose
[1:18:45] for me going
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um
[1:18:49] I never would have chosen India to be a
[1:18:52] missionary to.
[1:18:55] We went there totally ignorant of what I
[1:18:58] was getting into the middle of.
[1:19:00] Um 20 years ago,
[1:19:03] India was a lot different than the way
[1:19:05] it is now. I mean, yeah, I won't go into
[1:19:08] details, but God allowed me to become
[1:19:12] part of something. We we helped build
[1:19:14] some churches, but later, but what we
[1:19:17] have done, what we've concentrated on
[1:19:18] the most in the last probably 15 years
[1:19:22] is taking the messages of brother
[1:19:23] Brandham and having them translated from
[1:19:26] from English into the Telugu language.
[1:19:29] Right now we have 380
[1:19:32] messages which are available in the
[1:19:33] Telugu language to the
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; good. Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And when I went two years ago Yeah. Um I
[1:19:42] was curious
[1:19:44] how if what we had started is it going
[1:19:47] to continue? Is there enough momentum in
[1:19:50] what I had started
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; through God's help?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Is it is it is it going to continue on
[1:19:55] or is it going to dry up and just go
[1:19:57] away? Um there's enough momentum the
[1:20:00] translation work still is going ongoing.
[1:20:04] Then I was curious the churches that I
[1:20:06] had worked with are they financially
[1:20:08] stable and the other one is of the
[1:20:11] messages that have been translated how
[1:20:13] available are they to the people that
[1:20:15] speak that language?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And we the different outlying churches
[1:20:20] we went to we saw they had books
[1:20:22] translated into tele. They were
[1:20:25] available to the people that could read.
[1:20:27] If you had a cell phone, you can
[1:20:30] download from from um Cloverdale on the
[1:20:33] web, you can download everything which
[1:20:35] is available in the Telugu language.
[1:20:37] Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; So it's available and and as the
[1:20:40] children had grown in grown over the
[1:20:42] years, now they they have jobs and so
[1:20:45] the the children of the ministers now
[1:20:48] have are able to contribute to the
[1:20:50] church. So that the church is basically
[1:20:53] it's financially stable because of of
[1:20:55] you know God has has allowed that to be
[1:20:58] there.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Good. Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; But any but we have but we have my my
[1:21:02] thing is is
[1:21:05] God I can look back in my life and I can
[1:21:08] see where God has directed me.
[1:21:11] I I I had not chosen this path at all.
[1:21:16] In fact, a lot of ways I I never would
[1:21:18] have. I mean I had my own ideas of what
[1:21:21] I wanted to do and stuff. But yet I can
[1:21:23] look back and I can see the hand of God
[1:21:26] in the things which were doing.
[1:21:29] And I marvel that God was has been able
[1:21:31] to keep me. He's able to supply for me.
[1:21:34] He is able to lead and guide me in spite
[1:21:36] of myself to be able to to accomplish I
[1:21:40] think what he has wanted me to do over
[1:21:42] time.
[1:21:43] But I I began to study the the uh
[1:21:48] since I'm going to be ministering at
[1:21:50] Freddy Grace Church probably about five
[1:21:52] or six services, I wanted a series
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; and to come up with a new ser sermon.
[1:21:58] Yeah, it's difficult. And so I started
[1:22:01] studying the tabernacle and so I'm
[1:22:04] trying to inter relate to the different
[1:22:06] ways constructed.
[1:22:08] There's a brother though that I was
[1:22:10] listening to a couple nights ago
[1:22:13] and he took the tabernacle, the example
[1:22:15] of the tabernacle and and he he he
[1:22:19] brought a thought process that I never
[1:22:20] would have thought of. He says, you
[1:22:23] know, when when a person and he
[1:22:25] basically is following the the um the
[1:22:28] plan of salvation, if you will, we have
[1:22:30] to go justification, sanctification,
[1:22:32] baptism, Holy Spirit. Anyway, he says,
[1:22:34] you know, when a sinner when a sinner
[1:22:36] wants to wants to approach God, he has
[1:22:39] to go to the gate. It's on the east. And
[1:22:42] when with God, everything's in type. The
[1:22:44] sun rises in the east and sets in the
[1:22:46] west. And so the gate that they have
[1:22:48] have to enter into is on the east.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Anyway, but in order for you to accept
[1:22:54] Jesus Christ, in order for you to get
[1:22:56] into the into the outer courtyard,
[1:22:58] you have to bring a sacrifice. You have
[1:23:00] to you have to acknowledge that you are
[1:23:02] a sinner. You have to acknowledge that
[1:23:04] the grace of God that has provided
[1:23:06] sacrifice for you and only and you offer
[1:23:09] the sacrifice and you identify with the
[1:23:11] sacrifice are you allowed into the
[1:23:13] courtyard. Mhm.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And he says, "When we when we gather
[1:23:16] together in church," Yeah. It's a group
[1:23:18] effort. We all gather together, we sing
[1:23:21] songs, we interact with each other, we
[1:23:23] fellowship with each other, all this
[1:23:24] other kind of stuff.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; And you have to go through a process.
[1:23:27] You have to go through justification.
[1:23:29] You justification is acknowledging that
[1:23:31] you are a sinner. Yes. And then watch
[1:23:33] the sacrifice that that you had brought.
[1:23:35] You have to watch it die. You have to
[1:23:36] watch it be consumed upon the altar.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] When you're in the courtyard, the
[1:23:42] courtyard when you look at it, the the
[1:23:44] walls are about seven feet tall and it's
[1:23:46] all white around which speaks of being a
[1:23:49] righteousness. Okay?
[1:23:52] And so when you're in the courtyard, God
[1:23:54] views you as righteous because you are
[1:23:56] you you have come to a relationship with
[1:23:59] God where God regards you as as
[1:24:01] righteous.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But if if you are a priest, you have to
[1:24:05] go through a process.
[1:24:07] You have to be washed and you you have
[1:24:09] to be cleansed. You have to have blood
[1:24:11] sprinkled on you before you can enter
[1:24:14] into the next into the into the next
[1:24:16] next court which is which is inside the
[1:24:18] the tabernacle itself.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle is um 9 ft no almost 14t
[1:24:25] tall. It's double the height.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; So when you're in the outside you look
[1:24:30] you can see the tabernacle there and it
[1:24:32] looks uglier than ugly. I mean
[1:24:35] um they say in corpus skins or something
[1:24:38] like that anyway
[1:24:40] but you when you enter into there it's a
[1:24:43] very limited group that goes into the
[1:24:45] holy place and there you have different
[1:24:48] obligations and different things that
[1:24:49] you want to go through but the thing
[1:24:52] that struck me when the brother was was
[1:24:54] ministering he says you know what God is
[1:24:57] wanting us to do is to go behind the
[1:25:00] last veil. Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; There you only go behind the last veil
[1:25:06] individually.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; You don't go in there as a group.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; When you enter into that, you enter into
[1:25:15] the very presence of God himself.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And at that point, that that is the
[1:25:20] journey that God is trying to get us to
[1:25:22] go through.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Often times, yeah, we sit in the outer
[1:25:27] court. Yeah. That's fine. as as as as
[1:25:29] believers in Jesus Christ, we are
[1:25:31] kingdom of priests. Okay? So, we enter
[1:25:33] into the holy place.
[1:25:35] But to make that last veil,
[1:25:39] you have it. It takes a it takes a it
[1:25:42] takes a full commitment for one, but
[1:25:45] also when you get into there, it's not
[1:25:48] about you. It's all about him.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. When you're in there, it's
[1:25:52] like, okay, when I look at the ark, how
[1:25:54] could they put how could they store
[1:25:56] enough food to feed all of those animals
[1:25:58] for a year?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a lot of food.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:26:05] but I you take this for whatever you
[1:26:07] want. When Moses was up on the mountain,
[1:26:10] he was there for 40 days.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't eat. He didn't drink.
[1:26:15] What sustained him,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; He was in God's presence.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In God's presence, he takes care
[1:26:22] of it all.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; All the physical needs that you have in
[1:26:25] your body,
[1:26:27] it's already taken care of.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And I look at the ark in the same kind
[1:26:30] of way. That may be all wrong, but
[1:26:32] anyway.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; But when we when we get to the place
[1:26:35] where we go behind the last veil,
[1:26:39] we are entering into the very presence
[1:26:42] of God himself.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But to do that the thing that you
[1:26:46] have to be able to understand is it's
[1:26:49] all everything you do with God is by
[1:26:51] faith.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; When we to go behind the last veil,
[1:26:56] there has to be a relationship between
[1:26:59] you and you and God that that allows you
[1:27:02] to go behind that veil.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; The high priest is the only one that
[1:27:07] could go behind the veil. I think in one
[1:27:09] place the scripture says we enter in
[1:27:12] behind the veil through the body of
[1:27:13] Jesus Christ.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; So you have to be in Christ. You have to
[1:27:17] have a relationship. It can't be a
[1:27:19] Sunday morning social function. That's
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; No, there has to come to the place where
[1:27:24] God is a reality to you. And when you go
[1:27:27] behind the last veil, you're entering
[1:27:29] into the very presence of God himself.
[1:27:33] And that that's when you can begin to
[1:27:35] commune with him.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; And it's an open communion. It's it's
[1:27:41] not a, you know, praying, I hope God
[1:27:42] he'll hear my voice. No, you're actually
[1:27:45] there in his presence. And when you're
[1:27:47] in his presence and and you and and and
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; when you when you and how can I say this
[1:27:55] David, God ordained him to become a
[1:27:57] king. He had to go through a process to
[1:28:00] get to be king. Mhm.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; U Joseph had to go through a process in
[1:28:05] order for the visions of the the dreams
[1:28:07] that God had given him. Brother Bradom
[1:28:10] talks about us as the bride.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He says we have to come to the place we
[1:28:15] have to come to a place where we are
[1:28:17] literally resting in God. To me that
[1:28:21] talks about going behind the last veil.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. I go behind the last veil and I am
[1:28:27] totally dependent upon him for my life
[1:28:29] because he that life that presence is
[1:28:32] what has to sustain me.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And so when I when I it's it's not
[1:28:37] always easy but there's a desire in my
[1:28:40] heart to get to the place where I can so
[1:28:42] dwell in his presence until I no longer
[1:28:45] am concerned about me.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; I'm just concerned about what he would
[1:28:48] desire for me to do for him. Okay.
[1:28:52] Brother Venom says he swore by himself.
[1:28:56] Um he said he says listen I'm going to
[1:28:57] say say something. Look he said faith is
[1:29:00] unconscious.
[1:29:02] Amen. You believe it. I've learned but
[1:29:04] that over the years of travel around the
[1:29:06] world and seeing people in all different
[1:29:08] walks of life. He said but faith is
[1:29:10] unconscious. You got faith and you don't
[1:29:13] even know it. Yes. So to the ability to
[1:29:15] enter in behind the veil, you have the
[1:29:17] ability, you have the faith to do this,
[1:29:20] but you have to will to do the will of
[1:29:22] God. Amen. But he goes on here, Jesus
[1:29:24] Christ, no matter if he was in a storm,
[1:29:27] the gale is knocking the boat from one
[1:29:28] side to the other or he's standing in
[1:29:30] the face of a mess of demons, if he was
[1:29:33] hanging anywhere, never moved him, he
[1:29:35] walked right along just as calm and
[1:29:37] quiet as he could be. Why? He was simply
[1:29:41] unconscious of fear. anything around
[1:29:43] him. That's right. Whether it was going
[1:29:45] to happen or whether it wasn't going to
[1:29:47] happen. He knowed it was going to happen
[1:29:49] because God said so.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, I wonder if I prayed
[1:29:52] through. I wonder if I fasted long
[1:29:54] enough. I wondered this or that." He
[1:29:56] just walked right on unconscious. That's
[1:29:58] right. He believed that God said he
[1:30:01] believed what God said was truth and the
[1:30:04] words must be fulfilled. He know that
[1:30:06] his life was to fulfill them. That's
[1:30:08] right. And so I look at that and I I
[1:30:11] look at that we should we I believe we
[1:30:14] should be able to come to a relationship
[1:30:16] with God
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; where we so trust in him. We realize
[1:30:20] that everything God's word will be
[1:30:22] fulfilled.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if we believe it to be
[1:30:26] impossible or any anything else. No. I
[1:30:29] mean you can look at what's going on in
[1:30:30] our government.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Why is Trump president?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Not that I'm necessarily I'm okay. Stay
[1:30:37] with the way of politics.
[1:30:39] But we have to begin to understand. I
[1:30:41] believe God put him there for a reason.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Why are they going to elect a Muslim to
[1:30:46] be that to be the mayor of New York
[1:30:48] City,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That is unheard of,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; New York City is the center of
[1:30:53] capitalism.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; This guy is a communist.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Capitalism does not go with with with
[1:31:00] communism.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, these are as different as you
[1:31:04] know, black is as from white,
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; right? It's going to be interesting
[1:31:08] Tuesday. Okay.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; But we have to understand God has a
[1:31:12] plan. He will fulfill that plan.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what we say. It
[1:31:17] doesn't matter what we think. It doesn't
[1:31:18] even matter how the people vote to a
[1:31:20] large extent because God has a plan. God
[1:31:23] will fulfill his word.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; But see, we God is going to fulfill his
[1:31:29] word in us.
[1:31:31] In order for him to fulfill his word in
[1:31:34] us, he has to have the preeminence.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He had the preeminence in Jesus Christ.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; God took his Jesus Christ took his will
[1:31:43] in the flesh and gave it to God.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; So he never did his will. He always did
[1:31:49] the will of the father.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; The place it came to where where he did
[1:31:53] not want to do the will of the father
[1:31:55] was at Gethsemane.
[1:31:57] He said, "Father, if there's any way at
[1:31:59] all, can we just change the plan?"
[1:32:02] He says, "But not what I will, but you
[1:32:05] will."
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; It it it it it uh when I thought about
[1:32:12] that, in fact, Jesus Christ had to had
[1:32:15] to choose to go to the cross.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; To me, that's huge.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; He knew what awaited him there. I mean
[1:32:24] he had already the angels had come down
[1:32:26] minister to him and all this other stuff
[1:32:28] but he still had to make he himself had
[1:32:30] to make the choice
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; to go on the cross to die for our sins
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; to me that's huge
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; the greatest love it could be expressed
[1:32:40] to humanity was Jesus on that cross
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:32:45] so he so that's right he believed what
[1:32:48] God said was true the words must be
[1:32:50] filled he knew that his life was to
[1:32:51] fulfill do we understand what we are to
[1:32:54] fulfill.
[1:32:56] We are coming to the place where it
[1:32:57] talks about the manifestation of the
[1:32:59] sons of God.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That has to be fulfilled.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Through us.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; We are his body.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Um brother Random another place says the
[1:33:10] bride has to come to adoption.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Means the same thing we're saying is the
[1:33:17] same as God himself saying it.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And okay. Um, if God is not the one in
[1:33:25] control, we would say an awful lot of
[1:33:27] things which we shouldn't be saying.
[1:33:29] Sure, you know, hey, be nice to have a
[1:33:31] nice red Ferrari out there, you know,
[1:33:34] you know, but okay, you know, that's I
[1:33:37] don't think that's God's will.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Another place I was at and it was hot
[1:33:41] and they say, "Oh, yeah. I'm praying for
[1:33:42] snow." And they and they looked at me
[1:33:44] and said, "No, no. I I'm just using it
[1:33:46] for an example. I don't expect snow this
[1:33:48] afternoon." It was 105 outside. I don't
[1:33:51] expect snow today. Okay. But but here
[1:33:53] again, but you you be have one of the
[1:33:56] things I have learned in my life.
[1:33:59] What I what comes out of my mouth to a
[1:34:02] large extent determines what I expect.
[1:34:04] Sure. And you get older, you have aches
[1:34:07] and pains and other issues. And if I
[1:34:11] concentrate on the issues, the aches and
[1:34:14] the pains, you know, I get up and oh
[1:34:16] man, oh yeah, I overworked yesterday. Oh
[1:34:18] man, this hurts. Oh, bad. It's terrible.
[1:34:21] Oh man, what should I do today? Oh my
[1:34:24] Oh, it's going to be a horrible horrible
[1:34:26] day. I just feel Oh, I just ache so
[1:34:28] butt. You've spoken now. Enjoy it.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Right.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; But you can go look, you can go and you
[1:34:34] can take it and begin with all the aches
[1:34:36] and pains. It says, "The sun has risen.
[1:34:40] God has given me another day to enjoy
[1:34:42] his presence."
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; It's in that I rejoice.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And I spoke it. Now I enjoy expect.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, it it's it's
[1:34:52] it's that simple. You know, some people
[1:34:54] say, "Oh, yeah, brother Brandham, you
[1:34:56] know, he spoke the storm out of
[1:34:57] existence. He spoke the squirrels into
[1:34:59] existence, all these other things." And,
[1:35:01] you know, oh, that was fine for him, but
[1:35:03] what about us?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; I know. I was visiting with my brother
[1:35:08] in Arkansas. We were in downtown,
[1:35:11] wherever this town was, and uh a tornado
[1:35:14] was coming, and I looked and it was head
[1:35:17] right down the street where we were at.
[1:35:18] I figured, uh oh, I looked around. Ain't
[1:35:21] nothing to hang on to. Says, Lord, just
[1:35:24] let it go around us. It's interesting.
[1:35:27] It went, it split. It went around us. We
[1:35:30] joined and kept going. Amen. Was that my
[1:35:33] spoken word?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know. All I know is God honored
[1:35:36] it.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; We were in Jamaica once and they had a
[1:35:40] there was a hurricane.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there was hurricanes they called.
[1:35:43] There was a hurricane heading right for
[1:35:45] where we were at in in Jamaica. And we
[1:35:49] all were praying. We said, "Lord, just
[1:35:51] take it. Instead of it going this way,
[1:35:53] have it make a sharper turn." And we had
[1:35:57] just said, "Amen." And all of a sudden,
[1:35:59] you watch the news and it took a sharp
[1:36:01] turn.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We got some rain, we got some
[1:36:04] wind, but if it had gone like it had, I
[1:36:06] mean, this last one hit Jamaica. I mean,
[1:36:07] it devastated.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Well, that could have been us.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That could have been us. Yeah.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; But here again, we we have within us the
[1:36:17] ability. We have the we have within us
[1:36:20] the rights to become and to manifest a
[1:36:22] God that is dwells in us.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; But he has to have the preeminence. It
[1:36:27] cannot be us. It has to be him guiding
[1:36:30] and directing our lives. It has to be
[1:36:32] him speaking through us. It has to be by
[1:36:35] his leadership and his guidance that we
[1:36:38] begin to manifest the God that is within
[1:36:40] us.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; It's not about us. It's about him. It
[1:36:44] It's not about what we do. It's what we
[1:36:46] allow to do through us.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And I know I' I've spoken this many
[1:36:50] times about Habacook and people probably
[1:36:52] get tired of that, but when I looked at
[1:36:54] the life of Habacook, he was a they God
[1:36:57] had said, "I'm going to bring
[1:36:58] destruction upon the city of Jerusalem."
[1:37:01] And Habacook, in my opinion, was fearful
[1:37:04] for his life.
[1:37:06] And so Habac began to pray and and u and
[1:37:11] uh well in Habac what two and three he
[1:37:15] says he says that for the vision is yet
[1:37:17] for an appointed time but yet at the end
[1:37:20] speak it will not lie though ter
[1:37:23] will will come. Behold his soul which is
[1:37:25] lifted up is not is not upright in him
[1:37:27] but the just shall live by his faith.
[1:37:29] And there it talks about a person if a
[1:37:32] person who relies upon himself. He says
[1:37:34] I live in a fortress. I can control my
[1:37:36] outcome. I can control my life. I can I
[1:37:38] don't need God. So God says, "Fine. I
[1:37:41] won't help you."
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wish you luck. But it came down to
[1:37:45] Habacook. And it talks about Habacook.
[1:37:49] It talks about Habacook. He It talks
[1:37:52] about having a faith between the
[1:37:53] creature and the creator where the
[1:37:56] creature is totally reliant upon his
[1:37:58] creator.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. where he has where where God has
[1:38:02] total preeminence in leading and guiding
[1:38:05] Habacook's life.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Where Habacook would no longer rely upon
[1:38:09] himself to see him through the battles
[1:38:11] which are coming. He would rely upon the
[1:38:13] God that had promised to him to take him
[1:38:15] through what was coming.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And when I read that, I I I I asked the
[1:38:19] Lord, I said, "Will you if I put my
[1:38:22] trust in you like you've asked Habacook,
[1:38:24] will you will you watch over me and take
[1:38:26] me through what's coming also?" because
[1:38:27] I we don't know about tomorrow.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I I have no idea what's going to happen
[1:38:31] tomorrow,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; But God spoke to me and he says, "Yeah,
[1:38:34] if you will trust me like Habacook, like
[1:38:37] I asked Habacook to trust me."
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Says, "I will see you through whatever
[1:38:41] is coming."
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And since that point on, I have been at
[1:38:45] rest.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Because I know it's not about me. It's
[1:38:48] not about me controlling the fear. I I
[1:38:50] have no control over the government. I
[1:38:52] have no control over the weather. I have
[1:38:54] no control over what's coming.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God does.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; God, if I will, if I will trust him, he
[1:39:02] will take care of me and whatever is
[1:39:04] coming.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; And to me, this is what God is trying to
[1:39:08] get us to get to. He's trying to get us
[1:39:11] to the place as Christians, we no longer
[1:39:14] rely upon us. We rely upon him.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Vanam another place said, "Yeah,
[1:39:20] he says sickness will come and this will
[1:39:22] come and this will come. Will we all
[1:39:23] have troubles and trials?" Sure, we
[1:39:25] will. It doesn't negate them. It doesn't
[1:39:27] make all from this point on it's smooth
[1:39:28] sailing down the road. No, no, no, no.
[1:39:31] You look at David's life. You look at
[1:39:32] Joseph's life. It wasn't smooth sailing
[1:39:34] for either one of those.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; But God watched over them. He kept them.
[1:39:38] He guided them through everything which
[1:39:40] was going. You look at other examples in
[1:39:43] the Bible and we find people we find
[1:39:45] other people.
[1:39:47] Why why was why did Barnabas have to be
[1:39:50] born have to be have to go blind so
[1:39:54] Jesus could heal him?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; There was another one at uh
[1:39:59] I think they they brought somebody I
[1:40:01] think it was brought him to Jesus. This
[1:40:03] boy Yeah. This boy was born blind
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; and the disciples says who sinned? This
[1:40:09] man. How could this guy
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; unborn? How could he sin? Come on. Give
[1:40:13] me a break. Was it him sin or or was his
[1:40:16] parents that sinned? Why he was born
[1:40:18] blind?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, for neither one." But
[1:40:20] see, the glory of God could be made
[1:40:22] manifest.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; This guy had to be born blind. He had to
[1:40:27] grow up blind so that Jesus Christ could
[1:40:30] come and give him his sight so God could
[1:40:34] be glorified.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; It's totally that that that most of us
[1:40:38] that doesn't compute, you know,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; but God has a plan and we don't know it.
[1:40:43] We do not understand what he is trying
[1:40:46] to accomplish.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; All we know is that we have to sub. We
[1:40:50] have to learn to submit to what his will
[1:40:53] is
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; and allow him to lead and guide our
[1:40:56] lives and then rest in whatever
[1:40:59] situation we find ourselves trusting God
[1:41:03] that God will fulfill his plan for our
[1:41:06] lives.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam had to come to that place
[1:41:09] in his life and I believe we have to
[1:41:11] come to that place in our life. We are
[1:41:13] at the end.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. That's my opinion. We we
[1:41:17] have arrived.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; The end is not future. No, we're in the
[1:41:20] middle of it.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; What'll happen between now and then, you
[1:41:27] know, when the when the rapture when we
[1:41:28] get the changing of our body? I don't
[1:41:30] know.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; I have my opinion and I've talked to
[1:41:33] other ministers and they have different
[1:41:35] opinions. So, I keep my opinion to
[1:41:37] myself and let them have their opinion
[1:41:38] and we just get along fine. Okay.
[1:41:41] nothing to argue about because we don't
[1:41:42] know. God fulfills his word by bringing
[1:41:45] it to pass,
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; So when they ask me, "Is this going to
[1:41:47] be or is this going to be?" I says,
[1:41:48] "Well, when it comes to pass, I'll let
[1:41:50] you know."
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Because that's the only way we will
[1:41:54] know. That's the only interpretation of
[1:41:56] of God's plan is when all when he
[1:41:58] actually brings it to pass.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I but like I I try to mention
[1:42:03] here that where brother Brown talks
[1:42:04] about that he says
[1:42:07] he he says a Christian's faith is based
[1:42:10] solidly upon rest.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. A Christian is not tossed
[1:42:14] about. A Christian doesn't run from
[1:42:16] place to place. A Christian doesn't fuss
[1:42:18] and fume and worry about things. A
[1:42:21] Christian rest.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It's all over. It was all finished for a
[1:42:26] believer in Calvary.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And let's just pray. That's right.
[1:42:30] Heavenly Father, we gather ourselves
[1:42:32] together this morning and just Lord
[1:42:35] thankful that you thankful Lord for the
[1:42:37] way that you've been here and the way
[1:42:39] that you guided my thoughts and the
[1:42:40] words which I've spoken and I trust Lord
[1:42:43] that what was spoken Lord was what you
[1:42:45] would have spoken
[1:42:47] because Lord you in my opin opinion and
[1:42:50] what you've impressed upon me we have to
[1:42:52] come to the place where we totally rely
[1:42:54] upon you and trust you and rest in you
[1:42:58] know knowing that that You are you are
[1:43:00] the one that controls the future. You
[1:43:03] control my future. Yes. Or the future of
[1:43:05] everyone that is here. And Lord, we have
[1:43:07] to be we have to be able to come in my
[1:43:10] opinion, we have to Lord, we I we have
[1:43:13] to come to the place, Lord, where we
[1:43:15] actually will so have faith in you that
[1:43:18] regardless of what happens, we know that
[1:43:20] you're in control, Lord. You're leading
[1:43:22] and guiding our lives. So take this
[1:43:25] thought Lord, present it into the hearts
[1:43:27] of the people and help us to come to the
[1:43:29] place Lord where we we go behind that
[1:43:32] last veil. We see it in your presence
[1:43:35] and are totally at rest realizing that
[1:43:37] you are the one who is going to control
[1:43:40] and take care of all things.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; You have a plan for each and every one
[1:43:44] of our lives. And Lord, we know that you
[1:43:45] will fulfill your plan for our lives. We
[1:43:48] need to rest in that. Grant this, Lord.
[1:43:50] I ask it in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:07] Appreciate brother enjoyed that message.
[1:44:12] Enjoy the truth of that message. Amen.
[1:44:15] The Lord speaking and knowing that that
[1:44:17] was his word and encouragement. Amen.
[1:44:20] Something to rest upon. realize that a
[1:44:23] lot of what uh brother Noah uh brought
[1:44:26] to us today is things that we know in
[1:44:29] our hearts and things that we realize
[1:44:31] and have read and heard preached. But
[1:44:33] you know, sometimes it just takes
[1:44:35] something like that to bring back your
[1:44:36] remembrance. We fret and we worry and we
[1:44:40] uh strive over things that just really
[1:44:42] don't have any significance, right?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Because we don't have control over them
[1:44:46] anyway. Lord has control over them. It's
[1:44:49] up to him. It's what he does.
[1:44:51] Amen. He talks about the present. You
[1:44:53] know, that's scriptural. Bible tells us
[1:44:55] he puts them up. He sets them down. It's
[1:44:58] up to him that does it. Amen. Whatever
[1:45:00] God does, that's that's what we rest in
[1:45:03] and believe in and trust. I look at it
[1:45:05] and sometimes it grates against my
[1:45:07] spirit because I don't want to see it go
[1:45:09] that way, but I want it to be according
[1:45:12] to his will. Amen. So, that's a that's a
[1:45:15] part of my coming under the subjection
[1:45:18] of the will of the Lord. Amen. Because
[1:45:20] it's not happening arbitrarily, saints.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; all this stuff is not just happening.
[1:45:25] This is not just going on. It's it's not
[1:45:28] because, like you even said, the vote of
[1:45:29] the people. It's because it's God doing
[1:45:32] it. God orchestrating it. God's will.
[1:45:34] And let it be happen whatever God's will
[1:45:36] is because that's what our desire should
[1:45:38] be anyway.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is. And I know that God will
[1:45:41] make as he does for all of us work
[1:45:44] everything out for our good
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; because we love him. Amen. We don't have
[1:45:49] just some passing affinity for him. We
[1:45:52] don't just have some love that we say a
[1:45:55] filio because he's done something good
[1:45:57] for us. No, we love him regardless.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "If he were to send me
[1:46:02] to hell, if I go the way I am now, I'll
[1:46:05] still love him."
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that love doesn't change.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Doesn't change because where you are.
[1:46:11] Doesn't change because who you are.
[1:46:13] Doesn't change because of circumstances.
[1:46:15] Nothing changes it. If it's the love of
[1:46:17] God, it's settled. It's finished. It's
[1:46:19] unconditional. So no matter where you
[1:46:21] are, what's going on in life, you still
[1:46:23] love him. That love does not change,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that's why brother
[1:46:27] Ram said, "He cast me into hell. I'd
[1:46:29] still if I went the way he said, if I go
[1:46:31] the way I go now, I would still love
[1:46:33] him." Why? Because it's not going to
[1:46:35] change,
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; It's God's. And that's what we trust in.
[1:46:39] That's what we rest in. That's what we
[1:46:40] believe in because he's working it all
[1:46:43] out for our good. May not go the way we
[1:46:45] like it to go. We may not go the way we
[1:46:47] want it to go. It's like I've said many
[1:46:49] times, saints, we pray all often. We
[1:46:52] pray that God would do something or God
[1:46:54] would heal somebody or God would move
[1:46:56] over here or God would let
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; and then God's moving to work something
[1:47:00] and but he's not doing it the way that
[1:47:01] we envisioned he was going to do it. And
[1:47:04] because it's not the way we thought it
[1:47:05] was going to be, we totally miss God.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; God's over here trying to work out your
[1:47:09] prayer and you're missing it because
[1:47:11] it's not done the way you think it
[1:47:12] should be done. Forget about your
[1:47:14] attitudes. Forget about your opinions,
[1:47:16] your thoughts, actions. Let God do it
[1:47:18] the way he wants to do it. Just believe
[1:47:19] and say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it. Praise the Lord. Can
[1:47:24] we put on there six All is Will.
[1:47:27] I'm going to put on the screen what I
[1:47:29] think we probably all know this anyway,
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; but uh from the very beginning of
[1:47:33] Brother No's message, this song came to
[1:47:35] my heart and I wanted to sing it. Amen.
[1:47:37] But there's some verses in there that's
[1:47:39] not in the book. It's 650 in the book,
[1:47:41] but the verses aren't in here. And I
[1:47:42] love singing the verses. Amen. I love
[1:47:45] the chorus to this song, too. And it
[1:47:46] speaks so much to what Brother Null was
[1:47:48] telling us, ministering to us just now.
[1:47:51] And u I uh I just want us to sing it.
[1:47:54] Can we sing this? Praise the Lord. We'll
[1:47:57] sing the verses, too, but we'll have it
[1:47:58] up on the screen for you. Let's sing
[1:48:00] this. All is well.
[1:48:07] All is well.
[1:48:12] We have heard the message shalom and all
[1:48:18] is well.
[1:48:23] Well, there is a place of perfect rest
[1:48:29] behind the inner veil.
[1:48:34] So rest little bride rest for all is
[1:48:40] well.
[1:48:45] Well, there's a story in the Bible of
[1:48:48] Elijah,
[1:48:50] the Junomite woman and her son.
[1:48:55] The woman found favor with God,
[1:49:00] so he gave her a son.
[1:49:05] But while working in the field, the
[1:49:09] little boy had died. But the woman's
[1:49:13] faith never failed. Even in death, she
[1:49:18] testified
[1:49:21] that all is well.
[1:49:26] Yes, all is well.
[1:49:29] You believe that today? Yes, all is
[1:49:33] well.
[1:49:37] We have heard the message shalom and all
[1:49:43] is well.
[1:49:47] Well, there is a place of perfect rest
[1:49:54] behind the inner veil.
[1:49:58] So rest, let the bride rest, for all is
[1:50:05] well.
[1:50:09] Now things have not worked out
[1:50:14] like God's people fall
[1:50:20] cuz we're still here and we're fighting
[1:50:25] the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:30] But if we'll have the faith of Abraham,
[1:50:36] knowing God's word never fails,
[1:50:40] if we'll trust in him, we'll find that
[1:50:46] all is well.
[1:50:50] Yes, all is well.
[1:50:56] All is well.
[1:51:01] We have heard the message shalom and all
[1:51:07] is well.
[1:51:12] Well, there is a place of perfect rest
[1:51:18] behind the anger veil.
[1:51:23] So rest, let her bride rest, for all is
[1:51:29] well. Can we sing it one more time now?
[1:51:33] Yes. All is well.
[1:51:38] All is well.
[1:51:43] We have heard the message shalom and all
[1:51:49] is aware.
[1:51:54] Oh, there is a place of perfect rest
[1:52:00] behind the inner veil. So rest little a
[1:52:07] bright rest for all is well.
[1:52:14] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:52:18] That's just a personification of a of a
[1:52:21] Christian, of a bride's Christian's
[1:52:24] walk, of their life, of their living.
[1:52:28] Amen. It's just entering into that
[1:52:30] presence and living at rest.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A lot of people talk
[1:52:34] about entering into his presence in a
[1:52:37] sanctuary or in a church service, but
[1:52:39] friend, we should press into that
[1:52:41] spirit, into that rest every moment of
[1:52:44] every day of our lives. It should be a
[1:52:46] constant, persistent, perpetual living.
[1:52:51] Amen. Of being in God's presence.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Being at rest.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Being at peace. Shalom.
[1:52:58] Amen. Peace. That's the way that the
[1:53:01] bride should be living today. At peace.
[1:53:04] Amen. At rest. Amen. Let me ensure you
[1:53:07] again and encourage you as brother N
[1:53:09] just did. God has it all under control.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; And he promised that he will work it out
[1:53:16] for our good.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; So, what else is there to worry about,
[1:53:20] to fred over, to be concerned about?
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; He's got it all under control. Amen. And
[1:53:27] I'm so thankful that he does. Praise
[1:53:29] God. Amen. I'm encouraged to hear and
[1:53:33] and and I'm thankful that Brother Null
[1:53:35] and Sister Shirley are going to get to
[1:53:37] go back to India this year. I know he
[1:53:39] had expressed to me a year or so ago or
[1:53:41] whenever it was uh wanted to go back.
[1:53:44] Didn't look like they were going to uh
[1:53:46] didn't know he was praying and had a
[1:53:48] desire of the Lord just one more time.
[1:53:50] But Amen. I'm very thankful, very happy.
[1:53:53] Uh as much as you can do with modern
[1:53:56] technology and cameras and videos and
[1:53:59] being uh one place and watching in
[1:54:02] another things like that, there's no
[1:54:04] substitute. There's absolutely no
[1:54:07] substitute for being in person. There
[1:54:09] just isn't. I mean, that's why that's
[1:54:11] why the Bible tells us to forsake not
[1:54:14] the assembling of ourselves together.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. One day, we're
[1:54:20] going to all gather together under that
[1:54:22] same banner. Amen. Go home to be with
[1:54:25] the Lord.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Looking for our loved ones at any time.
[1:54:29] You know, Brother Null,
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; when it's something like that that you
[1:54:31] talk about, uh, and I have my feelings,
[1:54:34] my opinions, my thoughts about, if I
[1:54:36] express that to my congregation, I
[1:54:38] always make sure and let them know. Um,
[1:54:39] this is what I think.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; This is how I feel. Amen. This is my
[1:54:44] opinion and how I believe it's going to
[1:54:46] be. I always preface it to make sure
[1:54:48] they know. I do the same.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; But, but I also say, but I derive my
[1:54:55] feeling from scripture. I don't just
[1:54:57] come up with something out of the blue.
[1:54:59] I I derive my opinion and my feeling
[1:55:02] based on what I believe the scripture
[1:55:04] and the message is saying. So, amen.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Uh, there's there's context to it, too.
[1:55:08] Not just this is just my opinion. But as
[1:55:11] he said, there's so many of these things
[1:55:14] uh that we don't know. Amen. It's going
[1:55:16] to happen when it happens, when it comes
[1:55:18] to pass.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Uh I'll let you know if I'm the first to
[1:55:21] know. If you're the first know, you can
[1:55:22] let me know.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, it's going to happen. I
[1:55:26] a lot of people talk about is California
[1:55:28] going to sink before the bride goes to
[1:55:30] rapture after, you know. Oh, brother
[1:55:32] Bradam never says.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; We don't know. Amen. Nobody knows. I
[1:55:36] have my opinion, but I don't know.
[1:55:39] Praise the Lord. But we know it's going
[1:55:41] to happen. That's the main thing. Amen.
[1:55:42] We know it is going to happen. Praise
[1:55:44] the Lord. So, let's stand to our feet if
[1:55:46] we could. Amen.
[1:55:49] I'll stop preaching now and um we'll let
[1:55:52] you be dismissed, but I'm so very
[1:55:54] thankful to have brother with us. How

[1:59:46] today and spirit that we feel and know,
[1:59:48] God, just the freedom that that is in
[1:59:50] that anointing. Lord, it just feels so
[1:59:52] good. And Lord, to be at peace and to be
[1:59:54] at rest with all that's we're going
[1:59:57] through and living in. And in this world
[1:59:59] sometimes it's it seems like peace is so
[2:00:02] far away. It seems like a a restful
[2:00:05] condition is so far away. A restful mind
[2:00:08] of a a body at peace. Lord, it just
[2:00:10] seems sometimes in this world like it's
[2:00:12] so far away and so unattainable. But
[2:00:14] Lord, we have been taught again today.
[2:00:16] We have been reminded that that rest is
[2:00:19] always there. It's a perpetual rest that
[2:00:22] exists if we just enter into it. Lord,

[2:00:38] there's grace, there's uh blessing and
[2:00:41] salvation and healing and rest. There's

[2:00:47] you bless each one of us today to Lord,
[2:00:49] just take this sermon into our hearts,
[2:00:52] Lord. May we just take it into our
[2:00:54] spirits, our souls, and let us be
[2:00:56] anchored in that today, God, in that
[2:00:58] rest. And thanking you, Lord, for
[2:01:01] bringing them our way and ministering it
[2:01:02] to us, reminding us, Lord, every day,
[2:01:05] Father, of who we are and who we are in
[2:01:08] you. And God, just bringing us to that
