[26:33] that you told us one time
[26:36] you went into the temple to pray yes one
[26:39] was a
[26:40] a pharisee and one was a publican and
[26:43] the pharisee just bragged how much he
[26:46] has done for you paying his tithes and
[26:49] going to church and helping this one and
[26:52] just doing all the good that he could
[26:56] and the elder the publican just so
[26:59] humble
[27:00] and he felt he couldn't even lift up his
[27:03] eyes to heaven for he said forgive such
[27:07] a sinner's eye
[27:09] and father one
[27:11] was justified of himself and he got his
[27:14] own reward here on earth and the other
[27:17] one was justified of you knowing that
[27:20] his reward his treasures lay in heaven

[33:22] just no accountability today
[33:25] nothing's anybody's fault anymore
[33:27] either sick or delusional or mental or
[33:31] whatever it is it's never the person's
[33:34] fault anymore there's always a reason
[33:36] excuses and it's just sad that's just a
[33:39] very sad testimony but we know a god who
[33:41] can help
[33:43] on this lady in this girl's heart
[33:46] just touch and move in that special way

[34:11] sent me a text praise god for answered
[34:14] prayers about me having double vision
[34:16] problems
[34:17] remember she said you me spoke the word
[34:21] uh last week
[34:23] when
[34:24] we'll say mistakenly had it as a praise
[34:26] report and said a prayer request i don't
[34:28] believe it was a mistake but
[34:30] thank the lord
[34:32] uh as you spoke the word for mri tests
[34:35] to be okay and the vision to be
[34:37] corrected god honored that
[34:39] all the tests mri came back negative and
[34:42] the double vision is getting better
[34:45] maybe corrected with glasses praise god
[34:47] for his loving care
[34:49] amen amen
[34:51] praise the lord
[34:53] amen
[34:55] so one that was considered a
[34:57] prayer request last week we read as a

[40:14] she lost her home and her mom moved out
[40:17] she had come into my yard
[40:20] and they were her and her boyfriend were
[40:23] doing drugs and
[40:25] they almost died i had to call the emts
[40:28] and
[40:29] she
[40:30] hated me after that and she couldn't
[40:33] remember she lost her clothes i gave
[40:34] them both their clothes and everything
[40:36] and they went on down the road
[40:38] and she kept coming back to me while her
[40:40] boyfriend came back
[40:42] and i found some more stuff i gave it to
[40:44] him she was she was looking at me
[40:47] you know cockeyed like i'd done
[40:49] something to her well i would have been
[40:52] praying that god would make a way to
[40:54] bring her back because she hadn't heard
[40:56] the gospel because she'd been so zoned
[40:58] out
[40:59] all the time when i met her or she was
[41:01] in such a hurry
[41:03] and to get out and go do whatever she
[41:06] did and
[41:08] last night i was standing in the lane
[41:12] and she came up to me and i don't see so
[41:15] well and so i didn't know who it was
[41:17] right away and she's put on a little bit
[41:18] of weight which i'm glad
[41:20] and she saw me and she came up and she
[41:24] put an arm around me
[41:27] i was so i've got answered prayer and
[41:30] healed that breach
[41:32] she thought that i had done it wrong
[41:35] and called in the emts and everything
[41:37] couldn't understand why i'd asked her to
[41:39] leave and so
[41:40] now she i guess she understands now amen
[41:44] and
[41:45] and as she hugged me and so now now god
[41:49] can work praise the lord amen amen
[41:52] amen god is good
[41:54] we're supposed to baptize somebody
[41:55] yesterday but
[41:56] uh he wasn't able to make it so we'll
[41:58] see if that happens guy's name is billy
[42:00] so remember him in prayer yeah he's
[42:03] already been baptized
[42:05] we prayed for my neighbor had cancer and
[42:08] they gave him one year to live that was
[42:10] they

[42:27] one who matters the most does
[42:34] amen praise the lord god is good
[42:37] thankful to him amen let's turn our
[42:39] bibles down genesis chapter 1
[42:42] and then we're going to continue where
[42:43] we left off last week lord willing here
[42:48] genesis chapter one read the first
[42:50] couple of verses of scripture
[42:52] here again as we uh get back into the
[42:55] new beginning part two
[42:57] and then new beginning part two like i
[42:59] said
[43:00] probably going to be several parts to it
[43:02] um just however the lord leads it but uh
[43:06] there's a lot that goes through the
[43:08] scripture when you begin to look at it
[43:10] and see
[43:11] the little nuances of the scriptures and
[43:13] how god
[43:14] uh flows from genesis 1 to revelation
[43:17] 22.
[43:18] he never changes god and his patterns
[43:21] and how he works and what he does and
[43:23] how he reveals himself just just
[43:26] when you really start looking at the
[43:27] scripture it's just
[43:29] it's just infallible
[43:30] it's just infallible god is uh god is
[43:33] not the unchanging almighty god
[43:36] amen but again we're going to start with
[43:39] the first chapter of genesis the first
[43:41] verse but before we do let's buy our
[43:43] heads for another word of prayer
[43:45] precious jesus father again is a

[45:40] hearts now lord and reveal it as you

[45:44] to you in the name of the lord jesus
[45:45] christ we pray amen amen amen
[45:48] amen genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[45:52] in the beginning god created the heaven
[45:54] and the earth
[45:55] period
[45:57] that's a mouthful just that
[45:59] the earth was without form and void and
[46:01] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[46:03] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[46:05] face of the waters
[46:06] you could be seated if you'd like
[46:10] amen i'm going to go over to hebrews
[46:11] chapter 11.
[46:14] amen hebrews chapter 11. but as we
[46:16] remember back in genesis because we will
[46:18] be referring back to genesis several
[46:21] times a couple more times today uh
[46:24] obviously probably in future
[46:26] messages to come uh genesis because we
[46:30] know genesis is the seed chapter genesis
[46:32] is the beginning genesis is
[46:34] uh the
[46:35] everything that began everything that
[46:37] exists today began there amen let me
[46:40] read this to you i will restore 1954
[46:43] brother graham says now that in order to
[46:45] get the basis for this for a few minutes
[46:48] i believe that everything that is now
[46:50] began in genesis right amen everything
[46:53] that is now began in genesis
[46:56] the word genesis is the beginning and
[46:59] every cult that we have on the face of
[47:00] the earth today began in genesis
[47:03] everything that we have today started in
[47:05] genesis it's beginning otherwise known
[47:07] as the seed chapter of the bible where
[47:09] the beginning originated when god way
[47:11] back before there was ever a star in
[47:13] heaven before there was even light in
[47:15] the skies that's as far as our mind
[47:17] could look back and take it god was
[47:19] there
[47:20] all that great space of eternity to
[47:22] eternity god was setting back in
[47:24] eternity then he moved out god became
[47:27] the logos which could say it uh which
[47:30] would say it uh like a little sacred
[47:32] light that moved out of that darkness or
[47:35] out of that eternity as a child playing
[47:37] before the father's house his infinite
[47:38] mind
[47:39] he had this scene that he would be at
[47:41] the end of the beginning uh at the end
[47:44] from the beginning that uh that he was
[47:46] then
[47:47] then he spoke and said let there be and
[47:50] then adam split yard of the sky
[47:51] somewhere in the sun came into existence
[47:54] after 100 billion years a clinker flew
[47:56] off of it was a star
[47:57] and watch it falling it fell maybe
[48:00] several million years and then god
[48:02] stopped it and there it fell and it
[48:04] stopped it and god another one fell and
[48:06] he stopped it he said what was god doing
[48:08] he was writing his first bible
[48:11] god's creation and the clinker falling
[48:13] off and god lets it fly through till he
[48:15] says that's far enough stop right there
[48:17] you stop right there and you put all the
[48:19] constellation everything look at it's in
[48:20] perfect word today than the day it was
[48:23] created god placed exactly where it's
[48:25] supposed to be amen writing his first
[48:28] bible we had three bibles written one of
[48:30] them in the heavens above the zodiac it
[48:33] starts with the virgin ends up with the
[48:34] of the lion first coming second coming
[48:36] the lord jesus down to different ages
[48:38] then we find enoch right in the pyramids
[48:42] and then the third was put on paper
[48:44] which we have here sitting before us now
[48:46] we know again uh that beginning that
[48:49] genesis was the beginning of all things
[48:52] but let's go over to hebrews now and
[48:54] chapter 11
[48:58] hebrews chapter 11. we're just going to
[48:59] read one verse of scripture here because
[49:01] we're going to get back into this new
[49:03] beginning we know that we talked about
[49:04] last week the andalusian world and the
[49:08] destruction of the andalusian world by
[49:10] water and then we had the as we called
[49:12] it the bc
[49:14] uh error age 2000 roughly
[49:18] not exactly but roughly 2 000 years
[49:21] until jesus came died and shed his blood
[49:23] and dropped his blood upon this earth
[49:25] which received its sanctification
[49:27] process
[49:28] and then at the end we know this world
[49:31] that we live in now a.d
[49:34] is the world that's going to be
[49:35] destroyed by fire that is going to be
[49:37] completely purified by fire we know that
[49:40] water couldn't purify it the blood
[49:42] purified the spirit but not the actual
[49:45] uh uh uh
[49:48] physicality of the world but now the
[49:50] fire completely annihilates all sin all
[49:53] sin not even a molecule or a germ of sin
[49:56] will be left once that is done
[49:59] and it will read some scripture later
[50:00] about that but let's go back again in in
[50:03] the andaluvian world we got to an end of
[50:06] the andalumian world with with uh with
[50:08] noah
[50:09] and the va and the bible talks about
[50:11] knowing in the faith chapter of hebrews
[50:13] like this by faith
[50:15] by faith noah being warned of god of
[50:19] things not seen as yet now we know that
[50:22] there had never reigned on the earth up
[50:24] unto this time
[50:26] god watered the earth from from
[50:28] underneath the water come up from
[50:30] underneath the earth to water all the
[50:32] plants the body life and all that the
[50:34] animals needed and what humans needed
[50:36] came from underneath the earth they had
[50:38] never reigned up to that time so when
[50:40] god warned noah he won't know of
[50:42] something that had never happened before
[50:45] god told noah i'm going to do this
[50:47] something that has never happened so to
[50:50] have the faith to believe that god could
[50:52] do something is one thing
[50:54] but to have the faith to know that god
[50:56] can do something that has never happened
[50:59] in the history of humanity up to that
[51:01] time before
[51:02] to me is probably even another level of
[51:04] faith
[51:05] another level of faith to believe that
[51:07] god could create something that didn't
[51:10] exist
[51:11] god could cause something to happen that
[51:13] had never happened before so when noah
[51:15] moved by faith he moved by faith
[51:17] understanding not that god could create
[51:20] a blade of grass or that god can heal or
[51:22] that god could do the miracles that we
[51:24] know god can do today because he's
[51:26] already done those things but this is
[51:28] something god had never done
[51:30] god
[51:31] something that had never happened before
[51:33] so when god told noah this this was
[51:35] something of us of a real
[51:38] i would say high level of faith so when
[51:40] it says by faith noah
[51:43] yes he was warned of god but he was
[51:44] warned of god of something that he had
[51:46] never even seen before
[51:48] never knew had never happened
[51:51] not yet not seen as yet the bible says
[51:54] here not seen as yet so something that
[51:56] had never happened
[51:57] he moved with fear with reverence with
[52:01] respect he moved with fear prepared an
[52:04] ark to the saving of his house
[52:06] by the which he condemned the world and
[52:08] became heirs of the righteousness which
[52:11] is by faith now i want you to notice a
[52:14] little something that it tells us in the
[52:16] new testament that doesn't say this in
[52:18] the old testament but in the new
[52:20] testament and in light of the message
[52:22] that we have today
[52:23] we know what god has done
[52:28] of the time periods of each of these
[52:30] remember these special event happens
[52:34] major occurrence every two thousand ish
[52:37] years now we see that but as god has
[52:40] brought each one of these up
[52:43] the similarities and how god has allowed
[52:45] them to go through and what god has done
[52:48] to bring preparation for that time is
[52:51] just
[52:52] uh it is just god
[52:54] it's just miraculous it's a miracle when
[52:57] you go back and you study and you look
[52:59] and see
[53:00] what god has done
[53:02] through that period and to bring
[53:04] those that he's redeemed at that time
[53:08] to that point and through that point
[53:10] and shadowing in the old testament what
[53:13] he's doing in the new testament even to
[53:15] what he's doing today right today right
[53:18] now you can look at noah in in genesis 5
[53:23] 6 7 8 you can look at him in hebrews 11
[53:27] 7 here and you can see how god has
[53:30] has proven once again that not only
[53:33] there what we would say four thousand is
[53:36] years ago but god is doing the same
[53:38] thing today very much now let's read
[53:41] this again
[53:43] he said
[53:44] he moved with fear preparing an ark
[53:47] to the saving of his house
[53:50] noah prepared
[53:52] an ark now god gave noah the specific
[53:55] instructions that it was going to take
[53:58] for this ark to be able to sustain the
[54:01] judgment that was coming now we know of
[54:03] course enoch typed the bride noah typed
[54:06] the church enoch the bride went before
[54:08] the tribulation and noah went up through
[54:11] the tribulation period but god took care
[54:14] of noah god took care of noah and his
[54:18] family god helped and gave noah the
[54:20] preparation and the ability to be able
[54:23] to go beyond
[54:24] the judgment amen even though he was
[54:27] that tight beyond the judgment he
[54:29] prepared the ark for what purpose he
[54:32] prepared the ark to save his family
[54:36] that was the number one purpose
[54:38] it was to save his family right amen you
[54:41] want your family saved
[54:43] build that ark
[54:45] praise the lord build that ark
[54:47] that's the same thing no idea it's the
[54:49] same thing today build that ark noah
[54:51] built the ark number one to save his
[54:53] family but look what happened
[54:56] in the saving of his own life and his
[54:58] family's life
[55:00] what does the rest of it say he
[55:02] condemned the world
[55:06] at the same time he built the ark to
[55:08] save his family
[55:10] that ark became a condemnation to the
[55:13] rest of humanity
[55:16] same thing dual purpose
[55:18] just like god did when he when he came
[55:21] in flesh
[55:22] when jesus came in flesh and he died
[55:24] what happened
[55:26] he went to hell
[55:27] he went to hell and as we know
[55:29] by the scripture and of course by the
[55:31] message souls that are in prison he
[55:33] preached jesus preached to the souls
[55:36] that were in prison right amen then he
[55:39] sent a prophet in this last day
[55:42] to preach that exact same message souls
[55:44] that are in prison now
[55:47] indicating to us the time is now just
[55:51] like it was 4 000 years ago just like it
[55:53] was 2 000 years ago so it is today
[55:57] the preparing of the ark saves the
[56:00] redeemed but it also condemns now that's
[56:03] your part amen that's your ark the ark
[56:07] that you've prepared the ark the house
[56:09] that god lives in the ark that you've
[56:11] prepared is now not only saving you
[56:15] and going to put you in a rapture but
[56:17] it's also a condemnation to the rest of
[56:20] the world what did brother brown say and
[56:21] the souls are in person now he said that
[56:23] you are here ministering to the rest of
[56:26] these worlds your mere existence is a
[56:29] condemnation to the rest of the world
[56:32] that does not cannot will not believe
[56:35] right amen your existence just like
[56:38] jesus was
[56:40] amen it happened in noah's day he built
[56:43] the ark saved his family condemned the
[56:45] world
[56:46] jesus came saved the redeemed went to
[56:49] hell preached the souls in prison
[56:51] resurrected sitting on the right hand of
[56:53] god
[56:54] now the same thing happens today
[56:56] god's people
[56:58] god's bride in preparing an ark are
[57:01] becoming a condemnation to the rest of
[57:03] the world
[57:04] souls that are in prison today
[57:07] what did malachi tell us
[57:09] malachi chapter 4 3 and 4 tells us that
[57:13] he would send us elijah the prophet
[57:16] before the great and dreadful day of the
[57:19] lord now that elijah prophet has come
[57:22] the spirit of elijah in the prophet we
[57:24] know william branham that spirit that
[57:27] spoke that word come
[57:30] before the great amen it's great for who
[57:34] the redeemed
[57:35] the bride it's a great day for us yes
[57:38] it's a great day to the believer it's a
[57:41] great day to the bride amen but it's a
[57:44] dreadful day to those who are in this
[57:45] world that are facing all the things
[57:47] that's happening around in this world
[57:49] today and are going to continue to get
[57:51] worse
[57:52] in this world i hate to be a a a
[57:55] well it's not a downer if you're a
[57:57] believer i was going to say i hate to be
[57:58] a downer but it's not a downer if you're
[58:00] a believer
[58:01] amen
[58:02] uh
[58:03] it's not at all a downer it is it is a
[58:05] great day
[58:07] it's the great and dreadful day it's the
[58:09] ark to the saving of the souls but it's
[58:11] a condemnation to those who don't do not
[58:13] believe right so you see these the same
[58:16] thing
[58:17] provides the same purpose
[58:20] uh
[58:21] it's like that story that billy paul
[58:23] tells about uh i think it was billy paul
[58:25] told this story about the um
[58:28] yeah in fact i'm sure it is about this
[58:30] man who uh
[58:32] was a believer and he uh talked to
[58:36] somebody at work i believe it was his
[58:38] job and uh this guy became interested
[58:41] and he took took a message book and he
[58:43] said here uh i want you to read this
[58:45] read this when you get a chance
[58:47] the man comes back with that book and
[58:49] throws it in the man's chest and says
[58:51] don't you ever give me anything written
[58:52] by that man again i don't ever want to
[58:54] hear anything he has to say again
[58:56] and that man says what's the problem he
[58:58] said that man in that book called me a
[59:00] buzzard
[59:02] and he took the book and he said well
[59:04] that's funny the same man in the same
[59:06] book called be an eagle
[59:07] amen
[59:11] is it the ark
[59:12] that's the saving of the soul or is it a
[59:14] condemnation right
[59:16] serves the same purpose the same bible
[59:19] that we know as our type host and as our
[59:21] salvation is what uh uh has come to live
[59:25] in us the third written bible that god
[59:28] has written has come and that's that
[59:29] spirit of god him christ living in us
[59:32] now has become salvation
[59:34] but to the rest of the world is
[59:36] condemnation
[59:37] to those who don't believe to those who
[59:40] will not follow it to those who don't
[59:42] want to have anything to do with it
[59:43] becomes a condemnation your mere
[59:45] existence on this planet friends is a
[59:48] condemnation to the rest of the world
[59:50] who say i can't live that i can't
[59:52] believe that it's not possible your
[59:55] existence proves they are wrong
[59:58] your existence proves it can be believed
[1:00:00] your existence proves that it can be
[1:00:03] lived your existence proved that it can
[1:00:05] be believed
[1:00:07] amen can be lived because you are here
[1:00:10] living
[1:00:11] you are here doing it your existence it
[1:00:14] becomes it becomes a ministering to the
[1:00:17] world to the souls that are in prison
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] same thing notice again after the first
[1:00:24] two thousand years the ark did that
[1:00:27] second two thousand years jesus in his
[1:00:29] existence
[1:00:30] and preaching to the souls in prison did
[1:00:32] that now does the exact same thing today
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:36] at the end of this two thousand years
[1:00:38] see there's always a reason why god does
[1:00:41] certain things
[1:00:42] a certain way at certain times it's not
[1:00:45] necessarily what god does although
[1:00:47] that's a big part of it it also matters
[1:00:50] when he does it the timing of what god
[1:00:52] does is just as important as what he
[1:00:55] does and the timing of god sending a
[1:00:57] prophet elijah the prophet to bring a
[1:01:01] message to us to speak the words that he
[1:01:03] spoke those weren't just messages that
[1:01:06] we can go back and listen to or read in
[1:01:08] a book
[1:01:09] those were things that god had placed
[1:01:10] and it was in his mind before the
[1:01:12] foundation of the world that a man would
[1:01:14] come and preach to you his bride for
[1:01:16] this last day amen
[1:01:18] there's a reason for it
[1:01:20] god put it that way so that we could see
[1:01:22] it and know it and that it would fit the
[1:01:25] scripture
[1:01:26] the scripture does not change
[1:01:28] it does not deviate god does not change
[1:01:32] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:33] forever and if he done it one way one
[1:01:35] time he's got to do it all the way
[1:01:36] through and he does
[1:01:38] praise god and he's doing it today
[1:01:41] he's doing it today that great and
[1:01:44] dreadful day of the lord that's that is
[1:01:46] this day it's great to the believer but
[1:01:48] it's a dreadful time for those who won't
[1:01:50] believe it's a dreadful time to the
[1:01:53] world to the world cosmos
[1:01:56] amen amen that's why we do the best we
[1:02:00] can to help with all that we can as god
[1:02:02] gives our lips utterance we speak
[1:02:05] we don't cast our pearl before swine but
[1:02:08] as god gives us utterance we speak
[1:02:11] and as god speaks through us there's
[1:02:13] purpose yes amen there's purpose there's
[1:02:16] reason amen it's not just having
[1:02:18] something to say it's not just having
[1:02:21] somebody to say it to
[1:02:23] god could have preached souls in prison
[1:02:25] back with iranians if you wanted to but
[1:02:28] he didn't
[1:02:29] not to the degree that we know today why
[1:02:32] because it wasn't for that time yeah
[1:02:34] it's not just to have something to say
[1:02:36] it's not just to have somebody to say it
[1:02:37] to
[1:02:38] purposeful
[1:02:39] he meant the word the time the person
[1:02:42] purposeful and god and then when god's a
[1:02:45] part of it then it works out perfect
[1:02:47] amen now let's go over to second peter
[1:02:49] chapter three we'll continue on this
[1:02:53] andalusian world
[1:02:57] and the transition
[1:02:59] the transition from that
[1:03:01] into
[1:03:02] the post andalumian or the post flood
[1:03:07] uh i've got
[1:03:09] two messages
[1:03:11] that really
[1:03:13] run close together here so i'm trying to
[1:03:15] split them the best i can i may leak
[1:03:18] over into next week's
[1:03:20] i try not to i try to keep them as
[1:03:22] separate as possible but they run so
[1:03:24] close together uh and it would have
[1:03:26] taken
[1:03:27] two and a half hours to have brought it
[1:03:29] all today so
[1:03:30] um
[1:03:31] i tried to divide them to where we can
[1:03:33] just hit some highlights here and then
[1:03:36] uh get back to it lord really next next
[1:03:39] sunday but second peter chapter three
[1:03:41] now
[1:03:43] uh we'll begin reading with verse 3.
[1:03:45] ii peter chapter 3 verse 3.
[1:03:49] now knowing this first
[1:03:53] first
[1:03:54] that there shall come in the last days
[1:03:57] we know that's where we're living last
[1:03:59] days scoffers
[1:04:01] walking after their own lusts
[1:04:04] now generally they become scoffers
[1:04:06] because they're walking after their own
[1:04:08] lusts
[1:04:09] people who want to go their own way and
[1:04:12] do their own thing generally criticize
[1:04:14] anything that would come against that
[1:04:16] lust
[1:04:17] or that desire or that that want they'll
[1:04:20] criticize anybody anything that might
[1:04:23] interrupt or or cause them to feel
[1:04:26] condemned because of the light they're
[1:04:27] living so they become scoffers they've
[1:04:30] become stoppers uh to make fun of and
[1:04:33] and uh and put down
[1:04:36] walking after their own lust saying
[1:04:38] where is the promise of his coming
[1:04:41] for since the father's fellas not again
[1:04:45] let's look at the let's listen to the
[1:04:47] next couple of verses
[1:04:49] in the context of
[1:04:51] uh of of people trying to reason with
[1:04:55] the word
[1:04:57] this is speaking people that would try
[1:04:59] to
[1:05:00] understand
[1:05:01] or reason with the word
[1:05:05] where is the promise of his coming
[1:05:07] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:05:10] things continue as they were from the
[1:05:12] beginning of creation
[1:05:14] for this they willingly they willingly
[1:05:17] are ignorant of that by the word of god
[1:05:20] the heavens were of old and the earth
[1:05:22] standing out of the water and in the
[1:05:24] water
[1:05:25] whereby the world then that then was
[1:05:28] being overflowed with water perished the
[1:05:30] world perished now
[1:05:33] we'll get to that just a minute
[1:05:35] overflow with water perish but the
[1:05:38] heavens and the earth which are now by
[1:05:40] the same word are kept in store
[1:05:44] reserved unto fire
[1:05:46] against the day of judgment and
[1:05:48] perdition of ungodly men again the three
[1:05:51] stages water baptism blood baptism and
[1:05:54] fire baptism just like the holy spirit
[1:05:56] just like justification sanctification
[1:05:58] holy spirit god works in threes always
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:04] this world is reserved fire against the
[1:06:07] day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
[1:06:10] men but beloved now listen to this now
[1:06:13] now
[1:06:14] now peter is starting to explain
[1:06:16] spiritually first
[1:06:19] humanly trying to reason the word trying
[1:06:22] to understand the word uh
[1:06:25] is is one thing that people try to do
[1:06:27] well
[1:06:28] where is it he said he was coming where
[1:06:30] is he what's going on nothing's
[1:06:31] different nothing's changed but they
[1:06:34] fail to see
[1:06:35] into the eternities into the mind of god
[1:06:38] to realize what's going on
[1:06:41] why is god doing what he's doing and
[1:06:44] people try to figure god out all the
[1:06:46] time and people put god down and how
[1:06:48] could god allow this to happen i mean
[1:06:50] even the testimony micah gave us which i
[1:06:52] won't take but uh
[1:06:55] how could god allow something like that
[1:06:57] how how could he allow this to happen
[1:07:00] and starving children and blah blah blah
[1:07:03] people say that all the time you know
[1:07:05] again
[1:07:06] no human accountability right
[1:07:10] it doesn't happen that uh you know
[1:07:13] humanity inherently is serpent-seed and
[1:07:15] greedy by nature
[1:07:17] uh the love of money
[1:07:19] we get rich and we throw a little bit of
[1:07:21] money over at these people and think it
[1:07:23] just takes care of it
[1:07:24] and that it doesn't work that way
[1:07:27] but that's man's understanding of the
[1:07:29] scripture well where is he
[1:07:32] why is it like this this nothing's
[1:07:33] happened he's not come by yet he's not
[1:07:36] going to come it's not going to change
[1:07:38] nothing's going to be any different but
[1:07:40] now peter then begins to lay out to help
[1:07:43] understand god has a reason for
[1:07:45] everything he does and why he does it
[1:07:47] how he does it when he does it
[1:07:50] but beloved listen now be not ignorant
[1:07:52] of this one thing
[1:07:54] that one day is with the lord as a
[1:07:56] thousand years and a thousand years is
[1:07:58] one day in other words we've only been a
[1:08:00] few days
[1:08:02] it hasn't even been a whole week in
[1:08:03] god's mind
[1:08:05] right thousand one thousand years one
[1:08:07] day one day a thousand years hasn't even
[1:08:09] been a whole week yet six thousand years
[1:08:11] or so we've had on this planet
[1:08:13] hadn't even been a whole week
[1:08:15] as you would count a seven day week
[1:08:17] hasn't even been a whole weekend people
[1:08:19] say well it's been so long and nothing's
[1:08:22] happened it ain't even been a week
[1:08:25] the lord is not slack concerning his
[1:08:28] promise
[1:08:29] as some men count slightness but god is
[1:08:32] long-suffering
[1:08:35] praise the lord amen
[1:08:37] for his long suffering
[1:08:40] to us word
[1:08:42] not willing that any should perish but
[1:08:44] that all should come to repentance yes
[1:08:46] things continue on but that's just
[1:08:48] because of the love of god
[1:08:50] god doesn't allow things to go the way
[1:08:52] they are because he hates you he's
[1:08:55] allowing it to continue because he loves
[1:08:57] you
[1:08:59] because he loves humanity because he
[1:09:01] wants everyone knowing that
[1:09:04] not all will be but that everyone all
[1:09:08] flesh could come to repentance
[1:09:10] he's long-suffering he's not forgotten
[1:09:13] us he's not ignorant he's not dumb
[1:09:17] he's not negligent to his promises he's
[1:09:20] just long-suffering his grace his mercy
[1:09:23] his long-suffering to us humans
[1:09:27] who deserve hell to begin with he's
[1:09:29] long-suffering his love now when man
[1:09:32] looks at it in the carnal it looks like
[1:09:35] one thing but when you can put on the
[1:09:37] spiritual eyes let that ice have again
[1:09:40] correct your vision to where you can see
[1:09:42] the revelation of the scripture
[1:09:44] recognize this is the way it is because
[1:09:47] god loves humanity so much
[1:09:50] because he loves you so much
[1:09:52] his grace to us word his long-suffering
[1:09:55] to us work continues because that's how
[1:09:59] good he is
[1:10:00] that's just how good he is i i
[1:10:03] just in my lifetime i don't see how
[1:10:05] god's lasted i don't know how it's
[1:10:07] lasted this long
[1:10:09] i mean all of you nodding and shaking
[1:10:11] and
[1:10:12] you agree with i don't know how swamp
[1:10:13] has lasted this long i i don't see how
[1:10:16] we got to this point right but that just
[1:10:19] have to remember it's god's long
[1:10:21] suffering
[1:10:22] it's god's love his will
[1:10:24] god would his will would be that all
[1:10:27] would come to repentance
[1:10:29] but again as i've said many times god
[1:10:31] does not predestinate based on his will
[1:10:34] he predestinates based on his
[1:10:36] foreknowledge
[1:10:37] even though his will would be that all
[1:10:39] would
[1:10:40] his predestination before knowledge knew
[1:10:42] they would not
[1:10:44] unfortunately
[1:10:46] i wish they would too
[1:10:48] i don't want to see a single hurt a
[1:10:49] single soul in hell
[1:10:51] right personally i don't want to see one
[1:10:54] there will be
[1:10:56] but i don't want there to be i wish or
[1:10:58] wouldn't
[1:10:59] and that's his word says his will yes
[1:11:01] what was that what would be our will
[1:11:03] today
[1:11:04] would we want to see
[1:11:06] i know there's a lot of people in the
[1:11:07] world talk about us
[1:11:09] this new phrase that i've heard recently
[1:11:12] or in the past couple years that people
[1:11:14] come out
[1:11:15] just
[1:11:16] just foul
[1:11:19] people not good people and and and
[1:11:22] because they hear something they think
[1:11:24] is done that's worse than what they've
[1:11:26] done their phrases there must be a
[1:11:28] special place in hell
[1:11:32] for this person that did that thing
[1:11:34] and that makes me think well
[1:11:37] how special is the place that you're
[1:11:38] going to occupy
[1:11:41] i mean that's the sad reality a lot of
[1:11:43] times of it but the truth of it is
[1:11:45] people are so quick
[1:11:47] to want to and desire to see people go
[1:11:50] to hell
[1:11:52] that's not the will of god amen that's
[1:11:54] not the heart of god god's heart is in
[1:11:56] this word it says he does not want
[1:11:59] anybody to go to hell
[1:12:01] nor do i
[1:12:03] i don't think any of us here would want
[1:12:04] that right i don't care how bad you've
[1:12:06] been treated yes i don't care what
[1:12:08] anybody's done to you you don't want to
[1:12:10] see anybody go to hell yes amen right
[1:12:13] but that's his will he said his will was
[1:12:16] but he's because he's long suffering
[1:12:19] that they should come to repentance but
[1:12:22] the day of the lord will come as a thief
[1:12:24] in the night in the which the heavens
[1:12:26] shall pass away look at this now the
[1:12:28] heavens shall pass away with a great
[1:12:31] noise
[1:12:33] and and the elements the elements shall
[1:12:36] melt with fervor heat
[1:12:38] the earth also and the works that are
[1:12:41] therein shall be burned up
[1:12:44] annihilated
[1:12:46] the bible says pass away
[1:12:49] which we've talked about i'll come back
[1:12:51] to in a minute
[1:12:52] seeing then that all these things shall
[1:12:54] be dissolved
[1:12:57] what manner of persons are we to be in
[1:13:00] all holy conversation and godliness
[1:13:03] what kind of people are we to be today
[1:13:05] saints looking for and hastening unto
[1:13:08] the coming of the day of god wherein the
[1:13:10] heavens shall be on fire the heavens
[1:13:13] shall be on fire shall be dissolved and
[1:13:16] the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:13:18] heat
[1:13:20] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:13:22] look for a new heavens and a new earth
[1:13:25] wherein dwelleth righteousness and
[1:13:27] that's where this whole series is headed
[1:13:29] to
[1:13:30] amen may take several parts but this
[1:13:33] whole series is headed to that place
[1:13:36] that new heavens and that new earth that
[1:13:38] god has that he said that in john 14 1
[1:13:41] he's already got to prepare for us amen
[1:13:44] and when john saw it he saw it as a
[1:13:45] bride a door for a husband coming down
[1:13:47] on that pyramid shake mountain
[1:13:49] amen that's where we're headed saints
[1:13:51] praise the lord
[1:13:53] amen wherefore
[1:13:54] beloved seeing that ye look for such
[1:13:56] things be diligent that you be found of
[1:13:58] him in peace without spot and blameless
[1:14:01] now let's look at for a moment
[1:14:04] that um
[1:14:06] that phrase as we we've talked about
[1:14:08] before in the past that phrase pass away
[1:14:13] and the 10th verse that said the day of
[1:14:14] the lord will come as a thief in the
[1:14:15] night it's a thief in the night the
[1:14:17] thief in the night is usually something
[1:14:19] that's unexpected it's something that uh
[1:14:22] catches a person unawares
[1:14:25] now i'm going to very off of that not
[1:14:28] that that's not true because it is true
[1:14:30] but to the bride
[1:14:33] it's not a thief in the night amen to
[1:14:35] the bride she knows what's going on yeah
[1:14:38] and i don't believe it would be a shock
[1:14:40] or surprise to any of us if we were
[1:14:42] raptured out of here in the morning
[1:14:44] i don't it wasn't to me would it to you
[1:14:48] i mean i think the bride is being
[1:14:49] conditioned to the place that she's
[1:14:51] ready and she's waiting and she's
[1:14:53] looking at any moment that we're going
[1:14:54] to be caught home to be with him
[1:14:56] or we're looking for our loved ones to
[1:14:58] appear before us maybe that would negate
[1:15:00] the in the morning but uh nevertheless
[1:15:02] you see your loved ones walking around
[1:15:04] at breakfast in the morning
[1:15:05] you're essentially already there anyway
[1:15:07] so
[1:15:08] amen so that's what we're looking at
[1:15:10] waiting for so as a thief in the night
[1:15:12] well who does it catch unawares those
[1:15:14] who don't believe
[1:15:15] those who refuse to accept what god is
[1:15:18] doing yes he is long suffering but
[1:15:20] there'll be a time god's long suffering
[1:15:22] will run out and that judgment which the
[1:15:25] judgment has already started thank god
[1:15:27] there's still some grace in the world
[1:15:29] but when the bride leaves obedient with
[1:15:31] grace yes there'll be no more love amen
[1:15:33] that'll just be pure judgment that's all
[1:15:35] it'll be and this is the judgment that's
[1:15:37] hitting the earth now but right now even
[1:15:41] as this judgment is setting in god is
[1:15:43] still sending warning
[1:15:44] he always sends warning before judgment
[1:15:47] there's still warning going forth
[1:15:48] allowing people to have the opportunity
[1:15:51] get on that ark now
[1:15:53] get in that ark while there's still a
[1:15:55] chance
[1:15:56] that ark was built and you have the
[1:15:58] opportunity get in it before it's too
[1:16:01] late
[1:16:02] amen because when they finally came up
[1:16:04] knocking on the door asking no one the
[1:16:06] rain started falling asking noah open
[1:16:08] the door open the door let us in he says
[1:16:10] too late
[1:16:12] god closed the door right
[1:16:14] i can't open it
[1:16:16] not even to your cousin eddie
[1:16:19] not even to aunt phyllis i can't open
[1:16:20] the door
[1:16:22] to my nieces and nephews i i can't help
[1:16:24] you
[1:16:25] to the rest of my family to the rest of
[1:16:27] the world god closed the door
[1:16:29] i can't open it
[1:16:31] you had the chance i preached to you for
[1:16:33] 120 years and you scoffed at me
[1:16:36] you laughed at me you made fun of my
[1:16:38] beautiful great creation i have a year
[1:16:42] you thought i was an idiot for getting
[1:16:43] all these animals and things coming
[1:16:45] around and and getting on here and now
[1:16:48] you've passed over from the warnings
[1:16:51] that god gave over and over and over
[1:16:53] into the judgment
[1:16:55] you remember the story
[1:16:57] that that uh i was told many years ago
[1:17:00] of the man who was caught in a flood
[1:17:03] and the man
[1:17:04] uh
[1:17:05] finally crawled up onto the roof of his
[1:17:07] house
[1:17:08] and the flood was just rising and rising
[1:17:10] and rushing and pouring in
[1:17:12] and he was praying god help me god save
[1:17:15] me god
[1:17:16] deliver me from this
[1:17:18] and a boat comes paddling along
[1:17:20] or putting along against the motor he
[1:17:22] comes down
[1:17:23] and he stops at the man he says come get
[1:17:25] my boat
[1:17:28] i can rescue you i can help you get in
[1:17:30] my boat the guy says no no i'm waiting
[1:17:32] for god to save me i'm waiting for god
[1:17:34] to rescue
[1:17:36] okay goes on
[1:17:38] helicopter comes over drops the rope
[1:17:40] down grab the rope sir i'm here to save
[1:17:43] you grab the rope and you can be saved
[1:17:45] from this no thank you i'm waiting on
[1:17:47] god to save me
[1:17:50] the man drowns goes to heaven he says
[1:17:52] god i thought you were going to save me
[1:17:53] he said well i sent you a boat i sent
[1:17:55] you a helicopter what else did you want
[1:17:56] me to do
[1:17:58] i sent you every way i've escaped i
[1:18:00] could think this into you you rejected
[1:18:02] every one of them
[1:18:03] and all you had left was to drown
[1:18:07] that's the same thing that people were
[1:18:08] in today yes the warning continued to
[1:18:12] come
[1:18:12] the word continues to unfold god
[1:18:15] continues to bring forth that bread of
[1:18:17] life and and and the witness of his
[1:18:19] spirit around the world in this last day
[1:18:22] and people just continue to reject it
[1:18:24] the warnings continue to go but as the
[1:18:26] judgment continues to fall saints it's
[1:18:29] it it is the way it is in this day so
[1:18:31] when these golfers get to that place and
[1:18:34] that and that becomes a thief in the
[1:18:36] night to them they it's catches them
[1:18:38] unawares
[1:18:39] they look around and say what is going
[1:18:41] on in this world today
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] and god takes his bride home
[1:18:46] nothing left after that but judgment
[1:18:49] the lord will come as a thief in the
[1:18:51] night and the witch the heavens shall
[1:18:53] pass away the heavens
[1:18:55] shall pass away and the elements of the
[1:18:58] of the earth and of the heavens shall
[1:19:00] melt with fervent heat
[1:19:02] the earth also in the works that are
[1:19:04] therein shall be burned up no wonder
[1:19:06] there's no more singing
[1:19:08] we'll find out as we read it last week
[1:19:10] revelation 21 there is no more sea when
[1:19:12] he sets this new city up there's no more
[1:19:14] sea why it's all burnt up and blasted
[1:19:18] and annihilated uh not annihilated but
[1:19:20] as the word pass away here
[1:19:23] as we've said many times the word pass
[1:19:25] away is a greek word
[1:19:31] p-a-r-e-r-c-h-o-m-a-i you think i
[1:19:32] learned how to pronounce that after all
[1:19:34] this time
[1:19:35] but i haven't uh p-a-r-e-r-c-h-o-m-a-i
[1:19:40] brother branham points out that pass
[1:19:41] away that word that that that
[1:19:44] encompasses both pass away both words
[1:19:47] not just the one word but both words the
[1:19:49] phrase or the two word pass away is this
[1:19:52] one greek word pass away which means not
[1:19:54] annihilated
[1:19:56] not completely done away with where it's
[1:19:59] no longer in existence but it means
[1:20:01] passing from one form to another right
[1:20:04] amen this earth this earth and receiving
[1:20:06] its fiery baptism where the earth the
[1:20:10] atmospheres the heavens explode all the
[1:20:13] elements all the uh the germs diseases
[1:20:16] every bit of it explodes with fervent
[1:20:19] heat every bit is purified by the fire
[1:20:22] of god
[1:20:24] it explodes even to work everything
[1:20:26] about it passes away or it changes from
[1:20:30] one form to another
[1:20:32] it's just like uh
[1:20:35] uh it says in i believe it's matthew i'm
[1:20:37] trying to remember
[1:20:38] that it said where jesus said heavens
[1:20:40] and earth will pass away
[1:20:43] but my words shall never pass away
[1:20:47] or never
[1:20:48] change
[1:20:50] heavens and earth will change
[1:20:52] they will evolve they will change from
[1:20:55] the current condition to a new condition
[1:20:58] once it's all burned over but my word
[1:21:00] cannot pass away or change
[1:21:04] his word is always the same it never
[1:21:06] changes so even as heaven and earth
[1:21:09] changes his work cannot change right
[1:21:11] from one form to the other but what else
[1:21:14] does
[1:21:16] what else does
[1:21:18] what else does is you
[1:21:21] we were talking about a little bit last
[1:21:22] week what else changes from one form to
[1:21:25] another it's me it's you
[1:21:29] because this body from came from this
[1:21:32] earth
[1:21:33] god gave it a baptism he gave a blood a
[1:21:35] bath he gave it a fiery baptism this
[1:21:38] earth from which my body came changes
[1:21:41] from one form to another
[1:21:43] praise the lord it won't no longer be in
[1:21:45] this sinful condition it will be in a
[1:21:47] glorified condition where the celestial
[1:21:50] will come and take the terrestrial and
[1:21:52] we become heavenly beings
[1:21:55] praise the lord this body
[1:21:58] changes from one form to another yes
[1:22:00] like we said last week why did god care
[1:22:02] so much about this earth well it's his
[1:22:04] creation first of all but it's where you
[1:22:06] came from
[1:22:07] god took you out of the ground he
[1:22:10] created you out of the dust of the
[1:22:12] ground from the from the very beginning
[1:22:14] and adam he took you from the dust of
[1:22:16] the earth
[1:22:17] praise the lord and that dust then
[1:22:19] changes
[1:22:21] from the sinful condition that we live
[1:22:23] in today and these these time bodies
[1:22:26] become eternal beings right glorified
[1:22:30] pain changed passed away from one form
[1:22:33] to another yes oh it's just god's
[1:22:35] showing the same thing he does all the
[1:22:37] way through the scripture
[1:22:39] what he does he said well that's just
[1:22:41] miraculous to the earth but what about
[1:22:42] you
[1:22:43] or you might think well god's done that
[1:22:45] great work in me yeah but he's also
[1:22:47] doing it in others he's doing it in his
[1:22:49] creation he's doing it around the world
[1:22:52] in the world itself the heavens and the
[1:22:54] earth
[1:22:55] pass away change
[1:22:56] change forms from one form to another
[1:22:59] that pass away
[1:23:00] just means that changing it changes from
[1:23:03] one form to another
[1:23:05] now let's go over to genesis chapter 5.
[1:23:12] we're going to finish in genesis today
[1:23:15] and start back with genesis i believe
[1:23:17] next week
[1:23:19] genesis chapter 5.
[1:23:25] we'll start with verse 21.
[1:23:36] noah
[1:23:38] it was not a surprise to noah the flood
[1:23:41] was not a surprise to noah
[1:23:46] those who were looking for christ
[1:23:49] saw him
[1:23:51] it was a surprise to those who were
[1:23:53] blinded
[1:23:54] because they couldn't see him but to
[1:23:56] those who were looking for him found him
[1:23:59] today's the same
[1:24:00] thing as i said it'll be a thief in the
[1:24:03] night to the world to people that don't
[1:24:05] believe but to the bride
[1:24:09] that's her fortune that's what she's
[1:24:10] looking to what she's looking for
[1:24:13] every day of her life i believe the
[1:24:15] bride has a vision for that
[1:24:18] and that's what she's looking to
[1:24:21] the coming of the lord yes the changing
[1:24:24] of our bodies our loved ones to appear
[1:24:25] before us we're looking to that yes amen
[1:24:28] not a surprise
[1:24:29] it's something that we know no was
[1:24:32] warned
[1:24:33] of what god was about to do have we not
[1:24:35] been done the same right the second two
[1:24:38] thousand they were warned
[1:24:42] isaiah told them a virgin shall conceive
[1:24:45] they were warned they were told what was
[1:24:46] going to happen this last day same thing
[1:24:49] friend
[1:24:50] we've been told
[1:24:52] we've been warned
[1:24:53] we know what god is doing we can read it
[1:24:55] in the word and find out god had to tell
[1:24:58] noah lift the ear but god put in his
[1:25:00] word and tell us what he's doing today
[1:25:03] now as we see these
[1:25:06] uh
[1:25:08] coincide with each other these parallels
[1:25:10] that run and and all through the
[1:25:12] scripture and i'm i'm
[1:25:15] trying to see
[1:25:16] help us see how god's
[1:25:18] plan and what god does each time
[1:25:23] god is runs in continuity he does the
[1:25:25] same thing every time
[1:25:27] he uses different people he may do a
[1:25:30] different tactic or something but the
[1:25:32] same thing god does each time he does
[1:25:34] amen and every bit of it has a reason
[1:25:38] has a purpose for it now
[1:25:40] verse 21
[1:25:44] enoch lived
[1:25:46] 65 years and begot methuselah
[1:25:52] and enoch walked with god after he begot
[1:25:55] methuselah
[1:25:56] 300 years and begot sons and daughters
[1:25:59] all the days of enoch were 365 years
[1:26:02] and i've walked with god and he was not
[1:26:04] for god took him
[1:26:06] and methuselah lived in 180 and seven
[1:26:08] years begot lama
[1:26:10] methuselah lived after he begat lamech
[1:26:13] 700 uh uh 780 in two years and begot
[1:26:17] sons and daughters all the days in
[1:26:19] methuselah were
[1:26:20] 969 years you notice
[1:26:23] in this scripture
[1:26:25] god specifically points out
[1:26:28] certain
[1:26:30] ones
[1:26:31] and then he says and then he went on to
[1:26:33] have a bunch of sons and daughters
[1:26:35] but he had this one
[1:26:37] and he had this one he had a bunch of
[1:26:38] sons and daughters and he had this one
[1:26:41] and then he had a bunch of sons and
[1:26:42] daughters and this one see
[1:26:44] as god is tracing that lineage down
[1:26:47] through
[1:26:48] so that we can see and and pick
[1:26:51] how god is
[1:26:53] is exposing revealing his word for us to
[1:26:56] see
[1:26:57] today how he's doing they couldn't then
[1:27:00] but we do now as we look at it as each
[1:27:02] one goes through ina methuselah laymen
[1:27:06] 28th verse lived 12
[1:27:10] 82 years and begot and begat a son
[1:27:13] and his name now look this changed a
[1:27:15] little bit
[1:27:16] now i'm not going to tell you today why
[1:27:18] it changed
[1:27:20] but if we come next week you'll
[1:27:22] we'll get more into that but i'm not
[1:27:24] going to
[1:27:25] go to it today that takes us into next
[1:27:28] week
[1:27:29] but it changes
[1:27:30] you notice he said
[1:27:32] he had so and he was the so-and-so age
[1:27:35] he had so-and-so and he lived so and so
[1:27:37] after that
[1:27:38] but here he says lamak lived 180 in two
[1:27:41] years and begot a son
[1:27:44] and he called his name noah
[1:27:46] notice how it's very specific there
[1:27:50] his name noah saying
[1:27:53] the same shall comfort us concerning our
[1:27:55] work and toil of our hands because of
[1:27:57] the ground which the lord had cursed now
[1:27:59] it doesn't give any other description
[1:28:01] like that with any of the others
[1:28:03] but for noah it does
[1:28:05] we'll find out more about that next week
[1:28:08] and lamech lived after he begot noah 590
[1:28:11] in five years and begot sons and
[1:28:13] daughters and all the days of lama were
[1:28:15] 77 years and he died and noah was 500
[1:28:20] years old and noah begat shem ham and
[1:28:22] jacob now
[1:28:25] in the in the light in the last few
[1:28:27] minutes we have here in the light of
[1:28:29] recognizing
[1:28:31] that god warns noah first of all and
[1:28:34] told noah what he was going to do
[1:28:36] but in light of understanding the time
[1:28:39] frame because see god told us what he's
[1:28:42] going to do correct he says i'm coming
[1:28:44] again i will come and i will take you
[1:28:47] that where i am you shall be also. so we
[1:28:49] know there's going to be a rapture we
[1:28:51] know there's going to be a catching away
[1:28:52] we know that god in these last days is
[1:28:55] going to take his bride home with him so
[1:28:57] we know that that's a that's a blanket
[1:28:59] stadium
[1:29:02] statement that we all know that's in the
[1:29:04] scripture that
[1:29:06] is
[1:29:07] just like god telling noah i'm gonna let
[1:29:10] it rain
[1:29:11] rain is gonna flood the earth build me
[1:29:13] an ark
[1:29:14] same blanket statement see
[1:29:17] jesus is coming a messiah is coming but
[1:29:21] how many people recognized what was
[1:29:23] going to happen to the messiah once he
[1:29:25] got here
[1:29:28] who knew
[1:29:29] what was going to take place
[1:29:32] who was it going to be how long was he
[1:29:34] going to be here
[1:29:35] how many years was going to be his
[1:29:37] ministry and what was going to be his
[1:29:38] demise
[1:29:40] amen unless you look back and really
[1:29:43] studied the torah the scripture to
[1:29:45] recognize
[1:29:46] as david crying out in several places
[1:29:49] about how they nailed his hands and his
[1:29:51] feet you wouldn't know
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:54] but search the scripture
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:57] search the scripture look
[1:30:00] noah had a blanket statement god told
[1:30:02] him warned him i'm gonna it's gonna rain
[1:30:05] i'm going to destroy humanity i'm going
[1:30:07] to destroy botany life animal life and
[1:30:09] human life off the planet with water and
[1:30:12] he knew that but now how did he know
[1:30:15] when to get on the boat how did he know
[1:30:17] now you say well the ark is finished
[1:30:19] time to get in
[1:30:20] no not necessarily
[1:30:23] it's got to be in god's timing
[1:30:25] not yours yes
[1:30:27] i see how easy we get we think oh well
[1:30:30] it just makes sense i'm done with the
[1:30:31] boat time to get on
[1:30:33] that makes common sense sure doesn't it
[1:30:35] but is that equating to god's timing
[1:30:38] because that's all that matters is god's
[1:30:40] timing so what did god god says get on
[1:30:42] the boat but you never read anywhere
[1:30:44] where god said get on
[1:30:46] amen so there's again to the day that we
[1:30:51] live
[1:30:52] just like it was not a surprise to know
[1:30:54] what god was going to do
[1:30:56] he told it to abraham when he destroyed
[1:30:58] sodom and gomorrah that wasn't one of
[1:31:00] our
[1:31:00] change over 2000 major year major
[1:31:03] occurrence but god told abraham what he
[1:31:05] was going to do to sodom and gomorrah he
[1:31:07] said i i wouldn't dare do this without
[1:31:09] telling my prophet without telling my
[1:31:11] son amen and he didn't he told him
[1:31:14] and he does the same thing he did the
[1:31:16] same thing with noah
[1:31:18] he does the same thing with his children
[1:31:19] today with his bride today
[1:31:22] when is it going to be
[1:31:25] well
[1:31:26] we can know here
[1:31:27] lamont lived
[1:31:29] or methuselah lived
[1:31:31] 969 years
[1:31:33] and as we have said here before
[1:31:37] we do know
[1:31:39] that
[1:31:41] the meaning of methuselah's name you
[1:31:44] remember the meaning of methuselah's
[1:31:46] name
[1:31:48] methuselah was named by enoch
[1:31:50] who pleased god walked with god and was
[1:31:53] raptured
[1:31:55] so
[1:31:56] before god could begin to deal with noah
[1:31:59] who wasn't even born yet but could begin
[1:32:01] to deal with that end of the world
[1:32:04] scenario he had to take enoch off the
[1:32:07] scene so enoch typing the bride had to
[1:32:10] leave
[1:32:11] amen just like
[1:32:14] in this day this the bride goes home
[1:32:17] to deal with the end of time end of life
[1:32:20] not time life their scenario the flood
[1:32:24] methuselah was named by enoch that man
[1:32:28] that pleased god walked with god
[1:32:30] methuselah's name as we've read here
[1:32:32] before
[1:32:34] means when he dies when methuselah dies
[1:32:37] there shall be an omniscient an emission
[1:32:40] or a sending forth of waters upon the
[1:32:44] earth
[1:32:45] that was the meaning of methuselah's
[1:32:47] name who was named by enoch
[1:32:51] essentially
[1:32:52] enoch told noah
[1:32:54] exactly when to get on the ark by naming
[1:32:57] methuselah
[1:32:59] and when he named methuselah
[1:33:01] noah could then understand that of
[1:33:04] course catch that revelation
[1:33:06] and as he caught the revelation to
[1:33:08] understand that methuselah's name meant
[1:33:11] this that when methuselah died it was
[1:33:13] time to get on amen whether he created a
[1:33:16] finished york a week two weeks a month
[1:33:18] the year before that
[1:33:21] was irrelevant
[1:33:22] amen amen the point was it's time to get
[1:33:26] on
[1:33:27] the time is done
[1:33:30] the the end is now
[1:33:32] when methuselah died
[1:33:34] he died in the same year and thank god
[1:33:37] appreciate brother pat you can go
[1:33:38] through the description you can figure
[1:33:40] all this out brother pat's put it on
[1:33:41] those charts that we have over there and
[1:33:43] and when i'm looking at this again i
[1:33:45] referred to them because it made it easy
[1:33:47] i can look but
[1:33:49] god but noah knew
[1:33:51] because of enoch when it was time to get
[1:33:54] on the ark because of methuselah because
[1:33:57] the
[1:33:58] the meaning of methuselah's name now
[1:34:00] remember that meaning of a name names
[1:34:03] always mean something
[1:34:05] they always do remember brother said if
[1:34:06] you've if you've named your son ricky or
[1:34:09] uh elvis or something he said change
[1:34:11] that name
[1:34:12] the nature of that kid you'll want to
[1:34:14] change that name and you see sometimes
[1:34:16] uh certain natures and i think my
[1:34:19] what name was tacked to that kid you
[1:34:21] know
[1:34:22] uh because it makes a difference yes
[1:34:26] it makes a difference i mean
[1:34:28] that's not all there is to it that a
[1:34:30] person's name isn't all the reason
[1:34:32] they're a referee a lot of times it's
[1:34:36] parent delinquency but that name has a
[1:34:38] lot to do with it
[1:34:40] it does see so
[1:34:42] that name that methuselah we'll talk
[1:34:44] about the name again next week but the
[1:34:46] but the name methuselah
[1:34:48] when he dies shall be
[1:34:50] an emission a sending forth of water
[1:34:52] going that noah knew
[1:34:54] that when methuselah died
[1:34:57] that it was time to get on the ark now
[1:34:59] notice something
[1:35:01] his
[1:35:02] father lama
[1:35:04] died before
[1:35:06] his dad methuselah
[1:35:09] five years ish give or take
[1:35:12] about five years before methuselah died
[1:35:14] and noah got on the ark his dad lament
[1:35:17] died
[1:35:18] and did you notice
[1:35:20] what lamont's
[1:35:24] age was
[1:35:25] when he died
[1:35:27] seven seven seven
[1:35:30] wow
[1:35:32] perfect completion
[1:35:36] three is the word number for perfect set
[1:35:38] is the number of completion
[1:35:41] perfectly complete just a few years
[1:35:43] before methuselah
[1:35:45] well don't you think now it doesn't tell
[1:35:47] us scripturally i didn't find brother
[1:35:49] madam said this but don't you think
[1:35:52] that in understanding the names and the
[1:35:55] times and things that god's dealing with
[1:35:57] know at this time that when he took his
[1:36:00] father at 777 that meant something to
[1:36:03] him
[1:36:05] he was even to me that greater of a
[1:36:08] warning to say it is imminent
[1:36:12] i believe that's the time period we're
[1:36:13] living right now
[1:36:14] honestly that that's me i believe that
[1:36:17] this is the time period that we're
[1:36:19] leaving living right now that triple
[1:36:22] that that perfect completion that
[1:36:24] finished it all off even before
[1:36:26] methuselah because when methuselah died
[1:36:30] and noah got on the ark
[1:36:32] that was the completion of the souls
[1:36:34] that are in prison
[1:36:36] to me now
[1:36:37] the scripture doesn't say it brother i
[1:36:39] don't see where brother brown says it
[1:36:40] but we do know
[1:36:42] scripturally and by the prophet that
[1:36:45] there will be a period of time to where
[1:36:47] we will be on this earth and there will
[1:36:50] be no ability for anyone else to be
[1:36:52] saved
[1:36:54] we do know that we know that by the ark
[1:36:57] because they got on the ark may 17th
[1:37:00] but it didn't start raining until may
[1:37:02] 24th
[1:37:03] a whole week
[1:37:05] before it started raining they're
[1:37:06] sitting there on the ark with no rain
[1:37:09] yet
[1:37:10] but god put them there for that reason
[1:37:12] but at that point god shut the door and
[1:37:15] there was nobody could get in and nobody
[1:37:16] could get out right
[1:37:18] there's going to be that period of time
[1:37:21] personally i've told you this myself
[1:37:23] personally my own
[1:37:25] opinion revelation of it is i think
[1:37:27] that's going to be the time where the
[1:37:29] dead appear before us amen and we have
[1:37:31] that period of time where the dead are
[1:37:33] with us
[1:37:34] but
[1:37:35] that period before the rapture is going
[1:37:37] to be that period of time and i believe
[1:37:39] at that period of time there'll be no
[1:37:41] nobody can be saved at that time
[1:37:43] all that's going to go in is in
[1:37:46] but the but the perfect complete
[1:37:49] completion of lamech
[1:37:52] i believe is going on right now
[1:37:54] because we're at that we're
[1:37:56] we are in an understanding
[1:37:58] of the time frames and periods that god
[1:38:01] is working in for us at this time for
[1:38:04] this prime brother branham has been gone
[1:38:06] for
[1:38:07] 56 going on 57 years now
[1:38:10] you think man how can you do such good
[1:38:12] math i told you i died i bore i was born
[1:38:14] 10 days before he passed away so it's
[1:38:16] easy math as long as i remember how old
[1:38:18] i am
[1:38:20] 56
[1:38:21] so it'd be 57 coming up in december he's
[1:38:24] been gone that long
[1:38:25] so if we were that close then how much
[1:38:28] closer are we now i know a thousand
[1:38:30] years is one day one day a thousand
[1:38:32] years but i'm looking at the scripture
[1:38:34] and the realization of what god did in
[1:38:36] the andalusian world what god did
[1:38:38] through jesus christ and what he's doing
[1:38:39] in this last day we're at that time yeah
[1:38:43] the perfect completion that noah saw
[1:38:45] with his dad passing and then a few
[1:38:48] years later methuselah dying it was time
[1:38:50] to get on the ark and then no flesh
[1:38:52] could be saved
[1:38:53] i believe there's still mercy saying yes
[1:38:55] yes i believe there's still grace i
[1:38:57] still believe there we're in a period of
[1:38:59] time where people can be saved now i do
[1:39:02] believe we're probably out there
[1:39:04] gleaning in fact i know we are brother
[1:39:06] branham said it 60 years ago that we
[1:39:08] were just gleaning
[1:39:09] uh maybe one here one there but as long
[1:39:12] as
[1:39:13] we are doing what we're called to do
[1:39:16] whether it's here or there uh
[1:39:19] this country another country this city
[1:39:21] another city doesn't matter
[1:39:23] let us be found faithful about the post
[1:39:26] amen doing the father's business because
[1:39:29] we can see here that god
[1:39:31] uh continues to show us
[1:39:34] what he's doing now by showing us what
[1:39:38] he did then
[1:39:40] amen
[1:39:41] and as noah knew it i believe we know it
[1:39:45] as it was revealed to noah i believe it
[1:39:47] becomes revealed to us
[1:39:49] and we can see that
[1:39:50] and god continues to show us what day
[1:39:53] we're living in and where we're at now i
[1:39:54] want you to keep in mind
[1:39:56] and hold
[1:39:58] that meaning of methuselah
[1:40:00] and the significance
[1:40:03] may give you some
[1:40:05] study tips if you want to go home before
[1:40:07] next sunday
[1:40:08] that
[1:40:10] that god made in the scripture
[1:40:12] about lama description of noah and why
[1:40:16] he went into such descriptive
[1:40:18] uh
[1:40:20] talking about noah
[1:40:22] why that he changed from he had a son he
[1:40:25] had sons and daughters died son sons
[1:40:27] daughters died and then all of a sudden
[1:40:29] he had a son
[1:40:31] he named him noah
[1:40:33] and it was because of this this and this
[1:40:35] because that becomes very significant
[1:40:37] for what we want to talk about next week
[1:40:39] amen they stand if we could
[1:40:44] praise the lord
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:51] god is good yes he is his word is

[1:41:02] god will not leave us without
[1:41:04] representation

[1:41:08] which just means you just don't know
[1:41:10] doesn't mean you're dumb or stupid it
[1:41:12] just means you just don't know god's not
[1:41:13] going to leave a sacrament
[1:41:15] amend the bride he lets her know

[1:41:20] i didn't marry my wife and then take her

[1:41:24] bar somewhere or go do something and
[1:41:27] she's sitting there where did he go
[1:41:29] no
[1:41:31] if i did anything it was first of all
[1:41:33] with her
[1:41:35] and if we did anything i would tell her
[1:41:38] unless it was a surprise but
[1:41:40] i let her know
[1:41:42] he lets us know
[1:41:43] he shows us he reveals it to us amen
[1:41:47] praise the lord i'm thankful for that
