[18:59] requests to mention to you today. Got a
[19:01] text from Sharia
[19:03] little bit before church. She said that
[19:05] uh her and the family had gotten sick.
[19:08] That remember last week Art wasn't
[19:10] feeling well. We prayed for them not to,
[19:12] but they did catch it anyway. They're
[19:14] getting over it, but wanted to stay home
[19:16] and just stream. Hopefully, they're
[19:17] streaming. God bless you. Uh to uh make
[19:20] sure they're healed and
[19:23] stop it there. Don't want to spread
[19:25] spread it to anybody else. So, amen.
[19:27] We're just thankful that the Lord has
[19:29] blessed them and touched it, continue to
[19:31] heal them. Uh also, God, she didn't
[19:35] think she's going to be here, but she
[19:36] made it.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; I thought it was going to be really
[19:40] late. Yeah, she made it here for the
[19:42] prayer request. Uh, but she did send a
[19:45] one in that was asking for her husband
[19:48] Ronnie. Sister Norma's husband Ronnie is
[19:50] sick. Uh, so maybe a little bit late
[19:52] this morning. So, please remember him in
[19:54] prayer. Sister Norman asked me to hold
[19:56] Ronnie in prayer. Also, she asked for uh
[20:00] her nephew, and I hope I got this right,
[20:03] Jesse. Was it Jesse?
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really, but I call him Jesse.

[20:21] foot's better as we all know. He's home
[20:23] now and text him I think it was
[20:25] yesterday. Uh maybe I text him Friday
[20:28] night to see how he was doing. I worked
[20:30] about 12 hours Friday. So it kind of
[20:33] slipped me during the day. But when I
[20:34] got home and I was kind of resting and
[20:37] gotten some dinner, I uh I text him and
[20:40] he I think he text me back later later
[20:42] that night and I had already gone to
[20:43] bed. Uh so I text him back Saturday and
[20:46] we text a little bit. He's doing he's
[20:48] doing good, feeling better. It's going
[20:50] to it's going to be a little road. He's
[20:52] taking he's got a pick line and he's
[20:53] taking some uh high potent antibiotics
[20:57] uh to continue to help take care of that
[20:58] foot. So please remember him in prayer.
[21:01] Uh there's no antibiotic that the
[21:03] doctors have ever come up with that's
[21:04] any better than the prayer of the
[21:06] saints. That's the best antibiotic that
[21:08] I know of. Amen. So your prayers to him
[21:12] go to Dennis. Amen. Will bring healing
[21:14] to his body. So we believe that and
[21:17] touch brother Dennis um and just
[21:20] continue to hold him before the Lord.
[21:22] Amen. So praise the Lord. It's good to
[21:25] be in the house of the Lord.

[24:40] Jesus, to speak to our hearts and souls,
[24:42] so we can apply whatever it is that you
[24:43] have for us to our lives and leave this
[24:45] place better than what we can.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Commit everything and ask everything in
[24:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[24:51] ask it.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. You can be
[24:55] seated if you'd like. Amen.
[24:58] Come on my heart. As soon as Micah
[25:00] started praying about Tabitha and Zack,
[25:03] Tabith
[25:06] having put their little snow down this
[25:07] week. I know it was hard on the
[25:09] children. Uh but um and and Tabitha, I
[25:13] know too, but so please remember in
[25:15] prayer. Just takes a little bit of a
[25:18] toll, especially this first time the
[25:20] children have experienced anything like
[25:22] that in their lives. So it's it's hit
[25:26] Micah and Emma very hard.
[25:30] Joel and Emma very hard um because they
[25:32] were very close. In fact, Snow slept
[25:34] with Micah a lot. So, um a lot of you
[25:37] have had pets and have lost pets and
[25:39] kind of knowing when you're a child,
[25:40] it's a little bit even Well, I don't
[25:42] know. We're all I guess we're all
[25:44] children, I guess, because it I remember
[25:46] we had to put Rosie down a few years
[25:48] ago. It hit me hard. I still think about
[25:50] her a lot. Uh she was my writing buddy.
[25:52] when I was writing my book, Rosie would
[25:54] come in and sit in the chair right
[25:56] behind me and watch me write as she
[25:58] slept. But anyway, I appreciate your
[26:00] prayers for them as well. Amen. The Lord
[26:03] knows. So, amen. God is mindful.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's reason for everything.
[26:09] Praise the Lord. We're going to go over
[26:10] to psalm number 204 now. Uh 204 in the
[26:14] song book here. We'll have it on the
[26:16] screen for us here. At home, got a book.
[26:19] I usually read the book and number some
[26:21] stay home. I Pat may uh have a book

[27:17] Oh, what a day
[27:19] that will be when my Jesus
[27:24] I shall see.

[27:32] saves me by his grace. When he takes me
[27:38] by the hand and leads me through that
[27:43] promised land. Oh, what a day, glorious
[27:48] day
[27:50] that will be
[27:53] this now. There'll be no
[27:57] sorrow there.
[27:59] No more burdens
[28:02] to bear.
[28:04] No more sickness.
[28:06] No pain.
[28:09] No more parting
[28:11] over there.
[28:13] And forever
[28:16] I will be with the one who died for me.
[28:22] What a day,
[28:25] glorious day
[28:27] that will be. Oh, hallelujah.
[28:31] Yes. What a day
[28:33] that will be.
[28:36] When by Jesus
[28:38] I shall see. When I look upon his face,
[28:44] the one who saved me by his grace. when
[28:50] he takes me by the hand and he leads me
[28:55] through that promised land. Oh, what a
[28:59] day,
[29:00] glorious day
[29:03] that will be. Oh, can we sing that last
[29:05] verse again?

[29:48] When my Jesus I shall see. When I look
[29:54] upon his face. The one who saved me by
[29:59] his grace. when he takes me by the hand
[30:05] and he leads me through that promised
[30:09] land. Oh, what a day. Glorious day

[30:18] Hallelujah.
[30:20] Oh, what a day, saints. What a day,
[30:22] saints.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; I know we've all imagined it. at all.
[30:26] We've all tried to figure it our minds
[30:28] and just think about what the beauty of
[30:30] it is going to be. But just remember,
[30:33] eyes not seen, ears not heard, even in
[30:35] the inner of the heart of man, what
[30:37] God's got in store. The beauty, Amen,
[30:40] that's in store for his bride.
[30:43] Hallelujah. The peacefulness, the love,
[30:46] Amen. We're all beneficiaries of the
[30:49] grace of God, the benefits of God. Amen.
[30:53] what God has in store. Praise his holy
[30:56] name. Amen.
[30:59] Looking forward to that time. Any day
[31:01] now. Amen. He said any day now. Praise
[31:04] the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Anyone
[31:08] have a testimony or something on your
[31:10] heart this morning.
[31:15] Amen. Yes, Sister
[31:20] God's goodness.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:29] for us.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Every day.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; So true.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; My isn't that beautiful.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Just to think about that sentence. The
[31:42] wisdom of God.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Speak to a prophet.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Store up that food. Praise the
[31:50] Lord.
[31:52] Now, we are the beneficiaries to be able
[31:54] to partake of that food anytime we want.
[31:57] We've been privileged in this country,
[31:59] too, saints. We're going to be the one.
[32:01] We're going to be the group that is the
[32:02] most without excuse.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he came to America. He
[32:07] came to the United States. He came and
[32:09] spoke English. I I probably got even
[32:12] less of an excuse than you do because
[32:15] when he says shinny up a tree, I know
[32:17] what he's talking about. You might not.
[32:19] I do. when he's uh I forgot what I
[32:22] explained the other day. Some verbiage
[32:24] that he used. I I I speak southern. I
[32:27] know what he's talking about when he's
[32:29] sane. When I was talking about saying
[32:30] the other day, I don't know how many of
[32:32] you knew what that was, but I felt I
[32:34] should explain it. Maybe you didn't know
[32:36] what s is. Uh I know I've done it as a
[32:39] kid. So, I probably even got less of an
[32:42] excuse. We have there. Amen. To listen.
[32:45] We have it on the internet. We have it
[32:48] in MP3s. We've got it pod players. We
[32:52] got it on our phones and tablet. There's
[32:55] We are without excuse. We can still read
[32:57] books, too. We still There's still books
[33:00] that are out there you can read. We have
[33:02] some on the table over there. I've got
[33:04] some in my bookshelf. Got plenty at
[33:06] home. Amen. A lot of them people started
[33:08] just giving me books and books and books
[33:10] because nobody reads anymore. Everybody
[33:12] listens now. And I personally kind of
[33:14] like to listen myself because there's
[33:16] some things you can get from his voice
[33:18] that you're listening that you can't
[33:19] read out of a book. But u my personal
[33:22] preference when I can I like to listen
[33:24] and read at the same time uh and follow
[33:27] through. Uh it just makes a difference.
[33:29] But anyway, we're without excuse. Thank
[33:31] God for that food. Amen.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Anyone
[33:36] else?
[33:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see you
[33:41] each other. Let's stand to our feet if
[33:42] we could. We're just going to go into
[33:44] the scripture here now. Going back to
[33:46] Ephesians chapter 4.
[33:49] Amen. Ephesians chapter 4. We are still
[33:52] on adoption. Amen. This is adoption part
[33:55] 37. Five-fold ministry part 10. And this
[33:58] is pastors part two, I guess you'd say.
[34:01] I haven't kind of labeled it that way,
[34:02] but that's kind of what it is. This is
[34:04] pastors part two, but it's five-fold
[34:07] ministry part 10.
[34:09] Pastors part two. We got another part of
[34:11] the pastors we want to talk about. I
[34:13] guess it maybe is um not as confusing as
[34:17] the uh uh prophets as we said, but
[34:21] pastors probably encompasses more
[34:23] because uh it it's not just earthly
[34:26] pastors at pastors local assemblies, but
[34:29] we are under the great pastor. Amen.
[34:32] It's not just us local shepherds, but we
[34:34] are under the great heavenly shepherd.
[34:36] Praise the Lord. So, it encompasses
[34:38] quite a quite a bit when we look at what
[34:40] God speaks on when it comes to pastors.
[34:42] So, uh we're going to continue with the
[34:44] thoughts that the Lord gave us today.
[34:46] But we're going to begin reading in
[34:47] Ephesians 4 again. Ephesians 4 verse 11.
[34:54] Amen. Before we do, let's bow our heads
[34:55] for a word of prayer again. Lord,
[34:58] Father, it is it is a privilege, Lord,
[35:00] to be able to bow our heads and to call
[35:02] on your name. It is a privilege to know
[35:04] you, Lord, and to know you in the power
[35:06] of your resurrection. It is a privilege,
[35:08] Lord, to be able to approach your throne
[35:10] of grace boldly because you know that in
[35:14] us, you have already paved the way for
[35:16] us, Father. You went to Calvary. You
[35:18] bled. You died so we wouldn't have to.
[35:21] You became and took on our sins so that
[35:23] we could take on your righteousness,
[35:26] Lord. And today, Father, as we bow our
[35:28] heads, we certainly want to give notice
[35:31] that we're thankful. We're so very
[35:33] thankful, God, of that. Lord, it doesn't
[35:36] get old to us. I know we say it a lot,
[35:38] Lord, but it doesn't get old to us. To
[35:41] us, it's a part of your bride. Us it's
[35:43] your children. Lord, it doesn't get old
[35:45] to us to give you worship, to give you
[35:47] praise, to glorify and to magnify your
[35:49] name and to give the the the glory of
[35:52] the benefits and the acknowledgement of
[35:54] the things you've done for us. Lord,
[35:56] it's so beautiful. We thank you, Lord,
[35:58] to be able to open up the pages of this
[36:00] Bible and realize that as we read these
[36:02] words, God, you bring that word off of
[36:05] that page and make it live in our
[36:07] hearts, Lord. and help it Lord to draw
[36:09] us closer to you because it helps make
[36:12] us more like you. That revelation off
[36:14] that word becomes a part of who we are.
[36:16] And if we become a part of who we are
[36:18] and that word Lord, we become a part of
[36:20] you because that word is you. And we
[36:23] become that word we are Lord united with
[36:26] you father as one. God let it be to us
[36:29] Lord. A recognition, a realization, a
[36:32] truth that we live. Father God bless it
[36:36] now Father's main part of this word Lord
[36:39] this service God let it be according to
[36:42] your perfect will anoint speaker here
[36:44] alike let all that be done accomplished
[36:47] according to your perfect will we
[36:49] committed it to our hands again the
[36:50] remaining part here in the name of the
[36:52] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amens
[36:57] 4:11
[37:00] let's read here and he gave some
[37:02] apostles and some prophets and some
[37:04] evangelists and some pastors and
[37:06] teachers for the perfecting of the
[37:08] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[37:10] for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[37:12] So we all come in the unity of the faith
[37:15] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[37:17] unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
[37:20] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[37:23] You can be seated if you'd like.
[37:26] Amen.
[37:28] I want to again reiterate here uh as we
[37:31] look at this pastors uh from this
[37:34] scripture reading
[37:37] in the Greek the shepherd. Shepherd
[37:39] remember we talked about pastors
[37:41] shepherds interchangeable uh pastor
[37:43] shepherd a pastor is a shepherd amen we
[37:46] know that God is our great shepherd.
[37:49] Amen. Uh we are God's sheep. God made us
[37:52] sheep. Praise the Lord. Remember, sheep
[37:55] uh have to be led. Amen. Sheep can't be
[37:58] driven. Sheep have to be led. If a sheep
[38:00] gets lost, he's lost. Amen. Uh I I've
[38:05] heard of stories that you could take a
[38:07] dog across town and let him loose and
[38:09] he'll find his way back home. You could
[38:11] take a cat I've heard of taking cats and
[38:14] other different animals like that. You
[38:16] can set them out and uh 20 miles away
[38:18] and they'll sometimes somehow find their
[38:20] way back home.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if anybody's ever
[38:23] experienced that. I've heard stories
[38:24] like that. A sheep can't do that. When a
[38:27] sheep's lost, a sheep's lost. He has no
[38:29] way back. He has no way to get back to
[38:32] where he was. Amen. That's why he has to
[38:35] be led. That's why it's so important
[38:37] that the pastor keeps the sheep on the
[38:39] straight and narrow that keeps his sheep
[38:42] going in the paths of righteousness, in
[38:44] the paths of truth. Amen. And we are
[38:46] God's sheep. And God God puts us as
[38:49] pastors, as shepherds under the great
[38:51] shepherd to to do that, to lead his
[38:54] sheep and to guide his sheep. Amen. We
[38:57] are his we are his uh we are his sheep.
[39:00] We all are. But the pastors now are
[39:02] shepherds. Remember interchangeable
[39:05] uh again
[39:07] great honor here that that it says in
[39:11] the Greek the word pastors a part a
[39:13] portion of this he to whose care and
[39:16] control others have committed themselves
[39:20] and whose precepts they follow. Just
[39:22] wanted to reiterate that one more time.
[39:24] He toss care and control others have
[39:27] committed themselves and whose precepts
[39:30] they follow. remember spiritual welfare.
[39:32] Those who's placed their spiritual
[39:34] welfare under the care of a shepherd, a
[39:37] pastor, because they trust that pastor
[39:40] after they place their spiritual welfare
[39:42] under that that that's why it talks
[39:44] about the umbrella of a church. Uh why
[39:47] it talks about the protection of a
[39:48] church in the scripture. Brother
[39:49] Brandham talks about the protection of a
[39:52] church. Amen. and and the very rare
[39:56] uh utilize taking someone from out from
[39:59] under the blood. Uh what he what he's
[40:02] what he's saying is uh a lot of people
[40:04] misconstrue that taking out from under
[40:06] the blood that umbrella of that church.
[40:09] When a person comes in and becomes a
[40:11] part of us, they come under the umbrella
[40:14] protection of that church. Amen. Under
[40:16] that pastor and under your prayers.
[40:19] Amen. and they come under that and when
[40:21] they fall out or open sin or something
[40:24] and uh things like that and they're
[40:26] they're out in the world uh or or try to
[40:29] present themselves as one and uh you
[40:32] send people to go try to talk to that
[40:33] person, try to reason that person, try
[40:35] to get that person to come out of sin,
[40:37] back into the truth, back into the word.
[40:39] If they refuse and they refuse, uh you
[40:42] can take that person, the the church can
[40:44] literally take that person out from
[40:46] under the blood. Now, that doesn't take
[40:48] them out of the blood of Christ. That
[40:51] takes them out of the blood of the
[40:53] protection of this congregation of this
[40:55] church. That serves notice that that
[40:58] individual is no longer under the
[41:01] protection protective prayers of this
[41:03] church. Amen. You know, I know that
[41:06] sounds hard, but that's what the
[41:08] scripture says. Uh uh you know he talks
[41:12] about tough love and um uh uh
[41:18] praying for them the destruction of
[41:20] their flesh their soul might be saved
[41:22] because that's what we're looking for is
[41:24] the salvation of the soul not for the
[41:26] betterment of their flesh. A lot of
[41:28] people want the betterment of the flesh.
[41:29] That's why a lot of people think if you
[41:31] don't follow the way they want to live
[41:32] that you hate them. But that's not true.
[41:34] We want the betterment of their person
[41:36] but not their flesh but their soul. We
[41:38] want their soul to go to heaven.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; We don't want their soul to die, go to
[41:41] hell, be lost. And that's the whole
[41:43] point. They come out from under the
[41:45] protection of a church of that that we
[41:48] say taking out from under the blood or
[41:49] protection of this church. But that
[41:51] doesn't mean God can't still deal with
[41:53] them. That doesn't mean God's not still
[41:55] uh working on that person. Amen. Uh God
[41:58] can still do that. Uh and still does,
[42:01] especially if it's his, he will continue
[42:03] to do. If the person's not his, well
[42:06] then that person just doesn't belong to
[42:08] God. They're not one of his sheep. So
[42:10] he's not responsible for one that's not
[42:12] his.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh that that taking
[42:16] out from under whose care and control
[42:19] others have committed themselves. Amen.
[42:22] And which precepts they follow. The
[42:25] presiding now that's the that's the
[42:27] spiritual part of a pastor.
[42:30] The physical part of a pastor is the
[42:33] presiding officer, manager, director of
[42:35] any assembly. That's the physical
[42:37] attribute of a pastor. His his
[42:40] responsibility
[42:42] uh physically, naturally uh in a
[42:44] congregation. The spiritual is the
[42:46] control of the precepts. Amen.
[42:48] Doctrines, truths, the word uh that they
[42:51] follow. That's the pastor's care and
[42:53] position that they fall under. Now, we
[42:55] know that God is our pastor. We know
[42:58] that God is our great shepherd. Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Let's go over to Psalms 100.
[43:06] And I want to read a scripture, a verse
[43:08] of scripture here out of Psalms 100 and
[43:11] start getting into that that that
[43:14] crossover, if you will, that should be
[43:18] the the the resemblance of
[43:22] the crossover between the great shepherd
[43:25] uh and the local shepherds. There is a
[43:29] crossover. There is a there is a truth.
[43:31] There is a likeness. There is a way that
[43:34] that truth that that local shepherd is
[43:36] supposed to emulate the great shepherd.
[43:39] And then and getting us to this place
[43:41] when uh when David is crying out in this
[43:44] Psalms 100. Um
[43:47] let's just go to the third verse. Read
[43:49] here. Psalms 100 verse three. Know ye
[43:53] that the Lord he is God.
[43:56] It is he that hath made us
[44:00] and not we ourselves.
[44:02] We are his people
[44:05] and the sheep of his pasture. Amen. We
[44:09] are the sheep of his pasture. Praise the
[44:12] Lord that God puts us in that place of
[44:15] each one in the position uh of being
[44:18] under him. And under him we have the
[44:22] local assemblies. Remember God uh God
[44:25] said that he wouldn't always strive with
[44:27] man. He wouldn't always uh he wouldn't
[44:30] talk lip to lip to ear in that way but
[44:34] uh he would send them prophets and he
[44:36] would send them pastors and he would
[44:37] send them those as mouthpieces as
[44:40] representatives of his to orchestrate
[44:43] that care here on earth. And that's why
[44:46] he's put pastors in that position. And
[44:49] we are the sheep of his pasture. We are
[44:52] his sheep. Amen. And he is our shepherd.
[44:54] Now, Psalms 23, a very familiar
[44:57] scripture.
[45:00] We want to go through, some of us,
[45:02] probably most of us might even actually
[45:04] be able to quote this by heart, but I
[45:06] want to look at this real close. Uh go
[45:09] over it uh a bit at a time, if you will.
[45:12] Amen. Describes
[45:15] uh the way a lot of the way in which the
[45:18] Lord and which the local pastor is
[45:20] supposed to um uh take care of the
[45:24] sheep, take care of his flock. Psalms
[45:27] 23, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
[45:31] want. Because he is my shepherd, I want
[45:34] for nothing. Remember, a sheep is
[45:37] defenseless. A sheep gets lost, it's
[45:40] lost. It can't defend itself from its
[45:42] predators. You know, the sheep is like
[45:45] one of the only animals or reptiles or
[45:48] anything that really has no defense
[45:50] mechanism.
[45:51] I mean, you have some like a turtle. A
[45:53] turtle doesn't do much, but it can at
[45:55] least go into his shell.
[45:58] You got certain lizards and certain a
[46:00] snake. Uh, a a snake can be gotten in so
[46:03] many ways, but it has a defense
[46:05] mechanism. Almost fish uh there's fish
[46:10] in the ocean. They might not can bite
[46:12] you necessarily, but they can blow
[46:14] themselves up. If you touch them, it'll
[46:16] poison you.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; I I don't know the names of a lot of the
[46:19] stuff. I just know things, you know. Uh
[46:21] that's their defense mechanism. Uh uh
[46:25] jellyfish and uh I think it's what is
[46:28] it? Uh octopus can spray ink or some
[46:32] black stuff or something. They all they
[46:34] all ways to camouflage themselves.
[46:37] There's lizards can go on a tree and can
[46:39] make themselves look just like the tree.
[46:41] So the bird or whatever can't find them
[46:43] to get them. They all have defense
[46:45] mechanism. The sheep doesn't have a
[46:46] defense mechanism. It's completely,
[46:49] fully, totally dependent on the
[46:51] shepherd. Has no way. If a wolf comes,
[46:54] he has nothing to to defeat that wolf.
[46:56] He has nothing to come against that
[46:58] wolf. He just lays his life down. He
[47:01] just lays down and dies because he's got
[47:03] no defense. There's no way he can
[47:05] overcome bear, wolf, lion, anything come
[47:09] in to try to take it. The the the sheep
[47:11] has no way to defend itself. It's fully
[47:14] dependent on the shepherd.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's just the way we all
[47:18] are. We have no defense me mechanism.
[47:21] Only thing we have is him. That's what
[47:24] our our lives are all built around
[47:26] prayer because our prayer is our
[47:28] communication with the Lord. And the
[47:30] Lord is our defense me defense
[47:32] mechanism. He's the one that takes care
[47:34] of our enemy. We have no control over
[47:35] our enemy. We have no authority over our
[47:37] enemy. Only what God's given us.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; We have AUTHORITY BECAUSE GOD GAVE IT TO
[47:42] US. That's our defense mechanism because
[47:45] he does it. We have no way to lead
[47:48] ourselves. We have no way to guide
[47:49] ourselves. We don't know which way to
[47:51] go. If you leave a person out, just let
[47:53] a kid be born and just let them cut them
[47:55] loose, they'll go out and there's no
[47:58] telling what that person and they'll
[48:00] probably end up just getting run over in
[48:01] the middle of the street because the kid
[48:02] won't know any better
[48:04] &gt;&gt; or end up in jail or end up dead or
[48:06] whatever it may be because they have no
[48:08] defense. They have to be led. They have
[48:10] to be taught. They have to be directed
[48:12] in the way they're supposed to go. Amen.
[48:15] And the sheep has no way to defend
[48:17] itself. So, it lays its life down. But
[48:19] thank God, those who know God, we've
[48:21] laid our lives down for him, not for the
[48:24] enemy. We lay our lives just like he
[48:26] laid his life down for us. We lay our
[48:29] lives down for him because of what he's
[48:31] done for us to give us to. So, he is my
[48:34] shepherd. So, if he's my shepherd, I
[48:36] don't have any want.
[48:38] I don't have a want because he's my
[48:40] shepherd. Praise the Lord. Now, if you
[48:43] depended on the government as your
[48:45] shepherd and you might be in need. You
[48:47] might be in want. You might be without.
[48:50] Praise the Lord. If you depend on the
[48:52] things of the world or the governments
[48:53] of the world or the dictators or
[48:55] whatever the world presence, you might
[48:57] be in want. But as long as he is your
[48:59] shepherd, you have need of nothing. You
[49:02] have no want of anything.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; He takes care of us because he's our
[49:06] shepherd. Praise the Lord. And he's put
[49:09] us in the place. He's put pastors in the
[49:11] place as shepherds so that the sheep
[49:14] there have nothing of one. That's why we
[49:17] always come together. That's why we
[49:19] always pray together. That's why we have
[49:22] texting groups and we call one another.
[49:24] Whatever it is we do to support each
[49:26] other. Amen. To have need. And there's a
[49:30] reason Sister Norma sent that request.
[49:31] She sent it to my wife, but Sonia sent
[49:33] it to me for her husband and for her
[49:35] nephew because she didn't think she'd be
[49:37] here in time for the prayer request.
[49:38] What is that? That's just a dependence.
[49:41] Amen. She's depending on that for us
[49:44] &gt;&gt; that this get brought out from here that
[49:46] we all know and can lift it up before
[49:48] God and touch the touch the heart of God
[49:51] for her uh husband and for her nephew.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; And I use that example because we but we
[49:56] all have that situation that we have
[49:58] that we go through because we're a
[49:59] group. We're we're a part of this
[50:01] together. If we have need, if we have
[50:04] want or something, we call one another.
[50:06] We text one another or we uh you call
[50:08] the pastor or text or something. We go
[50:10] to the Lord in prayer and we have no
[50:12] want because God blesses and takes care
[50:14] of us.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He lets every see that
[50:19] that's a lot of the confusion people
[50:21] have. People have confusion because they
[50:23] see all things that go that what we as
[50:25] humans consider a bad thing. But if we
[50:29] have we if we have trust and faith and
[50:32] we love God, we know that all things
[50:35] will work together for our good
[50:37] regardless of if it looks bad, feels
[50:40] bad, or so at the time. That's why a lot
[50:42] of people leave God because they, well,
[50:44] how could God do this? Well, why would
[50:46] God act that way? Why would God let this
[50:48] happen? Amen. When most of it's actually
[50:51] on free will. It happened because you a
[50:54] react an action has a reaction and your
[50:57] reaction. Amen. A lot of times that
[51:00] people put stuff at the doorstep of God
[51:02] and God didn't do it. You did that. Your
[51:05] actions and your decisions put you in
[51:08] that place. But anyway, uh we have no
[51:10] want because God takes care of us in in
[51:13] every way. And we know he does. Even as
[51:15] we've gone through some troublesome
[51:17] times, even if we've gone through some
[51:19] hardships, even if we've gone through
[51:21] some tribulations and things that's
[51:23] really put us on our knees, some
[51:25] sometimes you didn't was so dark you
[51:27] didn't think you'd ever see the light of
[51:29] day again. The dark the tunnel so long
[51:31] you didn't think there was ever an end
[51:33] to that tunnel. But God always brings
[51:35] you through.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He always brings a light. He
[51:39] always gets you through. And when you're
[51:41] in that when when the analogy, I guess
[51:45] the story is when you're on that
[51:47] beachfront, you only see one set of
[51:48] footprints. That's because he's carrying
[51:50] you. He didn't leave you. He's carrying
[51:53] you. I have no want cuz he's my
[51:56] shepherd. He maketh me to lie down in
[51:59] green pastures,
[52:01] good fertile land, good soft uh uh
[52:07] grass, grazing food. Amen.
[52:11] God doesn't God doesn't give a ribeye to
[52:14] a a a six-month-old.
[52:17] He gives us good green pastures, place
[52:20] to lay down, help. He make he he uh
[52:24] makes us alive down in that green in
[52:26] that green pasture, that pasture that's
[52:29] of tender grass. Amen. It just feels
[52:32] good. Well, I know we don't have much of
[52:34] that in Tucson, but I grew up in a place
[52:36] where it was you could get in a meadow
[52:39] like that and it was just peaceful and
[52:42] calm. And as a kid, I could just you
[52:44] could just have fun, enjoy it, and run
[52:46] around. And he maketh me to lie down in
[52:50] green pastures. He leadeth meth
[52:54] not driveth. He leadth me beside the
[52:58] still waters, the peaceful, calm, still.
[53:02] Amen. And that's just the opposite.
[53:04] Notice how that's just the opposite of
[53:06] what the devil tries to do to you in
[53:08] this world. The one thing that devil
[53:11] wants to do is create confusion, to
[53:14] create panic, to create uh a an an
[53:18] external struggle in yourself. Amen. to
[53:21] to try to to try to create some
[53:24] confusion in your mind to try to deceive
[53:26] you in your mind to try to give you a
[53:28] turmoil that you're always struggling
[53:30] and always fighting and always pushing
[53:32] and always everything goes on around the
[53:35] world around this country everything
[53:36] always you see this and fighting that
[53:38] and this and pushing that and this and
[53:39] killing that this and hurting that and
[53:41] it's JUST ALL A COMPLETE CHAOS AND
[53:43] THAT'S WHAT THE devil wants.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; That's what he wants to get you in. But
[53:48] we want to be able to be led by the
[53:50] still waters. Amen. Led by those still
[53:54] waters. Amen. Because those are the
[53:59] places that we find him. That still
[54:02] small voice as God speaks in the peace,
[54:06] the serenity
[54:08] that in the middle of a tornado, you're
[54:11] calm
[54:13] &gt;&gt; because you know who's in control
[54:15] &gt;&gt; because he's your shepherd. Amen. You
[54:18] come, you know everything's going to be
[54:20] fine. Regardless of what the world looks
[54:22] like, doesn't matter. You know where the
[54:24] world's going anyway. We know what's
[54:26] happening to this country. You know, we
[54:28] know what's going on in the world. Uh
[54:32] Lord willing uh the next few weeks when
[54:34] we get done with this, I want to speak
[54:36] on that a little bit. Amen. Leadeth me
[54:40] beside the still waters. Praise. That's
[54:42] just even when you read it, it sounds
[54:44] calming, doesn't it? Just gives your
[54:46] spirit like a rest. Just feel like you
[54:48] could.
[54:51] Oh, it feels good.
[54:53] Peace, calm,
[54:57] so nice. Amen. He restoreth my soul.
[55:02] Bringeth back. That word restore is to
[55:04] bring back. Amen. To press again. The
[55:06] only way. We were lost. We had no way
[55:08] back.
[55:10] No way for salvation. No hope. But God
[55:14] restores our soul. He brings it back.
[55:17] Amen. From where it was. Amen. Because
[55:20] it w it was in the mind of God. That
[55:22] part of God that God put in us. That
[55:26] seed comes in that soul and he brings it
[55:29] back to where it's supposed to be in the
[55:31] rightful place in its rightful condition
[55:34] before God. He restores it. Brings it
[55:37] back. He restores my soul. He leadth me.
[55:41] again leadth not driveth leth me in the
[55:45] paths of righteousness for his name's
[55:48] sake he leads me down the avenues of
[55:51] righteousness he leads us down the ways
[55:54] of truth that straight and narrow way
[55:58] that path of righteousness for his
[56:01] name's sake not according to somebody
[56:03] else's idea opinion or thought amen if
[56:06] you have no moral compass which we
[56:08] consider the scripture to be the
[56:10] scripture is our moral compass. The
[56:12] scripture used to be our country's moral
[56:14] compass. I don't think it is anymore.
[56:17] But the scripture is supposed to be our
[56:19] moral compass. That's why we have on our
[56:21] books do not kill, do not steal, do not
[56:23] lie. Amen. Other countries don't have
[56:26] those things, friend. They don't have
[56:28] that type of moral compass. In fact,
[56:30] there's religious books out there that
[56:32] actually encourage their people to lie
[56:35] if it furthers the betterment of
[56:37] whatever they're doing.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. for the goodness of this God or
[56:41] whoever they consider this leader to be.
[56:44] They they're encouraged to lie. If it
[56:47] actually furthers that, it always it
[56:49] come it comes back to that that thing
[56:52] that so many people and not just other
[56:55] religions. I have people I know that
[56:57] call themselves Christians that that
[56:59] they believe in every way that the ends
[57:02] justifies the means and it doesn't.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; It doesn't. And you say, "Well, lie
[57:08] about it. It'll bring a better result,
[57:10] but the end doesn't justify the means.
[57:14] The way you got there is what matters,
[57:16] right? Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; It'll bring you, even if you have to do
[57:20] a hard thing and tell the truth about
[57:22] something, it'll always bring it back
[57:24] around to where it's supposed to be in
[57:26] God.
[57:28] But there's other places they don't have
[57:30] that. This is our moral compass. This
[57:32] scripture is our moral compass. Amen.
[57:35] That's why we live by it. That's why it
[57:37] means so much to us. that we that we
[57:39] walk in those paths of righteousness,
[57:41] that truth of God's word. You if if
[57:45] everybody was left to their own
[57:47] morality, well, you well, you have what
[57:49] we've got today. People just living
[57:51] however they want, doing whatever they
[57:53] want, being they really don't care.
[57:55] Amen. Even to some people, just to kill
[57:58] somebody arbitrarily means nothing to
[57:59] them. I just I've heard people that were
[58:02] murderers that just come out and said,
[58:03] "I just killed him because I wanted them
[58:05] to die. I've never done it before. I
[58:06] just thought I'd try it.
[58:09] I see those people and I think and you
[58:11] know the first thing I said you've
[58:12] probably said it too this is something
[58:14] somebody with no conscience but they
[58:16] have to have a conscience because they
[58:18] got a soul
[58:19] &gt;&gt; a human has a soul and if a soul if they
[58:21] got a soul they got a conscience because
[58:22] conscience is a part of their soul but
[58:24] what the problem is the Bible says their
[58:26] conscience has been seared with a hot
[58:28] iron which means it's numb it's nullled
[58:32] and void it's been it's been seared like
[58:35] you when you burn yourself or something
[58:36] you it kind kind of numbs it. Amen.
[58:39] They've been seared with a hot iron
[58:41] where they they have a conscience, but
[58:43] it's dulled. It's numbed. It's not
[58:48] effective to uh to
[58:51] to getting to the moral compass of
[58:54] killing somebody is wrong. Murder is
[58:57] wrong. Stealing wrong. Lying is wrong.
[59:02] But people have that that compass. Amen.
[59:05] That conscience is seared. But God leads
[59:08] us in his paths of righteousness
[59:12] for his name's sake. Amen. Not by every
[59:15] individual's way. Amen. Like a lot of
[59:17] the people would want you to believe
[59:19] that. Well, you're your own god, so
[59:21] just, you know, whatever. You say
[59:22] whatever you want being, you know, I
[59:25] mean, they got to the place to say,
[59:26] well, you know, if you want to, you were
[59:29] born a woman, but if you want to be a
[59:30] man, just say you're a man. That makes
[59:32] you a man.
[59:34] You know what? Tomorrow you wake up and
[59:36] you feel a little uh a little more like
[59:38] a woman, then just say you're a woman.
[59:42] It's okay. Next day, if you want to be a
[59:44] man again, just go right ahead. Just
[59:46] say, "I'm a man." That makes you a man.
[59:48] All you got to do is say it and that
[59:49] makes it what you want it to be.
[59:54] Amen. That's the way of the world
[59:56] though. Yay, though I walk. Now, this is
[59:59] the thing that gets me so many times.
[1:00:02] And we went to me and Sonia went to
[1:00:04] Kay's funeral when the minister pastor
[1:00:08] uh woman got up there at that Methodist
[1:00:11] church. This the first thing she read is
[1:00:12] Psalms 23 at a funeral. And I'm thinking
[1:00:14] there's no there's no more scripture in
[1:00:17] the Bible that's a living scripture than
[1:00:19] this one. But people always tend to read
[1:00:22] Psalms 23 at a funeral. And I don't know
[1:00:25] why they do that because right here the
[1:00:27] B it inside the body of the scripture it
[1:00:31] says yay though I walk
[1:00:34] well you don't walk when you're dead you
[1:00:37] walk when you're alive.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; You don't walk through a shadow of death
[1:00:42] because you are dead.
[1:00:45] This is not a death scripture. This is a
[1:00:47] living scripture
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; because all the things we just talked
[1:00:51] about and read. Plus right here it says
[1:00:53] we walk through the valley of the shadow
[1:00:57] of death. Amen. And that's all it is.
[1:00:59] It's a shadow now. Amen. Used to didn't
[1:01:02] be. But when Christ came and gave his
[1:01:04] life and overcame death, hell, and the
[1:01:06] grave, it became nothing but a shadow.
[1:01:08] Amen. Only a likeness, if you will. A
[1:01:12] shadow of death. Though I walk through
[1:01:14] that shadow, I will fear no evil. And
[1:01:18] who and what's debt? We're gonna talk I
[1:01:20] I got I I know I've been studying on
[1:01:23] this a lot, so if it comes out, forgive
[1:01:25] me. I don't mean to intertwine it with
[1:01:27] this, but when you see a scripture that
[1:01:29] just kind of confirms what you've been
[1:01:30] the Lord's been talking to you about, uh
[1:01:33] it means a lot. But remember, there is
[1:01:35] one horse rider uh that actually has a
[1:01:39] name. You all know what that name is?
[1:01:42] Death.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; There's one horse rider that has a name.
[1:01:46] Praise the Lord. And notice we're in
[1:01:48] that time right now. His name is death.
[1:01:53] David, how many years before that? He
[1:01:57] reads he he he pins this. Though I walk
[1:02:00] to the valley of the shadow of death, I
[1:02:02] will fear death. I will fear no evil. I
[1:02:06] don't fear it. I don't fear the devil. I
[1:02:09] don't fear evil. I don't fear death.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; That was that was David before Christ
[1:02:15] even came and conquered death, hell, and
[1:02:17] the grave. What was he do? Oh, I believe
[1:02:19] that prophetic part of him was looking
[1:02:22] forward and seeing just as he talked
[1:02:24] about several places in the scripture
[1:02:26] about Christ and being on the cross and
[1:02:29] uh God uttering through him this
[1:02:32] scripture to bring it to where we got to
[1:02:34] Calvary and now where we can read it
[1:02:36] here. We can look back and we look back
[1:02:39] at Calvary, but then we can look back
[1:02:41] even further and see David talking about
[1:02:44] Christ on the cross and REALIZE THE
[1:02:47] PROPHETIC nature even of Psalms and
[1:02:49] Psalms him telling us telling us here
[1:02:52] and believing I will fear no evil.
[1:02:55] Praise the Lord. For thou art with me.
[1:02:59] Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
[1:03:03] You want some comfort? Now David said,
[1:03:05] "Thy rod and staff are a comfort to me."
[1:03:09] Now think about the two things that a
[1:03:11] shepherd carries with him that is for
[1:03:14] the sheep. He carries a rod which
[1:03:18] basically a rod a stick of I don't know
[1:03:21] how long. So long a stick had to be long
[1:03:23] enough because that stick that rod has
[1:03:26] to beat off any potential danger. If a
[1:03:30] wolf comes up to a sheep or a wolf gets
[1:03:32] close to it, that shepherd is to go up
[1:03:34] and beat that that wolf away from there
[1:03:36] or whatever enemy may come to try to
[1:03:38] take a sheep away. He has that rod to
[1:03:42] protect that sheep from the enemy. Well,
[1:03:44] it's no wonder that's a comfort to
[1:03:46] David.
[1:03:48] The a shepherd himself could speak uh
[1:03:52] firsthand of this. I've never been a
[1:03:53] shepherd, so I can only look at what the
[1:03:55] scripture says. HE DID IT HIMSELF. DAVID
[1:03:58] WAS A shepherd
[1:04:00] to tend sheep. So he knows what it meant
[1:04:03] for that rod that gave comfort because
[1:04:06] he knew himself even as a shepherd that
[1:04:09] he was the sheep of God's flock and
[1:04:12] being a shepher being being of God a
[1:04:14] sheep of God's flock that God would tend
[1:04:17] us the way that he tended his sheep with
[1:04:20] a rod AND A STAFF. ROD IS just a stick.
[1:04:23] IT WOULD BEAT OFF those potential
[1:04:26] dangers and animals that would try to
[1:04:28] try to come and take them away. It was
[1:04:30] also though for a discipline and a
[1:04:32] correction.
[1:04:34] Amen. So if a sheep started getting
[1:04:38] really rebellious, the shepherd would
[1:04:40] have to lay that stick on that that
[1:04:42] sheep to make sure he understood get him
[1:04:45] back in line. Amen. It reminds me of a a
[1:04:50] lesson you teach. See, kids kids aren't
[1:04:52] kids aren't to teach themselves. The
[1:04:55] parent is to teach the children. The
[1:04:57] children are supposed to be led and
[1:04:59] taught by the parent. Amen. And uh
[1:05:04] was it I can't remember one Christmas or
[1:05:06] Thanksgiving. One of the last times we
[1:05:08] were down visiting Zack Tabitha. Ruth
[1:05:11] came up to me and you know how little
[1:05:13] kids are. You know, did this and this
[1:05:15] and jabbering jabbering jabing about all
[1:05:17] everything else in the world, anything
[1:05:19] and everything. She just come off the
[1:05:21] cuff of this that and the other and Emma
[1:05:23] or Joel just kind of come up and say
[1:05:24] she's talking about this. Okay. I have
[1:05:27] no idea. They were over here and this
[1:05:29] happened. They saw that and it was a dog
[1:05:31] or something. And she's going on telling
[1:05:32] me and she starts at the end of the
[1:05:34] story telling me about the story and
[1:05:37] okay. So she comes up and said uh I
[1:05:40] burnt my finger. Uh I said oh you did?
[1:05:44] She said yeah. She showed it to me and
[1:05:46] she said, "Mommy told me not to parent
[1:05:49] supposed to tell, you know, iron is hot,
[1:05:51] honey. You don't touch an iron. When I'm
[1:05:54] ironing clothes, you don't touch the
[1:05:56] iron. It's hot. It'll hurt you." But as
[1:05:59] the little children do sometimes, she
[1:06:00] goes up and she touches the iron and it
[1:06:03] burned her and it hurt her. She started
[1:06:04] crying. She come to me uh several days
[1:06:07] later when we were there. It burned my
[1:06:09] finger. I said, "Oh." I said, "Okay." I
[1:06:11] said, "Phil," she said, "Yeah, it's
[1:06:13] better now." And I said, "I bet you
[1:06:14] won't ever do that again, will you?" She
[1:06:16] said, "No."
[1:06:18] See, cuz even though she didn't listen
[1:06:20] to mama, she got a greater lesson by
[1:06:22] sticking her finger on that iron. She
[1:06:24] won't do that anymore. Well, sometimes
[1:06:26] God's got to take that rod and he's got
[1:06:28] to lay it on the on on the sheep to get
[1:06:30] it back in line and say, "Okay, you
[1:06:32] won't listen. Well, then I' I've got to
[1:06:35] teach you a greater lesson to keep you
[1:06:37] in line." Because if you start wandering
[1:06:39] out here, you'll get lost. Next thing
[1:06:41] you know, you'll you'll be dead. That's
[1:06:43] right. A
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; a predator will get you and kill you,
[1:06:45] eat you. Amen. We even know that a
[1:06:49] shepherd will if you get a real
[1:06:50] rebellious sheep, a shepherd will go out
[1:06:52] and break his leg if he has to go chase
[1:06:54] him two or three times, he'll break that
[1:06:58] sheep's leg, that lamb's leg to keep him
[1:07:01] in. And then he'll put him on his
[1:07:02] shoulder and he'll nurse him back to
[1:07:04] health and he'll get him back. And then
[1:07:06] that then then the relation comes up.
[1:07:08] Amen. When I when I get too far out, I
[1:07:12] get broke leg. If I get if I stray too
[1:07:16] far out, my leg broke.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do that again. Amen.
[1:07:21] Burnt finger. Not going to do that
[1:07:23] again, are you? Nope. Amen. Just that
[1:07:27] simple lesson. You don't want them to
[1:07:29] get burnt. But sometimes
[1:07:31] children, sometimes adults just a little
[1:07:34] too hard-headed
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; and have to learn the hard way. And God
[1:07:38] has to take that rod out, bring
[1:07:40] discipline, correction. Amen. And the
[1:07:43] shepherd also use the rod to count the
[1:07:45] sheep. You know, a shepherd constantly
[1:07:47] counts his sheep. Amen. To make sure
[1:07:50] they're all there. Now, that's a natural
[1:07:51] sheep. God doesn't have to do that
[1:07:52] because he's infinite. But a regular
[1:07:55] sheep had to take the rod and count the
[1:07:57] sheep. And he always count the sheep to
[1:07:59] make sure because um most of sheep, most
[1:08:04] I've ever seen, they all look alike. I
[1:08:06] mean, you can't look and say, "Hey, Bob.
[1:08:08] Hey, Fred. Hey, Sally. Hey, Sue." You
[1:08:11] know, they just all the sheep look all
[1:08:13] alike. They don't have names or they
[1:08:16] don't have initials on them or collars.
[1:08:18] They're just sheep. Sheep. You got to
[1:08:19] make sure if I had 14, I got 14. Now I
[1:08:22] got 14. And that and I still got 14. I
[1:08:25] still got 14. They count the sheep. Make
[1:08:27] sure that none has gone astray. Make
[1:08:30] sure that none has wandered off. Make
[1:08:31] sure that you've got what you're
[1:08:33] supposed to have. And that what a
[1:08:35] comfort that is. Amen. To know that even
[1:08:38] if we have to be corrected back into
[1:08:40] where we're supposed to be back on the
[1:08:42] path of righteousness, God is there to
[1:08:44] take care of us.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Even if he has to break our leg, he is
[1:08:49] there to nurse us back to health.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; He is there to bring us back into the
[1:08:52] place that we are supposed to be. Amen.
[1:08:56] Staff. The staff is the crooked thing
[1:08:59] that you've seen. I'm sure looks kind of
[1:09:00] like a candy cane that is crooked like
[1:09:03] that. Uh thought about drawing a
[1:09:06] picture, but I figured you all knew what
[1:09:07] that was. The crooked part is to try to
[1:09:10] help guide the sheep. Now, if if the
[1:09:12] sheep gets the the rod for correction if
[1:09:15] the sheep gets way out of line, but they
[1:09:17] had the staff there to kind of if
[1:09:19] they're just kind of moving out a little
[1:09:21] bit, uh maybe not rebelliously, but just
[1:09:24] kind of getting off the beaten path a
[1:09:26] little bit. Amen. which we tend to do.
[1:09:29] Get off the beaten path. He takes that
[1:09:32] staff and just takes that crook there
[1:09:33] and just nudges them back over in line.
[1:09:36] Amen. You're getting out. Just get get
[1:09:38] back in line. Amen. What to brother
[1:09:40] Brandon when he woke up from that vision
[1:09:42] he was screaming get back in line. Amen.
[1:09:45] That staff is to gently take them. And
[1:09:48] also that staff was used because of the
[1:09:50] crook on the end that he could reach out
[1:09:51] and grab a sheep and pull him up to
[1:09:53] himself and hold him. It was to pick him
[1:09:55] up, to be able to move him. You can move
[1:09:57] him or bring him back to him that by
[1:09:59] that crooked end, go right under his
[1:10:01] belly and pull him up and and guide him.
[1:10:03] So you see how that in itself could be
[1:10:06] such a comfort, such a comfort to us.
[1:10:10] You think about a stick and a staff and
[1:10:12] you think, how could that be a comfort?
[1:10:13] But David realized the significance of
[1:10:16] those things and how much that brings us
[1:10:18] comfort to realize even if I get a
[1:10:20] little off, even if I go a littlestray,
[1:10:22] even if God is there to watch over me,
[1:10:26] if an enemy comes, if a if the devil
[1:10:28] comes, if something comes to try to take
[1:10:30] us and try to kill us, God is there to
[1:10:33] beat him off. God will take care of him.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he'll take care of him
[1:10:38] through us a lot of times. Amen. Get
[1:10:40] thee behind me, Satan.
[1:10:43] Praise the Lord. But God always is the
[1:10:46] ultimate authority. He takes care of us
[1:10:47] because he is the shepherd of the
[1:10:49] sheepfold. The rod and staff, they
[1:10:52] comfort us. Praise the Lord. You won't
[1:10:54] comfort. Just remember those things.
[1:10:57] Thou preparest a table before me in the
[1:11:00] presence of my enemies. Now, that's one
[1:11:02] of my favorite things, especially when
[1:11:03] you start thinking about people that
[1:11:05] have come against you. Amen. And God
[1:11:08] continuously in the midst of all that,
[1:11:10] God continuously blesses you. God
[1:11:13] continuously proves that he's with you.
[1:11:15] God continuously shows not to just them
[1:11:18] but you. Amen. That you are his and that
[1:11:21] he is with you and that he is taking
[1:11:23] care of and watching over you. Amen. He
[1:11:26] does and proves it. But he prepares this
[1:11:28] this food this this uh comfort in the
[1:11:32] presence of our enemies. So regardless
[1:11:35] of what somebody might think of you,
[1:11:37] regardless of somebody might think
[1:11:39] you're a a rascal renegade or not a
[1:11:41] Christian or child of God, GOD
[1:11:43] CONTINUOUSLY PROVES THAT YOU ARE.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So who is who's going to say what
[1:11:50] now?
[1:11:51] When God speaks, who is going to come
[1:11:54] against that?
[1:11:56] God takes care of it. He prepares that
[1:11:59] table before me in the presence of my
[1:12:02] need. Thou anointest my head with oil.
[1:12:05] Amen. Remember the Holy Spirit we know
[1:12:07] represents the Holy Spirit. My uh the
[1:12:09] oil represents the Holy Spirit. My cup
[1:12:12] runth over. I am come to give you life
[1:12:16] and to give you life
[1:12:18] more abundantly,
[1:12:21] overwhelming,
[1:12:23] overflooding.
[1:12:25] How many of you in here believe that
[1:12:26] you've gotten blessed by God way more
[1:12:28] than what you ever deserved?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] Well, you didn't have to raise your
[1:12:33] hand, but thank you for that. It was
[1:12:34] kind of just a rhetorical question, but
[1:12:36] anyway, uh truth is we all should. I
[1:12:40] believe we all do.
[1:12:43] It's humbling every day to think about
[1:12:46] when I think of myself of how God has
[1:12:49] blessed me and how unworthy that I that
[1:12:52] I am, have been and am of the grace and
[1:12:56] the mercies of God, the goodness of God
[1:12:58] that God has given me. where I could
[1:13:01] have been, where I I could have done,
[1:13:05] where I would be now if not been for the
[1:13:08] grace of God.
[1:13:10] My cup runth over continuously,
[1:13:14] continually run over. Surely goodness
[1:13:17] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[1:13:21] of my life, and I will dwell in the
[1:13:24] house of the Lord forever. Praise the
[1:13:27] Lord Jesus. Amen. I will dwell in the
[1:13:30] house of the Lord forever.
[1:13:34] That means now and after now. Shepherd
[1:13:37] of the sheepfold 1956.
[1:13:40] Brother Mar says, "And that's the way
[1:13:42] the human race is.
[1:13:44] We are absolutely totally helpless
[1:13:47] without the shepherd of the fold. We
[1:13:50] can't find our way back. We tried to
[1:13:53] educate our way back. We've tried to
[1:13:56] reform our way back, but we'll never be
[1:13:58] able.
[1:14:00] Education will never do it. Reformation
[1:14:03] will never do it. We're not reformers.
[1:14:06] Re says we're not reformers. THE POLICE
[1:14:08] OUT HERE, THEY are reformers. WE'RE
[1:14:11] PREACHERS OF THE GOSPEL.
[1:14:13] NOT TO try to put people on a penalty,
[1:14:16] crawl on your knees, and so forth, but
[1:14:18] to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[1:14:21] deliverance to the people.
[1:14:24] Praise the Lord. Position of a shepherd.
[1:14:28] That's why the shepherds are that is
[1:14:30] that is what the shepherds are supposed
[1:14:33] to do to feed the sheep. Now, if they're
[1:14:36] God's sheep, what kind of fe uh what
[1:14:38] kind of feed do you feed them? Sheep
[1:14:41] food. They get sheep get sheep food. Not
[1:14:45] goat. Not goat food. Amen. But sheep
[1:14:48] food. The the the the shepherd is
[1:14:51] supposed to feed the sheep. Yes. But
[1:14:53] they're supposed to feed them sheep
[1:14:54] food. Where's the sheep food? The sheep
[1:14:57] food's right here. Amen. Stored up my
[1:15:00] sister and she talked about that was
[1:15:02] stored up. Amen. In the storehouse, we
[1:15:05] have the sheep food right here. The
[1:15:07] sheep food come directly from the
[1:15:09] shepherd, from the hand of the shepherd.
[1:15:12] Praise the Lord. You know, he uh you
[1:15:15] know, he said uh to Peter, "Love me,
[1:15:17] Peter, more than these." Yes, feed my
[1:15:19] sheep. Now, he never said, "Drive my
[1:15:22] sheep." He never said, "Kick my sheep."
[1:15:26] Which unfortunately, I have to admit
[1:15:28] I've seen pastors do.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; You can't drive sheep. You never kick
[1:15:33] them. He said, "Feed my sheep.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the sheep needs is some
[1:15:38] sheep food." Don't you think so? He
[1:15:41] says, "And you know the best sheep food
[1:15:44] I know of for your sick sheep and and
[1:15:48] all kinds of sheep." Here it is. He
[1:15:50] holds his Bible. I'm assuming he's
[1:15:52] holding his Bible. Here it is. That's
[1:15:54] right. In this great bread, a big bread
[1:15:57] basket of God. Man shall not live by
[1:15:59] bread alone, but by every word that
[1:16:01] proceedth out of the mouth of God.
[1:16:03] That's what the Holy Spirit lives on
[1:16:05] that's in you. Lives on the word of God.
[1:16:07] That's the connection of the shepherd to
[1:16:10] the sheep. Amen. Sheep food.
[1:16:14] The sheep leads. The shepherd leads the
[1:16:16] sheep. Not drives, not kicks, not beats,
[1:16:20] but leads. Amen. And gives feeds. Sheep
[1:16:24] food. Food in due spiritual food in due
[1:16:27] season. Amen. Sheep food. That's what
[1:16:30] the shepherd gets for the sheep is sheep
[1:16:33] food. Praise the Lord. Because the the
[1:16:36] shepherd is the first line of defense
[1:16:38] between the sheep and the enemy. Amen.
[1:16:41] Like I said, with the rod, the the the
[1:16:44] shepherd is the one to defend the sheep
[1:16:46] against the enemy.
[1:16:49] That's that's where a lot of that, as we
[1:16:53] said the other day, comes that comes
[1:16:54] down on the pastor for the people in his
[1:16:56] congregation.
[1:16:58] the responsibility that's been given not
[1:17:01] only just for the spiritual welfare but
[1:17:03] the protection from the enemy to keep
[1:17:06] the enemy at bay to keep the enemy off
[1:17:08] to keep the sheep on the right path to
[1:17:10] keep them on the path of righteousness
[1:17:13] for his name's sake the shepherd's
[1:17:15] responsibility the first line of defense
[1:17:18] amen when a shepherd when a sheep gets
[1:17:20] to the place that it starts getting uh
[1:17:24] astray or enemy comes after it the
[1:17:26] shepherd is to is to be there to defend
[1:17:29] that sheep from that enemy. Amen. The
[1:17:32] first line of defense is between those
[1:17:34] two. Now, let's go uh first St. John. I
[1:17:38] want to read the scripture that we just
[1:17:40] that he just spoke of
[1:17:45] just be a little bit longer. St. John
[1:17:47] chapter 21.
[1:17:50] I got a couple more really I think
[1:17:52] really good quotes too I'd like to read.
[1:17:56] St. John 21 place where we find this
[1:17:59] reading that brother Brandham just
[1:18:00] referred to
[1:18:03] starting with verse 15 St. John 21:15.
[1:18:06] And I had this uh through probably a
[1:18:10] greater explanation than I'll do today
[1:18:12] in my book uh about this scripture
[1:18:16] because there's more to this scripture
[1:18:17] than what we just read as far as the
[1:18:19] English language is concerned which I
[1:18:22] will go over a little bit uh but not in
[1:18:24] detail this evening. So uh St. John
[1:18:28] 21:15. So when they had dined, Jesus
[1:18:32] said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
[1:18:34] Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?
[1:18:38] And he said unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou
[1:18:40] knowest that I love thee." He said unto
[1:18:43] him, "Feed my lambs." Amen. A lamb is is
[1:18:46] a younger sheep.
[1:18:49] He saith unto him again the second
[1:18:51] time,"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
[1:18:54] me?" He said unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou
[1:18:58] knowest that I love thee." He saith unto
[1:19:01] him, "Feed my sheep, older sheep."
[1:19:08] Older, more experienced, more grown up,
[1:19:10] more grown in the Lord, if you will. He
[1:19:12] said unto him the third time, "Simon,
[1:19:15] son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Peter was
[1:19:18] grieved because he said unto him the
[1:19:20] third time, "Lovest thou me?" And he
[1:19:22] said unto him,"Lord, thou knowest all
[1:19:25] things. Thou knowest that I love thee."
[1:19:28] Jesus said unto him, "Feed my sheep."
[1:19:31] Amen. Now, there's a difference in the
[1:19:34] love that Jesus is talking about here
[1:19:37] because it came to my attention uh more
[1:19:41] more so when I guess the Lord was
[1:19:42] directing me to write that book. It came
[1:19:44] to me that uh that it was fairly fairly
[1:19:48] peculiar. In fact, I've never found any
[1:19:50] other place in the scripture where Jesus
[1:19:52] does this. Three times inconsecutive uh
[1:19:56] consecutively to the same person the
[1:19:58] same question. But it really isn't the
[1:20:01] same question. Jesus said first he said,
[1:20:04] "Love thou me more than these." Then he
[1:20:08] says, "Lovest thou me, not more than
[1:20:11] these, but do you love me?" And notice,
[1:20:13] you probably don't know because it
[1:20:15] doesn't say because our word love in the
[1:20:16] English language is interchangeable to
[1:20:19] uh the different loves that we know of.
[1:20:21] It's in the Greek language. Uh filio
[1:20:24] love, agapo love, and agapeo love. See?
[1:20:27] And uh so there's there's God's love in
[1:20:30] action. There's God's love that's just
[1:20:32] love because he is love. And there's a
[1:20:34] filio love which is human love. And when
[1:20:37] God asks the question,
[1:20:40] God is of course talking about the
[1:20:42] agapeo love, God's love. Amen. God's
[1:20:46] love. Do you love me more than these?
[1:20:48] And he said, I you know that I love
[1:20:51] thee. And his response is a filio love.
[1:20:53] If you go look, you can see. So the
[1:20:55] loves are different. But I want to get
[1:20:57] to the feed the feed my sheep part. Uh
[1:21:01] if you want further on the love part,
[1:21:03] just read my book. uh the whole I go
[1:21:06] through it quite extensively in there
[1:21:07] but the feed part I want to talk about
[1:21:10] feed my lambs. Now the feed my lambs.
[1:21:14] Now we notice that the lambs and the
[1:21:16] sheep are a a differentiation of uh more
[1:21:21] mature or a less mature. But a shepherd
[1:21:25] is supposed to be able to be in
[1:21:26] condition to take care of any sheep, if
[1:21:30] you will, that is put in their care,
[1:21:32] whether they're younger sheep, whether
[1:21:34] they don't have as much experience, they
[1:21:36] haven't grown as the Lord, maybe uh
[1:21:38] grown in the Lord maybe as some of the
[1:21:40] others in the congregation or something.
[1:21:42] They're to be able to take care of every
[1:21:45] level of sheep that's there. Feed. Now,
[1:21:47] the feed is a different is actually two
[1:21:50] different feeds in here. uh the the the
[1:21:53] first feed that's actually St. John
[1:21:55] 15:17
[1:21:56] is a feed. Now listen to this. The word
[1:22:00] feed, it's the same uh uh it uses the
[1:22:04] same feed d for all of these. But the
[1:22:07] verse when he says it verse 15 and 17,
[1:22:10] Jesus is referring to this portraying
[1:22:13] the duty of a Christian's teacher to
[1:22:17] promote in every way the spiritual
[1:22:20] welfare of the members of the church.
[1:22:23] Now, how does that sound? Just exactly
[1:22:25] like what we read earlier in in Greek
[1:22:28] 41:66 when it comes talking about
[1:22:31] pastors and shepherds.
[1:22:34] Amen. Again, portraying the duty of a
[1:22:37] Christian teacher to promote in every
[1:22:40] way the spiritual welfare of the members
[1:22:42] of that church.
[1:22:45] Amen. the that that position in the
[1:22:48] spiritual welfare of the congregants of
[1:22:51] the sheep of those that are under the
[1:22:53] care of that pastor that is his position
[1:22:57] to be able to promote in every way the
[1:23:00] spirit your your spiritual welfare amend
[1:23:04] for all of us our spiritual welfare
[1:23:07] that's what is now the the verse 16 same
[1:23:11] word feed d which is a derivative which
[1:23:16] is uh the the the root word of this is
[1:23:19] the same word as pastors that we read
[1:23:23] the Greek word it's the same word I
[1:23:24] don't want to go into all that but it's
[1:23:26] the same it's a derivative the root word
[1:23:28] is the same word that is used for
[1:23:31] pastors shepherds that we just read and
[1:23:34] this the 16th verse feed is this
[1:23:39] to feed to tend a flock to keep sheep
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] to feed. Now, notice how it it it varies
[1:23:50] seemingly
[1:23:51] uh marginally in what we have in our
[1:23:55] language, but it really is a difference,
[1:23:58] but it encompasses the entirety of what
[1:24:01] a shepherd is supposed to do for the
[1:24:03] sheep. Listen, we'll continue on. to
[1:24:06] feed, to tend a flock, keep the sheep,
[1:24:10] to supply the re the requisites for the
[1:24:15] soul's needs, the requisites, the
[1:24:18] necessities
[1:24:20] of the soul's needs.
[1:24:23] Now look what he does. It take it it
[1:24:25] talks about now the tasks. Now this is
[1:24:29] not in the other feet. Do you notice how
[1:24:32] Jesus when he says the word feed, he
[1:24:35] isn't simply saying just preach to them?
[1:24:39] That's not what he's saying. You think
[1:24:41] feed? Okay, I'll come to church and I'll
[1:24:43] I'll preach to you and that's it. We'll
[1:24:45] go home and that's the end of it. No,
[1:24:48] doesn't work that way. What Jesus was
[1:24:51] doing was encompassing every aspect of
[1:24:54] what a of what a real shepherd pastor's
[1:24:57] duty responsibility is to his flock. Now
[1:25:00] look at this. It even goes on in the
[1:25:03] Greek in the verse 16 feed to saying to
[1:25:08] watch for enemies trying to attack the
[1:25:11] sheep.
[1:25:12] Amen. Now feed the sheep. Yes. But it
[1:25:15] but to watch for enemies trying to
[1:25:17] attack the sheep.
[1:25:20] You think, well that's encompassed in
[1:25:21] the word that Jesus used, feed. Yes,
[1:25:25] that's part of it. To defend the sheep
[1:25:28] from attackers.
[1:25:30] to heal the wounded and sick sheep.
[1:25:34] That's part of feat. Yes.
[1:25:37] Take care of responsibility of to find
[1:25:40] and save lost or trapped sheep
[1:25:44] to love them sharing their lives and so
[1:25:49] earning their trust.
[1:25:52] I noticed
[1:25:54] when you have confidence in somebody
[1:25:57] that person can help you.
[1:25:59] If you don't have confidence in that
[1:26:02] person, the advice you're giving you or
[1:26:03] what they're telling you or whatever, if
[1:26:05] you don't have confidence in that
[1:26:06] person, they can't help you. No matter
[1:26:09] how much truth they bring, no matter how
[1:26:10] much good they can give, if you don't
[1:26:12] have confidence in that person, first of
[1:26:14] all, you're probably not going to do
[1:26:15] what they're recommending or what
[1:26:17] they're teaching or what they're
[1:26:18] telling, but you're not going to you're
[1:26:21] you're not going to uh become a part of
[1:26:24] what they're offering because you have
[1:26:26] no confidence in that person.
[1:26:28] I mean that's why it's so important when
[1:26:30] brother Brandham talked in the scripture
[1:26:32] talks about killing someone's influence
[1:26:35] when when you talk about killing murder
[1:26:38] killing somebody destroying somebody
[1:26:41] that's why he couples that the scripture
[1:26:43] does brother Brown as much as actual
[1:26:46] physical death when you destroy
[1:26:49] somebody's character the point of that
[1:26:52] IS TO TRY TO cause other people to turn
[1:26:56] against that individual So they no
[1:26:58] longer have confidence in that
[1:27:00] individual
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; as a person.
[1:27:04] And that's the killing of an influence.
[1:27:06] That's death according to the scripture.
[1:27:09] You go into John, it tells you. You say,
[1:27:13] "I never murdered anybody." Yeah, but
[1:27:14] you killed their influence. You killed
[1:27:17] their reputation. You killed their uh uh
[1:27:20] their standing in front of the people.
[1:27:23] And if the people have no confidence in
[1:27:25] them,
[1:27:27] it's it's like
[1:27:29] it's like I used to say uh in Florida,
[1:27:32] we had a vote every year in Florida. Not
[1:27:35] a vote of another pastor, but a vote of
[1:27:38] confidence to me.
[1:27:40] Uh do you still have confidence in your
[1:27:42] pastor? Amen. That was basically what it
[1:27:44] was. It wasn't to switch out another
[1:27:46] pastor because there was nobody else
[1:27:48] running, but it was like a confidence
[1:27:51] vote. Is there confidence? cuz I I you
[1:27:54] know that people are saying well if
[1:27:56] there's more than 50%. I I I'm like look
[1:27:59] you know we have a small congregation
[1:28:01] there's one or two
[1:28:04] you know I I don't know what do you do
[1:28:06] at that point.
[1:28:09] I if I can't be any more help to a group
[1:28:12] of people I might as well hit the road
[1:28:15] so you can find somebody you can have
[1:28:17] confidence in. So God will lead you
[1:28:20] somebody in here that you can have
[1:28:21] confidence in. Because if I'm up here
[1:28:24] and half of you have no confidence in
[1:28:26] me, what are we doing?
[1:28:29] You can't be helped. I can't help you
[1:28:32] because you have no confidence. You have
[1:28:34] no confidence. It's like people have no
[1:28:36] confidence in God. God can't help that
[1:28:38] person. People say, "I pray and pray and
[1:28:40] pray." Yeah, but who are you praying to?
[1:28:42] What are you praying about? Are you
[1:28:43] praying for God to change his mind or
[1:28:45] are you praying that God will change
[1:28:47] your mind? What do you pray? Do you have
[1:28:50] confidence in the one you're talking to?
[1:28:52] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU ASK HE'S
[1:28:53] GOING TO ask that he's going to answer?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; If you don't have confidence, it's not
[1:28:57] going to help you. You got to have
[1:28:59] confidence. You got to have faith. You
[1:29:01] got to have belief that if that that God
[1:29:04] will do what he said he would do. Amen.
[1:29:07] Earning their trust. That's a big part
[1:29:08] of it. Making sure that they if they
[1:29:11] have confidence, then they then they can
[1:29:13] help you.
[1:29:15] That's the whole point. Amen. And I
[1:29:17] thought it was very essential,
[1:29:19] especially when, like I said, I was
[1:29:21] pastoring in Florida. It was a very
[1:29:23] important part of it.
[1:29:25] But all of these things, all of these
[1:29:29] attributes, all of these uh actions are
[1:29:31] a part of God's duty to us, the pastor's
[1:29:35] shepherd's responsibility to his flock.
[1:29:38] Amen. Not just to get up and preach.
[1:29:41] Understand? Now, I want to read these uh
[1:29:45] uh uh while I did that. Let's go over to
[1:29:48] Acts.
[1:29:49] Acts chapter 20. It's the last scripture
[1:29:51] I want to read. Acts 20.
[1:29:59] Acts 20:28,
[1:30:06] couple of verses. Acts 20:28.
[1:30:11] Uh, take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:30:14] and to all the flock over the which the
[1:30:16] Holy Ghost had made you overseers to
[1:30:18] feed the church of God which he had
[1:30:20] purchased with his own blood. Again,
[1:30:22] bringing that back to the reality of the
[1:30:25] importance of this and the and the
[1:30:28] humble humbling that it does to any real
[1:30:31] pastor. It would be very humbling
[1:30:34] to feed the church of God which he
[1:30:36] purchased with his own blood.
[1:30:39] For I know this, that after my departing
[1:30:42] shall grievous wolves enter in among
[1:30:44] you, not sparing the flock. Also of your
[1:30:47] own selves shall men arise.
[1:30:50] Also among yourselves,
[1:30:54] among your own selves shall men arise
[1:30:57] speaking perverse things to draw them
[1:31:00] away disciples after them,
[1:31:04] not after God. A true shepherd doesn't
[1:31:07] guide you to anyone
[1:31:09] but to the sheepfold
[1:31:12] to the great shepherd.
[1:31:14] He never tries to draw you to himself or
[1:31:17] anything he is says done.
[1:31:20] Always the shepherd will lead you to the
[1:31:22] great sheepfold to the shepherd the the
[1:31:25] great shepherd of the sheep
[1:31:27] to draw disciples after them. Therefore,
[1:31:31] watch and remember that by the space of
[1:31:33] the three years, I cease not to warn
[1:31:35] everyone night and day with tears.
[1:31:38] That's how great of an issue that that
[1:31:40] uh Paul thought it was. Amen. To make
[1:31:44] sure that everybody under his voice knew
[1:31:48] and felt the and of course the ones that
[1:31:50] he was responsible for and the shepherds
[1:31:52] that were there did this and felt the
[1:31:54] same way. Now, let me read these couple
[1:31:55] of quotes. I'll close here.
[1:31:58] the Godhead explained. Now, this is very
[1:32:00] unusual. It's the only place I've ever
[1:32:02] found brother Brandham explaining this
[1:32:03] like this, but listen. And and usually
[1:32:06] anything that's unusual springs up is
[1:32:09] called into question.
[1:32:11] It's And I think it's no more than
[1:32:14] right. Listen to how Brother Brown puts
[1:32:15] this. It's no more than right. It should
[1:32:19] be called into question what? Anything
[1:32:21] that seems unusual that springs up, he
[1:32:23] says it should be brought into question.
[1:32:26] And I think that pastors
[1:32:29] sometime are suspicious of things that
[1:32:31] they hear and I think they have a right
[1:32:34] to be
[1:32:36] because if I understand the translation
[1:32:38] of the word pastor means a shepherd.
[1:32:41] Therefore, he is a feeder or a herder of
[1:32:45] a group of men and women of which the
[1:32:46] Holy Spirit has made him the overseer.
[1:32:51] And he has a right.
[1:32:54] The pastor has a right to know what kind
[1:32:58] of food his sheep is eating
[1:33:01] and where it is coming from. That's why
[1:33:05] he talked about a a shepherd, a pastor
[1:33:08] would be a little more suspicious of
[1:33:10] things you listen. Amen. I've talked
[1:33:13] about I told it to brother Green and
[1:33:16] about the ringing of the bell. Brother
[1:33:18] said it rings a bell. Something in me
[1:33:21] goes off. It's that's the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:22] You know, Brother Green taught that.
[1:33:24] Don't just say it's, you know, a little
[1:33:26] something told you or whatever. That's
[1:33:27] God. That's the Holy Spirit. Say what it
[1:33:30] is. Amen. When that goes off in me, it's
[1:33:32] I believe that's God in me telling me
[1:33:35] that something's not right about what
[1:33:36] that brother just said or what he just
[1:33:38] preached. He said that pastor has a
[1:33:40] right to believe that, to be suspicious
[1:33:44] of those things. He has a right to know
[1:33:46] what kind of food his sheep is getting
[1:33:48] and where it's coming from.
[1:33:50] I think he has a right to that. And if a
[1:33:54] pastor sometimes people would seem to be
[1:33:56] just a little bit suspicious, that
[1:33:58] doesn't never should not bother anyone.
[1:34:00] It should only bring a respect to the
[1:34:04] man's heart for the man of them that
[1:34:06] he's standing uh that's standing that
[1:34:09] would question it. And after all, if
[1:34:12] you're not sure that you're lined up
[1:34:14] right, how can you ever walk by faith?
[1:34:18] That's a part of the pastor's
[1:34:20] responsibility.
[1:34:22] Amen. To make sure that that we're
[1:34:25] walking straight. We're mo we're on that
[1:34:27] straight and narrow. Amen. That we
[1:34:30] actually have faith in God. When we talk
[1:34:33] to God and we bring petitions to the
[1:34:35] Lord, we know he hears us. We know he's
[1:34:38] listening. We know he answers. We have
[1:34:41] faith to believe. Periods. And it might
[1:34:43] not always work out the way I have it
[1:34:45] worked or figured in my mind that it's
[1:34:48] going to work, but it'll work together
[1:34:50] for our good. I know that. Praise the
[1:34:53] Lord. Because we're not to pray a rosary
[1:34:55] or some kind of something. We're not
[1:34:57] there to change God's mind on anything.
[1:35:00] We're asking, Lord, change me to fit
[1:35:03] your will. Praise the Lord. That's
[1:35:06] faith. Revelation, book of symbols. He
[1:35:09] said, "If a boy was at the door, knock
[1:35:12] at the door there and told the usher, I
[1:35:15] have a telegram here." Here's another
[1:35:18] important one. So listen close. I have a
[1:35:20] telegram here for Mrs. So and so and Mr.
[1:35:23] So and so he would be a messenger or an
[1:35:27] earthly angel.
[1:35:29] your pastor when he stands here on the
[1:35:32] platform ministering the word of God. He
[1:35:35] is God's angel to that church,
[1:35:39] messenger to that church.
[1:35:42] Therefore, a pastor should never
[1:35:45] never leave that word. Praise God. I
[1:35:50] don't know how to emphasize that any
[1:35:51] stronger, but a pastor should never
[1:35:54] leave that word. I said, any minister
[1:35:56] should never leave the word. Pastor
[1:35:58] should never leave that word, but stay
[1:36:00] right straight on that word because he's
[1:36:02] feeding in the shepherd's place because
[1:36:05] the word pastor here means shepherd.
[1:36:08] Amen. And said, look it up. You'll find
[1:36:09] it's right. A pastor is a shepherd. The
[1:36:12] Holy Spirit has made him the overseer of
[1:36:14] a certain flock to feed them with what?
[1:36:18] With God's word.
[1:36:22] The shepherd's position, pastor's
[1:36:24] position to feed.
[1:36:28] to protect, to take care of, to watch
[1:36:31] over, to correct, to bring back, to to
[1:36:35] fend off the enemy. The first line of
[1:36:37] defense is to keep the enemy at bay.
[1:36:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. You can't always
[1:36:42] do that physically, but I certainly can
[1:36:45] when I come before the Lord on your
[1:36:46] behalf.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And stand in the gap on your on
[1:36:50] your behalf. Praise the Lord. That's the
[1:36:53] first line of defense to keep you from
[1:36:55] the enemy, to keep the to keep the enemy
[1:36:58] at bay, to keep the Lord so strong in
[1:37:00] your life, in your heart, that that it
[1:37:03] it it overcomes anything and everything
[1:37:05] that the devil tries to throw at you.
[1:37:08] Praise the Lord. And to hopefully by
[1:37:10] God's grace have enough confidence to
[1:37:12] believe that what I'm teaching, what I
[1:37:14] preach is the word of God. It's the
[1:37:16] truth. It's the word. You go and you
[1:37:19] look and you read for yourself and find
[1:37:21] that's what he said.
[1:37:22] That's what the word says. That's what
[1:37:24] the prophet said. I believe that to be
[1:37:26] the truth.
[1:37:29] Sometimes it's not easy. A lot of times
[1:37:31] it's very burdensome.
[1:37:33] But God takes care of the whole the
[1:37:38] whole thing. Every bit of it. Amen. To
[1:37:41] make sure and watch over his sheep. The
[1:37:43] whole thing is to take care of all this
[1:37:46] is for him. All that we do, everything,
[1:37:49] it's all for him, for his glory, for his
[1:37:52] honor. It's not to bring any, again, not
[1:37:55] to lead anybody to a person, to a
[1:37:58] church, to a pastor, but it's to lead
[1:38:00] them to Christ.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; That's the whole thing. We all to be led
[1:38:04] to Christ, not to a doctrine, not to a
[1:38:06] dogma, not not to some uh ideology of

[1:43:34] prognosis there might be
[1:43:38] uh that brother Dennis might be with us.
[1:43:41] Uh, I I'd really like to have the
[1:43:43] community footwashing like we said
[1:43:44] before. Um, so Lord will I want to do it
[1:43:48] first year. Mike was gone. Brother
[1:43:49] Dennis had been well. I kind of like to
[1:43:51] have if we can. If not, we'll we'll work
[1:43:54] it out either way. But, uh, as the new
[1:43:56] year began, I like to kind of have the
[1:43:59] communion. So, Lord willing, uh, I will
[1:44:02] announce that to you. We'll find out. If
[1:44:04] it looks like he's going to be gone a
[1:44:06] good while, then we'll probably just go
[1:44:07] ahead and have it. But, I'll let you
[1:44:09] know. and uh but just be in prayer about
[1:44:11] that. See what the Lord will do. But
[1:44:13] it's been on my heart. So just trust uh
[1:44:16] we get that here real shortly. So God
[1:44:18] richly bless you. Amen. I don't have to

[1:44:36] a second job interview Tuesday with a
[1:44:39] different company. So,
[1:44:42] thank you all for pray for praying
[1:44:44] because it seems like since I redid my
[1:44:47] resume, I'm getting all these now
[1:44:50] responses and they want to have phone
[1:44:52] screenings and that. So, I have another
[1:44:54] interview different company on Tuesday.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; So, it's not a second interview.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; It's it's a second interview.
[1:45:03] But with like I've already had one
[1:45:05] interview. So I've had like a first
[1:45:06] interview. Now I have another interview
[1:45:08] with another company. Okay.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; So it's I'm getting
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; and then I have like a third phone
[1:45:14] screen with another. So it's all these
[1:45:17] interviews in a row with these different
[1:45:18] companies.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; It's been a very long time and
[1:45:22] unexpected in this economy. So
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Jobs are
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; being created all the time. It's it's
[1:45:28] kind of a weird time right now. Yeah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Different being laid off but other
[1:45:33] things that are coming about. So Lord
[1:45:35] knows
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; he takes care of his own.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember Tuesday.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Anyone else then?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:47] I've been studying uh in the Bible, King
[1:45:51] James Bible online
[1:45:54] about pastors and getting that verse and
[1:45:58] going through different verses and it's
[1:46:01] so overwhelming.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I have a greater respect for you.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; and I appreciate you staying on the word
[1:46:10] right there. So, I
[1:46:13] thank you for that. That means a lot to
[1:46:15] me.
[1:46:17] I know how Sister has felt. We've been
[1:46:20] together for a long time now. I guess
[1:46:22] almost since we moved to Tucson. So that
[1:46:24] means a lot. Even when we were in the
[1:46:26] mountains, the Lord had them in the
[1:46:27] mountains when we were up there and then
[1:46:29] brought them back down here waking up.
[1:46:31] So that means a lot to me. I appreciate
[1:46:33] that very much. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:37] Remember all the prayer requests. Amen.
[1:46:39] Just keep those before the Lord. And God
[1:46:40] bless you. Bless you. Amen. We'll be
[1:46:42] dismissed in the word of prayer. and our
[1:46:44] head as we could. Lord Jesus, it's
[1:46:47] privileged to have been here, God, and
[1:46:48] once again in your house. Thank you,
[1:46:50] Lord, for the invitation. Thank you for
[1:46:52] making us feel welcome. Thank you, Lord,
[1:46:54] for vis visiting and being with us here
[1:46:56] today, God. Thank you for speaking to us
[1:46:59] from your word. And Lord, we just trust
[1:47:01] all our worship, God, was a sweet
[1:47:02] smelling savior to you. Now, God, as we
[1:47:05] leave this place, God, may you be with
[1:47:07] each one of us and keep us in your
[1:47:09] protective care. May you just help us
[1:47:11] along the journey, God, and whatever
[1:47:12] this week, if we granted the whole week.
[1:47:14] Lord, if we're granted tomorrow,
[1:47:16] whatever it may be, God, you just watch
[1:47:18] over us and keep us through it. We
[1:47:20] commit ourselves to you. Help those that
[1:47:22] weren't able to make it. Lord, we just
[1:47:23] lift up the prayer requests before you
[1:47:25] again. We just pray that your Holy
[1:47:27] Spirit would move and measure and meet
[1:47:29] upon each one, God, your perfect will.
[1:47:32] We just commit ourselves to you now,
[1:47:34] Lord, and be with us as we go our ways
[1:47:35] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[1:47:40] today.
