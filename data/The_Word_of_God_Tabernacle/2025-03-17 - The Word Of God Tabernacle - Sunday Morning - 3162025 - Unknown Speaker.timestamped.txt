[34:59] bless you again today amen we have a
[35:01] couple prayer requests sister matis is
[35:03] not with us today uh still isolating am
[35:06] man she felt like she had gotten double
[35:08] pneumonia so uh she's still feeling
[35:12] better but still isolating so please
[35:14] remember her in prayer she said she's be
[35:16] watching with us today hopefully Lord
[35:17] will and she is God bless you Sister
[35:19] mati I did not hear from Sister Julie um
[35:23] her results she' had that thing they had
[35:26] to put on her the probes and stuff to
[35:28] make sure she's okay and get her license
[35:31] back so uh but I hadn't spoke to her
[35:34] about that since and my wife's not
[35:37] saying anything so I'm guessing she
[35:38] hasn't either so amen but please
[35:40] remember Sister Julie in prayer uh also
[35:43] got a prayer request from Sister Lydia
[35:45] today or last night
[35:47] actually uh most of you sisters probably
[35:50] got it she sent the text to you sisters
[35:52] but she was supposed to go in today they
[35:54] did a u a test of some kind I don't
[35:58] understand at all I told Micah he could
[36:00] explain it but the bottom line is we
[36:02] need to remember Sister Lydia in prayer
[36:04] she went last Thursday some of her
[36:06] results didn't look quite right uh to
[36:09] the doctor so they brought her in today
[36:12] uh which I me and my wife thought was
[36:14] fairly unusual on a Sunday but uh I
[36:18] guess maybe they thought it was that
[36:19] important so she's going to the doctor
[36:22] uh today to do some more tests and
[36:25] things run I could explain a little
[36:27] different but just please remember her
[36:29] in prayer amen that the Lord would just
[36:31] continue to touch she's felt good she's
[36:33] been wanting to come back to church and
[36:36] just it seems like every time she gets
[36:37] that gun to come back to church uh
[36:40] something else slams her so uh but we're
[36:43] believing together binding our faith
[36:45] together for sister Lydia the Lord would
[36:47] just bless and help her amen and
[36:49] believing those tests are going to come
[36:51] out positive in her for for in her favor
[36:54] amen and you never know what to say if
[36:57] you should say positive or negative
[36:59] negative means it's not good but
[37:01] negative means that nothing's there but
[37:03] positive means that something's there
[37:04] but positive so for her
[37:07] betterment amen praise the Lord that's
[37:10] the thing that uh we we want the most
[37:13] brother Dennis gave me a prayer request
[37:15] please pray for Leah his wife on the
[37:17] 27th she will have her gallbladder
[37:20] removed uh and we're believing together
[37:22] that all will go well uh as the Lord
[37:25] takes control praise the Lord so
[37:27] remember that for brother Dennis's wife
[37:30] Leah the Lord would just bless that and
[37:32] U guide the hand of the doctor and all
[37:34] will go well praise the Lord anyone have
[37:37] an unspoken request on your heart amen
[37:41] Lord knows all our needs to make good to
[37:42] see each one of you K's your next door

[50:57] we've gone over several times uh that
[50:59] word if you look that word up that word
[51:02] does not mean sinless Perfection it
[51:04] means a mature or full age amen when
[51:07] Jesus is saying be you therefore perfect
[51:09] he's not expecting us as humans to be
[51:12] sinlessly perfect but to grow up and to
[51:15] be mature to be a full age amen
[51:18] amen that's what the Lord is expecting
[51:20] of us today especially in the day and
[51:23] the hour that we live amen let's go over
[51:26] to Leviticus
[51:27] uh I want to start our context of the
[51:29] word here uh that we want to speak on
[51:31] today again this is adoption 8 maturity
[51:34] part three amen maturity part three I
[51:38] want to go back over to uh or go to
[51:41] Leviticus uh chapter 23 that's where I
[51:44] want to start my uh the reading today if
[51:46] we could Leviticus 3 uh
[51:49] 23 Leviticus 23 we'll begin with verse 9
[51:54] I want to read through and then we'll go
[51:57] back and uh and pick these things up as
[51:59] we uh and see what the Lord's speaking
[52:01] to us here as we pick each portion of
[52:04] this up uh Leviticus 23:9 and the Lord
[52:08] spake unto Moses
[52:10] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[52:12] and say unto them when you become when
[52:14] you become come into the land which I
[52:16] give unto you and shall reap the Harvest
[52:19] thereof then you shall bring a sheath of
[52:22] the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[52:24] the priest and he shall shall wave the
[52:27] sheath before the Lord to be accepted
[52:30] for you on the tomorrow after the
[52:32] Sabbath the priest shall wave it and you
[52:34] shall offer that day when you wave the
[52:37] sheath and heam without blemish of the
[52:40] first year for a burnt offering unto the
[52:42] Lord the meal offering thereof shall be
[52:44] two tenth deals of fine flour mingled
[52:46] with oil an offering made by fire unto
[52:49] the Lord for a sweet smelling Savior and
[52:51] the drink offering thereof shall be of
[52:54] wine the fourth part of a hen and ye
[52:56] shall eat neither bread nor parched corn
[52:59] nor green ears until the selfsame day
[53:01] that he uh that ye have brought an
[53:04] offering unto your God it shall be a
[53:06] statute forever throughout your
[53:08] generations and all your dwellings and
[53:11] ye shall count unto you from the
[53:14] tomorrow after the Sabbath from the day
[53:17] that you brought the sheep of the wave
[53:19] offering seven Sabbath shall be complete
[53:23] even until the tomorrow after the
[53:24] seventh shab Sabbath shall ye number 50
[53:28] days and ye shall offer a new meat
[53:30] offering unto the Lord you shall bring
[53:33] out of your habitations two uh wave
[53:36] loaves of T of two t Deals they shall be
[53:40] a fine flower they shall be bacon with
[53:43] leaven they are the first fruits unto
[53:46] the Lord now let's Look What the Lord is
[53:48] trying to speech us because we know that
[53:51] all the Old Testament is the type and
[53:53] Shadow of the New Testament and Christ
[53:55] revealing to us of course today uh
[53:58] through the truth of the revelation of
[53:59] the word that uh of what this word was
[54:02] speaking at this time as God was having
[54:04] them do this in a practical sense what
[54:07] God was doing to to I to identify and to
[54:10] announce his coming and to identify and
[54:13] announce the coming of the oncoming
[54:15] bride amen and the bride ages the church
[54:18] ages in the bride age amen so let's go
[54:21] back and read and look at what the Lord
[54:23] is speaking because he spoke unto Moses
[54:25] speak to the children of Israel we're
[54:27] going back to the ninth verse now amen
[54:30] back to the ninth verse I wanted to read
[54:32] it all first because sometimes the the
[54:35] the the the purpose gets lost a as we
[54:40] begin to go through it right amen so I
[54:43] wanted to read through it so you could
[54:44] listen to hear what God was telling
[54:46] Moses the children of Israel to do for
[54:49] this purpose before we broke it down and
[54:52] understanding the points that God is
[54:54] trying to make here now speak on now
[54:56] again the ninth verse 10th verse speak
[54:59] unto the children of Israel and say unto
[55:01] them when ye become come into the land
[55:05] which I give unto you praise the Lord
[55:08] that's the number one thing to remember
[55:10] it's God is always the one that gives
[55:13] God is always the one that does it if
[55:15] there's any blessings if there's any
[55:17] good thing if there's anything to brag
[55:18] about it's God that's does it amen God
[55:22] is the one that gives he wants them to
[55:24] understand I give you this land yeah
[55:27] you're working it and you're planting it
[55:29] you're sewing it and you're reaping it
[55:32] but but I gave it to you yes amen
[55:35] understand that it was by the power of
[55:37] my hand amen now they had to go take it
[55:40] praise the Lord but it's by the power of
[55:42] my hand that you had this land I gave
[55:46] you this land and shall reap the Harvest
[55:50] thereof then ye shall bring a sheath of
[55:53] the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[55:56] the priests so after this land I've gave
[55:59] you after you've planted it sewed it
[56:02] after you've reaped it you need to take
[56:04] of the first of the grain that came to
[56:07] the point of maturity because a a good
[56:11] farmer waits till his crop is mature
[56:13] before he reaps it right uh a good
[56:16] farmer is not going to go take of the
[56:19] fruit of the land before it's ready to
[56:21] be partaken of yes amen they wait till
[56:24] it comes to a place of maturity uh we
[56:26] have a lot of fruit trees where we live
[56:28] and we know if you go pick a fruit when
[56:30] it's green uh doesn't taste very good uh
[56:34] it's not going to satisfy it's not going
[56:36] to serve its purpose you got to wait for
[56:38] that fruit to become mature and a lot of
[56:40] times uh it has to set in the sun before
[56:43] it can actually ripen and come to a
[56:45] place of maturity in fact I found out
[56:47] especially with a lot of the fruits at
[56:49] are at where we live that the the
[56:52] sweetest fruits are in the top of the
[56:53] tree right that gets the that get gets
[56:56] the Lion Share of the sun amen the that
[57:00] that gets the most Sun praise the Lord
[57:03] is the one that's the sweetest so a lot
[57:06] of times we uh we have Joel or maybe
[57:09] even Emma now climb up in the tree to go
[57:12] up and get a fruit that's way up in the
[57:13] top uh they also give we give a picker
[57:16] that you can go pick but when you get up
[57:18] in the top is up there where it gets the
[57:20] most Sun amen praise the Lord not just
[57:24] the Su n but the s o n when it gets a
[57:27] lot the most of the sun that's where
[57:28] it's the sweetest that's when it tastes
[57:31] the best when it gets to that place of
[57:33] of riping and maturing and when it gets
[57:36] to that mature place then it it becomes
[57:38] consumable it becomes edible it becomes
[57:40] even a desire to eat because it tastes
[57:43] so good amen but now what God's telling
[57:45] them now this land that I've gave you
[57:48] you've planted it you've sewed it but
[57:50] now the first that comes to the place
[57:52] where it's mature enough for you to reap
[57:54] when it becomes mature enough for you to
[57:56] be able to take and to get ready to
[57:59] prepare for consumption I wanted you to
[58:01] take the first bundle of that which is
[58:04] sheep is just a bundle of the stalks
[58:06] that's taken up if they take up and of
[58:09] course they didn't have big huge
[58:11] Harvester machines they did everything
[58:13] by hand they grab it and whack it off
[58:15] with a sickle or whatever uh knife they
[58:17] used and they would take them when they
[58:18] got a nice big bundle of sheath of
[58:21] mature grain amen they to take that and
[58:24] bundle it together so you got got a
[58:26] bunch of loose grain a bunch of loose
[58:29] stalks all uh individual stalks but
[58:33] they're bound together amen they're
[58:35] bound together which is the best that
[58:37] they could do Under the blood of bulls
[58:39] and ghosts the best they could do was to
[58:41] be able to come together in in Loosely
[58:45] fit group amen together uh and that's
[58:49] what the sheath represented it was a
[58:51] bundle it was a bundle of those that
[58:53] they brought together that was Loosely
[58:55] they were bound together amen by one
[58:58] purpose amen by one person by one God
[59:02] they were all bound together but they
[59:03] were still loose leaves they were still
[59:05] loose stalks that were there but the
[59:07] priest was to to take that stalk to take
[59:11] that sheep and they were to take it to
[59:13] the priest the priest was supposed to
[59:15] take that and wave that over the people
[59:19] as the wave offering that sheath was to
[59:22] be waved over the people as a wave
[59:24] offering to recognize
[59:26] God did this for you God gave this to us
[59:30] this is the fruit that we're partaking
[59:32] of because of God's goodness to us amen
[59:36] this is a representation of what God has
[59:38] given us it's also a representation to
[59:42] say that this is just the beginning amen
[59:45] this is just the first the first fruit
[59:48] this is just the first one that came to
[59:51] maturity that's waved over the people it
[59:54] represents not just only only of course
[59:57] the loose knit of the stalks together
[59:59] and of God giving it to wave over the
[1:00:01] people as a reminder of who gave them
[1:00:04] that land and why they're able to
[1:00:06] partake of that but it's also a
[1:00:09] signification that this is just the
[1:00:11] first one of many amen this is just the
[1:00:15] beginning this is just the start of the
[1:00:18] Harvest that you're going to enjoy
[1:00:21] because of God's goodness this is just
[1:00:23] the first one take the first one and
[1:00:26] wave it over the people let let it be a
[1:00:28] reminder let them understand that I am
[1:00:32] your God Amen and and and and to me only
[1:00:36] do you worship me only do you praise
[1:00:40] amen amen and this is just to signify
[1:00:43] that the same God that gave you this one
[1:00:46] is the same God that's going to give you
[1:00:47] all the other yeah right God is going to
[1:00:50] continue to bless the land God is going
[1:00:53] to continue to bless you because
[1:00:56] God is the one that that gives the
[1:00:59] blessings to begin with yes if we can
[1:01:02] recognize understand it's God that gives
[1:01:05] it amen it's like we uh preached when we
[1:01:08] talked about tithe and offering and
[1:01:09] money and and things that the Lord
[1:01:11] blesses us with and the scripture says
[1:01:14] Oh by by my strength have I gotten this
[1:01:16] wealth no it's
[1:01:18] not God gives it amen and you know how
[1:01:22] quickly God can take it away from you
[1:01:24] just like that
[1:01:26] if he desires to praise the Lord that's
[1:01:29] why we give amen that's why God give
[1:01:32] this is just a recognition this is just
[1:01:35] the beginning amen I am your God you are
[1:01:39] my people and this is just the start
[1:01:41] this is just the first one to be waved
[1:01:43] up the first one that came to a place of
[1:01:46] maturity the first one that got to a
[1:01:49] place of usage amen because before the
[1:01:53] maturity it was it it it hit or or you
[1:01:57] you you don't want to pluck a fruit
[1:01:58] again that's not mature this is the
[1:02:01] first one enjoy it because this is a
[1:02:04] sheep of the first fruits and he had the
[1:02:07] priest wave it amen not the farmer not
[1:02:11] the one that grew it not the tribes
[1:02:14] whose land it belongs to but the priest
[1:02:17] that was their job right that was their
[1:02:19] position because God recognized that
[1:02:22] position because he's the one that
[1:02:24] instituted it God's the one that
[1:02:26] instituted the priesthood so God's the
[1:02:28] one that recognizes that priesthood so
[1:02:31] you take that to the priest because that
[1:02:33] priest is consecrated that priest is in
[1:02:36] the position of consecration to do it on
[1:02:39] my behalf take it to him right amen and
[1:02:42] then let him wave it over the people
[1:02:44] amen not just for him but for all the
[1:02:47] people we all benefit because of God's
[1:02:50] because of what God's did now first
[1:02:53] fruits look now they shall reap the
[1:02:55] Harvest then shall bring the sheep of
[1:02:57] the first fruits of the Harvest the
[1:03:00] first to come to
[1:03:02] maturity unto the priest and he shall
[1:03:05] wave the Sheep before the Lord to be
[1:03:08] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:03:12] the pre after the Sabbath the priest
[1:03:14] shall wave it praise the Lord the priest
[1:03:17] shall wave now what is
[1:03:20] it I may be getting a little too deep
[1:03:22] here but what what happens when we reach
[1:03:26] a Sabbath
[1:03:28] day we consider the Sabbath day the
[1:03:31] seventh day of the week and we number
[1:03:33] our weeks in sevens which is God's
[1:03:36] completion amen we number our weeks in
[1:03:39] sevens so what happens after the seventh
[1:03:43] day amen amen we start over a new week
[1:03:47] again praise the Lord so we can go to
[1:03:49] the holy convocations to get it more
[1:03:51] into that uh uh the the feast days of
[1:03:54] the scripture and the holy convocation
[1:03:56] of the eighth day but there's a rolling
[1:03:59] over of a of a new week so many times we
[1:04:04] we do it we do it all the time we do it
[1:04:06] for the newness of weeks we do it
[1:04:09] sometimes for the newness of days we
[1:04:12] wake up it's a new day we do it with the
[1:04:15] newness of weeks oh it's a new week this
[1:04:17] going to be a good week we do it with
[1:04:19] the newness of months sometimes we
[1:04:22] definitely do it with the newness of
[1:04:23] years with all of our resolutions and
[1:04:25] all that stuff that hardly anybody ever
[1:04:27] keeps any of but we do it all the time
[1:04:31] it's a rolling over it's a new beginning
[1:04:33] if you will amen well that's what the
[1:04:36] scripture did uh that that God showed
[1:04:39] was was a new beginning so each week is
[1:04:42] a new beginning as the seven as you get
[1:04:45] past or beyond the seventh you roll over
[1:04:48] into a newness of a new week a new day
[1:04:52] praise the Lord so the oldest past the
[1:04:55] oldest done this is the new and wave the
[1:04:58] sheath this is the beginning praise the
[1:05:01] Lord this is the start let's continue
[1:05:03] and and he shall offer that day when ye
[1:05:07] wave the sheath and heland without
[1:05:10] blemish of the first year for a burnt
[1:05:12] offering unto the Lord uh and of course
[1:05:14] we know that represents Christ as the
[1:05:17] sheath of the waving amen notice there's
[1:05:20] no leaven offered in here amen no leaven
[1:05:24] offered amen and the meat offering shall
[1:05:29] be uh uh thereof shall be two10 deals of
[1:05:32] fine flour mingled with oil amen mingled
[1:05:37] with oil remember on the day of

[1:05:47] purposes amen Amen on and In Praise the
[1:05:51] Lord we'll go to that in a minute so as
[1:05:54] we go in back as we go into to that keep
[1:05:56] this in your mind mingled with oil not
[1:05:59] not uh one with it but just mingled with
[1:06:02] it praise the lord it's like having a
[1:06:05] it's like having a a a a I'm trying to
[1:06:09] think of a different word but a glob of
[1:06:12] that's probably not a great word but a
[1:06:16] just a glob of dough and you put oil on
[1:06:19] it and the oil is mingled with the dough
[1:06:23] the oil is not one with the dough
[1:06:26] it's just mingled with the dough
[1:06:28] understand okay so this two10 deal of
[1:06:32] fine flour is mingled with
[1:06:34] oil an offering made by fire unto the
[1:06:38] Lord for a sweet smelling for a sweet
[1:06:41] savior now notice we've got an
[1:06:42] introduction of fire praise the Lord
[1:06:44] keep that in mind as well and the drink
[1:06:47] offering thereof shall be of wine which
[1:06:49] is again just the stimulation we know
[1:06:51] the stimulation of Revelation spoke of
[1:06:53] in Revelation five uh 56 I think it is
[1:06:58] the the oil the stimulation amen uh of
[1:07:02] the of the spirit of God uh the fourth
[1:07:05] part of an hen and ye shall eat neither
[1:07:07] bread nor parch corn nor green ears

[1:07:26] after the Sabbath and we've got a
[1:07:28] tomorrow after the Sabbath where we've
[1:07:30] had a new beginning amen rolls over into
[1:07:33] a new beginning uh which would which
[1:07:38] would represent the the newness of
[1:07:42] life after now look here you should
[1:07:44] count from the tomorrow from that time
[1:07:47] after the Sabbath from the day that you
[1:07:49] brought the sheath of the wave offering
[1:07:52] seven Sabbath shall be complete
[1:07:56] seven sabbaths representing the seven
[1:07:58] Church ages shall be complete notice
[1:08:02] after that time of the waving praise the
[1:08:05] Lord let's keep going uh un even unto
[1:08:09] the tomorrow after the seventh sh
[1:08:11] Sabbath shall ye number 50 days which we
[1:08:14] know is is is Jubilee is is freedom is
[1:08:18] Liberty is is releasing amen that's 50
[1:08:21] is represents Jubilee in the scripture
[1:08:24] and ye shall offer a new B uh meat
[1:08:26] offering unto the Lord 17th verse and ye
[1:08:29] shall bring out of your
[1:08:32] habitations two wave
[1:08:35] loaves amen they're no longer sheep
[1:08:39] they're
[1:08:40] loaves praise the Lord the she have been
[1:08:44] taken and made into
[1:08:47] loaves first you had a mingling of oil
[1:08:51] that was with them and
[1:08:53] fire which would bring about a result of
[1:08:57] of bringing the oil and and the meal the
[1:09:02] the the flour the dough together to make
[1:09:06] it to bake it into
[1:09:09] one now there was a time when it was
[1:09:11] mingled with oil that you could look and
[1:09:13] you could separate or you could
[1:09:16] differentiate between what was oil and
[1:09:18] what was dough but once it gets baked it
[1:09:22] all bakes in it vulcanized
[1:09:25] I trying to keep from using that word
[1:09:27] because you might not know what that
[1:09:28] means but that basically is vulcanized
[1:09:30] just means you take two substance and by
[1:09:33] heat those two substance become one
[1:09:35] right that's that's basically what that
[1:09:38] means so now you've got two loaves what
[1:09:41] is a loaf a loaf is taking of the of the
[1:09:45] grain with the mingled oil and baking it
[1:09:48] with fire together to where now it's not
[1:09:50] a bunch of loose leaves together it's
[1:09:52] one baked loaf amen praise God it's no
[1:09:57] longer a bunch of uh loose grain it's no
[1:10:00] longer a bunch of stalks that are out
[1:10:02] that are bound together it is a group
[1:10:05] now that has come together that has been
[1:10:08] uh waved over the people amen is is
[1:10:11] waved over the people a group that is
[1:10:13] now baked together into one loaf praise
[1:10:17] the Lord or or a loaf it says two loaves
[1:10:19] here two two wave loaves of two 10 steel
[1:10:24] they shall uh they shall be of fine
[1:10:26] flour which the fine flow just
[1:10:28] represents Jesus Christ again they shall
[1:10:30] be bacon amen with Le they are the first
[1:10:35] fruits unto the Lord notice this is
[1:10:38] after the seven sabbaths and the Jubilee
[1:10:41] after the seven Church ages in through
[1:10:44] that last Church age as we enter into a
[1:10:46] bride age amen there Comes A Time with
[1:10:50] which I say now is for this bride after
[1:10:54] all the church ages from the day of
[1:10:56] Pentecost till today has come to that
[1:10:58] place of maturity amen we must be at
[1:11:02] that place of maturity the bride through
[1:11:05] the word must be to that place of
[1:11:07] maturity as mature Christians not babies
[1:11:11] not fussing about gifts and this and
[1:11:13] that and back and forth no but mature
[1:11:16] Christians in the word by the revelation
[1:11:19] of the word remember we talked last week
[1:11:22] about when brother Ram said that uh uh
[1:11:24] Power without character is satanic and
[1:11:27] my challenge to you and my observation
[1:11:29] was what if power without character is
[1:11:32] satanic what is power with character
[1:11:35] right it's going to be just the opposite
[1:11:38] right if power without character is
[1:11:40] satanic then power with character is
[1:11:42] going to be just the opposite power with
[1:11:45] character is Godly amen praise the Lord
[1:11:48] and that's what the bride should have
[1:11:49] Hal of today remember she'll only say
[1:11:53] what he says she'll keep keep still
[1:11:55] unless she's got thus sayith the Lord
[1:11:57] right well yesterday the Lord showed me
[1:12:00] something in addition to
[1:12:02] that power without character is satanic
[1:12:06] power with character is Godly yes what
[1:12:09] is the word without a proper
[1:12:12] Revelation what is the word without
[1:12:15] proper interpretation or Revelation
[1:12:17] right that's also satanic yes it is
[1:12:20] right so if that is satanic what is the
[1:12:23] word with proper Revelation and
[1:12:27] interpretation it's Godly amen that's
[1:12:32] the maturity that God is bringing the
[1:12:33] bride to amen the bride the word with
[1:12:37] Revelation the word with the proper
[1:12:39] interpretation or I I hate using
[1:12:42] interpretation because that's up for
[1:12:44] interpretation but by Revelation the
[1:12:47] word with Revelation cuz Revelation
[1:12:49] comes from God right amen God's
[1:12:52] revelation when God reveals it through
[1:12:54] what the word word says it it goes it
[1:12:57] brings us right back to growing in Grace
[1:13:00] and knowledge yes praise the Lord the
[1:13:04] word with the revelation of God on it is
[1:13:07] Godly and that is what the bride speaks
[1:13:10] that is what the mature bride speaks the
[1:13:14] bride that is now one loaf she's not a
[1:13:17] bunch of stalks out just bound together
[1:13:20] amen like they were on the day of
[1:13:21] Pentecost when they came in on the day
[1:13:23] of Pentecost it was 20 of them Milling
[1:13:26] around talking around sitting around
[1:13:27] whatever they were doing amen I'm sure
[1:13:30] at one point in time they finally got to
[1:13:31] the place that they prayed or they
[1:13:33] worshiped the Lord and they they they
[1:13:35] got into one mind and one Accord they
[1:13:37] got into one Spirit somehow yeah and the
[1:13:40] Bible doesn't explain how uh we kind of
[1:13:42] got a feeling or understanding of that
[1:13:44] when we here get into one mind and one
[1:13:46] Accord and when we get in one mind and
[1:13:48] one Accord we know what happens yes
[1:13:51] praise God so we can have a little idea
[1:13:53] of what they went through on the day of
[1:13:55] Pentecost when 120 L loose people came
[1:13:59] in and they walked out the door yes as
[1:14:02] one
[1:14:03] Lo praise the Lord as one group of
[1:14:06] people as one loaf that had came and was
[1:14:10] brought together and vulcanized with the
[1:14:13] Holy Ghost and Fire that brought them
[1:14:15] all together they didn't leave together
[1:14:18] yeah they were still if you looked at
[1:14:20] them separate people but we're not
[1:14:22] talking about looks we're talking about
[1:14:24] the spirit in the spirit they were one
[1:14:27] person one mind one Accord praise the
[1:14:30] Lord but now look I want you to notice
[1:14:32] something though even with that even
[1:14:34] with the understanding the spirit of God
[1:14:36] took control over them look at what the
[1:14:39] word says we're going to finish this
[1:14:40] here the two loaves of 10 two10 deal
[1:14:45] they shall be a fine flower amen
[1:14:47] representing Christ they shall be bacon
[1:14:50] praise the Lord the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:14:52] yes with leaven
[1:14:55] praise the Lord with leaven now why now
[1:14:59] is there leaven now notice this this is
[1:15:03] we're talking about even at the end of
[1:15:04] the church age ages Saints amen why now
[1:15:09] is there leaven no mention of Leaven
[1:15:12] before right there's been no there's
[1:15:15] been no mention of Leaven you talk about
[1:15:17] the waving of the sheep and uh that
[1:15:19] represented Christ well there's no
[1:15:21] leaven because there was no leaven in
[1:15:23] Christ right yeah Christ was perfect
[1:15:26] amen there was no leaven but now there's
[1:15:29] leav why is there leav because we are
[1:15:32] still
[1:15:33] human we are still
[1:15:37] carnal we are still individual human
[1:15:39] beings that have sin in our lives that
[1:15:43] have mistakes faults failures
[1:15:45] shortcomings we're still human beings
[1:15:48] that have these things in our lives and
[1:15:50] as human beings are we are still
[1:15:53] fallible thus the these loaves that are
[1:15:56] now baked together they still have
[1:15:58] leaven in them even though they're baked
[1:16:01] together even though they come together
[1:16:03] as one even though we are united
[1:16:05] together and and brought together as one
[1:16:08] people because God's not coming for a a
[1:16:11] bunch of wives God is coming for one
[1:16:14] woman amen not a little girl one woman
[1:16:18] his bride God is coming to take his
[1:16:21] bride home amen one woman praise the
[1:16:24] Lord Lord because she's all come
[1:16:26] together in the spirit come together as
[1:16:29] one but now in our Humanity we still
[1:16:33] have
[1:16:34] le amen we still have mistakes we still
[1:16:37] have faults we still have things that we
[1:16:39] deal with and go through in life we
[1:16:41] still have pardon and expression but we
[1:16:43] still have imperfections right we still
[1:16:46] have things that we're working on we
[1:16:48] still have things that we're dealing
[1:16:49] with but that that that does not change
[1:16:53] the fact that you're mature mure person
[1:16:55] a mature Christian amen amen I I I might
[1:17:01] I might have I've been driving a car
[1:17:04] for going on 50 years some of you longer
[1:17:08] than
[1:17:09] me been driving for 50 years by the
[1:17:12] grace of God I had got I had been in an
[1:17:14] accident in probably
[1:17:16] 30 by the grace of God I want to make
[1:17:18] that be well known by the grace of God
[1:17:22] in probably 30
[1:17:23] years but I could walk out this door and
[1:17:26] get behind the wheel of a car and have
[1:17:27] another
[1:17:28] r that doesn't mean I all of a sudden
[1:17:30] become a
[1:17:31] child I'm not all of a sudden a baby
[1:17:34] again or someone Unworthy of a of a
[1:17:37] driver's license I didn't drink I didn't
[1:17:40] do drugs I wasn't impaired I just made a
[1:17:42] mistake right you understand what I'm
[1:17:45] saying yes that's the point I'm trying
[1:17:46] to make amen it doesn't mean you're
[1:17:49] you're not mature you just made a
[1:17:51] mistake slipped up said something you
[1:17:53] shouldn't thought something you should
[1:17:55] whatever but you make it right to the
[1:17:57] Lord oh God forgive me remember get a
[1:17:59] hold of yourself Lord forgive me I'm
[1:18:01] sorry I didn't mean to do that I didn't
[1:18:03] mean to act that way I didn't mean to be
[1:18:04] like that but we're still sticky in this
[1:18:07] sticky Cleber flesh with leav still with
[1:18:11] Le amen praise the Lord let's go I want
[1:18:14] to finish this over to U uh First
[1:18:18] Corinthians I want to read this before
[1:18:20] we go back over to acts 1 Corinthians
[1:18:26] I want to leave off with acts because
[1:18:29] that's kind of going to Kickstart us
[1:18:31] into next week Lord
[1:18:34] willing look now it's the rising of the
[1:18:37] sun oh this is beautiful look notice
[1:18:40] while you're turning there to First
[1:18:42] Corinthians um uh ver chapter 15 1
[1:18:46] Corinthians chapter
[1:18:48] 15 notice he said it was the first corn
[1:18:51] of God's wheat that had been raised from
[1:18:54] the
[1:18:55] dead praise the Lord God's first corn of
[1:18:59] wheat now let's look as we read this
[1:19:03] I'll finish that in a minute but let's
[1:19:05] read 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 12
[1:19:09] now if Christ be preached that he rose
[1:19:11] from the dead how say some among you
[1:19:14] that there is no resurrection of the
[1:19:16] dead but if there be no resurrection of
[1:19:19] the dead then is Christ not risen and if
[1:19:23] Christ be not risen then is our
[1:19:25] preaching Vain and your faith also
[1:19:29] vain yay and we are found false
[1:19:32] Witnesses of God because we have
[1:19:34] testified of God that he raised up
[1:19:37] Christ whom he raised not up if so uh
[1:19:40] raise he he raised not up if so be that
[1:19:44] the dead rise not for if the dead rise
[1:19:48] not then is not Christ raised and if
[1:19:51] Christ be not be not raised your faith
[1:19:55] is vain ye are yet in your
[1:19:59] sins then they also which are fallen
[1:20:02] asleep in Christ are perished oh God
[1:20:06] have mercy amen what a horrible picture
[1:20:08] that would
[1:20:10] be if in the 19th verse if in this life
[1:20:14] only we have hope in Christ we are all
[1:20:18] men most miserable right shall I
[1:20:21] emphasize that I don't think I need to I
[1:20:24] think you you know what it means yes you
[1:20:26] know what he's talking about if this is
[1:20:28] if this is all we have to look forward
[1:20:30] to Saints kill me
[1:20:32] now I I I still would rather deal with
[1:20:35] what's on the other side than what I'm
[1:20:36] dealing with now if this is all we got
[1:20:39] we are for certain uh a people most
[1:20:43] miserable amen thank God that's not
[1:20:47] it 21st but now is Christ risen from the
[1:20:51] dead and become the first fruits of them
[1:20:54] that that slept right why because he's
[1:20:57] the first one that rose from the dead
[1:20:59] right praise the
[1:21:01] Lord for Since By Man Came Death by man
[1:21:04] came also the resurrection of the
[1:21:08] Dead for as in Adam all died even so in
[1:21:13] Christ shall all be made
[1:21:16] alive but every man in his own order
[1:21:18] Christ of first fruits afterward
[1:21:21] afterward they that are Christ at his
[1:21:25] coming praise the Lord so in this last
[1:21:28] day we know there's to be a resurrection
[1:21:32] we know there's to be a rapture we know
[1:21:35] that there's going to be life come on to
[1:21:37] this bride at the place and and those
[1:21:39] that sleep in Christ the where they will
[1:21:41] rise
[1:21:42] first they will appear unto many as they
[1:21:45] did in the scripture and they'll be with
[1:21:47] us in on the 40 days and they will all
[1:21:50] be caught up together with to meet the
[1:21:52] Lord in the air praise the Lord because
[1:21:56] he raised we can raise he was the first
[1:22:00] fruits praise the Lord now look there's
[1:22:02] got to be a time to where we all after
[1:22:06] that after that example come to a
[1:22:09] newness of Life come to a newness of the
[1:22:13] word notice through the church ages as
[1:22:16] we've
[1:22:17] said they as reformers probed at the
[1:22:21] word they brought what they had they
[1:22:24] brought what G God gave them the just
[1:22:27] shall live by just go back to Luther the
[1:22:29] just shall live by faith in Luther
[1:22:31] remember that was an in part but it was
[1:22:35] what God gave them and those that lived
[1:22:37] to that in that day were bride amen but
[1:22:41] when it switched over to a new day with
[1:22:45] Wesley Wesley introduced sanctification
[1:22:48] God gave a little more light right and
[1:22:50] as that little more light came onto that
[1:22:53] message sanctification was still only in
[1:22:57] part right but those that lived to that
[1:22:59] part they lived to that word they lived
[1:23:01] to what they knew they were bride yes
[1:23:05] remember seven sabbaths to this time now
[1:23:09] that had to come a time where there was
[1:23:12] a restoration of the gifts according to
[1:23:13] the scripture amen Joel said it in the
[1:23:17] last days Peter said it in the last days
[1:23:20] this is not what you say they are not
[1:23:22] drunk as you suppose the these are a
[1:23:25] fulfillment of the Prophet Joel that
[1:23:28] said he would pour out his Spirit upon
[1:23:30] All Flesh amen your young man shall see
[1:23:34] Visions your old man shall dream dreams
[1:23:36] right it's it's God unleashing his
[1:23:39] Spirit once again now when that died out
[1:23:42] through the church ages because that
[1:23:45] corn of wheat had to go on the ground
[1:23:47] and die and rot to come back to what a
[1:23:50] new life there had to be new life again
[1:23:54] that's the cycle of life amen the cycle
[1:23:58] of life every year you see seed planted
[1:24:01] you see growth coming forth you see
[1:24:04] plants amen winter comes around well
[1:24:07] maybe not in tuon most places when the
[1:24:10] winter comes around the plant dies the
[1:24:12] plant goes dormant doesn't die it goes
[1:24:15] dormant now some hot bed plants they
[1:24:18] might die the ones you got a baby and
[1:24:20] pamper and treat like they're queen and
[1:24:23] king and all you know them around they
[1:24:25] they they'll die when it comes when it
[1:24:27] comes time for the real Showdown they
[1:24:30] they die and go away but a true uh oak
[1:24:33] tree when that winter comes around it
[1:24:35] just takes it and that life comes back
[1:24:37] in it goes dormant the leaves fall off
[1:24:39] but what happens in the next spring when
[1:24:41] the sun comes the the the newness of
[1:24:43] that sun comes back up again and that
[1:24:46] tree starts filling and starts shaking

[1:24:58] the life that's in it the life
[1:25:00] identifies what it is the life
[1:25:02] identified it through those ages and the
[1:25:04] same thing God did through the church

[1:25:08] ground and die and rot to Res to

[1:25:12] New Life and as the stalk came and the
[1:25:16] the the just shall live by faith and
[1:25:18] then the the the blade and the
[1:25:19] sanctification and then the Shu with the
[1:25:22] restoration of the gifts when the rest

[1:25:26] was shouting and screaming and gifts
[1:25:28] manifesting and all this going we talked
[1:25:30] on last week but the word says that when
[1:25:34] that which is perfect is come that which
[1:25:36] is in part in part shall be done away
[1:25:40] with well if justification is part then
[1:25:43] we do away with it we don't need
[1:25:45] justification anymore right but see
[1:25:47] that's that's not the way it works all
[1:25:50] we do is we don't major on a minor
[1:25:52] anymore justification is just one step
[1:25:56] to get you to the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:58] Ghost and the indwelling presence of
[1:26:00] Christ in your soul amen that's just one
[1:26:03] step the next step is sanctification

[1:26:27] be something bring to a mature a place
[1:26:30] of maturity to control all that not to
[1:26:33] do away with it but again like we said
[1:26:35] last week to bring it into its proper
[1:26:37] place Amen to bring it into its uh uh
[1:26:41] into its useful position yes to
[1:26:44] understand as mature Christians you
[1:26:47] don't interrupt the ministry by standing
[1:26:49] up and speaking in tongues anymore or
[1:26:51] standing up and prophesying or getting
[1:26:53] and running around the building
[1:26:55] that's out of order we don't want things
[1:26:57] out of order we want things in order
[1:26:59] everything needs to be decently and in
[1:27:01] order praise the Lord nothing wrong with
[1:27:03] the gifts gifts are wonderful thank God
[1:27:05] for them nothing wrong with
[1:27:06] justification justification is necessary
[1:27:09] justification is what makes you the your
[1:27:13] sin never exist in God again right amen
[1:27:17] amen justification means you never did
[1:27:19] it in the first place so if you don't
[1:27:21] want justification friend I'm afraid
[1:27:23] you're in you're a heap of trouble yes
[1:27:26] justification says you never did it to
[1:27:28] begin with yes praise the Lord God puts
[1:27:30] it in the sea of forgetfulness never to
[1:27:32] be remembered anymore not against you
[1:27:35] it'll lay on the head of Satan till it
[1:27:36] Le till the day of judgment he'll be
[1:27:38] held guilty and accountable for it but
[1:27:39] not you right praise God because the
[1:27:42] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:27:44] all unrighteousness amen praise the Lord
[1:27:47] and it brings us to a newness of Life
[1:27:50] yes so there had to be a prophet for
[1:27:53] this last day amen there had to be a
[1:27:56] prophet for this last day Malachi
[1:27:59] prophesies on this many scripture that
[1:28:01] prophesy would read uh uh uh Luke
[1:28:06] 17:30 uh even thus shall it be in the
[1:28:09] day when the son of man is revealed
[1:28:11] there had to be a time where there it it
[1:28:15] had to finish all that was started had
[1:28:18] to be finished cuz this is the finished
[1:28:20] day this is the finished age this is the
[1:28:23] finished time the seventh Church age
[1:28:25] goes on to predition the bride age with
[1:28:28] the bride goes into a Rapture yes so
[1:28:32] there had to be a prophet to come and
[1:28:35] take all this loose ends and tie them
[1:28:38] all together yes amen and preach a
[1:28:40] message of Truth to a bride to bring
[1:28:43] that bride after the seventh sabbaths to
[1:28:46] a place of Liberation to a place of
[1:28:49] Jubilee to a place of freedom and
[1:28:51] there's no greater Freedom that you
[1:28:53] could ever have have than when you come
[1:28:55] to the place of maturity amen now a lot
[1:28:59] of times we consider mature age as
[1:29:02] humans uh when you reach 16 you can get
[1:29:06] a driver's license when you reach 18 you
[1:29:09] can vote which is way too low but anyway
[1:29:13] probably the driving is too uh way too
[1:29:15] low anyway when you get to the age of 18
[1:29:18] so we go by age not maturity level
[1:29:21] right most
[1:29:24] excuse me men but most Mal's frontal
[1:29:26] cortex brain ain't even fully developed
[1:29:28] until they're 21 22 23 years old but
[1:29:31] they can voted 18 yeah God help us 16
[1:29:35] can drive 3,000lb bullet down the road
[1:29:39] they can vote 18 Lord knows who they put
[1:29:41] in office at 21 they can drink hard
[1:29:45] liquor alcohol can drink at 21 so we put
[1:29:49] ages on things instead of maturity
[1:29:51] levels but that's not the way God does
[1:29:54] right God doesn't put age on it he puts
[1:29:56] maturity level on it God will only
[1:29:59] handle God will only let you handle give
[1:30:02] you that of the word that you can handle
[1:30:05] he'll only give you that of the word
[1:30:06] that you can handle God's not going to
[1:30:08] choke you to death with too much at one
[1:30:10] time uh he'll give to you as you have
[1:30:13] need of and and even brother say he give
[1:30:15] you things he'll reveal things to you as
[1:30:17] you have need of knowing them right amen
[1:30:20] as you have need of knowing them so well
[1:30:22] I have had a need of knowing this well
[1:30:24] maybe that's why the Lord hasn't brought
[1:30:26] it to you yet amen but there had to be a
[1:30:29] prophet with a message that brought this
[1:30:33] bride it down to the church ages but
[1:30:36] this last day
[1:30:37] bride from Leo deia into a bright
[1:30:41] age to bring her to a place of maturity
[1:30:45] because that's what God is coming he's
[1:30:47] coming for a bride amen again I've said
[1:30:50] this several times I'm going to say it
[1:30:51] again he's not coming for a little girl
[1:30:54] he's coming for a bride again I thought
[1:30:57] it was unusual that that man that wrote
[1:31:00] that article was writing A dissension of
[1:31:03] this message but then he wrote in
[1:31:04] dissension that we use the phrase
[1:31:06] message and bride I'm like have you read
[1:31:09] the Bible amen right you know that those
[1:31:13] that is in the Bible right right he's
[1:31:15] making fun like why would they be
[1:31:18] talking about bride because it's in the
[1:31:20] scripture God is going to have a bride a
[1:31:23] woman woman
[1:31:25] mature so this had to come to a place of
[1:31:28] mature in this last day because this
[1:31:31] last day is the day that takes the
[1:31:32] Rapture amen this is the time that God
[1:31:35] comes and takes his children home is now
[1:31:39] yes in this mature age where the where
[1:31:44] where it it's no longer several stalks
[1:31:47] loose we took the God took care of that
[1:31:49] on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:52] amen it's no longer
[1:31:54] that it's it's no longer children just
[1:31:59] poking here and there and speaking in
[1:32:01] tongues and and and again nothing wrong
[1:32:04] with that as long as it's in its place
[1:32:07] amen but not acting like children in
[1:32:09] order decent in order amen as mature
[1:32:13] Christians handling situations as mature
[1:32:16] Christians amen God help us God help me
[1:32:19] I certainly need help in that in that
[1:32:21] area as mature Christians
[1:32:24] so when God looks he sees a mature bride
[1:32:27] not a child anymore who knows how to
[1:32:29] handle the word remember word with
[1:32:33] Revelation is Godly amen power with
[1:32:37] character is Godly yes the word with
[1:32:40] proper with God's revelation is Godly
[1:32:44] amen and the bride will use it yes as
[1:32:46] God gives her utterance to use it right
[1:32:49] otherwise she's quiet she doesn't she's
[1:32:52] s still unless he gives her thus sayith
[1:32:55] the Lord right amen and when it's thus
[1:32:58] sayeth the Lord It's from God yes she
[1:33:01] knows how to handle the word yeah she
[1:33:03] knows how to handle be a mature
[1:33:05] Christian amen no longer a child look on
[1:33:09] the day of Pentecost I'm going to read
[1:33:11] this acts
[1:33:12] two when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:33:15] come fully come they were all with one
[1:33:18] Accord in one place when it was fully
[1:33:21] come I didn't mean it was when they
[1:33:23] first got up there right but when it was
[1:33:25] fully come that's when they got into one
[1:33:28] mind and one Accord yes and suddenly
[1:33:32] there came a sound from Heaven as of a
[1:33:34] rushing Mighty Wind there's that wave
[1:33:37] sheep again waving over why because he
[1:33:39] was the first one that came to maturity
[1:33:41] he was the first one that resurrected
[1:33:43] from the dead now he's coming back onto
[1:33:45] the believer as he promised he would do
[1:33:47] in John 14 he's coming back on the
[1:33:50] believer and as this sound comes in as
[1:33:53] as a rushing Mighty Wind it filled all

[1:34:22] little children and when the spirit come
[1:34:24] and fell in that place those children
[1:34:26] went dead
[1:34:27] silent they didn't go to sleep they
[1:34:30] didn't die but the spirit of God moved
[1:34:33] in there and even the little children
[1:34:35] felt it yes and they were quiet to where
[1:34:38] the spirit of God could move in that
[1:34:40] congregation amongst those people and
[1:34:42] have his way and every whomever was
[1:34:44] willing to receive and let the Lord move
[1:34:46] into their lives yes amen the children
[1:34:49] went quiet my wife can tell it's the
[1:34:51] truth amen they would come quiet
[1:34:54] praise the Lord because that that's
[1:34:56] that's what we
[1:34:57] want I tell you that's what I wanten
[1:35:00] Lord come and let that Spirit fill all
[1:35:02] the house yes all the house where we

[1:35:09] there appeared unto them that wave sheep
[1:35:11] was waving over them again and there
[1:35:13] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:35:16] as of fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:35:19] again the Dual Purpose
[1:35:21] here that Spirit of God came like fire
[1:35:26] and it sat upon each of them
[1:35:29] and and they were all filled with the
[1:35:33] Holy Ghost they didn't just get a
[1:35:35] mingling Saints they got a mingling and
[1:35:38] an indwelling they didn't just get an on
[1:35:41] they got an on and an in amen the Holy
[1:35:44] Spirit came down on them and anointed
[1:35:47] them yes but he also filled them with
[1:35:51] his spirit amen praise God the simple
[1:35:53] anoint anointing is not good enough a
[1:35:55] simple anointing there's people all over
[1:35:57] the world it's just Devils as they can
[1:35:59] be have an anointing CA the rain falls
[1:36:01] on the just and the unjust the scripture
[1:36:04] tells us that the rain falls on the just
[1:36:06] and the unjust so a devil's out there
[1:36:08] and speaking tongues and pencils stand
[1:36:10] up and write in unknown tongues and
[1:36:12] operate under those gifts but they're
[1:36:14] false yeah but what separates is is not
[1:36:18] only on them but it was in them praise
[1:36:21] the Lord what did that do that baked
[1:36:24] them by the Holy Ghost and Fire all
[1:36:26] together as one loaf praise the Lord
[1:36:29] Jesus today friend as a bride of Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ we're just we're one loaf we are
[1:36:35] one one member we are one person we are
[1:36:39] we are his wife amen amen the Bride of
[1:36:43] Jesus Christ his wife as one the all
[1:36:46] come together and the Holy Spirit was
[1:36:49] waved over the people again and they're
[1:36:51] all
[1:36:53] Anointed with the Holy Ghost and filled
[1:36:56] with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and
[1:37:00] they began to speak with other tongues
[1:37:02] as the spirit as the spirit gave them
[1:37:05] utterance right amen not to try to teach
[1:37:08] them but as the spirit gave them
[1:37:10] utterance I think I told you I used to
[1:37:12] have a friend in Charlotte North
[1:37:13] Carolina and uh he was part of a church
[1:37:16] that that that was that they belied
[1:37:18] speaking in tongues with initial
[1:37:19] evidence of the Holy Ghost and and he
[1:37:21] would he would literally take people and
[1:37:24] he told me one time he had one of the
[1:37:26] sales consultant ladies one of the sales
[1:37:28] agent ladies out in the parking lot and
[1:37:30] she wanted to be a Christian and he
[1:37:31] tried to
[1:37:33] do I forgot what he said just start
[1:37:36] jabbering and then before you you jabber
[1:37:39] two you know for two or three minutes
[1:37:40] and you start sounding
[1:37:42] like well probably something I shouldn't
[1:37:45] say but you start sounding you start
[1:37:47] sound like a fool you're just jabbering
[1:37:49] and jabbering because that's all it is
[1:37:51] it's just it's just Jabber blah blah
[1:37:54] blah blah blah and and and all of a
[1:37:56] sudden you've got it now that's it
[1:37:57] you've got it you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:37:59] you've been born again oh my what what
[1:38:03] what what lies of the devil amen but
[1:38:08] they believe that to be the truth yes
[1:38:11] but the word says they spake in tongues
[1:38:14] as the spirit gave them utterance not as
[1:38:16] some man tried to teach you to jabber
[1:38:19] but as the spirit gave them utterance
[1:38:22] and as the spirit gave them utterance
[1:38:24] that's when they did praise the Lord now
[1:38:27] in this last day the bride as as mature
[1:38:31] Christians learn how to harvest that and
[1:38:34] control that and to bring it forth in
[1:38:37] order in in in a in a in order in a
[1:38:40] church in service or wherever they may
[1:38:43] be don't have to be in church but what
[1:38:45] whenever the Lord gives utterance but
[1:38:48] not to be out of turn or out of order
[1:38:51] that it's made in order that which is
[1:38:53] part will be done away with that which
[1:38:55] is in part that the gifts can't major
[1:38:58] and a minor again will be put in its
[1:39:01] place praise the Lord so what if that's
[1:39:06] put in its place cuz see Satan can
[1:39:07] impersonate any gift so if it's
[1:39:10] splitting its place then then then what
[1:39:13] has the preeminence over that it's the
[1:39:16] word because Christ is the word the word
[1:39:19] has preeminence over any gift because
[1:39:22] the word is Christ amen the gift is just
[1:39:24] something that's a minor gifts God gives
[1:39:26] us to bless us and encourage us and
[1:39:28] uplift Us in things and those are
[1:39:30] wonderful amen but those are minors God
[1:39:33] give us the word to live by amen praise
[1:39:36] the Lord and it's the word that we live
[1:39:38] by it's the word that we stand by now
[1:39:41] again it was the rising of the sun it
[1:39:44] was the first corn of wheat of God's
[1:39:46] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[1:39:49] praise God God's first corn of Wheat by
[1:39:52] God's quickening power power God had
[1:39:54] quickened his life raised him up from
[1:39:56] the dead and he was the first fruit of
[1:39:57] those that slept the first fruits he was
[1:40:00] that sheep praise the Lord that's why
[1:40:04] they had to wave that sheath for it was
[1:40:07] the first one that come to maturity was
[1:40:09] waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to
[1:40:12] God believing that the rest believing
[1:40:15] that the rest would come because God
[1:40:18] made a way for the rest to come yes how
[1:40:20] did he do that on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:22] which we just just read amen he poured
[1:40:25] out his Spirit on all of them and then
[1:40:28] from there went to for whomsoever he
[1:40:31] will yes amen around the world down
[1:40:33] through history from whomever he
[1:40:36] will they were we were the ones that
[1:40:40] were to come praise the
[1:40:43] Lord it was a sign today because he was
[1:40:46] the first Son of God to come to full
[1:40:48] maturity to be in God plugged from the
[1:40:51] earth waved over the people
[1:40:54] by the quickening power
[1:40:58] Amen Let me just skip on here
[1:41:02] but this that was the reality that was
[1:41:05] the reality that first fruit now let me
[1:41:06] continue further down same message as
[1:41:09] Christ was the first to race let's look
[1:41:11] and see it this day I'm going to finish
[1:41:13] with this because that that's the place
[1:41:16] we are to be now that we're to we're in
[1:41:18] the end times friend we're living in the
[1:41:20] last days we know that there that should
[1:41:22] not be secret to anyone there's people
[1:41:25] out in the world that just heathens that
[1:41:27] know that look and say how much more
[1:41:30] Humanity can go and the way it's
[1:41:32] going as Christ was the first one to
[1:41:35] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[1:41:38] although typed in many places he was the
[1:41:41] first fruits of those that
[1:41:43] slept in the bride coming of Christ
[1:41:48] coming out of the church coming out of
[1:41:52] the church chur she's the bride the

[1:42:01] the grain the shook the church was the
[1:42:03] shook to protect it as it grew up and
[1:42:06] grew forward but as the as the bride the
[1:42:08] wheat begin to mature the shook begins
[1:42:12] to pull away and as the shook begins to
[1:42:15] pull away the wheat sits in the presence
[1:42:17] of the sun to
[1:42:18] ripen the the wheat the the chaff the
[1:42:22] shul falls off to the ground and is
[1:42:24] driven away with the winds but the wheed
[1:42:26] is taken into the Garner praise the Lord
[1:42:30] the mature wheat grain the bride is
[1:42:32] taken into the Garner the church that
[1:42:35] protected it the shove is falling off
[1:42:38] and blows away with the wind but the
[1:42:40] bride goes in the Rapture yes the bride
[1:42:44] coming of and the bride coming of Christ
[1:42:47] coming out of the church there will be a
[1:42:51] sheath waved again in the last
[1:42:55] days the first one to come to maturity
[1:42:58] when now in this day praise the Lord
[1:43:03] that God put in in place for us to
[1:43:06] recognize and see that brought a message
[1:43:10] that we could follow and understand that
[1:43:13] that first one that come to maturity was
