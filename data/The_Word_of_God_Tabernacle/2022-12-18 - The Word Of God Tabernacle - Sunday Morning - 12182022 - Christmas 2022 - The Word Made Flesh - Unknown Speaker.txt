only had one on one letter so I looked all I went all the way back home and looked all along the way and I told people if they saw them when they placed you know let me know you know I don't know how they would do that because I'm a pedestrian and I'm walking up and down the street as all those bus stops I get home there's nothing there I've come I walk back and I get to the bus stop and this is where the post office at least mail the one envelope that I have and there's money in them well there's money in one there's an IOU for the 28th to my stepson in prison and and when I got to the bus stop this young man is home in all of them well one of them is opened it's the one to Enoch and I said I'll send you some money on the 28th and he figured since there was no money in it I guess he really figured he wasn't going to open any of the rest of them ten dollars in one of them and so I went in and I rewarded him for with five dollars and I mailed my stuff at the post office and when I got when I got back to doing my step later in the evening I found a dollar in the street and this when I was in the store getting money to put the ten dollars in my for my granddaughter I wanted a new bill and the man turned around and he said well obviously I gotta get some change because the cashier didn't have a new dollar ten dollar bill so he got changed and they turned around and he gave me the 10 Bill and so I handed him he wouldn't take it and so the lord gave me ten eleven dollars that came with this so I just want to thank him and then I got twenty dollars at the um for missing core

for what the Lord reveals to Us Praise the Lord amen you may have eventually come to find it out but what a powerful what a powerful message praise the Lord amen let's down to our feet if we could and I'm going to turn into the scripture to Saint John today Saint John chapter 1. I mean sometimes I don't mind saying that sometimes when you go year after year you uh I get to the place you get to the place where Lord what would be a good Christmas message um we know the word is eternal we know that God is eternal and you keep finding out or looking long enough or expecting the Lord to speak to you and to usually give something to your heart to to let you know but you get into it you think well it's Christmas and I've spoke on that and I spoke on that and I've spoke on that we've gone that way and we've gone that way we've used that scripture and we've used that scripture amen but the Lord showed me something a little bit different today so it won't be different in so much that it won't be something that you haven't heard before but just different I guess as far as Christmas message is concerned but Saint John chapter 1 uh we'll redefer a few verses of scripture here but before we do let's just buy our heads for another word of Prayer and Lord Jesus we're so thankful father again for another beautiful day thank you for life and health and strength and thank you for this word Lord thank you God for sending your only begotten son thank you Jesus for coming into this world and giving your life shedding your blood and uh and redeeming your people back to yourself thank you Lord that we know that if you had not uh born you could not have lived if you had not lived you could not have died if you had not died you couldn't come back and give us the Holy Spirit and now live in us that it could be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in our mortal bodies in our life Lord and this time that we live and Lord just shine that light that continues to shine up our pathway let it continue to grow greater and greater Lord as the world is growing darker and darker Lord let the blessings of the Lord shine upon this congregation upon this service today right now father and anoint these lips anoint our ears and let you establish and accomplish whatever you'd have to be done Lord for this time we committed to you Lord and ask your blessings upon it now and we give you glory honor and praise for all that is said and done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen I'll read one verse in to let you be seated really the verse that I'm going to draw the tech context from for our text today the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can be seated if you'd like I mean I I did have a testimony that came back on my heart that I did want to mention I told you that the trip was good and everything went real well and it did and the Lord blessed and uh of course it's very old again got a lot of snow I sent pictures to the family I guess we were going to lunch on Wednesday Thursday we were stepping in our feet were going down about that deep so we got a good amount of snow but it stayed a little warmish so the roads stayed okay and of course we're used to that kind of thing but going back uh we're about an hour and a half drive from the airport where the job was so in going back on Friday night um you know we had to take the the interstate to get back to the hotel to get back to the hotel by the airport to leave out the next morning well most of the road coming down one Interstate was good I passed a uh a plow truck and he was just cooking along because there wasn't really anything to scrape and the road was pretty nice and I was moving along about the speed limit but then you have to get a transition onto this other what is a loop really around Minneapolis uh it's 494 I think and once I got on that and it goes and comes to a press and it kind of goes down the hill and after I got on that I was clipping along about the same and the car just started moving around if you've ever tried to driven on Ice you know what it feels like when you're going so fast that the friction of the tire is not hitting the road you just kind of not in danger but you can just feel uh you're you're not in control anymore as long as you're going straight you're okay so of course I let off the gas about that time I come over the hill and I started backing awful there was a a semi that had he was going 80 miles an hour I mean he was blasting and he was coming so fast I was looking around rearview mirror and I looked up ahead of me and it went down the hill up a little bit and up ahead there was a bunch of cars there was nobody around me which I was thankful for but I was going down the hill I looked up and there was red lights just coming on everywhere and I saw this white car and it was fishtailing and it was turning sideways and I thought oh my he's just getting ready to buy this old line of cars and uh I don't and I'm watching that while I'm watching this semi come barreling down in the lane next to me at 80. another car ahead of me gets over to try to avoid that he's only going 50 maybe I thought this this this semi is going to kill somebody because he was and I absolutely to this day I said Lord help them the white car straightened up and everything kept going the truck was able to slow down without killing all those people up there and we just kept right on going yeah everything thing just kind of slowed down a lot but everything just started flowing right after that point everything just started flowing and it flowed all that way to the hotel so I wanted to give God thanks for that because a million things could go wrong in this situation like that because every car was on the same situation I was under and if my car was floating around on the ice I knew everybody else was including that semi so it doesn't matter you got four wheel 10 wheel 12-wheel drive if you don't have a tank or a bulldozer or pipe spikes on your wheels you don't control a car on Ice you just don't so but the Lord controlled them this car one minute he was I literally he was like this and the next minute he was straight and yeah all the brake lights went away and everything just kept going and everything was in there and it was all smooth from there on they hit a few more it was a few more icy spots around but everything flowed good from there and I thank the Lord all of us of our crew uh we had three or four different Vehicles everybody made it to the hotel safe and everything was good so I wanted to give God thanks and praise for that amen so um the the message I wanted to speak on today of course the Christmas message was the word made flesh or the word was made flesh uh Jesus Christ that flesh body coming forth through as Micah just sang the instrument that God chose whose name was Mary but let's go back to the first verse and let's read the beginning at the first verse I want to read through to the 14th verse again but of course again my context for the text is taken out of the 14th verse the word was made flesh amen the word was made flesh which is the time title of our message today but verse 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God we don't know that word word is the logos that word that came that that came out of God uh the word was uh was with God and the Word was God a lot of people try to make a trinity out of this scripture as they do a couple of others but this is simply saying that God Elohim is the almighty God and from him issued forth everything that God had thought spoke imagined came forth that he desired to come forth in this logos from that logos going forth came the Earth came the sun came the moon came the uh the the night and day all of creation uh came Melchizedek that logos in that word became flesh in Jesus Christ who we know became Our Savior amen as the Kinsmen Redeemer that word was uh and the Word was uh the Word was God the same so that just that just makes him the Elohim God the same was in the beginning the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men the light the life was the light of men and the light that shines forth is that truth of the logos that light is the truth that shines forth that light brings Revelation that light brings life it's the ability to see is what it is if it's pretty that it's really very simple when you think even from the spiritual to the Natural aspect that if you walk into a dark building you can't see unless you turn on the light the light gives the ability to see Jesus Christ came God Almighty in the form of of human flesh to bring light so that humans could see by Revelation who he is who the word is amen he came forth to do that that's why that he asked his disciples who do uh men say that I am they ask him who what are they see and then he asked them what are you seeing what light is shining to you because the light Jesus Christ was shining right there the truth was there amen just like he told a pilot and pilate said what is truth you're looking truth in the eye the truth is not a statement the truth is not even presenting something in a correct a posture truth is a person and that person is Jesus Christ who was the light that brought life that brought Revelation for the ability to be able to see amen and that's very important to understand because of what the rest of it is and I thank God for the ability to be able to see right not just with these eyes but with the spiritual life through the I said that God give to be able to see who he is through the revelation of his word amen but um there was it's not all that for everybody in him was like the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe now William Branham John the Baptist were not that light but they came to bear witness of that life so that through them there might be a a word spoken that God would use in those human flesh to bring forth a revelation of light to men amen that others through them might believe he was not that light John the Baptist was not that light William Branham was not that light he was not Jesus Christ right but he was sent by God to Bear witness of that life amen amen that others through that witness might believe amen praise the Lord to Bear witness of that like that was that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came in unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God we are of God Little Children amen and the Word was made flesh praise the Lord It's Made flesh in the body of Jesus Christ dwelled Among Us and we beheld his glory the Glorious of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth but not everybody is of that truth look in Saint John 3 16 for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son the whosoever should believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life right because of that light they believed the light amen but the darkness could not comprehend the light now if you're not if you drop down to uh well let's just keep reading for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but through that but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten a Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world Jesus and Men loved Darkness rather than light the men loved the darkness because the darkness comprehended not the light they rejected the light because they light the darkness better why would that why would anybody like Darkness better than light you look at the world today and you see the darkness going on around in the world today you look at how everybody seems to enjoy your life the darkness more than the light uh it was it was strange to me when you look around and you see how prevalent it's becoming that uh through cartoons and and uh science fiction and things like that that people are starting to celebrate more the villain than they are the good guy right he used to be back in my day or back in the western day and the bad guy wore a black hat white the the good guy wore a white hat and the bad guy wore black hat I don't know is that stereotypical is that racist but people can say what they want about it but the truth is the light is Jesus it brings forth light the darkness is black is is something that the men could not comprehend because they like the darkness better than the line and even more now you see again the the bad things or the the evil things are celebrated as much or more now than the guy is right I it's just crazy to understand but it's true uh the even like Disney and stuff they have they have something I I believe uh that that kind of encapsulates all the villains that have been uh made up of all these characters in these cartoons and you celebrate the villain really I don't I don't want to celebrate a villain I don't want to celebrate Darkness right I want to celebrate life so it makes me wonder why do people like Darkness more than light well it tells us the world uh this is kind of light is coming to the world men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil their deeds were evil that's why they like Darkness more than lion because their deeds are evil if your Deeds are evil you want your deed your evil Deeds to stay hidden you want them to stay under a cover you want them to stay in darkness you want to stay in anonymity because you don't want to become known as that that's that that is evil or have evil works or evil Deeds so what do you want you want it to stay covered you want it to stay in darkness you don't want anybody to know about it you want anybody to talk about it you don't want anybody to bring it up you want it to stay in the darkness see and that's the same thing that that world because people men love Darkness rather than light because they're Deeds are evil and they want the Deeds to stay in the dark they don't want people to know that your that their deeds are evil amen and thus they like Darkness rather than light for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved if people say what an evil person they really are what an evil system it really is so they try to everything they can to keep it in the dark amen and I don't mean to get political this is a Christmas message but I believe that's one thing that the Lord allowed for Donald Trump to come become president uh whatever you think of them whatever kind of prayers he was or whatever we got now that doesn't matter that it is what it is the Lord's letting whatever happened he raised them up and he puts them down right but there's one thing I do know he shot a lot of light on a lot of Darkness amen that just the Lord allows them to do what they do and they do what they do and and we we all knew how corrupt it all was and how the system was how corrupt and evil it was but it's become more exposed nowadays and actually they don't even seem to care they're complicit in the whole thing they love Darkness amen I'm not talking about any specific person system the system is of the devil and the devil is evil amen praise the Lord and you can say that even about the church world you could say that about the nominational world and the religious system it's it's the religious system is of the devil the system came from Satan and his Darkness but people people don't mind being in a system of Darkness because they can live any way they want they can live and operate in their evil Deeds because the system doesn't expose it the system doesn't preach about Sin this system doesn't expose sinful acts and evil evil works so they like it they like Darkness rather than life people gone this morning and they're filling them up by the tens of thousands amen but Jesus Christ is light amen Jesus Christ is light to bring light to bring Revelation to bring life to men praise the Lord but he didn't do it the truth cometh to the light praise the Lord that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God amen that's the godliness that's God's people now why we see here Jesus came in flesh he came to bring light but there was a greater purpose even than or or or or or another purpose I'll say greater or lesser for the word becoming flesh God had already given us something to help us understand uh as a type or shadow of what his plan was to bring Redemption to men and it was called the Kinsmen Redeemer Jesus had to be born to come as a kinsman redeemer to become Kinfolk to us he could not come and redeem us in the state that he was in amen he could not come to redeem us in the almighty God encompassing all space Time and Eternity because we're all inhuman flesh he himself had to become in human flesh to redeem our human flesh and flesh thus Jesus had to be born to become a a a a kid's memory gamer to us praise the Lord let's go to Ruth chapter three we'll look at this just for a few moments that kinsman redeemer that he become flesh he had to be born there had to be a well I'll just say there had to be a Christmas there had to be a day amen most people celebrate December 25th we know that it wasn't December 25th that Jesus was born we celebrated as such we also know that again I'll say this as I've done the past few Christmases we also know that you look out go down the road and you see all these nativity scenes with the three wise men and their gifts giving Jesus gifts in a Manger there's no such thing happen in the scripture amen No Such Thing Shepherds came and found him in a Manger but the three wise men with the gift came Jesus was over two years old right yeah so by their Traditions they make the word of none effect right right amen because those those are incorrect if they have three wise men bringing gifts in a Manger uh in this nativity scene of them coming and giving because it's absolutely not scriptural amen right so we were we do remember that it's the tradition it's the system again but now Jesus again had to be born he had to be born Unfortunately today a lot of people a lot of people have Jesus in one or two places if at all they either have him still as a little baby in a Manger and that's what he is to them or he's some great mystical being that's out in the stratosphere somewhere that you can't feel or touch or know anything about there's some uh uh Untouchable unreachable beingness out there somewhere some mystical something see the god in in different so they can't bring Jesus into the humanity that he is that's my point into the humanities God in flesh that he was that he is and that he is in us still today it's still Jesus Christ and flesh just in you and me right but now this kinsman redeemer had to come Ruth uh chapter 3 read a few verses of scripture here for beginning with the eighth verse now we all know the story I guess we know or familiarize ourselves somewhat to the story of Ruth um where Naomi had her her husband and two sons two sons married two daughters and uh they went to Moab and the sons the husband died the the sons died excuse me and and uh it came Naomi and uh Ruth and the other daughter-in-law I forget her name now and Oprah and they were so they came to a choice because Naomi said I I have nothing here left I'm going back to my homeland and she told them that they should just go and Ruth said no I'm gonna follow you Oprah just left she just stayed Moab but Ruth said I'm gonna stay with you wherever you go I'm gonna go whatever you do I'm gonna do whoever your God is is my God Amen and she went with her and she stayed with her and it come a time where Naomi taught Ruth the lesson of the kinsman redeemer because Kinsman act the Kinsmen Redeemer actually uh I forget which part it's in but it's in Exodus I believe it's before Ruth now the kinsman redeemer was set in place even before this was just a lesson of that kinsman redeemer and she began to teach truth about what the kinsman redeemer was and the process that it went through and she told that Ruth what she was to do because this man Boaz was a nearer Kinsman if he was a good man he was a rich man he was part of the family he was a part of the uh in relation to Naomi's husband and he was a near Kinsman to them and so he she gave her instruction to go and and make yourself known to this Boaz so she does it in the fields and uh the the young man of the fields kind of take a liking to her but she she shies away from all that and uh she does exactly what Naomi tells her to do and she stays right on the the path of redemption that Naomi had described to her and we get to the eighth verse now and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid Boaz was afraid and turned himself and behold a womanly at his feet that was Ruth and he said who art thou and she's answered I am Ruth thine handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed the more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in so much as thou followest not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do now look what Boaz is telling Ruth I will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am a near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than I do you know that there was a Kinsman to them nearer than Boaz amen Terry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsmen well let him do the Kinsman part but if he will not do the Kinsmen uh the part of a Kinsmen to thee then will I do the part of a Kinsmen to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning now Boaz has given her this instruction and this promise I am going to uh redeem you I am going to play that part of Kinsmen to redeem that part that I am the Kinsman of from the lineage of Naomi's husband I'm going to play that part and I'm going to redeem all that was his and and in redeeming all that was his he got also Ruth amen she came uh with the Redemption of what belonged to Naomi's husband and Naomi of course too she he was to play that near Kinsman Park but as Boaz said there was a near Kinsman two Boaz and so Boaz goes out in the next morning and in front of everybody he tells this man uh now I I am near Kinsmen and I'm ready to do the near Kinsmen work but you are a near Kinsman than I am listen now uh I I know it gets a little confusing when you're uh jumping from uh this point to this point but listen real close because we're we're getting to this point before I uh before I finish this up Boaz goes and talks to this near Kinsman and he tells us near Kinsmen now I will play the part of Kinsmen and redeem all that was his and all that was his will become mine because I am the near Kinsman to him and redeemed that inheritance to myself and the man said I will redeem that inheritance I will take control over that inheritance and that inheritance will become mine and Boaz said that's fine but you must understand that when you redeem all that is his all that is his comes with Ruth and Naomi you've got to redo you have to redeem Ruth as well and the man said I cannot do that I cannot redeem Ruth I cannot uh it would Mar my inheritance if I were to take this woman unto myself I cannot do that I can't do it without uh without affecting my own inheritance without affecting my own life and my own home I cannot do this and Boaz says well let it be known today and of course as you know then that day they would take off their shoe and beat it on the table and say let it be known right now in front of all the townspeople that I relinquish my rights to this inheritance and to Ruth I relinquish it now listen there was in that Kinsmen work that Jesus Paid For Us you realize that when Jesus came and was born into this Earth there was a near Kinsman that had rights over us first that was the devil yes right the devil had rights to us first how why would the devil have first rights or first divs on us because it was sold out to him in the Garden of Eden right remember when Adam fell he lost his inheritance in life he lost his inheritance to the Earth and he lost his inheritance in The Book of Life now we know it could not keep the book of life it had his dirty hands could not take it it had to go back in the hands of God again marring the devil's inheritance amen it would have marred his inheritance to take that book of life unto himself because that was the book of redemption right and Satan could not redeem anything right Satan could not come and die he could not take your sin upon himself because he was sin yes amen anything that is sin cannot take sin because he is sin so he could not take on that sin without marring his inheritance so he couldn't take the book of Redemption how could he redeem well this man is the same way this near Kinsman he could not take Ruth to himself because it would have marked his inheritance it would have marred the devil's inheritance to take you unto himself because there's no way Satan could redeem Humanity without Morgan himself but when he but but when when he got controlled this Earth when he took control that's why we were born in sin shaped iniquity common World speaking lies when he took control over the world he took control of everything about the world he took control over everything that came from the earth us our bodies were not redeemed amen they could not be because we belong to our near Kinsmen right right the world and all that is therein is still in the possession of that near Kinsmen the devil right it still is to this day and he could not take inheritance to redeem that that book of life remember now brother Graham said he couldn't take it because uh his Filthy Hands couldn't take control of her and that is true he also could not take it because it was a book of redemption and what was in that book was scheduled to be redeemed back from its Fallen condition he could not do that he was following himself right amen sin cannot become sin amen sin cannot become sin because it's already sin amen this wall can't become blue it's already blue it can become a different Shadow blue but that's just Humanity fleshy worldliness but it's already blue this this uh Bible stand can't become wood it's already wood amen Satan could not become sin he already was sin and then you notice my brother random talked about a sinner can't sin right because he's already sin he is just doing what he is amen this this Bible stand can't become what it's already wood right he could not redeem because he was already sin and that's what he wanted that that was who he was so he lost the book but he gained the world he gained control over the world in all the world systems and everything that came from the world again including our bodies including us that needed Redemption we needed that Redemption we needed to have someone that could come forth to play that kinsman redeemer part to redeem this world back to himself and at the same time redeem us yes thus we have been redeemed by the love of God we have been redeemed by the blood of God now that light has come to shine its light in our pathway so that we can know who he is and what that light does foreign to us because we are because we have become him he took our place so that we could take his he became us so that we could become him that part of the near Kinsmen he played so Satan had to back away Satan had to take his hands off that's why you hear Brother banham uh sometimes on tape or something when he's standing there and he's praying for people or he's standing in front of a congregation and he says Satan take your hands off of God's Property how does he have a right to do that because of the Kinsmen Redeemer is my redeemer came and had the keys of death and hell and the keys of of heaven and he gave it to the bride amen it was of course in the scriptures to Peter but that's Peter was just a part of us the bride could be redeemed and that Redemption brought us back into life again Jesus had to come in human flesh to play the part of that kinsman redeemer Satan could not do it amen amen God became flesh to redeem his inheritance what was his inheritance we are yes we are the ones whose names were in that book of life from before the foundation of the world that was his possession that was his inheritance we're a part of that inheritance God has blessed us to know that that inheritance belongs to us now we the children of God like light more than Darkness why because we've been redeemed we've been changed Jesus Christ came and redeemed us back to him so that we can enjoy the light the life of God through the revelation of the word to bring us into his presence again amen amen Satan could not do it and Satan tries to redeem us friend it would have marked his inheritance and what is his Satan's inheritance the darkness yes the darkness is his inheritance the light is our inheritance and God has redeemed us and brought us back to himself made us like him so that we now can stand in that light we can stand in the place that God has given us by the Redemption of of of the blood of Jesus Christ he had to come we think about it and sometimes you wonder why would God have to have done this we had to do it because that was by his word see God can't do anything outside of his word God can't do anything separate you think well God just come down and snap his finger and the devil would despair yeah but that wouldn't be according to his word that wouldn't be just you think it wouldn't be just for God to just snap the devil out of existence no no he gives everybody amen Angel beings humans every God is a just God God is a fair God you say well God's a god of judgment yes he is but he's a god a fair judgment he's a fair God when he judges he doesn't judge on emotion you know so many times decisions we make and snap things that we do it's already a lot of it's on emotion right we see something or a snap decision or or or or knee-jerk reaction as they would call it that that's Humanity that's how people are God doesn't do that God is a righteous God God is a holy God and everything he does is righteous and holy even his judgments so yeah he's a god of judgment but he judges righteously and Satan will be judged Lucifer the devil the red dragon will be judged and he'll be just according to his deeds yes by the scripture amen just like everybody will so no God would not be a just God if he just snapped his finger in the devil went out of existence he would not but he has to go through and play his part just like everybody does yes amen just like that sermon I preached what maybe a couple years ago and people keep coming up and I still hear people say that people who don't know and people out in the world say oh that person's in hell that's that's how you know that well it was just a horrible person was that based on your judgment or on God's judgment right well they were just a horrible person what might what makes you such a good person well they they were just they were so much worse than I am I said what is worse is it in your eyes that something is worse or is it in God's eyes that something is worse well I just know that person's in Hell well let me tell you there's nobody in hell right now right right amen God doesn't send us anybody to Hell Without first being judged because he's a righteous God nobody's in hell right now there will be there are people in the regions of the Lost amen there are people in the regions of the blessed and people in regions of the lost but I'm not in hell right they will be one day uh many will be but they're not right now because that would be an unjust God has to bring them before the Judgment seat before they before there is a sentence it's supposed to be that way today amen and and I and the fathers the founding fathers that's where they brought that from the scripture innocent till proven guilty now in a lot of cases in the world today it's not that way you're guilty as Sin regardless but that's a person's opinion that's why I'd say it I'd ask somebody uh how do you know that person's in the hill is it based on your judgment are you the one that's in control that's in control of Health you open up the carpets of hell and you throw somebody in there is that your is that your job is that what you're supposed to do is that why you're in charge of well you know and but uh it just gets people to thinking to understand because we becomes a judgmental we put somebody in hell to drop a hat you look at it and think well I don't I've done worse you know um something was told to me yesterday that uh and I don't want to call him names or anything I don't want to embarrass anybody but it was uh it was about uh one of the children messing up a floor and I thought about that I thought wow that's man that's just terrible at all and I thought you know when I was a kid and I'll I can tell you my name and I'll be honest with you about me but when I was a kid my dad worked for a company called eh Jacobs and they gave these little Knives Out uh it's just a little fold thing and plastic in in it but it was a very sharp razor blade there's you know that was in the 70s who wouldn't do that today uh but uh that just razor blades are all over the place and I got a hold of one and you know I was just having fun with it and I started carving into the linoleum in the den of our men of our house carving my initials and so I look at that and think well kid may have done something wrong but I can't condemn him for it I did the same thing Bobby maybe even worse so when you look at it but you understand my point my point is we look and say well that's so horrible that person deserves this well you will it might not include chopping off the floor but it's probably something else maybe as bad or just or as bad or worse if we're just thinking but when we but we've got to be careful because the Judgment that we're laying on other people we got to understand that judgment will come right back to us again yeah amen if I want to be met on that standard then that's the standard I'm going to have to be met on that's why I like what Jesus said blessed are the merciful or they shall obtain mercy so if you want Mercy give it yeah if you want God to extend his Mercy to you you extend Mercy to others that's how you get it not judgment not sending them to hell not condemning somebody at the drop of a hat no but see God doesn't do that God is a righteous God he's a just God he doesn't do that even to the devil so today we know and live and thankful how God has given us this uh this ability through sending his own son Jesus Christ as a human in in flesh body it's way more than just presence it's way more than a tree and you know how I feel about that but there it's way more than likes it's way more than parades it's way more than uh uh all the Pomp and Circumstances surrounds it I'll be honest with you uh you know when when November hits I become a Happy Fella because I enjoyed Thanksgiving very much I enjoy the holiday season even um and a lot of things that go with it there's a lot of stuff I don't enjoy about it but my wife was telling me yesterday I'm so getting tired of Christmas music and I said well I haven't even heard any I when you're on the job in the tunnel at the car wash it was there's no Christmas music you might go to a restaurant for a few minutes and go back to your room and door Dash something or before you can pass out in bed there's not a whole lot of listening to Christmas music there is but I enjoy it I do honestly I do uh stuff about it I wish didn't exist but I enjoy the time especially in Tucson because the temperature drops about 20 degrees 30 degrees but I enjoy it I do and I enjoy the opportunity to be able to celebrate and celebrate with you and to celebrate with my family and enjoy that time it's a nice time so amen but Jesus are near Kinsmen are near

he has always been yes Lord let's stand if we could foreign amen Our Redeemer redeemed us back to himself amen praise the Lord so thankful if you weren't for that friends every one of us would be lost but he did it he didn't have to do it but he wanted to do it he was the only one that could do it no man ever born could take that book remember when John saw it John started crying John started weeping because he thought all of humanity was lost because he looked at that book of redemption knowing that his name was in there amen a lot of people thought that he was crying because he didn't see his name no he knew his name was in there he was crying because he was afraid that it was nobody that was going to be worthy to take that book and to redeem all the names that were in there and step forth Jesus Christ the Lamb of God to take that book amen and play that part of the kinsman redeemer amen Satan lost it into the hands of God Jesus came and took it and said I redeem all of these people I redeem the entire inheritance of the earth and everything that's in it and in redeeming all this Earth and everything about it back he redeemed all of you back too amen praise the Lord that's
