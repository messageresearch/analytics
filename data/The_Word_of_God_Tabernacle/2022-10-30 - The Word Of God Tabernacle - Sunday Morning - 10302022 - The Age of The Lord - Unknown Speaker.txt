praise the Lord yes he hears them better the spot's gone Satan's been trying to mess with his head here and give him that migraines if you ever had a migraine and he had that spot in his eye when he was here at church earlier and I prayed for him sitting over there and just trusting the Lord but the spot's gone and Victory Is Ours Victory as he is goes greater is he that is in US amen praise the Lord Jesus so we want to remember Mike in prayer amen for those who may know I woke up Monday morning and I was in um um feeling pretty pretty bad a lot of congestion sore throat uh I think I just may have overdid it over the weekend and with my voice Sunday and then sat under the air conditioner all night Sunday night and Monday morning and woke up and I guess it just got the best of me so I've been kind of under the weather all week the bike's still even here at a little bit but I'm so much better thank God for that I really didn't have a fever maybe just a tick of a fever during the week but you know when you can't breathe and that stuff's in your lungs and your head and just the oxygen and you try to rest and get rid of that stuff and it just it just uh um that sometimes that devil just hard to get out of there so but thank God he's uh for the touch of the Lord I appreciate that he's trying to get on my wife now so appreciate your prayers for her the Lord would just touch her too and have an unspoken request I bless you good to see sister Pat back with us let's stand to our feet if we could and then ask brother Dennis if you would you take these knees to us to the Lord's birthday Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads and Unison of the faith yes knowing the Lord You're mindful of each and every Oneness thank you and it's here is over the stringing father and we know that we serve a living God yes Lord God did all things thank you Jesus thank you Father first of all cleanse Our Hearts by your blood and you says if we confess our sins you are faithful and just forgive us of your sins and cleanse us from all thank you righteousness and Lord we are needy people and father we know the enemy is fighting harder than he's ever fought the believer before and we know in ourselves we are going to be defeated but as our Pastor said several times greater is he that's in US yes in the world Amen and Lord there's such a spirit that's going on so strong I've never seen it so pronounced even such a catastrophe that took place in Korea the celebration of Halloween oh father it's a devil's holiday it's nothing to do with the believer and father I recognizes I read your word this morning you need to give us there shall discernment yes you know what's right and what's wrong as Believers can be caught up with the things of the world our identity could be with uh Satan and then the world that he controls and not realizes if you're not working in us and have come pleat preeminence and control we are going to fail you Lord we are going to miss the Mark it's time to check up and take inventory every day to know that Lord we don't want to serve again and be a part of the world and the things of the world in a part of Satan's kingdom we are of your kingdom we have to be identified and recognize that's true thank you standing in a fresh carcass of the revealed word of God for this hour and father we are needy we know this is too shall agree it's touching anything it shall come to pass and Lord there are many needs there's several that need a healing touch you are mindful of each other thank you you are a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed we call them you want to sing to touch each and every one there might be some that's even not feeling good in church this morning Father just give them that touch yes [Music] their hearts desire and father all the other requests you know what uh they have need of and especially as they raise their hands Lord you know our hearts better than what we even know of ourselves may you just grant them their harsh desire you said delight yourself in the Lord and you'll give us the desires of our hearts oh lord it's not time to play church I heard your Prophet as I was driving to church he was talking about their wives and foolish virgins we can do things right that we know and and thinking that we're doing good and father it is the prophet said These Foolish virgins came and sought for that oil the Holy Spirit and the bride was gone they missed the mark they were left behind oh Father oh let us totally consecrate our lives do you let us be written up yes of all men that people can take hold and like the book of Acts the apostles that that people notice they have been with Jesus yes Lord bless our pastors the neighbors Faithfully knowing he hasn't been feeling good Lord touch him give him the strength to deliver what you put on his heart and give us our hearts open and sensitive and ready to receive your word this morning yes [Music] the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you could be seated amen praise the lord we have some praise reports here amen you heard my praise report thank God appreciate him for touching and healing me and I always forget I believe right after church today remember us we're going to Phoenix my flight goes out of Phoenix this time then Sonia is going to take me to Phoenix and fly out so we're gonna be leaving here pretty quickly after service today but um I had written down in the praise report here um that brother Pat put down for his son Joseph he had a double hernia operation uh Thursday and came through uh with flying colors brother Pat called me and said they were on his their way to the hospital to visit him and called him and he was out of the hospital and on his way to Orange Grove to get something to eat so I love Gardens amen what's that Olive Garden oh that's not an orange girl but Olive Garden is nevertheless amen so praise the Lord praise the Lord so God I heard a prayer and answered answer the request amen so thank God for that also I want to thank the Lord for 50 years ago tomorrow the Lord sent my wife to the United States and he sent her here just for me so all of y'all think you got a part over that's okay you can have her for a while but she belongs to me and so I thank God for that 50 years uh it's hard to believe but 50 years ago tomorrow amen I'm sorry I won't be here to celebrate her anniversary I usually take her to get some Mexican food on uh Halloween night on the 31st uh hard to hate October 31st when such a wonderful thing in my life happened so but um appreciate the Lord bringing my wife to this country to me Amen to this city for us to be together so amen so I that is a definite praise report for me so thank God for that one more song before we change the of the service now amen it's number 15 in the Burgundy book if you want to go there it'll be on the screen too amen phone number 15. show the presence of the Lord amen I believe he's here I believe he's here amen he said he'd never leave us or forsake us but we expect him to manifest himself make himself known a powerful way today and super natural way man praise the Lord let's sing it now surely the presence of the Lord is in this place [Music] I see glory on each face surely the presence of the Lord is in this place amen yes surely the presence of the Lord is in this place [Music] surely the presence from the Lord is in this place over time now [Music] yes surely the presence of the Lord is in his place [Music] I [Music] see Glory don't need space surely love presence of the Lord is in this place [Music] amen praise the Lord Jesus Hallelujah you know we don't believe he's here because we can feel him we believe him here he's here because of faith and his word said he would be but oh doesn't it feel good when you just feel the power of God moving through you amen sweeping through the place amen we know he's here that's regardless but oh it feels so good just to feel the presence of God Amen and know that he is real know that we're doing something that is pleasing to him that he would come and visit us once again today praise the Lord Jesus amen so wonderful isn't it amen praise the Lord God is so good to us I mean let's change what the service now amen stand to our feet now we'll go right to the scripture and we're gonna as I do every week start beginning to think about what the Lord would have because you know when you're on a series like we've been on with the new beginning it uh um it kind of almost becomes default but the next service is going to be that but I don't treat it that way I honestly don't because I don't want to just fall into a Rudder routine that that's just going to be it I want to find the mind of the Lord yes and last week and if it's something that's different or something that's out of the routine if you will that the Lord wants and last week he put on my heart something that I believe he wanted me to bring today and in And in regards to the season that we're facing and what's going on around us and of course the holiday that the country celebrates tomorrow uh I felt led to bring this today so let's turn to job uh we're gonna go to Job chapter 1. so we're going to change it a little bit today with the Lord Jameson uh today so maybe if the Lord willing that the next week will get back up to where we are uh with the new beginning in the Millennium so might that be the little will of the Lord and we'll pursue with that but this week we're going to touch on this call this message the angel of the Lord names of the Lord and I will be uh just blunt with you obviously I've got nothing to hide but the first thing that came on my mind was uh was spirits and speaking on Spirits which sometimes I do around Halloween around this time and and not just Halloween friend but also we get into the Christmas uh time and things as demonic spirits that just swirl continuously around us and I woke up the other day and the Lord put a song on my heart and I was coming to church and you know to study and all and I thought I thought Lord did you put this on my heart to change my thought uh to not necessarily speak on the Demonic or evil spirits and I felt the Lord changed it to put it in the other direction so we're going to talk about the angel of the Lord we're going to talk about uh the spirits of God Amen Holy Spirits not the demonic spirits some much amen so we're going to go to job chapter 1. we can begin with verse six but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Precious Jesus father we're so thankful Lord that you give us something to uh to stand on Lord and for us in your word God for you to reveal to us and show us the hour and the day that we're living Lord and and of course to encourage us and strengthen us along our ways God it's a journey that we take God that we've dedicated consecrated to you and believing your presence to be here knowing that your spirit is living within us and that God could do the exceeding abundantly even now in this service Lord above all that we could ever ask or think Lord we just pray once again that this word would come forth yes Empower and manifestation you the word itself says that by the preaching of the word comes faith faith to increase by the preaching of this word comes healing and we believe that healing comes forth Lord from your word because it's all by faith we Believe We Believe today God that your hand is upon us and you're going to bring us and Deliver us into higher Heights and deeper depths of your word and your spirit so God I pray take complete control over me Lord over each one of us over this service and the remaining part of it and let it be according to what your purpose would be for it now as we commit it to you we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here today we thank you for it Lord and to you be the glory and honor and Lord may God we not leave here but what you've done of work in each of Our Lives God and by faith we believe now standing upon that word so granted here is we delve into this word once again Lord one more time here in this service now today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Job chapter 1 verse 6. excuse me now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and turneth from a shoe of evil turneth aside from Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said the job fear God for not hath not Thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord you could be seated if you'd like going to talk about job just a little bit but I want to go over to Psalms and couple this scripture reading with Psalms chapter 24 a 34 excuse me Psalms chapter 34. amen Psalms chapter 34 we'll come back to job in a minute if you want to keep your place there so much in job to talk about but again I want to couple that scripture with Psalms 34. we'll begin with verse 1. Psalms 34 1. David says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together assault the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto me uh they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the Lord encamped the round about them that fear Him and delivereth them amen the angel of the Lord which is our service title again this morning the angel of the Lord look at David's exclamation here the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear Him and delivereth them and delivereth them we don't want to forget that part A lot of times we talk about the angels of the Lord and camping about those that fear him but we don't want to forget the part where it says he delivers us also he's not just around us but delivereth Us Praise the Lord so the angel of the Lord encamped the encampeth around about them that love him now or is it fear him which is a reverence which is a love but now let's go back to job and look at this for a moment because Satan made a proclamation to God a very important Proclamation in the 10th verse that job that that Satan said to God that job serves you for a reason God came up and told Satan that job was perfect he was upright uh perfect means he was morally and ethically pure he was a mature adult he was of complete age upright means he was pleasing to God and did everything correctly in the eyes of God Amen and this was before the blood of Jesus Christ was ever shed and the Holy Spirit come down on God's people job lived in that state in that at that time but then Satan come back and said but God job serves you for a reason there's a reason job doesn't just serve you and see that's the same attitude Satan has about all of us today Satan believes that you only serve God because God does stuff for you or because God has given you something or God this that and the other and there's a reason why we serve God friend there is no if you are a true holy ghost-filled son or daughter of God there is only one reason that you serve the Lord Jesus and that's because you love it period there is no other reason it didn't cause he healed you it didn't cause he saved your family and in because you grew up that way it is because of a great Church of the movie The Spirit of filling on your flesh you serve the Lord Jesus for one reason that's because you love it Amen period That's the only reason but Satan can't understand he can't seem to grab the grass fathom even being God's right human he just can't seem to understand that there's a people that serve God and that love God and that dedicate and consecrate their lives to him based solely on the fact that we have faith in him that he exists and we love him based on the emotion the feeling the the spirit of God that's in us to love him with we love the Lord and he can't understand that and when he told God that very same thing about Joe job doesn't serve you for no reason God God job doesn't just serve you you've been good to joke look what he said again let's read it God that job doesn't serve you for no reason Doug doesn't serve you for not they'll put a hedge about him first amen amen a hedge is a barrier yes amen what kind of berry you think God puts around his children amen well I think we just read it David had a revelation of it amen Ames the Lord and camps around about those that feared him that love him praise the Lord God puts a hedge about each one of us God has a hedge around each of you God has a hedge around this place God has a hedge around his people what is that hedge that Hedges those angels of God that are here in protection over anything that Satan would try to do right that hedge is impenetrable unless God allows it for some reason just like God allowed here you say well Satan sometimes is this and you aren't feeling good this week and blah blah blah and Satan always makes excuses but there's a reason for everything God does we may not always understand it in fact probably a lot of times we don't understand God's ways but he has a reason he has a purpose and we've come to know God and to trust him enough to realize that whatever that purpose is it's going to work together for my good right so as hard as it is sometimes and it's frustrating or maybe even angry we may get God has a reason there's a purpose but that hedge now that's the first thing Satan is telling God now say job serves you first of all because you've got to protected all these angels around I can't even get to him because of the heads that you've got around him this barrier that you put up around job I can't get through that barrier how am I supposed to touch job when there's no way to get through the barrier amen aren't you glad that barrier still exists today that barrier is still just as real today because remember Revelation 12 Satan drew a third of the angels of the stars of heaven and were cast down upon the Earth but there were two-thirds do your math right if you got three thirds and you take one-thirds you got two-thirds left so there's twice as many that are with us that is with them yes because there's one third that was cast out that means there's two-thirds with God's children yes and there's one third that Encompass the entire from the billions of people but there's two-thirds that are in protection of our sweet little bride thank you amen she's not in the billions friend praise the Lord I think I did the math one time if we had two million Holy Ghost filled God-fearing Christians today that would be 200 Angels per person based on the scripture amen too high I think it's no maybe it was four I forget I lose the math but it's several hundred let's just put it that way of the angels of God assigned to each person that could theoretically I'm not saying they are we all have our own Angel of the Lord and the angel of God that's in Camp around about us we have that protection so I'm not saying that there are that many assigned to everyone but there absolutely could be by mathematics hundreds up to 400 Angels each person with you personally not the entire bride because remember there's two hundred thousand thousand demons loosed in Revelation 16 I believe it's 16. that's by the Riverview Euphrates those two hundred thousand thousand demons that means four that's two million or 200 million I forget my math now that means there's twice of those that are Holy Angels that are in protection of God's people if there's two hundred thousand thousand there's four hundred thousand thousand angels in protection of God's little bride well if you break that down friend that's that that's quite a protection right right that's quite a hedge that God keeps around his children amen but now look again God Satan says you've got this hedge I cannot touch him that hedge is impenetrable I can't touch him can't get to him and that's the reason he serves you maybe you just letting Ned grubby paws at him and I'll make him curse you to your face amen and and what else have you done for him God you you've not only has Tim you've had his house and you hedged all that he has on every side every child his wife every building every animal every servant everything that belongs in the possession or the household of of job you have hedge not just job but all that is his oh friends don't you understand what I'm saying today all that is his is hedged all that is yours if you just with the Edge by the protection of God's holy angels if we just believe not just us but all that we have all of our household everything that belongs to us is hedged by God's angels protected amen amen and Satan admitted I can't get to him can't touch it you got him hedged you got all that he has has you blessed the work of his hands and his substances increased well no wonder he serves you God you've blessed him you've increased his hand well God could have come back to Satan and said well you know why I'm doing that because he's perfect and upright before me amen he gets rewarded for being such a a Godly individual I bless him because He blesses me it's a it's a communion that we have with each other it's not a one-way Street we do it God gives and we give back and we love him and he loves us and he loves us loves us unconditionally we try in our Humanity to love him back unconditionally but this has that keeps us protected is always with us amen never leaves when Jesus said I'll never leave you or forsake you that means that everything that is his remember in Genesis 18 when God was speaking to Abraham and God spoke to Abraham and he said I will go now to Sodom to see if it's as wicked as it's been reported but did God himself Elohim standing there eating fellowshipping with Abraham did he in that Corporal body literally go down to Sodom no he sent his two angels right he sent his two angels to go down there and spout the land on his behalf but God said I will go so that's just them two going was just as good as him being there himself praise the Lord amen so if it's if it's the hands of God even if it's God's angels it's just as good as him being there oh think of it friend if that's if if that's what God has done for each of us see and and the hard part is that we live so much on the CK spell smelling here we live so much on the conscience and Imagination reason affection memory we live so much on that on that flesh and that spirit and rightfully so by our eyes you don't see them all around you you don't touch them you can't feel them you you are they there are they not well the same faith that you believe that God is here it's the same Faith to know that God's honor of his word that the angel of the Lord encamped around those that fear Him yeah and we've got scriptural precedent to know that God does that how many times you say well this is happening and that's happening uh not feeling good here seek here or accident here or whatever but who knows but what those things that God does keeps us from other greater things that could have happened in our lives or that those are minor compared to some of the things that could happen if if if the Lord allowed how much worse could it be how much worse could it have gotten amen there's been a lot of people get sick over the past couple years and never recover right yeah praise the Lord I didn't have covet but uh but there's a lot of people have gotten sick and did not recover thank God that you know it could have been worse there's been a lot of people in car accidents who didn't walk away from them amen cars banged up maybe total just a car amen God's provision will take care of the rest we just trust the Lord is there a reason God has a reason for everything but his angels are there and camped around about us to keep us yes and to protect us I believe that's why David talked about that worship when he talked about it because you notice when he entered into that scripture writing he entered it in by saying that we worship God and we lift God up and we join together in Praise of the Lord that's he said that before he talked about the aims of the Lord in camping around about us remember God inhabits the Praises of his children he inhabits the Praises of his people that is something that is very pleasing to him so much amen that he joins in that Holy Angel band that comes just like they were when Paul and Silas were in the innermost prison praise God the Holy Angel man was surrounding him there even in that prison and as the walls begin to shake and the doors begin to come open the jailers were set free just from the mere fact that Paul and Silas decided they were going to worship God amen amen amen they worshiped God God came on the scene and look what took place even so much that the Jailer himself and all his house was saved right peace praise the Lord that's the work of God as your angels of the Lord being around us constantly we're battling the experience for instance these Spirits are all around us all the time and they seem to become even more prevalent around this time of year to where even I'm gonna I'm gonna use this so hope nobody's offended even Christians celebrate this demonic time and I just I don't understand it but it's not mine to do but they become more prevalent it seems they're an experience and you feel that press right that pressing of those Spirits I read an article the other day maybe it was yesterday where some young man was out in front he was promoting a a conservative speech on a man that was going to speak at this uh University which have become Havens for not such good stuff but anyway uh and and he was out and he was he was trying to sort of promote this man who is going to give a speech on what is a woman uh because a lot of people today don't seem to understand what a woman is anymore or man for that matter so he was standing there reading the Bible he was just reading scripture he had a microphone he was quoting scripture quotes and the demonic spirits around there became so wild and so angry that people ran up and grabbed the Bible out of his hand ripped the pages out and started eating the pages of the Bible wow I mean that's just animalistic friend yes yes just acting I I can't imagine what the scene looked like but started eating the pages out of the Bible that they had stole out of this young man's hand just trying just peacefully trying to do something normally peacefully just reading the scripture anybody don't want to listen you can pass right on by and go on about your life but Devils don't do that amen it hates them and they and he hates it so bad he hates you because he knows that's what defeats him right he knows it's the scripture that defeats him not your balled up fist not a kick but the word the word is what defeats him and he hates it that's what we're facing today with these demonic spirits friend is becoming such an oppressant spirit it's becoming such a a demonic time that we need to continue to remember of all that's going on around us greater is he that is in me we're going to eat of this in the world yes the angels of the Lord are encamped around about us that protect us that keep us safe and that take care of us if there was a hedge around job that came that kept Satan and all of his minions from touching job then what do you think that we have for us that God has for his children today right amen today look at them let me read a couple other scriptures Saint Luke Chapter uh chapter 2. now remember just as God with job took down that hedge for Satan at Satan's behest because he knew that job was going to serve him anyway right he knew he was going to and even as he took that hedge down s the truth but remember those that hedge those demons those uh excuse me those angels those Holy Angels those God the Angels those are God's behest just as the aim just as the uh the the angels that Satan has they they do what's ever the devil tells them God's angels are at his beckoning call they operate these angels operate at God's pleasure you go read you see that a lot in Revelation where God moves these angels to do certain things certain places certain times go do this go Mark these uh Isaiah go Mark these that are signing crying go to the four corners of the Earth take this Inkwell and go do this and see these angels operate at the behest of God's pleasure wherever God sends them whatever God tells them to do that's what they do and on this great day here they were they were sent to do something special Saint Luke Chapter 2 verse 8 Saint Luke 2 8 and there was in the same country that might sound like a Christmas story and I guess it's read a lot around Christmas but and there was in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by nights and lo the angel of the Lord praise the Lord there he is again Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord shall round about them and they were so afraid the Angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel listen now suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will towards men now what was what was this host that this scripture is talking about it it's not the same because the translation from the Greek to the Hebrew but if you go look at the definitions you'll see that this host in a lot of ways is the same hedge that job had around him this Host this host is a band of the soldiers of Heaven that were there at that time surrounding about as the angel of the Lord was there this host from heaven was there and had them surrounded about praise the Lord worshiping God giving God praise and glory this host of Heaven had come down and had visited them and was with them at that place at the behest of God at God's instructions now let's look at another time that God did the same thing second Kings chapter um chapter six let's go to Second Kings chapter six laughs II Kings chapter six it's very familiar scripture to most of us I'm sure second Kings chapter six we'll begin reading at verse 13. amen look now and he said the king said go and spy where he Elisha is that I may sin and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore sin Heath thither horses chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the sermon of the man of God gehaza was risen early and gone forth behold and host come past the city both with horses and chariots now look the enemy hasn't surrounded the enemy of God the enemy of Elisha this King that wants to take Elisha with him has his horses and chariots compassing the entire city to where there would be no Escape and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he Elisha answered fear not oh listen to this friends I love this part fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen amen praise the Lord you can always say that friend because that is always true yes it is always true that more with us than is with them remember we've already found them scripturally there's twice as many with us that are with him there's twice as many that are protecting this little bride which is a small number compared to those that are of the evil spirits that are commanding all the rest of the souls around the world billions of people yes amen more with us than there are with them but see this poor little guy this little servant gehaza he didn't know that he was only exclaiming what he could see he was only talking to Elijah about what he could actually see around him but Master they have us all surrounded what are we gonna do now he said oh it's okay because there's more with us than there are with him you imagine him sentencing one two there's more with us there's two of us and there's more with us than there are with them look out there don't you see Elisha they're all over the mountain they're all around us they've got us surrounded there's two of us what do you mean there's more with us than they're all with them and then and then Elisha says Elisha prayed it said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see spiritual opening he meant a spiritual open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elijah praise God could you imagine you imagine something like that happening I imagine maybe to some degree the scales that fall off your eyes from time to time and maybe you've seen something like that or an angel of the Lord or something I have uh it's quite an experience it's not a it's kind of like Billy I like the way Billy Paul told it when his dad uh asked change the Lord is it okay that uh Billy sees he said okay he said he went over there and he put a pillow over his face and he woke him up because he didn't want to see him right away because it can be quite startling if you've ever seen it it can be quite startling and he had a pillow of his face he woke him up and said now he's standing over in the corner and he said I gave me permission for you to see him he's Billy Paul said he got up and under the pill and he looked he said he was standing there I'll agree with his arms crossed like this and he and just in awe he just stood and that's that's exactly to me that's exactly what it is you know oh look oh wow there's that no no no no no it's not a son of that he's standing there okay kind of takes your breath away and all of a sudden we vaporize that's not what it is but it's probably the best way of saying it and then he goes and goes away and he's out the and he's gone and the presence that's left there is just it's just incredibly awe-inspiring but you imagine just that angel Lord that stand down that was assigned to brother Branham at that time let me read you something here that was with him all the time that same age of the Lord amen listen in the questions and answers 1964. question was explain about each person's Angel who abides with them from birth uh now if you notice she said this is pretty deep I pick it up now he said part of it wrote in tight and other pencil now there is an angel look at this is really incredible to me there is an angel but this Angel of the Lord that are encamped about those that fear Him see now it isn't promised to Sinners that has Angels right not promised to Sinners it's only the redeemed that has Angels yes yes amen only the redeemed that has Angels did you know that the angels of the Lord encamped about those that fear Him Now angels are messengers I want you to notice it's so perfect and I'll prove predestination to you which we've already gone through but now when a little baby is being formed under the mother's heart and you little children that understand these things see little she's trying to explain it to the little children to understand formed under the mother's heart see the Lord gives you to mother amen the Lord gives you to mother and she carries you under her heart because you're close to her heart and then one day the Lord come down and deliver you from your mother's heart from away from her heart but you'll always be in her heart amen that that presence of that angel and he goes on to talk about how that angel is there waiting for that bird to come forth and it's with that person all their lives and that person that angel that was there with brother Branham he allowed his son to see that angel because he worked so close of course with his dad and all the Miracles and things that happened and he saw that angel of the Lord that had been there with him and he it grips you to understand what goes on when when gehaza when God opened his eyes and he saw these Chariots of Fire horses and Chariots of Fire all around he could recognize yes there are more with us than there are with them amen amen but there was no great huge battle ensued friends there was no great Showdown right there where they locked horns and swords and fought to the death they just came down and Elisha just said blind the Lord now he opened spiritually the eyes of gehaza by the prayer of Elisha and he closed physically the eyes of these men who come to take Elisha away blind them Lord and those men come in there and and Elisha lies to him just true he tells them oh I'm not him but I can show you where he is come follow me and he takes them all the way down to another city he takes them all the way down into this other city and he said he's the one they're looking for but they can't see him if they can't know who he is because God blinded their eyes and he takes them into a whole other city and he says Lord open their eyes and they're looking around and they're in the middle of this whole other city and what's going on what just happened but God but in Elijah pray said God should we should I slay them should I just kill them no give them bread and water and send them back to their Master amen it was no great battle ensue he gave him bread water fed him sent him back off to their master of course they went back and told the master and uh any normal rational uh common thinking man would say okay I don't want nothing to do with that guy uh we'll just let him stay uh we'll just be who we are just leave things alone but those angels that were there they encamped around about see they don't leave you think well they were there for that occasion you know they're there and that angel that God has that's with you my dad oh this is going to sound bad but my dad was a problem he wasn't ashamed of it because he when he was a little boy he always knew there was an angel with him amen amen I can't say that my son could at the times the pain so Lord helped him but my dad knew when he was a little boy there was an angel with him he called him Spike I that sounds crude I know but he didn't know he's just a little boy he named his Angel Spike and his whole life he would become a Christian and and he got the Holy Ghost he still called his Angel Spike but that angel that follows all the way through life she's unbelievers they're not promised that but the but the believer is promised that see they don't leave friend God has his angels his protection Brigade his hedge continuously around you yes I pray that all the time for you as a conversation as each one of us as a congregation that God keep his hands around us protected from all the things that goes on around the world today and the germs diseases afflictions and all the stuff that's happening around the evil spirits The Wiles of the devil keep them protected Lord keep those Holy Angels around with flaming swords drunk that when that demon tries to penetrate that he'll walk away amen is that Vagabond you did an Acts he walks right away from those angels wounded because those angels are there to protect you to keep you to watch over you during this period of time when all these things are going to understand Saints and these demons are real Spirits are real amen they don't just go away that we talk about the Holy Angels these ain't these these Spirits they're they're real they Spirits don't die we know they don't die right look let's let's let me read this I was going to skip over this but let me read this I got one more scripture we'll close here after this and in Matthew chapter 8 I like this scripture let's go to Matthew chapter eight we'll begin reading it the verse 28. but but I like this scripture I know uh I believe Mark and Luke had the same story they tell a little bit differently and they put a little more verbage of Jesus in it but Matthew tells it my favorite way so I read Matthew's account of it when he's coming across to the country of the gurga scenes however that's pronounced uh a fantastic thing happens to help us kind of understand the spirit world and what goes on the spirit world and understand these Spirits don't die remember when brother Noel was here he kind of I didn't print it but he kind of gave that uh that's that quote of when brother Branham was talking about uh this person has this and this person over here has that same thing and and in the presence of God these two demonic spirits that have these people bound down they're starting to scream out at each other saying what are we going to do how are we going to keep from going because they were afraid of what was about to happen and friend these demonic spirits should be shaking in their booths every single time your eyes open in the morning they should be afraid and scared every single breath you draw every time your heart beats those devils are trembling because you're a child of God yes you are the worst thing that they have ever tried to come against yes because they know that you are impenetrable God has a hedge first and greater is he that's in US amen job could not say that greater was not in job at that time but now him in US is greater now than that then that is in the world yeah yeah praise the Lord they're scared I I'm sure if you could just Lord let me tap into a conversation between the devil and one of his minions just one time and Satan says go to sister so and so go to brother sauce I was just there Satan go again and do this I tried it it didn't work but do it again well the last time you you remember that big gash I had in me that came from her you know that that's a a leg that was broke that was him I don't want to go back over there and get beat up again I said go that demon goes but he comes back to that brother that sister and walks away just as wounded maybe a gash in the skull this time I know I'm talking naturally friend on a spiritual warfare but you understand what I'm saying yeah yeah that demon will go back to Satan C I told you devil I don't want to go back over to her again wounded naked because of a son or daughter of God that by faith caring and wielding this sword defeats that enemy every time praise God look at this in Matthew 8 28 and when he come to the other side into the country of the gurga scene there met him too possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man might pass that way now these are some pretty rough devils nobody would even go buy them just for their presence being there the same thing happened today for instance people that and you know what you better not confront any of those Spirits unless you know where you stand with the Lord that you don't that's not something that you play with amen bye-bye and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus now look Jesus according to Matthew's account which I told you I like his account better Jesus hasn't said a word his mere presence walking off the boat enlisted this conversation just like the ones when brother and Adam was standing there and those demons are straining and crying out to each other of course you know in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus and those demons had to go same thing here it lives in a conversation Jesus didn't say anything but the demons are crying out Jesus thou Son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time and there was a good way off from them I heard of many swine feeding so the Devils the disabled the devil's besought him now they're asking they're begging they're praying they're not praying but they're they're begging Jesus uh the devil's besought him that is today really saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine now they've already recognized Jesus and his presence they have already acknowledged that he is greater than them and now they're acknowledging Jesus if you're going to cast us out which was inevitable they just said they're already they're already speaking their demise and Jesus hadn't said a single word his presence Jesus mere presence has got these Devils so afraid they've already spoken their demise now they don't die but they left the people that they were in if you're gonna cast us out cast us into those pigs over there and he said unto them one two letter word go amen go how many hours how many altars how much oil how much time and prayer has been how much yelling screaming has gone on to try to cast out devil when all Jesus did was say go amen it's the life behind the name Saints yes there was no oil pouring there was no laying on of hands there was no screaming no yelling no punching no shouting one two letter words go and that's all it took Jesus said one two letter word go and those demons had to flee and when he said go they were come out of those men they went into the heart of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep Place into the sea and perished in the waters it was such a spectacle to those that were attending to the to the swine that they ran back into the City and they asked Jesus that he would leave he delivers these men of these demonic spirits because see the spirits don't die they went from here went into the swine doesn't say where they went after the swine but it was such a a a spectacle to the people there they asked Jesus to leave after that can you imagine I would think oh let's keep him around a while he delivered these of their of those demonic spirits mine mine but it's the same though it's the same thing today people fear the supernatural a lot of times people fear the supernatural the moving of the spirit and the power of the Holy Ghost amen people feared it's the same thing today Amen to do the same way amen I got one more scripture I want to read and we'll close first John chapter 4 goes along with our song first John chapter 4. we'll begin with verse one beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world because remember it would be these Spirits would be so close now the spirits aren't closed but the way they conduct themselves and act will look so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible the spirits aren't closed they're vastly different but they'll act they'll pretend to be so close there that they'll look like the real thing when they're really not right amen because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and that is that Spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of God now he's talking about those evil spirits now he's talking about the good the spirits the Holy Spirit year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you is in the world praise the Lord greater season is is of course greater than the spirit is in the world but we also need to continue to remember just as the anointing of God is is a variation or different from the indwelling presence of Christ in your soul that anointing is just as important as your life is well not just as important but it's very important most important thing is you're born again and there's nothing to compare to that but that anointing in your life is is extremely important as well amen that that uh that presence of God that's not just in you but around you that is that is with us remember when he came on the day of Pentecost he came first with them and then in them praise the Lord so I had to be an anointing of the presence of the holy spirit with you to come and then in you and in that presence of God in you that of course that change when it's the anointing around it changes everything around you so it's very important to remember these angels of God though we may not be able to see them we may not be able to feel them or hear them we know that they're there we know that by faith the angels of God are encamped around about us because we fear him because we love him we Revere him God is our absolute he's our everything he's our typos he's our all in all so we know that when he protects and keeps and hedges us just like he hedged job just like he came when yahayza couldn't see them and Elisha was it looked like they were in trouble God was always there amen God was always there and the deepest darkest and the lowest of The Valleys God is always still there when it looks like there's no way out when it looks impossible and penetrable God is always there the angels of God are still in protection amen and I told you I pray for you amen those angels those flaming swords drawn to keep protection to keep you protected Amen to watch over us and to keep those Satan couldn't get by jobs he can't get by yours unless just like he did eventually with job he said okay I'll take down the Hedge okay Angels move out from around job but or move move out from what he really did is move out from around all that is jobs but stay with Joe because the direction from God to Satan was you can touch anything job has but don't touch him right so he instructed all those that around all that he has okay uh you can relax in and go away allow Satan and Satan came in and he took the animals he took the buildings he took these his children and all those things but he couldn't touch job and then the second time he came back and God said okay I'll take the heads down from job now you can touch him you can touch his flesh but you can't take his life so we know of course then boils in the head from his head to his feet and all that Satan did to job there amen because God because those angels had your protection had to follow the instructions whatever God told them they operated the pleasure of God yes whatever he told them and they had to then they had to disperse and go and then when it came to job but they could not take he could Satan could not take his life amen and job never did Curse God never did charge him foolishly yes he even told his wife who had been pushed over into the marginal colony of of unbelief you speak like a foolish woman you speak like an unbeliever God gives God takes away he's still God he's God on the mountain he's God in the valley he's the same God when I'm in perfect health he's the same God when I'm feeling under the weather he's same Godwin I don't have a dollar in my bank account he's saying God if I had a billion he's saying God doesn't change and he's the same God to me praise the Lord and he's here now saying praise the Lord is here now we believe amen we believe in faith praise the Lord let's stand if we could praise the Lord I believe he's obviously the Lord pleased yes with the worship with the praise of our lips giving him thanks amen amen giving him praise as he is with us always amen let's sing that horse again we'll just see the course of it well we'll see whatever the Lord decides to do greater is he that doesn't mean and he that is in the world all this is going on friend don't let it bother you don't let it fret you any amen God keeps you protected God is angels are around you amen greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is he that is in the world yes is in me where is he that is in Me Greater is he that is [Music] and God has promised us today is over amen hallelujah yes prayer is he that is where is he that is [Music] in the world Amen [Music] praise the Lord Jesus Hallelujah aren't you glad aren't you thankful today praise the Lord God protects us yes watches over his own he is with us now Saints to keep us and to protect and help us in
