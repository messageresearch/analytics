needs today lord jesus we come in humbleness of heart before the kingdom of kings and lord of lords yes amen thank you lord the one that died for our sins the one that was worthy father thank you god without you we are nothing without you we'll surely fail amen the father help us to recognize the day and the hour that we're living in we see how the enemy is just going crazy he's just doing some awful things father but greater heed us in us than heed us in the world amen and help us lord hallelujah i'll draw closer to you than ever before hey lord i can recall in the scriptures how your servant joshua was given the promise that as he stayed and obeyed your word lord that you'll give him the ability to defeat any enemy that comes his way hallelujah and father he said those gallant words as for me and my house we will serve amen yes but one day they were fighting the enemy and they they were losing and they lost father and joshua the man of god that he was he realized something was wrong and they found out that aiken had done things and taken things that he shouldn't have and lord there was sin in the camp and help us to recognize if there's sin in our lives to make it right right now to put it under the precious blood of jesus christ amen you can fool me you can fool the pastor but father let us all recognize we cannot fool you and help us father but we're we want to be the best uh christians that we can ever be for more of you father and lord there are needs there are people that are our precious family members of our family who need a healing touch from you father and lord we know that thou art our great physicians amen my jehovah are our healer father our high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed amen we send out uh your healing power to touch each and every request in each and every heart the hand that was you a healing touch and all the other niche father we know that we are joined from your living waters a fountain that shall never run dry even give us that abortion that we have need of may our cup runeth over may our hearts burn within us as we know we met with you amen the way this time father yes granted lord bless our pastor as he brings forth your word use them to speak to our hearts father amen our hearts be softened and ready to receive what portion of the word we have need of granted lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen thank you lord hallelujah amen you can be seated if you like amen something um something brother dennis said their beginning of his prayer kind of reminded me of a shirt you know my wife saw in tombstone you know you go to places like that they have all kinds of shirts with all kinds of uh yeah sayings but i mean you know impressions on them different pictures and sayings and things um i saw this one in one of the windows and my wife said you need to take a picture of that and it says common sense is so rare these days it should be classified as a superpower common sense is so rare should be considered a superpower today amen i thought that that was about right actually actually pretty uh pretty correct there sister pat had an appraised report here for her sister debra that my sister deborah during many tests and procedures searching for reason she was staggering and having true tremors in her hands when evaluations were concluded a blockage in a vessel was found during the heart catheterization all that was needed to help her clear the blockage is medication amen which she was already taking physical therapy was prescribed for staggering i want to thank the the church for praying for deborah during all this praising god for his loving-kindness special care for deborah uh he truly hears our prayers and is faithful to give healing and mercy when we ask him trusting him believing he will answer our prayers amen praise the lord thank god for that amen love praise reports amen praise the lord brother then brother danny has one he said last monday i got in my car to go visit my brother when i put my car in reverse my brake pedal went to the floor and wouldn't stop i was going towards alvernon and it wouldn't stop luckily i turned it and it swerved towards the cement parking area and stopped by hitting the uh hitting that part against the concrete the cement part uh avoiding alvernaut when i put it in drive the brakes caught and worked fine i drove to my brothers and had no problems until i stopped my car uh started it up and when i put it in drive it did the same thing as earlier i had to hit the uh garbage receptacle to stop oh goodness we checked brake fluid uh it was all the way down i praise god for not letting it become worse situation more damage possible injuries amen praise the lord god is always mine praise the lord amen praise the lord jesus thank god for that thank god in being mindful of us too isn't he thank you lord amen we'll go to song number 81 here amen uh i've never sang this song here uh i did not even know this song until a friend of mine i used to go visit up in the mountains of tennessee virginia virginia yeah virginia and uh he's just saying he's saying this song all the time and then i kind of forgot it and in study yesterday it came back to my heart over and over again and i thought well i'm going to have to look it up and figure out how to sing it again so i found somebody online that it sounded saying it the way i know it so we're going to try this jesus is the one amen number 81 we'll have it on here but i want to start with the chorus amen and um uh i think that might help a little bit so pray does anybody know this song i've never seen this jesus [Music] let him have his way until the day is done and when he speaks you know that the clouds will have to go just [Music] and the clouds there is one who watches or everywhere that you may go [Music] yes jesus is the one yes he's the only one let him have his way until [Music] just because he loves you so oh [Music] is [Applause] he will drive away [Music] amen oh jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] you'll know that the clowns they'll have to go just because he loves you so when you come to cross the [Music] your river and god you can live with him over on the other side oh jesus is the one yes he's the only one let him have his weight on you [Music] they'll have to go [Music] he's the only one amen amen he is the one he is the only one praise the lord we let him have his way praise the lord amen glory to the name of jesus hallelujah micah has a song for us now he wants to sing amen may the lord bless and touch him now i've seen it before it's been a while but a lot of people think it's a kids song but it's a christian song so amen uh feel free to sing along [Music] bless the lord [Music] [Music] there's a name i'm not is [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] it tells me is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] amen praise the lord hallelujah [Music] everyday [Music] yes [Music] i love jesus [Music] is [Music] and oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen amen praise the lord jesus hallelujah thank you jesus [Applause] amen praise the lord you love him today yes amen praise the lord love him with all my heart praise the lord he's worthy too yes amen praise god let's stand to our feet if we could amen i felt to ask when i was sitting there michael would sing if anybody had a testimony on your heart [Music] we were cutting some trees and limbs and things i set them on fire in our fire pit and i thought of something in the garage and i wanted to do so i stepped into the garage and i forgot i was burning a fire and there was some wood chips ground cover and set the ground on fire santa burned up her rose bushes she was pretty mad about that but i seen all the smoke coming and we had fire hoses we ran out there and doused it out up some roses nobody got hurt we didn't set anybody else's house on fire enough and so praise the lord something bad has to happen in order for something good to have amen yes praise the lord praise the lord we're okay from the ashes arising you beautiful roast wishes amen yes there you go amen sometimes that's the best soil when it's been burnt over oh yeah purify soda praise the lord amen but thank god even in our absence-mindedness sometimes he is always present he is always current-minded even when we have lapses he's still there praise the lord let's turn our bibles now to saint john chapter five i'm going to read a few verses of scripture here as you might probably already know the theme of the message today of course the theme of every message is about jesus medicine one in particular if you will i want to title it in the name of jesus praise the lord so but we're going to begin with our scripture reading in saint john chapter 5 verse 39 and that's where i want to start i felt the lord actually i think i was sitting in the bogan b is when the lord put this on my heart believe it or not um he's mindful wherever we are but then it's just it just evolved quite a bit from there so um saint john chapter 5 verse 39 before we read the word let's just buy our heads for word prayers again lord jesus father god we are so very thankful again of your grace and mercy and for blessing us once again to come to your house expecting you to do again as you have so many times before your holy spirit having its preeminence and your word speaking to our hearts and you revealing through your spirit that word to us helping us to grow and to become more like you and we know faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god believing that you're speaking this word to us lord it'll bring faith it'll raise faith in our lives to believe for whatever we have need of today sometimes whereas humans god we relate so much to the sea tasteful smell here and even to our spirits of imagination reason affection conscience but lord it's to go beyond that that that we can reach to a place where you are and the and the blessings and the benefits and and all that you have for us in this life god can't can't be measured in what we see tasteful smell here but lord it's measured in the spirit realm that you drop down in our hearts it reveals and shows to us things that are beyond what we can even imagine or think we thank you god that we can have faith to believe in that and we can have faith to know that as you promised it in your word it's not upon our abilities it's not upon our merits it's not upon anything we've done it's nothing we ever could do lord but we just simply believe your word we believe what you've told us we believe what you've showed us we believe what you've done for us lord and what you're continuing to do and that's where we stand that's where we are today lord that's where we stand that's what we believe that's our absolute that's our type host lord that's our everything today but thank god thank you lord that's all we need we thank you lord jesus for being with us again for the songs that are sung lord and for the testimony for the spirit that we have felt thus far and praying again lord that you would have preeminence in the remaining part of this service we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done you speak now speak through these lips you hear now hear through our ears and to you be all the glory honor and praise in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen saint john chapter 5 we'll begin with verse 39 search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you may have life i receive not honor for men but i know you that you have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive you can be seated if you like i obviously want to focus on the 43rd verse the 43rd verse being that jesus said i am come in my father's name i am come in my father's name well what was his name his name was jesus why was his name jesus because god sent an angel to come to mary to tell her his name shall be jesus and the first time that name was mentioned in company a baby that was dead in the mother's womb leaked to life amen that name jesus now that jesus that we believe of course is beyond just a a a nominal name jesus because it comes with the power and authority of the lord jesus christ he is god almighty and jesus said he comes in his father's name so his father has a name and his name is jesus because he came in that name and that earthly name identified the flesh of god who he was to us in this earth amen amen the only begotten son of god but you look here and see what jesus identifies as and what and what it is today look at this jesus said brother man of course mentioned this several times but he jesus said search the scripture that's the first thing to do amen i enjoyed that part of course brother dennis's prayer when he mentioned about that about the searching of the scripture because in here lies everything we have everything we need to know god himself and letter form to us is in this bible this bible's not jesus but everything in this he is the word amen the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he's the same yesterday today and forever so we searched the scripture so in searching the scripture what does that call for us it calls for us to get into into christ being in christ searching the word it helps us come to a revelation of who he is not just a name jesus not just a an authoritative figure that people claim to worship but jesus himself the only begotten son of god god himself god almighty veiled in flesh the creator of heaven and earth who encompasses all space time and eternity jesus search the scriptures for in the scripture now you think now he's talking to these unbelievers pharisees or sadducees they can't remember anyway that that jesus did the miracle on the sabbath and and uh they hate him for that and then he says uh i do my father's work and then they hated him even more because to do that is to claim to be the father and of course uh he was he just came in in flesh form so they hated him for it and jesus is speaking to them and he says in there amen now remember history always repeats itself so as it was then so is it today amen search the scripture for in that scripture now you think you think you have eternal life which means that they don't they think they do but they don't you think you have eternal life and those are the ones listen to this because this is how close it gets things they are the ones that testify of me they're the ones that say oh i'm a christian they're the ones that name oh look at the name on our church it says christ church or something to deal with that in some way oh look at this we identify with him if you don't identify with the word of god with with the part of god that we can't identify in our humanity with then you can't say that you identify with god just calling yourself a christian does not make you a christian just going to church here and there does not make you a christian we have to come and be who he is by the testimony of our lives identifying with the word if it doesn't identify with the word then you can sell you want if the church doesn't identify with the word then you can call it whatever you want you can say whatever you want it to be oh this is where jesus meets well is it amen jesus is saying here they these people believe the exact same thing they believed that jesus was or god was in their meetings god was with them that god was acceptable with what they were doing but jesus come and told him different you think you have eternal life but you don't know the word if you knew the word you would know me because the word speaks of me and if you knew the word by the revelation of the word not by knowledge but by the revelation the word you would know who i am and who it is that speaks to you but because you don't you search the scripture because you think you have eternal life and those are the people those are the ones that testify of me they testified me they say oh i'm a christian i identify myself here i i i go to church i i go to a christian church or whatever it might be or look at our denomination or look at our church or look at our building or look at what we do and look at our programs and look what we've accomplished and look what we do for the hungry and for the sick and all those things and identifying yourself that way all those things there's nothing in the world wrong with them but where's god in all of it that's right if god's not there it doesn't make any difference they are the ones that testify of him they testify of him but where is he amen where is he that's going to be the question where is he they testify of him but where is he see they said now i come in my father's name and you don't receive me but if somebody came in his own name him you receive and that's exactly what they do today they receive going to a uh to some denomination church or some church it tickles their ears or some church that tickles their intellect or whatever it is or some pacification of coming to church and feeling okay about yourself i got to go to heaven i went to church on easter and christmas you know something just to pacify a religion a covering well how could god god is a merciful god well god's a merciful god to people until they don't till he does something that they don't like or they do something without his intervention there's a words god well you've already turned him down right why are you calling on him now when over here you don't even want him he said well we say we're christians but you don't identify yourself with his word and if you don't identify yourself with his word then you can't identify yourself with him but they come in another name what name do they come well we tell us the word tells us in revelation 7 that they're blasphemious names or revelation 17 excuse me blasphemous names they come in all kinds of other names and they say but we have christ in our church we have jesus in our church we have our name is this and we have our name as that we're identifying ourselves to the world as this but you're not identifying yourself any more then who you as a human or or we as a congregation are without jesus christ that's all we are they come in a different name but what is that name he says i come in my father's name and his name is jesus i come in my father's name you don't receive me because i come in my father's name so where is he he said well he's in our church where is he he's in our church where is he he's in our denomination he's in our school he's in our seminary he's over here he's over there where is he though well it's a very simple question with a very simple answer let's go to deuteronomy chapter 16. we'll find out exactly where he is deuteronomy chapter 16. read the first six verses amen people come in their own name well we know that that name is nothing more than the ark of the beast brother brown teaches us that a denomination that name you come in any other name it's just the mark of the beast whether it's mama or all the harlots that came after her it's still the same beast mark of the beast that's all it is in a name what name any name other than the lord jesus christ he said well we come as as christians you come as christians but you won't even identify yourself with him in your baptism and you say you're a christian but yet you'll identify yourself in baptism of father son holy ghost you want to even identify yourself with jesus christ in your baptism and you say you're a christian i'm sorry friend it doesn't work that way oh jesus said to do in the father son the holy ghost yeah he said in the name oh we know very well father is not a name son is not a name what is his name what was the father's name his name is jesus amen and he is the lord jesus christ praise the lord and won't even identify themselves but we're christians well you you come from that same place revelation 17 and all these blasphemous names and what are they they're just nothing but the mark of the beast yes and that spirit now the mark of the beast is not a denomination the mark of the beast is the denominational spirit we talked about denominational spirit it's not catholic it's not presbyterian it's not method this is not pentecost it is a spirit that is behind that denomination nicolaitan spirit uh it's a spirit of the enemy and that spirit is what is the mark of the beast and people take it and don't even realize it when they take that into themselves and don't even realize it amen but now look where where is he now in deuteronomy 16 we find it out we find out where he is but as i was reading this this yesterday this scripture which brother adam uses in god's chosen place of worship is extremely powerful uh he ready to get to this one specific point that we want to get to and it's verse 13 and verse 6. but as i read it it became that much more alive and powerful to me yesterday so i'm going to take my time with this and go through it amen uh with the lord's help now look deuteronomy 16 1 he says observe the month of abia now we know that's well no no but that's april april is a bib is the month of april observe the month of abid and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night now look at look at the type and shadow of this old testament deuteronomy that that god is speaking to us today through if you look at he says to keep the passover unto the lord thy god or what was the passover the passover was the sacrificing of the of the paschal lamb the sacrifice of the innocent lamb that passover represented grace to them amen that passover represented grace to those that would believe it and those that would get under the blood those that were behind the blood that was applied on the doorpost and lentil those people god's grace applied to so this passover that was the sacrifice of that lamb showed grace to those that would believe it and receive it now they didn't make a disgrace out of it they believed it and received it exactly how god had presented it to moses to take that blood and to do all they did had to set up the lamb and it had to be found worthy and all the things he had to go through to bring it to the point that they could sacrifice it put the blood on the doorpost and lentil those that did that with the respect and the love and the sincerity that it deserved and as they said under that blood it was grace to them because god's the the death angel passed them by he found favor with them grace in in god's eyes to those people because they stayed alive as the death angel passed through so this passover of grace unto the lord thy god in the month of abid thy lord thy god brought thee forth out of the land of egypt now what does the land of egypt represent the world right the world god by his grace that sacrifice the grace that it represents brought us in by night i don't know about you but when you reach the darkest point of your life sometime in the darkest night of your life god by his grace calls us and brings us forth out of the world praise the lord amen by his sacrifice by his grace god called us forth out of that now we as gentiles had no hope had no purpose we weren't even a people but god sent his only begotten son to redeem humanity back to where it was before the fall in the garden of eden back to the place that was the perfection of god's mind and god sent that his only son jesus that identification of jesus to bridge that gap between god and man again that that blood would bring that gap and bring it back together through the grace of god and the forgiveness of sin we are able to approach the throne of god today just like adam did lift to ear praise the lord live to ear because of the sacrifice the grace that it represents to us the forgiveness of sin so that god calls us out of the world and sets us apart aside from the world and the world is all around us the turmoil of everything that's going on saints people in this country have slapped lost their minds yes absolutely every every week i hear some new things and i think how could a conscionable human be say that yeah it just blows my mind these people who've got masters and doctorates degrees make some of the most outrageously uncommonly ridiculous statements that are absolutely unfactionable and unable to be proved blows my mind and it seems to get worse every week but god has called us out of that praise the lord by the sacrifice of jesus by the grace of god through the passover god has called us forth out of the world by nine thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god actually it was the second verse not the third so we'll get to this let me i'll read the rest of this thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there where is he he's in the place that he chose you say is he here is he there is he in this church is he in that church is he in this domination is he in this seminary is he with this group of people he is where he place his name where he desires to place his name it's not based on where an individual decided to place a name oh this is this is god's church this we've named it as thus the pastor so and so the congregation so and so we got thousands or tens of thousands of members this is where god has placed his name the catholic church or the presbyterian church or some charismatic church or even some message he is where he says he is he is where he has chosen to place his name she understand it's not our choice it wasn't another man's choice right amen it's his choice it's god's choice where god chooses to place his name is where he is it's his choosing not my choosing amen no man's choosing no church no denomination a lot of people think that god is with them in fact what would be the purpose of going through the motions if it wasn't if you really didn't think why would you even go through the motions i mean i guess some people popularity money whatever out of power i don't know i i don't i don't understand all that because i i just i can't compute that um me and my wife one time we got somebody came and robbed stuff out of a storage unit that we had years and years and years ago in north carolina and i i i think about it and i thought about it and and we tried to say well how do you prevent it well you know to really prevent it you have to get in the mind of the criminal yes i just can't do that right so it was challenging to understand i mean what do you put up great walls fences uh razor wire i don't know something but you got to think like the criminal to understand how to keep him out and that's what all this cyber stuff's about today i think in fact i had a guy in the car one time and he said he was at a seminar for hacker seminar for hackers and stuff like that and he said he worked for the government i said well why are you doing this this he said because we have to know this to understand what they're doing the only way we can keep them from doing it is to know and understand how they do it and where they might go next and what might be their next target the only way to prevent it is to get into their minds yeah and i thought man and i and you think about that i i can't think like that so to think like how some people think what maybe a church or a minister or whatever i if you're doing it without believing that you're doing it in the truth of god's word by the spirit of god going to heaven and living for god if it is not that i just don't understand why they would even do it but you got to think like them and i can't do that so i'll just pass on that but where he is is where he chooses am it's not what i choose amen i would have never started this if i didn't feel the lord told me to right i would this is his work not mine amen this is his work he's put it in caretaker of our hands as caretakers as stewards of it but it's his work so if it's his work then it's up to him to to do with it as he pleases but it's not our choice it's not a man's choice it's not a denomination's choice it's not a it it's not tucson tabernacle brown tabernacle's not their choice it's god's choice where he is and he is where he chooses to be where he places his name is his choice not mine no matter what you call your church or whatever it might be it's his choice so now look in this place that god chooses it's his choice that that as you can see brother branham got from god's chosen place of worship right you see where he gets that now so in that that god has chosen that where he has chosen look what it says thou shalt we shall offer sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god in that place we are to offer those sacrifices in that place of god's choosing now look first peter chapter two first peter chapter two four and five to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious we know that of course that's jesus ye also now us we are lively stones built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices were these spiritual sacrifices to be offered they're supposed to be offered in the place of his choosing amen not just anywhere not a ball game or or a theater or something it's supposed these spiritual sacrifices that we have done this morning are to be in the place where he chooses to be praise the lord amen that's our spiritual sacrifice to him not the sleeping and throat of a lamb or bulls goats we that's not the gentile way our way is we all from spiritual sacrifices unto the lord acceptable to god by jesus christ how is it by jesus because it's in the place that he chose yes in his choosing ninth verse but ye are amen he's talking to us again now ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people amen now that makes me think about that story brother man i'm told about the old slave and people in the world think well you know i'm a christian too look at me but you just you look like all the rest of the slaves well yeah but i i'm a christian i'm a godly person you are when you look like all the rest of the slaves see remember when the slave buyer come to buy this slave he came up to the owner and said now what's with this guy i want to buy him well he's not for sale why did he want him because he carried himself different because he acted different because he looked different because he talked different because he walked and he talked and he had his shoulders through back and his head up that's the kind of band that he wanted not for sale so what makes him so different do you treat him different you do this different does he eat in a different food or something nope nope stays in the same quarters eats the same food lives the same lives does the same chores what makes him different well i wondered that he said i got to check it and found out that back home where he came from his daddy is a king that makes him a prince and because he was a prince of the king he acted like it he dressed like it he talked like it to where everybody else even a stranger come and can see there was something different about him amen something different about him and people by the drugs come and say well i'm the son of the king well you sure don't act like it right you sure don't look like it you sure don't talk like it and you say you're a son of the king a son of the king would be acting like the king he would be walking and talking and acting with dignity and respect amen toward everybody around him would know there's something different about him amen and that's what god has called for this bride for this last day she is a chosen generation praise the lord if she's a chosen generation we should act like it we should talk like it we should live like it to the point that everybody around us knows there's something different about you chosen generation royal priesthood a holy nation you look at some people's lives you call themselves christians and you don't see a speck of holiness about it right you can shine a black light on it and anything else there's no holiness there but yet they call themselves christian amen they are they that testify of me oh my saints look a holy nation a peculiar people yes we are getting more peculiar by the day as the world slides off into the abyss the bride is getting more peculiar every day amen peculiar people that you should show forth now what is this spiritual sacrifice this spiritual sacrifices is to show forth the praises of him who have called you out of what darkness unto his marvelous light praise the lord that is who god has called us to be that is who god has made us to be that's who we're supposed to emulate that's who we're supposed to look like act like talk like to where everybody realizes they may not know what it is but they know you're different they may just only call you peculiar but remember the bright calls you peculiar too or the bible because you put you here too so i'm okay with that amen a holy roller oh call me holy roller all you want friend cause the bible says i'm a holy nation amen glory they can give all the names tags all they want where is this sacrifice is to offer up those praises amen it's not the sleeping in front of bulls goats offering those sacrifices anymore it's the one sacrifice that came as our paschal lamb and that passover grace of god that has allowed us to be able to accept and receive that full and free of the lord jesus christ that we may now offer him spiritual sacrifices praises unto god that's acceptable by god through jesus christ amen look it's not through william branham it's not through perry green it's not the brand of tabernacle it's through jesus christ in him only am i amen that's where god chooses to place his name that's where he is where he chose to place his name i trust and believe that this is a place that god has chosen yes i mean times he visit us too especially lately oh my god god chooses to place his name here and we're here under that auspice and we're here to shine forth that light we're here to reflect jesus christ amen a lot of people think he's with them oh so did cain a cain thought he would cain thought he was with him too oh sure he did it's the exact same thing all the way back to cain and abel came brother branham tells cain built the altar he uh everything he did was exactly right it was it was all religious it was all according to the plan it was all according to exactly all except for one thing and that was the sacrifice the sacrifice is what made the difference he thought that uh plants a botany life would be would would be acceptable to god as a sacrifice but abel by revelation by faith by revelation knew what it took to offer the proper sacrifice and that's what the difference was cain thought he was because then it came look we'll go back to that part people with people that jesus was referencing they are they that testified me they're testifying of me and they're the ones that say they have eternal life but don't they're testifying to be that they do and you go back to cain and abel now if kane and get that mindset which again i like i said i i just i can't think it's just some limitations we have and one thing i don't want to think like a criminal yeah i can't but i don't want to but think about what cain is feeling at that time if cain didn't care why would he even go through the trouble if he didn't think he was doing what was pleasing to god why would he go through all the the the uh the motion and everything he did it's like i said about churches if they don't know or if they know that this is a wrong or a farce or or a facade whatever why do they even go through the motion i don't understand i don't get that i can just only believe that their people are doing what they're doing because they believe it's right and because they believe it's acceptable about god and i'll include all christians in that acceptable and what is right to god and in their church and what their denomination teaches or whatever they that that's what they do and that's what they believe i just got to accept that i just can't believe that people are doing it just as a facade just as a put on just to try to make look good maybe some people do i don't know but you know i just gotta believe those people are sincere they're just sincerely wrong i believe cain was sincere he was just sincerely wrong that's why when god not he went through all the all the uh trouble of doing everything he did but when god rejected his sacrifice that's why cain's countenance failed that's why cain got so mad and was disappointed because he felt like he was right it's like brother branham talked about the the disappointments in heaven the the the street walker the drunken or whatever they're not going to be surprised it's the person that's the religious one that thinks that they're right with god and god says you are the one that's testifying of me but you do not have eternal life they're the ones that's going to be disappointed right they're the ones that's going to be surprised king was genuinely according to the scripture surprised that god rejected his sacrifice because his countenance failed he got mad amen in life when you're expecting something and that thing happens it's like okay but when an unexpected thing happens and it comes to life you're like wow that's amazing or something is a different reaction he was expecting one reaction he got another so he didn't get what he was expecting so his countenance failed he got mad he got upset because he thought what he was doing was right but it wasn't he thought god was with him but he wasn't right how many people on that day are going to get to that place and god's going to i hate to say it depart from me ye that work iniquity i never knew you hmm it's gonna be top saints yes but the place where jesus is is the place he chooses to be amen he chooses let's go on third verse thou shall eat now look that that sacrifice has been offered the spiritual sacrifices the praises to god god is accepted it's in the place of his choosing now thou shall not eat no un no leavened bread with it no leavened bread thou shalt not partake of what is leaven sin unbelief thou shalt not partake of any sin okay thou shalt not partake of any sin no leaven don't eat any leather bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life do not partake of sin now look what he's saying thou shalt not eat leavened bread with it seven days now when the past when the passover lamb when when the the the ultimate sacrifice jesus christ came and he gave us life and he substituted the the type and shadow of that they were in egypt with moses the paschal lamb the passover lamb and he perfected that passover he perfected that paschal lamb because he was the ultimate god in flesh sacrifice now we are not to partake of any sin for seven days that seven days represents seven church ages from the time that jesus offered the sacrifice to today there will be no sin reckoned to you why because of god's grace because of the mercy of god those whom god has chosen and those places where god has chosen to place his name there will be no leaven because what does she do father forgive them and she says lord forgive me amen forgive my sin forgive my unbelief every day lord forgive my sin forgive my belief forgive my sins iniquities wrongdoings lord forgive them hide them under the blood annihilate them with the blood put them back on the head of satan or they'll lay to the day of judgment but they won't be accounted to me they won't be accounted to you no leaven no sin why not because of me because i'm a sin being to begin with this flesh is a sin being to begin with but there's no sin why because of the passover because of the sacrifice because of the blood that came forth from the sacrifice and the life that came from that sacrifice onto the worshiper now the grace of god reigns true again not the disgrace but the grace of god amen i don't want to take that blood and just trample over and do whatever we want to and say oh god forgive me let's say so many hail marys and novenas and whatever they are and pay out of purgatory and whatever they don't know what that is but the grace of god that meets the worshiper who is a holy nation who is a royal priesthood amen a peculiar people that the blood of christ that life has annihilated note from from the time of the sacrifice till today now people want to do away with it friend but it's still there today people want to take the blood off the mercy seat friend the blood is off the mercy seat brother ram said god won't even hear your prayer oh my leave it there praise god i i don't i don't claim to know it all i don't claim to uh uh be able to explain it all but i can tell you i believe it all amen and unfortunately sometimes people who seem to think they know it all will try to tell other people what they think that doesn't match up with the scripture right the message right but i believe it and i believe it to be true but from that time you see that now from that time god has called us out of the world in the time of that sacrifice for the seven days the seven church ages no sin no sin where to hurt to him that believes to the christian to the believer to the true christian i should say to the one that actually has been born again and lives by the dictates that that holy nation that royal priesthood those are the ones that god's that's the that was the the attributes in god's mind from before the foundation of the world right those are the ones who were part of him before there ever was a beginning of time life being anything else from that time now this sacrifice no leaven seven days neither shall it be any flesh which thou sacrifices look now no leaven bread forth first we're out of now no leavened bread seen with thee and all thy coast seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh amen which thou sacrifices the first day and even remain all night until the morning thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates amen not you not your choosing not your determination his gods it's god's choosing i can't tell you friend how many places that one when the lord put it on my heart start this church places that may have worked to have to start a congregation to start a church but this one place that god put it all together i had saw it somewhere maybe craigslist i can't remember and me and my wife were out and were just looking around and i told her i said you know what i think i'm just going to go over there and it was during the middle of the day i didn't think anybody be there i went over there door was propped open i said well there must be somebody here my wife says go in and check i said okay i'll go look see if there's anybody here i walked in the door the pastor was having a meeting with some other people i walked up he immediately left the meeting didn't didn't didn't say who are you what do you want what are you doing here he immediately left the building and came and talked to me he and forgot about he he didn't say i'll be with you in a minute he didn't say could you come back later he said here's my number call me right there he talked to me and he wanted so much money i said well you know we're just starting church i don't even know if anybody's coming it just might be me and my wife and he took less than half of what he had asked for for us to start worshiping them less than half and i thought that's just that's just the lord that's god placing all this together and bringing it to that place and something that god threw us that god could accomplish amen and then when god did this place he did basically the same thing yes and the and the owner of this the same thing so friend when it's god doing it god will make it work it's not my choosing i've tried you know i i told you i don't know how many times she says to teresa might not know but i i told you over and over i was i was bound and determined that i was going to get that place over on aina i went over there now how many times talked to the pastor everything saw the realtor brother john yarber met me out there with the realtor i went through all the motions everything looked and and tried my best to get in that place but it got it got so to the place that the realtor basically said to leave him alone yes [Music] okay god i'm trying to force something here that's not your will i don't know why but there's some reason so i i'm i'm done i'm i'm not going to say anything i'm not going to do anything god gave us a nice little hotel room for a little bit that we met in but then we came by this place so many times saw the number for rent saw the number for rent i don't know how many times i wrote it down i called it so it would be on my phone i didn't talk to him then but uh and just for months and months and just forgot about it let it go didn't do it and then one day i'm setting and it came on my heart i called the man he said i'm here now you come i say i'll be there in 10 minutes he said come on met me out here talked to him brought me in here i'm like wow this is a lot of junk in here and he wanted way more than what we could afford i said well we can't afford you yeah he wanted to give me one of the little offices up there that was about a fourth the size of this like yeah i know we there's we can't do that that that's not gonna work but thank you i appreciate it i was getting ready to leave he said well let me take you down here didn't have any air conditioning you remember that didn't have any air conditioning of course we didn't meet here without the air conditioning but didn't have any air conditioning and every obstacle god took care of it we compromised and worked this out got the air conditioner fixed and micah and my wife came and they they got their carpet cleaners and went over this thing six or eight times because it was filthy i know it looks dirty now but it was filthy dirty uh the water they dumped out was just black almost just filthy dirty and we had church that sunday yeah that was saturday night at 11 or 12 o'clock or something we set up the chairs he had to pull we had more of these things said there was one set in here there's one sitting there and there's one sitting there i'd pull all this stuff out they had to get all that stuff out of here i had to put new light bulbs in i mean it was like a dungeon in here but the guy said well what were you gonna what were you planning to pay over there i said that'd be about with with uh the utilities and all about 1200 a month he said that i'll that's what i'll charge you then 1200. i said what about utilities no utilities what about what about the insurance no no just 1200 all plus the tax the state tax says 12 30 something that's it that's simple it wasn't my choosing you understand my point it wasn't the place i was choosing it was god's choosing amen god's the one that said do that and when it's it's the one that the lord god gives us not what we may want or what where our desire thought about it is you know we can kick a door so much and we'll get ourselves in trouble i mean you can kick a door so hard sometimes you'll actually get that door open but on the other side it's not going to be help to help at all do you yes amen but if you could just just listen to the lord walk up to that door let god open that door and just walk through it and god will take care of all the rest yes and he has praise the lord he has so you see that's the part that people say that this is what we want this is what i want i know brother branham said that that god's will falls in line with the will of the with the congregation but if there's not a god called man leading that group that listens to god friend it's so easy to get that off kilter amen it is and say well this this is what we want but it doesn't matter what you want it doesn't matter what i want it's what he wants it's it's what he desires that sacrifice thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in amen what did jesus tell them he said they'll be others come in their name you'll receive them and that's exactly what people do today they got every other name every other thing and people followed by the flocks by the birds denominations whatever they are but where is his name where is he gonna be that's what i'm concerned with not my gate not not my choosing his choosing the place the lord god shall choose there thou shalt sacrifice the passover and even at the going down of the son because you have come out of the world out of egypt sorry i don't need to change the word so much but you know what i'm saying at the season that thou comest forth out of the world out of egypt the place that god has chosen in jesus name that's the place that god has chosen what did jesus tell him as i close here matthew chapter 2 uh chapter 7 verse 21 i read this scripture here a few weeks ago jesus said not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven well how do you know what the will of the father in heaven is it's right here amen that's it you can't learn it by intellect though can't read it like a newspaper a magazine it's got to come by revelation from jesus christ the word himself and that revelation comes and then it reveals to you what it is what's pleasing to the lord if you're born again and have the holy spirit god identifies that word to that spirit to make it alive and when it becomes alive it's in you a living oracle yes amen in you the living oracle praise the lord many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name hath cast out devils they can even acclaim to casting out devils but jesus said and in thy name done many wonderful works but jesus well profess to them i never knew you right i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity you mean casting out a devil was the working of iniquity according to jesus amen saints if we do anything i mean really anything outside of the word of god anything outside of the will of god in god's calling for our lives it it is not going to prosper yes it is not the will of god that's why we always try to identify the will of what is the will of god in this situation amen we we offer so many times blanket prayer requests and that's fine and we should but you know that means we need to always remember those prayer requests fall under the purview of god's word and will amen and if there's nothing else nothing else to throw a flag then you say well the word and will is for me to be well and by his stripes i'm healed so praise the lord that's my desire and that's my prayer that's where we leave it but many cast out devils and jesus said i've never had relations with you you know that's what that word new there is never knew you the new is i never had a relation with you you've never had relation to me oh sure you went about saying you were a christian you went about trying to speak in tongues and do all these wonderful works but it wasn't according to my will it was your gate not my gate it was what you wanted not what i want amen that's what god rejects am i not what i want to do why i want to go do this what does god say about it amen that's what matters because many will come and say they've done this and they've done that they are they that testify of me mine one more thing i'm going to read this scripture we'll close colossians chapter 3. the sad part is saying so many times people say and believe truly believe like i said with cain that god is with him when he is not he's not i i hate it's just true and i wouldn't say it if it wasn't plainly labeled in the scripture for us to read but it's just true we just read it they think he's with them but he's not but look at these wonderful verses being done but it's not of god that's not where god placed his name yes it's his choosing not mine not yours nobody else's colossians chapter 3 verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you all use forgave you so also do ye yes amen when the lord leads me i want to try to preach on that bitterness again the offense again but that forgiveness part is so powerful yes i still to this day have people from time to time tell me or i hear people say i could never forgive them they don't deserve forgiveness or some some words to that effect and it and then claim to be a christian and i said how do you even know the word how could you know the word and say those words right how could you know what jesus said about it and recognize by personal experience what god has done by forgiving you and then say those words although what i've done wasn't as bad as them really you're sure of that right that's what that's when people start uh uh classifying sin and that's just a worldly thing you know that's just a worldly thing the world has that that's what the world puts because the the justice system you know there's there's misdemeanors and there's higher categories there's federal crimes or state local crimes there's all levels of wrongdoings so you get up to a federal crime or something i guess you know walking walking unauthorized on this in the state capitol that that's chop your head off for doing that but that all levels of of crimes and see that's the mentality that people get well this certain this sin is worse than that i wasn't about a sinner as they were well they did this and they and and i was just a we're all sinners saved by the grace of god yes there's no big eyes there's no little use there's no respect or person with god so you can't say their sin was greater what god forgave them up what god's asked me to forgive them was more than what god forgave me no it's not never could be because i was a sinner saved by his grace i wanted nothing to do with him but thank god he never gave up on me so it baffles me sometimes i got off a little bit on that but that that forgiveness is very powerful for bearing one another forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do you and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness perfectness that is the agape love charity is agape that's a charity is a love and action and that's what agape is agape is a love and action and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be thankful that the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms hymns spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever whatsoever that pretty much means anything anything that you do whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus all of them does that mean baptizing amen i'm going to take his name you want to take on his name you want to be miss jesus look i am i am not i am not miss bennett hyphen jesus i miss jesus you understand are you willing to take on his name because when you take on his name you identify with him yes amen all the words all we do in word or need that's why people don't identify with themselves with it they'll identify with the father son of holy ghost or some denomination but they want to identify themselves with christ jesus christ the lord jesus christ because you had to take on his name no not not bennett hyphen jesus no it's just miss jesus i have become him praise the lord whatever in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him all that we do we do in jesus name praise the lord no other name that i know no other name under heaven where man can be saved but that name no other name that heals no other name with that power no other name with that strength no other name that has salvation in the name of jesus amen praise the lord and that name is where he chooses to place him yes doesn't matter what our banner says out front no matter what other any other sign says or what they identify themselves with the state so and so a church or he places yes it's his choosing not mine yes amen praise the lord let's stand if we could praise the lord in his name all we do we do in his name everything that we do to his glory and honor praise the lord to his glory and honor that's what we do thank you jesus amen let's sing this little course we worship a little before we go amen it's in the book but we'll have it here i don't remember what number it is but we'll just have it on the screen for us here jesus jesus jesus there's just something about that name why isn't that the truth praise the lord you know i know that's the truth because i've experienced it i've tested it i've tried it i've lived it i know it to be true amen praise the lord there's just something about that again let's sing it as we worship a little before we go today [Music] jesus jesus jesus there's just something about that name [Music] like the fragrance after the rain [Music] jesus jesus jesus let all heaven and earth [Music] will all pass away but there's something [Music] about that name oh yes hallelujah his name is jesus it's jesus sweet jesus [Music] there's just something about my name he's my master my savior jesus like the fragrance [Music] after the rain [Music] jesus jesus jesus [Music] kings and kingdoms they'll all pass away but there's something about that name oh yes there's something about that name yes there is saints yes we know it we've experienced it it's become our part of our lives it's become our life yes amen that name jesus precious spoken in faith brings results every time yes amen he said whatever you do in my name or whatever you ask in my name i will do it yes praise the lord where two or three are gathered in his name amen the place he chose to place his name his name people gathered by the thousands sometimes but are they in his name they come in his name well jesus told us you are the ones that testify you're the ones that say you're the ones but is he there two or three are together in my name amen it's the only place yes in his name amen not in a man's name not a pastor's name not a church name in his name praise the lord two or three are gathered there he will be amen there he will be and here he has been praise the lord met with us today praise god thank you jesus wonderful you know it's just getting so widespread saints i heard on the news the other day and my wife checked with somebody back there but there was a shooting at the eastridge and i know this

gaston north carolina it's amazing it's just everywhere can't hardly go anywhere it's not that evil is not present yes amen praise the lord but the evil doesn't dissuade us from doing what we know is right right amen in him praise the lord it in him amen thank you jesus brother pat had someone in his heart that he wanted to come up and present to us here today i'll let him explain it i could go into some detail but i'll let him do it because he says of course he experiences so it's great passion to him you can be seated if you like well i've had some conviction for some weeks and uh i i believe god's uh working with me the way he does he tells me what he wants me to think about what he wants me to do what what his plans are he's suggested to me two or three times to pray for others and i'm not very good at praying for others but um why me i guess he wants to tune me up i don't know but he's all i keep thinking that that i'm gonna do what he wants me to do and he said do this and it didn't happen and he said do this and it didn't happen and i guess the green lights are not lining up and so it seems like the lights lined up today for now and so the lord's here and i'm saying he's uh he's he's with us he's directing this uh it's not something i wanted to do but something that he wanted me to do or something he wants for you for you yes it's not for me yes i know i'm getting operated on tomorrow but that's that's fine i have no problem with that it's not normal i think so i don't think the same problem but um um he asked me to to pray for the sick and and [Music] we don't have very many people here today but evidently whoever's here is is who needs to hear this and who wants to do this it's for you amen the lord convicted me in this way he had me go search out these old um i give scrapbooks through the years and so i have um old old records and i guess i'm older than i think i am but uh i i i got this old record that he sent me after it took me a long time to search it out but i knew it was there and and he knew it was there and and today it found his way here so this is this is um from brother branham and it's um it's it's probably a forum letter but has his picture on it now and he signed it at the bottom and then there's a post grip on it and i see though there's there's a there's another form letter uh later behind it and it's uh brother branham signed his name uh reverend william branham and the second one says brother branham but in the old days we knew about the the typist was uh was a different person than the person that was uh dictating the letter in the old days the typist put his initials down there and he put bb slash wpb that means billy paul billy paul wrote this and that's billy paul signing brother branham on this on this one but that that tells me that um the bs on this one was was from billy paul but the the letter was signed by reverend branham and he prayed for this prayer cloth thank you and that's very cloth is what the holy spirit has been convicting me for i mean this is really old but uh he's been the holy spirit's been convicted me to bring this prayer cloth down here and pray for anyone that wants to come up here and touch this prank or a pair of cloth or be prayed for him you know i don't know what more i can say i just felt he told them he told people to believe and that unbelief was the sin well then he said go see him no more well if you believe it you can't unbelieve it i guess i cannot believe it stand go in sin no more but he said he could be healed and brother random used these little claws for to pray for emil people yes and then and then brother branham passed on after that but i'm willing to share this with you uh at this point in time that evidently is sister tracy mr theresa brother yes when i was coming to church i i'm sorry for something that they can't let me pray amen it's for everybody but you don't just one is all the things yes sometimes brother brown had big meetings everybody got healed but one was intentional god speaking this go ahead please come in yes [Music] this is a fulfillment you've presented you set it up now it's happening we love you lord jesus i believe in you yes yes for healing and we believe that we're going to god that is right thank you lord jesus christ the lord jesus said so the creator the savior thank you for [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] amen thank you a few weeks ago i gave the testimony how the lord prevented an accident they could hear me i prevented accident when i came down the stairs and i slipped and well i heard my my right shoulder and um i've been telling my wife she's you know in medical and i'm tired of seeing doctors be honest with you amen and um and i believe you know i'm even hurting a little bit right now but i just trust the lord yes with my brother and his conviction yes love to pray for us believers brother pray for me amen yes jesus praise god lord jesus you're the healer yes and jesus take this [Music] [Music] and now it's here you convict this yes to the point that jesus the pressure was so great it had to happen and now it's happening lord i'm i'm i'm here doing what you want me to do and so is the blood of me god hallelujah lord jesus christ amen thank you amen yes amen i i confess i'm tired of going to the doctor too amen i'm really really tired thank you jesus hallelujah [Music] vanillin did it years ago on purpose for being here today yes amen let it be god yes it's forever yesterday today and forever oh god we love you we believe in this thank you for the revelations please forgive our sins lord help us with our belief help us be not to sin anymore amen just to believe praise your name jesus we love you and it's a consistent prophecy medical doctors and just too many of them given too many medicines maybe she says help her [Music] and we appreciate you taking care of this we trust that you have it's in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen it's the word of god praise the lord it's the word of god praise the lord amen he convicted me and here i am it's coming to fulfillment today fulfill another work of the lord amen praise god do you want to say anything about them anybody else thank you amen thank you brother yes sir god bless you see god move here today amen see god both ends it's like i said not something that i asked for not something brother pat asked for when god's speaking to your hearts and speaking in his heart and god is moving he does it for a reason amen you know i could have after his over could have just asked me anybody wanted prayer but when god does something like that and puts such a strong conviction on somebody's heart and then on somebody's heart coming down the road and what the lord is doing here it's him amen we've got to believe it receive it praise the lord you know some people of the world nominal christians charismatic they they won't they won't believe it if there's just not a bunch of shouting screaming and speaking in tongues and going on but the power of god is here i feel it myself just pulsating through me and i know you do and that that's what i prayed for yes that's what i pray for every sunday but god is here you've been prayed for even if you didn't come up here amen god is delivered god is blessed god is touched i believe it amen praise the lord jesus i believe the lord's given you what you want sister trees amen praise the lord brother pat also felt that the lord spoke to him when we were talking last week about the word of god being the sword of the word and that sword hitting brother branham's hand at the pulpit rock sword mountain sabino canyon and that sword hit his hand that the lord spoke to him and had him bring a sword he had here today uh i didn't bring it in here i thought it might be a little distracting for the service and the ministry and all but uh but it put a little emphasis on the sword of the word and what it is when you look at it and you can touch it and you can see it and and it means something different than when you see that you think brother branham sword struck his hand and so it's outside so when we dismiss and go outside it was brother pat's desire that everybody look at it touch it get that in your heart and your mind that that sword that sword of the word and that that brother branham experienced when he was there uh up there praying that that word is a sharp powerful two-edged sword amen praise the lord so that will be out there too so amen praise the lord so before you leave make sure of course it's hard to miss it's sitting on my sitting on my desk there but um for everybody to see touch handle amen probably won't let the little ones take it out of its sheath but can see it anyway it's beautiful it's it's something to hold so i encourage them hold that i know it's symbolic or metaphoric of the word it's still what the word says yes and i don't believe the lord would have told brother pat to do that if there wasn't something to it so just like the prayer class and coming forth in prayer so amen thank you jesus do anyone else have anything before dismissed praise the lord god bless you appreciate each one of you coming being here today try something said to bless and strengthen you i certainly absolutely understand why the lord put this on my heart for today so it's just all him amen i know i know everybody does friends and i wouldn't be here if i didn't but i believe this is a place that god has chosen amen one of the places i'm not going to say we're the only obviously god has them all over the world i believe we're one of the places i believe and again i wouldn't be if i didn't believe that but amen i believe that the lord was pleased with what has been done today amen in his name in jesus name not in his name in jesus name this many people say in your name what is that name or in his name jesus name amen praise the lord so god reaches you bless you but you just pray lord we've jesus here to meet with you yes and we're so thankful that you came here to be with us yes thank you lord you try to do what you want us to do thank you jesus lord bless and be with each and every one of you yes we're believers yes jesus we believe we're the bride of christ thank you lord thank you lord we love you so much lord yes that's that you keep us safe and healthy and safe and safe and safe lord the world's a crazy place we don't just try to not think of those things amen they're good things yes they read the bible the bible is your word yes it tells you to think about these things amen yes yes thank you thank you jesus for being thoughtful of us yes in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
