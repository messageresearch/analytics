decisions and anything that's being done yes god we just want to just commit our lives to you even at this day lord as we're in a new york year may we just surrender over all to you yes no dear god to take us and just mold us into that perfect image of a perfect man statue of a perfect man yes father lord one thing i would desire more than anything else is that you'd fill our way with love and brain yes lord we know that satan is just going about like a roaring lion to put fear in the hearts of people just everywhere with these mass and this epidemic and oh god we know that fear has torment but perfect love casts out fear yes but if we could just have more love we thank you we know that there was a brother that had so much love that he was boiled in oil and the oil didn't touch him yes but to me if we could have more love of god then these pandemics and these viruses couldn't touch us and we'd just be filled with that love of god brother branham said that the greatest thing that we need is love we don't need more gifts we don't need more speaking in tongues we just need more of love yes well just draw us closer to you this morning and may you fill our way in our hearts with love

hearts lord god just may it manifest you lord god we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated and uh i didn't see any testimonies written down or uh sent in to brother ben or myself but does anyone have a testimony they'd like to share with the congregation this morning yes yes sorry oh okay um maybe i should go up there because i need i don't think we can hear you support this i think we can hear you right there okay um brother green i'm preempting my testimony by something that my pastor brother green has passed away did and it was so helpful to me because for many years i really struggled with trying to understand it and he gave the women an assignment in the church he said i want some of you sisters to a scripture uh next sunday and um and i want you to make a comment on it so the next sunday the there were three sisters who spoke and one of them gave her scripture and then gave her um what she the thoughts that came to her just a statement the third sister the last one gave her scripture and then she and then she gave her statement and then she started to move into another area adding a layer to that and then a layer to that and a layer to that and brother green stopped her and he said sister now you're patient hmm so that being said i've been in the book of nehemiah and it was so late last night i just said cuttings i don't care i'm just gonna read this bible and i was spend when i saw i've got to read you the scripture that i started i've read this bible so many times and i never saw this before it's nehemiah 9 if you want to see it at the end of the chapter and the first verse of the beginning of the of the next of chapter 10. it says behold we're servants this day for the lamb that you gave unto our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it behold we're servants in it and it yields much increase onto the kings when you set over us because of our sins also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distress and because of all of this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes levites and priests seal onto it now those that sealed were nehemiah and tertia and a string of names that takes up a a column of scripture so i was stunned when i saw nehemiah said they were sealed by agreeing to keep the covenant of the law given to moses i had to read it over i had i've never registered hearing it that way i always thought that was a new testament happening his brother branham explained as i sat back and pondered this god started downloading me he caused me to remember that no human could keep the it perfectly except jesus christ through his holy spirit our only covenant keeper keeping it perfectly he's worthy he's so worthy amen worthy of our praise yes i'm worthy of honor worthy of glory and power thank you sister thank you lord for others too but it was for her she grabbed my hand and she started crying so i believe god is just showing true again amen praise the lord does anyone else have a testimony they'd like to share this one brother yeah um this is actually from my dad so if i don't get this right i apologize but he was out um checking his mail one day and there's a new neighbor down the way where they live at he bought five acres and he saw my dad and decided to walk down the street and my dad first of all he was taking his time jenna walked up and juiced himself and said hello i wanna i just feel like led by the lord and talk to you some of that guy said well he's like it's amazing you know he's like i'm a believer this man they were talking and stuff and it got kind of deep in the conversation they said that he came i don't know where it is i know what's in tucson and they said that a church he came from got vandalized there's kids riding all over and they actually burned it down and he got there and he was running it inside and out trying to you know stop the fire and stuff and they said the fire department showed up they grabbed him and he was standing there still they were telling him he was on fire and he was like i'm not on fire and they actually gradually tackled him and rolled him and turned him out and when he stood back up they said he was still on fire and he said he just happened to glance over one of the vehicles and holding him was an angel he said he saw an angel holding him and he rededicated his life to the lord being surrendered and now what he's i guess him and my dad are going to be you know talking about the lord a lot having a little moment but it was just amazing to see that the lord is still with us every day my name is taking care of us and always you know he's in in lead if we just surrender so to me it was just it was an amazing story just to hear that you know these reasons happen every day if you would just stop amen listen hey man thank you um does anyone have a song special i know brother micah has one that would like to share it now just let me know if you do anyone else has one i'm gonna use a soundtrack again today um so this song i've seen before probably almost a year ago but i was i was looking up the uh the gentleman who wrote it and he was given a couple testimonies about the way people been touched one lady she said this song got her through chemo another said that her husband of 40 years had been making fun of her for going to church every sunday every sunday he would make fun of her and one day he was flipping through tv channels and the gather show was on and the booth brothers who sing this song was singing the song you know i got to the second verse he's broke he started to cry and from that point on he dedicated his life and went to the same church that he made fun of his wife for going um for two years until he passed so he had two years of life left amen that's what god just said praise the lord very much i felt this on my heart a couple weeks ago to see after i had sing the one last sunday so i hope it's a blessing to you [Music] i was working in town one afternoon attending some business affairs i heard a commotion a couple streets over i wondered what's happening there a young man was running from in that direction and stopped just to catch his breath i asked him to please tell me what was the hurry he smiled up to me and he said i was trying to catch the crippled mended here on he was rushing home to tell everyone what jesus did today and the mute man was telling myself as a deaf girl he's leaving to answer god's fault it's hard to believe but if you don't trust me ask the blind man he saw it [Music] my friends if the troubles and burdens you carry are heavier and dragging you down and you've tried everything you can possibly think of but there's no relief to be found that very same jesus that altered the future of the blind man the death and the land he's still reaching out in your hour [Music] this way he was rushing home to tell everyone what jesus said today and the mute man was telling myself and the deaf it's hard to believe but if you don't trust me [Music] ask the blind man he saw it all [Music] praise the lord [Music] [Music] [Music] let's just stand as we sing one last song before brother bennett comes up to bring to work this morning um as the deer enters for the water and then it's my heart's desire this year just to get closer to him or serve him the best that i can right it's number um six twelve six twelve in the song for those of you who want to use [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] desire and i love to work and [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] you alone are my [Music] is [Music] is [Music] my shoes [Music] is let's take it one more time [Music] sing it again [Music] you alone are my hearts desire and i long to worship amen praise the lord jesus how wonderful he is saints amen our whole hearts desire reason purpose is to serve him to love him live for him to worship him to glorify magnify and exalt his holy name he's above all other he's before all other he's unlike any other he's god he's the same yesterday today and forever he fails not he's here today to do the exceeding abundantly above all that any of us could ask or think yes and we trust him in all things amen amen he promised to never leave or forsake us brother tom was praying about love that's the greatest love i know of amen he promised to never leave us not only did he do what he did for us at calvary saving us from the devil's hell and bringing us and redeeming us back to him but he said i'll never leave you or forsake you i'll always be with you even unto the very end amen to the consummation to the time he calls us home to be with him amen the greatest worship we can give to the lord is to dedicate our lives and manifest our lives in his hands amen to be led by his spirit and to fulfill the purpose that he called each one of us to do amen each one of us have a purpose no matter how old how young how tall short male female everyone god has put in our lives amen praise the lord and i'm so thankful that he does that amen through his holy spirit amen through the seal of the holy spirit amen praise the lord jesus so thankful aren't you amen god bless you today appreciate the songs of her son and the spirit of the lord today amen let's turn in our bibles now if we could i'm going to go to the scripture now i uh i also i failed to put on there about brother jim as a prayer request if you think you may want to go his funeral is tuesday at the calvary chapel on speedway uh caleb duron and bobby roarke aren't going to be officiating but if you'd like to do that you may go remember brother jim i don't know how many brother jim but he was a precious brother we shared pinto beans together we got to talking one time at the tabernacle and we were talking about i was being me being from the south and didn't ever get any good pinto beans and you know ham hock anymore and stuff cornbread and onion and and uh you know he and he and he was just talking and then the next service he told sammy and next service he brought me a big thing of pinto beans and cornbread that sammy had made and uh i took the i took it back to him again i said could i get a refill it was a it was a it was a thing that me and him shared that was kind of neat because of the way that we were and all that i appreciate it brother jim he was a good chin good genuine godly man he wasn't fake he wasn't pretentious uh he was who he was and um i look forward to seeing him again one day amen amen it's just hard to understand sometimes but i don't guess it necessarily isn't for us to always understand right but we just believe and trust the lord that all things work together for our good because we love you amen but also i forgot to mention a good friend of mine back in north carolina bobby bobby i want to say bob your work again roby turner uh his pastor church in durham north carolina passed away this week just a couple of days ago and i didn't keep in constant contact with brother roby but brother roby opened his pulpit to me one of the first places i ever preached over 30 years ago was at brother robbie turner's church and i would ask that you would remember him pray for his family and those that are left behind there back in in durham in burlington raleigh area north carolina uh that the lord would just bless another one's gone home yes amen it's amazing it seems like it it comes in waves and it's just seems to be coming more rapidly anymore nowadays but um i appreciate the lord keeping us and blessing us and it's good to see each one of you and good to have you here today and appreciate those who may be streaming today pray the lord richly bless you as well so we're going to go into the bible and we're going to read and begin our scripture reading in revelation 13. um this has been on my heart for a long time especially since all the covetous stuff's been going on and all the things that's happening with the government and politics and because that has a lot to play with it if you realize through the bible through brother branham's message uh if you haven't really noticed it would probably listening to the message you probably maybe skip over you kind of tune out the things that's the political things but when you really go and you look in it and you see how many things brother branham talked about that were political uh it's it's quite outstanding i mean it's it's quite a bit because there's so much of it that plays its part in with the scripture and then with our current life through the scripture so um as it has been the other the other day uh the lord just put on my heart and he basically said you've been telling everybody this is revelation 13 this is revelation 13 this is revelation 13. so it says time to speak on a little bit so not that we haven't because i took revelation 13 as a whole one time a year and a half or so ago and went through the entire chapter uh four five six services of that so but i just want to get through to a specific part that i want to major on today at the lord willie so revelation 13. but before we read this bow our heads again if we could for word of prayer precious jesus again father we're very thankful of all that you do for us giving us and blessing us and lord the opportunity to be here today lord thank you for opening these doors and having this place provided for us that we can come in and worship you and to expect you lord to visit with us once again to speak your word and to minister to our hearts and lives lord it's not us lord but it's you it's not a singing it's not the words it's not the ministering it's it's you god and everything about you everything you is us lord and we just give ourselves to you in every way we thank you for all that is done and said lord and for our lives and for protecting us and keeping us safe and trusting and believing god for every prayer request and need lord your hand would be upon them and that need the answer already on the way for those needs god even before we prayed but believing father that you said ask we ask we ask and believe we don't ask amiss we ask and believe and trust you lord that you're going to answer and that you're going to meet every one of those needs and everyone that's upon our hearts in every situation whatever we're all going through lord it's a time of life lord where a purging is taking place and this world is purging itself and now all the things elements of it's purging itself and of course it's a it's a time uniting and a timing uniting of your bride yes coming together lord and rejoicing in your word believing god that you are the protector you're the leader you're the guide you're the strength you're the help lord we love you and thank you for all that you do for us lord we just pray as we commit the remaining part of this service in your hands we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to come and hinder or infiltrate or hurt this service in any way that you would have the praise and the glory and that all that you determined to be done would be done in the name of the lord jesus christ we committed to you and asked your blessings upon it bless these that have come today bless those that may be streaming father may you just speak to us from your word once again as we commit ourselves to you and ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen i'll just read a couple script a couple verses here begin with the 16th verse and we'll let you be seated revelation 13 verse 16 and he calls it all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell say that he had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that have to understand and count the number of the beast it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred three three score and six and you can be seated if you like that's part of the scripture i want to major on obviously we're coming to this point today because we we can't lose focus and realization of all the stuff that's going on remember the warnings that i've given several times to you my congregation uh of of the things that happen in the world and the way the devil works uh he he tries really hard to cause a great disturbance at the front door so you don't recognize that he's coming in the back door right right amen and all the things that goes on around we need to refocus and make sure the covet and the government the election and all this stuff that's going on first of all we're not of this world we're pilgrims and strangers we are elements of this world and we play our part in this world but we are not of this world we're just strangers pilgrims going through this land this cosmos doesn't belong to us this world does but this cosmos doesn't belong this world order does not belong to us so we stay in focus of exactly what's going on what's happening where it's coming from the things that's really behind what's happening today because they want to blame president trump they want to blame administration uh republicans want to blame biden or everyone everybody wants to blame everybody right and it gets back to the same as in the garden of eden when they fell everybody wanted to blame everybody else of course the eve it was a serpent and adam it was even it was a it was a blame game but we but all that is to try to distract the focus on what is really happening because there is a he in this whole thing that is orchestrating all this right that's bringing it to a scriptural head that we know is going to happen we've known for years we've heard it priests we've heard it talked about we heard brother brown talk about it we've read it in the bible we know where it's going to we know where it's headed up but we can't forget who were the head of it where it's coming from we begin this scripture that said and he so there's a he that is behind all this yes and it's not donald trump it's not biden it's not any supreme court justice it's not any form of government right the he is the devil amen the devil's the one that's behind all of this yes and if you look at that you can see that that he incarnates in another he to bring about what's happening in this country and in this world today so let's go back in and background and we can begin at the beginning of revelation 13 and read through it that'll help us pick up what we're talking about and get us to the point that where we're wanting to realize what's going on today am i well i told you when a lot of this stuff started or i mentioned a lot of this stuff started and i was in prayer uh the lord gave me some things i gave that to you off camera uh and i've never said those things on camera and i don't plan to say them on camera if i ever say them it won't be something that's published or out for anybody can see it because that's the warning that god gave me so i won't violate that unless he tells me to i won't violate that warning i want to keep it the way he tells me to do not that that diminishes what he said at all or what the fact of it is because everything he showed me and everything that i've mentioned to you he told me has happened and it's still happening actually too it has happened and it's still coming and it's still going on and and we can see it and it's become more prevalent and it's and it's gotten to the place that that's it's become so open with it so brazen with it that it happens out actually the corruption used to happen mostly behind closed doors nobody ever knew anything about it right but now there's no closed doors hardly anymore now obviously there's things that go on around us every day that if we knew what was happening it would really cringe us maybe but uh but a lot of that corruption is all out in the open yeah they just a lot of the times they just don't even care anymore uh news people will look in a camera and lie to you and don't care right right and when they get caught they don't apologize they don't because they just don't care and it just continues on and on and on like that and it and that's exactly what's behind all of this thing now look if you go back to the beginning let's let's let's go back to the beginning of this so i don't get ahead of myself revelation chapter 13 verse 1. now i'm not going to go through all the symbols and things like we did i went like i said through the whole scripture uh this whole chapter a year and a half ago or so so we won't get into all the things that give you little tidbits and stuff but we won't break this down like we did before but let's just read through because it helps us get us to where we are and i stood upon the sand of the sea and i saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy now we're talking about this beast this beast producing the mark of the beast this beast that's to rise up that's to take over and control most of humanity if not all of humanity at some point it will be all of humanity because the bride will be gone and the foolish virgin that's left will have to seal their testimony with their blood and he just takes over everything right of course then armageddon sets in and all but the beast is that beast that's that began here we see the beginning that rose up out of this out of the sea which we know is peoples multitudes peoples this is the beginning or the birth of that catholic church of that uh uh uh dominance that that rose up in europe uh almost 2 000 years ago right that came forth and this beast that rose up out of the people the people brought him forth the people caused it to be that way now it was it was that way because this beast by denotation of its characteristics of being a beast in itself will tell you that a beast is something that rules by fear and rules by dominance and rules by strength right because that's the very nature of a beast this beast and nature incarnate in not a man but in an office an office that different men have taken part in and we know you read in revelation 17 where it says he was he was not he was he was not he dies and another one comes up dies and another one raises up he dies and another one raises up it's an office not a specific person right amen now it it it wiggles it way through to where at the end time there's going to be one who is the beast at the end that takes over and rules over the whole thing obviously but behind it uh as you read revelation 17 that uh that beast is taking over that that church those people to dominate over them but it came out of the sea it came out of a place to where the people gave it it's it's its strength that gave it its ability to rule over them which is exactly what we do this this country does that to our government we the people have the power and we relinquish our power into the authority of men and women around the world that hold a political office we do that for the president vice president for uh senate for the house of representatives for our local members we vote we vote to put those people in so it's the people that give that person strength or authority to do what they do right now when they go awry and they start doing things that is detrimental to the people the people have a choice whether they want to vote that person out or not to get rid of that person that's their choice but in this case when that beast rose up there was no way to conquer that beast there was no way to overcome that beast because that beast had the uh had the uh the authority over it by the people and the people had become so uh tore down and defeated and overcome that that they were unable to rise up against it right so we'll just continue reading because here it says who is able to make war against the beast they weren't able to make war against them they weren't capable of building so because they weren't capable of doing it and there was no way of getting rid of him it's just it just continued to continued on and on but this beast came up out of the sea upon the santas he saw the beast rise up out of the people had the seven hands tens horns upon his head the names of blasphemy or as brother branham said blasphemous names again go back to revelation 17 you'll see the blasphemous names that brother branham was talking about you say what blasphemy blasphemous names are they any name now you can name all dominations whatever you want to name however you want to call them i don't whatever church i'm not going to do that but any name that supplants the name of jesus christ is a blasphemous name i don't care what you call it i don't care if it's catholic or some denomination or or a facet of the message or whatever charismatics or i don't it doesn't matter if it supplants the name of jesus christ and christ's authority over that church of those people that is a blasphemous name a church that tries to rule and dominate and take control over the people nicolaitan's spirit to dominate and control the people is a blasphemous name no matter what it is i don't care who it is i don't care if it's a person's name an individual's name pope priest potentate whoever it is if it takes precedent over jesus christ or tries to squash the name of jesus out it is a blasphemous name right right right right right right right right right right right amount amen that name's a blasphemy now brother brown talks about and calls them out of denominations and different things like that but the truth of it is what he was getting to the root is that if that it roots out what they do is root out christ right you root out christ you've got a blasphemous that's blasphemy in the eyes of god that's blasphemy now different churches and all have different ideas of heresy and blasphemy but rooting out christ is blasphemous when you get rid of jesus christ in any way or substitute for him that's blasphemy amen amen and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and if you want to we went through this daniel 7 uh four through seven uh it describes this his feet were like as a leopard or excuse me the beast i saw was like a leopard and his feet were as a the feet of a bear his mouth is the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority now the dragon you go to revelation 12 again we went through this several services uh i think we took one service on one verse but just again paraphrase to get where we want to get if you go back to revelation 12 you find out who the dragon is red dragon red dragon uh satan uh uh um the devil whatever whatever name he's got several names uh in here and every one of them try to or blasphemous names to try to squash out the name of jesus right but notice this dragon revelation 12 where did this dragon get his power where did the dragon get his power the dragon gave uh this beast power so where did the dragon get his power because he had to have power or authority to give to the beast he had to have it first to be able to give it if you guys if you don't have something you can't give it to somebody if you don't have it you can say i hope you get this or i impart this to you but if you don't have it you can't give it that that's the whole big flaw that people try even in the message sometimes that thinks that laying on of hands give people gifts no it doesn't that's a that is a a fallacy of a lot of the modern day teachings in christianity and the modern movement of charismatic churches and stuff they think you lay hands on and give them a gift no you don't you can't give somebody you don't have something you don't have am i now you can go to the scriptural part and you can lay hands on them and you can ordain them or recognize a specific gift to say i believe this gift is in you but you can't impart that gift to somebody if you don't have it and it's not yours to give in but if you go to revelation chapter 6 you'll see where he gets his power the bible says twice revelation chapter 6 verse 4 and 8 that it says that god gave power or power was given unto the beast do we need to read that i i don't i don't want to keep you too long today and i don't i'm not sure but if you go to chapter four look because this whole thing is dealing with the seals right this heals is history but now that or or most of the seals is history some of it's still coming but most of its history the church ages the rising up of the beast you see the the white horse the red horse the black horse the pale horse that's all that that that church riding out with the beast sitting on him conquering and to conquer or what did he do see first uh let's just read it real quick keep it in mind i saw the lamb open one of the seals i heard as it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see psalm beheld a white horse we're in revelation 6 now i hope i didn't lose you we're in revelation 6. and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw behold a white horse he said on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering him to conquer how can you conquer and conquer him without it without an arrow for your bow you can't conquer anybody without an arrow to go in your bow but a crown was given to him what's crown a crown is a is a diadem it is a state of authority over people right it's a state of of uh uh of your highness ship of being over people but this crown he didn't earn it he didn't deserve it it was just given to it right it was given to him a crown he had a bow so he's got some weaponry but he doesn't have an arrow but he takes his crown that was given to him going forth to conquer and to conquer and conquer to take over the people amen that's what his whole thing was to do to garner the wealth of the world because we'll get to that now but to conquer over the people how do you conquer the people he's not talking about killing them killing them with with a spiritual death but taking over them ruling over them nicolaitan go to the church ages revelation uh two three four two and three you can see the church ages where it starts out and how the conquering of that spirit takes over the people it pushes the people down through the early ages the catholic church would not even let the common person have the bible to read for themselves you just had to believe and accept whatever they told you and whatever they told you could be whatever they wanted it to be thus the property of the pope rising up basically saying well it has to be this way amen it's got to be this way and every catholic followed it didn't matter what it what the bible said the bible was irrelevant to those people right but then you had people come up and they started getting the bible and sometimes one by one they get the bible that the if they found out about it though now they'd burn them at the stake or they'd kill them in some way and destroy because they weren't supposed to do that they weren't supposed to have the bible they were just supposed to listen and obey whatever that priest was telling them whatever that pope declared and decreed that was it right no matter what the bible said whatever they said that's conquering they were conquering the people people say well there's a conquering of ministry over people no no not in the right ministry there's not right because there's no conquering because you're pointing people to jesus christ the word amen you're not giving people an ultimatum to say you have to believe me and listen to me and do what i say or else no i'm gonna read you quote a little bit later tell you exactly what kind of people those are right yes but a right kind of ministry actually leads people to jesus christ as they themselves are being led right and with christ to christ but this was to conquer the people conquer the laity and you're going to read the third church age second church age began well it began the first but the third one it really the the uh smarnia that myrrh was a bitter herb that was used to embalm people that died because that spirit had began to be rooted out of the church and the men the the the the people took over it the man took over the beast took over it conquering him to conquer now and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him power was given to him why was power well now who has power well we know the only power comes comes from the almighty god amen that's the only power that there is right i don't care who it's being utilized by i don't care who god has allowed to uh to use that authority but the only power that there is period is god's very bad that's all there is he said well someone so has power not without god he doesn't well you so your so-and-so utilizes that authority not without god he doesn't well so-and-so does this and this and the devil does this and this not without god's permission he doesn't right satan can't make one move without god's permission that's right period amen so who has the power almighty god right thank you all powerful god all knowing omnipotent omniscient all infinite all-knowing god only one so if there's power being given it's being given by god and he said power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and it was given unto him a great sword and we know spiritually a sword is the word well why would god give him power authority to use the sword the word to conquer over people when he was to to kill the people and to destroy the people because you know friend that the same holy spirit that is our uh uh our life that that is our promised land it's our ticket to the rapture our token it's the same holy spirit that's going to condemn the unbeliever that's right it's life to us it's death to them amen it's like to the believer when god brings revelation it's death to the person who takes letter only and manipulates it hybrids it whatever they do to it and that's exactly what the catholic church of course had just said the bible didn't mean anything to them they just took excerpts at it made it whatever they wanted it to be that's how you got christmas and easter and a lot of all the things that they do the the repentance and the paying the priest for everything they do and you know the the purgatory and all those things those all things just those just catholic dogma right that's not scriptural nothing scriptural to that it's just catholic dogma a lot of it came from pagan rome yeah which was the beast that was over at that time was rome romanism but let's continue here given power given a sword and when he had opened the third seal i heard a third beast say come and see and i beheld and lord my course it said on him had a pair of balances in his hand again of getting the wealth of the world and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts now this isn't a beast this is a voice in the midst of the beast see uh uh in the midst say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of body for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and wine that's jesus christ in the middle of the candlesticks crying out saying okay you've been given power you've been given authority you're weighing out the wealth of the world uh well uh prayers for this money and weddings for this money and and uh pendants for this money and and uh indulgences for this money in other words indulgence you can go live and do whatever you want just come back to the priest pay him a little bit of money and the priest will give you an indulgence and that will save you so you can go to heaven anyway so you go to the bar and get drunk and come back so i want a penance i want i want uh one of the indulgences the priest said you pay him enough money and give you indulgence and you can go and live however you want to live right it doesn't matter you come to a booth and say i had a catholic friend in north carolina he's my boss at one time and we were going down the road riding and i got to challenge about the catholic faith and i said well what about the this uh confessing to the priests i said now the bible says confess your faults one to another but that's not a priest in a booth right but it doesn't say confess your sin to be absolved of sin it just says confess your faults right if i confess confess my fault to you that i have a frailty in my life uh a weak spot that i want you to pray for me that gets strengthened that's the way the bible works but i'm not going to tell you i did this and this and this and and you absolve me of that right he said well it came from here and peter and peter was given the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatsoever on earth was bound in heaven i said but you you catholic church has taken that and monopolized it to to give people the power to actually step in the place of jesus christ right amen now i forgive you you forgive me we forgive one another but it's up to jesus christ that determines where it goes from there we go to heaven or whatever he he decides or determines see that's up to him that's his choice and i said well what are you going to do if you just set a cuss word to somebody on the street and you're going down the road and all of a sudden this truck is wrapped around the tree and you're dead where's your priest right where's your confession booth where is your indulgence then are you going to die center as you're headed 70 miles an hour toward that telephone pole you're going to say god forgive me or or pope forgive me or mary forgive me or whatever wait it's not there that's right the fallacy of it all but see all that stuff coming because we're gathering the wealth of the world gathering the the the people's conquering over the people and taking control over their lives and garnering the wealth of the world right amen brother man said nobody else could do it amen the wealth of the world nobody else could do it but where the vatican the pope garnering the wealth of the world but he said don't you dare touch my people now amen you worried about covert friend jesus already told him don't you touch my old and wine right here amen forget kova that's just a little a little toy in the sandbox for the devil forget about that jesus already said don't you touch my people amen now if you don't believe you're one of his now you might have a problem right that's right if you don't think you're one of jesus christ then you might have a problem but if you belong to christ this is to you right yeah don't you worry about that that's exactly the fear that satan has used to try to gain or garner control over the people right to scare them to death yeah it's just like uh they did in the dark ages if you if you have a bible and read this is what's going to happen to you and then take them out in town square they wouldn't privately persecute them they'd take them out in town square and they'd timed the elephants or something and rip them in half or burn them at the stake it was a great event to burn somebody at the state back then people got there applauded and carried on because somebody was getting burned at the stake right amen they said now look now if you don't obey that's what's going to happen to you what do you think that is that's the exact same fear the devil's using today right to try to garner control over you over god's people but jesus has already told him jesus already told satan don't you touch my people now amen amen don't you touch my holy wine i believe it amen when you open the forest hill i heard the fourth beast say come and see i looked and behold a pale horse his name that said on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth now it's quite the understanding when you go back to revelation 13 and you see what he talks about the beast which takes us back to daniel with the with the leopard the feet of the bear the mouth of the lion and the dragon giving him his power where to get that power well we see where he got the power the bible tells us right it's not something we have to guess about we know where he got it god gave it to him it's the only way he can get it right just like in the garden of eden see we got to understand the dragon and the beast are two different entities right just like just like the serpent and the devil are two separate entities i've heard people talk about the the serpent like that was the devil the serpent wasn't the devil that's true amen the serpent was an animal created by god right the the devil got in the serpent and used the serpent to do his devilish deeds just like he does a lot of people still today just like he does here that dragon gets in the beast just to perform his deadly deeds that's the only reason but that power and authority was given to him third verse now we're back in revelation 13. third verse and i saw one of his heads now as it were wounded to death one of his heads was wounded to death the fall of rome when rome took that deadly blow and rome fell there had to be something come forth after that after rome took over what did the devil do he said that deadly wound was healed how was that deadly wound healed the deadly wound was healed by the transferring of pagan rome to paparam right when the pagan rome had received that deadly blow and rome fell constantine came in and was able to take it over and bring christianity into it and and manipulate and and cause that to be all married in together just like balaam told the children of israel oh we're all one just marrying together it's going to be okay we're just one group of people no they weren't they weren't here either right but the people did it anyway intermingled and married in together and pagan rome became papal rome but pagan rome then then through to to satisfy the pagans they said well we'll just we'll just take over this sun god's day that we served as pagans and heathens and we'll just call it the son of god's day right and they made that christmas right december 25th the worship of the pagan son god's day they turned into the day of the birth of jesus so they tried to pacify just like you do today tried to pacify the pagans and the christians but they were never supposed to be mingled amen they were never supposed to be one group but the people lost their identity and when they lost their identity they came and molded themselves up into that place and you see on the church ages when brother branham when they get drawn out brother branham draws them when the holy spirit drew them on the wall at the tabernacle you see each one is just a little less light every age there's a little less each time right because as as those ages went along the true bride died out it went away you know brother graham said the end of this age was completely blacked out right but god the holy spirit allowed brother branham to put a little sliver of light in it because of you and me right yeah because of the bride that will be here at this last time waiting on a rapture only a little bit of light that there is friend amen and it's just a sliver it that that light at the end you go look at it as it was drawn just a sliver you look at that whole moon that is blacked out completely but that little bit of sliver you know what that means that means that we're just that small group that little remnant that god has at this last end that this alive and remain group i call us at the end it's just that just that little bit of light there that's here what was happening through the dark ages it was mostly it was mostly white when it started but then it blacked out and blacked out and blacked out as the devil took control over them and and pagan rome became papal wrong and they had the nicaea council and they crowned the pope and they allowed the pope to come in and they had great divisions because of what the catholic church did but in recent years those have uh they have reconciled a lot of their differences i showed you a video a couple years ago or so where it showed the pope and kenneth copeland yes i'll say his name yeah amen praising the pope and telling his congregation to worship under that and that they were all one together and they were all coming together again i also told you the rabbi that was responsible for that died in a car crow motorcycle crashed not long after that video right died amen why because god's in control but did that stop it oh no that didn't stop it it's still going on it's getting even it's gaining even more strength and fervor well what's happened to these people that'll sit there and appew and worship or praise the pope they've lost their identity they've lost their way i mean if they were ever christians to begin with the problem we've got today is we have too many part-time christians we have too many people that think they're christians and too many weak back pulpit uh preachers behind the pulpit that won't preach the word amen and tell the people and let them know that's right and they go home thinking everything's okay and it's not he's got a church load of people headed to hell and it's his fault because he won't call out the word the way it's supposed to be preached but there's only a sliver there's just that sliver friend i'm just thankful to god that we can be a part of that sliver that little bit of light you think how can this deception come because the people have sold their birthrights the people have lost their identity the people that give in to this laodicea age of my rights and my and me first and all they care about is me my for no more my little group what what we're doing what's going on here friend god is going doing something far beyond this little building far beyond this little ministry and us few people it's gone international around the world because god i believe is uniting his bride together under the auspice of the shed blood of jesus christ and this revealed word of the hour and he's bringing her together in a place that one of these days our loved ones are going to start appearing and god's going to call them we're going to go home to meet him amen amen we're right at hand this is happening now i don't know how long much longer we have friend right it could take years yet i don't know it may take minutes hours days months i don't know right but i know it's here yes i know that we won't know the day or the hour but i believe we'll know the time the season if you will and we're in that season we are in the season of the coming of the lord to quote a song title in the season of the coming of the lord amen it's now we see what's happening it's more prevalent than it ever has been yes because there's always been an uprising or something to counter when the devil would come and try to infiltrate that or take over that there's always been an uprising it's always been something to to counter that right and we know that scripture because the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood you'll raise another standard but now that doesn't just apply to christendom that applies to the bride today her personal life because as brother tom had prayed we know where this is headed we know where this is going right they talk about the prosperity and the blessings and the peace and all these things but we know in the midst of all those little things where this is headed and there's always been that little uprising always that little something to take over and conquer it and to have a a move of god powerful and strong to sweep across the nation or across the world but brother brown told us the revivals are over that's right but the international sweeping revivals are over right that's right well if the international sweeping revival 60 years ago was over then where are they today right they're over amen so then where is the revival in the brother you're looking at him turn around and look at one another find the mirror you are that revival amen you are that revival no more great sweeping revivals that little sliver can't make a great sweeping revival but internationally that bride's coming together and there'll be people i've never met in my life never spoke to people of different people tongue kindred nation we'll all gather together on that on that shore one day amen we'll meet the lord in the air i amen go to a wedding supper of the lamb we're at that place but let me continue because i want to get to this last part and there's a few things i want to mention to you and time of course sorry they worshipped the dragon which gave him power okay let me go back to the third verse now the the the wound he had the wound to death pagan rome the womb was healed papal roam and all the world wondered after the beast why because he because he gathered in the pagans and the christians right now what's what's the pope doing today got the most popular the not just the most popular do you realize we don't only have you go and look at statistics we do not only have the most popular pope ever we have the most popular individual internationally today is the pope the most popular singular individual drawing breath today is the pope amen what's he done he's reached out to this group and pulled him in he's reached out to this group and pulled him in reached out over here pulled him in i think even muslims there's only like 20 of muslims that disapprove of the pope one of the greatest approval ratings the pope gets is from the jews which shouldn't surprise us considering they're supposed to make a covenant by the time we get out of here right amen well of course they got to come together of course it's got to be that way see people can't they can't see the scripture no they're blind they're blind to see that they don't know a message they haven't seen a prophet they don't know what the word tells them amen people get distracted with all the little things that brother madam says on the side they get to the word of god you realize this is what's happening you told us 60 50 60 70 years ago right amen oh praise the lord amen all the world wandered after the beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast now look they're not worshiping the pope well they are they're not worshiping that church although they are they're not worshiping that denomination or that system though they are yeah all of that worship that comes from there goes right straight to the dragon to the beat to the to the devil to satan right that's exactly who they're worshipping they say oh we're worshiping in our in our church or not our denomination or our system or our denomination whatever we're worshiping this no you're worshiping the devil right if you're not worshiping god you're worshiping the devil and if you're not worshiping in spirit and in truth you're worshiping the devil yes amen now he says they worship the dragon who gave power to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him amen no one no one and there was given unto my mouth speaking great things of blasphemy power was given power was given unto him to continue the 40 in two months now that power that he had there that continues on now this jumps over this scripture actually jumps over to the scripture we just read mark of the beast in 42 months is the tribute is the tribulation as a as the last three and a half years of daniel 70 weeks right that's the 42 months you go back to revelation 11 you find that jesus talks about the word talks about the two witnesses of revelation 11 to the jews moses and elijah brother brown tell us moses and elijah in revelation 11 so three and a half years 42 months is three and a half years but that power was given so that he continues on this the scripture is telling us it doesn't come to an end it doesn't stop at a certain point it continues on even through tradition even through the tribulation even through that period of time even after the bride's gone in fact when the bride's gone it'll get even harder worse oh yeah talk about love brother tom there'll be no love when this bride's gone there'll be no love amen because she's the only love there is that's right the only love of god right there's probably going to be an over abundance of filio lust love but the love of god is going to be gone amen and he opened his mouth and blasphemed me against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven now how did he do that by manipulating the word by hydrating the word and it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them the dark ages power was given unto him over kindreds tongues and nations amen through the dark ages all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life the lamb slain from the foundation foundational world so those whose names not on the lamb's book of life put on there by god before the foundation of the world right everyone else will worship that beast yes everyone else will worship that dragon the only ones that won't are those whose names are on that lamb's book of life that sliver this last day this end time that sliver of light all the rest of it is going to worship the beast all the rest of it if any man have any or let him hear he that leadeth into captivity go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon spake as a dragon now this beast come out of the earth talking about the world of the united states this country there wasn't a bunch of people here but when those people came over they began to form this beast that was there that didn't come out of the people now but came out of earth now instead of the power that the original beast had which was a conglomeration of of church and state because over in england and over in the old country the church and state were married together they were blended they were one you had the power of one you got the power of the other but here we have a lamb a little lamb a little innocent lamb because we had freedom of religion and we had the constitution and we had the bill of rights and all those things are great although a lot of people today would just assume burn that uh or they misinterpret it right that we had all those freedom of religion and not freedom from religion but freedom of religion which the devil has used to come against us with well if it's freedom of religion then you've got to have this this this too you got to have muhammad you got to have buddhas and you've got to have uh all all the other religions muslims hindus you've got to have all these other religions and freedom of religion right well i have a religion my religion is to pick my toe that's my religion you got to accept me for that in fact you ought to be teaching it in school right how to play how to pick your toe right because that's my religion see because you can make a religion out of anything right people are doing it today they're calling themselves informing non-profit or corporations out of uh wear black shoe day or just crazy stuff uh goddesses and entities and all kinds of things they make churches that the church of the devil satan satan worshipers organized well if you're going to recognize this religion you've got to recognize this religion and and by the way why don't you take out everything that has to do with god when it comes to our government too take the bibles out of school of course no prayer because there's freedom of religion see if and if you're gonna do this you gotta you gotta you gotta have the koran in there and you gotta have the devil bible whatever you gotta have all these other religions everything in there see and and you might as well destroy every monument and every uh thing that he alludes to god and talks about the bible and christianity oh because if you do that you got to give me a chance too because i believe in uh worshiping some crazy person you know whatever their god is amen freedom of religion that's exactly what that's exactly how the devil has manipulated that but you understand the the the this lamb the innocency of it coming in it didn't come in like it came in in the old country in europe and it didn't come in with the conquering and the power and destroying not coming like a lamb and this lamb had two horns it was civil and ecclesiastical it was church and state they weren't married together when they came here man those forefathers put in that constitution that they were to be separate amen the church and state are to be separate they're not to have anything to do one with the other they're both separate entities the church is its own thing and the government is its own thing and the two shall not meet although there's tons of muddy areas today where they do they just won't acknowledge it because you've got running the thing anyway and i'm not talking about just the president i'm talking about everything around the world right we actually have a president now who'll be president for 18 more days seven more days that actually declared he was himself he declared himself as a non-denominational christian first time i've ever known a a president say that we're non-denominational christian or anybody in government i i found it dug up i probably wouldn't be able to get to this today but the things that was happening behind the back door of the devil coming in and the beast taking over and what pope francis has done to organize and to bring these back together and to start the ecumenical council which brother banham told us was the mark of the beast this mark of the beast is is the ecumenical council because he said of this image to the beast the image to the excuse me not the mark the image to the beast is the ecumenical council the mark of the beast comes from those denominations in fact they are the mark of the beast to accept their doctrine to fellowship to accept it in your head is the mark in your head to accepting the fellowship into the into that marcus to receive it in your hand people worried about barcodes and all this stuff on my hands and tattoos and things i'm not worried about a tattoo or barcode i'm worried about making sure and accepting the pure unadulterated word of god for this hour amen that's what my concern is and fellowship only with those of like precious faith amen that believe in the same not the others that go out and say well i believe in the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ of baptism father son the holy ghost makes no difference oh don't you fellowship with that that's the mark of the beast oh i believe we can come in together and and we can take communion together and we can you know just do it my way by process and i'll take the eucharist says that's the holy ghost yeah that's the mark of the beast amen that's the mark of the beast that's right our baptism brother the same aren't we brothers same thing balaam said it's happening today amen but this said back in 2016 that the united states supreme court is made up of five roman catholics and three jews you know that has changed now that three supreme court justices have been appointed in the past four years by president trump guess what denomination all three of his nominations are good catholic now there are seven out of nine supreme court justices that are catholic seven out of nine the other two are jewish the other two you don't hear from very much either i think it's bradley and kagan or those seven of the nine are roman catholics now the vice president says he's catholic the coming in uh pr president says he's catholic the head of the the minority leader of the senate says he's catholic the speaker of the house says she's catholic where are we at right amen these two horns like a like a lamb but it spoke like the dragon the devil and he exercised all the power of the first peace before him and caused the earth and then that dwelt therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that make it fire come down from heaven and on earth in the sight of man and deceived them that dwell on earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast because he had power because god gave it to him saying saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast the ecumenical council the council of churches which had the wound a wound by the sword and did live you know revelation 17 they all come together yes you shall ask economical accounts as the beast says god the church know that everyone all the little harlots that that spawn off of mother all come back to her again revelation 17. they all come and make one big image to the beast which is what did i mean you couldn't see it any more prominently in that video that i showed you with the with copeland and the pope coming together they're all part of that producing bringing the mark of the beast to the people the mark of the beast they say oh yeah well i i i believe this i joined this church i have this fellowship and they're using covet as a reason to control you over that too maybe lord willing we get to that minute and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed worship the image of the beast or be a part of that ecumenical move that ecumenical council that group of churches denominations people don't like the word denomination they use charismatic or calvary chapels whatever they want to call them i don't whatever they are right to be a part of that exact same group to coming together as a part of that group now years ago back in the 1700s i believe they had what was called an enlightenment that came out because this move has has happened before like not of course to this exact degree but it has happened before it is called in uh in the 1700s the enlightenment let's see let me see if i can find it i got a few minutes left please 17th a european philosophical philosophical movement known as the enlightenment or age of reason now listen to this very closely this has been 300 years ago but listen to what the enlightenment entailed or the brief description of what the enlightenment was if you don't know this this just very short but listen it encapsulates it to me and encapsulates really what you see going on in the world today by just the common person the age of reason what are they out here screaming and yelling at you believe the science follow the science believe the medicine follow the medicine believe the science that's what they're all saying oh we're going to follow the science we're going to believe the medicine we're going to believe the science that's what we're going to do yeah what is that that's denying god and saying oh well let's just believe what the scientists or what these people what these meant they put this great man fouchy on the tv all the time to continue to keep spewing whatever he wants to say on that day it seems to jump around like a kangaroo on a hot day but uh whatever he wants to say on that day you know he then he can say what he wants to say he's got the platform you've got to believe him if you don't believe what he's telling you you're you're wrong and denigrates you and and humiliates you or whatever but that's the the age of the enlightenment was the age of reason right it wasn't the age of faith it was the age of reason it was making its way across the atlantic ocean to the american colonies enlightenment thinkers listen now enlightenment thinkers emphasized a scientific and logical view of the world while downplaying religion now friend that was 300 years ago but if that doesn't tell you what's going on right now right that just shows you the same devices of the devil he was using then he's using now it's the same devil he's doing the exact same thing it just wasn't time for it then and there was a group that rose up over top of that enlightenment in this and whitfield and and uh whitefield and the different ministers that were in the colonies and going around and preaching the word and bringing the power of god and demonstration and then of course you had the azusa street of revival and the restoration of the gifts and and the moving of god began again right but now we're after that we're at the end of that time that time in those days have seen its day the sweeping revivals brother brown said are over right it's had its day this nation as brother tom reminded us turned god down in 1956 in 1957 brother brown said they did turn their back on god yes he confirmed it 1957. now today what have we got we've got the exact same thing taking place right an enlightenment where there's an encouragement everywhere around you in the government in the news and they're using koba to do it just like they're using covet to bring the great reset in what is a great reset well what is the word what does the prefix re mean bring back or again over reset what do they want to do they want to get rid of your freedoms and they want to reset it back to where it was before the enlightenment came or before the uh the great awakening came the enlightenment was an age of reason the awakening was a day of faith of godliness when men preached the word of god and and went up and down the country spreading the gospel of jesus christ that was called the great awakening now you've got the enlightenment or the great awakening back then you had people oh uh you had to follow the science we had to we have to look at the world in a way of reason now there's no faith in that how can you believe in a god that you can't touch or you can't feel and even if you do believe god why do you think a god would allow these people to starve or these people to die or these storms to happen or whatever it is so now they reason it all the way of course it's global warming or or climate change or or whatever they want to that's kind of the key word i guess yes now guns kill people sorry guns don't kill people people kill people but anyway it's all about reasoning it's all about scientific evidence logical worldview downplaying religion and religion became so formal and less personal during the time that it led to lower church attendance christians were feeling complacent their methods of worship and their dissolution with wealth and rationalism were dominating culture and many began to crave a return to that again a return to a to a faith-based life not just reason not just science not just what you could see tasteful smelling here but something that's so far beyond that faith a faith-based now it's gotten back gone back to where it was at that time what we see now friend is exactly what was happening there they were telling people calling people to bring to a a an enlightenment again a a an age of science and reason and logic rather than god and faith very much yes and now that they've allowed all that they've done that and let me tell you friend the news has manipulated you and i say you as a people not you as here in our church the people the news has manipulated the people the news has manipulated people's minds into thinking something that's not real not real according to god or his word right manipulated people's minds into believing and thinking one way instead of what's the truth it's called propaganda it's taking the story and said there's a whole story to this but we're only going to tell you the part we want you to hear right well if they're only telling you the part they want you to hear what are they doing they're manipulating you and people that stare at that stuff and listen to that and watch it all the time are being manipulated and they don't know it and they're being manipulated into a part away from god and into logic and reason and science away from faith away from god away from everything that's godly and back to science right and and education and religion they're saying oh they're crushing the small businesses of course they're crushing the small businesses how do you think revelation 13 that we just read is ever going to come to pass if they don't crush those small businesses right if they don't control and manipulate your minds how do you think they're ever going to be able to conquer you they're using cova to do it by fear they're scaring people out of their wits to where people walk on a hundred acre field with a mask on right amen nobody else without a 10 mile radius of them and they got a mask on those people are so scared they've manipulated people they've scared people into it now this great this great reset has come to be able to control people down to the point they say whoa we're going to pay off your debts and we're going to do this and that for you and we're gonna make it so much better now look in this great reset they're talking about paying off people's individual debts i know the big cry has been to pay off uh student loans and stuff like that but that's just the beginning of what they're doing can you imagine we actually have somebody in our senate who actually it well more than one now but that actually says he's a socialist democrat so he actually calls himself a socialist when i was a kid if somebody said they were a socialist i might kill him if not he'd be voted out the next election you wouldn't dare say that and they elect this man over and over and over and over again when he gets up in front of him and tells him he's a socialist i'm going to take everything away from you and give you nothing and conquer you and tell you where you can go and what you can do i mean socialist is just communist baby brother it's all the same it's all the same spirit right but the price of course is your individual freedoms the price of these concessions from this international monetary fund not the united states though the united states is a part of it this international monetary fund what do you think was happening under the previous administration i almost said his name the previous administration what do you think is happening for those eight years what are you going to think happen that's going to happen now when the same people that's coming up under that administration is coming up again that's right but it's all bringing it to an end amen it's all bringing it to this end right amen that's where we're at the prices of this concession from the monetary international monetary fund will be renunciation of private property you know what that means that means you're going to take your land yes they're going to take stuff that belongs to you amen well you've never owned it anyway you know that right yeah you've never actually owned the land anyway you don't pay your taxes and find out how long you own that land yeah you don't actually own it anyway but they're gonna actually seize it renunciate take back the private property and they're going to make you adhere to a program of vaccinations against covet 19 and covet 21. promoted by this specific billionaire with collaboration of course of the main part pharmaceutical groups well of course there are billions billionaire people that's going to get richer and why you think they're crushing the small businesses because all of these rich elite ruling class people are wanting to take complete control over everything that goes on the pope has already said that he is he has criticized the president he has criticized our way of life he has criticized our government and he has criticized our free enterprise system well the great reset is talking about getting away of that getting rid of that those freedoms and having it be government controlled what do they do to us then what happens to the little guy a little guy gets squashed you can see it happen in a microcosm in california i'm closing in a minute i'm sorry getting longer you can see a microcosm of it happening in california right now i've told people when i used to drive i told people uh that come out of california i said well there's so many people leaving california i found out the other week they're all going to solo too they're coming here in droves think why are they coming here because they're getting out of there just trump take that wall make a hard right at uma anyway but it's a microcosm of it you're going to end up california is becoming a state of the e rich elite and the ones that serve them that's all california's becoming middle class is gone because they're all coming here because they're being squeezed out and a little guy can't go because he didn't have a choice he's going to serve them he's going to be his mickey mouse at disneyland and he's going to be the waiter at the cheesecake factory and he's going to be the one that run the camera that allows those billionaires to show themselves on tv right you got to have those people so you got the billionaires and the rich elites you got the ones that serve them that's exactly what they want and that's what's going on that's the one thing the great reset is going to do all the while doing what to the christian well you're not even in the picture yeah they're just squeezing you out i mean the the pope and priests have already told us years ago hold up a message book and said this is our greatest enemy well then what do you think it is what do you think that's going to be for us amen amen but god has already prepared the way remember revelation 12 see god has that hiding place for the bride he takes her home i do want to read this quote to you though we get to where they can that you can you can't buy or sell unless you're part of that system that's right now this he's talking about church he's talking about ministers he's talking about false prophets but listen what he says in in in it is true there it is still true with church and ministry and false prophets but look what he says it but it also relates to me to the picture as a whole of the fear the fear amen the fear fear is the greatest tool yeah amen the devil's used to manipulate people and control people the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts this is the laodicean church age is that the seven church ages started out with the antichrist spirit as well as the holy spirit who is blessed forever first john 4 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits where they are of god because many false prophets have gone out into the world did you notice it the antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets the ages came in with false prophets and they will go out with false prophets now what happens to the false prophet today just like it did then just like happens to the news media they'll tell you whatever they want a lot of times lies if somebody catches them and proves they lied yeah they don't say anything about it they don't do anything about it that's they spend they spend 10 weeks on the lie and if they find out the lies wrong they spend 10 seconds on a retraction right that you'll never find you know it's the same thing false prophets are the same way who follows this are you going to prophesy to me and tell me something specific about tomorrow or next week well you know what i'm going to hang around tomorrow next week and i'm going to find out what you're saying is right or not don't just give me a bunch of flatteries and things that tickle my intellect or my my uh thinking i don't want to hear that that's not prophecy prophecy is telling you what's going to happen next and what's going on and what's happening here what's going to happen in your life and what's happening in this united states and not just saying oh well you know uh biden's going to be inaugurated january 20th well duh it's not a prophecy we all know that but see when they do something then it doesn't happen what happens to them right you know what happens to them they get thrown on tv or youtube again next week some of these people prophesy more in a month than brother branham a vindicated word prophet prophesied in an entire life right right yeah i i think they prophesy about what cheerio they're gonna have for breakfast anyway false prophets come in with false prophets it will go out with false prophets if we're going out now where are we going out now of course there is going to be a real false prophet that's the beast in the grand sense of that man mentioned in revelation but as for now the revelation false prophets let me move down sorry it's getting late it's talking about false prophets false teachers taking over people enticing spirits uh first timothy 4 1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirits doctrines of devils now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word amen outside the word logic reason understanding science outside the word just as we showed you that antichrist means anti-word so false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how and what were those ends brother brown told us it's three mostly three of them money women popularity right now most of it seems like today is money it's money the love of money has become so rampant but that's for another service to the have you ever noticed how people how the people lead others astray listen now have you ever noticed how the people who are who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets amen how do false prophets operate by fear they bind the people to themselves closely by fear now yes that is true in the church yes that is true with false prophets in the religious world and in christian world but that's the same thing is happening in the world today what is the warnings out there if you don't do what we tell you we're going to shut your business down we're going to find you thousands of dollars you're going to get covered and die scare people scare them to death like i said to the point to where most of the simple people just get crushed out [Music] but they bind the people to themselves with fear fear is the driving factor to understand today yeah amen fear is what and they're using covet to do it with now i this has been maybe debunked by others i don't know but i i don't know that you'll ever get me to understand or believe that this wasn't released on purpose i really believe it was now on purpose by saying i believe god orchestrated the whole thing to bring it out the way it's supposed to be brought out i believe the people that were anointed to do it did it exactly in its own purpose and is to do what is exactly what it's doing if you get a cold you know what happens you know what to do you take medicine where you get the flu those things but with covet there are people who have no symptoms at all there are people who have you know a little bit of a fever runny nose or something and there's some people that die right right within a few days die dead right a cobit now i don't understand the science of medicine you have to talk to mike about after church about that but i don't understand the science and medicine of it but a strand of a of a disease that that for one person doesn't even affect them and the other person they're dead within a few days they're it's it's more than my little pee brain can comprehend but when i look in the religious spiritual world about it there's something more to it than what people understand is going on it's a vehicle to control and manipulate people and to bring fear into your life and it's working yes it's working because people have lost their identity it's working because people have sold their reputation they have sold their birthrights they have sold their uh their liberties and their freedoms over to a government or over to an entity and they've they've relinquished everything you have as long as they're a little for no more is okay that's all they care about you're right amen a great fuss i'm closing a great fuss has come out recently because congress in their nice high mighty ordinances wanted to give you the people under them the common people the little people they want to give you 600 let's just go build a mansion why don't we i'm gonna take my 600 and go to the dealership buy me a new car 600 600 these people made six hundred dollars in a minute right right they make six hundred dollars they made tens of thousands of dollars just deciding what little piddly stuff they were gonna give you right and there's a great fuss about it and and a lot of the physical responsible people are mad because they said well we can't give them the president said well we need to give them at least 2 000. i agree with it and crazy enough uh two other people i was gonna use some adjectives but two other people believe agree with him who never agreed with him about anything i agree with him if you cause people to not be able to make a living you should be the one to help them you should be the one to take care of them six hundred dollars doesn't even pay a person's rent for a month right in certain cities it won't even pay for a meal hardly i mean the the governor of california got caught in this restaurant not social distance nobody had a mass the restaurants were supposed to be closed there's 13 or 14 people their meal what i heard was twelve hundred dollars per person wow six hundred dollars wouldn't even pay the appetizer and a soda six hundred i think what are these poor people going to do with 600 dollars and they thought that was a big deal and they're worried to death the physical responsibility which i am i am physically responsible i understand if i don't balance my checkbook bad things happen amen we as common people understand if we don't balance our paycheck our uh checkbooks bad things happen we know that they don't seem to right so i am physically responsible but they're scared to death over a half a billion dollars which most of them could carry in their front pockets when the debt is 35 trillion they're worried about another half a billion or a half a half a trillion whatever it is it's pendley compared to to what it already is they think they're going to do something about that or bring that into a reasonable level that's never going to happen meanwhile the people are dying and suffering hurting now for me personally i don't care if i get the money it's not that big god has blessed us yes i told y'all i took a whole service and talked about how blessed god's people are in the middle of this crisis right god has blessed us and i'm thankful god's been but it's not about that it's not about the money it's about the principle you're right yeah and unfortunately it seems like that's a word that's abstract or missing in the government today in the world today principle who has principles today not very many people it doesn't seem but what is it to do is to control yeah oh well you you just pander our feet we'll we'll throw you some morsels here and there you know right and then others want to come and say well we just we just want to give you you know 2 000 a month for the rest of your life well all they want you to do is to come and grovel at their feet because then if you don't because remember what i tell you before i'm closing with this the more they pay you the more they own you that's right period if they pay you and say well we'll give them we'll erase this debt and erase that debt give them so much money every month yeah they do that what if they decide they're going to take it away from you and you've come to depend on it right you're at their mercy amen revelation 13 my friend revelation 13 especially 16 17 18 is here brother bannon's already identified the mark of the beast for us i did it in a brief moment with you we know what it is we know what the ecumenical council and the image of the beast is we know where it's coming from we know who's behind it we know who that he is and don't lose focus all this stuff out here gets you lost in focus yeah i hear mike has told me once if he's told me a dozen times i don't ever listen to the news watch the news or anything anymore uh because the manipulation it's all to manipulate yeah it's all to get you first of all satan wants to get you away from the word and away from god and then manipulate you into coming to losing your identity and to losing your birthright losing your your place and and giving in to all the things that's going on we are we are citizens of another civilization amen citizens over there it's been on my heart might start that next week we'll see what the lord does yeah citizens of a different civilization amen and i believe that those sliver that's still left here is going to be taking our flight pretty soon again i don't know how long amen i mean days a thousand years a thousand years is one day with him and so a thousand years of dropping the bucket to the lord that's i don't know how long it's going to be minutes days hours years months i don't know but i know it's close nowhere at hand i believe i'll be here to see it taste it but brother brown i believe that too so we don't know but i know it's here right when the things of the scripture are wrapping up the way they are today it becomes very prevalent and evident of where we're headed where we're at amen let's stand if we could all right that may be the longest i've ever preached since i had the church here good job but i appreciate it i pray something said to bless you today amen truth stand upon and realize what the lord is doing what's happening to us today man let's sing this psalm number 523 i would find a thought out to put it up because i want to read i want to sing the verses of it too [Music] it's 5 23 in the song book but it's only it only has the chorus in the song book so uh if you remember it we've sang it i've sang
