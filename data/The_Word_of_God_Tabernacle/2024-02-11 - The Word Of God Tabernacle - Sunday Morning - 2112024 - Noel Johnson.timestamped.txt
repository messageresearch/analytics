[28:23] we stand for your word we stand for the
[28:26] revealed word
[28:28] we stand as real Christians displaying
[28:32] your life through US Lord Lord I can
[28:36] remember there was a prophet Elisha
[28:39] there was some men that gathered some
[28:41] wild G gourds and Lord they start
[28:44] cooking those gourds and they realized
[28:47] there was death in the pot my and there
[28:50] was a prophet that came on the scene
[28:52] Elisha and he he sprinkled some meal off
[28:57] offering and he says now everything is
[29:00] fine we know the meal offering
[29:02] represented you Lord yes amen and Lord
[29:05] there's a lot that's going forth amongst
[29:08] us even as Believers anything that's
[29:11] contrary to the truth to the word for
[29:15] the hour is death in the PT help us to
[29:19] recognize the devil and all his tricks
[29:22] to stand for you Lord to live a life
[29:26] that's worth
[29:27] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ yes Jesus
[29:31] to recognize Lord as our brother said
[29:34] already if there's one that's going we
[29:37] have to have the faith to believe with
[29:40] that one yes and Lord amen don't let us
[29:43] fail you in anything that we do Lord
[29:47] there's a lot of carnality that's
[29:49] fighting your people and I heard your
[29:52] Prophet say worldliness is killing the
[29:55] church and Lord we want to be
[29:58] identified with you at all times take
[30:01] all carnality out of us take all
[30:04] worldliness out of us take all unbelief
[30:08] away from us and Lord help us now as we
[30:12] approach your throne Grant it Lord but
[30:14] we know that you hear the cries of the
[30:17] righteous and your faces against them
[30:20] that do evil and Lord there are many
[30:23] that are sick
[30:24] today but greater he that's in us
[30:27] hallelujah and he Us in the world yes
[30:30] Lord and when Satan comes like a flood
[30:32] you'll raise that standard Lord to fight
[30:35] the devil every time there's many that

[40:21] privilege to be here amen um if you
[40:24] would stand in honor of God's word we'll
[40:27] read Gospel of John 1 read verses down 1
[40:31] through
[40:42] 5 right here it says in the beginning
[40:45] was the word the word was with God and
[40:47] the Word was God the same was in the
[40:49] beginning with God Amen all things were
[40:51] made by him and without him was not
[40:53] anything made that was made and in him
[40:56] was life and the life was the light of
[40:58] men and the light shineth in the
[40:59] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[41:02] it not amen let's just
[41:05] pray our most gracious and loving
[41:07] Heavenly Father it is again our
[41:09] privilege to come and gather together
[41:10] throughout your
[41:12] word we realize Lord we are at the end
[41:15] time and Lord there are certain things
[41:17] which supposed to come to pass within
[41:19] our lives yes because Lord you're
[41:21] wanting to live and express your life
[41:23] now through us thank you Jesus Take Me
[41:25] Lord as your servant this
[41:27] morning Watch Over The Words which are
[41:29] spoken that Lord what are the things
[41:32] which are said Lord may they come from
[41:33] you grant it God I ask it in Jesus
[41:36] Christ's name amen amen be
[41:41] seated what got me started on this whole
[41:44] subject was in God's power to
[41:47] transform brother Brandon made this
[41:49] statement he says Jesus Christ was God
[41:51] himself manifested because he was a son
[41:55] because he was begotten but it was just
[41:57] a tabernacle for him to live in amen no
[42:01] man has seen God at any time but the
[42:02] only begotten of the father has declared
[42:04] him he said God built himself a house a
[42:08] body to live in to come down so that we
[42:11] could touch him amen and that's what I
[42:14] got to I got to reading this and because
[42:16] now from the things that I understand
[42:18] from the message we are the Tabernacle
[42:21] yes we are the body of Jesus Christ yes
[42:25] but what are we understand about this
[42:27] body what me we you know we it's it's
[42:30] like what the reason we went over last
[42:32] time in the beginning was the word well
[42:33] the word to me is you know write a piece
[42:35] of paper and take scribble something
[42:37] down well that's a word you know I mean
[42:39] that's okay but it says in the beginning
[42:41] was there was a
[42:42] logos and the logos is what we tried to
[42:45] cover last time because the logos is the
[42:48] very essence of everything that God is
[42:51] amen I mean you know it like I say I was
[42:53] RA raised as a trinitarian well the
[42:55] father he the spirit that lived you know
[42:58] he guided the children of Israel well
[43:00] then he came in a body we called Jesus
[43:02] Christ we celebrate when he's in a baby
[43:04] and know we we weep when we find out he
[43:06] hung upon a cross and now we have this
[43:09] Spirit that's kind of like a a spirit
[43:11] tire to us that if we get in trouble
[43:13] then we call upon him and then when all
[43:14] of a sudden trouble goes away well then
[43:16] we figure now I can do it by
[43:18] myself but see that from the message
[43:20] that we have we begin to understand now
[43:23] that is all false yeah we have to
[43:26] understand as God came and God in
[43:28] different times and different
[43:29] dispensation God came for the sole
[43:31] purpose of expressing himself yes
[43:34] because he wants to be known he want he
[43:35] wants us to know who he is and what he
[43:38] is but also you don't not you will not
[43:41] understand who you are until you
[43:43] understand who Jesus Christ is amen
[43:45] because we are his body I literally we
[43:47] say oh yeah we're the body of Christ but
[43:50] we do do we understand that
[43:53] literally we literally are his body
[43:56] yes where does God dwell today I'm
[43:58] looking at him amen but he's wanting to
[44:01] release himself he's wanting to express
[44:03] himself yes and and and and so this this
[44:06] is the you know any this is the thought
[44:09] today one of the purposes he came he
[44:12] came in Jesus Christ he came in in Jesus
[44:14] Christ so that he can make himself known
[44:17] yes it says in John 1:18 no man has seen
[44:19] God at any time but the only begotten of
[44:21] the Father which is in the bosom of the
[44:22] father he had declared him right and
[44:25] made him known yes so if you want to
[44:27] know what God is like you look at Jesus
[44:29] Christ amen that's 2,000 years ago but
[44:31] still we have the scriptures we have a
[44:33] history of who he was what he was where
[44:35] did he go and what did he do and but but
[44:38] okay so that was 2,000 years ago but
[44:41] where does God dwell today right he
[44:43] dwells in US amen why is he dwelling in
[44:46] us he wants to declare himself he wants
[44:48] to make himself known he wants to
[44:50] express himself yes well now the only
[44:52] bodies he has like we we read there that
[44:55] you know now we are the Tabernacle that
[44:57] God dwells amen so he wants to live he
[45:00] wants to live his life through us he
[45:01] wants to express himself amen but see
[45:04] the other thing we have to realize is
[45:05] why could why could Jesus Christ why
[45:08] could that body declare who the father
[45:10] was because that body yield itself 100%
[45:13] to the spirit of God that dwelt in him
[45:15] amen amen well yes how is he going to do
[45:18] it to us we have to yield our bodies to
[45:21] him until he has the preeminence he
[45:23] cannot fully Express himself yes amen
[45:26] amen I mean I look at the prophet true I
[45:29] saw Jesus Christ in that Prophet yes I
[45:31] saw God living and expressing himself
[45:34] through that Prophet yes and so that's
[45:36] you know that's just recently I can look
[45:38] at a man in our generation who was born
[45:40] in sin shaped in iniquity come the world
[45:43] speaking Li a man who had a temper like
[45:45] a buz saw as he says a one that God had
[45:47] to lead him to death's door before he
[45:49] would surrender his life over to God and
[45:51] then watch his life as it developed over
[45:53] time from because he was called to be a
[45:56] prophet but yeah you have to look and to
[45:58] see God revealed himself a little here a
[46:00] little there little there a little there
[46:02] until finally we get to the time of the
[46:03] opening of the seals when all of a
[46:05] sudden brother Brown says now there's a
[46:07] there's a message delivered unto me and
[46:09] now I have to be obedient to declare
[46:11] that message yes it's not that the other
[46:14] tapes aren't important I look at brother
[46:17] Brown's life I look at how he how he
[46:18] lived how he acted when he was flying he
[46:21] always flew economy
[46:23] uhhuh I mean okay he didn't want to
[46:26] first class he could have yeah whenever
[46:28] he went whatever he did he always took
[46:30] the lowest place right he always humbled
[46:33] himself he always he never wanted to be
[46:34] regarded as something great he never
[46:36] wanted to be regarded as something
[46:37] important he just wanted to be one of
[46:39] the people amen and because of his
[46:43] humility I'm here again I can look at
[46:45] him and I and I can and I can see
[46:47] him so when we go back and we begin to
[46:49] look at who is Jesus Christ in Isaiah
[46:52] 9:6 run to us a child is born who his
[46:57] child he says unto us a son is given and
[46:59] the Garment shall be upon his shoulder
[47:01] and his name shall be called The
[47:02] Counselor the Mighty God yes the
[47:05] Everlasting father right the Prince of
[47:08] Peace amen when he was born he was God
[47:11] yes unto us a son is going is given who
[47:14] is this son he's the Mighty God he's the
[47:16] Everlasting father yes this is who he
[47:19] was where does that that God live now in
[47:22] us that doesn't make me God that does
[47:24] not make me the Everlasting father it
[47:26] merely makes me a temple in which that
[47:28] God now lives but he wants to express
[47:30] himself amen okay amen true brother
[47:34] Brahman possessing the enemy Gates he
[47:36] said he was the son of God when he was
[47:38] born he was God's virgin born son but
[47:42] when he become the Messiah is when the
[47:43] Holy Spirit Come on him because the
[47:46] Messiah means the anointed one yes never
[47:49] was in living dying and uh buried rising
[47:52] and coming he says there never was a
[47:54] life ever lived like this
[47:56] because he was he was God manifested In
[47:59] the Flesh when he was born he was the
[48:02] expression of what the father of what
[48:04] God the father is and God the father
[48:07] being loved and Jesus was the full
[48:09] expression of love he was L from the
[48:12] very first time that this little baby's
[48:14] hand stroked the pretty cheeks of his
[48:16] mother yes he was led amen and so we
[48:20] don't know anything about his
[48:22] childhood but here we understand that
[48:24] that that
[48:26] we we express the nature of our
[48:29] parents there are actions that I have
[48:32] they can relate that to my dad or my mom
[48:34] right okay and and you know I can't help
[48:38] some of these things because that's part
[48:39] of my genetics right but see in Jesus
[48:42] Christ the only genetics he had was God
[48:45] yes it wasn't part of Joseph and Mary
[48:47] right no it God and God Alone the very
[48:50] genetics of him was nothing but God yes
[48:52] therefore the only thing the only
[48:54] attributes the only nature that he could
[48:56] express was that of God Amen okay so
[48:59] this is where the problem we have I
[49:01] still have a lot of me yes but God is
[49:04] trying to tell me to get out of the way
[49:06] so that he can use me so so he can he
[49:09] can express himself through me amen yes
[49:12] so this nature that I was born with I
[49:14] have to somehow cool it down have it die
[49:17] or whatever the the right word is so
[49:19] that the God can have the preeminence in
[49:21] my life amen amen
[49:24] right
[49:27] at the River Jordan it said that is what
[49:30] brother bam talks about that is when
[49:33] Jesus Christ became the God man in one
[49:36] place in in I think it's the lady of
[49:38] church AG he says Jesus Christ was
[49:40] introduced as the beginning of the
[49:43] creation of God
[49:45] right and and and and he so God and he
[49:48] goes on to say now God is creating
[49:50] himself in in in his bride God the
[49:53] Creator creating himself a part of his
[49:55] creation yes he says this is the true
[49:57] revelation of God Amen so God is
[49:59] creating himself in you yes God forain
[50:04] you from the beginning from from the
[50:06] foundations of The World God knew you
[50:08] you would come he had a purpose for you
[50:10] coming amen and the whole purpose for
[50:12] you coming is so that God could live his
[50:14] life through you so that God could
[50:16] express himself through you yes and why
[50:18] did God send as a prophet so we could
[50:21] understand who we are amen not what
[50:23] we're going to be no Who We Are are now
[50:26] the Bible says now are you the sons of
[50:28] God does not yet appear what you shall
[50:29] be but when he shall appear we'll be
[50:31] like him for we see him as he is amen
[50:34] well there's two ways to look at that
[50:37] when he comes okay and that thing but
[50:39] then to me he came in brother
[50:41] brandom I could see in brother Bram
[50:43] Jesus Christ yes that shows me what I
[50:47] should be like that shows me how I
[50:49] should live that shows me where I should
[50:51] go that tells me how I should act that
[50:53] tells me how I should interact with
[50:54] other people amen right I mean that's
[50:57] that's what I look at brother brass
[50:59] because that's the closest example of
[51:00] Jesus Christ that I have in my
[51:02] generation right
[51:04] amen the church in this condition
[51:07] brother Bron and God said I bear record
[51:09] saying the spirit of God like I dove
[51:11] coming down and abiding on him
[51:13] Hallelujah there you are the Dove and
[51:15] the lamb United together he said that's
[51:17] when God and man became one yes that's
[51:21] when Heaven and Earth Embrace each other
[51:23] Hallelujah that's what God was made
[51:24] flesh
[51:26] um flesh that's when God came down from
[51:29] the spirit form and was made and was
[51:31] made man and dwelt Among Us yes amen and
[51:36] you know I I don't know how other people
[51:38] look at when you receive the Holy
[51:41] Spirit the things that I've been
[51:43] studying and the things that I haven't
[51:45] think I have an understanding
[51:47] of when I was born into this world God
[51:50] placed a seed in
[51:52] me I had to go through my life do
[51:55] different things but there was always
[51:56] God drawing yes but there was a time
[51:59] when all of a sudden God managed to get
[52:02] through to me and I accepted him as my
[52:05] savior amen but then all of a sudden God
[52:08] led me in different ways where I receiv
[52:10] received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[52:11] praise the Lord but then from that point
[52:14] on God God through that spirit that now
[52:17] lives inside of me he's trying to
[52:18] transform me he's trying to change my
[52:20] nature Into His Image yes yes but I I
[52:24] didn't fully I grasp exactly what God
[52:26] was doing and so then all of a sudden
[52:28] God had the Prophet come across my path
[52:32] and and that all of a sudden there was
[52:34] another re Revelation another
[52:36] realization that came that literally I
[52:39] was a part of God from the beginning yes
[52:42] I'm going back to being a part I'm going
[52:45] back to being a manifestation of God
[52:47] Amen right now I have this thing I have
[52:49] to deal with my flesh yeah but see after
[52:52] the after the resurrection or after the
[52:54] changing of the body or however you want
[52:56] to put it all of a sudden I won't have
[52:58] to deal with this amen all of a sudden I
[53:01] will be afraid to worship the way I want
[53:02] to worship I won't have any inhibitions
[53:05] I won't have any drawback no I will be
[53:07] able to enter in so into his spirit and
[53:09] so into his presence that literally then
[53:11] I will be free yes Hallelujah that's
[53:14] that's what I'm looking at
[53:18] amen when when we begin to look at when
[53:21] we begin to look at at at Jesus Christ I
[53:24] mean Jesus Christ went about he he he he
[53:27] healed the sick he he raised the dead he
[53:29] did Miracles and stuff but Jesus Christ
[53:32] he says it's not me who's doing what
[53:35] you're seeing yeah he says it's the
[53:37] father in me amen he does these things
[53:41] yes yes you look at brother Bram he says
[53:43] I was just standing there when he did it
[53:45] that's right I was just sitting there in
[53:46] the on the Ohio River when he came down
[53:49] amen when he's standing up there and
[53:51] he's deserting the thoughts he says
[53:53] God's just using my voice he says I have
[53:55] to listen to the tapes to find out what
[53:57] I said because I have no understanding
[53:59] of any of those things amen so here
[54:02] again but see that's what God's wanting
[54:04] to do through
[54:05] us he wants us to to he wants us to
[54:09] yield ourselves to him such that he can
[54:12] use us in the same way he did Jesus
[54:14] Christ amen the same way he did Peter
[54:15] James and John the same way he did
[54:17] brother bradam now he wants to use us in
[54:21] the same way but he takes the same
[54:23] yielding amen it takes the same yielding
[54:27] yes I mean I listen to different people
[54:29] and I start talking about brother B and
[54:31] they keep trying to elevate
[54:33] him brother R I have nothing to do with
[54:36] this yes right I am merely the
[54:38] mouthpiece that God said right he says I
[54:41] want to just go and be a Trapper I want
[54:43] to go living up in the mountains I'll
[54:44] come down and do whatever God wants I
[54:45] want to go back up to M you know amen
[54:49] but God had a different plan for my life
[54:51] so he had to yield to that yes but here
[54:53] again what is God's plan for your life
[54:56] right I'm not called to be a prophet
[54:58] wouldn't even want to be one yeah I mean
[55:01] what an understanding I mean anyway but
[55:05] when we begin to understand what he had
[55:07] to go through because of the office that
[55:10] he had I wouldn't want that amen I have
[55:13] trouble enough just being a minister of
[55:14] the Gospel yeah because of all there's
[55:17] trials and tribute there's things that
[55:18] come along and and then there's some
[55:20] days you know you you're sitting up
[55:23] Saturday you're trying to find something
[55:24] worth saying
[55:26] and then you stay up till midnight
[55:27] nothing you stay up 2 in the morning
[55:29] nothing I'll go ahead and go to sleep
[55:32] and all of a sudden half an hour before
[55:33] service starts ah now you're finally
[55:35] giving me what you want right very
[55:37] frustrating but anyway but we have to
[55:40] understand what is God trying to
[55:43] do and and and come follow me brother
[55:45] brandom he goes on he says Jesus was the
[55:47] transmitter of God's word uh he was the
[55:51] he he was complete God and complete man
[55:54] amen
[55:56] he goes on in spiritual food and newe
[55:59] season see well I said sure he wept he
[56:02] was both human and divine he was a man
[56:04] weeping but he had to be God to raise
[56:06] the dead that's right he was a man
[56:08] hungry but he was god- feeding 5,000
[56:10] with a couple biscuits and five fishes
[56:13] that's right he was a man sleeping on
[56:14] the back of the boat but it was God in
[56:16] him that could steal the waters why and
[56:19] for why he was the me he and his message
[56:22] were one because he said he said I and
[56:25] my father are one right my father
[56:27] dwelleth in me he was the fullness of
[56:29] the godhead bodily amen yes but see that
[56:32] body that he lived in this this both the
[56:35] human part of Jesus Christ had to
[56:37] completely surrender to the god that
[56:40] dwelt in that body yes amen and and this
[56:43] is the this is the quandry that I find
[56:45] in me and and this is the thing that God
[56:47] has been has been been dealing with me
[56:48] on he says he says
[56:51] yeah this flesh is flesh mhm it's
[56:54] there's very much flesh yeah but there's
[56:57] something else inside of
[56:59] me it's the Divine that's inside of me
[57:03] it's the logos it's the essence of
[57:05] everything that God is that is what's
[57:08] dwelling inside of this Temple amen and
[57:11] that Essence that that logos he wants to
[57:14] take this vessel and now is the time
[57:16] because we are at the end of end of time
[57:19] now is the time when this vessel is
[57:21] supposed to come into the very
[57:22] manifestation and the expression of God
[57:24] himself
[57:25] Amen to do that I have to die right Amen
[57:30] to do that I have to totally yield
[57:32] myself to the god that dwells inside of
[57:34] me true
[57:38] amen it's interesting in John 14 Jesus
[57:42] says I'm you know I'm going to go away
[57:43] or something and anyway Philip says him
[57:45] Lord show me show the father and that'll
[57:47] that'll satisfy us Jesus said in him
[57:51] have I been so long time with you and
[57:53] you don't know who I am
[57:55] um he if you seen me you've seen the
[57:58] father so how sayest in this show us the
[58:00] father believe it's not that I am in the
[58:02] Father the fathers in me the words that
[58:04] I speak un you I speak not of myself but
[58:06] the father that dwelleth in me Heth the
[58:08] word believe me that I am in the father
[58:10] and the fathers in me are believe
[58:12] believe me for the very work's sake and
[58:15] and and and another place it says it
[58:18] says that that day you you will know
[58:20] that how I am in the Father the father
[58:21] is in me brother Brown says that's this
[58:23] day yes yes only this day is the
[58:27] comprehension going to come of how the
[58:30] relationship between Jesus Christ and
[58:32] the father that dwelt in him because
[58:34] that same relationship is now to come to
[58:36] full manifestation and expression in US
[58:39] amen Jesus say I don't do any of these
[58:41] things he says the father who dwells in
[58:44] me he does these things
[58:46] yes right Colossians 2 um and 2 and N
[58:51] for in him dwelt the fullness of the
[58:53] godhead bodily in Hebrews 1 and and
[58:56] three who being the brightness of his
[58:57] glory and the express image of his
[58:59] person and upholding All Things by the
[59:01] word of his power when he had by himself
[59:03] purged our sins sat down at the right
[59:04] hand of the Majesty on high yes so
[59:08] brother BR is expressing all of this and
[59:10] the scriptures expressing Jesus Christ
[59:12] was the very image and manifestation of
[59:15] of God himself amen
[59:18] okay and in John 10 starting at 27 Jesus
[59:23] said my sheep hear my voice and I know
[59:25] them and they follow me and I give unto
[59:27] them eternal life and they shall never
[59:29] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[59:32] out of my hand now there's our security
[59:34] yes I mean all all my mistakes and
[59:37] everything I mean he knew what I was
[59:38] going to be from the beginning amen and
[59:41] I was born he knew every mistake I was
[59:43] going to make he knows every mistake
[59:45] I'll make in the future knowing all of
[59:47] that he was still willing to die for me
[59:49] yes why because I was a part of him from
[59:51] the beginning praise the Lord I always
[59:54] was his child praise God so he came to
[59:56] redeem back that which was a part of
[59:58] himself amen and therefore I don't
[1:00:00] struggle with a lot of these other
[1:00:01] things you know why would God blessed me
[1:00:03] because I his
[1:00:04] child that's right I I'm his wife okay
[1:00:08] um he he's my father I I understand him
[1:00:11] as a father I understand him as a friend
[1:00:14] I also understand him as God yes you
[1:00:16] know all all of these different
[1:00:17] relationships that that we have but it
[1:00:19] comes to the place where okay I'm
[1:00:22] beginning to understand who I am in
[1:00:25] Jesus Christ yes and Jesus says and and
[1:00:29] Jesus
[1:00:29] says my Father which gave them me is
[1:00:32] greater than all and no man can is able
[1:00:34] to pluck them out of my hand and he says
[1:00:36] I and my father were
[1:00:38] one and then they were going to take him
[1:00:40] out and get rid of them uhuh okay
[1:00:43] yeah but see that applies to us
[1:00:48] sure I mean really this is where I mean
[1:00:51] this is the thing that I I I struggle
[1:00:53] with yes this this is this is what this
[1:00:55] applies to me see we are to be when in
[1:00:58] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:01:00] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:01:01] mystery of God is going to be
[1:01:03] finished we are that mystery
[1:01:07] yes we are the mystery of God we are God
[1:01:10] is going to come and so possess the
[1:01:12] bride yes until the bride literally
[1:01:15] becomes the full manifestation the
[1:01:16] expression of God praise the Lord how it
[1:01:19] all is going to play out I don't know
[1:01:21] all I know is this is what he has said
[1:01:23] amen because he he he he has mentioned
[1:01:27] in another
[1:01:28] place so he does not air with the
[1:01:31] sh but then come P the Pentecost the
[1:01:34] restoration of the gifts speaking in
[1:01:36] tongues they call it the initial
[1:01:37] evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[1:01:39] tongues there but they call that the
[1:01:41] initial evidence which brought forth the
[1:01:43] what the
[1:01:44] shock but they denominated yeah but when
[1:01:48] you come to say I and my father are
[1:01:50] one all these other things that's when
[1:01:53] the Shar pulls away
[1:01:55] right but the real genuine bride church
[1:01:58] will bring forth the entire word of God
[1:02:00] in his fullness and in his strength for
[1:02:02] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:02:05] forever praise the Lord amen the bride
[1:02:07] has to come to the understanding and the
[1:02:09] Revelation that I and my father were the
[1:02:12] same amen but Jesus could say that
[1:02:15] because he was the full expression he
[1:02:18] could say that because that God that
[1:02:20] dwelt in him had total preeminence yes
[1:02:23] and until that God has a total
[1:02:24] preeminence in us we cannot say that
[1:02:27] amen I can say yeah the L God dwells in
[1:02:30] me and I yield myself into him and he
[1:02:32] speaks through me or does actions or
[1:02:33] whatever the thing of it is but if it
[1:02:35] ever can come to the place where I give
[1:02:37] that God the total pre preeminence in my
[1:02:40] life where literally he has absolute
[1:02:43] control I cannot say I and my father are
[1:02:46] one yes but that's where he said this is
[1:02:48] where the bride is coming
[1:02:50] to he says he says and now the church is
[1:02:53] uniting itself to the body of Christ yes
[1:02:56] it's got it it's it's got itself free
[1:02:58] cut away from every little fed getting
[1:03:01] itself ready getting together Union
[1:03:02] among them oh I love enjy the Holy
[1:03:05] Spirit moving among them oh my what a
[1:03:07] time yes he says for looking the uniting
[1:03:09] time is at hand for God is getting the
[1:03:11] church together to be a Rapture to go to
[1:03:14] the wedding of the great Union amen when
[1:03:16] when God and man will unite for eternity
[1:03:20] then creatures of time Unite with
[1:03:22] eternal and he had to give his life to
[1:03:25] bring about a power to unite other men
[1:03:27] with the same power for the Bride of
[1:03:30] Jesus Christ and now the church is
[1:03:31] uniting itself to the body yes and this
[1:03:35] is where we are at in
[1:03:37] time we're there amen the end time is
[1:03:41] not Future No it's here part of this
[1:03:44] amen the Earth is under judgment the
[1:03:46] world is under judgment you know I mean
[1:03:48] just just look around amen okay so where
[1:03:51] should the bride be if if we're still
[1:03:54] fooling around with the world if we're
[1:03:56] still looking at worldly things if we
[1:03:58] still got our head in the in the idiot
[1:03:59] box if we're sitting and feeding on all
[1:04:02] the garbage of the world and that's our
[1:04:04] focus of Our Lives then then where are
[1:04:06] we at until we lay aside the world and
[1:04:09] the things of the world until we take
[1:04:11] all of that garbage and lay all of that
[1:04:12] aside and make our Focus Jesus Christ
[1:04:15] amen where Jesus Christ becomes the very
[1:04:18] central theme of our life until we can
[1:04:21] do that then he cannot do what he wants
[1:04:23] to do through us right
[1:04:27] amen because in him was life and the
[1:04:29] life was the light of men the light
[1:04:32] shine is in the darkness the darkness
[1:04:34] comprehended it
[1:04:35] not he said for God so loved the world
[1:04:38] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:04:40] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:04:41] perish but have everlasting life yes for
[1:04:44] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:04:46] condemn the world but that the world
[1:04:48] through him might be saved yes he that
[1:04:50] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[1:04:53] that believeth not is is condemned
[1:04:54] already because he had not believed in
[1:04:56] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[1:04:58] right and this is the
[1:05:00] condemnation that light is come into the
[1:05:02] world and Men love Darkness rather than
[1:05:05] light because their deeds were evil Amen
[1:05:09] in Jesus Christ was a
[1:05:12] life the life that was in him was God
[1:05:17] right that was the light the life of God
[1:05:19] that was to shine out to the rest of the
[1:05:22] world Amen Where is the that life
[1:05:25] now in US amen right are you a five wat
[1:05:30] bulb are you a 5,000 what B amen yeah
[1:05:34] how much of it are you letting shine
[1:05:36] right like in India I ask him you know
[1:05:39] where you know where does God dwell oh
[1:05:41] he dwells in my heart I say were you
[1:05:44] ever going to let him
[1:05:46] out yeah are you ever going to sit there
[1:05:48] and allow him to express himself through
[1:05:51] you right amen because until you do that
[1:05:53] you got him locked up in an i cute
[1:05:55] little box that you carry him around no
[1:05:57] he needs to be released amen and that's
[1:06:00] what the message came to tell us prise
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:04] Lord yes we all we all have our concept
[1:06:08] of what God
[1:06:09] is I mean when this is when I started
[1:06:11] this study you know what was
[1:06:13] God God the Father yeah the spirit that
[1:06:16] dwelt you know he led the children of
[1:06:18] Israel and all this kind of good stuff
[1:06:20] and that was nice he came in mzc he
[1:06:22] revealed himself to Abraham yeah we see
[1:06:26] in the Psalms we see that you know David
[1:06:28] wrote A Psalm down and described the
[1:06:31] crucifixion and we look in Isaiah and
[1:06:32] here again we have more things then we
[1:06:35] see this man we call Jesus Christ this
[1:06:37] body God lived in he did all these
[1:06:39] Miracles and wonders and all that kind
[1:06:41] of stuff that was 2,000 years ago amen
[1:06:44] oh now now that God and here again we
[1:06:47] the spirit of God now that spirit of God
[1:06:50] is coming and dwelling in US yes well
[1:06:53] you here again that's why I related now
[1:06:55] it's the logos amen it's the very
[1:06:58] essence of everything God
[1:07:01] is on the day of Pentecost what did that
[1:07:04] light do that that logos it came and it
[1:07:07] separated itself and began to live in
[1:07:09] every one of the disciples amen right
[1:07:12] and then when the other ones were
[1:07:13] baptized what would happen when the Holy
[1:07:15] Spirit comes on what is the holy spirit
[1:07:17] it's the logos yes amen that's what came
[1:07:20] and dwelt in them that's right so what
[1:07:22] do I have in me
[1:07:24] I have that lust and I'm just beginning
[1:07:27] to comprehend that all that God is I
[1:07:29] have access to amen but I don't have
[1:07:32] access to it for my own benefit right I
[1:07:36] have access to it to benefit others amen
[1:07:39] it's not about me it's not about you
[1:07:42] that's right it's not what you do for
[1:07:44] God it's what you allow God to do
[1:07:45] through you amen and and this is where
[1:07:47] we have to come to the comprehension
[1:07:49] this is where we have to come to an
[1:07:51] understanding at least this is this is
[1:07:52] my opinion
[1:07:54] we have to understand what God is and
[1:07:56] where God lives he that cometh to God
[1:07:59] must believe that he is yes what do you
[1:08:02] believe he is some wimpy little person
[1:08:06] that doesn't have you know can't get out
[1:08:07] of bed in the morning and oh I didn't
[1:08:09] know that was going to happen oh wow
[1:08:11] this is oh this is terrible I didn't
[1:08:13] realize this was going to happen the
[1:08:15] world oh man what should I do what
[1:08:17] should I do what should I to some people
[1:08:20] that's their God yeah yes that's true
[1:08:22] Amen to me God predestinated all this
[1:08:25] from the beginning sure why was there Co
[1:08:29] there had to be Co to bring about the
[1:08:31] change in the world system so that all
[1:08:33] of a sudden people would you know people
[1:08:35] would would not rely upon this that or
[1:08:37] the other and since Co has happened all
[1:08:39] of a sudden I find a lot of people who
[1:08:41] used to go to church sit at home in you
[1:08:44] know in their pajamas with their coffee
[1:08:46] cup and their donuts and said let's see
[1:08:48] who's on today oh I don't like him no
[1:08:51] let's let's check let's try this church
[1:08:53] mhm I know I disagree with him maybe
[1:08:56] this one here would be better that's
[1:08:59] right I mean that's what's going on Amen
[1:09:01] right go to church and leave the comfort
[1:09:04] of my easy chair and my coffee and my
[1:09:06] donut oh man no you here that's that's
[1:09:09] asking way too much yeah come on this is
[1:09:14] a reality amen this is the reality yes
[1:09:18] anyway
[1:09:22] true
[1:09:24] another thing I found interesting when I
[1:09:26] was doing the study looking at Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ we understand Jesus Christ was
[1:09:31] was both he was complete God and
[1:09:34] complete man okay he was both human and
[1:09:38] divine but we understand that Jesus
[1:09:41] Christ was the second
[1:09:43] Adam he had to succeed where the first
[1:09:46] Adam failed yes when Adam was created he
[1:09:51] was a Son of God yes the only genetic
[1:09:54] makeup he could have in him was it was
[1:09:58] was genetics of God yes there wasn't any
[1:10:01] Hatter there wasn't any malice amen okay
[1:10:05] God took Adam and he put La him on free
[1:10:07] moral
[1:10:07] agency brother bradam says you have to
[1:10:10] will to do the will of God right it's a
[1:10:14] it's a decision and he says that puts us
[1:10:16] back into the garden
[1:10:18] again you have to will to do God's will
[1:10:22] amen you can choose yes or God's way or
[1:10:26] your way true true and you make that
[1:10:29] decision 100 times a day
[1:10:32] right but the thing that I that I that I
[1:10:35] was looking at when I got into that okay
[1:10:38] so God now dwelt in this Temple of clay
[1:10:42] called we call Jesus Christ when he was
[1:10:45] born the very nature within him was God
[1:10:48] well that's the way Adam was my
[1:10:50] opinion but now all of a sudden God was
[1:10:53] dwelling God came on on on in the River
[1:10:55] Jordan and God in fullness came and
[1:10:57] dwelt within this Temple we called Jesus
[1:11:00] Christ amen it was the temple there was
[1:11:03] the tabernacle that Adam was living in
[1:11:06] that caused his fall yes would Jesus
[1:11:10] also fall because of the Tabernacle he
[1:11:14] lived in
[1:11:16] right why is it after why is it after he
[1:11:20] was baptized in the fullness came why
[1:11:22] did he have to go into the Wilderness
[1:11:24] and be
[1:11:26] tempted I
[1:11:27] mean to me in some regards this doesn't
[1:11:30] make a whole lot of sense but it comes
[1:11:33] down here again I'm just looking at this
[1:11:36] it talks about in Hebrews for we have
[1:11:37] not a high priest which cannot be
[1:11:39] touched with the feeling of our
[1:11:40] infirmities amen but was not always
[1:11:42] tempted right like as you are yes 1
[1:11:46] Corinthians 10:3 there is no temptation
[1:11:49] you taken you but what is common to man
[1:11:52] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[1:11:53] you to be tempted above what you're able
[1:11:55] but will with the Temptation make a way
[1:11:57] of Escape amen James 1:13 let no man say
[1:12:00] when he is tempted I'm tempted of God
[1:12:02] for God cannot be tempted with evil
[1:12:04] neither tempteth he any man but every
[1:12:07] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[1:12:09] his own lust and entice and what lust
[1:12:11] hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and
[1:12:12] sin when it have when it is finished
[1:12:14] bringeth forth death yes amen Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ was all
[1:12:19] man and all God yes so how this all God
[1:12:24] that dwelt in this all man how would it
[1:12:27] live how would it conduct
[1:12:30] itself Jesus Christ was the was was he
[1:12:33] he he was the word made flesh yes he was
[1:12:36] the one in the logos form he was the one
[1:12:38] that created all things he was the one
[1:12:40] that had all these powers and all this
[1:12:42] other stuff amen he laid that
[1:12:46] aside so that he could come and die on a
[1:12:49] cross for our sins right we go in there
[1:12:51] in Matthew 4 in 1 through1 11 it begin
[1:12:54] here Jesus here Satan was tempting him
[1:12:57] he says you're hungry you haven't eaten
[1:13:00] for 40
[1:13:02] days if you're the Son of God prove it
[1:13:07] take these Stones turn them into bread
[1:13:09] use it for your own benefit right you're
[1:13:11] hungry you can do this if you're the Son
[1:13:14] Of God Speak it'll happen amen he said
[1:13:18] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:13:20] every word that comes out of bone yes
[1:13:24] so then he takes him up to to the
[1:13:25] Pinnacle of the temple see all those
[1:13:28] people down there
[1:13:30] jump the angel it's written the angels
[1:13:33] will come and make sure that you don't
[1:13:35] even stumble and fall right don't even
[1:13:37] Dash your foot against the
[1:13:39] stor manifest yourself glorify yourself
[1:13:42] in the eyes of the people when all these
[1:13:45] angels come down to your rescue and all
[1:13:47] these people wow look at this a whole
[1:13:50] host of angels come down and here he's
[1:13:52] descending and they're gently lowering
[1:13:54] him down oh man manifest yourself
[1:13:56] Express Yourself prove who you
[1:13:59] are Jesus says you don't live you don't
[1:14:01] tempt God
[1:14:04] Amen if God said for me to jump yeah I
[1:14:07] could have jumped sure but God did not
[1:14:09] tell me I could jump amen God did not
[1:14:12] tell me I could take the stones and turn
[1:14:13] them into bread hallelujah amen and he
[1:14:16] takes them up up and he shows them all
[1:14:18] the kingdoms of the world even today's
[1:14:21] Kingdom worship me I'll give you all of
[1:14:24] this bypass the cross right because if
[1:14:27] you're the Son of God if you came to
[1:14:29] redeem mankind he says you're going to
[1:14:30] have to die on a cross in order to bring
[1:14:33] Redemption to the people
[1:14:35] yes dying is not fun especially on a
[1:14:39] cross yeah just worship me I'll give you
[1:14:42] all this cast the cross amen he said
[1:14:47] no he says it's written he says Thou
[1:14:49] shal Worship the Lord thy God and him
[1:14:51] only shalt thou serve amen yeah yes but
[1:14:54] see what have what have men done all of
[1:14:56] a sudden they get positions of
[1:14:58] authority and I'm the pastor of the
[1:15:01] church people look up to me brother

[1:15:06] that will destroy men money

[1:15:14] too many of them one two or combination
[1:15:18] yes right
[1:15:20] amen and this is it is a temptation
[1:15:23] you cannot say that it's not right right
[1:15:27] and so how do you remain humble right
[1:15:29] look at the
[1:15:31] prophet he didn't even want brand tab to
[1:15:33] be named Bram Tabernacle amen right he
[1:15:36] doesn't want anything he says when I'm G
[1:15:39] I don't want people to remember me all I
[1:15:41] want them to do is remember the Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ that I serve right amen amen do
[1:15:46] you want money somebody gave him a
[1:15:48] cashier check for I think a million and
[1:15:50] a half he says I don't do what I do for
[1:15:52] money yeah here take it
[1:15:55] amen he could have lived like a rich man
[1:15:58] sure okay I mean here I mean this is
[1:16:01] this is what I see there was The
[1:16:03] Temptations brother bradam overcame all
[1:16:05] of them
[1:16:06] amen okay how are we
[1:16:10] doing and that's the only qu that the
[1:16:13] only one that can answer that is
[1:16:14] yourself amen
[1:16:19] right Jesus Christ overcame Satan the
[1:16:23] word
[1:16:25] yesman identified Masterpiece of God he
[1:16:28] says oh Christian friend put on the
[1:16:29] whole armor of God don't stand back with
[1:16:32] some little idea of some creat or
[1:16:34] something that you're standing by put on
[1:16:36] the whole armor of God yes when you go
[1:16:38] to fight against the enemy like our Lord
[1:16:40] did he showed that how the weakest of
[1:16:43] Christians can defeat Satan just with
[1:16:45] the word he had powers he could have
[1:16:48] smoked Satan any way he wanted to but he
[1:16:50] didn't use it amen he just took the word
[1:16:53] word and defeated him and defeated him
[1:16:55] with it it's written it's written it's
[1:16:58] written so he defeated Satan by the word
[1:17:01] of God right amen how do we defeat
[1:17:05] him I'm not feeling good so you told me
[1:17:10] your stripes by your stripes like you
[1:17:11] healed me already right okay so I'm
[1:17:15] Healed
[1:17:16] yes you don't feel like it heing doesn't
[1:17:19] matter what the word says
[1:17:22] amen during that in Satan's face right
[1:17:25] you're trying to make me sick I don't
[1:17:26] want to be sick I got too many things to
[1:17:29] do Satan go away
[1:17:31] amen God you said you promise your in
[1:17:34] God you you you will you cannot lie amen
[1:17:40] if it's written in the word you have to
[1:17:42] stand by Your Word yes and so if that's
[1:17:45] a promise and I have to make it to me
[1:17:48] yes by his CH we are healed right well
[1:17:51] that sounds nice but until you AB his
[1:17:54] right I am healed now that becomes the
[1:17:57] difference yes because now it's a
[1:17:59] binding contract between God and you
[1:18:02] that's right God you told me I was
[1:18:05] healed amen and therefore I am doesn't
[1:18:08] matter what I feel like doesn't matter
[1:18:09] the symptom so I might have to go to bed
[1:18:11] for three or four days and sleep and
[1:18:13] give my body the chance to recover
[1:18:14] itself that's fine however you want to
[1:18:16] do it but you've already healed me amen
[1:18:19] that's what I'm invting yes sir but see
[1:18:21] this is what we have to come to
[1:18:24] this is where we as Christians as the
[1:18:26] Bride of Jesus Christ we have to realize
[1:18:28] where does God live amen where does God
[1:18:31] dwell he dwells in me well if that God
[1:18:33] if the if the essence of everything God
[1:18:35] is dwells in me I have access to
[1:18:37] everything he is yes amen all I have to
[1:18:41] do is I guess for lack of a better word
[1:18:44] remind him of the promise he made to me
[1:18:47] yes
[1:18:49] amen true when we begin to look at at
[1:18:52] how how did God how did Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] live and how did he act in Philippians
[1:18:58] uh two it says look not every man on his
[1:19:00] own things but every man also in the
[1:19:01] things of others yes let this mind be in
[1:19:04] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[1:19:06] being the very form the very image the
[1:19:08] very essence the brightness of of of his
[1:19:11] being and all this other type stuff that
[1:19:13] we just read who being in the form of
[1:19:16] God and that's what he was thought it
[1:19:17] not robbery to be equal with God Amen he
[1:19:20] had all this power did he he he claimed
[1:19:24] to be a Son of God right this is how you
[1:19:27] you're claim if you're claiming to be a
[1:19:28] Son of God you're making yourself equal
[1:19:30] with God that's what the told him yes
[1:19:33] but he says that's what I am right I'm
[1:19:36] equal with my
[1:19:37] father
[1:19:39] okay he goes on but he made himself of
[1:19:41] no reputation he emptied himself and
[1:19:43] took upon him the form of a servant was
[1:19:46] made the likeness of men and being found
[1:19:48] in Fashions of man he humbled himself
[1:19:49] and became obedient to death even the
[1:19:51] death of the cross amen yes but Rob not
[1:19:55] robbery to be equal with
[1:19:57] God precisely because he was in the form
[1:20:00] of God he reced equality with God not a
[1:20:02] matter of
[1:20:03] getting but of giving amen amen right
[1:20:06] God so loved the world he gave praise
[1:20:09] the Lord amen you need healing you don't
[1:20:12] earn
[1:20:13] it he gave amen you need a
[1:20:16] job you asked Lord I'm I'm I need a job
[1:20:20] I need work I need he gives amen he
[1:20:25] brings this to pass and this to pass and
[1:20:27] this to pass and all of a sudden what's
[1:20:28] he doing he's leading you where he wants
[1:20:31] you employed right because he has a
[1:20:34] reason why he where he wants you true
[1:20:38] okay this is my opinion obvious that's
[1:20:45] right it says here he emptied himself he
[1:20:48] laid aside the form of God his deity and
[1:20:51] took on him the form the complete
[1:20:52] characteristics of a slave of a person
[1:20:55] with no Advantage with no rights or
[1:20:58] privileges of his own
[1:21:00] amen if and if you if you are a
[1:21:05] slave you have no rights amen your boss
[1:21:09] your the your owner is the one who
[1:21:12] dictates what you're going to do where I
[1:21:14] was in the Army um yeah I was a slave I
[1:21:18] don't know how else you're going to put
[1:21:19] it I don't want to go shoot somebody you
[1:21:22] know
[1:21:23] oh no you got to get up you got to do pt
[1:21:25] it's 4:00 in the morning I want my sleep
[1:21:28] I don't care what you want get out of
[1:21:30] bed we're going to go down there we got
[1:21:31] to do our physical exercise yeah I'm GNA
[1:21:34] have to run how much with a pack on my
[1:21:37] back come on man you're crazy he says
[1:21:39] you're a slave you will do what I have
[1:21:42] told you to do yes amen I learned that
[1:21:45] in basic training you have no mind of
[1:21:47] your own when they say jump you ask how
[1:21:49] high right okay but see in the same way
[1:21:53] it comes down to us in our relationship
[1:21:55] with God Paul was a slave to God a loved
[1:21:58] slave praise the Lord he went wherever
[1:22:00] God led him and directed him he would
[1:22:03] not speak because this lady was
[1:22:05] bothering him saying follow this you
[1:22:07] know and he had to wait for God to give
[1:22:10] him the command yes before he could cast
[1:22:12] it out
[1:22:13] amen yes well brother Bradon was a slave
[1:22:18] mhm amen all of a sudden God would say I
[1:22:20] want you to go into a certain certain
[1:22:22] town I want you to be at a certain CC
[1:22:23] counter you have to be there exactly
[1:22:26] 7:32 sharp and this person's going to
[1:22:29] come by this is how they're going to be
[1:22:30] dressed they have this ailment or this
[1:22:32] problem you are to pray for that person
[1:22:34] and then hi tail it out of
[1:22:36] town so it's 1032 or whatever I time him
[1:22:40] again all of a sudden he was there he
[1:22:43] knew he had to be there at that specific
[1:22:46] time amen because only at that specific
[1:22:49] time would that person come and only at
[1:22:52] that specific time would he be able to
[1:22:54] minister to that person yes so he would
[1:22:57] sit there and I don't know he didn't
[1:22:58] elaborate on what he did all I know is
[1:23:00] that he prayed for the person and then
[1:23:02] he left right and she turned around the
[1:23:05] person right
[1:23:06] heal he did not want to glorify himself
[1:23:10] amen I came at fitting because God told
[1:23:12] me to right well this is where we have
[1:23:16] to
[1:23:17] come but see Jesus Christ he prayed
[1:23:21] often
[1:23:23] so that he would know what the will of
[1:23:24] the father was that dwelt in him right
[1:23:27] Amen brother Brandon was a man of prayer
[1:23:30] because he had to know what God wanted
[1:23:33] him to do right he had to follow that
[1:23:36] leadership he had to follow that
[1:23:37] guidance amen well now it comes down to
[1:23:41] us yes what are we supposed to be doing
[1:23:45] we have to have an intimate personal
[1:23:47] relationship with Jesus Christ amen so
[1:23:50] that he can lead us he can guide us and
[1:23:52] he can direct us amen amen
[1:23:55] right it's interesting when when when
[1:23:58] when when Jesus
[1:24:00] Christ um in in in in in Luke the four
[1:24:04] fourth chapter it was delivered unto
[1:24:07] Jesus Christ the book of Isaiah when he
[1:24:09] open the book he found the place where
[1:24:10] it written the spirit of the Lord is is
[1:24:13] upon me
[1:24:16] because this is the reason why the
[1:24:18] spirit of God is on me there's a reason
[1:24:22] why
[1:24:22] I am here there is a reason why God's
[1:24:25] spirit is on me amen he hath anointed me
[1:24:28] to preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:24:30] sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach
[1:24:32] Deliverance to the captives recovering
[1:24:33] sight to the blind set Liberty to them
[1:24:35] their are bruis and to preach acceptable
[1:24:37] year of the Lord
[1:24:38] amen that the anointing was on him for a
[1:24:42] specific purpose yes amen that has not
[1:24:47] changed we are his body amen why is his
[1:24:52] spirit Spirit on us to fulfill what the
[1:24:55] spirit of Lord is upon me because okay
[1:24:59] that has never changed amen it will not
[1:25:02] change until I get the changing in my
[1:25:03] body and all of a sudden then we get to
[1:25:05] go into the Millennium and then all
[1:25:07] Everything Will Change then yes but we
[1:25:10] hear again why do we he why are we
[1:25:12] supposed to be
[1:25:13] doing brother randam in in in uh that
[1:25:17] day on
[1:25:18] Calvary he was just just one man the
[1:25:21] perfect man he gave gave his life and he
[1:25:23] made an example for you now the first
[1:25:26] thing I want to say is this Jesus never
[1:25:28] lived for himself he lived his life was
[1:25:31] spent for others yes that's perfectly
[1:25:34] eternal life when you say you're going
[1:25:36] to go to church and do good thing it's
[1:25:39] fine but when you live your life to
[1:25:42] yourself you haven't eternal life
[1:25:44] eternal life is living for others yes it
[1:25:48] proved it when he come in the Lamb of
[1:25:50] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:25:52] because he did not live for himself he
[1:25:54] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:25:57] life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:25:59] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:26:02] others amen someone said how can you
[1:26:04] stand and let anybody call you such bad
[1:26:07] names he says you don't live for
[1:26:09] yourself you live for others yes that
[1:26:12] you might redeem that man you be you
[1:26:15] become Sons you are Sons you don't live
[1:26:17] for yourself you live for others amen
[1:26:19] well brother bam I can live for this
[1:26:21] brother because he sure such a nice
[1:26:23] man that's not it live for the man who
[1:26:26] hates you yes live for the person who
[1:26:28] kill you if they could that's what they
[1:26:31] done to him they killed him and he died
[1:26:33] that he might that he died that he might
[1:26:35] save them that's eternal life when you
[1:26:38] get that in your bosom you're facing
[1:26:39] heaven then amen you sacrifice your own
[1:26:42] things and you give like a sheep does
[1:26:44] its
[1:26:46] W and this is some of that I mean here
[1:26:49] again this is the cont this is never
[1:26:51] preached I don't hear very
[1:26:53] often but we have to understand what is
[1:26:57] where does God live today he lives in
[1:26:59] his body that body amen why why why is
[1:27:02] he anointing to fulfill the same thing
[1:27:04] he did through his son that commission
[1:27:06] has not changed that Comm all the way
[1:27:08] through the book of Acts that's exactly
[1:27:10] what they were doing amen this is what
[1:27:12] brother bradam
[1:27:13] did that's what we're supposed to be
[1:27:15] doing yes okay and then like I say I
[1:27:18] look at the life of brother bradam he
[1:27:20] didn't live for himself right
[1:27:22] I mean he could he could have been he
[1:27:25] could have been a multi-millionaire sure
[1:27:27] he said I don't want to amen he lived in
[1:27:30] a humble Little Shack he drove a Ford
[1:27:34] station wagon and not the top of the
[1:27:37] line you know he could have been
[1:27:38] Mercedes it could have been you know
[1:27:40] Lincoln you know no just a standard
[1:27:43] board yeah okay that's what he like
[1:27:46] that's fine I I drive a Honda so I'm not
[1:27:48] in the message okay but we have to begin
[1:27:51] to understand
[1:27:52] why what was he doing what I I see God
[1:27:56] manifesting his his life through that
[1:27:58] man yes because literally he gave his
[1:28:01] life for to everything that he had he
[1:28:04] gave away yes so that somebody else
[1:28:06] could benefit amen true it's interesting
[1:28:11] when when Jesus Christ began to talk
[1:28:13] exhort his
[1:28:15] disciples in Mark 9 it says and he came
[1:28:17] to capernium and being in the house he
[1:28:19] asked them what was that you just
[1:28:22] amongst yourselves as we walked along
[1:28:23] the way but they held their peace for by
[1:28:26] the way they disput among them among
[1:28:28] themselves who's going to be the
[1:28:30] greatest he sat down and called the 12
[1:28:33] and said unto them if any man desire to
[1:28:35] be the first the same shall be last of
[1:28:37] all and the servant of all yeah amen
[1:28:41] Mark 10 when the 10 heard it James and
[1:28:44] John when the 10 heard it they began to
[1:28:46] be much displeased with James and John
[1:28:49] but Jesus called them to him and said to
[1:28:51] him you know that they which are
[1:28:53] accounted to rule over the Gentiles
[1:28:55] exercise lordship over them and their
[1:28:58] great ones exercise Authority upon
[1:29:01] them but so shall it not be among you
[1:29:03] but whosoever will be great among you
[1:29:06] shall be your minister yes whosoever
[1:29:08] will be the chiefest shall be the
[1:29:10] servant of all even as the son of man
[1:29:12] came not to be ministered unto but to
[1:29:14] minister and to give his life for ransom
[1:29:16] for many and first Peter Peter was
[1:29:19] giving an
[1:29:20] exhortation he say the elders which are
[1:29:22] among you I exhort who are also an elder
[1:29:24] and a witness of the sufferings of
[1:29:26] Christ and also a partaker of the glory
[1:29:28] which shall be revealed feed the flock
[1:29:30] of God which is among you take the
[1:29:31] oversight there not by constraint but
[1:29:35] willingly yes not for filthy lcer but of
[1:29:38] a ready mind yes neither being as Lords
[1:29:41] over God's Heritage but being examples
[1:29:44] to the FL amen you witness what you you
[1:29:48] you you should live the life as a
[1:29:51] minister you should live the life before
[1:29:53] others as an example of how they should
[1:29:56] live amen that's how brother brandham
[1:29:58] lived right he's the example yes you
[1:30:00] want to know how you should live and
[1:30:02] conduct and stuff look at the look at
[1:30:04] the prophet yes amen
[1:30:12] okay see this shall not be a of the sh
[1:30:15] brother bam he makes a statement like at
[1:30:18] the beginning God dwelt alone because he
[1:30:21] was eternal one
[1:30:22] wasn't even God God was an object of
[1:30:24] worship and the logos as we call it the
[1:30:27] word that went out of God that that that
[1:30:30] that's what Jesus Christ was and when
[1:30:33] that logos was made flesh and dwelt
[1:30:35] Among Us and he says and now as he gave
[1:30:37] his life for us then his Spirit comes
[1:30:39] back upon us and Jesus says at that day
[1:30:41] you'll know that I'm in the Father the
[1:30:43] father's in me and I in you see all see
[1:30:45] is God all along God manifesting himself
[1:30:48] working himself through different ages
[1:30:51] so those three of the Father the Son the
[1:30:53] Holy Spirit same God working in three
[1:30:55] different offices yes
[1:30:57] Amen in John 14 it say I will not leave
[1:31:00] you comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:31:04] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:31:05] more but you shall see me because I live
[1:31:08] you shall live also yes at that day
[1:31:10] you'll know that I in the Father the
[1:31:11] father you in me and I in you and
[1:31:13] brother Brown says that this
[1:31:15] day and going on in Matthew 5 it says ye
[1:31:18] are the light of the world city that's
[1:31:21] rest set on a hill cannot be hid neither
[1:31:23] do men light a candle put it in a bushel
[1:31:26] but on a Candlestick and it giveth light
[1:31:28] unto all men that are in the house let
[1:31:30] your light so shine before men that they
[1:31:32] may see your good works and glorify the
[1:31:34] Father which is in heaven and this is
[1:31:37] the problem that we have if we live it
[1:31:38] if if we continue to live in the world
[1:31:41] and do the things of the world the light
[1:31:42] of God cannot shine because they say
[1:31:45] well there's no difference between you
[1:31:47] and me right why why should I why should
[1:31:50] I forsake what I'm enjoying I'm living
[1:31:53] in the darkness yeah and I like living
[1:31:55] in the darkness I like doing drugs I
[1:31:58] like committing adultery I like stealing
[1:32:00] I like doing all this nasty you what we
[1:32:02] consider nasty things yeah I like doing
[1:32:04] this that's my
[1:32:06] nature and look at you you know better
[1:32:10] than I am yeah you have some shady deals
[1:32:12] when you have your business well okay
[1:32:14] you're stealing from them and places you
[1:32:16] frequent and
[1:32:18] okay but if we take our lives and we set
[1:32:21] them
[1:32:22] side and we dedicate ourselves fully
[1:32:25] unto God will we become holy and
[1:32:28] righteous in the eyes of people not
[1:32:31] because we're we're trying to to look at
[1:32:34] how holy I am look at how righteous I am
[1:32:38] that's
[1:32:39] nonsense excuse me but we begin to we
[1:32:43] just live it yes why do we live
[1:32:46] it because that's our nature yes we
[1:32:50] automatically should be to one another
[1:32:52] we automatically should consider the
[1:32:54] person we should automatic why because
[1:32:57] that's the nature of God itself and that
[1:32:59] nature of God so is supposed to so live
[1:33:02] in in us until it's no longer I who live
[1:33:04] but now it's Christ now living in and
[1:33:06] through
[1:33:07] me and this is where we should be coming
[1:33:10] that's right the message was not given
[1:33:12] to us to
[1:33:14] argue no I have this Revelation you
[1:33:17] don't just agree with me I cut you

[1:33:34] either but I mean here but this is what
[1:33:36] I see with going on yeah I mean a lot of
[1:33:40] these doctrinal points are irrelevant
[1:33:42] yeah amen you
[1:33:45] know you know brother Ram says some
[1:33:48] think he's coming on a white cloud some
[1:33:50] think he's coming on a white horse
[1:33:52] and they'll separate and divide right he
[1:33:55] said but at least you believe he's
[1:33:58] coming amen I mean but see here again
[1:34:01] there have there should be more Unity
[1:34:03] there should be more love there should

[1:34:10] yeah because we're all we if we are all
[1:34:13] the body of Jesus Christ and the Very
[1:34:16] nature of that God should be being

[1:34:29] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:34:30] that God is light and in him is no
[1:34:32] Darkness at all if we say have
[1:34:34] fellowship with him and walk in darkness

[1:34:38] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:34:40] light we have Fellowship one one with

[1:43:45] because that's not who I am yes I'm
[1:43:49] happy with who I I am because I'm living
[1:43:52] the life that God manifested for me to
[1:43:54] live I'm a sheep so I live the life of a
[1:43:58] sheep and I'm happy that way because
[1:44:00] that's who I am yes praise the Lord
[1:44:03] that's why I don't get on people all the
[1:44:05] time and stuff and uh you know they
[1:44:08] drink and smoke and whatever they do and
[1:44:10] we hired a new guy on the job and he's
[1:44:12] nice guy but he smokes like crazy and
[1:44:15] just just who he is you know uh the Lord
[1:44:19] put him in my life for a reason so I'm
[1:44:21] just hoping before long he won't he
[1:44:24] won't do that anymore but I I I I look
[1:44:27] at these people and I want them to
[1:44:28] change I don't want anybody to be like
[1:44:30] that but you know the center of the
[1:44:32] world the things out here we got the we
[1:44:35] got some of the most powerful people on
[1:44:37] the planet that don't even know who what
[1:44:39] a woman is that's right in this country
[1:44:41] so but they're doing what they do
[1:44:43] because that's who they are yeah amen
[1:44:46] they can't help be who they are they're
[1:44:48] just manifesting who they are just like
[1:44:51] we are manifesting
[1:44:53] remember I'm I guess I shut up uh
[1:44:57] remember in Genesis the serpent bruises
[1:45:00] the heel of the woman's seed Satan is
[1:45:03] always impersonating what God's doing
[1:45:05] yes the real is the bride and Christ
[1:45:08] living through her the the fake is out
[1:45:10] here in the world where they're
[1:45:13] manifesting the same way just in a
[1:45:15] perversion of it amen the bride is
[1:45:18] living it by the truth of God's word yes
[1:45:21] amen thank God for that because it's the
[1:45:24] Lord Jesus in us living through us that
[1:45:27] proves to this world that he is the same
[1:45:30] yesterday today and forever amen I got

[1:48:50] you can make it or not um I know it's
[1:48:53] Friday
[1:48:54] night uh Saturday night and Sunday but
[1:48:57] to make sure to to get you the the times
[1:49:00] of it right he had to change one of the
[1:49:02] times
[1:49:04] because uh the change let's see here uh
[1:49:08] February 161 17 that's Friday and
[1:49:11] Saturday at 700 p.m oh well it looks a
[1:49:14] same then I thought he changed one of
[1:49:15] them to six for a
[1:49:17] reason oh I know he told me he would
[1:49:20] have done six on
[1:49:22] Saturday uh but for a conflict he moved
[1:49:25] it to S so Friday night and Saturday
[1:49:27] night are 7 pm. Sunday morning 10:30 of
[1:49:30] course we'll have service here uh Sunday

[1:50:04] Roger so uh if you can attend I'm sure
[1:50:07] you'd be a blessing to them in your
[1:50:08] presence if not please pray for them
[1:50:11] amen so did sister matis did you have
[1:50:13] something real quick oh yeah I just
[1:50:15] wanted to say that um when we you know
[1:50:20] the Lord taught me something about the
[1:50:23] battle between yielding oursel with his
[1:50:26] spirit and what happens when we fall and
[1:50:31] what he showed me was that I was when I
[1:50:34] fall it's because the Temptation comes
[1:50:37] and it's like brother Brown said if you
[1:50:39] look at the Devil and and you try to
[1:50:42] rebuke it rebuke it well that's all you
[1:50:44] looking at so that's what you're going
[1:50:45] to get what you see is what you get and
[1:50:47] so what he's showed me was I look at who
[1:50:51] I am what I identify with identify with
[1:50:55] Christ so I identify with his feelings
[1:50:59] it starts his emotions for what he's
[1:51:01] leading me to do against that thing so
[1:51:04] then I hold that so then there that ends
[1:51:07] the battle right there because I'm not
[1:51:10] looking at something I'm not looking at
[1:51:12] a Temptation I'm looking at Christ amen
[1:51:15] just what brother no said yeah that's
[1:51:17] absolutely yeah you look at the promise
[1:51:20] don't matter if I have to lay in bed a
[1:51:21] couple days for it to heal or what I'm
[1:51:23] already healed Jesus you said I'm Healed
[1:51:26] I believe it I'm Healed period that ends
[1:51:28] it battle's over done no matter what you
[1:51:31] feel like no matter what it sounds like
[1:51:33] no matter what it looks like no matter
[1:51:34] what the doctors say battle's over amen
[1:51:37] that's it praise the Lord that's God's
[1:51:39] promise amen and like she said we look
[1:51:43] to that like brother no said we look to
[1:51:44] that promise amen not to the symptoms
[1:51:47] not in the mirror to the promise amen
[1:51:50] praise the Lord amen let's stand then to
[1:51:52] our feet if we could amen God has been
[1:51:55] good to us so thankful of his grace and
[1:51:57] mercy to us amen so again remember next
