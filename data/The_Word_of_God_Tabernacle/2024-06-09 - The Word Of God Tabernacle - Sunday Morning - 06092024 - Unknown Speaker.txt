of the days so I appreciate your prayers I went over to the job site Friday and uh it looked like they had done pretty good uh all the outside work except for the stuff Under The Canopy is done those few things could be done in the morning when it's cooler so uh it shouldn't be too rough a week but U we found I was joking with the crew but uh sent him a text of a rental for one of those big huge swamp coolers and actually one of the guys on the team who's worked in the warehouse says we have one of those nobody's using it so he went last week and picked it up and took it to the job site so we have a little bit of something uh when we work up north and it's really cold it's cold outside it's really cold I you know but uh up there they Clos the ends of the tunnels and they put heaters inside so if you get really cold you just go in and warm up but when it's hot like this there's unless you get in your car or something there's no place to go to cool off it's just hot it's just hot it's always hot so uh appreciate your prayers about that too so we drink a lot of water try to stay hydrated but appreciate your prayers about that too amen so anybody have unspoken request Lord knows all of our needs to amen let's stand to our feet if we could take the Lord ask for Lord Jesus we're so thankful to know that you have redeemed Us by your blood and to serve you with all that's in our heart Lord Jes I say this so often but it's so true there's so many that are just fighting to um line up with your word you know I just read in your word where Paul said you cannot eat drink the cup of devils and drink the cup of the Lord you cannot Feast the table of the Lord and feast at the table of the Devils lord it's time to make our stand for you thank you KN as we stand for you you will stand for us we know that with the hour of your coming is Right upon us your word says to redeem the time for the days are evil Amen to make good time of what we have to put you first Lord there's

committed fully surrendered fully dedicated Our Lives to to you for you have to have the preeminence you have to be first in our lives father and we know Lord that I I heard your Prophet say that

over the service anyone have a testimony on your heart you'd like to give sister been going to the doctors got L doctor friends I thought all we do is go to the doctor and go pick up medicine praise God hallelujah this is the new thing for dead P we almost 80 years old and it's a little different yeah I was in the doctor's office the other day about my back and they took the next grade and they came back again went back in the office and he said I surgery on my L5 break break when I was in my 30s 40s and he said hey that's rebuilt itself oh praise the Lord yes praise God praise God Amen and amen and and I want the Lord to know that I appreciate that so much praise God that's not I'm hurting my Lord that's not where I'm hurting amen you know but to think that your body can replace itself amen he said it revealed itself praise God and he said it and it just um went over my head and I just wanted to say no God did that yes I didn't get it out amen well it's kind of the same thing we can't do it no I couldn't tell that it was no it was the Lord amen right but praise God praise the Lord he can do surgery on Amen absolutely had it done many times our families had it done many times yes oh yes amen Just Praise Him for that praise the Lord I reminds me I keep forget to ask prayer for M Michael former Barber uh Thomas uh may have known two three years ago I brought a prayer request because he had a pretty bad bicycle accident on Mount l he's a cycler uh he Cycles a lot he's usually cycling the tour to Tucson but he had a really bad crash up on Mount Limon two or three years ago and I get prayer requests but it's very possible you remember but anyway um everything healed good uh his right shoulder I think it was his left what is his left shoulder I think it's his left shoulder was broken in the accident and they plated it and screwed it and all this stuff stuff and uh figured everything was going to be fine well now two or three years later they come to find he keep kept having pain cuz he works like this Barber that is so he kept having pain so he went back and they finally did some more x-rays find out that bone is not healing itself uh God's not healing it's not healing it's not going it's not growing back together uh the only thing holding it together still is the plate and screws or whatever they put in there so he's had to retire so he retired May 31st so we have to find a new Barber but anyway um uh I I want to pray that the Lord would just heal him uh and touch him partially selfish because he because I talk to him and if it gets better he's going to come back so uh but I really want the Lord to just touch him because uh when he first started talking about it to me and John was about the same time that uh the Lord had touched my knees I had Joel came up and the brothers and touch laid hands on my knees which now they're just they're really good uh not 100% but probably 90 uh now but and I haven't even been to PT in three or four weeks uh for insurance reasons anyway uh and so I was giving him that testimony about what the Lord did with my knees and at the same time John gave a testimony about his I think it was his shoulder uh where he went through a prayer line here a little while back and he wasn't going to but he felt in compelled to go through and went through the prayer line had his shoulder prayed for and when he sat down he had the exact same feeling I had on my knees after Joel prayed for me but he head on my knees remember I told you all that there was that really warm sensation in my knees at that time John had the same thing in his shoulder his shoulders been fine ever since and we gave Thomas these testimonies Thomas Catholic uh but we gave him these testimonies and I just I I really love to see that the the Lord move on his shoulder and heal it perfectly completely and and go back to work and be able to be with him and give testimony again uh to what the Lord has done for him so uh when you pray remember Thomas if you would uh again I keep forgetting to bring his name up when we have our prayer request here but please remember I would I would certainly appreciate that anyone else I have several I'm share them A real quick um we know the scripture says redeem the time for the days are evil um as much as you can we need to make an effort above all to show the Lord we want to obey his word we need to be in church we can feel his presence amen the last communion service we had had I felt the presence of the Lord uh stronger than the most service amen yes and so I stopped on the way down Oracle to get some gas and there was a young lady um seemed like she was homeless she was asking different ones um you know for some change and um she went around and and all of a sudden she appeared in front of me and she says uh do you have some spare change she looked at me she says I'm going to church later on today you know I I'll be in church myself I didn't say a word yeah and and then she told me um you know I love the Lord and and I told her serve the Lord with all your heart first accept him and truly make him a full part of your life oh I have done it thank you praise the Lord I'm going to church you see our our testimonies cancel speak for itself amen abolutely we have to get to that place of the book of Acts be WR yourself amongst us as the end time Believers another testimony real quick um I had bought some special stuff in my hair when I got my last haircut and that bottle was pretty expensive I couldn't find it I looked and looked Leah looked and so I just committed to the Lord and so lord it's in your hands so I went to get my truck through ad missions you know I got out the guy you know they check I got back home and long behold in the back of the truck there was the conditioner oh I could you know you know the angel wow yeah because it I was in and out of that truck many days till you know you know going there and another testimony and I I'll quit um you know it was time a few months ago to do our taxes and uh prior uh last year we uh well 202 we paid a lot on our taxes something with different things we did and we ended up paying several thousand so I told Leah be prepared you know we're going to have to uh Buy uh several thousand again and when the guy was done with our taxes I told him you know just let me know don't hesitate call me I got to get mailed in I know I'm going to have to pay we got a little bit back from federal and a little bit back from Arona State all right and that's given the glory to the Lord praise the Lord wonderful wonderful amen that's great I look at and I they take so much money out of my my check it's something real but I got to pay for those illegals somehow I guess anyway that's a whole another thing let's stand to our feet if we oh sorry go ahead brother Pat praise the Lord we're here today amen I'm very happy about that not an easy thing but but the Lord's with us all the time I've lost the Lord's taken a couple of my friends close friends home so left with not many people left to talk to but the Lord sent me a new friend and a Jewish fell and he wants to be my friend and he says this is uh the Lord doing some work here I I see the Lord working with you being what he sent to me to be a friend amen so whether the Lord sent him to me or whether the Lord sent me to him I don't know but it's uh put you together it it's amazing because we talk more about God than anybody ever so it's great amen it's amazing when you become a Christian where you see you see God in everything nothing happens to your life that you don't see God yesen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet then we'll just go to the scripture now amen not not that just he's everywhere I was taught as a kid I remember when Emma's age Joel's age I was taught that God was everywhere uh you know the story brother Bram tells about uh the man going to the boy or boy fishing or something you know or the boy going to the man excuse me and uh you know I want to find God I'm trying to find God and and the the dad says go ask the preacher and the preacher says whatever and he goes and he's discouraged and he goes out and he sees this man fishing he said the man says what's what's the matter young man why are you so sad he said well I went to my dad and my preacher my pastor I've went trying to find God I can't find him anywhere and he says do you know where he is he said son that's what I've been looking at all day I've been enjoying him and looking at him all day long it's all I've been doing amen something so very simple isn't it praise the Lord but then when you become a Christian and get to the place you you don't just see him in everything you just know that he's in every single facet of your life nothing happens but what God's not in control of it amen something as simple as bringing two people together amen amen praise the Lord fir uh 2 Corinthians chapter 10 got a couple more the Lord willing couple more parts to this uh the Gateway part five we'll start second Corinthians part 10 uh chapter 10 again second Corinthians 10 here pardon me if my nose runs a little bit I quit taking allergy medicine I got tired of taking it so I'm just not taking it now so it may man and the Lord's blessed I've been feeling good so but every once in a while my throat good scratchier like you can probably tell or my uh nose runs a little bit but uh by his grace I'm healed amen amen let's just bow our heads another word prayer before read the word Lord Jesus again father come before your throne Lord you asked us to do that you asked us to do it boldly and we do it God believing that you are mindful of us and that Lord your hand is upon us to strengthen and bless us and Lord the testimonies we've heard and the prayer requests God has just been so good to been in the house of the Lord to this point but we know God that you have something even that much more important that you want to reveal to us and show to us through your word encourage Us by it today Lord and help us to know God that Lord you are always with us that you never leave us or forsake us and that God we want to continue to press this battle by faith trusting you Lord keeping ourselves in a place Lord that we have our faculties Lord we yield our members to you Lord yes God may your Holy Spirit continue to strengthen and bless us along the way continue to keep us in the center of your perfect will lead us and guide us Lord into your uh in all the truths of your word God we know that your word is here it is true it is forever settled in heaven God just continue to reveal it to us Lord that we ourselves become more like you Lord more in your image God that you would uh use us for the furance of your kingdom yes forgive all of our sin and iniquity bless your bride worldwide internationally wherever they are and whoever they may be Lord our precious brothers and sisters around the world that make up this mystical body of Jesus Christ we just lift them before you Lord in each one of us Lord those that are here now God those who may be watching we just committ ourselves to you the remaining part of this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ we pray amen 2 Corinthians chap 10 verse 5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ you can be seated if your life I want to also bring out as we looked at this and we've read this of course as we do do a series we kind a scripture that's the theme of this uh uh of the of the series uh to try to begin with to continue to refresh our memories of what the scripture says about that particular thing that we're looking at but uh I want us to notice here that uh in in the fifth verse particularly uh that we just read it says casting down imagination every High thing exalts itself but look what it says now it doesn't say that every High thing exalted itself against God it said every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God Amen now not that the two aren't uh uh synonymous obviously God and the knowledge of God is synonymous because to know God is to have God to uh uh to have faith in God believe God trust God God be in our lives but the knowledge of God is something very specific to the understanding of of the Mind itself which is what we're our whole subject has been about uh these five Services about the knowledge of God or that knowledge that comes into uh that comes into our mind first that we that we take in as much as we talk about and we uh major on the new birth which is a soul birth which has nothing to do with the mind uh we have to understand that of course receiving in the word of God as we read as we listen uh all that comes in through our s and through our intelligence and through our uh U hearing and and all the faculties of our body comes into our minds it comes into our minds to receive that's why uh uh that all this that exalts itself against the knowledge of God or the truth of God to understand that that would be as brother random said as we read a couple of times that that place that Satan chose uh that he would want to have control over have uh access to the mind the knowledge of God he wanted to have access to the mind to do like he did in the Garden of Eden and that was to draw doubt by bringing in a knowledge that was other than God which is exalted against the knowledge of God that's what Satan did in the G Garden of Eden when he brought that lie to Eve to the woman he brought something and then of course in transversally gave over to Adam it was a knowledge amen what he was giving her was knowledge but what he was doing is he was exalting it above or against the knowledge that Eve already had that was of God the knowledge of God was don't partake of this or you will that day you'll die amen amen and the knowledge of Satan came and exalted itself against that Amen to bring doubt into her mind and when and and when it left the knowledge of God brought in doubt when doubt came in then Faith becomes weak right uh when faith is weakened then you don't then you don't believe God uh like we should because the only way to know God the only way to believe God we have to have faith amen uh it is impossible to please God without faith so you have to have faith so when the doubt comes in when the fear comes in it kills the faith and when the faith is gone then you have nothing but a knowledge and when you have nothing but a knowledge knowled then we're in bad trouble because if it comes to my mind uh knowledge is what corrupts amen knowledge knowledge is why many people leave God because of understanding which I may be getting a little ahead of myself we're to read the scripture in just a minute but um many people leave God because of understanding amen because of their minds right how many times have you heard people say I don't understand why God great why would God allow this why would God do this why would God and see people get in their minds and they try to figure God out with what not their Spirit not their soul their mind they try to figure him out and then and then when you can't figure God out which you cannot there's no way to figure God out with your mind when they can't figure God out they say well I I just can't believe a god like that how can you serve a God Like That that how can you worship a god like that why would you uh give your life over to a god that would allow something like that to happen see they missed the whole obvious the whole context of being a Christian and what the scripture and what God's about and what humanity is about and our free moral agency amen U but the knowledge that's that's my whole point the understanding that people try to figure God out with their minds they don't try to figure God out with the scripture and try to figure them out with their minds and they don't understand why God would do something yeah why God would allow something and when they do that then people leave God because they don't grasp Romans 8:28 that God will make everything everything what we consider good what we consider bad what we consider otherwise he makes all work together for our good if we love him and that love is unconditional if you love God unconditionally you have unconditional faith and your faith brings you to the place of believing God regardless of what the circumstances look like and it came to my thought uh this week in the past couple of days I've been reading a story a little bit uh it's not really a story but just u a a media report of uh a family Pastor his wife his children they're on a vacation and something that you just probably has never happened happen in humanity and will probably never ever happen again happened to their little six-year-old girl and killed her they were playing bad mitt on the last day of their vacation and I guess one of their sons it sounds like was going to hit the bad Mitten racket broke in half and the metal part com and impaled itself and went through the girl skull and killed her as she died a few days later now how do you understand that right that's probably never happened I mean I would go out of limb and guarantee you that has never happened yeah and I could probably go out of limb and guarantee you that will never happen again but it happened to this family and the thing of it was that this little girl was so uh she kind of reminds me actually even of of Joel and Emma uh she had been asking how do you how do you get to be with God uh how do you she started asking the things uh of course the man's a pastor and you know they they teach your children about Christ and go to church and all and so they they they engulf envelop their their family their children with godliness and with Christianity and with Christ and and but she was starting to ask about being with God and going to be with God and things like that and just not long before this accident happened but when something like that happen most people would just you know why would God how can I serve a god like that you know that that kind of they start reasoning in their mind why would God allow this to happen see we don't understand God's ways right we can't explain God's ways we're never going to figure God's ways out we just believe him amen and the mind is the worst weapon the worst thing that we have that to to twist that into a way to try to bring doubt and when doubt comes in just like at that family if that family started to doubt I don't care if the man's a pastor if they're devout Christians I'm the message I don't born again I don't care what if they started getting in their minds the to doubt God about this event that took place and it just seems unfathomable then then when doubt comes in then the faith starts to reing just like fear when fear comes in the the faith starts to erode and then it just goes away and then what happens what do you have when you've lost faith in what you have amen nothing but your intellect yeah nothing but your knowledge nothing but your understanding and that will absolutely and always has and will fail you amen praise the Lord let's go over to Ephesians I kind of wanted to pick up a little if you will before we left off last week I believe if I remember right the last scripture we read Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 that understanding see that understanding figuring reasoning in the mind that's why we're to cast all that down that's why we're to bring all those thoughts captive to The Obedience of the word yes amen I don't understand it uh I told I told the Lord this many times and I told him again this morning probably may never in this life know why I didn't why we didn't get to spend more time with our son why the Lord took him why I never I we'll probably never know but the the why is not important that's right it's just trusting believing having faith God making everything work together why why God chose to take that little six-year-old girl and when I saw six obviously my mind thought about him a first thing but why little six-year-old girl in that situation and and then the Lord decides to take her with the most freak accident I've probably ever heard of and i' we've all heard some pretty weird circumstances that have happened that have injured or killed people but I never heard anything to that degree before it just it just it just kind of overcame me um and made me start thinking about that that's why a lot of people leave God Amen because then they start trying to understand and try to figure it out and try to and they use their minds to do that and it takes them further and further away from God Amen Ephesians chapter 2 again I believe this is the last scripture we read uh last week and you ha he Quicken who are dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience amen which is the spirit that comes against your mind that we just read in 2 Corinthians among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others amen consecrate me now amen all my nature refined Amen to Jesus is the only thing I see till Jesus is the only thing there Jesus is the only only influence in my life Jesus is the one that has the complete total control the life of God in Me amen that lives through me praise the Lord the the nature amen remember the Soul's the nature of the spirit brother brand teaches us Soul's the nature of the spirit so if the soul is God then that nature is going to permeate itself into your spirit and in and into your flesh praise the Lord but at this time we were born in s shap the iniquity come in the world speaking lies amen our minds our nature was to obey sin to live in sin amen our minds our thoughts didn't even think anything about it as you become Christian become born again it becomes a totally different situation where you start the things in life then start to take over you to where you recognize it's it's not my faults that I'm living by it's not my thoughts that that bring my actions to to to life it's the spirit that's in me that controls my spirit that controls my body that controls my flesh that controls my mind amen but remember you have control see that's one of the one of the greatest deceptions in this world today or at least our country I know one of the greatest deceptions that we we have that brings no responsibility to people who do wrong there seems to be no repercussions no responsibility people always want to blame it on something else oh this person has this or this person has that I don't care what they have I'm sorry but they did this and it's wrong yeah and they have to pay the price for it I remember years and years ago when I was probably in my 20s the first time time I ever heard about a murder defense a person that had murdered somebody and their defense was Insanity my first thought was well of course they're insane they just killed somebody right but that doesn't that shouldn't let them off the hug right that shouldn't give them a that's not a get out of jail free card but that's what it's become and it seems like and that's been 30 40 years ago since then it's gotten worse and worse yeah amen they excuse this and excuse that and well they have a right to do this well they have it's okay that they steal this much or it's okay that they do this and nobody nobody takes responsibility yeah no responsibility there's been court cases in this country that's come up and and people say well it's blah blah blob this this this this and this I don't care about all that did they do this this is against the law they did this and because they broke the law they should pay the penalty period yeah there is no oh well were they raised in a bad home or were were they lived in a single parent home or were was it this or they sick with this or they got addicted on drugs or something I don't care I'm sorry I wish it weren't I hope they get better but that's not the point right the point is it's against the law you did it you pay the price but see there's no personal responsibility anymore there's no there's no uh uh repercussions anymore but see people are free moral agents and have the ability to choose what they want to do they make their own choices and they operate their lives based on their choices most people's choices from their mind their intellect their knowledge and again that will absolutely destroy you every time right but a Christian doesn't do that a born again Christian receives what their free moral agency is and we are still free moral Agents from the from the new nature uh that that we have the spirit of God that now comes and controls the spirit that controls the body that we allow to control our minds we have a choice people act like nowaday she don't have a choice oh well they're like that they were born that way no they weren't right that that that that boy was was that girl was born a boy but she was always supposed to be a girl no she wasn't no he wasn't right God doesn't make any mistakes friend I'm sorry amen that's just the way I feel about it God God doesn't make mistakes amen and by putting it on God to say they we're born that way now I know through hybrid foods and all kinds of stuff that there's all kind of birth defs and things I understand all that and things that mess up kids' minds and stuff but it but but a person is not that's born a boy is a boy not a girl a a person that's BN born a girl is a girl not a boy and you don't say well they were supposed to be this way by whose authority right by whose authority was this supposed to be a girl who says there supposed to be a girl just because of some Spirit has gotten on them to pervert them to make them feel like no accountability yeah amen that's the whole thing no accountability but see and again from the mind their thoughts it's it's what perverts their minds again look here the spirit that worketh in the children of Disobedience disobedient to what the word right they're not disobedient maybe to the government or to their parents or whatever but they're disobedient to the word amen and now that there's no accountability now that there's no repercussion we're we this is my opinion we're devolving into a third world country that anyway but there's no there's no accountability is is complete Disobedience to God's word the lust of the flesh the pride of life the fulfilling of the desires of the flesh the desires of the Mind where do the desires of the Mind come from from what you can see what you can feel what you can hear these things every one of these things has a spirit and those Spirits attached to that person's spirit and perverts that person's Spirit right right make them think they's something they're not right make them think they're some perversion that's outside of God's word amen yeah and when it's outside of God's word then it's wrong I'm sorry that's just that's that's the way I believe it if it's outside of God's word it's wrong the government science medicine is not the ultimate Authority God's word is amen and if it goes outside that then there is no Authority there Common Sense friend has just got to the place that's not common anymore we used to call it common sense I don't know if we can call it sense anymore or sensible what used to be sensible just doesn't seem to be sensible anymore it used to be the things that you see now and and and how does this come about through through Disobedience to God's word amen through the lustful through the through the fulfilling of desires of the of the Flesh and of the Mind amen these As We Know divined by the scripture are the children of Wrath amen I just thank God that at one time I was dead in my sin as most of the world is now I'm dead to sin amen amen sin has no hold on me anymore yes sin has no authority over me on anymore sin has nothing to hold me anymore amen when God loosed me and set me free and filled me with his Spirit it Loose Sin from you it Loose Sin from us and has no no grip No Authority anymore there was a time where Satan could lay claim and say I'm taken them with me because now it's gone he cannot do that anymore because it's loosed its grip he cannot go before God who is the author of life and say I'm going to take them because God says no that has no authority over this person amen amen by the blood of Christ it's been released they have no nothing else to do with sin sin has no more grip over you if sin has no more grip over you then Satan has no more grip over you amen praise the Lord let's go over another couple chapters chapter 4 second uh seal in Ephesians amen Ephesians chapter 4 you know we criticize often probably I know I do I probably more than I should but you criticize people for the things they do the way they look the way they dress the way they act the things they do I I probably more critical than I should because the understanding truly is that they're just acting out living out who they are amen I mean I I could go to the cactus right here across the street and yell at and scream at all I want that it should be a rose bush but that Cactus is never going to be a rose bush right amen and I'm I'm not saying some of these people uh don't have the opportunity or ability to be a child of God I'm not saying that right but I'm just saying they're acting it's growing and acting and living a cactus life because that's what it is amen so I understand that but we we must understand that even though we can be critical of people's actions you started the first it had to first start in their mind right amen it had to come to the Gateway first before it ever became an action it became a thought amen the first thing it could be is a thought then it can become an action amen and people and then that's where uh these things come in life people act them out before we go to uh Ephesians 4 let me read this look in going beyond the camp 1964 brother Ram says and when a man can smoke cigarettes and doctors proving to him that thousands die every year from the cause and can still puff away at cigarettes it seems like there's something wrong with that man's mind you would think that's true what are they doing they're fulfilling the lust of their mind of their flesh and it becomes an addiction I understand that just like drugs and Things become an addiction even uh over-the-counter drugs even prescription drugs can become an addiction I understand that some have more addicted properties than others alcohol and cigarettes and things they become addicted I understand that but that does not relieve a person of their personal responsibility right right amen there's been people say Well they're an addict I don't care I'm sorry hope you get better but I don't care because the bottom line is you have a choice there's been thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of peoples who we addicts and are not anymore you have a choice there's thousands of people hundreds millions of people that used to be drunks they're not anymore they're not alcoholics why because they made a choice amen it was their decision to not be this way anymore yeah and his brother V was saying this person smoking away puffing his cigarettes when doctors can prove that it's killing thousands of people now hundreds of thousands probably every year now of course I don't know I I see less people smoking anymore than used to but I do work on a a construction site every other week so I probably see my more than my fair share of smokers but anyway it just makes you realize or wonder what is what is Gras a hold of that person's mind to think that well I'm going to be the person that doesn't die from this I'm going to be the person that doesn't end up with cellophane skin I'm going to be the person that doesn't have blood clots I'm going to be the person that doesn't lose limbs and have stuff uh uh surgery to have my tongue removed or my jaw removed or I'm going to be the person that's going to be perfectly fine because of smoking cigarettes my whole life doesn't work that way amen amen doesn't work that way and brother BR says there must be something wrong with that man's mind and you would have to think that there has to be some mental capacity in that person to to say something's wrong there amen but he goes on and says this now and when a man has a mental shock uh doesn't get himself together what he's doing he'll search every doctor's office there is in the country to find out what's going wrong with him but then he'll stand at the door of a bar or in the car and drink until he is totally insane spend his money shove himself into that and and if he happen to get into it without the intoxication of liquor then he'll spend every penny he finds in the doctor's office trying to figure out what is wrong with him brother says it doesn't make any sense and it doesn't to a regular normal thinking mind it doesn't make any sense yeah it it's like people it's like someone putting their hand on a table and taking a ballpen hammer and smashing their first digit and say and going to the doctor and saying what happened to my finger Doc it's broken pieces what happened and trying to figure out a cause when he's the one that laid the hammer to it and try to go figure out medically what's wrong sister f was some about getting old I've never Ed the word diet and and myself in the same sentence ever in my life and you could probably look at me tell why but I'm on a as you'd say diet now amen because I'm trying to be more careful about certain things that I intake ingest it's not something that I'm just cold jkey but I just more careful amen of things and and the results are the results speak for themselves amen I'm not bragging my wife says don't brag not bragging but I've lost 10 10 pound since I started doing this well praise the Lord I'm like I'm just shocked not bragging I'm just shocked I I I just I wouldn't have believed that would be possible in like two weeks how I'm like if time keeps going I'm going to disappear at this rate two pounds already and and my feet feel better so praise the Lorden uh now if if I keep doing what I was doing and my feet kept getting worse and I'd go back to the doctor and say Doc I just don't understand what's wrong with my feet he said well did you do what I told you I said well a little bit did you do what I told you did you read the prescription did you follow the prescription amen well not really well that's what's wrong with you if you want it to be better you got to you and we're all free more agents we all have the ability in our minds where is our free more agcy we have free more agcy and mind we decide remember we started with this the very first service we decide and even in a split second in the mind we can either accept it or reject it yeah amen and I am very happy and proud to say national donut dut day was Friday and I did not have a donut yeah felt good about myself praise the Lord I didn't ask Sonia to stop getting one or anything I was able to ref but it's not a big deal to me so when I was a kid like if I was Joel and Emma's age no that'd be a different story but nowadays it's it's not that big a deal anymore uh I I just you I don't when I was when I was Troll's age I my dad would take me to the store and I thought man if I could just if I just had a cart I'd take the candy a and just rake it off and I would eat it all before midnight when I went trick-or-treating I took a I took a a pillowcase sack I didn't take a little Jack Lantern thing or a little I took a pillowcase I was expecting to be filled up uh because that's just but now it's just not it's not that big a deal anymore but see what is it done I could still do that but in in in our minds uh is the acceptance or rejecting I are we going to accept it or are we going to reject it amen a lot of people accept it becomes part of their life smoke away drink away you get a result go to the doctor why doctor well are you doing this you got to choose amen got to choose then that's when brother brand comes up and says it doesn't make any sense why am I like this pretty obvious but the problem is a lot of people don't want to know the truth yeah a lot of times you tell people the truth and they don't they don't want to hear that they don't want to know they don't want to hear the truth amen because the truth is sometimes hard sometimes greats against the Flesh and it's difficult on the flesh it takes away something that you want to do that you desire to do you enjoy to do or eat or whatever it takes those things away and people don't want to know the truth yeah amen just that's just nature now had you turn to Ephesians 4 let's go through this real here not real quick but let's look at this Ephesians 4:17 start with verse 17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that he henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds so see it's a walk notice flesh walk in their minds the vanity of their minds the vanity is devoid of learning devoid of knowing uh devoid of godliness even uh if you go look at that definition uh vanity of their mind it doesn't necessarily mean that they're vain to per se uh but it just means devoid of that understanding or devoid of that principle of God they walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding remember that understanding is is in the mind the understanding having their understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them the ignorance what is ignorance ignorance isn't stupid ignorance isn't Dumb ignorance is not knowing amen ignorance is someone who doesn't know so the life of alienated from the life of of God through ignorance but look at their ignorance now why are they ignorant there's a reason why they're it's not just not knowing there's a reason why they don't know listen that is in them because of the blindness of their hearts or blindness is hardened their hearts have been hardened they don't want to hear about God they don't want to know about God is anybody ever met anybody like that you come and you try to present God to them and they just shut you down you know heartbeat because they don't want to know they don't want to hear it their their hearts are blackened their hearts are numb their hearts are seared remember uh I forget what scripture it is when it talks about their conscience being seared with a hot iron that means it's numb it's devoid of feeling it's it's uh it's black there's a numbness there because they don't want to know they they had the chance to know they had the opportunity to know they had the choice here we go back with the choice again they had the choice to know but they rejected amen their heart has been blinded blinded cut off hardened hardened against God now sometimes people get hardened against God because they've had a bad experience they blame God for something or they blame God for an an EV vent in their life or something and they shut God off they blame God and they think that's God's fault amen it's like going 80 miles an hour down the interstate and turning into a bridge embunkment and saying God why did you have me crash well I didn't you had the car you had the control of the pedal how fast you were going in the steering wheel you crashed not me I didn't crash you but people blame stuff like that on God I know that's a that's probably a ridiculous analogy but uh but that's similar to what a lot of people think why did God do this God didn't do it you did it they did it their choices did it amen but people will become hardened because of things like that their heart will become blackened hardened now they're ignorance yes but they're willingly ignorant remember the scripture that says they're willingly ignorant they don't want to know amen uh but it's but but it it is a walk it is an action amen the action that we the action that we perform every day is a result of what goes through our minds amen the action that anybody performs every day is a result of what goes through their minds amen 19th verse who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness they want to do it that's just it they enjoy the lust they enjoy the Fulfillment of the lust so it doesn't mean anything the other doesn't mean anything to them because they're fil they're fulfilling the desires of their of their mind of the Flesh of their desires lasciviousness uncleanness greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus now where are you taught again over and over it it reiterates to us the point that the scripture I believe and Paul to the Ephesians is trying to get AC cross in your mind we are taught in our minds even we as Born Again Christians when we read the scripture when we heard it priests when we listen to it or when we feed on it it comes into our minds we are taught it but there's a thing in a bornan believer that takes them Beyond just knowing it in their mind and that is your soul is Born Again by the spirit of God and he brings a revelation of that word where it becomes real then it's not just a thought right it's something that becomes a part of you it is now who you are not just what you think or even what you do it's who you are now of course you're going to do what you are but it's it's a part of you now revelation God bringing himself and showing if someone can convince you of something and it's just a part of what you think a next person can come through with a better argument about the situation and talk you right out of what you just thought you were going to believe forever right amen if they come through with a better argument they can change what's in your mind because remember even in the Garden of Eden remember notice this is the one of the greatest we said this in the beginning greatest tools that say has is to is is to bring this in life that's what happened in the Garden of Eden she had the knowledge of God through what her husband had told her amen God told Adam the day you eat thereof the day you die he tells his wife now I know that's not in the scripture but there's no place that we find where God told her that so where would she have learned it from her husband her head which is where she should have learned it because she's a part of she is woe man correct so she had that knowledge well she believed it I believe she believed it absolutely so much so that when she came into the discussion with the serpent she repeated it to the serpent because that's what she believed but she only believed it here she only believed it as an intellectual conception so when he came through and his AR argument was oh well yeah that's true that is right but God does know but also in addition to no words no additions it was and is exactly the way God said it amen always period but he comes and says but in addition God does know that when you do this you're going to become as God's knowing good and evil and so on so for and he was right absolutely truth that's exactly what happened but it was against God's word but it was the same tactics the devil used then he uses the same tactics now he's trying he tries to do the exact same thing to us now to G to bring a bigger AR greater argument that's why that when you become born again it it that something that is of God must become a revelation to you must become a part of you that way I don't care who comes through with what kind of argument against or about you know what the truth is yeah you know when someone comes and tries to tell you that brother R was a false prophet you know to shut that down right quick I had a brother say well I can I can send you so and so V I said I'm not interested I don't want to hear it I don't want to see it I don't care it's not going to persuade me it's not going to sway me so if it's not going to persuade me that brother Bam's a false prophet then why waste my time listening to it right amen amen I don't care I don't want to know I I'm I'm sorry someone else has been fooled by it probably many people had been swayed by that but I know in what I believe there is no argument you can come or or whatever garbage is spew to try to bring a defense against I don't care I know what I believe I don't need to hear that amen because it's become a part of me amen and there's no argument Satan can try to bring through anybody that's going to convince me any differently praise the Lord been taught look again been taught by him as the truth in Jesus 22nd verse that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man putting off the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust now we talk about putting off an old man of our nature but what about this old man that I am I learned a lot of things when I was a sinner amen I learned a lot of wrong things when I was a sinner I learned a lot of things that were against God when I was a sinner that old man's got to go amen amen I can't take all the other things that I've learned out of a denomination and try to merge them in with the message it doesn't work amen amen praise the Lord that old man's got to die which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust be renewed and be renewed in the spirit of your mind which is the same word it talks about in um uh let this mind be in you which is in Christ Jesus also um u in Romans where it talks about the I'm trying to remember the exact scripture how it's how it's quoted or how it's read about re about not being conformed to the world but being transformed the transformation is the renewing amen it's the same uh it's the same root word here when it talks about being renewed in the spirit of REM mind it's talking about being transformed not conform not changing not making yourself a different person but letting God come and transform you amen so that you become a new creature for 24th verse and that you put on the new man which is after God in created is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath now Paul's just giving good advice he's just giving good sound human advice to the Ephesian Church he's doing the same as we read it here today amen it's just good Godly Sound Advice neither give place to the devil amen don't allow the devil any room in any way not a wedge not a door opening of any kind don't let the don't give the devil any kind of place at all amen it's a thought that shouldn't be spoken and cast it down bring it captive don't speak it the devil can use that that's a wedge Amen Let give no PL never don't give a place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer praise the Lord and ain't that what we want to be beacons of Truth beacons of light beacons of Mercy Grace amen let's it out of merciful god God calls on us to be a merciful people Amen to be a loving caring forgiving merciful people amen grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you forgiven us amen amen he has forgiven us he has been merciful to us us so what do we do in kind we are merciful to others yes we give that same Grace to others that need it and this world needs it more than ever amen of course there will be no peace until he comes yes but let me read this quote in in the in the message Fellowship 1962 he talks about the Waters of separation separating us the Waters of Separation letting us recognize that we are sinners that we're trespassers that's the reason I could Hammer the thing sin of course he's talking about that's the reason any Minister ought to stand against anything that God said is wrong to do if he's Spirit-filled he will for it comes from Heaven against the wrong and we mustn't do that that that's the Waters of Separation still that wasn't enough look now that wasn't enough he understood now brother brand was talking about physical uh understanding the mind he understood that was his knowledge his mind the womb of his mind the Battlegrounds where the battle is fought in the mind then he cast it aside he accept that is God's provided way Amen in his mind in his knowledge notice now he said that's where he accepted is he ready for Fellowship now brother R says no no that was Lucifer's message just get it up here and you're okay just believe you're just believe you're okay believe you're born again just believe that you have accepted just amen and people even confess it amen amen I I I had one of my best friends um he he was a good man he followed um a Ministry that was uh I'd say off the word I heard the Minister preach very popular very well known on the tell evangelists and stuff like that uh and I had a little contention with him one time we discussed the scripture many times most of the time we uh we were very U cordial about it but one time we had little contention about scripture and he was trying to tell me he went to talk to this woman that was a sales consultant at the at our company and uh how to become Born Again of course he believed that speaking in evidence speaking in tongues was initial evidence of the Holy Ghost so he just said read the scripture confess with your mouth believe confess with your mouth and speak in tongues and that's it you're say you're you're born again that that's that's it so he got her to confess with her mouth said yeah I believe God and then he got her to jabber which he told me how they do it I don't know how they blah blah blah blah blah whatever they do and and she started jabbering he says she he says stop you've got it and and I I How Could You deceive her like that right yeah that I I know and see he took not the jabbering part with the tongues but he took the a part of the scripture that that you confess with your mouth that is scripture I understand that amen but this is the point brother brandom is trying to get to here that's good now look he said he said that was Luther's message uh and and that and that means that he's headed in the right direction now amen but that's not all there is it's not all just thinking well it's it's okay I believe I I've accepted I confessed I I want Jesus as my savior well that's fine that's a nice in that's a nice intellectual uh uh Christianity but what about a born again experience amen there's more than just saying why I believe that that he is uh that he's God I believe I accept him as my personal savior that was all the that's what we were taught in the Baptist Church you know just you accept Jesus as your personal savior then you know when you get baptized and that's you you you've made it and we know that's not true there's more to the scripture there's more to the story The just an intellectually he said now if you've received it you've got it you believe it you spoke it uh you're on the way that's good but so many people stop there they they they end their experience with that and then all it becomes as an intellectual experience and not a born again experience when we don't have the Born Again experience you don't have God Amen you've got an intellectual conception of it you can go to any church in the world you go to any Seminary or something you can learn an intellectual conception but it takes a new birth that kills the old man that makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus it takes a new birth it takes the Holy Spirit coming and taking control over your life amen making you a new person amen I got one more scripture and I'm going to close here here in Romans uh Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter 1 read one verse verse 28 I'll close here Romans 1: 128 and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge even as they listen L how this is worded they even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over now this kind of goes with the last scripture that was talking about the the the ignorance the willfully ignorance the will the ignorance based on the blinded heart the hardened heart did not like to retain God in their knowledge and I don't want to hear about God don't talk to me about God I don't want to know anything about him amen okay then that's what you'll have did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind now that is why someone would think that they were a girl when they were born a boy right amen and so many other things along those lines we go into but right there it is they did not like to retain God in a knowledge this country rejected God Amen we know that God gave them over to reprobate mind and now it's a common thing now it's common it's thought to be normal if you will it's okay accepted when it's filthiness in by the scriptures definition it's it's filthiness in God's mind if it's filthiness in God's mind it's filthiness in mine sorry I love the person I want to see him saved and go to heaven but their actions and what they're doing is filthiness of God's mind and but the point is they don't want to know God right they don't want to hear about God if someone I I I'll say this With all sincerity from my heart if someone were to try to come and run for president that took a Godly attitude a scriptural Christian attitude and espouse those values in their uh speeches and all the ungodly things of the country and and espouse the true Christian Godly value you think that person probably won't even get but aund votes that person wouldn't be elected amen absolutely not why they don't want to know they don't like to retain the things of God in their knowledge I'll just I'll believe God with my mind of who I think he is God gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient amen when they've been given over to a reprobate mind then anything's okay yes doesn't matter anymore there are no standards there are no morals there are there is there literally is no right and wrong they do whatever they want yeah amen where is it they don't want to receive it they reject it reject God is to receive well you know what's not God the devil you receive everything that's evil wretched amen amen and that's the sad part about it all over but God has a people amen God has a people that's been called out that believe and stand upon his word amen praise God and they guard themselves because of their own human choice just exactly the way 2 Corinthians chapter 10 explains it right amen hallelujah she brings every thought captivity to The Obedience of Jesus Christ the Lord amen let's stand if we could she doesn't leave God because one little thing goes wrong she doesn't leave God because things don't work out the way she thought they were going to she doesn't leave God because it comes against what they thought or what they felt or how they believed it was going to be she trusts God yes she has faith in God and her faith in God outweighs everything else yes amen whether it's good to her him the person bad doesn't matter amen she holds it true because she knows that God has a way of making it work amen praise the Lord consecrate me now to thy service praise the Lord that should be all of our cries amen praise the Lord Jesus amen let's try this uh uh course that we've say many times amen Lord prepare me be a sanctuary God has made the way for us all Saints to live that life and he's made the way so that we are able to live it amen his life Us Praise the Lord let's sing it to him now amen sing it in worship with the desire of your heart Let It Be

your mind mind is no longer what you obey or listen to or follow amen it's the mind of Christ lives through the spirit of Christ that is who you are amen help us continue to pray for those that aren't and even don't want to be because you never know what difference the prayer that we send up before the Lord makes Before the Throne of God Amen God is mindful he knows him amen his ear is turned to
