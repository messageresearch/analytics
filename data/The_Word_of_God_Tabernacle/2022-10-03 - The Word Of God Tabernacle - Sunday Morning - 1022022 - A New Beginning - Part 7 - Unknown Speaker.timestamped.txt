[26:19] forevermore yes praise the Lord Jesus
[26:23] have a prayer of a couple prayer
[26:25] requests here
[26:26] um
[26:27] that I want us to remember was there any
[26:29] over there
[26:31] uh
[26:34] we want to remember uh
[26:36] want to remember I don't know if anybody
[26:38] wrote it down but we certainly want to
[26:40] remember those that were affected by the
[26:41] hurricane this week
[26:43] we actually had a working crew of one of
[26:47] our Newville Crews actually in Florida
[26:49] and the eye of the storm went right over
[26:52] them they're doing fine though they're
[26:54] okay they were more Inland they were
[26:56] they were kind of between Tampa and
[26:57] Orlando but the eye went right over and
[26:59] I'm sure those guys probably never
[27:01] experienced anything like that but for
[27:03] me and my family we've been through two
[27:05] or three of them but
[27:06] um I'm sure they never have but they're
[27:08] doing good but a lot of people lost
[27:10] their homes lost their lives uh got a
[27:14] testimony of course you know brother
[27:15] Roger Collins it's been over 40 years in
[27:17] Fort Myer has friends and I still have a
[27:19] good friend uh charismatic Minister back
[27:22] there got a good testimony from him in a
[27:24] little bit but
[27:25] um he said to please pray there's a lot
[27:28] of places down there they're not having
[27:30] church today a lot of places can't have
[27:32] church so let's remember those lost
[27:34] their homes lost their livelihoods
[27:37] even even they sent out something in Mr
[27:40] that said that we could help those
[27:42] people because they're not going to be
[27:43] able to work for a while because you
[27:45] just can't get around so please remember
[27:48] them in prayer mostly in Florida of
[27:50] course Southwest Florida some in
[27:52] Northeast and then of course South
[27:54] Carolina and North Carolina but from
[27:56] what I've heard most everything there is
[27:57] okay but certainly Fort Myer
[28:00] Sanibel Sanibel Island Fort Myer beach I
[28:05] don't know if you've seen pictures
[28:06] YouTube's whatever they just were
[28:09] basically wiped off they just don't
[28:11] exist anymore they're going to have to
[28:13] if they decide to I'm sure they will
[28:15] rebuild but it was really really bad
[28:20] our friend his name's Johnny uh the
[28:23] charismatic minister in Fort Myer he's
[28:25] North Fort Myers Church uh that brother
[28:28] Rogers been friends with many years and
[28:30] actually he I actually have ministered
[28:32] for him myself before uh when I was down
[28:35] there uh he said it was pretty bad
[28:39] uh I don't mean this to sound bad but
[28:42] just so you understand he said there
[28:43] were he said there were bodies floating
[28:45] in the water
[28:46] around so it was pretty bad so again
[28:49] please remember them in prayer that's
[28:51] very uh top-notch uh top of the list
[28:56] prayer requests I'm sure you have been
[28:57] but please remember that if you would
[28:59] sister Norma has a request please pray
[29:01] for my aunt and cousin who both have
[29:05] cancer
[29:06] Mark is very sick and cannot eat any
[29:10] cannot eat any longer my my Aunt Wanda
[29:14] still has cancer they uh they both have
[29:18] had
[29:19] chemo I guess chemotherapy yeah uh
[29:24] uh but it is apparently it's not working
[29:27] for Mark they need a miracle
[29:30] let's remember
[29:32] Mark Rwanda in prayer if you would today
[29:35] also Danny has prayer request here says
[29:38] on Thursday I was reading my Bible and
[29:40] all of a sudden I heard my neighbor
[29:41] upstairs start banging or it sounded
[29:44] like he was dropping things on the floor
[29:45] which you have heard sound doesn't make
[29:48] any sense especially him being an
[29:49] elderly man he has a tendency to do this
[29:53] even late at night he is not
[29:55] approachable and living in an upstairs
[29:58] apartment should be more considerate
[30:01] prayers that eventually I can
[30:04] live somewhere else so amen so Danny's
[30:07] asking the Lord would just provide a
[30:09] place for brother Danny another place to
[30:11] live
[30:12] don't mean to burst your bubble but it
[30:15] does not net grass isn't always greener
[30:17] on the other side when you're an
[30:18] apartment
[30:19] uh but the Lord knows and he can survive
[30:21] amen I know his sister Julie has had a
[30:24] just quite a battle uh with people
[30:26] around there and they're not supposed to
[30:28] be smoking in her apartment complex but
[30:30] they do comes into a patio in their
[30:34] apartment and uh it's it's it's pretty
[30:38] bad so please remember her in prayer too
[30:41] amen those are prayer requests that has
[30:43] anyone else have anything in your heart
[30:47] USS continue to remember my
[30:52] my stepdaughter Jill was really going
[30:56] through a lot and I know the Lord's
[31:00] dealing with her and she knows she's
[31:03] told her mom I know I need to get back
[31:06] to the Lord amen praise the Lord amen
[31:12] praise the Lord very true that's
[31:14] remembered you in prayer
[31:17] and spoken request on your mind

[36:40] Jesus you can be seated if you like
[36:46] brother Roger also told me
[36:49] uh testimony that our friend Johnny
[36:51] there uh that like I said the
[36:54] charismatic Minister there in Fort Myer
[36:57] him and his wife were living they live
[37:00] in Fort Myers of course North Fort Myer
[37:01] and he said the water was coming up to
[37:03] their house and it was starting to come
[37:05] up to the stoop and they were praying
[37:06] and praying and praying and nothing
[37:08] changed the water just kept coming and
[37:11] kept coming they kept praying kept
[37:12] praying nothing changed
[37:14] drop right up to the door
[37:16] and he said honey let's just let's just
[37:18] lift our hands and start worshiping god
[37:20] let's just lift our hands and start
[37:22] thanking him and praising him and he
[37:24] said as soon as they started doing that
[37:26] the water started going back down he
[37:29] said it was the only house in their
[37:31] neighborhood that didn't happen have two
[37:32] feet of water in the living room only
[37:35] house amen praise the Lord sometimes it
[37:39] just you just stop and take a moment you
[37:41] know we get so focused on the prayer
[37:43] part of it if we forget about the
[37:45] worship part of it and the thankfulness
[37:46] of it and I thought my that's such a
[37:49] great lesson you know you just keep
[37:51] praying and keep praying and just kept
[37:52] getting worse and worse but then they
[37:53] just thank God and it stopped started
[37:56] going back in the only house it was like
[37:58] that I said that's a wonderful testimony
[38:00] I want to tell that so praise the Lord

[45:19] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 in the
[45:22] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[45:24] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[45:27] void and darkness upon the face of the
[45:29] deep the spirit of God moved upon the
[45:32] face of the waters
[45:33] could be seated if you like
[45:35] go with me again also over back to
[45:37] Leviticus chapter 23.
[45:43] Lord willing try to finish up today
[45:45] that Feast of atonement day of atonement
[45:49] Feast of atonement that we have here
[45:52] uh chapter 23 beginning with verse 26
[45:56] that day of atonement that we know
[45:59] contains within it the six-fold purpose
[46:01] of Gabriel's Vision to Daniel which will
[46:04] also speak on but we went through the
[46:07] first three of the six there we want to
[46:09] finish up that last three today with the
[46:12] help of the Lord now Leviticus chapter
[46:15] 23 verse 26 and the Lord's speaking of
[46:17] Moses saying also on the 10th day of
[46:21] this seventh month there shall be a day
[46:22] of atonement
[46:24] it shall be in holy convocation unto you
[46:26] and ye shall afflict your souls and
[46:29] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[46:31] Lord remember again it's the day of
[46:33] atonement to atone to make right the
[46:36] wrongs that had been done so to atone
[46:39] for something is to make something wrong
[46:41] right an apology does it things like
[46:44] that that make the wrong right that's
[46:46] why now in this and only this Feast are
[46:51] they afflicting their souls see
[46:54] um and ye shall do no uh no work in that
[46:57] day for it is a day of atonement to make
[46:59] an atonement for you before the Lord
[47:02] your God for whatsoever Soul it be that
[47:06] shall not be afflicted in that same day
[47:08] he shall be cut off from among his
[47:10] people and whatsoever sold it be that
[47:12] doeth any work in that same day the same
[47:15] soul will I destroy from among his
[47:17] people you shall do no manner of work it
[47:19] shall be a statute forever throughout
[47:22] your Generations in all your dwellings
[47:24] it shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest
[47:25] you shall afflict your souls in the
[47:28] ninth day of the month that even uh from
[47:30] even unto even shall ye celebrate your
[47:33] Sabbath amen now let's go over to Daniel
[47:37] uh where we left off the last time of
[47:40] looking at Gabriel's six-fold Vision to
[47:43] Daniel in Daniel chapter 9. verse 24
[47:46] which contains each of the six full
[47:50] purpose now as we get to this it was
[47:52] something that came on my heart the
[47:53] other day that we need to look for
[47:55] Saints because uh things are getting
[47:57] close
[47:59] um you know
[48:01] there's a lot of disturbance going on
[48:03] and there's a lot of distraction there's
[48:05] a lot of distraction in this country but
[48:08] there's some very significant
[48:10] international events taking place
[48:12] we know that economically uh there's a
[48:16] country trying to take over the United
[48:18] States trying to take over the world
[48:19] China is trying to take over the world
[48:21] they're doing a pretty good job of it
[48:23] too and including this country but my
[48:26] mind in all that rhetoric goes right
[48:28] back to what brother Branham said
[48:30] brother random said what watch Russia
[48:32] didn't say China talked about China but
[48:35] they but the but the prophecy that came
[48:38] forth was watch Russia see so then my
[48:41] eyes tend to go away from that back over
[48:43] to there you know this week
[48:45] this week a development took place where
[48:48] the North Street pipeline going
[48:50] underneath the one of the Seas I forgot
[48:52] what it was uh suffered a an eruption uh
[48:58] it was well for lack of better
[49:00] terminology it apparently was destroyed
[49:02] uh somebody detonated a bomb or
[49:05] something and blew a part of the
[49:07] pipeline up so now all of that natural
[49:10] gas is coming out you can see it they
[49:12] showed on if you look at YouTube or you
[49:14] can look it up online you see this all
[49:16] that gas is bubbling up now in a big
[49:19] huge circle it's it's huge uh that's
[49:22] coming up uh
[49:24] some people are saying Putin did it some
[49:29] people are saying the United States did
[49:31] but
[49:33] because of this in the past couple of
[49:36] weeks Putin has amassed seven bomber
[49:40] jets that are capable of carrying
[49:42] nuclear warheads close to either Ukraine
[49:47] so when I hear watch Russia and I see
[49:50] these things happening and I know what
[49:52] the destruction of this country is
[49:53] coming to it perks me up a little bit I
[49:56] just wanted to let you know uh
[49:59] this this thing is real it is at the
[50:03] door it's coming to a head yes and I
[50:06] think very quickly we think oh there's
[50:08] the Skirmish Russian Ukraine and blah
[50:10] blah blah we're fine and we're you know
[50:12] we're paying ten dollars per gallon of
[50:13] gas that's probably more of Biden's
[50:16] world uh fossil fuels than anything but
[50:19] um you know people we don't don't think
[50:23] a whole lot about it but when things
[50:24] like this happen it perks me up because
[50:27] I know what a prophet said and when I
[50:31] make that and bring that together uh it
[50:34] it it it brings to my heart a dire
[50:36] warning that I've given to you uh and
[50:39] not a warning in so much that uh uh you
[50:43] know we're looking it we're that's
[50:45] ushering with us you're in the time that
[50:47] we're looking for because when when
[50:50] the wrong man's in office which very
[50:52] well could be when that man pushes that
[50:54] button which is very well could be
[50:57] um it's going to be done because the
[51:00] bride is going to be gone before that
[51:01] happens yes we still got a California
[51:04] going under uh it's just right here
[51:07] saying so I'm just I'm just telling you
[51:10] of things that the Lord has put on my
[51:12] heart to tell you uh it's very close if
[51:16] anybody's gonna drop a bomb or bombs on
[51:19] this country to border the Border Coast
[51:21] to Coast it's not going to be China it's
[51:23] going to be Russia and if Russia in any
[51:26] way
[51:27] it Putin I mean he's such a prideful guy
[51:30] he I mean
[51:32] even if his army gets beat to a pulp
[51:35] he'll keep sending them in he doesn't
[51:37] care he'll keep saying we're annexing
[51:39] parts of Ukraine when they're running
[51:41] for their lives because he's just that
[51:44] prideful and if he knew or if it come
[51:47] out in intelligence that we blew up that
[51:50] Pipeline and destroyed his part of his
[51:53] uh cash flow uh
[51:58] I wouldn't put it past him right my
[52:00] point is not to scare you but to realize
[52:03] we're close friends in my opinion we're
[52:06] just that close so yeah amen be ready
[52:08] that's the main thing be ready be ready
[52:11] at any time now Daniel uh we've gone
[52:14] back to Daniel chapter nine
[52:16] we want to go over the last three of the
[52:20] six-fold meaning purpose of Gabriel's
[52:22] Vision visit to Daniel
[52:25] so in the 24th verse let's just read it
[52:27] again
[52:29] Daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon
[52:33] thy people and upon thy holy city now
[52:36] notice we talked about that last time
[52:38] and you can read on down you find out
[52:40] where it gets cut off the Messiah gets
[52:42] cut off to the middle and the the last
[52:44] three and a half of the 70 of Revelation
[52:47] 11 Revelation 12 so many places it talks
[52:50] about that three and a half years of
[52:53] tribulation time uh but this is
[52:57] determined upon his people for this
[53:00] six-fold purpose to finish the
[53:02] transgression now you remember what that
[53:03] was that was the blindness in part to
[53:06] Israel Amen to finish that transgression
[53:09] to lift the scales to make an end of sin
[53:12] what was the sin sin is unbelief they
[53:14] didn't believe their Messiah right when
[53:17] this is to come Christ and they realize
[53:19] once the transgression is done the
[53:22] blindness is removed they realize who he
[53:24] is then the sin will be done away
[53:27] because they'll believe they're Messiah
[53:29] they'll know who he is they say we uh he
[53:32] said like we read last time where'd you
[53:34] get those scars in the house of my
[53:35] friends they realized what they did to
[53:37] their Messiah
[53:38] make an end of sin end of unbelief to
[53:41] make reconciliation to reconcile for the
[53:45] iniquity that was done and remember the
[53:47] iniquity uh they they recognized Christ
[53:50] the iniquity was doing something they
[53:52] should not have done and when they cried
[53:54] let his blood be on us and our children
[53:56] it has been ever since but there's going
[53:59] to be an end to that amen when God is
[54:02] he's lifting off the Gentile bride he's
[54:04] still moving though he's still moving
[54:06] amongst us but when it's fully gone and
[54:08] over on the Jews the bride goes to the
[54:10] marriage supper God will deal with them
[54:12] in that way all of these will be removed
[54:14] from the Jews because they're still his
[54:16] people amen now we'll get to the I'll
[54:20] read the rest of it but then that's
[54:21] where we ended off last time making
[54:24] reconciliation for iniquity to bring in
[54:27] Everlasting righteousness well that
[54:29] sounds good just to hear it amen
[54:31] Everlasting righteousness and to seal up
[54:34] the vision and prophecy and to anoint
[54:37] the most holy to anoint the most holy
[54:40] which puts us where we're going at the
[54:43] end of this series The Most Holy being
[54:46] the New Jerusalem amen now let's go back
[54:49] to uh that bring in Everlasting
[54:51] righteousness that's number four of the
[54:53] sixth part number four bring in
[54:55] Everlasting righteousness now obviously
[54:59] righteousness is a state of how things
[55:02] should be now not things how they should
[55:06] be in my eyes or your eyes or what the
[55:09] government says or what any person says
[55:11] but righteousness is the things that
[55:14] should be in their ought to be
[55:15] conditioned according to God
[55:17] in his eyes not ours so if we look at
[55:21] righteousness of something as saying
[55:23] well it's something that I meet a
[55:25] standard that I made well that's not
[55:27] righteousness but if you meet the
[55:29] standard that God made which by his
[55:31] blood we can then you become in your
[55:34] ought to be conditioned as God saw you
[55:36] from before the foundation of the world
[55:38] in his own mind just like brother Noah
[55:41] was preaching to us last week we talked
[55:43] and and recognized that thought of God
[55:47] that thought of God that God knew you
[55:50] before you were ever formed God knew you
[55:53] before this world was ever come into
[55:55] existence God knew you because you were
[55:57] part of him you were in his mind amen
[55:59] the intellectual property as I've said
[56:02] so many times you know in this country
[56:03] when you write something down or you
[56:06] write a book or you make a song or or
[56:08] music or something if that becomes your
[56:11] intellectual property because it's
[56:13] something that was an original fault of
[56:15] yours or an original song or or some
[56:19] kind of original music or note I know
[56:21] that there's even been groups that have
[56:24] sued other people because they came up
[56:27] with perceived presumably
[56:30] a Ken note rhythm
[56:34] that that it was a part of their song
[56:36] Whatever It Is uh just like a ten note
[56:39] Rhythm and somebody come with that 10
[56:42] note Rhythm or something in their song
[56:44] without permission
[56:46] that person or that group that came up
[56:48] with that can sue those people and say
[56:50] they stole this song from us or the
[56:53] lyrics or something like that that's why
[56:55] we have to have copyrights for a lot of
[56:57] the songs that we've seen here that we
[56:59] run Micah does that of course we get the
[57:02] copier we have to have a copyright
[57:04] license to sing some of these songs
[57:05] because now some of them belong to
[57:08] public that we don't have to that
[57:10] anybody can sing at any time but to do
[57:13] it right and it's streaming and to do it
[57:15] uh legally we have to pay uh certain
[57:18] rights to be able to sing certain songs
[57:20] because if we sing certain songs that we
[57:23] don't have rights to that uh that the
[57:26] originator that song hears and we sing
[57:28] it without his permission we can be sued
[57:30] for that
[57:31] so it's in this country uh now why a
[57:35] person would do that for the Lord and
[57:36] not make it public I don't know but
[57:38] that's that's another thing but you
[57:40] understand it came from their mind it
[57:44] was something that originated thoughts
[57:45] that originated from their mind well
[57:47] that's just exactly who we are we are
[57:50] the thoughts that come originated from
[57:52] God's mind we are the intellectual
[57:54] property of God the thoughts of God made
[57:58] manifest
[57:59] amen so in that place and we come into a
[58:02] sin body into the world but in God's
[58:05] Mind through God's eyes to be righteous
[58:09] by the blood of Jesus Christ puts us
[58:11] back in that position that's what
[58:13] righteousness is
[58:15] in its ought to be conditioned when God
[58:18] created the Garden of Eden it was
[58:20] exactly the way he wanted to be when he
[58:23] put Adam here it was exactly the way he
[58:25] wanted to be when he took Eve out of
[58:27] Adam it was exactly the way God wanted
[58:29] to be until sin came and entered into
[58:31] God
[58:32] that's when it fell that's when it
[58:34] that's when it left its righteous place
[58:38] and felt below a righteous standard it
[58:42] was no longer in the position it was
[58:44] supposed to be in and then it's gone on
[58:45] ever since we come into this world just
[58:48] like that
[58:50] shaped and iniquity come the world
[58:52] speaking lines amen because of our
[58:55] because of our uh
[58:58] uh Mom and Daddy Eve Adam and Eve see so
[59:02] we didn't do it but we came into it but
[59:05] God sent Jesus with his blood to redeem
[59:07] us that we wouldn't have to be in that
[59:09] Fallen condition so we again through his
[59:12] blood could come and be in that
[59:14] righteous position that God saw us in
[59:17] before the foundation of the world to
[59:20] put it back in its ought to be
[59:21] conditioned so when he's talking about
[59:23] to Institute an everlasting
[59:27] righteousness it means that it's going
[59:29] to be a righteousness that is unwavering
[59:33] or unending an everlasting righteousness
[59:36] so we are going to a place and he is
[59:39] taking us his bride and his children the
[59:42] Jew to that place where it will be in
[59:45] his perfect ought to be conditioned
[59:47] continually no more Fallen nature no
[59:51] more sin no more unbelief it'll be
[59:54] Everlasting in its perfect place that
[59:57] God had in his mind before the
[59:59] foundation of the world
[1:00:01] Everlasting it institutes that
[1:00:04] Everlasting righteousness now we as the
[1:00:07] Gentiles have already entered into that
[1:00:09] because we believe Christ we believe and
[1:00:13] accept the blood that he shed for us and
[1:00:15] made that atonement for us but they did
[1:00:17] it so there has to be an everlasting
[1:00:20] righteousness come in for them so that
[1:00:23] they can receive the same thing that we
[1:00:25] know and have today
[1:00:27] so it enters into that Everlasting
[1:00:29] righteousness now a couple of uh
[1:00:31] scriptures I want to read
[1:00:33] uh to back this Revelation chapter 20.
[1:00:41] Revelation chapter 20. and we know
[1:00:44] for the fall of the Garden of Eden we
[1:00:47] know even from heaven
[1:00:49] go to revelation 12. we even know even
[1:00:51] from heaven when Lucifer deceived a
[1:00:55] third of the angels in heaven to believe
[1:00:57] his life and was cast down on Earth
[1:01:00] began there not just here it began there
[1:01:04] Satan the devil
[1:01:09] Revelation chapter 20. so the only way
[1:01:12] to Institute that is to get rid of the
[1:01:16] unbelief
[1:01:17] to get rid of the sin
[1:01:19] Revelation 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel
[1:01:22] come down from heaven
[1:01:25] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[1:01:28] a great chain in his hand
[1:01:31] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[1:01:34] serpent which is the devil and Satan and
[1:01:37] bound him a thousand years so we can
[1:01:40] know that if that origination of sin
[1:01:44] Satan who is the author uh and finisher
[1:01:47] he's the the father of Lies I should say
[1:01:50] he's the father of life that from him
[1:01:54] was the beginning or the instituting of
[1:01:57] the falling from a righteous condition
[1:02:01] so now if he will be bound a thousand
[1:02:04] years and brother Brown tells us he will
[1:02:05] be bound because there'll be no subjects
[1:02:07] for him to work in right he'll be bound
[1:02:09] for a thousand years then they're
[1:02:13] they're that Millennium time then can be
[1:02:17] considered a place of righteousness
[1:02:19] right a place that will be as it
[1:02:23] ought to be amen actually brother random
[1:02:26] said all wrongs that have been done on
[1:02:27] here will be made right there right amen
[1:02:30] all wrongs will be made right why
[1:02:32] because it's exactly the way God
[1:02:34] intended it to be from the fall in the
[1:02:36] Garden of Eden till today it'll be
[1:02:38] rewrite a thousand years
[1:02:41] cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:02:43] shut him up
[1:02:45] and set a seal upon him that he should
[1:02:48] deceive the Nations no more praise God
[1:02:51] but now he's got a little wrinkle here
[1:02:54] till the Thousand Years should be
[1:02:57] fulfilled and after that he must be
[1:03:01] loosed for a little season now later on
[1:03:04] in this study I I I will probably I
[1:03:07] believe this
[1:03:09] to the the
[1:03:10] place of discussing this and more in
[1:03:14] depth so I won't do it today
[1:03:16] and I would be honest with you this this
[1:03:18] puzzled me for the longest time
[1:03:21] but that Satan would be loosed after the
[1:03:24] Millennium Satan will be loosed for a
[1:03:26] little season after the Millennium or at
[1:03:28] the end of the millennium
[1:03:30] for a little season you'll be loose
[1:03:34] um
[1:03:35] let me just
[1:03:38] well I'll leave it there but I want to
[1:03:40] talk about because that what that's what
[1:03:42] brings in Gog and Magog and of course
[1:03:45] god reigns fire and brimstone and
[1:03:48] destroys all the come up against the
[1:03:51] children of God and then the white
[1:03:53] Throne judgment but he's loose but for
[1:03:55] that thousand years my point here is
[1:03:58] that for that thousand years there will
[1:04:00] be that place that state of Purity
[1:04:03] Holiness righteousness
[1:04:06] and it's ought to be conditioned amen no
[1:04:10] more aches and pains uh no more
[1:04:13] eyeglasses uh no more dentists and
[1:04:15] doctors and uh pediatricians no no more
[1:04:19] ambulances no more Sirens no more police
[1:04:21] uh no more guns no more killing no more
[1:04:25] grades it'll be in it's ought to be
[1:04:27] perfect righteous condition and I think
[1:04:30] that people in this world today say oh
[1:04:32] that's not going to be fun I said that's
[1:04:34] going to be the best place ever to be
[1:04:36] who it who in their right mind was not
[1:04:39] want to dwell in a place like that right
[1:04:42] amen you enjoy hearing gunshots you
[1:04:45] enjoy having ambulances and going to the
[1:04:48] hospital and worrying about sickness and
[1:04:50] having to pay for insurance and you you
[1:04:52] enjoy hearing about these floods and
[1:04:54] people dying is that something you enjoy
[1:04:57] does that sound like fun no
[1:04:59] there's going to be a place of
[1:05:01] righteousness yes
[1:05:03] that God institutes that's perfect amen
[1:05:08] praise the Lord now after that thousand
[1:05:11] years he's loosed but then look what
[1:05:13] happens we can read on but let's go down
[1:05:16] to verse 10.
[1:05:18] after the end of Gog and Magog the white
[1:05:21] Throne judgment
[1:05:23] the devil verse 10 and the devil that
[1:05:26] deceived them was cast into the lake of
[1:05:29] fire and brimstone where the Beast and
[1:05:32] the false prophet are and shall be
[1:05:35] tormented day and night forever and ever
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:41] Everlasting righteousness the whole
[1:05:44] point of this wasn't focused we weren't
[1:05:47] we the whole point of this series wasn't
[1:05:49] focusing on the Millennium the whole
[1:05:52] point of this series is focusing on the
[1:05:54] new city the New Jerusalem that City
[1:05:57] come down adorned as a bride for a
[1:06:00] husband that's the focus and that Focus
[1:06:03] brings us to that to an everlasting
[1:06:06] righteousness after
[1:06:09] sin the lies the degradation all that
[1:06:13] Satan brings deception is thrown into
[1:06:16] the Lake of Fire
[1:06:17] amen the false prophet the Beast with
[1:06:20] him and to be tormented day and night
[1:06:22] forever and ever
[1:06:24] praise God well that's
[1:06:26] that that's God's doing to do that but
[1:06:29] the bride will be in that place of
[1:06:31] righteousness Holiness Everlasting
[1:06:33] righteousness let's think of what
[1:06:35] habakkuk says in habakkuk chapter 2. now
[1:06:39] it's also uh in Isaiah 11 9 says a lot
[1:06:43] the same way
[1:06:46] Isaiah 11 9 but we're going to go to
[1:06:48] habakkuk we hardly ever go to habakkuk
[1:06:51] so I found the opportunity so verse 2 or
[1:06:55] chapter 2 verse 14.
[1:06:58] habakkuk 214 again you can find this
[1:07:01] saying in in Isaiah 11 9.
[1:07:05] but let's look it's a little different
[1:07:07] but it's basically says the same thing
[1:07:09] and by this scripture you'll understand
[1:07:11] why I had the first why the Lord put the
[1:07:14] first song We sang on my heart today for
[1:07:17] the Earth shall be filled with the
[1:07:19] knowledge of what the glory of the Lord
[1:07:23] not just the knowledge of the Lord but a
[1:07:25] knowledge of the glory of the Lord as
[1:07:28] the waters covered the sea amen the
[1:07:31] Earth shall be filled with the knowledge
[1:07:34] of the glory of the Lord
[1:07:36] Everlasting righteousness praise the
[1:07:39] Lord that's what God brings in for this
[1:07:42] fifth of this fourth part of that
[1:07:45] six-fold purpose now
[1:07:47] bringing in Everlasting righteousness
[1:07:50] sailing away Satan
[1:07:53] amen which is the
[1:07:55] Satan is the unbelief sealing Satan
[1:07:58] awake not just in the Thousand Years but
[1:08:00] also in that Lake of Fire forever and
[1:08:03] ever very much praise the Lord
[1:08:04] Everlasting righteous now the fifth one
[1:08:07] the fifth one is to seal up the vision
[1:08:09] and prophecy
[1:08:12] seal up the vision and prophecy that's
[1:08:15] the fifth one now a seal as we probably
[1:08:19] already know is denotes a finished work
[1:08:23] I I got a couple of quotes I could read
[1:08:26] here uh I I can just read them real
[1:08:28] quick uh a seal something that you seal
[1:08:32] up uh mothers wives uh well probably
[1:08:37] maybe all of us at this point you ever
[1:08:39] use Saran Wrap
[1:08:41] or something to its equivalent
[1:08:45] and you you take a bowl of something you
[1:08:48] want to stay fresher and you know it's
[1:08:50] not going to stay fresh fresh because
[1:08:51] there's air in already but you take it
[1:08:54] and you seal that you put that saran
[1:08:56] wrap and you seal it up you seal it to
[1:08:59] do what now this is mine and we know
[1:09:01] it's a finished work a seal actually a
[1:09:04] sealed denotes several different things
[1:09:06] it can do no ownership
[1:09:08] we know brother Ram talked about the
[1:09:09] seal that was put on the railroad car
[1:09:11] that was ownership when that seal was
[1:09:13] put on that that railroad car was
[1:09:15] inspected and it was found to be right
[1:09:18] and a seal was put on it it meant that
[1:09:20] that plate that seal said that that cart
[1:09:23] was inspected it was found to be perfect
[1:09:25] and it's the ownership of this company
[1:09:28] so it does denote ownership it denotes a
[1:09:31] finished work it's a seal because what's
[1:09:34] inside is perfect
[1:09:36] amen it's a seal it also denotes uh that
[1:09:40] finished work it also
[1:09:42] um
[1:09:42] uh it also denotes a protection
[1:09:46] which is kind of what I was getting to
[1:09:48] with the Saran Wrap you try to protect
[1:09:51] food with with Saran Wrap you seal it so
[1:09:54] it's protected I've seen uh these
[1:09:57] gadgets they have where you can put a
[1:10:00] piece of meat between two things and you
[1:10:02] run it through this machine or something
[1:10:03] it just sucks all the air out or
[1:10:05] something it seals that uh that right
[1:10:08] around the meat and all it takes all the
[1:10:10] air and everything out of it's supposed
[1:10:12] to keep the meat fresher longer you can
[1:10:14] freeze it and it'll be just like new it
[1:10:16] it isn't but it's supposed to be just
[1:10:19] like new they put that a sealant in
[1:10:21] there is to protect it so a seal is also
[1:10:24] protection that's what I've got for this
[1:10:27] now
[1:10:28] Beyond honestly and I'll let you know
[1:10:31] this before I started most of this since
[1:10:33] you've if you have gone and listened to
[1:10:35] Gabriel's six-fold Vision to Daniel that
[1:10:38] brother Brown spoke on uh a lot of what
[1:10:40] I have here there's some exceptions that
[1:10:42] the Lord's give me in studying it but a
[1:10:45] lot of that came from that message and
[1:10:48] and Daniel's 70 weeks so and others but
[1:10:51] that's the main place but he doesn't
[1:10:54] talk a whole lot about the seal up the
[1:10:56] vision and prophecy and it was it was
[1:10:58] kind of a a
[1:11:01] something that was a state of sort of a
[1:11:04] state of confusion to me I actually when
[1:11:07] I got to this the other this is a month
[1:11:09] or so ago and I sat at my desk
[1:11:11] and I sat back and I said Lord what do I
[1:11:14] say about this it just it just didn't
[1:11:17] ring with me
[1:11:19] I I just I needed some more help and I
[1:11:23] asked the Lord and then and you know
[1:11:26] nothing came right away and I read some
[1:11:28] more and I studied some more and I
[1:11:30] skipped over it and and I come back and
[1:11:32] and all of a sudden the Lord dropped to
[1:11:35] me that the significance of the seal
[1:11:38] the significance and importance of the
[1:11:41] Seal of a seal not just that seal but a
[1:11:45] seal
[1:11:46] and then it just became clear
[1:11:49] uh a seal is has the various meanings to
[1:11:54] it purposes to it but this one more than
[1:11:57] anything to me was this seal was for
[1:12:00] protection now I I read these quotes in
[1:12:03] the breach
[1:12:04] he said um he said while the scriptures
[1:12:07] are open the Holy Spirit here itself the
[1:12:10] Holy Spirit itself is a seal the holy
[1:12:13] spirit is a seal
[1:12:15] the holy spirit is a seal a seal
[1:12:18] signifies what a finished work amen
[1:12:20] which is true right that is true
[1:12:24] a finished work the holy spirit being a
[1:12:27] seal to the individual now in the
[1:12:29] seventh seal oddly enough the seventh
[1:12:32] seal
[1:12:33] uh brother man talks about
[1:12:35] uh Adventist brother the Seal of God is
[1:12:39] keeping the Sabbath day
[1:12:40] he said you know that but I want uh one
[1:12:44] Speck of scripture on it to show that
[1:12:46] the sabbaths are keeping the Sabbath is
[1:12:47] the Seal of God
[1:12:49] but if you read Ephesians 4 which we'll
[1:12:51] go to in a moment it says grieve not the
[1:12:54] holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[1:12:56] until the day of your Redemption yes sir
[1:13:00] when that meditorial work is done and
[1:13:03] you are come Christ comes to redeem his
[1:13:06] own you are sealed not till the next
[1:13:09] revelation Revival when you're once
[1:13:13] sealed with the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:13:15] finished work
[1:13:16] that God has received you and there's no
[1:13:20] getting away from it God has received
[1:13:22] you sealed his spirit in there finished
[1:13:25] work
[1:13:25] but it's also a protection and that's
[1:13:28] the thing that God Ran true to me or
[1:13:30] rang true to me look here Daniel chapter
[1:13:33] 12 would probably may have been a Daniel
[1:13:35] there but Daniel chapter 12
[1:13:38] it speaks of Daniel 12 Revelation 10
[1:13:42] will go to
[1:13:43] you can also look at uh as you're
[1:13:45] looking at Daniel 12 uh
[1:13:48] the the the the the Seal of circumcision
[1:13:51] that God gave to Abraham
[1:13:53] what was the purpose of the Seal of
[1:13:56] circumcision it was considered a seal a
[1:13:59] circumcision a something that God was
[1:14:01] instructing him to do that denoted that
[1:14:05] the work had been done
[1:14:07] the work had been completed the
[1:14:09] obedience to God had been done amen
[1:14:12] obedience that's what God looks for
[1:14:14] saying he's looking for The Obedience he
[1:14:17] wants obedience from his children and
[1:14:19] this was this this was this seal was a
[1:14:21] seal that God gave Abraham as as a sign
[1:14:25] the work had been completed
[1:14:28] the the uh the uh the promise was in
[1:14:31] effect amen that God had given them the
[1:14:34] promise was in effect but now Daniel
[1:14:36] chapter 12 look at this Daniel 12 4.
[1:14:39] but thou old Daniel shut up the words
[1:14:43] and seal the book even to the time of
[1:14:46] the end many shall run to and fro and
[1:14:49] knowledge shall be increased So Daniel
[1:14:51] saw something or was interested in
[1:14:53] something that God said seal up because
[1:14:56] it's not time
[1:14:58] well what would that what was that seal
[1:15:00] to do
[1:15:02] if it was to protect that vision and
[1:15:05] prophecy for becoming known to those
[1:15:08] that it should not be made known to it
[1:15:11] was also to protect its entirety for the
[1:15:15] time frame of when it was supposed to be
[1:15:17] revealed to God's people amen so it was
[1:15:21] a protection
[1:15:22] the sealed it wasn't necessary well it
[1:15:25] is a finished work because God's work is
[1:15:27] a finished work is just unfolding itself
[1:15:29] God's just playing it out in his mind it
[1:15:32] is a finished work but we know that that
[1:15:34] was to continue to unfold itself even to
[1:15:37] the day that we live
[1:15:39] so to say it was finished that God was
[1:15:41] no longer going to deal with it was not
[1:15:42] accurate but it was to protect
[1:15:46] God was protecting his word amen from
[1:15:50] those who weren't supposed to get a hold
[1:15:51] of it just like the uh just like the the
[1:15:55] the garters of the Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:15:57] John guarding the way to the to the to
[1:16:00] the truth there was there was a seal
[1:16:04] that was to protect it from getting to
[1:16:06] and also again the Integrity of it to
[1:16:08] keep it from coming before its time was
[1:16:11] to be amen it was for according to God
[1:16:15] to Daniel it was for the time of the end
[1:16:19] now my question to you this morning
[1:16:21] Dennis
[1:16:22] when is that time
[1:16:25] when is the time of the end
[1:16:27] I believe it's now yes I believe a
[1:16:30] prophet has come to bring that word that
[1:16:33] has been unsealed to show to this bride
[1:16:36] who she is in the day that she lives
[1:16:38] it's also exposing the enemy yes so that
[1:16:42] we recognize the enemy and all of its
[1:16:44] tactics all the way down through from
[1:16:46] the beginning of time down through the
[1:16:47] church ages amen so it was to bring for
[1:16:52] a time of the end
[1:16:54] that we are now
[1:16:56] many shall run to and fro knowledge
[1:16:58] shall increase knowledge man's knowledge
[1:17:01] not God's knowledge then I Daniel looked
[1:17:03] and behold there stood other two the one
[1:17:06] on this side of the bank at the river
[1:17:07] the other on the other side of the bank
[1:17:08] of the river one said to the man clothed
[1:17:10] in linen oh which was upon the waters of
[1:17:14] the river how long shall it be to the
[1:17:16] end of these wonders
[1:17:18] and I heard the man clothed in linen
[1:17:20] which was upon the waters of the river
[1:17:22] when he held up his right hand and his
[1:17:25] left hand unto Heaven swear by him that
[1:17:28] liveth forever that he shall be for a
[1:17:30] Time Time a times and a half and when he
[1:17:33] shall have accomplished to scatter the
[1:17:35] power of the Holy people all these
[1:17:38] things shall be finished and I heard but
[1:17:39] I understood not why did he understand
[1:17:42] not
[1:17:43] he heard it but he didn't understand it
[1:17:45] why
[1:17:46] then said I O My Lord what shall be the
[1:17:49] the end of these things and God reminds
[1:17:52] him he said go thy Way Daniel for the
[1:17:55] words are closed up
[1:17:57] that's why you don't see it that's why
[1:18:00] you can't write it that's why you can't
[1:18:02] tell it because it's sealed go your way
[1:18:05] Daniel for the words are closed up and
[1:18:08] sealed till the time of the end right it
[1:18:10] wasn't for you to know right now he saw
[1:18:14] it but he didn't understand it people
[1:18:16] read the sixth chapter of Revelations
[1:18:18] all the time but do they understand it
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:22] no it took a profit for this last day to
[1:18:25] come and God revealed to him to preach
[1:18:28] to a bride what that six what those
[1:18:31] seven seals are yes and what they mean
[1:18:34] to us because it was time look at
[1:18:37] Revelation now Revelation chapter 10.
[1:18:41] Revelation chapter 10 I'll skip the
[1:18:43] first three well we'll just go first
[1:18:45] verse Revelation 10 1 and I saw another
[1:18:47] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:18:49] clothed with a cloud the rainbow is upon
[1:18:51] his head his faces as it were the Sun
[1:18:53] the fetus pillars of Fire he had it in
[1:18:56] his hand a little book open and he said
[1:18:58] his right his right foot upon the sea is
[1:19:00] left foot upon the Earth
[1:19:02] and he cried with the loud voices when a
[1:19:04] lion roared and when he had tried seven
[1:19:07] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[1:19:10] the seven Thunders uttered their voices
[1:19:12] I was about to write
[1:19:14] the seven Thunders uttered and John was
[1:19:16] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[1:19:19] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:19:22] things with the seven Thunders uttered
[1:19:24] and write them not it wasn't even for
[1:19:27] John the revelator's time yes but it was
[1:19:30] for today yes it was for the end and
[1:19:33] this is the end it wasn't for Daniel it
[1:19:37] wasn't for John it was for a prophet
[1:19:39] William Brown to bring to a bride for
[1:19:42] this last day yes now it has been open
[1:19:45] it was protected All Through the Ages
[1:19:48] and generations yes God sealed it and
[1:19:51] protected it even from this time with
[1:19:53] John sealed and protected it was kept so
[1:19:57] that it could be brought fresh that a
[1:20:00] bride could receive it for this last day
[1:20:02] yes and that the revelation of that
[1:20:05] could enter into the heart of the People
[1:20:07] by the Holy Spirit through the words
[1:20:09] that were spoken so that it would be in
[1:20:12] our hearts a truth of God's word yes
[1:20:14] truth of God's word that seal protected
[1:20:18] it so when he says it will seal up the
[1:20:21] vision and the prophecy it's a finished
[1:20:24] work yes and it's a protection amen that
[1:20:28] seal is a protection amen that God had
[1:20:31] give for the Jews at that time so
[1:20:34] in this end time that they can receive
[1:20:39] what we receive they can know they are
[1:20:42] going to know what we know
[1:20:45] the message Jesus Christ amen the
[1:20:48] Messiah Jesus Christ God in flesh Jesus
[1:20:53] the Jews already believed that their
[1:20:55] Messiah is going to be God In the Flesh
[1:20:57] they already say that they just missed
[1:20:59] him Christ Jesus Christ being that
[1:21:02] Messiah
[1:21:03] they are
[1:21:05] like a lot of Gentiles who believe
[1:21:07] there's two of two Gods three Gods
[1:21:10] whatever they want to conjure in their
[1:21:12] mind uh Trinity or something like that
[1:21:14] but there's only one God
[1:21:16] and he was veiled in flesh when he come
[1:21:18] in the body of the Corporal body of
[1:21:20] Jesus Christ it manifests himself to the
[1:21:22] world
[1:21:23] we see it we know who he is they didn't
[1:21:25] they will
[1:21:27] amen they will praise the Lord last one
[1:21:31] last one number six
[1:21:34] the last one was to anoint the most holy
[1:21:37] to anoint the most holy now to anoint
[1:21:41] uh simply means to immerse
[1:21:45] or baptize or smear it also means to
[1:21:50] consecrate
[1:21:51] you know anointing also means to
[1:21:53] consecrate let's go over to um
[1:21:57] Leviticus chapter 8.
[1:22:01] see if I had a figure Leviticus chapter
[1:22:04] 8.
[1:22:06] it's also to consecrate now to anoint as
[1:22:10] I've said before is to baptize or to
[1:22:13] smear a liquid on or to immerse in
[1:22:17] amen that's what anoint means
[1:22:19] to baptize to consecration that's why
[1:22:25] when people talk of baptism of the Holy
[1:22:27] Ghost I understand what they're talking
[1:22:29] about but the word baptized actually
[1:22:32] only means to be immersed
[1:22:35] I'm not looking to Simply Be immersed in
[1:22:38] his spirit I want the indwelling
[1:22:40] presence of Jesus Christ himself to live
[1:22:43] in me not just immerse in it yes not
[1:22:46] just baptize or anointed in it there's a
[1:22:50] lot of people around the world today
[1:22:51] that are anointed of the Holy Ghost but
[1:22:54] there are very few people around the
[1:22:56] world who are born again and have the
[1:22:58] spirit of the literal Life of Christ
[1:23:00] Living in them
[1:23:02] that's the Holy Spirit that's the new
[1:23:05] birth amen that's where you have to be
[1:23:08] if you want to go in a Rapture a simple
[1:23:10] anointing is not going to do it a simple
[1:23:12] baptism is not going to do it that's why
[1:23:14] being baptized in water does not save
[1:23:16] you yes because it's simply an immersion
[1:23:19] amen and when you break it down to
[1:23:22] recognize what it means and brother
[1:23:24] Branham took especially in the early
[1:23:26] part of his ministry and he talked about
[1:23:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost from the
[1:23:29] Pentecostals
[1:23:31] was not the reference he was talking
[1:23:34] about from the 63 on
[1:23:37] he talked about not just a simple
[1:23:39] baptism but the indwelling presence of
[1:23:42] the Life of Christ in you
[1:23:44] not simply immersed in that not just
[1:23:47] simply baptized in it but Christ in you
[1:23:50] the hope of glory yes that's the new
[1:23:53] birth the new birth isn't an anointing
[1:23:55] the new birth is in the baptism the new
[1:23:58] birth is the dwelling the indwelling
[1:24:00] presence of the Life of Christ in you
[1:24:02] yes amen that seal was put on your soul
[1:24:06] I skipped that scripture I didn't read
[1:24:08] uh Ephesians 1 13-14 if you want to go
[1:24:11] back that that seal of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:14] God seals that Holy Spirit in there
[1:24:17] not a baptism that's not an anointing it
[1:24:21] is a consecration but it's ownership yes
[1:24:25] it means that he now accepted you and
[1:24:28] owned you as his own
[1:24:30] that's what the new birth is
[1:24:32] being born again and the Soul not just
[1:24:35] the flesh not even just the spirit but
[1:24:37] in this but in the soul but now look to
[1:24:40] anoint the most holy now the most whole
[1:24:42] let's just talk about the most holy
[1:24:44] before we get to the anointing God the
[1:24:46] most holy that we talk about look in the
[1:24:48] scripture the holy city is Jerusalem
[1:24:52] that's the holy city the holy city of
[1:24:54] Jerusalem the most holy is that City
[1:24:57] that's not the of the of the Earthly
[1:25:00] City that we know today but the New
[1:25:02] Jerusalem that God's going to set up yes
[1:25:04] that God that that City that we that
[1:25:07] we're eventually getting to Revelation
[1:25:09] 21 that new city that comes down on that
[1:25:11] pyramid-shaped mountain that's that new
[1:25:14] city the holy city the New Jerusalem
[1:25:16] that New Jerusalem is that most holy
[1:25:19] that new Tabernacle that anointing
[1:25:23] consecration of that new Tabernacle now
[1:25:26] let's look to anoint the most holy
[1:25:29] Leviticus 8.
[1:25:33] to anoint the most holy
[1:25:41] look here now and Moses took the
[1:25:44] anointing oil
[1:25:46] and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that
[1:25:49] there was therein
[1:25:51] and Sanctified them consecrated them
[1:25:55] and he sprinkled there and we know what
[1:25:58] the anointing World represents of course
[1:26:00] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:26:02] uh an annoying to the Tabernacle all
[1:26:05] that was Darien and Sanctified them
[1:26:07] consecrated them
[1:26:09] and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar
[1:26:12] seven times
[1:26:14] and Anointed The Altar in all his
[1:26:17] vessels both the labor and his foot to
[1:26:20] sanctify them
[1:26:21] and he poured of the anointing oil upon
[1:26:26] Aaron's head
[1:26:27] and anointed him to sanctify him praise
[1:26:32] the Lord it was to sanctify consecrate
[1:26:36] him what was to pour that anointing oil
[1:26:40] the representation of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:42] Christ
[1:26:44] to pour out upon his people and he
[1:26:47] poured it out upon Abraham it wasn't a
[1:26:50] time of the indwelling presence because
[1:26:52] Christ did not come so the only thing
[1:26:56] that they could do to consecrate this
[1:26:58] ministry was to pour that representative
[1:27:02] of the or of the holy spirit that
[1:27:04] anointing oil on Abraham or on Aaron
[1:27:08] to anoint him and to consecrate him
[1:27:12] praise the Lord so when this anointing
[1:27:14] of the most holy is supposed to take
[1:27:16] place is to be a consecration
[1:27:20] remember Everlasting righteousness has
[1:27:24] entered in because
[1:27:26] Satan's sin deception is all done away
[1:27:29] with
[1:27:30] and there's there's an inner and of
[1:27:34] everlasting righteousness
[1:27:37] and an and a consecration of that City
[1:27:41] that we're going to live in
[1:27:44] amen now you say how long I don't know
[1:27:47] that's up to God the Bible does not say
[1:27:50] in fact there's very little said about
[1:27:54] that new city in the scripture very
[1:27:56] little there is scripture about it but
[1:27:59] there's very little
[1:28:00] but it's but the consecration of that
[1:28:03] City the consecration of the place that
[1:28:06] we're going to live where God Jesus
[1:28:09] himself the lamb will be the light of
[1:28:11] that City it'll be positioned so that
[1:28:15] there won't be a shade spot on the
[1:28:17] entire city
[1:28:18] day and night
[1:28:20] praise the Lord amen
[1:28:23] consecration now one more
[1:28:27] I kind of just gave it away but let me
[1:28:29] uh
[1:28:30] Revelation chapter 21.
[1:28:35] I will close with this
[1:28:40] to anoint the most holy
[1:28:46] Revelation 21 22 and 23.
[1:28:56] now remember
[1:28:57] this is that City it describes
[1:28:59] Revelation 21 describes that City
[1:29:02] it says I Revelation 21 1 said I saw a
[1:29:05] new Heaven and new earth first Heaven
[1:29:07] the first search were passed away there
[1:29:09] were no more sea I John saw the holy
[1:29:12] city New Jerusalem coming down from God
[1:29:14] out of Heaven prepared as a bride a door
[1:29:16] for her husband yes praise the Lord
[1:29:19] there's an anointing a constant crating
[1:29:21] of that City that New Jerusalem that
[1:29:25] we're all going to live in look here
[1:29:27] uh verse 22 now and I saw no Temple
[1:29:31] therein
[1:29:32] for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb
[1:29:35] are the Temple of it now when there was
[1:29:38] consecration before the consecration was
[1:29:42] for the Tabernacle in the wilderness the
[1:29:44] temple the place where they met God that
[1:29:47] was to be the consecration
[1:29:50] the consecration of this place is the
[1:29:53] fact that there is no Temple there's not
[1:29:56] a Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:29:58] because God the lamb and almighty God
[1:30:02] are the Temple of this the anointing of
[1:30:05] it is God himself there is no
[1:30:08] representation
[1:30:09] there is no substitute there is no
[1:30:13] natural typing the spiritual it is God
[1:30:16] himself that is now the Temple of this
[1:30:20] city praise the Lord the consecration of
[1:30:24] this city

[1:30:31] Saints amen we're talking about the
[1:30:33] literal the literal thing and the city

[1:30:39] moon to shine in it for the glory of God
[1:30:42] did lighten it and the lamb is and the
[1:30:46] lamb is the light thereof
