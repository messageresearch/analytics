righteous god amen sometimes that righteous god calls judgment because righteousness calls for judgment but he's always good amen always good people always think of good as a pat on the back or a taking of the hand no sometimes it's a swift kick in the rear sometimes it's a little protoplasm stimulation but he's still good yes all the time everything he does he does for our good if we love him he does amen i love him with all my heart he's so good isn't he amen praise the lord we have a couple prayer requests amen to mention to you this morning amen and well i just got to take some strides

second timothy chapter 2. and then before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious lord jesus so thankful to be here again today lord thanking you for this place and for all that you've done for us thank you for being so good to us lord thank you for giving us your life thank you for showing us the way the truth the light thank you for your word lord the revelation of that word that it's a lamp into our feet and a light unto our path that keeps us going one step at a time one day at a time even sometimes one moment at a time that you lead us through this life lord but it's only you god that we want to please it's only you that we want to fulfill those desires god because my desires your desires have become my desires your ways have become my ways everything about us lord is to just do what we can to be pleasing to you father and thank you for this time of fellowship lord thank you for the service that we have these that have come lord those who may be streaming god we just pray and believe now lord that you take complete control of this service and me lord and us god to speak and to hear whatever you would have for us for to be said today god that you would have accomplished in our lives use this word to draw closer to you lord god and help us to become more like you we rebuke every demonic spirit yes jesus christ's name that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for it lord and we thank you god for those who have come those who may not be here the requests were made just lift them before you father you knew them everyone before they became requests believe god that you're going to move upon them even now fathers we call upon your name and for remaining part of this service as we commit it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen second timothy chapter 2 let's start with verse 11. ii timothy 2 11 it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness you can be seated if you like amen how about you the word just seems to become more powerful every day to me i guess it's just growing the lord and get closer to god it just becomes more and more that way i want to speak on a a fairly simple subject probably today and next sunday the lord willing uh that's how it seemed to break out yesterday when i was looking these this up and something the lord had put on my heart months ago i want to speak on the must nots uh if you remember brother branham talked about him a specific message he pointed out three specific bus knots now obviously there's uh probably there's other things that brother branham had put on or mentioned but in that one message he put those three specific especially must-nots that we must not do and those are the things that i want to get into and talk about starting today uh about those must nots uh you probably all know what they are i want to try to the lord wheeling because brother branham took and he mentioned it and he put little highlights with all three of them but he really didn't take scripture break them down and try to bring them forward in an entire message in fact i think this quote i have here says that he said let's take 10 minutes so i kind of thought that maybe the must-nots deserved a little bit more than 10 minutes but as the lord would give to us today so those must nots as you probably may remember hopefully remember if not we'll refresh your memory the memory those three must nots are we must not misinterpret we must not misplace or dislocate the word amen now that's what he's talking about the word must not misinterpret must not misplace or dislocate now today i want to talk about the misinterpret uh we'll probably take the next two that kind of actually kind of runs side by side the other two mislocate dislocate mis uh misplaced kind of runs side by side they almost sound the same really if you think misplaced dislocate kind of sounds like the same thing really isn't once you delve into it you realize what it is when you break it down it's a lot more than just uh the word itself and the little nuances that follow along with those with those must not so i want to focus today on the must not misinterpret the word because it seems like that's the place that most people get in the most trouble is misinterpreting the word now we obviously can say as brother branham said that we should not be interpreting the word anyway we just let the word come to pass but obviously as it has been that we've read it over the years and ministers have preached it over the years and thank god for a prophet that god sent a word vindicated prophet in this last day to come and tie up all those loose sins and bring that as we could say full interpretation of that word that the word falls in perfect continuity altogether because the word itself makes a picture and this picture is jesus christ and you have to have every bit of that scripture in its proper place in its proper way and made what it's supposed to be how it's supposed to look for it to all fall into line if you get any of it out of cater it just one word like in the beginning which we'll get to in a little bit just that one word we talked to last week that just one word throws the whole picture out of continuity uh you know how brother brown talked about if you if you get one little thing off you could how you could have the cow in the tree eating grass right it could be that simple but it throws the whole picture out it doesn't look right anymore and if you throw one part of the seed the bible fits so perfectly together the bible runs so perfectly congruently together that if you just get one little thing off it throws the whole picture out you throw something off in genesis you're liable to make revelation look like a mess because you've thrown it off in one place it messes it up in the other right the whole bible so it all has to run perfect the the the picture has to be exactly the way the scripture is written that's how perfect it is now you know somebody tells a story sometimes they add a little something or they take a little something away or they embellish a little something and one on a fishing trip and you know you tell the story and it's mostly correct the first time how the fish was so big and you know you tell it the 12th time and the fish is all of a sudden this big you know and you you drug it in you had to take six men to help you and all this and it went from being a little simple fish story you know because some people embellish stories but that's not the way the scripture is right so we're used to those things as humans we've probably told some of those in our lives but that's the truth but the word is not like that the word is perfect there's not one single thing out of place and every word dovetails with the other so again if you get one little thing wrong it's like brother patton putting his car together i used to do a lot of woodworking and if you got one little dovetail out of its place or backwards or or the wrong little thing just like brother daniel when he put this pulpit together i look at it a lot of times because i like woodworking and i always have it you get one little thing out of place or one little thing wrong here and then none of it fits it's like brother patent put this card together if he puts this little part or if it's the wrong part it may look like the exact part but if it's just a little skosh off and you get it it can mess up the whole engine or whatever part you're putting together the word is like that where it all has to be perfect it has to be perfectly and we'll say interpreted for it to all work exactly and look and say exactly what it's supposed to that's the only way it works so thank god for a vindicated prophet amen christ revealed in his own word now this is the scripture the the message that brother branham introduced these three must in the way he did to us is in this message christ revealed in his own word now in order to study the scripture in order to study the scripture and we all study the scripture i i trust and believe we already read or studied the scripture in order to study the scripture paul told timothy study it rightly dividing the word of god which is the truth now how is it that we can know that when we read it that it is being rightly divided obviously in the day that we're living we have a message we can read the bible and we can go back to the message or we can take the message go back to the bible and we can look and say okay we know that god used a vindicated prophet to bring this word and lay it out the way it is so maybe my understanding about this verse of scripture is wrong because it's all got to fit together so we can look at that and say well thank god for that but how do how does anyone know that they know for sure that they have rightly divided because i can promise you and you would probably agree with me that every single christian who really believes they're a devout christian every single minister especially standing behind the pulpit on this sunday morning sunday afternoon whatever it would be believes that they have rightly divided the word every bible school you go to bible schools all across the country all around the world and i guarantee you that every one of them believes that they have rightly divided the word to bring that rightly divided word to a people so that those people could bring that rightly divided word to their congregations right i'm sure they everyone they don't come in and say i'm going to purposely make this wrong i believe every one of them think that they have rightly divided the word so how can you know that that word has been in your life because we want to make this personal it's not about bible colleges or other churches or even this church it's about you it's about me so let's make it personal so how do i know that that word has been rightly divided how do i know that william branham was the prophet of god three word prophet for this last day to this generation for this for this last day brought how do we know there's only one way that dividing line that we hit on the last two sundays is the exact same dividing line that we hid in here as we do with so many other things in life and that is you must be born again you must have the holy ghost that is the only way that you can know that that word has been rightly divided right the best way to get a story into your spirit as you read it or listen to it is to get into how the author wrote it uh if it's about a ball game or something and you and you you want to actually feel like you're at that game you read something and you get into the spirit of the way it was written then you can then you can really absorb and almost feel like you were there because of of the spiritual connection well the only way that you can read the word and get the spiritual connection and the right of the dividing of that word in your life is to is to read it by the inspiration or through the one who wrote it and that is god amen and he sent his spirit to us so that we could have that spirit in us so that spirit through us can read and rightly divide it was written by men led of the holy ghost so it is read by people led of the holy ghost it's the only way yes no matter what your bible college is no matter what church denomination no matter what affiliation charismatic or message that you go to to know that that word has been rightly divided is to only know by the holy ghost that's the only way you can know it has to be a born-again experience yes if you're born again it obligates you to that word if you have the holy ghost if you are born again it obligates you to that word because it is the word it all revolves around the same thing it's jesus christ the word only way you could know paul told timothy study rightly divide that word of god which is the truth rightly divided now he didn't say interpret it he said rightly divide it praise the lord rightly divided now each age has had its place to divide that word each one now we we we major now each one from the very first church paul and iranians and martin all the way through now we made you on these last few because of the restoration point of it with luther and wesley and and pentecost and the message of the hour and and we we we majored on those but each one of those had its own message to bring forth enough of the light that shined on that word because that's the way god did it because he did it as a plant would grow as the seed falls on the ground as a torso comes forth as a stalk as a branch that's how the word has come forth and developed itself into this last day bride and where we're living today and what we develop to believe has been developed and what we know and call affectionately as the message of the hour through through through luther luther didn't have a lot of the truths that we got brought to us by uh by brother branham wesley did not have now wesley had a little more than luther but and he just took luther's justification and he brought it with him and brought that into his into his sanctification but see he didn't have what we had this day pentecost had the restoration of the gifts all that was wonderful the speaking in tongues the prophet signing the jumping dancing all that was happening the emotional emotionalism and the spirit of god moving and the power and the healings and what god was doing and moving in those people's lives i believe still is here today it's not as prevalent as it was because the spirit of god is moving off the gentiles going back to the jews so it's not as prevalent as it was but it's still here so we didn't do away with justification we when we came to sanctification we didn't do with sanctification when we came into the restoration of the yes we just brought those with us because the only way you can get to that point is to a justified and sanctified condition amen well that brother brown just took those things and just brought them right into the mess amen yes amen and every bit of that just came and all tied in together right and finalized what the word was that god was to bring to us to make that picture that picture of god and the only way to know it the only way to be a part of it the only way for it to be a part of your life is to be born again the holy ghost i don't know why the lord continually because i'll be honest when i started this study just that was not a part of my thought process but as i studied it more and more it became more and more prevalent part of what god wants to speak to us about this you must be born again having the holy ghost yeah it's it's it's not an option amen when jesus told nicodemus you must be born again he meant it he didn't just say well you know you can if you want it's up to you doesn't matter it's your choice your decision no it's not it's your decision obviously but there's only one decision to make and as you must be born again now that rightly dividing not not interpreting rightly dividing that word amen that that's that's the way the scripture writes it rightly dividing the word of god which is truth there there is three must in the scripture in using god or must not in using god's word there is three things you must not do now let's study those for the next 10 minutes here it is that's what i was thinking of three things you must not do and all out in the land wherever you are across the nation put these down in your mind if you don't have a pencil you must not do these things we tell you all the time what you must do now i'm going to tell you what you must not do now you must not misinterpret the word yes you say well i believe it means this i believe it means that it means just what it says amen it means just what it says it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would do either of these it throws the whole bible into a confusion and chaos yes must not misinterpret so let's get to that for a little bit we read some of this last week uh actually i think it was two weeks ago we didn't go so much into genesis last week this was a couple of weeks ago but let's go back to genesis chapter 3 again let's just start in the beginning start in the beginning the biggest problem that we have well the biggest problem we have is people not being born again people taking over positions of authority or teaching or ministering without having the holy ghost that's why brother branham said god man's got no business being behind a pulpit unless he's met the pillar of fire in other words he's saying he got no business up here trying to rightly divide the world without actually even being born again so that's the biggest problem but once you get beyond that a lot of the problem we have is people's beyond the holy ghost the biggest problem is is the interjecting of men's opinions yes or our human opinions now our opinions as humans uh our opinions get shaped over our lives uh i can ask your opinion of probably something simple um uh let's just say how how many of you like tacos everybody has their opinion myself i love them but myself i could count on my hand how many tacos i had till i was 14 years old i didn't have tacos in charlotte north carolina we didn't have tacos we went to some friend's house and they made them a certain way and i had a couple i could probably count on one hand until i was 14 and moved to tucson how many tacos i ate sister pads not at your head they're probably not that many in memphis either it's just so it's a different opinion so you understand your opinions are shaped as you grow and as you get under certain teachers and people of influence and you learn certain things and they they shape and mold the first people are your parents amen now i i my wife would probably go to a mexican restaurant where i would probably go to cracker barrel first and that's just probably interjecting food again but you understand how that could that could alter people's opinions uh somebody whose life has been tragically uh ended or their their their spouse or something by by gun violence is probably uh not all the time but that shapes your opinion maybe about a gun right uh and and that happens and and people's lives now where what part of the country you grow up in what parents you have what schools you went to were you homeschooled did you go to a public school all these things shape people's opinions but the and that's the problem people try to take those opinions they get from a bible school or they learned in a baptist church or a methodist church or a catholic church and they try to take all these things and stuff you hear all the social media internet and most that's just garbage that here today people try to take these things that shape their opinions and they try to bring it into the word and they try to make the word fit what their opinion is instead of instead of when you come to christ and you come to the word you guide all those things you died all your opinions you died to what you think now obviously tacos are still good that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about the scripture the word studying the word you died of those things you died to your opinion you doubted what you thought you died to what this one said or that one said or the others because it's got to be real to you by the holy ghost and that's the only way it can fit it's the only way it can fit because you cannot interject it with anything else the word cannot be injected with any leaven at all no unbelief no doubt no opinions from over here no denominations over here and no well there's three gods well that's okay you know the rest of what he says is all right sorry it doesn't work that way you've got to die to that amen to be able to rightly divide the word that's a lot of the biggest problems people have they interject their own opinions and those opinions are developed over years and years and maybe from a pastor or from a minister from a bible school or from my parents did this my great parent my great great grandparents were methodists all die methodists that's that that's what people's that's how your opinions are developed see that they they they come to but the problem is when they start interfering with the revelation of the word to you it when they start interfering with the rightly dividing of that word to your heart to your life when god tries to show you something friend if god's showing it to you you look at it and you have to find in the scripture how it fits together i do that with the message there's stuff i still have on the shelf but i do that with the message i rightly divide that message and it's got to be with the word because if it's not it's wrong i don't care who it is right i've never found it to be wrong but it's got to fit that word genesis 1 to revelation 22. if it doesn't it's wrong it can't fit my opinion it's got to fit what the word is for the picture to stay complete so i have to die to those opinions i have to die to the fact that i was taught when i was eight to be baptized in father son the holy ghost i had to die to that when i come to the knowledge of the truth and how the word says you are to be baptized i have people coming to me oh jesus said but jesus said that's her famous saying about being baptized but jesus said now father son the holy ghost well if jesus said that then why did peter who just got filled with the holy ghost come and contradict god himself that's right he didn't he just expounded on what jesus said amen he magnified it to help us understand this is what he's saying the answer the father son the holy ghost is the lord jesus christ and that is his name amen and that's how i said and when the lord showed that to me and the lord shows that to you then you've got to die to the other or you you can't just bring that with you you can't just bring in something that's that's tainted by the understanding or the belief that there's three gods that there is a trinity when there's no word even in the bible close to trinity in fact now i don't i don't mean this to be hedonistic but they're actually if you want to study the bible especially the new testament there's actually more scripture to justify two gods than three yeah go study it yourself there's actually more scripture to justify two gods than three but trinity's the way to go what's everybody songs and that's what they're teaching and believing it's a well he hardly ever preaches on it but everything he believes everything he sees and how he views this work is going to be affected by that they hardly ever talk about it doesn't matter if that's their fundamental belief and they haven't died to the understanding there's one god and three per and three offices one god then it's going to be it's going to be affected that way just like every ministering of the true god belief of the godhead is going to be affected that way if you understand and believe and know there's only one god that's how it's going to be revealed to you that's going to that's going to shape your opinion or your view or your revelation of what the bible says then it doesn't become about an understanding it doesn't become about uh can i does this make sense to me it comes about is god revealing himself to me is god opening himself to me is god revealing and showing himself to me are we entering into an intimate relationship or am i still out in the kitchen somewhere have i gone into the bedroom with an intimate relationship with the lord or am i still sitting in the living room drinking a cup of coffee amen am i still outside playing with the dog or have i entered into an intimate relationship has god really opened himself to because god really invited me so that we could come and see all the intimate details who he is amen that's why so many times the scripture jesus said depart i never knew you i never had a relationship with you i i never had intimacy with you but there is a group that comes forth as miss jesus his wife because of that intimate relationship got to be done through the holy spirit he kind of died to everything else now look at this misinterpreting uh genesis chapter 3. we just read this a couple weeks ago now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field remember that subtle sensible his cunning conniving beguiling but it is sensible more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yeah god said ye shall not eat of every uh of every tree of the garden that's his question what's this question loaded with doubt his question is loaded with doubt it's a genuine question anybody should be able to answer any born-again holy ghost-filled godly christians should be able to answer that yes remember eve was not the word she was the byproduct because we're going to get to something a little bit she was the byproduct but the question was to bring doubt so understand he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden questioning the authority of god's word trying to sow doubt and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruits of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest she die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now he's gone from interjecting doubt to false doctrine yes to twisting the word to fit his ends to fit his belief to fit his religion he's twisted the word now so he's taking her from trying to interject doubt to trying to pervert the word the serpent said the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and that is true that is exactly what said and what and what did he bring back same thing that so many people in the same arguments all the time try to do but the bible said uh also says or or or uh but uh but this quote over here refutes this quote over here i'm sorry it does not right it might look like unless brother brandon made a mistake which you listen to the message long enough you find out that uh brother branham made mistakes sometimes calling 1965 1964 and uh i was looking at this yesterday and um uh i i think it was maybe in this message anyway brother madam kept saying over and over when you mess the whole picture of god up you make him one out of three well that makes you sound like that he believes the trinity and putting down the people that are trying to make him one he said it backwards three times he said that right in a row i know he didn't mean to and i know what he meant but each time he said you try to make god one out of three no we're trying to we're making three gods into one not one in the three so you see he got it backwards so he's a man yes you let him be a man then it all works out a lot easier and better see yeah but but those quotes they're not contradictory your opinion or your feeling of them or your interpretation of them might contradict but they don't contradict each other but that's exactly what the serpent is doing here god doesn't know oh i know he said this to you but god does know so what's he doing but he also said this other but god knows but that's not his word he's perverting the word oh god knows that you do this and this and this and now then that's true but that's not what god said that wasn't god's word god said don't do it no question nothing to interpret nothing to to question or misunderstand don't do it that's just it don't do it amen praise the lord she listened to the reasoning of the serpent and she did it she gave it to her husband and he did it you see how that misinterpreting i'd rather random i think he preaches something called the uh several times he calls it the trial or a trial and he talks about how satan comes before eve here and other subjects through the bible and satan misinterpreting the word now eve did not purposely she did not purposely disbelieve god like we said last week week before she didn't purposely disbelieve god satan misinterpreted that word to her he so doubt he brought a new word his word to bring division and that's that's his message that's what he does yes he still does it the same way today yes amen brings division doubt questioning a false word and then a separation from that word oh god said that's why a lot of people say oh but jesus himself said father son the holy ghost but without a rightly dividing of that work which peter had thanks to the whole the new birth that he had just received rightly divided that word and told us what the truth be born in uh be baptized name of jesus christ and then you'll receive the holy ghost yes amen so that's that's rightly that brings that word into into life for us now now look these are the trumpets now someone said well the seven seals then brother brown now this is again i i i picked this because of the man's opinion his opinion without revelation without rightly dividing i thank god brother branham comes and rightly divides it in the as we get into this quote but listen to it i'm giving you this little heads up so you can listen to this as i read through it now someone said well that's seven seals then brother brown that will be revealed in the last day some great mystery of how we get closer to god that's his opinion that's what he thought that's what developed his opinion about those about those seals but then a prophet comes along rightly divides and tells the man no sir it cannot be you cannot add to or take away from the word amen it can be some great thing to get closer to god that's outside this scripture it can't be brother adam says no sir it cannot be whosoever takes one word from this bible or add one's word to it is parts taken to the book of life what it is is a revelation on what has been missed in the back back there to bring now it's already wrote it's already in the scripture it's already here it's to reveal what has already been written because you can't add one thing or take one thing from it it just has to become enlightened revealed to manifest it to those with the holy ghost to see what the word is is bringing to us for our day amen for our day the first chapter of the bible in the beginning genesis one woman she didn't misbelieve it but she just misinterpreted she let satan misinterpret to her one word see and then from that caused all the trouble and that was god was speaking of god's word so that one thing that misinterpreting of that one thing there back then through the entire humanity and the world's picture into a complete chaos different than i believe what it was meant to be when god created adam and the world to begin with right it threw a world into a sin condition which was not god's perfect will right it entered into god's permissive will it is still in god's permissive will that's why if you put a lamb and a lion in the same cage together that light that lamb is not going to last very long right that's why when you go walk through our desert out here now you don't do it without stepping and making sure you don't hit any plants at all because everything here has stickers briar stickers something some of them poke you some stick on you some of them you can't get apples amen you know that is living in the desert it wouldn't be that way if it still wasn't in that curse but it threw everything it was that whole picture changed just because of that one word so that's how it throws that is the example of how it throws the entire word out of continuity if you just miss it off just the skosh amen we can't do it in the chapter of revelation jesus himself the same god said whosoever take one word or add one word to it this is the complete revelation of jesus christ he's patting his bible the seven seals had the mystery hit of what it was and it's supposed to be open or revealed in the last day at the laodicean age now those seals will continue to unfold themselves even after we're gone but they were to be revealed or made known so we could look back to those parts that that were already played out and see the trick of the enemy the ways of the devil the seven seals opening friend was really more than anything to exposing devil in all of his tricks for the first church age up until where we are now and god will continue see people get that seven seal oh well do you believe the seals are open you know it's always a question people are they open you believe they're open well it depends on what your interpretation of open is have they been broken have they been open have they been revealed have they been manifested have they been i mean take your pick yeah what do you what what do you exactly do you mean right i had a brother one time he pinned me down in canada well brother what do you believe he's you know because he'd heard what brother green taught and everything i said well it depends on what you mean and he goes into this that and the other and i said well that's the way i believe this god reveals and opens it up and i said but but i don't believe any seal breaks until it gets to the point that it's supposed to be poured out on the on the world right that's when that seal breaks amen when when god when god allows that seal to happen and break forth onto the people that's when that happens amen not until then you say well that's why people get so many things you go back and breach and uh even some of the seals and uh that that men look at it and they get things so scrupled up because they think that those things happen right then and they weren't happening right then it's just things that brother branham brought out to say this is what happened this is what is happening this is what is going to happen there will be a time saints where there will be no blood on the mercy seat there will be a time that people always push that and say well that's just what brother branham said he even preached sirs could this be the time could it already be over right and that was a sincere question that brother branham had in his heart but we know now he knew then by the time he got to that end of the message if you'll listen to it when he got to the end of it realized that it wasn't but he tried to help people understand we are this close yes we are this close those seven seals had the mysteries here what it was supposed to be in the last days laodicean church age it was just to bring out what has been gone through all this time now let's go to one more scripture in matthew chapter four saint matthew chapter 4 amen matthew saint matthew chapter 4. now as you're turning there we know brother banham preached thinking man's filter which is the word everything has to be filtered through that word everything every part of your life every facet of your life if it doesn't go through this word leave it alone it's got to go through this words gotta pass through this word if you get to a place in life you think i wonder is it okay to smoke put it through the work and see if it is i wonder if it's okay to get a tattoo put it through the word and see if it is yes amen not your filter the word yes that filters got to be filtered with the holy ghost too but see now everything has to be filtered through this word yes but this word is filtered through the holy spirit yes amen the holy spirit that's because it is the word and that's what brings it to the to the revelation understanding revelation of what it's telling us what it's helping us become we see it yes but but more than just seeing it we become it that and that's what matters the most that you become the word now in matthew chapter 4 the amount of temptations we call it matthew 4 1. then then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil now this might seem sort of contradictory to jesus in matthew 6 of jesus model prayer the lord's prayer as we call it a part of that prayer is lead us not into temptation is it not but deliver us from evil but now look at this jesus was led by the spirit the holy spirit into the wilderness for the point or the purpose of being tempted of the devil the holy spirit led jesus into the wilderness for the purpose of being tempted amen but why did he say something different in matthew 6 because this was for him remember he took our place yes so we could take his he went and was led through this temptation one of the greatest if probably not as great as the garden of gethsemane one of the greatest temptations man has ever known after fasting 40 days and 40 nights of the week is part of his human being his spirit his mind must have been in a turmoil anybody ever come close to 40 days and 49 days i haven't even closed but his mind his spirit must have been a complete turmoil as a human as as a flesh body and spirit human spirit must have been in a complete turmoil and the temptation that was come he was purposely led there because he took our place amen now we pray lead us not what we don't need to be led he was he took our place it's like i said a few weeks ago around christmas time you always see people and you hear and i think again uh i heard somebody somewhere in some different country died but they want to they they want to model the crucifixion so close men willing to allow themselves to be nailed to a cross us why would you do that right he did it so we wouldn't have to yes he was led of the spirit to be tempted of the devil so we don't have to yeah amen sure we get tempted there's no doubt we do but the leaning of that temptation is different because the spirit of god led him to that the spirit of god doesn't lead you to temptation the devil will tempt you but this holy spirit doesn't lead you to temptation that's the difference in what jesus did here and what he said in matthew 6 lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil because it's the evil that brings the temptation not a leading if you're being led to temptation you have a wrong spirit right you still have a snake nature in you yes that desires to do that and it's leading you to that understand so he took our place but he was led of the holy ghost of the holy spirit into the wilderness for the purpose of temptation to be tempted thank god he was the bible says he was tempted above all temptation well why did he so he could be my kinsmen yes amen if i got a backache i can go to the lord jesus you know why because there's probably no human ever had a worse backache than he did right if i got a headache you know where i can go i'd go to the lord jesus because there's probably never a human ever lived that had a headache as bad as his when they shoved that crown of thorns down into his skull yes he is tempted above all temptation and he knows what we go through he's our intercessor he's our high priest he's our family position i call him our family physician do people have pcps that's okay he's my pcp praise the lord might have an earthly one too but he's my heavenly one he's my main one he's the one i go to first my primary care physician when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made present does that sound familiar now you got to understand the devil doesn't change his tactics he uses the exact same tactics today he may have used these exact same tactics with you before in the past he may be trying to use that tactic on you right now oh if it is oh if this is the truth oh if you are a child of god oh if and that's that's exactly that's what he did in the garden of eden first thing he tried to do and his deception was to bring doubt right he wants you first to get you to doubt who you are that's what he wants to do the first thing he did that with eve now notice he came to eve who wasn't the word and she fell to that but when he but when he hit this 100 billion volt wire called jesus christ he got his feather sin jesus answered and said it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god but notice the tactic was the same if you are if thou be try to get him to doubt but jesus knew who he was but he was at the weakest point of his human life he was at the weakest point of his human spirit and his life 40 days 40 nights maybe hallucinating i don't know hungry thirsting and the devil tries to get him to doubt who that's the first thing to get you to doubt who you are that's that's the way he can try to get you defeated is that you first have to doubt who you are in christ amen don't let him do it yes don't let him get you to doubt who you are you know who you are in christ in his word and i'll tell you this morning not a lot of us but if you don't know that i would get to know him before you leave here today that's what that's what it's called to be means to be born again you have the holy ghost and you're filled with his spirit there is no doubt when he comes in you know who you are there's any doubt in anybody here i'd make sure i'd that doubt was gone before i leap through that door for that one amen yes sir then the devil fifth first taketh him up into the holy city and setted him on a pinnacle of the temple and he did it again he's still trying to get jesus to doubt who he is and he said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down now what does he do first he tried to get him to doubt and jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god that was his that was his word answer to the error that was presented now satan is doing the same thing if now remember our subject is misinterpreting the word which is exactly what he did to eve which is exactly what he's trying to do to christ but remember christ is the word you can't deceive the word if thou be the son of god cast thyself down listen now for it is written you see what the devil's doing now he's taking the word to try to deceive the word by you can't deceive the word with the word it is the word amen it's like i said last week you can't transgress the word you are the word yes why it's like brother brown said a sinner can't sin that's what he is he's a sinner for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dast thy foot against the stone he's trying to bring the word but he's misinterpreting the word amen first he just tried to get jesus to know who he was jesus corrected that with the word now he's trying to get him to doubt and bring the word into it and say but it is written now don't think for a second satan doesn't know this word he does amen he knows it jesus the word said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god oh yeah it is this is written but it's not interpreted for written for me to purposely say oh i know the grace of god is plentiful so i'll just go live like a devil because god will forgive me it's the same thing it's the same premise yes jesus is saying satan says oh just throw yourself down and his angels will save you jesus said no no no no it says you don't tempt the lord thy god reminds me of those snake handling churches by keys east i said you know what i'm like paul if i get in a place where there's a snake or one bites me or something i believe god will take care of me protect me if i'm out hiking hunting or something god will take care of me and help me and protect me but i'm not going to go into a church of any place or any place for that matter and perfectly say let me grab this poisonous snake and dance around with it oh yeah god will take care of you absolutely but don't you tempt him yes amen don't purposely go in and grab that and just box the snakes and i've told you the stories i've heard back east with some of those churches i don't know if they even exist there probably are some still left but there are i don't know but it i i've heard them before uh i'll tell you this story again now it's true story a man came and he's visiting this church he was a guitar player very good guitar player i could name him you wouldn't know who he is but he was sitting on the platform and he's playing and pre-game service and he was pretty pre-game free service playing and he saw a box next to the pulpit and he looks over at the other guitar player and he's a regular there he says what's in that box over there he said oh those are snakes they'll be opening that box in a little bit and start bringing those snakes out everywhere he'd probably turn white as a sheep but he's he's still playing he says do they have a back door in this place the guy says no they don't he says you reckon they want one he was going to make him the back door he was going to try to get out as fast as he could get out of there but you see you don't tempt the lord yeah so the misinterpretation or misplacement of the word god corrected with the word nothing wrong with the word he said it was the way he said it or or how he misinterpreted it to the word again the word can't be deceived by the word now last one and again again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things will i give thee if that will fall down and worship me now he's not trying to deceive him he's not trying to get him to doubt who he is he's no longer trying to bring the word against him he's not trying to deceive him he's just trying to use the humanity that every one of us possess of greed and pride right to take over which happens more and more every day in this world anyway to people in that pride and then that greed to do things they're not supposed to do to do things they shouldn't do to do things that any christian shouldn't do because of the pride arrogance the greed so he's he's he's working on the weakness and the humanity of jesus and his flesh at that time and offering him the entire world and he could do it because at that time he still possessed it satan still possessed this world he's still in the possession he still possesses it but he possessed it at this time in a way that he could relinquish his possession to another he can't do that now he's just a squatter now he's still in control of it but he's just a squatter because when jesus died and the chemical chemistry of the blood fell into the earth it was redeemed back to god yes that blood the chemistry of the blood redeemed this ball of dirt back to god it was his possession it is in his possession again belongs to him so satan could at one point give it to him but after that blood was shared yet he could no longer do it right but he tried to give it to him and he could have done it if you will fall down and worship me then then saith jesus unto him get thee hints satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered to him notice the one thing that defeated the devil every single time was the word the word in the hands of a believer will win every time yes amen amen pure unadulterated not misplaced not mislocated not displaced the pure word of god in the hands of a believer today will work every single time it will defeat the enemy every single time yes now did jesus have the power to say satan i curse you into a frog that devil would have riveted off that mountain yes sure he could have no i cursed you as men he would have never spoke another word good i curse you into the dust of the ground he'll walk right over him as he left that place but he didn't do that right he taught us a lesson because remember he went there in our place amen he went there in our place he was led of the holy ghost to be tempted of the devil he took our place so we could be not led to tempted he's there taking our place so this whole scenario that is played out here before us now i don't know about you friend but when entering into that spirit of that story i can see it right now it's like i feel like i'm there i don't know about you but i i feel like i'm here i can see this taking place but it is for us to gain that understanding and that faith to realize satan doesn't need to be cursed into dust or to a frog or there's a mute we just use the word yes you just use what is in you you are the word use that word to combat the enemy and it will win every time jesus said this the word says this and you use that word the word it will always work it will never fail now in the hands of an unbeliever or the hands of somebody not born again in the hands of somebody that's misinterpreted or something oh yeah that doesn't work but in the hands of a born-again believer by faith that word works every time yes he's standing in our place as an example to us of how we defeat this enemy today yes with the word first don't ever get him to let you doubt who you are in christ however that's just the wedge in the door that satan needs to try to bring deception don't let him do it don't let him bring that wedge in there saying don't ever let him get to believe get you to believe or doubt who you are in christ amen and then you stand on that word you stand take that tie post and you give it back to him and let him see no you are the life behind the name yes amen that word let me read this one more scripture i'll close here back in second timothy chapter four i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ again look i just dawned on me i i picked this scripture yesterday but it just dawned on me what i'd said earlier had no intention of saying what i said earlier but look at this i charged you before god and the lord jesus christ how many is that i mean if you were to look at it with a carnal understanding that's two not three just like i was saying before anyway we'll move on from that i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ someone without obviously revelation or understanding who shall judge the quick and the quick and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine now that's preaching but we're all ministers we know that kings and priests yes amen we don't all get up here amen we know that that's a five-fold ministry but we're all ministers so the bible specifically is speaking to all of us preach the word the instant nc's not obscene reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts their own opinions their own feelings thoughts they shall heed to themselves teachers having itching ears greedy prideful amen just wanting of just wanting some stature wanting a position wanting money whatever it is and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables now that's an introduction of hebrews 11 24 that we just went over last week it shall turn from the truth unto fable no more sacrifice for sin but it's very serious never to misinterpret the word amen now next week lord willing uh i want to try to bring it together because all these really do go together the dislocate the misplace probably go together more than the misinterpret but it all dovetails together in fact some things i've said today you will hear again next week just because of that fact but it's so important to keep that puzzle that picture perfect right uh the apples in the tree and the cow picking eating on the ground had the picture right to build the car right to put the pulpit together for it all to fit just perfectly right together it has to stay the way it said that god brought it amen holy ghost in our lives rightly divide that word to our hearts now there are sometimes just like even through the church ages it wasn't meant for luther to preach what brother branham preached it wasn't his lock to open or for the seals to be opened while he was here it wasn't he dabbled in it here and there wesley did but it wasn't for that see and sometimes that that is with us remember i i've told this quote before i'm closing here brother branham said that god will let you know as you have need of knowing it and maybe there's still things that you don't quite i'll just use the word understand even though that's not the proper word i like to use people normally use that word but i don't like to use it because it's not an understanding it's god opening itself revealing but there may be some of those i told you myself i still have things i know it's on the shelf i just you know i'm just waiting on the lord to bring this together and to dove tell it where it's where it belongs i i don't i don't want to take dove feathers and shove them in a crow and try to say he's a dog i i you know and that's exactly what people try to do with the word to try to prove their some great revelation somebody they'll take feathers out of a dub and shove them in a crow and say there he said dove no he's not you've hydrated or crossed that well you haven't hybrided you just become a fake he's a crow with a couple of dove feathers stuck in him but take it as god reveals it it'll be in its proper place it'll be put in its proper position and then it'll all continue on just perfect dovetailed exactly the way god wrote it and exactly the way he reveals it to us perfect amen that's our anchor that's our type praise the lord let's stand if we could praise the lord amen what a wonderful god he is too yes thank you jesus thy word david said is a lamp unto my feet alighted to my path and that word continues to illuminate our paths every day we walk through life as we go through life as god blesses us speaks to us even as we just just go on our daily lives amen we just go on our daily lives it's a it's a lamp to our feet light into our path how many times you've gone through life or you've gone a certain place and you're really not even thinking about the lord really you know you're just living your life you're going about and all of a sudden something happens or something comes up or whatever and the word hits you just like that you ever had that that happens to me a lot the word comes around you think god is present even i'm walking around i wasn't even thinking about him i just honestly you know every second and then something happens and there it is thank god you are with
