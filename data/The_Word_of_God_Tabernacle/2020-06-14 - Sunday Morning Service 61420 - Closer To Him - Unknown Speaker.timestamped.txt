[10:57] blessing us and being with us watching
[10:59] over keeping us healthy and strong and
[11:02] being able to have another beautiful
[11:03] Sunday service for his glory and honor
[11:06] we have a couple of prayer requests want
[11:08] to make known to you today want to
[11:10] continue to remember the fra house in
[11:12] prayer they're still quarantined as you
[11:15] know maybe remember the sister for
[11:18] Chile's sister Priscilla's sister tested
[11:21] positive positive for coronavirus and
[11:24] her subsequent family members are
[11:26] starting to get ill in that not going to
[11:29] the hospital I kind of recommended maybe
[11:32] they go the one of them is having a hard
[11:35] time breathing and I recommend it maybe
[11:37] going and getting on a ventilator but
[11:38] they said so many people died on the
[11:40] ventilators well reason people are dying
[11:42] on ventilators is because the only
[11:44] reason they put them on a ventilator is
[11:45] when there are really bad condition
[11:47] right so when you're in really bad
[11:50] condition they put you on a ventilator
[11:51] so the worst people in the worst cases
[11:55] are dying on ventilators well that's why
[11:57] they're dying on ventilators not because
[11:58] there's something wrong with ventilators
[12:00] but anyway we want to remember her
[12:03] family of course angel and the kids so
[12:07] remember them this will be in their
[12:09] second week of their quarantine and just
[12:11] I believe the Lord's protective gonna be
[12:13] with them so but pray for them and the
[12:15] fam
[12:15] we'll also got text from sister Celia
[12:19] earlier today to remember her continued
[12:22] remember her brother Harlan he's got a
[12:23] big day coming up in the June 26th which
[12:27] I guess is - about two weeks from now
[12:30] ish so we don't give too much detail but
[12:35] just again sister Celia wants you to
[12:37] remember her brother Harlan in prayer
[12:39] he's still in Texas still going through
[12:43] what he's going through there with this
[12:44] home and his wife so please remember him
[12:47] in prayer also to remember sister sure
[12:52] aya and brother art still having car
[12:55] troubles it's in the shop and the shops
[12:58] having a hard time keeping it from
[12:59] overheating so but I guess in this heat
[13:03] is kind of hard to keep anything from
[13:05] over here but her heart's supposed to so
[13:08] let's just remember them people get
[13:10] overheated guys a lot of times burning
[13:12] cars but let's just remember them and
[13:14] prayer the Lord would just help them
[13:15] guide the mechanic however to fix your
[13:18] car two words in a place of repair that
[13:21] they can have a car and do things and
[13:23] come out Church in also please remember
[13:25] them in prayer anyone else have a spoken
[13:29] request real quick I know we're trying
[13:31] to change it that's kind of one of the
[13:32] reasons I wanted to do the song service
[13:35] again today these are members would get
[13:38] back into the into the
[13:44] the routine I hate using that word
[13:46] especially when it comes to church but
[13:48] when you get the routine of coming in
[13:51] and writing down the prayer requests and
[13:53] praise report so I want to have I
[13:56] noticed we didn't have set out but I
[13:58] want to set out one that has four
[14:02] praise reports too so we got the prayer
[14:04] requests but remember also the praise
[14:07] reports we want to put down so we want
[14:08] to have those so we don't call every
[14:11] service we just have it written down and
[14:15] read it to you move forward so if you
[14:17] remember that is again we get into the
[14:19] routine of being together again remember
[14:21] that write the prayer requests in that
[14:23] down and if it's a praise report for now
[14:25] it's okay if you want to put it on a
[14:26] price on a prayer request sheet that's
[14:29] fine just we'll just put it on there and
[14:31] just read it to you so that we have that
[14:34] so we do have one written for brother
[14:39] Pat I just glanced at it brother Pat for
[14:41] a moment it lists sort of like more of a

[19:05] [Music]
[20:11] Oh
[20:39] [Music]
[20:52] [Applause]
[20:52] [Music]
[20:54] [Applause]
[20:57] [Music]
[21:53] [Music]
[23:06] [Music]
[23:36] you know present
[23:40] you know his hand is with us amen I'm so
[23:44] thankful he's one that we can always
[23:47] depend upon you know I was talking to
[23:49] him a little bit this morning and you
[23:52] know what King Jimmy is as I was talking
[23:54] to him I vomited he's always been that
[23:57] close friend and I thought about making
[24:00] Lord willing maybe a little following
[24:02] for a midweek but just give you a little
[24:05] snippet I just started thinking about
[24:06] you know much as I love my wife and as
[24:09] much as I'm whether there's times of my
[24:12] life she's not with me my parents aren't
[24:15] with me anymore
[24:16] I was with them for many many years but
[24:18] I wasn't always with them and they're
[24:20] not here anymore I'm not always with my
[24:23] children I'm always with my
[24:24] grandchildren I'm always with my church
[24:25] family friends but you know there's one
[24:29] that's always there
[24:30] amen that's him praise the Lord thankful
[24:34] he is always there and it reminded me
[24:38] too and maybe should have mentioned as a
[24:41] prayer request but you know there's some
[24:43] fires going up in the hills you know
[24:45] this time last Sunday I didn't think a
[24:47] whole lot about it because lightning
[24:49] strike I think was Friday but you know I
[24:52] just just push rich not all the fuel up
[24:54] there for fires and wildfires but that
[24:57] thing has gotten pretty bad so just
[25:00] remember that Lord just protect the
[25:02] people and keep everyone safe and watch
[25:06] over them just especially the
[25:07] firefighters who brave the flames and
[25:11] the heed and you know I watch those guys
[25:14] those people may be women - I don't know
[25:17] but they put on that gear that's real
[25:19] heavy and thick and those tanks and the
[25:21] weight and the heat it's 106 and it
[25:25] can't be easy
[25:27] so just remember them in prayer if you
[25:30] would - and we're just thankful that
[25:31] there's those that are willing to do
[25:34] that and to be there and to fight those
[25:36] fires and the tankers and helicopters
[25:39] and so but the Lord protects us and
[25:42] keeps us in his hands amen you know that
[25:45] bolt of lightning could have hit right
[25:47] outside any one of our houses and
[25:49] started that fire and come our way and
[25:51] you know brother the patents are on that
[25:56] sparsely populated area out there with
[25:59] acreage and a lot of a lot of vegetation
[26:01] but God protects amen watches over each
[26:04] one of us so we're very thankful for
[26:06] that
[26:06] amen he's a wonderful living God isn't
[26:09] he so thankful God to give us that time
[26:11] so amen god bless you today and then
[26:16] we'll go to the Word of God and do you
[26:19] want to have a special song
[26:37] people to encourage people to encourage
[26:40] your friends and so forth especially
[26:42] with this spire and so forth that when
[26:44] the scientists were traveling the DNA
[26:47] they discovered that all the entire
[26:50] Hebrew alphabet is encoded in the DNA
[26:53] and one woman her remark to her because
[26:57] her husband was good friends with these
[26:59] scientists she heard mark was well
[27:02] that's easy because now they're finding
[27:11] messages Raisa Laurens can deny that

[27:23] image his reflection amen body spirit

[29:45] don't know whether he's a boy or girl
[29:46] check his chromosomes that'll tell you I
[29:50] was just so sad I I am NOT a fan of the
[29:55] Harry Potter and all that garbage but or
[29:59] the or the author but it strains it she
[30:04] I've read this week I just say this and
[30:06] we'll go to the word but I just read
[30:08] this week that she is under fire now she
[30:11] is actually being ridiculed
[30:13] because she had the audacity to come out
[30:16] and say there is a difference upon birth
[30:19] of a male and a female she's under fire
[30:23] for saying that she is in trouble she's
[30:27] being ridiculed because she actually
[30:29] said there's a difference between a boy
[30:32] a girl a male and a female hope it but
[30:35] anyway that's our society right praise
[30:38] the Lord but I meant but I am thankful
[30:40] God's not dead he's still alive praise
[30:43] the Lord Jesus amen if you stand with me
[30:46] turn in your Bibles now to Roman's we'll
[30:48] go to the eighth chapter really a simple
[30:52] thought this after this morning
[30:55] saying this morning afternoon this
[30:57] morning kind of a simple thought
[31:00] actually this this again there were two
[31:05] messages that came on a Sunday that I
[31:08] kind of resonated their thought was
[31:09] gonna originate a midweek and the Lord
[31:13] changed it this in our streaming said
[31:16] now this is the same thing this I was
[31:19] gonna do this last week as a midweek and
[31:22] I went twice I even started to set my
[31:25] camera for my desk twice to do this and
[31:28] something happened each time it stopped
[31:30] me and then the other day I just felt
[31:33] compelled the Lord that to make this for
[31:35] today so I'm just trust in the Lord has
[31:39] a reason for that right he been so
[31:41] Romans 8 we'll start with verse 26
[31:45] Romans chapter 8 start with verse 26 but
[31:49] let's bow our head to get forward of
[31:50] prayer pretty good precious Jesus father
[31:55] again would come to you thanking you for
[31:58] all the grace and mercy you give us your
[32:00] love and help and health and strength
[32:02] and life and Lord your loving blessings
[32:05] to us Lord is nothing we deserve this
[32:07] nothing we earned it's it's nothing Lord
[32:10] that we can attain to of our own
[32:12] abilities but we're thankful God that
[32:14] you and your unmerited favor give it to
[32:16] us Lord not because we loved you but
[32:19] because you loved us and your love is
[32:21] unconditional God there is nothing that
[32:24] it is based upon other than the fact
[32:26] that you chose to and we thank you today
[32:29] God we want to return to you after we've
[32:32] come to the recognition and
[32:34] acknowledgement Lord of that love that
[32:35] you have toward us now and this service
[32:38] today return to that just a little
[32:40] portion to you God in our hearts and let
[32:43] you know
[32:43] Lord how much we love you today I
[32:46] believe that love that we have for you
[32:48] God is unconditional and compelled us to
[32:50] be in the house of God in this service
[32:53] again today God we're thankful father
[32:55] that you're with us you never leave us
[32:57] or forsake us your grace and mercy Lord
[33:00] is more bountiful than we could ever
[33:02] even begin to use but God we know that
[33:05] you're there with us and we want
[33:06] be careful to give you the praise and
[33:08] thanks to the glory for Lord you are the
[33:11] only one there that is there for us
[33:13] continually we're leading on you Lord
[33:15] and we're trusting in you believing
[33:17] father you again to speak through these
[33:19] lips anoint the hearers and Lord may you
[33:22] just anointing may your Holy Spirit fall
[33:25] upon the rest of this service as we
[33:26] commit it to you now in the name of the
[33:29] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[33:32] Romans 8:26 only 26 to 28 inclusive
[33:37] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[33:40] infirmities for we know not what we
[33:42] should pray for as we ought but the
[33:45] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[33:48] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[33:49] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[33:52] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[33:54] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[33:56] according to the will of God and we know
[33:59] that all things work together for good
[34:01] to them that are that love God to them
[34:06] who are the called according to his
[34:08] purpose
[34:08] you can be seen it if you'd like and a
[34:12] lot of times we take and I just want to
[34:15] title this today if you will closer to
[34:17] him closer to him as you could probably
[34:20] see the title of that would be a nice
[34:22] midweek but again I feel like the Lord
[34:26] stretched it up to bring it today thus
[34:28] as a result we ended up not now having a
[34:32] midweek again which my apologies for but
[34:34] I don't know it's me or what I just
[34:37] couldn't find a mind of the Lord or
[34:38] something to bring to you for a midweek
[34:40] so I apologize I can always go in the
[34:42] scripture and read something in that but
[34:44] I don't I don't ever want to do that I
[34:47] can but I prefer is the leading of the
[34:50] Lord I prefer the Lord give me something
[34:52] that's going to be food for your soul is
[34:54] going to be something that's
[34:54] encouragement something that's fresh
[34:56] that God is giving an anointing and I'm
[35:00] bringing to you each one of us likewise
[35:02] so but I want you now just to keep that
[35:05] in mind closer to him now that's where
[35:07] this came from
[35:08] because of everything that's going on
[35:10] sure all that's being pressed upon
[35:12] people today but I want to draw onto
[35:15] this of course I'm gonna major really on
[35:17] the 28th first but I want to draw the
[35:18] comparison or the completion of this
[35:22] script your beginning in the 26th verse
[35:24] that really goes from the first verse
[35:26] but just for sake of time if you'd like
[35:28] to go back and read the entire chapter
[35:30] of chapter 8 of Romans but back in the
[35:33] 26th verse and look and see what what is
[35:37] being taught to us what what Paul is
[35:40] trying to explain to us Orie she's doing
[35:42] the Romans the Roman Church to us today
[35:45] so that we can garner from this what the
[35:48] Holy Spirit is teaching us for today
[35:50] likewise look now likewise the spirit
[35:53] now that's the Holy Spirit of course
[35:56] also help with our infirmities and
[35:59] that's our inabilities our shortcomings
[36:02] in that the Holy Spirit is there to help
[36:06] those shortcomings for for each of our
[36:09] lives each of our lives we live daily we
[36:14] can all probably confess to the fact
[36:16] that for lack of better verbage there's
[36:20] gaps in our lives not that we fall
[36:23] asleep or not that we get knocked
[36:25] unconscious or not that but there's just
[36:27] gaps there's just places where you know
[36:31] the Spirit comes to make intercession to
[36:34] fill that gap to fill that void to fill
[36:38] that empty place if you will and I'm
[36:42] sure we all can understand and attain
[36:45] the fact that we've had those empty
[36:46] places we've had those void spots on our
[36:49] lives but the Bible says that the Spirit
[36:51] help with our infirmities
[36:55] which is Vail at filling in those
[36:57] shortcomings those places where we fall
[37:00] short God fills in for us
[37:03] amen is like coming up coming down a
[37:06] road and coming to a bridge well if
[37:09] there's no bridge there you can't go any
[37:11] further you have to go down in the river
[37:13] or whatever but that but and there's
[37:16] those gaps and the Holy Spirit's the
[37:18] same way life is that way
[37:20] we know that
[37:21] turns and there's heels and there's
[37:22] curves and there's smooth places and
[37:25] there's left places and there's harder
[37:27] places but it's just like that road when
[37:29] you go on across the road of life
[37:31] there's a lot of times there's those
[37:33] gaps those missing spots now a lot of
[37:37] people when they find those missing
[37:39] spots are those infirmities and they get
[37:41] into those empty places many times
[37:43] people go to the liquor cabinet or
[37:45] they'll go to the drug cabinet or though
[37:47] the medicine cabinet to get drugs or or
[37:50] they'll try to fill it with riotous
[37:52] living or gambling or something like
[37:54] that everybody tries to and has to fill
[37:56] in that gap see and and in filling in
[37:59] that gap we all have the ability to to
[38:05] take that gap and fill it with the Lord
[38:07] because with Jesus because that's what
[38:09] the purpose of that gap is for God wants
[38:12] everybody to to surrender their lives to
[38:16] him to make him number one of their
[38:19] lives and to be born again and God puts
[38:23] that in every inherent in every human so
[38:26] when that road when that road of light
[38:28] comes to that gap the Holy Spirit those
[38:32] who have the Holy Spirit makes a bridge
[38:35] or helps it says that in Furman see that
[38:37] shortcoming God bridges that God God
[38:41] puts a bridge up there so when you keep
[38:43] going you don't have to reach to the
[38:45] medicine you don't have to reach the the
[38:47] the drug excuse me or the alcohol or
[38:50] something like that some people release
[38:52] it by gambling and doing other things
[38:55] you don't have to fill that gap because
[38:57] God is there the Holy Spirit is there to
[38:59] fill that gap so when that gap comes to
[39:01] that little empty place in your life and
[39:04] I want to make this a focal point of
[39:06] this service is it God fills that gap in
[39:09] so that you can just keep riding the
[39:11] waves cresting over every road every mob
[39:13] every bump every Hill every dip God is
[39:17] that Holy Spirit is there to feel that
[39:18] he helps those infirmities he's there to
[39:22] be there in those shortcomings those
[39:24] those times were we fall short and the
[39:27] times even a question the times that
[39:30] were just not sure the times
[39:33] feel like maybe we're searching for
[39:35] something well you know that God put
[39:37] that inherent in you to search for him
[39:39] God wants you to search for him that's
[39:42] why it's there so that the Holy Spirit
[39:44] is is there to level that place out it
[39:47] helps that it helps fill that gap it
[39:51] helped bridge that infirmity amen so we
[39:55] all have them every human has them it's
[39:58] just which way are we gonna reach to are
[40:01] we gonna reach to God amen cuz during
[40:04] this day and hour and this is where I
[40:06] got the thought during this day and hour
[40:08] especially now the riots and the looting
[40:12] and the protip Amin Fred you said all
[40:16] it's the end time they've been doing
[40:17] that for hundreds of years that's
[40:19] nothing new I mean it's pretty I hate to
[40:23] see it it's a bad situation but that's
[40:26] been going on for years that's not
[40:27] something that's unusual and new that
[40:31] that type of things been going on for
[40:33] years tens of years decades hundreds of
[40:37] years even people get in the streets
[40:38] protest I mean the French Revolution was
[40:42] all about people protesting to take over
[40:44] the country and take over the government
[40:46] so it's always been there so you don't
[40:49] don't look at that but the thought that
[40:51] came to me was we're all in the middle
[40:55] of this and there's so many things going
[40:57] on in in so many lives and and there's
[41:00] people out there that don't have jobs
[41:01] yet there's people out there that are
[41:03] trying to make ends meet there's people
[41:05] out there that we're living paycheck to
[41:07] paycheck and all of a sudden in one
[41:09] 24-hour period BAM there was it ended it
[41:13] stopped they had no more checks they had
[41:16] no more income they had no more way to
[41:18] pay bills rent feed their children and
[41:20] all this just stopped so the pressure is
[41:26] felt you know a few weeks ago I preached
[41:28] on pressure the pressure is felt the
[41:30] pressure is felt by everybody but the
[41:33] pressure is there to not only just
[41:36] pressurize us as I talked about on that
[41:38] sermon that that pressure is there to
[41:41] it's going to do one of two things
[41:43] the pressure is either
[41:45] to draw you closer to you or it's going
[41:48] to pull you further away from him and
[41:50] that's the point of it the point of it
[41:53] is it's separating it's bringing the
[41:56] body line between those that really
[41:58] believe and are born again and filled
[42:01] with the Holy Spirit of those who aren't
[42:02] and that dividing line is becoming
[42:05] broader and broader because the gap the
[42:07] Holy Spirit is filling in the gaps that
[42:09] the helping those infirmities of those
[42:12] that have that but if you don't those
[42:15] are the places were people and sometimes
[42:18] may have thought they had the Holy Ghost
[42:20] and really didn't people who thought
[42:22] they were a Christian and really weren't
[42:24] people who thought they were going to a
[42:26] good church or listening to the Word of
[42:27] God er that they all thought that they
[42:29] were in this great position but then
[42:31] when the pressure came in the and the
[42:33] hardships come down then where do they
[42:36] go because they're going to go one of
[42:38] two places they're gonna go away from
[42:41] God further from God or they're going to
[42:43] get closer to God and God wants us to
[42:47] take these times and become closer to
[42:50] him amen
[42:52] closer to him maybe wonder why did God
[42:55] even in some places shut us up in homes
[42:59] for days and weeks on in instead of
[43:03] having so much other things going on in
[43:05] life in so many other places to go and
[43:07] so much else to do God's shutting us up
[43:09] in our homes
[43:11] what are we used in that time for to
[43:14] come closer to young guess what God
[43:17] wants us to do that's the whole point
[43:19] God makes it therefore is if we draw
[43:21] closer to him every bit of what is
[43:24] happening to bring us to that point now
[43:26] some more voluntarily get closer to the
[43:30] Lord it's more of a desire it's more of
[43:32] an unction is more of a pull in some
[43:33] people it's just like children you know
[43:36] when you raise children all most of us
[43:38] in here have and some of us may yet
[43:40] still do that but most of us have when
[43:43] you raise children you know I've heard
[43:45] the saying I've said it others have said
[43:47] some come easy and some come hard some
[43:51] children learn easy and some children
[43:54] learn hard some children you say okay
[43:57] don't do this because you're gonna fall
[43:58] and hurt yourself some children are like
[44:01] oh okay well Danny says I better I
[44:03] better not do that because I don't I
[44:05] don't wanna I don't want to break my arm
[44:06] so I'm not gonna do it and they don't do
[44:08] it and some kids no matter what you say
[44:11] they're gonna do it they're gonna wait
[44:14] to you're not there you're not looking
[44:16] or they distracted you somehow and
[44:18] they're gonna do whatever that is you
[44:20] told her not to do now they're most the
[44:22] time they're gonna fall and do exactly
[44:24] what you said and what's gonna happen to
[44:25] that child is gonna be exactly what you
[44:27] told him what happened and you would
[44:29] think that would be enough but it isn't
[44:31] always enough the next time you say okay
[44:33] now don't do this I told you over here
[44:35] what what happened
[44:37] just exactly what you told me daddy
[44:39] wasn't I'm telling you the same things
[44:40] gonna happen you're gonna get in that
[44:42] one child that one that comes hard
[44:45] they're gonna do it every time but but
[44:49] it but some come and they they come easy
[44:51] like okay you know Maya I will confess
[44:56] to you even be from the south I was not
[45:00] spanked very often in my life and my
[45:02] sister got so mad at me she called me a
[45:05] spoiled rotten brat and everything else
[45:07] and I probably was what was the youngest
[45:09] youngest usually as poor Brad but anyway
[45:11] I Owen denied that necessarily but but I
[45:14] asked my dad I actually asked my dad one
[45:17] time because she kept saying going on
[45:19] about I asked to ask my dad one time I
[45:21] said why did you not and he said whoa
[45:25] son I didn't have to he said you might
[45:29] have done something once he said
[45:32] sometimes I would tell you and you just
[45:34] wouldn't do it
[45:35] and sometimes you would do it and I
[45:37] would tell you not to do it again you
[45:39] wouldn't do it again so there was no
[45:42] need to spank you to teach you a lesson
[45:44] or to show you that you're not you
[45:47] you're too old baby had not dude the
[45:49] things I tell you not to do and you
[45:51] learn you were an easy learner so I
[45:54] didn't have to spank you as much so as
[45:57] well that was his testimony I don't know
[46:01] I sure didn't feel that way I thought it
[46:02] was pretty bad kid but this was what he
[46:04] told me and some come easy some come
[46:07] hard you know and this is
[46:09] anything with the children of God some
[46:10] are easy some are hard some some are
[46:13] gonna come the hard way some look at it
[46:15] and they draw closer to the Lord and
[46:17] some look at it and you know God's got
[46:19] to give him a little more of a nudge
[46:21] he's got to give him a little more of a
[46:22] just an unction and some people he's
[46:25] just got a flat-out shove then he does
[46:29] and it's a little harder when he shoves
[46:32] it's a lot harder than if you just come
[46:34] on your own but even when he shoves you
[46:37] the end result is the whole point the
[46:40] one that comes on his own becomes closer
[46:42] to God the one that has to get nudged
[46:44] becomes closer to God the one that is
[46:47] shoved into a whiplash becomes closer so
[46:51] the whole point is regardless of whether
[46:53] it's easy come or hard aids the end
[46:56] results the same see and that's the
[46:58] whole point that God wants us to become
[47:01] closer to him and everything we do and
[47:04] everything of what God's saying it won't
[47:06] be wants us to be closer to him a lot of
[47:09] people take things and they think well
[47:11] this is this is too hard this is too
[47:13] rough this is this is a I don't
[47:17] understand why God would do that you
[47:20] know and and then people leave because
[47:22] they just don't how could a God do this
[47:25] why he just wants to bring you closer to
[47:27] him and he figured out a way or he
[47:30] didn't figured out he knew but there is
[47:32] a way that to bring you to that place if
[47:36] you're gonna come to that place and so
[47:40] the pressure comes to say well are we
[47:41] gonna come this way we're gonna come
[47:44] closer to God or are we just gonna
[47:47] forget God and go away so that that gap
[47:51] is there for a purpose that's my reason
[47:54] for saying all that I get that gap is
[47:56] there for a purpose that infirmity is
[48:00] there for a purpose we all have them
[48:02] different ways and shortcomings we all
[48:04] have this Showboat shortcomings the Holy
[48:08] Spirit is there to help us with those
[48:10] shortcomings just like other people
[48:12] again they just drink their self into
[48:15] oblivion
[48:15] see they they try to overcome that gap
[48:18] by not remembering it or being so out of
[48:22] their minds that they don't feel
[48:24] anything right they numb their senses so
[48:27] much that that there's no feeling about
[48:30] what's going on and they hope that by
[48:32] the time they come out of that and they
[48:35] take their head out of the toilet that
[48:37] they're gonna be better off rarely ever
[48:41] happens from I know of what I know of
[48:43] it's probably worse but but that's the
[48:46] whole point of trying to numb themselves
[48:48] to get past that let's see when you have
[48:50] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost helps you
[48:52] through that the Holy Ghost helps level
[48:54] that place the Holy Ghost helps bridge
[48:56] that gap so he takes care of it for us
[48:59] now let's that's the first part of the
[49:03] verse list for we know for we know not
[49:07] excuse me for we know not what we should
[49:09] pray for as we ought but the Spirit
[49:13] itself maketh intercession for us with
[49:17] groanings which cannot be uttered
[49:19] so that spirit is making those
[49:22] intercession on our behalf
[49:24] as we pray as we speak to the Lord as
[49:27] our relationship with the Lord is
[49:29] enhanced we don't know necessarily or
[49:33] understand necessarily yes we have
[49:36] things that are written down yes we have
[49:37] things in our minds and friends and
[49:39] family people we know that need prayer
[49:41] and things saying we let those people up
[49:43] those are more supplications really the
[49:45] prayer supplication is when you
[49:48] supplicate before the Lord and you talk
[49:50] to them about the infirmities and the
[49:52] needs and the people and things like
[49:53] that but when we just speak to the Lord
[49:56] we just pray to the Lord we don't know
[49:58] necessarily how to pray but the Holy
[50:01] Spirit does amen now look because that
[50:05] spirit is making the intercession on our
[50:08] behalf because that because that blood
[50:11] is still there
[50:12] amen remember we talked about that that
[50:14] the mercy seat there will be something
[50:16] that will try to convince you that it's
[50:17] not there anymore I differ with that I
[50:20] believe it is still there because it is
[50:22] still making intercession because the
[50:24] inner
[50:25] of even the bride is necessary for today
[50:28] brother Branham said if that blood was
[50:31] not there your prayer could not get
[50:33] through to God that's pretty simple to
[50:37] me that making intercession with
[50:40] groanings which cannot be uttered or
[50:42] understood if you will or understood
[50:45] sometimes you know we talk about the
[50:48] speaking in tongues of men and angels
[50:49] and that kind of thing but it's just an
[50:52] intercession that the Lord does on our
[50:53] behalf the Lord speaks through you the
[50:56] Lord helps us to understand those things
[50:59] that are the purpose that God has in our
[51:02] lives and he that searches the hearts
[51:06] that's God of course
[51:07] knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit
[51:10] the mind of the Spirit now it's
[51:12] transcending my desires my wants it's
[51:19] going beyond what I want to happen and
[51:21] it's reaching to a level of as a
[51:24] Christian living my life for him not for
[51:29] me my life is lived for the Lord Jesus
[51:32] has for many many years now there's a
[51:36] lot of flaws and a lot of gaps and a lot
[51:39] of infirmities in there shortcomings but
[51:44] I've tried my best to live my life for
[51:48] him it's not my life it's his life now
[51:50] thankfully and I appreciate the Lord
[51:53] allowing me to be able to spend time and
[51:55] health and strength to go to work and
[51:57] earn income and make a living and
[51:59] provide for my family and things like
[52:01] that the Lord allows those things in our
[52:03] life that we can do that but we do that
[52:06] on his behalf we do that for him we do
[52:09] it as unto the Lord even though it may
[52:12] not be going to the hospital and praying
[52:14] for the sick or attending someone or
[52:16] having Church or something or
[52:17] ministering or it doesn't have to be
[52:20] that it's just being unto the Lord and
[52:23] for anything and everything you do and
[52:25] that's what the minds of the Spirit
[52:27] it is it's getting us into the place of
[52:30] God's perfect will so it's not my will
[52:34] anymore it's not my life it's his life
[52:37] it's his life so let me finish this up
[52:39] in the mind of the Spirit because he
[52:42] maketh intercession for the Saints
[52:44] according to the will of God now notice
[52:48] that he doesn't make intercession
[52:51] according to what your wants are he
[52:54] doesn't make intercession based on what
[52:56] now I do know the Bible says if we
[52:58] delight ourselves in the Lord he'll give
[52:59] us the desires of my heart that's the
[53:01] scripture I believe that that's the
[53:04] truth but Lautrec
[53:06] we're not here to appease ourselves the
[53:10] Spirit doesn't make intercession for us
[53:13] on to mention our desires or to match
[53:18] our wants or to just drop a million
[53:22] dollars in your lap or a Bentley in the
[53:24] parking lot or a house in the foothills
[53:26] that's not the point and God bless you
[53:29] with that then well praise the Lord I
[53:31] mean if God allows you to have money
[53:34] then there's nothing wrong with that you
[53:37] know I just started harder for a rich
[53:39] man to get through into the kingdom of
[53:41] heaven than a camel through that veneto
[53:43] but anyway there's this fine doesn't say
[53:47] it couldn't do it just more complicated
[53:49] so if God did that to you and give it to
[53:52] you for a reason for a purpose and it's
[53:54] not for your glorification it's not for
[53:56] your self edification it's not for you
[53:59] to be exalted it's not for you to be
[54:01] looked upon as something wonderful or
[54:03] greater some statue or something it's
[54:07] for God the intercession listen the
[54:11] intercession that the spirit makes on
[54:14] our behalf is according to his will not
[54:18] my will now if that intercession has to
[54:24] fight against something that I'm trying
[54:26] to accomplish or do selfishly rules
[54:29] if I'm doing it because it's something
[54:32] that that is a selfish desire
[54:35] self-esteem or maybe even contrary to
[54:38] the will of God that intercession is
[54:40] making that change it's going to
[54:44] manipulate that to work it becomes into
[54:46] God's perfect will and God's perfect
[54:50] will in our lives you've heard me say it
[54:52] and I still believe and I'll say it
[54:54] again in my opinion God permissive will
[54:57] is failure I don't ever want to be in
[55:00] God's permissive will I always want to
[55:02] be in His perfect wheel
[55:04] thank God further permissive wheel
[55:06] because I found myself there more often
[55:08] than I'd like to be and I'm thankful it
[55:10] exists and brings us to the place that
[55:12] we do end up in His perfect wheel but I
[55:15] still don't want to ever go there I
[55:17] still want to stay in God's perfect well
[55:19] why don't we do that the intercession of
[55:21] the Spirit is according to the will of
[55:24] God so if we just follow that
[55:26] intercession of the of that remember II
[55:28] say we don't we don't know 26 mercy we
[55:32] don't know we know not what we should
[55:37] pray for we up as for we up but the
[55:40] Spirit making intercession for us with
[55:43] us for what to bring us that
[55:47] intercession is to bring us to God's
[55:50] perfect will for God's will in our life
[55:53] well no wonder we might not know cuz I
[55:57] don't always know what God's will is for
[55:59] me
[55:59] you know we wake up on Sunday morning
[56:02] that was a pretty easy one to figure out
[56:03] we take shower and get ready to come to
[56:05] church I'm prepare for the service and
[56:09] you come and attend and those things are
[56:12] pretty simple but what about all the
[56:13] other times and all the other hours and
[56:16] days and hours that we spend I was
[56:19] spending it selfishly are we spending it
[56:21] for self gate are we doing something for
[56:23] the Lord you know it struck me and you
[56:27] know you know I have always had a very
[56:31] high opinion of brother Roger Collins
[56:35] and and my thoughts for him towards him
[56:40] and our friendship
[56:41] together and I've always known him to be
[56:43] a man of God that me some may like to
[56:45] hear Minister some may not that's
[56:47] there's neither here nor there to me but
[56:49] but that's just true he saw a person now
[56:51] same thing with me it'd be the same with
[56:53] you I mean he's just even in your normal
[56:56] life some people like hanging around you
[56:58] and some people don't but you preach to
[57:00] not some people like being around some
[57:02] people don't that's just the way it is
[57:03] anyway but he said something the other
[57:07] day that struck me now we have
[57:08] conversation like because we've been
[57:10] working together a lot but he told a man
[57:13] the other day and I believe it was
[57:16] anyway one of the jobs I believe it was
[57:18] he and he told the man that because
[57:21] brother Roger doesn't charge a whole lot
[57:23] for what we did and the man said well
[57:26] you
[57:27] the next closest person was way above
[57:29] what you charge me and brother Roger
[57:33] said well sir I'm not in this to make a
[57:35] look to make myself rich I'm not in this
[57:39] to build some great organization I'm not
[57:41] in this to make some great company he
[57:44] said I'm in this just to try to earn a
[57:46] little bit of money that I can put
[57:47] towards the Lord and for the work of the
[57:50] Lord in the ministry well what a
[57:53] testimony you know to tell a total
[57:56] stranger and someone don't even know if
[57:58] he was eaten ate is don't know the man
[58:00] from Adam don't know him at all and to
[58:02] give that testimony that's powerful and
[58:05] that was tremendous to me a witness to
[58:07] me I thought you know that's exactly
[58:09] right that's what we do what we do
[58:12] whether it's a bigger sum or smaller sum
[58:14] where we do it because we want to do as
[58:17] unto the Lord it's all that we do this
[58:20] unto the Lord not to build a kingdom
[58:21] here not to build some nice plush
[58:24] flowery bed of ease that we fly through
[58:26] on to make that in our lives to be for
[58:32] the Lord now the hard part it's the easy
[58:35] part for the Christian the hard part for
[58:37] those that are is verse 28 now they
[58:40] didn't remember that intercessions made
[58:42] according to the will of God not
[58:45] according to your
[58:46] will according to the will of God so
[58:50] remember that because that's where the
[58:52] rub comes and we know verse 28 we know
[58:59] that all things work together for good
[59:04] to them that love God to them who are
[59:08] the called according to his purpose so
[59:11] we know that not every other thing not
[59:16] 90% of things but we know because again
[59:21] we are of the spirit we know that all
[59:25] things are going to work together for
[59:28] our good both when that happens it's not
[59:33] always easy for those things to work
[59:37] together for our good because a lot of
[59:39] times we don't know what is for our good
[59:43] we may not know what the will of God is
[59:45] for us tomorrow the Lord may send you
[59:49] someplace to go pray for something here
[59:50] to go minister to somebody or so we
[59:53] don't know what tomorrow holds we don't
[59:55] know what the afternoon holds we know
[59:57] what we're doing right now but what the
[59:59] will of God is there we know that all
[1:00:02] things are going to work together now
[1:00:05] again
[1:00:06] the rub sometimes those things working
[1:00:09] in them in the way they are may come
[1:00:11] against what the little kingdom you're
[1:00:15] trying to build maybe or the or the the
[1:00:17] self-righteousness or the building of
[1:00:22] your own kingdom in your own ego and it
[1:00:25] may rub against what you want to be
[1:00:28] doing can always do what we want to do
[1:00:32] so it may rub against what we want to do
[1:00:36] but we know it's gonna work together for
[1:00:38] our good it's got to work together it'll
[1:00:44] rub against your flesh many times it'll
[1:00:47] be hard to go through sometimes it may
[1:00:50] make a tunnel so dark you can't see the
[1:00:53] light on the other end but it's gonna
[1:00:54] work together
[1:00:56] somehow because God has it in control
[1:00:59] somehow it works together for two people
[1:01:01] say well how could this happen
[1:01:03] oh why would this child die why would
[1:01:06] they have had why would God have allowed
[1:01:07] the dark ages why could this be this way
[1:01:09] God allows those things to work every
[1:01:13] bit of it together for the good of his
[1:01:15] children to be in His perfect will led
[1:01:20] by his spirit to be in the position to
[1:01:23] do what we can for him why do we do
[1:01:28] certain things we do I was gonna be a
[1:01:30] little more specific and and maybe a
[1:01:32] mine and Sonia's life I don't know you
[1:01:34] don't always understand it sometimes
[1:01:37] I've had it happen sometimes where the
[1:01:41] Lord gives just a little glimpse maybe
[1:01:43] afterwards I say this was done this way
[1:01:46] for that purpose maybe just for one
[1:01:49] person's right I had some you go to
[1:01:53] sister or Sonia Tabitha go to sister
[1:01:56] Holmquist funeral and saw Claire
[1:01:59] Peterson there and or Chloe Peterson and
[1:02:04] who I forgot the connection anyway
[1:02:09] it was it was probably through Austin I
[1:02:11] think Austin and Claire moved up to Ohio
[1:02:14] and but anyways people that came to our
[1:02:16] church in Florida they came and were
[1:02:19] part of the church like halfway you know
[1:02:20] like after we were there for a year year
[1:02:22] and a half something like that and it
[1:02:23] was a man and his wife and his two
[1:02:25] children and and they came to church and
[1:02:28] I you know we had somebody to church to
[1:02:32] invite them and they came and they
[1:02:34] became a part of our journey they like
[1:02:37] their eyes became opening baptized they
[1:02:39] saw the message and and praise the Lord
[1:02:42] you know dairy they're still in it today
[1:02:44] and but I guess somehow they the family
[1:02:50] member met up in Ohio or somewhere and
[1:02:53] the sister Denise is actually her name
[1:02:56] Dave somehow through to Chloe
[1:03:01] Peterson to Tabitha to give me the
[1:03:04] number to call her and hurts our
[1:03:07] reason II was that I was the one that
[1:03:09] led her to the Lord
[1:03:11] well honestly friends I never thought I
[1:03:14] never occurred to me that that was the
[1:03:18] way she felt about it because you know
[1:03:22] there was a brother invited in the
[1:03:24] church and they came and I just preached
[1:03:25] the word I just had the doors open and
[1:03:27] preach the word but in her mind and her
[1:03:31] feelings that that was how she came to
[1:03:34] this truth attributing of that to me I'm
[1:03:38] like well it's not me I had that - God
[1:03:42] had nothing to do with it but when these
[1:03:45] little things happen you think why did I
[1:03:48] even do that or why did I even go there
[1:03:50] or why did I even say that what was this
[1:03:53] accomplishing what was this doing Lord I
[1:03:56] really believe this was your perfect
[1:03:57] wheel book why and maybe the Lord would
[1:04:00] just show you a little glimpse of
[1:04:01] something to help you understand I'm a I
[1:04:05] I mean you ever heard that you ever
[1:04:07] heard the old saying you had to go
[1:04:08] around your fist to get to your phone
[1:04:09] you know that happens a lot in the
[1:04:11] Christian life the Lord might have to
[1:04:14] change this circumstance and move these
[1:04:15] people and change this over here and
[1:04:17] break this to happen that way in this
[1:04:19] and so that this chain events can bring
[1:04:21] it all around to this one thing that God
[1:04:23] wants to accomplish right in somebody's
[1:04:26] life he'll do this change this move this
[1:04:28] here move that there do this and cause
[1:04:30] it all just to be for that one point
[1:04:32] that one purpose that one moment it may
[1:04:36] not be but one minute of time in human
[1:04:39] life but that one time brought about the
[1:04:43] perfect will of God for that person for
[1:04:45] that whole family whatever that one
[1:04:48] thing that one place that one point all
[1:04:52] things work together for our good now
[1:04:55] who are the ones that it works together
[1:04:57] for to them that love God now do you
[1:05:01] love God oh you can go on the any
[1:05:04] Christian Church today and not guarantee
[1:05:06] every hand would go up right do you love
[1:05:08] God everybody yes and they may not say
[1:05:11] anything but even you going maybe to the
[1:05:14] Catholics
[1:05:15] the Presbyterians and Lutheran's and
[1:05:18] Pentecostals and charismatics and
[1:05:20] walking to certain these big mega
[1:05:22] churches - do you love Donnell they
[1:05:24] would just every one of them but you let
[1:05:28] the real pressure hit and that's when
[1:05:30] you find out for sure because there's a
[1:05:33] lot of people that have a passing
[1:05:36] affinity for the Lord right there's a
[1:05:38] lot of people that have an affection for
[1:05:40] the Lord maybe even a filial love like
[1:05:42] Peter talked about in John 21 may have a
[1:05:45] little figlio lover human love for the
[1:05:48] Lord and something that's just kind of a
[1:05:50] superficial surface type of love that
[1:05:53] they think that they have for God well
[1:05:55] God's been good to me - yeah I love him
[1:05:58] do you know God loved you even when you
[1:06:00] weren't good even when you didn't know
[1:06:04] it even when you denied him he still
[1:06:06] loved you that was his choice
[1:06:10] what is our choice do we love him
[1:06:12] because he did something for us
[1:06:14] do we love him because he saved us do we
[1:06:17] love Him because He healed us do we love
[1:06:20] him because he's been so good to us do
[1:06:22] we love him because he's always there
[1:06:23] for us
[1:06:24] do we leaven because he's the matchless
[1:06:26] Savior because he's our Lord and God do
[1:06:29] we love him because of any circumstance
[1:06:31] that God's ever done if you love forms
[1:06:35] based on anything then when that thing
[1:06:38] that it's based on is removed you don't
[1:06:40] have love anymore if that condition is
[1:06:45] removed the love goes with it if you
[1:06:49] really love God you love him
[1:06:51] unconditionally just like He loves us so
[1:06:54] under the worst conditions all things
[1:06:56] work together for those that love God if
[1:06:59] it's under the best or worse conditions
[1:07:02] you still love it
[1:07:04] whether he takes away the most dear
[1:07:07] thing in your life you still love it
[1:07:08] whether he's changed the most you had
[1:07:13] all this money in property land whatever
[1:07:15] and every bit of it's gone
[1:07:16] you still love it and some people look
[1:07:20] at it and say well I just I just can't
[1:07:22] do
[1:07:22] anymore I just can't stand this anymore
[1:07:25] God so I'm gonna give to you more than
[1:07:26] you what you can stand right amen amen
[1:07:28] and when it comes to our family and our
[1:07:31] children and things like that that's a
[1:07:33] whole nother episode too that's a whole
[1:07:35] other thing you notice parents you do
[1:07:38] anything for your children for as a
[1:07:41] spouse you do anything for your spouse
[1:07:42] you love them but when it comes to
[1:07:47] between that and God what's the choice
[1:07:52] now it doesn't always come down to that
[1:07:55] fortunately we're not so hard-headed
[1:07:58] that those things happen a lot but God
[1:08:00] uses those things to bring us into his
[1:08:02] into his perfect will that love is a
[1:08:09] agapo agape love
[1:08:11] that's God's love but it's a verb if you
[1:08:15] go look at it in the Greek you'll see
[1:08:17] that that word is a verb so what it's
[1:08:20] saying is that verb that which which is
[1:08:25] something that's an action right a verb
[1:08:27] is an action so this love is an action
[1:08:30] it's not just the regular agape love of
[1:08:32] God this is God's love in action this is
[1:08:35] a verb so it's something that that we
[1:08:39] see in being in action for the Lord all
[1:08:42] things work together for them that are
[1:08:44] in action for the Lord somebody and
[1:08:47] those that are doing something for God
[1:08:49] those that are living their lives for
[1:08:51] the purpose of of being pleasing to the
[1:08:54] Lord all these things work together
[1:08:56] because it's an action that we have that
[1:09:00] causes these things to work together in
[1:09:04] the obedience of the Lord in the Lord's
[1:09:06] will of course making intercession see
[1:09:09] how I think see that the 26:17 verses
[1:09:12] all manage to come together perfectly
[1:09:15] together amen
[1:09:17] bringing about the the purposeful
[1:09:20] results that God had in his mind before
[1:09:22] the foundation of the world we may not
[1:09:24] know what his ways are higher than our
[1:09:26] ways his thoughts higher than our
[1:09:28] thoughts so we may not know we don't
[1:09:30] always know the will of God we don't
[1:09:33] always
[1:09:34] know what is the the perfect will of God
[1:09:37] but sometimes we can get so eased in
[1:09:41] Zion that we forget about those things
[1:09:43] that's happening you know it's like it's
[1:09:45] like the Eagle stirring the nest you
[1:09:48] know remember have talked about the
[1:09:49] Eagles turning the nest when the Eagle
[1:09:52] builds the nest she builds a nice big
[1:09:54] nest and then she puts thorns and
[1:09:56] stickers and briars and stuff underneath
[1:09:58] it and then she comes she gets rabbits
[1:10:01] fur and birds feathers whatever and she
[1:10:04] packs out all dykes nice down and nice
[1:10:07] and neat just like she's sliding in your
[1:10:09] beautiful comfortable bed to go to sleep
[1:10:10] at night you know it's all nice and
[1:10:12] comfortable in this it feels good when
[1:10:15] the little babies are born and they come
[1:10:17] out and they they walk around on how
[1:10:19] nice that beautiful animal fur isn't and
[1:10:21] it feels so good but then when that
[1:10:24] little that little eagle gets a little
[1:10:26] bit older mama starts taking so that fur
[1:10:29] and throwing it away so that little bird
[1:10:32] who is supposed to be getting to the
[1:10:34] place of Independence and going out on
[1:10:36] their own it's getting too too
[1:10:38] comfortable in that nest it moms like
[1:10:41] nope do you get too comfortable in this
[1:10:42] nest you'll just sit here and rot coz
[1:10:44] mama ain't gonna go feed you all the
[1:10:46] time
[1:10:48] mom's not gonna come feed you all the
[1:10:51] times you don't want to see if you set
[1:10:52] in this nest you're just gonna stay here
[1:10:54] die so what she got to do she's got to
[1:10:58] take a little bit of the fur out and
[1:11:00] throw it over the side and you know the
[1:11:02] little birdie he feels good and all of a
[1:11:04] sudden he comes over that place doesn't
[1:11:05] have any fur de hits authorities oh that
[1:11:08] that hurt and she takes another little
[1:11:13] bit of that firm throws it down and you
[1:11:15] know before long that nest is so
[1:11:16] uncomfortable for that little that
[1:11:18] little birdie said I got to get out of
[1:11:20] here I can't stand this nest
[1:11:21] anymore this was beautiful whistles I
[1:11:23] loved it but now I can't stand it eating
[1:11:26] then he goes out on his own and he's
[1:11:28] flying around in the heavens and he
[1:11:30] finds his food and he eats and he goes
[1:11:32] and he flies around he and what is he
[1:11:34] doing he's accomplishing the purpose and
[1:11:37] he was built for he's accomplishing the
[1:11:39] reason that God made him and he's flying
[1:11:41] around the heavens he's doing exactly
[1:11:42] what God commanded her called or built
[1:11:45] in to do and that's what God does for us
[1:11:48] sometime God's got to just pull a little
[1:11:50] bit he wants to get us in a place of
[1:11:53] desperation that were that that our that
[1:11:56] our lies not again we just got to go
[1:11:59] back for just a moment please
[1:12:01] we'll go back for just a moment again
[1:12:02] not forgetting that God's God's not
[1:12:05] making it to work it's not providing for
[1:12:09] you which to me out of all the things
[1:12:12] that's been going on in this country in
[1:12:14] the world and the people begging in the
[1:12:16] food lines
[1:12:18] oh my I've seen pictures of the food
[1:12:21] banks of the cars lined up for miles
[1:12:23] just to get food at a food bank because
[1:12:26] they had no food how many how many your
[1:12:28] cupboards are empty anybody anything
[1:12:30] here your cupboards empty no is your gas
[1:12:33] tank empty is your bank account empty or
[1:12:36] is God taking care of you has God been
[1:12:39] there for us and all the midst of all
[1:12:41] that and everything that's been going on
[1:12:43] and lining up and nothing wrong with the
[1:12:45] people the food banks not nothing wrong
[1:12:46] with those that are in need jesus said
[1:12:50] the poor you always have with you we
[1:12:52] know that that will happen these people
[1:12:53] may not have been poor but they're in
[1:12:55] need now but thank God he's been there
[1:12:58] for us and he's protected us that he's
[1:13:01] kept us and in Florida kept their
[1:13:04] unemployment checks coming in give us a
[1:13:06] little boost with the stimulus money
[1:13:07] again and things you know God's just
[1:13:10] provided God is took care of us and I'm
[1:13:14] so thankful God is there but we don't
[1:13:16] want to take that and become comfortable
[1:13:18] either we don't want to take it become
[1:13:20] East we need to let that verb of love
[1:13:23] continue to work in our lives
[1:13:25] we're in what
[1:13:28] the work for the Lord Amen remember
[1:13:30] everybody's under that pressure
[1:13:31] everybody is it's just how you react to
[1:13:35] it what you do by it God desires for us
[1:13:39] to become closer to him you go back and
[1:13:43] read Joe I was gonna read it today but
[1:13:46] for second time it's getting away from
[1:13:47] us
[1:13:48] go back and read Joe again refresh your
[1:13:50] memory go through it slowly the first
[1:13:52] three chapters at least the first two
[1:13:54] and go through just look what Joe went
[1:13:56] through God said that Joe was perfect
[1:14:00] and upright before him and that was
[1:14:04] God's testimony about Joe now didn't
[1:14:07] matter what Joe look at who looked at
[1:14:09] when he got up in the morning in the
[1:14:10] mirror and the proverbial mirror mum had
[1:14:12] beers in but just think you get up and
[1:14:14] look at yourself it's more important
[1:14:17] that what God sees you as what you see
[1:14:20] of yourself now if you see if yourself
[1:14:23] in the word that that's the way that God
[1:14:26] sees you but God saw job is a perfect
[1:14:29] and upright man one that feared God and
[1:14:32] eschewed or turn away from evil I
[1:14:34] believe God's looking for the same type
[1:14:37] of individual today and I believe God's
[1:14:40] looking for that in us today but Joe fit
[1:14:43] that bill Joe was that man in my opinion
[1:14:45] I doubt I've never met him maybe the
[1:14:47] Lord when I get a chance to ask him if
[1:14:49] he really felt Joe when you were acumen
[1:14:52] and blood was coursing through your
[1:14:54] veins did you actually feel like you
[1:14:56] were perfect and upright before God I've
[1:15:00] been sure to guess that you probably
[1:15:01] will say no just like every one of us
[1:15:04] would probably say no but it doesn't
[1:15:07] matter because it's the way God saw now
[1:15:10] the thing that comes along in jobs loss
[1:15:13] he's perfect and upright probably does
[1:15:17] not see himself that way so we'll go
[1:15:19] that I don't know he may have I just
[1:15:22] doubt he did amen cuz I know I believe
[1:15:25] how God looks upon his children today
[1:15:28] and I'm sure there's none of us that
[1:15:30] think that way oh yes I'm perfect
[1:15:32] complete than not yeah you could lay a
[1:15:37] finger to me yeah every one of us has
[1:15:39] our shortcomings right every one of us
[1:15:41] has those gaps think I I would almost
[1:15:44] guarantee job didn't feel that way but
[1:15:46] God felt that way about it
[1:15:48] but now if you're in the position now
[1:15:51] see cuz you got to know who you are if
[1:15:53] you're in that position because remember
[1:15:55] all this God is using so that we become
[1:15:58] closer to him it's like the toothpaste
[1:16:01] tube I mentioned to you before you know
[1:16:03] if you take the lid off a toothpaste
[1:16:04] tube and you grab it you squeeze it in
[1:16:06] the middle you know some of that
[1:16:08] toothpaste is going to shoot out it is
[1:16:12] it can't be in the tomb anymore because
[1:16:13] of pressures too great they can't stand
[1:16:16] it well that's those people that say
[1:16:18] well I love God yeah I'm in the church
[1:16:20] yeah you're in the tube I go to church
[1:16:23] and I yeah I'm a faithful member of so
[1:16:26] in some denomination or this baguette
[1:16:28] church or something yeah I go to
[1:16:29] wherever it is and and I'm thankful to
[1:16:33] it yeah well praise the Lord that's
[1:16:35] great but then when that squeeze comes
[1:16:36] when that toothpaste ooze get squeezed
[1:16:38] where are you gonna be because those
[1:16:42] that don't get squeezed out just come
[1:16:44] closer together the other part of the
[1:16:47] toothpaste just goes into that tubing
[1:16:49] and squeezes then it comes out much
[1:16:51] closer together that's all God wants us
[1:16:54] just to become more like him
[1:16:55] God wants just to be closer to him and
[1:16:58] all that's going on he's doing all of
[1:17:00] this to bring us closer to him now God
[1:17:03] now Joe was already perfect and upright
[1:17:05] feared God eschewed evil so if in job's
[1:17:10] fine let's just just paint a picture for
[1:17:12] a moment and jobs mine maybe in your
[1:17:14] mind you think well you know I'm full of
[1:17:17] faults and mistakes and I have
[1:17:19] shortcomings and and and all these
[1:17:22] things and and you know you really don't
[1:17:24] have a maybe a large opinion as a
[1:17:27] Christian in your mind of yourself then
[1:17:31] when those things come assist you that
[1:17:33] God's looking a job and maybe job
[1:17:35] obviously wasn't thinking that way about
[1:17:37] himself but then this trial comes and
[1:17:39] Satan's walking around in heaven and God
[1:17:41] says what are you doing here
[1:17:42] Lisa's whopping
[1:17:44] the earth looking around going to and
[1:17:46] fro and and God God suggest to to the
[1:17:51] Satan God's suggestion to Satan Satan
[1:17:54] didn't suggest it to God God suggested
[1:17:57] it to to Satan have you considered job
[1:18:01] he's my servant he's perfect he's
[1:18:04] upright he fears me he loves me fears me
[1:18:07] he turns away from evil and Satan said I
[1:18:10] have but you got a hinge around him
[1:18:12] you've got him hedged I can't touch him
[1:18:15] praise the Lord
[1:18:17] not wonderful to know the world
[1:18:18] Christian can be where we can live our
[1:18:21] lives in a place to work it's hedged
[1:18:23] about with God's holy angels that not
[1:18:25] not a finger of Satan can touch praise
[1:18:29] the Lord
[1:18:29] but remember now it only tastes one
[1:18:32] teeny little gap for him to get it
[1:18:34] wedged himself in there and get it but
[1:18:36] God keeps us hedged and protected
[1:18:39] because there's only it for somehow
[1:18:42] there's a reason he's able to get in
[1:18:44] there's because God's allowed it God's
[1:18:46] allowed it it's for a reason and if it's
[1:18:48] fir and gods allowed it for a reason and
[1:18:51] Lord just help me to fulfill Romans 8:28
[1:18:55] because I love you Lord and regardless
[1:18:58] of what trial or whatever come I'm still
[1:19:01] gonna love you regardless I don't love
[1:19:03] because you save me I don't love you
[1:19:04] clothes you heal me I don't love because
[1:19:06] you always been there and all those
[1:19:08] things are good I appreciate you God has
[1:19:10] those attributes about it but I love him
[1:19:12] just because he is period as long as he
[1:19:15] exists and that will be through eternity
[1:19:17] I'll still love it love will never die
[1:19:21] but let's just say for a moment Joe felt
[1:19:23] that way about himself when that trial
[1:19:25] came and Satan and God said I'll take
[1:19:27] down that hedge and he said you can do
[1:19:31] anything Zinn job but touch joke don't
[1:19:34] touch Joe you know don't don't lay a
[1:19:36] finger on Toby's a finger and Satan
[1:19:38] fingers spirit don't lay a finger on Joe
[1:19:42] so what is Satan go about doing he kills
[1:19:45] his kids and he takes all of his wealth
[1:19:47] and he kills all of his animals and they
[1:19:49] his all the servants and and he's
[1:19:51] basically just got a couple of servants
[1:19:53] here and there and his wife but Satan
[1:19:55] took everything from him and God shaved
[1:20:00] his head fell on his face and worshiped
[1:20:03] God he took that and became closer to
[1:20:08] God he was a man that was upright and
[1:20:11] perfect before God and yet through all
[1:20:14] of that he got closer to God what does
[1:20:19] that prove to me that proves to me that
[1:20:22] a person that in God's mind is perfect
[1:20:25] and upright pin still get closer to him
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:30] as he fell on his face and he worshiped
[1:20:32] God and did it again
[1:20:36] Satan's going around what you doing here
[1:20:39] again I'm going to in front earth again
[1:20:42] it's what what happened with Joe well
[1:20:44] you know you did all this this and this
[1:20:47] but they said well you know I'm
[1:20:50] paraphrasing of course God didn't say
[1:20:52] this what did you do when you did all
[1:20:58] that to him Satan what was his reaction
[1:20:59] I don't want to say cuz he knows what
[1:21:05] happened he knows what job did job
[1:21:08] continued to worship thought even though
[1:21:09] everything was taken from him you know
[1:21:11] why because Satan just like he does you
[1:21:14] he believes that you only love and serve
[1:21:18] God because of something God did for you
[1:21:22] he absolutely believes that that's why
[1:21:27] he told God you take down that hedge
[1:21:29] then I'll make him curse you to your
[1:21:31] face
[1:21:31] now some some do but they weren't his to
[1:21:36] begin with but the others they just come
[1:21:39] closer to God they say Lord I don't
[1:21:42] understand this but I need a little
[1:21:43] nourishment right now and they snuggle
[1:21:45] up to his breasts and they they get
[1:21:47] nourishment and they love him and he
[1:21:49] loves me they are together praise the
[1:21:52] Lord
[1:21:55] so I'll tell you what I'll let you I'll
[1:22:00] let you have joke
[1:22:01] you can touch his flesh but don't you
[1:22:04] take his life now it's amazing what you
[1:22:06] can live through right he said don't
[1:22:09] take his life you can do also whatever
[1:22:11] to Joe what he's gotten him personally
[1:22:14] now but now don't don't don't take his
[1:22:18] life now a lot of people and I have
[1:22:21] before look at this scenario with Joe a
[1:22:25] job was the flesh man just like us
[1:22:26] standing sitting here today this is not
[1:22:29] a fictional character we didn't get this
[1:22:31] out of the Bugs Bunny cartoons friend
[1:22:33] job was a real man flashing blood had
[1:22:35] human children and a wife just like you
[1:22:38] know the humans do he was a man not not
[1:22:42] a fictional character was a man and even
[1:22:46] in this and I think well then Satan
[1:22:50] afflicted job with sore boils all
[1:22:53] anybody can take that I mean that's hard
[1:22:56] that would be rough but more than that
[1:23:00] look at how Satan touch Joe the way that
[1:23:05] Satan touched Joe Wade farther more than
[1:23:08] the boils I mean boys are just flesh
[1:23:11] that's just you know he's sitting there
[1:23:13] scraping on when there's a sheep and
[1:23:15] he's scraping his balls and the dead
[1:23:17] flesh is falling off and he's set in
[1:23:19] there but the attack that was worse than
[1:23:23] the boils was when Satan got on Joe's
[1:23:26] wife when Satan got on jokes white and
[1:23:31] Joe's white came up to him and looked at
[1:23:34] him with anger and contempt and said why
[1:23:37] don't you this curse God and die that
[1:23:40] was the lowest point my opinion the
[1:23:43] lowest point Joe ever had when his own
[1:23:46] flesh and blood his own bone of his bone
[1:23:49] flesh of his flesh declared to him just
[1:23:52] to curse God and die now she wasn't done
[1:23:55] that under normal circumstances that was
[1:23:57] a devil that got on her to say that
[1:24:00] that attack was way worse than the
[1:24:02] children wait worse than the servants
[1:24:04] way worse than the animals the wealth
[1:24:06] way worse than the boils was his own
[1:24:10] flesh of flesh bone upon coming and
[1:24:13] telling him that shook him to the very
[1:24:16] core of his be and yet Joe broke from
[1:24:20] rose from that and he said shall we
[1:24:23] receive good of God and not even shall
[1:24:27] receive all the things that God has
[1:24:29] blessed us with done for us and given to
[1:24:31] us and not the things that are needful
[1:24:34] for us the things that are harsh and
[1:24:36] sometimes hardened sometimes divided and
[1:24:39] break and take away I got had
[1:24:43] friendships of my life friend that I
[1:24:45] cherished and treasured that are no
[1:24:48] longer friendships and probably never
[1:24:50] will be again
[1:24:51] that's hard that's very very taxing and
[1:24:59] troubling and difficult but it's just a
[1:25:03] fact now is there is there anything
[1:25:07] wrong with my friend no anything wrong
[1:25:09] with me no it's just God's purpose why I
[1:25:13] don't know why did Paul and Barnabas
[1:25:16] attack each other we're at each other's
[1:25:18] throats to the point that they had such
[1:25:20] sharp contention that they had to
[1:25:22] separate and one go one way and one go
[1:25:26] the other fine
[1:25:28] so Paul could go to this place and
[1:25:31] preach the gospel and Barnabas could go
[1:25:33] to this place and preach the gospel and
[1:25:35] not both of them go to one place and
[1:25:37] preach the gospel he had two places they
[1:25:40] got preached the gospel nothing wrong
[1:25:43] with Barnabas nothing wrong with Paul
[1:25:45] it's God's purpose God caused it to
[1:25:49] happen so two places can get ministered
[1:25:51] to instead of one now
[1:25:54] that's my simplistic way of looking at
[1:25:56] that but it's still true it's just way
[1:25:58] God works job said though though he's
[1:26:03] yeah I will trust him he said shell
[1:26:08] would receive good and not bad at the
[1:26:12] hand of the Lord the Lord giveth and the
[1:26:15] Lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[1:26:19] the Lord I don't tell you I didn't know
[1:26:23] it as well as I do today but that became
[1:26:26] our battling crime when the Lord took
[1:26:28] our son that was hard even only after a
[1:26:32] day and a half that was the greatest
[1:26:34] hardest time I would say in my life I
[1:26:38] have probably my wife too but I'd say in
[1:26:40] my life but God worked it for a purpose
[1:26:44] God's worked it for a reason and that
[1:26:47] became my battle cry the whole time the
[1:26:50] Lord get the Lord take away that should
[1:26:52] be the name of the Lord
[1:26:54] tomorrow may not be like today next week
[1:26:57] may not be like this week things may
[1:26:59] change and they may change drastically
[1:27:02] but we don't know but we do know what we
[1:27:07] do know we may not know that but what we
[1:27:09] do know is it all things are gonna work
[1:27:14] together for our good because we love
[1:27:17] God our love is unconditional it's God's
[1:27:20] love that we've returned back to him ago
[1:27:22] over love in action that love in action
[1:27:25] shows up regardless of what takes place
[1:27:27] I still love him if you still love him
[1:27:30] you're gonna stay with I mean you're
[1:27:32] going to get closer to God you're gonna
[1:27:34] take these hardships in these tough
[1:27:36] times and you're gonna get closer to God
[1:27:37] with him become more like him because
[1:27:43] those that don't love him like that are
[1:27:45] going to be the people that fall away
[1:27:47] and they're gonna go away I don't
[1:27:50] understand this I can't understand
[1:27:54] none of us may comprehend what God's
[1:27:57] doing but the point is I don't have to
[1:28:00] understand it I just have to believe it
[1:28:02] if God's working it for his purpose for
[1:28:05] his will then it's all going to come
[1:28:06] together for our good all right amen
[1:28:09] praise the Lord we're all going to be
[1:28:11] there together and as to them who are
[1:28:13] the called according to God's purpose
[1:28:16] you know the later we get to the end of
[1:28:21] this time and they're taught and the
[1:28:25] higher we get on that pyramid ladder the
[1:28:29] less room there is at the top so as we
[1:28:33] climb this ladder of statute of a
[1:28:36] perfect man we're getting to the place
[1:28:38] to where some fell away here and some
[1:28:42] fell away there and some fell away here
[1:28:44] and some fell away there and the more
[1:28:45] drastic the cut is at the top the fewer
[1:28:48] there is left now there's many that fall
[1:28:51] asleep in the Lord of course those will
[1:28:53] be there but the alive and remain group
[1:28:56] is just going to be a small group just
[1:28:59] going to be a small representation there
[1:29:04] at the top but the more I've said this
[1:29:08] before the more a couple spends time
[1:29:12] together and it can be any couple it
[1:29:14] doesn't have to be a married couple
[1:29:15] married couples just spend more time and
[1:29:17] more intimate time together so it makes
[1:29:19] a difference but the more time people
[1:29:21] spend together the more time it any two
[1:29:23] individuals spend together the more they
[1:29:25] become like each other and the more they
[1:29:29] look like each other and I believe
[1:29:32] that's exactly the purpose God's trying
[1:29:35] to do he's just trying to get us to the
[1:29:38] place that we that we spend more time
[1:29:41] with him that we become closer like him
[1:29:44] that we look more like him which is the
[1:29:47] reflection of the word the word is who
[1:29:50] he is more like the word so that she
[1:29:53] becomes him flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:29:56] his bone life of his life spirit of his
[1:29:58] spirit everything that God does for that
[1:30:02] purpose is to bring
[1:30:03] us into his image and more like him
[1:30:06] closer to him he wants to proclaim Lord
[1:30:13] I want to be closer to you I want to be
[1:30:16] more like you and closer to you morning
[1:30:18] and all this is going on in my life all
[1:30:21] that's going on in this country in the
[1:30:23] world Lord just helped me that my life
[1:30:25] can become more like you amen
[1:30:29] you know I'll say this and I hope Austin
[1:30:33] doesn't get embarrassed her Hughley but
[1:30:38] there was a time when me and my wife
[1:30:40] David I got a picture over my dresser of
[1:30:45] us and we were about 18 HF yes dating
[1:30:49] him
[1:30:49] this is it same man well and you know I
[1:30:53] you know high school was a blur for me
[1:30:56] they often just graduated so
[1:30:58] congratulations well glad you were able
[1:31:00] to make it you both did okay well
[1:31:03] congratulations to both of you we think
[1:31:07] well we said we made you're just
[1:31:10] starting but anyway I thought my school
[1:31:13] is a blur to me and it was a blur
[1:31:16] because I only cared about one thing and
[1:31:20] that was she's sitting on the back row I
[1:31:23] didn't care what grades I got I didn't
[1:31:25] care what classes I took I enjoyed
[1:31:27] woodshop
[1:31:28] I enjoy band because she was in it but I
[1:31:30] I had just got to work think well you
[1:31:33] know that that's just the end all that's
[1:31:35] it you know that's she's everything I
[1:31:39] wanted need and that's life you know
[1:31:42] what that's that's gonna be the Adhan
[1:31:47] that that that became so all-consuming
[1:31:50] you know it just became a part of life
[1:31:53] thought well forget the place we're
[1:31:55] married then we get to the place we have
[1:31:57] kids and we get to but you soon realize
[1:32:00] when you get a little age on you that
[1:32:02] that was just one little chapter in the
[1:32:05] whole storybook and in the whole story
[1:32:09] book of life and and as my life as it
[1:32:12] was or my wife's or maybe be yours and
[1:32:14] that
[1:32:15] all consuming time it was for me it was
[1:32:19] all about her that's it for me it was
[1:32:22] all about her so being at that place at
[1:32:26] that time no meant a lot to me but you
[1:32:29] know it was just as all-consuming as it
[1:32:33] was that it's just that one little
[1:32:36] moment of time one little blip of life
[1:32:39] that moves on from there that you get to
[1:32:44] the next one and then you move to the
[1:32:46] next one then life goes on and then this
[1:32:49] changes over here and this is different
[1:32:51] and then it's just you begin to realize
[1:32:53] it was just it was just a part of life
[1:32:55] it was just a chapter of life in that
[1:33:00] position what we're going through now is
[1:33:03] is that it is that chapter it is that
[1:33:07] part of life it's this little time that
[1:33:10] gods give us right here amen
[1:33:13] far it's this place we don't know how
[1:33:15] long we'll be here I tell them up front
[1:33:17] I said you know you want to make it for
[1:33:18] next week I said yeah but I need to have
[1:33:21] the option to cancel it yeah that's no
[1:33:23] problem cancel when you're lying so we
[1:33:25] can't so if the board provides another
[1:33:27] place which I believe he he already has
[1:33:29] he already knows and just waiting from
[1:33:32] show me or open it up I literally
[1:33:35] believe and I'll just say this as I
[1:33:36] close I literally believe just between
[1:33:39] us that the Lord has the place and I
[1:33:44] believe that place is gonna is gonna
[1:33:47] open up in the next 60 90 days something
[1:33:51] to that effect it's just it's there it's
[1:33:54] just not in the place for us yet
[1:33:56] now whether that means a place to rent
[1:33:59] maybe that or that means financial
[1:34:02] ability to purchase something I don't
[1:34:04] know but it's just how I feel so you can
[1:34:08] feel something and not have all the
[1:34:09] details right you may not know
[1:34:11] specifically but I really believe this
[1:34:14] is going to happen
[1:34:15] and so if as it comes forth I believe
[1:34:18] that's going to happen and it's just
[1:34:19] another part our chapter live in life
[1:34:23] that God continues to bring us forward
[1:34:25] on amen
[1:34:26] but all of it all of it just like I was
[1:34:31] with my wife then my whole desire was to
[1:34:33] be closer to her now all my whole desire
[1:34:36] is to be closer to him
[1:34:37] I believe that sprinters are - I trust
[1:34:40] that's all of our desires today is to
[1:34:43] take this time and all that's going on
[1:34:45] and and whatever happens and just use
[1:34:48] that to to become closer to the Lord
[1:34:50] amen and I believe God will bless us by
[1:34:53] it to continue to help us keep us and
[1:34:56] strengthen us in this in this walk amen
[1:34:59] let's stand if we could I appreciate the
[1:35:05] Lord's goodness and blessing us and I do
[1:35:13] appreciate the place the Lord provided
[1:35:15] for us over here tonight I appreciate
[1:35:18] the Lord providing us this as I said the
[1:35:21] other day I didn't worry I've told y'all
[1:35:26] several times even from years ago if the
[1:35:29] Lord was to take us out of the other
[1:35:31] place he had another place for us
[1:35:32] because it's his work so he's
[1:35:36] responsible to it it's not yours not
[1:35:39] mine it's his right so if it's his and
[1:35:41] he's responsible to it not me not you
[1:35:43] he's responsible if he's responsible
[1:35:46] then I guarantee he's gonna take care of
[1:35:48] it exactly
[1:35:49] so when the Lord put on my heart that to
[1:35:53] have a provision he brought me right
[1:35:56] here I told you this is the first place
[1:35:58] the Lord brought me I've passed all the
[1:36:01] other hotels to come here just because
[1:36:03] that's what my heart now I went to I
[1:36:05] went to all the other hotels none of
[1:36:08] work days in across the street I told
[1:36:10] you last week was half this size and
[1:36:12] twice the money went to others they
[1:36:16] weren't opening theirs up yet the Lord
[1:36:18] brought me here so there's a reason I
[1:36:20] believe there's a reason why we're here
[1:36:22] I'm believing is to pray but there's
[1:36:26] I'm looking for something more permanent
[1:36:29] Amen that the Lord will the Lord opens
[1:36:31] up for us so amen
[1:36:33] you agree with me yes Amen god bless you
[1:36:37] gotta keep us healthy and strong
