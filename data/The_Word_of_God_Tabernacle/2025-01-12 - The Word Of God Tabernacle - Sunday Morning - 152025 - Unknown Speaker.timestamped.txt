[32:59] seeing my orthopedic
[33:01] surgeon um I'm having obviously problems

[33:09] possibly I might look into getting that
[33:12] replac I have my left knee replaced it
[33:15] was hard but now 15 16 years later I

[33:24] um I can't be walking bone to bone you

[33:31] but it's all up to Him Praise the Lord
[33:34] amen praise the Lord just remember just
[33:36] remember all the fires of California
[33:39] people U have a lot of Sympathy for the
[33:41] people obviously there humans there are
[33:45] people with Souls like just like you and
[33:47] I do and um there could be some
[33:49] Believers there I don't know that's up
[33:51] to the Lord but the destruction is just
[33:54] devastating uh I'm not necessarily
[33:57] overly conc concerned with a movie star
[33:59] or a wrestler or a basketball person or
[34:02] I mean they're just people like the rest
[34:04] of us uh seems like that's all the
[34:07] country seems to care about they keep
[34:09] putting you know this movie stars house
[34:11] bur down okay that's fine but what about
[34:13] Joe Blow here what about Mary Sue or
[34:15] what about you know a lot of people are
[34:17] losing houses of course there's not too
[34:18] many there probably aren't too many Joe
[34:20] Blows that have uh $80 million mansions
[34:23] in pal Pacific Palisades but you
[34:26] understand what I'm saying uh uh they're
[34:28] all people we're all we're all they're
[34:30] all just people like the rest of usen
[34:32] they may have a little more money or
[34:34] status what I don't know but um it is
[34:37] very devastating what's going on there
[34:39] now so uh we know the situation in
[34:42] California we know California is under
[34:44] judgment and yes uh I don't know I told
[34:47] my wife yesterday um maybe the Lord's
[34:50] running out whoever he wants to run out
[34:52] of the state before he sinks
[34:54] it I don't know uh I heard I heard an
[34:58] interview of a movie star and he said I
[35:00] don't know maybe they're trying to clear
[35:02] out California and I got to thinking
[35:04] well maybe the Lord is trying to clear
[35:06] the people that he wants out of there
[35:07] out of there before he sinks it I don't
[35:10] know but it's gone under we know that we
[35:12] know it's under judgment we know that
[35:14] yes uh and it was the and the Judgment
[35:17] we talk about California a lot but the
[35:19] Judgment was specific to La yes remember
[35:23] that yes he the in in the Judgment it
[35:26] was thou called thyself after the city
[35:29] of the angels Los Angeles so specific
[35:33] there so just remember that too but my
[35:35] heart does go out for the people so uh
[35:38] let's please remember that as well

[35:41] needs yes sir Lord Jesus we come before

[49:47] something else I was going to start on

[51:04] yes but we know that we are going to a
[51:06] place we know that there is a place
[51:09] prepared you said if you didn't you
[51:11] wouldn't have told us but you told us
[51:13] that you've gone to prepare a place Lord
[51:16] and that place we look forward to God at
[51:19] any moment in any time any moment we're
[51:22] looking for our loved ones to begin to
[51:24] appear before us Lord and won't be a
[51:28] minimum 30 days we'll be gone home to be
[51:30] with you yes Lord and we know God that
[51:33] as you call us home father at that time
[51:36] lord it'll be a great time for your
[51:38] bride but what a horrible time it'll be
[51:40] for the unbeliever the make believer God

[51:46] we're so thankful God that you've give
[51:48] us that precious promise that where you
[51:50] are there we will be Lord I pray that
[51:54] God you bless remain part of this
[51:55] service have your your way in it speak
[51:57] through these lips and on our ears we
[51:59] rebuke every demonic spirit that would
[52:01] try to hurt hinder and filtrate this
[52:03] service in any way that you would get
[52:05] the glory and the praise for all that is
[52:07] said and done here today we ask it and
[52:09] give it you all the glory in the name of
[52:11] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[52:15] praise the Lord I'm going to read one
[52:17] verse I'll let you be seated so we'll go
[52:19] down uh we'll go ahead and go is uh
[52:22] Hebrews chapter
[52:24] 13 amen
[52:27] we'll go ahead uh go ahead and go down
[52:28] to uh the 14th uh 14th verse because
[52:32] that's where I want to draw my text for
[52:34] here here we have uh for here have we no
[52:39] continuing City but we seek one to come
[52:43] amen amen you could be seated that is my
[52:46] topic today it may have been a little
[52:48] more than two minutes but maybe now you
[52:50] know maybe M can now knows why the Lord
[52:53] put that on his heart this morning amen
[52:56] because even as late as this morning
[53:00] uh I wasn't sure this was the way to go
[53:03] this was what the Lord wanted and more I
[53:06] prayed about it the more I looked at it
[53:08] the more I felt led to do it so then
[53:11] when Micah sang that song as much as the
[53:13] power of the Lord I felt today that just
[53:16] solidified it for me Saints amen you
[53:19] just I it's can't it's just hard for me
[53:22] to explain the feeling that I feel uh as
[53:25] a as your pastor p and uh ministering
[53:28] and for for that to come together like
[53:31] that amen it's just uh uh knowing that
[53:35] uh he could have sang it two weeks ago
[53:38] knowing that uh uh the Lord I I could
[53:41] have ignored that voice or whatever uh
[53:45] but and this was this thought came to me
[53:47] even before all the California fires and
[53:50] all that stuff that was going on uh but
[53:53] the truth of it is saying that we we
[53:57] here we have no continuing City amen
[54:00] here we have no continuing country here
[54:03] we have no continuing world we have no
[54:05] continuing Cosmos world Amen it will
[54:08] come to an end it will cease to exist at
[54:11] one point amen and what we live in now
[54:14] as bad as it is getting is is slowly
[54:17] starting to squeeze the bride out yes
[54:19] she's slowly start because we're not a
[54:21] part of this world yes amen you think
[54:23] the others would be squeezed out no no
[54:25] no uh we're being squeezed out because
[54:28] this is not our home it will be one day
[54:31] but it will only be after it has already
[54:34] been reconditioned and burned out all
[54:37] the sin even to the atmosphere is
[54:39] exploding so that it's fit for the bride
[54:41] to come back here and live on again it's
[54:44] only that time that it will be that
[54:46] we'll be in our uh glorified bodies in a
[54:50] condition to be able to live in a
[54:52] glorified place in a glorified state
[54:55] with the Lord Jesus so shall we ever be
[54:59] with the Lord amen Hebrews but I I do
[55:02] want to go back and read the rest of
[55:03] this though uh beginning with the eighth
[55:06] verse because of course we know we like
[55:08] U we brother Brandon Amed a lot on the
[55:10] eighth verse we do we trust this to be
[55:12] the truth amen I've talked to other
[55:15] so-called Christians not message
[55:17] Believers so so to speak but uh just
[55:20] other professing Christians and bring
[55:22] this you know Jesus Christ you same
[55:24] yesterday today and forever because
[55:26] people a lot of people in the Christian
[55:27] World want to talk about how things
[55:29] change and how you go with the changes
[55:32] and the new songs and the new music and
[55:34] the new preaching and the new uh uh
[55:37] translations of the Bible and the new
[55:39] things all the new stuff all the there
[55:42] just roll with the changes and you know
[55:44] but but uh my truth I came back to I
[55:47] said but the Bible says that Jesus
[55:49] Christ is the same today as he was
[55:52] yesterday God doesn't change amen amen
[55:55] so
[55:56] if we change outside of the perspective
[56:00] of who God is then that change is not
[56:02] good change is inevitable in our lives
[56:05] obviously change is inevitable in the
[56:07] world it's going to continue to change
[56:09] things in our lives are going to
[56:10] continue to change conditions in our
[56:12] lives are going to continue to change we
[56:14] ourselves are continuing to change uh
[56:18] fortunately hopefully most of it for the
[56:21] better we want to change for the better
[56:24] in the in the like of getting closer to
[56:26] God becoming more like God that should
[56:28] be our change amen but Jesus Christ the
[56:33] same yesterday today and forever I had
[56:36] that uh Christian Pur said well that's
[56:38] just a an allegory or I forgot what he
[56:41] called it but he just push it off of
[56:43] something that wasn't wasn't uh by the
[56:47] letter strictly
[56:49] true I'm like well if God changes then
[56:52] what do we have to hold what do we have
[56:54] to Anchor ourselves in if God changes
[56:56] right if God changes then his word
[56:58] changes because he changes but God can't
[57:01] change even brother brandham brother
[57:03] Bram said later in his ministry some
[57:06] things he preached early on that God
[57:07] straightened him out on later in his
[57:09] life later in his ministry you go back
[57:12] that's why I tell you if you go listen
[57:13] to the uh all the messages of course but
[57:16] if you listen to some of the earlier
[57:17] ones and later uh brother Brandon might
[57:20] correct it and he doesn't come out and
[57:22] say that I used to preach it this way
[57:24] now I preach it this way the only time I
[57:27] ever heard him say that was when he was
[57:29] in reference to the seals he did say
[57:32] that I when I preached it wrong uh
[57:34] preached it before I preached it wrong
[57:36] he took it from larsson's notes and
[57:38] thought that sounded really good so
[57:40] that's what he preached on the seals he
[57:42] said he was going to preach it wrong
[57:44] again that time in 63 until the Holy
[57:48] Spirit came the angel of the Lord come
[57:50] and straighten him out on it right amen
[57:54] amen that one thing I know but see
[57:57] things are continually changing but God
[57:59] does not change God's word cannot change
[58:02] my opinions my feelings my thoughts the
[58:05] way I look at things it can change amen
[58:09] uh even from being a younger man to an
[58:11] older man a lot of my perspectives have
[58:14] changed amen but God doesn't change
[58:18] right uh the world changes uh people
[58:20] used to walk people used to ride horses
[58:24] people used to ride horse and buggy
[58:26] people used to have uh these uh
[58:28] motorized cars that went 6 M an hour uh
[58:32] now we got uh things that go I was
[58:35] watching a plane uh when I was working
[58:37] the other day I took a little break I
[58:39] was uh doing some stuff I was actually
[58:42] working but I had to put this stuff on
[58:44] these clamps that I put up to hold the
[58:45] pipes and uh I make them all up and put
[58:48] them in my pouch I was doing all that
[58:49] and I saw a plane it was look like it
[58:51] was going straight up in the air but
[58:52] it's actually going across the sky but
[58:54] when it's way off it looks I justess
[58:56] going straight up and I look and I
[58:58] thought well it's you know and I go and
[59:00] I work a little bit and I look up and
[59:01] that plane is almost past the building
[59:04] already I think that plane's probably
[59:06] going 600 miles an hour and that Pals in
[59:09] comparison to rockets that we've sent up
[59:11] into the air I don't even know how fast
[59:13] they go I mean I I mean however many
[59:15] miles an hour they go it's just it's
[59:17] just unbelievable what man has been able
[59:19] to create we've gone from horse and
[59:22] buggy to cars to planes to Rockets uh
[59:25] things can continue to evolve but God
[59:28] cannot and does not change right amen
[59:32] thus here in this life this Cosmos we
[59:37] have no continuing City amen but we seek
[59:40] one that is to come look we uh uh Jesus
[59:45] Christ the same yesterday today and
[59:47] forever it is not an allegory it is not
[59:51] uh something that you make light of to
[59:54] say well that's just uh uh that's just
[59:57] something that's put in that that's
[59:59] that's God's word yeah amen he's the
[1:00:02] same now as he was 100 years ago
[1:00:04] thousand years ago 10 Generations ago uh
[1:00:08] 10 million years ago he's the same now
[1:00:11] amen amen into the eternities he's the
[1:00:14] same God now going into the eternities
[1:00:18] he's still the same God yes he does not
[1:00:20] change and if he doesn't change then his
[1:00:22] word doesn't change so we can depend on
[1:00:25] that word because it doesn't change
[1:00:29] amen be not carried about with divers
[1:00:32] that's various different kinds of and
[1:00:36] many manifold if you will and strange
[1:00:40] doctrines for it is a good thing that
[1:00:42] the heart be established with Grace
[1:00:45] isn't that wonderful not with Meats
[1:00:48] which have not profited them that have
[1:00:50] been occupied therein we talked about
[1:00:52] that the other day amen what did Brother
[1:00:55] brandom say make sure your doctrine's
[1:00:57] right amen no just live a simple humble
[1:01:01] Christian life amen praise the Lord
[1:01:03] Doctrine is important to make sure you
[1:01:06] that you follow the scripture according
[1:01:07] to the truth of it of course but his
[1:01:10] acclamation to all of to live that
[1:01:12] simple humble Christian life amen the
[1:01:14] meats have that not profited have that
[1:01:18] have thrown many people off that occupy
[1:01:20] themselves therein we have an altar
[1:01:24] whereof they have no right to eat would
[1:01:26] serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of
[1:01:28] those beasts whose blood is brought into
[1:01:31] the sanctuary by the high priest for sin
[1:01:33] are burned without the camp outside the
[1:01:36] camp amen amen we talked about going
[1:01:39] into the veil a few Services going
[1:01:42] Beyond the Veil into that place of the
[1:01:45] holies of holies the showbread the sh
[1:01:48] Glory the the the uh spirit and Truth
[1:01:52] amen this is done this purif ification
[1:01:56] done without the camp outside the camp
[1:01:59] for the benefit of the camp but without
[1:02:01] the camp wherefore Jesus also that he
[1:02:04] might sanctify the people with his own
[1:02:07] blood suffered without the gate amen he
[1:02:11] was rejected despised and by man amen he
[1:02:14] came to his own and his own received him
[1:02:16] not praise the Lord but he suffered
[1:02:20] anyway for us let us go therefore uh go
[1:02:25] forth there For unto him without the
[1:02:27] camp bearing his reproach for here we
[1:02:31] have no continuing City but we seek one
[1:02:34] that is to come friend we're in a dire
[1:02:37] need in this world today this world this
[1:02:40] Cosmos is about to yield itself over to
[1:02:43] a purification it's about to yield
[1:02:45] itself over to a Perfection it's about
[1:02:48] to yield itself over to the godliness
[1:02:51] that God had intended it to be when he
[1:02:54] created it to begin with when when he
[1:02:56] put Adam here and all the animals boty
[1:02:58] life animal life when God put it there
[1:03:00] and set it in the Perfection that it was
[1:03:02] friend let me tell you it's about to get
[1:03:04] back to that place again and we're in

[1:03:17] we're at a time where the bride is about
[1:03:19] to take a body change and go home to be
[1:03:21] with the Lord when Micah sang that song
[1:03:23] again it just they it it just so
[1:03:26] solidified and joy The Joy just came in
[1:03:29] my heart to realize the words of that
[1:03:32] song and how brother Terry tinwell was
[1:03:33] so inspired to sing that amen that any
[1:03:37] moment we'll see our loved ones appear
[1:03:39] before us those that have gone on before
[1:03:41] and I've got so many that I want to see

[1:03:56] and and pray and uh and and I open my
[1:04:01] eyes and just expect them to just be
[1:04:03] standing here right amen I guess it's
[1:04:06] probably different when you're in church
[1:04:07] and maybe at home or something but it's
[1:04:10] just different when I'm here amen and
[1:04:12] when I'm praying and I open my eyes I
[1:04:14] just I I think Lord just any moment
[1:04:16] they're going to appear and they're
[1:04:18] going to be here amen and I I just I
[1:04:21] could just feel them so close and
[1:04:22] brother Ram said they're only as far
[1:04:24] away as you put them amen but I've got
[1:04:26] so many that I'm looking forward to
[1:04:27] seeing one day but this world is about
[1:04:29] to give over to it amen the the the
[1:04:32] atmospheres are going to explode
[1:04:33] everything is going to take over this
[1:04:35] world is this country is uh is is done
[1:04:41] it's gone yes amen I looked up some some
[1:04:44] statistics I didn't really want to get
[1:04:46] into statistics today because I just
[1:04:48] wanted to be sort of an Evangelistic
[1:04:50] message but uh I looked up some
[1:04:52] statistics and found out that we are
[1:04:56] approximately $6 trillion in the whole
[1:05:00] now what that means is this country now
[1:05:03] we're
[1:05:05] 36 uh 36 yeah has anybody ever pulled up
[1:05:08] on your phone the national debt uh uh
[1:05:12] not calendar but counter yeah it's just
[1:05:16] it's
[1:05:17] just the
[1:05:19] $100,000 number is just flipping like
[1:05:22] this not the dollar not the cents the
[1:05:26] $100,000 mark on the counter is flipping
[1:05:30] like this the 100,000 the 10 thou it uh
[1:05:34] the million dollar is just turning over
[1:05:36] it it it's our debt is going that
[1:05:39] increasing that fast you know our debt
[1:05:42] has increased from from 1990 our debt
[1:05:46] was $3
[1:05:47] trillion now our debt basically through
[1:05:51] 2004 is 3 almost $36 trillion we've gone
[1:05:57] $33 trillion more in debt since
[1:06:01] 1990 Amen in eight years I believe now
[1:06:07] it's it's gone back and forth a little
[1:06:09] bit but it's not going back and forth
[1:06:10] now especially after Co this country we
[1:06:13] just uh I I think that the inventors of
[1:06:18] the printing press were happy or maybe
[1:06:21] rolling over their graves I'm not sure
[1:06:23] and how much money this country was
[1:06:25] printing to pass out to people amen
[1:06:27] which is one of the things that people
[1:06:29] have traded themselves they traded as we
[1:06:31] talked about last week the peace the
[1:06:33] love and joy theyve traded hard work for
[1:06:35] a handout yeah amen just just printing
[1:06:39] money over and over we've gone 36 to 30
[1:06:42] we gone 33 trillion doll now about eight
[1:06:45] years ago this country had got to the
[1:06:48] place that for the first time it crossed
[1:06:50] over to where our GDP or our gross
[1:06:53] domestic product is is is less than our
[1:06:57] debt right less now it's gone back and
[1:07:00] forth a couple of years since then but
[1:07:02] after Co it's just done this and right
[1:07:05] now we are I think it's five or six
[1:07:08] trillion dollar our debt is $6 trillion
[1:07:13] dollar more than our gross national
[1:07:15] product which means we could take every
[1:07:19] single penny that is collected in this
[1:07:23] country from every means and everybody
[1:07:26] for one whole year and we still couldn't
[1:07:29] pay off the national debt right we'd
[1:07:31] still be $6 trillion short if that's not
[1:07:34] bankrupt I don't know what is Right amen
[1:07:37] if that's not if that's not down the to
[1:07:40] tubes down the toilet I don't know what
[1:07:42] is I mean this country's finished and
[1:07:44] she's the best one out there I guess as
[1:07:46] far as that's concerned still amen but
[1:07:50] she's finished it's done I there's just
[1:07:53] no Redemption for it they keep talking
[1:07:56] about cutting down spending we now got
[1:07:58] somebody coming in a couple guys that's
[1:08:01] going to come in and they're going to
[1:08:02] cut the government
[1:08:04] waste uh in my
[1:08:07] opinion the government is a
[1:08:11] waste I think the about the only way
[1:08:13] anymore it seems like to cut the
[1:08:15] government waste is to cut the
[1:08:17] government uh it's just just seems like
[1:08:19] it's tall waste they spend tens of
[1:08:22] thousands of dollars to decide whether
[1:08:24] or not a shrimp uh is happier after
[1:08:28] having alcohol or not or or some kind of
[1:08:32] a mouse how how fast uh a a mouse or or
[1:08:37] or tree gender I forgot how much money
[1:08:41] this country spent on people trying to
[1:08:43] figure out tree
[1:08:45] genders is it a male is it a female is
[1:08:48] it something in between is it something
[1:08:50] we've never heard
[1:08:51] of thousands tens of thousands hundreds
[1:08:54] of thousands millions of dollars been on
[1:08:56] crazy stuff yes but yet our we're $6
[1:09:01] trillion doll in the hole as far as the
[1:09:04] the difference between our debt and our
[1:09:06] gross domestic product she's just it's
[1:09:09] just done it's finished amen they're
[1:09:12] they're talking about being able to
[1:09:13] balance the budget we don't need to
[1:09:15] balance the budget we need to cut the
[1:09:17] budget U it it just it's just to the
[1:09:21] place that it's just it's just done and
[1:09:23] it's not going to happen amen
[1:09:26] it doesn't matter what you do I mean
[1:09:27] there might be a few things they come up
[1:09:29] and they cut a couple things out and say
[1:09:31] well you know that's just silly that's
[1:09:32] just crazy and the Congress comes okay
[1:09:34] yeah we'll just cut that but there's so
[1:09:36] much of it that those crooked
[1:09:39] politicians are tied to it's just it's
[1:09:41] not going to make any difference amen
[1:09:44] it's not going to make any difference at
[1:09:45] all but this country's gone morals you
[1:09:48] can forget the morals we talked about
[1:09:50] that last week Amen to a certain degree
[1:09:53] morals are gone the morals of this
[1:09:55] country are just finished yes I you see
[1:09:57] the way people act and the way people
[1:09:59] talk the way people dress the way people
[1:10:01] live and the things that they do uh it
[1:10:04] it it's just it's to the point that it
[1:10:08] that the cosmos I'm not saying any
[1:10:11] particular human but the cosmos world
[1:10:14] order has become
[1:10:18] irredeemable it is not redeemable that's
[1:10:20] why God's going to destroy it that's why
[1:10:23] God's going to burn it over that's why
[1:10:25] God is going to uh uh send it uh uh uh
[1:10:30] in a fiery furnace and burn it all
[1:10:33] because it's got to be burned the only
[1:10:34] way to purify something is to burn it
[1:10:36] now what is the solution solution we
[1:10:38] have we know because we got we we have
[1:10:41] we no we have no continuing City
[1:10:44] here and remember everything pretty much
[1:10:47] everything that we talked about last
[1:10:51] week is leaning
[1:10:53] towards the prosperity of this nation
[1:10:57] and the goodness of this nation or the
[1:10:59] continuing of this nation amen the or or
[1:11:03] the world when they trade the peace and
[1:11:05] they trade the joy and they trade the
[1:11:07] longsuffering and the meekness and
[1:11:08] gentleness and all and Faith for and the
[1:11:12] joy the fruits of the spirit for all the
[1:11:14] other things to try to replace God

[1:11:26] sand it will not hold yes when the real
[1:11:30] Trouble Comes when the real waves when
[1:11:33] the real uh tumultuous weather comes
[1:11:36] along it'll destroy it it cannot stand
[1:11:39] you cannot build your house on a sinking
[1:11:43] sand you can't build it on how good your
[1:11:45] job is or your income or your your
[1:11:48] finances or your portfolio or your uh
[1:11:51] assets you can't build it on that amen

[1:11:57] into this world and it is absolutely
[1:11:59] sure you can n nothing out right amen
[1:12:02] I've made I've heard the statement many
[1:12:03] many years ago I've said it several
[1:12:05] times myself I've never seen a hearse
[1:12:07] pulling a U-Haul right amen why because
[1:12:11] they're not and even if they did all
[1:12:13] they could do is put it in that hole
[1:12:15] with that body right but that that stuff
[1:12:18] is not going with that person right amen
[1:12:20] absolutely all you take is what you send
[1:12:23] before you amen hence this scripture the
[1:12:27] one that I had on my heart
[1:12:30] Matthew
[1:12:31] um let's see here in in St
[1:12:34] Matthew the sixth
[1:12:39] verse

[1:12:44] sorry uh let's
[1:12:49] see uh let's start with verse 19 let's

[1:12:53] 19 Le lay not up for yourselves
[1:12:57] Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust
[1:13:00] do corrupt and where thieves break
[1:13:02] through and steal but lay up for
[1:13:05] yourselves Treasures in Heaven where
[1:13:07] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[1:13:10] where thieves do not break through nor
[1:13:12] steal amen that's the solution all that
[1:13:16] we have all that we take with us we send
[1:13:18] before us amen amen did we sin before
[1:13:22] for where your treasure is there will
[1:13:25] your heart be also amen amen that's
[1:13:28] where that's where our life is we store
[1:13:31] up Treasures in Heaven amen not here on
[1:13:34] Earth praise the Lord nothing wrong with
[1:13:37] having if the Lord were to t a a a
[1:13:41] retirement plan finances to be able to
[1:13:43] live on that kind of thing but not not
[1:13:48] accumulations of Huges amounts of
[1:13:51] wealth what's the point of that I I I
[1:13:54] was looking look got a picture the other
[1:13:56] day of uh and it's a message church it's
[1:13:59] just a very fine great big church nice
[1:14:02] huge platform and instruments and huge
[1:14:05] big pull pit and this and and the
[1:14:07] pictures and all it's just a just a hug
[1:14:10] huge beautiful big
[1:14:12] church and I start to think you know
[1:14:14] there's more of those in this message
[1:14:16] going up around the country around this
[1:14:18] country I know of now around the world I
[1:14:20] don't know but around this country I see
[1:14:22] this church and these people and then
[1:14:25] and everybody they seem like they want
[1:14:26] to get all this money and they want to
[1:14:27] build these nice big huge buildings and
[1:14:30] and all and I thought for how many
[1:14:33] years whenever the brandham Tabernacle
[1:14:36] was
[1:14:37] built God gave brother brandham that
[1:14:39] land god allowed him to lay that
[1:14:42] Cornerstone and that church got built
[1:14:45] amen they added to it a little bit but
[1:14:48] he did did he ever and he could have
[1:14:52] brother bam of any of them could have
[1:14:56] have taken the millions of dollars that
[1:14:58] was offered to him and gone off
[1:15:00] somewhere and but a huge piece of land
[1:15:02] bought him a big huge Place big huge to
[1:15:05] accommodate all the people that come in
[1:15:07] to to Jeffersonville big huge church and
[1:15:10] all the everything did he do
[1:15:12] it I remember one brother Ram sitting at
[1:15:15] his desk one time he talks tells the
[1:15:17] story he's sitting in his desk and story
[1:15:20] comes up about o Roberts and all this
[1:15:22] great the college and all this money and
[1:15:26] all these big huge fine churches and
[1:15:28] Billy Graham the different ones and
[1:15:30] ministers and you know they have all
[1:15:32] these all this huge finery and all these
[1:15:34] big churches and all this great stuff
[1:15:37] and brother Ram gets dis gets depressed
[1:15:40] he says Lord why can't I have something
[1:15:43] like that why have I been allotted to to
[1:15:46] those things God says step
[1:15:49] outside and brother random goes He steps
[1:15:52] and he goes out opens the door goes out
[1:15:55] side he says Now look up he said he
[1:15:57] looks up and he says all of that is
[1:16:00] yours amen you don't need all this other
[1:16:04] praise the Lord I I'm and I'm not
[1:16:07] criticizing the churches they do what
[1:16:09] they want that's fine amen they need a
[1:16:12] big church they have big congregation
[1:16:14] and whatever they do that's fine amen
[1:16:16] but you know brother Brown never did it
[1:16:18] right and if anybody brother bandam
[1:16:20] could have done it right brother
[1:16:22] brandham was offered enough money to to
[1:16:25] have done it how many times over yeah
[1:16:28] offered a million dollars offered a
[1:16:29] million and half dollars he could have
[1:16:31] taken $2.5 millionar in
[1:16:34] 1960 yeah you imagine what kind of thing
[1:16:36] he uh property he could have bought in
[1:16:38] church he could have built with that
[1:16:40] kind of money right but he didn't do
[1:16:43] it why I don't know maybe we can ask him
[1:16:47] one
[1:16:48] day but he could have but yet people set
[1:16:52] they set for the longest time with no
[1:16:54] air

[1:17:54] place
[1:17:55] place but he didn't do it why I don't

[1:22:58] to go praise the Lord Abraham is the one
[1:23:03] that deemed him the almighty God yes and

[1:23:39] glimpse of it he's G give me a little
[1:23:42] Snippets to know what it's like amen but
[1:23:46] in my heart it's longing to go to that
[1:23:48] place it's longing to go out of this
[1:23:52] Cosmos out of this world out of the
[1:23:54] corruption of this world Amen unless you
[1:23:59] spend and it was different for me but
[1:24:03] now
[1:24:05] especially uh I I I guess it depends on
[1:24:08] who you are what you
[1:24:10] do I was I would say I was a little more
[1:24:13] guarded uh when I worked with brother
[1:24:16] Roger and we did electric work we went
[1:24:19] to people's houses businesses and stuff
[1:24:21] like that but I worked with him
[1:24:24] a Believer a Christian a godly man I
[1:24:29] worked with him amen amen you don't
[1:24:33] realize and I guess you don't realize
[1:24:36] how bad things really are uh uh until
[1:24:40] you're in the middle of it and when God
[1:24:43] throws you in the middle of it you think
[1:24:45] my this is just a rotting cess of
[1:24:50] Filth humanity is just a rotting cess of
[1:24:55] Filth
[1:24:58] Humanity I remember going into my
[1:25:00] mom's uh place where she there it's the
[1:25:03] end of her life
[1:25:05] and
[1:25:07] Humanity please don't get me wrong but
[1:25:10] humanity is disgusting yeah the filth
[1:25:14] and nastiness of the human and the human
[1:25:17] body is
[1:25:20] disgusting it
[1:25:22] stinks it rots I go through the building
[1:25:26] and you can literally smell the
[1:25:29] rot of the humanity right but yet we
[1:25:33] think so much of this nasty thing amen
[1:25:37] and and not not that you shouldn't
[1:25:39] shower not that you shouldn't groom not
[1:25:42] that you shouldn't haircut or whatever

[1:25:48] simply a rotting cess pool of Filth but
[1:25:51] the but in getting out more into the
[1:25:54] world world now with this job that I'm
[1:25:55] on now it's uh the the the
[1:26:01] immorality sin is it just slaps you
[1:26:06] right in the face and the thing that I
[1:26:09] guess for me that
[1:26:11] probably uh hits me the hardest is
[1:26:15] people don't seem to care yeah and the
[1:26:19] reason they don't seem to care is
[1:26:21] because they're in Leia
[1:26:24] they're poor miserable blind wretched
[1:26:26] naked and don't know it am they don't
[1:26:30] know it amen and if you don't know
[1:26:33] you're not going to care amen amen if
[1:26:36] you don't realize you're lost you're not
[1:26:38] going to try to be found right if you
[1:26:41] know if you don't know you're wrong
[1:26:43] you're not going to try to get right
[1:26:45] right right but when you know and when
[1:26:48] there's something in you that says this
[1:26:50] is not right you say God then show show
[1:26:54] me what is right because I Want to Be
[1:26:56] Right amen I don't want to be wrong yes

[1:27:02] has no hope and no future and no
[1:27:05] continuing City I want to be in that one
[1:27:08] I want to look for that one I want to go
[1:27:10] to that one that Abraham was talking
[1:27:12] about here he went by faith not knowing
[1:27:16] where he went he went anyway by faith he
[1:27:21] sojourned in the land of promise as in a
[1:27:24] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[1:27:26] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him
[1:27:29] of the same promise for he looked
[1:27:32] hallelujah what are we looking for today

[1:27:39] I'm looking for my next paycheck I'm
[1:27:42] looking toward my next vacation I'm
[1:27:45] looking for nothing wrong with planning
[1:27:47] nothing wrong with making a living we
[1:27:49] should all do that amen we we are not it
[1:27:53] is a distress
[1:27:54] for a person to call themselves a
[1:27:57] Christian and look for a handout from
[1:28:00] the government and not
[1:28:02] work you've got the ability now and look
[1:28:08] look I I feel like I got to say this I
[1:28:10] don't want me I don't want myself to be
[1:28:12] misunderstood because we have several
[1:28:14] people in here under Social Security
[1:28:17] Social Security is not a handout you
[1:28:20] understand that the government wants to
[1:28:22] try to convince you now now that it's an
[1:28:25] entitlement it is not I think I've said
[1:28:28] this before a few weeks ago CU this just
[1:28:30] burns me I mean as much as anything the
[1:28:33] government this just burns me up
[1:28:35] especially the older I'm getting amen
[1:28:37] I've been giving the government
[1:28:39] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[1:28:41] my dollars over 40 years with the
[1:28:45] promise that they were going to give it
[1:28:47] back to me when I retire amen and they
[1:28:51] call that an entitlement that's not an
[1:28:53] entitlement
[1:28:54] that is you force me to give you my
[1:28:57] money for you to hold and give back to
[1:29:01] me when I need
[1:29:03] it amen that's what Social Security is
[1:29:05] supposed to be what do they do they take
[1:29:07] your money and they spend it on trying
[1:29:09] to find out what the gender of a tree
[1:29:13] is amen amen whether a rat can run
[1:29:17] faster on a conveyor when he's drunk or
[1:29:21] High I mean crazy stuff they take your
[1:29:24] money to do it and then they come around
[1:29:26] and say well now we don't have enough
[1:29:28] money to pay you
[1:29:29] all Social Security is going bankrupt
[1:29:32] bankrupt my foot it shouldn't be going
[1:29:35] bankrupt it's my money
[1:29:37] right that's what it's supposed to be so
[1:29:41] it's not an
[1:29:42] entitlement it it is not uh a gift a
[1:29:47] handout it is your money that they were
[1:29:50] supposed to be obligated to give back to
[1:29:52] you right and of course they never give
[1:29:55] it back to you based on the increment
[1:29:58] increase of what the inflation is going
[1:30:00] up amen they never do that so all the
[1:30:03] time you're you're you're going further
[1:30:06] and further in the hole but there's a
[1:30:08] lot of people out there who are able to
[1:30:11] work and can work and aren't to
[1:30:12] retirement age that just expect a
[1:30:14] handout from the government and they
[1:30:17] give it to
[1:30:19] them it's wrong I'm sorry that shouldn't
[1:30:23] happen right amen but we're living in a
[1:30:26] non-continuing
[1:30:28] city we are looking for a city we're
[1:30:33] looking not to our next
[1:30:35] paycheck not to our next car purchase

[1:31:30] original owner God Amen but he took over
[1:31:32] this Cosmos this world now we're looking
[1:31:35] for a city whose
[1:31:38] foundations amen the the the foundation
[1:31:42] of the building is a rock not sand that
[1:31:46] rock is Christ we're looking for that
[1:31:48] Foundation whose Builder and maker is
[1:31:50] God that will stand the test of time and
[1:31:54] and all the corruption everything else
[1:31:55] that comes along amen he by he by faith
[1:31:59] went looking for that
[1:32:01] City amen we're
[1:32:04] lost this country is lost this world is
[1:32:07] lost amen people live with most people
[1:32:12] live with no no regard for
[1:32:16] tomorrow politicians will spend the
[1:32:19] money and people will just spend the
[1:32:22] money without regard of what the next
[1:32:24] generation's going to do or the Next
[1:32:27] Generation or the next you think in 1990
[1:32:30] who was President in
[1:32:33] 1990 Bill Clinton I can't remember
[1:32:36] anyway in
[1:32:38] 1990 you think of 1990 that they thought
[1:32:41] in 2024 the debt would have grown by $33
[1:32:46] trillion you think all through those
[1:32:49] years from that time till now that they
[1:32:51] would have had any concern of about what
[1:32:54] my life was going to be like or what
[1:32:56] debt my grandson and granddaughter were
[1:32:59] going to be saddled
[1:33:01] with don't
[1:33:03] matter they don't live that they there's
[1:33:06] no
[1:33:09] regard but praise the
[1:33:12] lord we are looking for a city whose
[1:33:15] Builder maker is God we're looking for a
[1:33:18] city that's
[1:33:19] Eternal amen does not falter does not
[1:33:22] fail perfect holy righteous let me read
[1:33:26] a couple of more verses of scripture
[1:33:28] here I'll will
[1:33:29] close in uh re in in Revelation we know
[1:33:33] it talks about the new city we went
[1:33:34] through the new city yes
[1:33:38] amen but um I'll skip that let's go to
[1:33:42] Second
[1:33:48] Peter second Peter chapter 3 verse1
[1:33:54] now some people may look at this and
[1:33:55] think man that is such a dismal message
[1:33:58] couldn't you give a more encouraging
[1:34:00] message I can't think of any more
[1:34:01] encouraging message than the
[1:34:04] understanding that we're not dependent
[1:34:05] on this Cosmos World our faith and our
[1:34:09] trust is looking to a city whose Builder
[1:34:11] maker is God a thing that is not in that
[1:34:14] that we're dependent on here we're
[1:34:16] dependent on God and everything about
[1:34:18] God and going to a place that God has
[1:34:20] already prepared for us yes amen I don't
[1:34:24] know of any other more encouraging thing
[1:34:25] to say that's what that's what our whole
[1:34:28] future is about is living in a place
[1:34:31] that is not corrupt amen it is not
[1:34:33] sinful it is not uh a a r a rotting sesp
[1:34:38] of
[1:34:40] Fil A place that's
[1:34:44] perfect second Peter 3:1 this Second
[1:34:47] Epistle beloved I now write unto you in
[1:34:49] both which I stir up your pure Minds by
[1:34:51] the way of remembrance that you may be
[1:34:54] mindful of The Words which were spoken
[1:34:55] before by the holy prophets and the
[1:34:58] Commandment of us the Apostles of the
[1:34:59] Lord and Savior knowing this first that
[1:35:02] have that there shall come in the last
[1:35:04] days scoffers we talked about the last
[1:35:06] days last week this is any more last
[1:35:08] days amen this the last moment's last
[1:35:11] second
[1:35:12] scoffers walking after their own lust
[1:35:15] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:35:18] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:35:20] all things continue as they were from
[1:35:22] the beginning of creation makes me think
[1:35:24] about those
[1:35:26] the the thing that that people will
[1:35:29] scoff against that will make fun of or
[1:35:32] just turn away from I've never had
[1:35:35] anybody let's just say as as much as uh
[1:35:39] some of the guys on the team can cuss or
[1:35:41] cuss BR drink and um I never they have
[1:35:46] never mocked or made fun of me or what I
[1:35:48] believe they've never put me down for it
[1:35:51] at least not to my face they've never
[1:35:53] put me down for it they've never
[1:35:54] ridiculed it or anything like that but
[1:35:57] yet they go on living their lives like
[1:36:00] uh that there's no regard for that I
[1:36:03] even T yesterday flying home we were at
[1:36:06] the airport and the guy I told you about
[1:36:09] Doug super guy I mean uh he's just a
[1:36:14] great do anything for you if I asked him
[1:36:17] to come do something for you at your
[1:36:18] house or in this church he'd do it
[1:36:20] without
[1:36:22] hesitation absolutely he said yeah what
[1:36:24] what do you need he would he's that kind
[1:36:27] of guy well I I got a cup of coffee at
[1:36:30] the airport and he's looking for a bar
[1:36:33] cuz he's got to have a
[1:36:35] drink and he gets a beer and and he gets
[1:36:38] in a little shot of something I don't
[1:36:40] know what it is and he drinks it all
[1:36:42] down and we finally walk over to the
[1:36:44] gate we get there a couple hours early
[1:36:45] finally go over walk over the gate and
[1:36:47] he said oh yeah there's there's this
[1:36:49] place here I said well you could have
[1:36:50] gone there instead he said no or in
[1:36:52] addition to
[1:36:54] I thought Doug you got to have another
[1:36:56] beard I said ' well depends on your
[1:36:59] money and your liver yeah and he said
[1:37:03] well the only thing I'm concerned about
[1:37:04] is the first
[1:37:05] part I said you don't care anything
[1:37:07] about your
[1:37:09] liver it's just the dollar that you care
[1:37:12] about it's not not even your liver oh my
[1:37:15] liver is fine really now he knows see he
[1:37:18] knows I told you before kind of has a
[1:37:21] Death Wish really um
[1:37:24] I mean if it if the job called for
[1:37:27] walking on a tight RPP he would do it
[1:37:30] even if 20 foot above the ground he'd
[1:37:32] probably do it he's just he does the
[1:37:35] sketchy
[1:37:36] stuff A lot of times now which is good
[1:37:39] because I used to do a lot of sketchy
[1:37:40] stuff uh one guy called me spider monkey
[1:37:43] one time but anyway he would he that's
[1:37:45] just what he do just no regard but I
[1:37:47] when he said that I'm thinking Doug
[1:37:49] really you you cared more about the
[1:37:52] dollar in your pocket than the Del in
[1:37:53] your body that keeps you alive but
[1:37:56] that's the mentality I think that's the
[1:37:58] mentality with a lot of people amen
[1:38:01] don't just there's no regard
[1:38:05] probably is her God and their God don't
[1:38:08] know not worried about it I'm just going
[1:38:10] to live my life it's that kind of thing
[1:38:12] you know let it be what it's going to be
[1:38:14] I go to hell I go to hell a lot of
[1:38:16] people say they think hell's going to be
[1:38:18] a lot more
[1:38:20] fun that's just the way the mentality of
[1:38:24] people that they think today amen and
[1:38:27] that's why they're like this scoffers
[1:38:30] well where is he you you people keep
[1:38:32] preaching and talking about it all this
[1:38:33] time you say you're a Christian you live
[1:38:35] like this won't even take a drink or
[1:38:36] something noen I think I told y'all one
[1:38:39] time uh we were in Salt Lake City and we
[1:38:44] had a day that we took they called team
[1:38:46] building and they were we were found a
[1:38:48] place they started throwing the hatchets
[1:38:49] you ever done that at a Target and all
[1:38:52] the guys were throwing in bang us
[1:38:53] falling off and I throw it I don't you
[1:38:55] know I've never done it before I just
[1:38:57] grabbed it and threw it and it's stuck
[1:38:59] right in the center and they're like man
[1:39:01] you can do anything and the and Brian
[1:39:05] the new manager R out said you anything
[1:39:06] but
[1:39:07] C like no I can I just choose not to I'm
[1:39:12] I'm smart enough not to use the six
[1:39:13] filthy words or the Dozen filthy I'm
[1:39:16] smart enough to use other words without
[1:39:17] having to use those words I didn't say
[1:39:19] that part anyway uh then they but is it
[1:39:23] was I didn't take it as a scoffing
[1:39:25] though but that's the way they think you
[1:39:27] know U there's nothing to that right
[1:39:31] let's continue on though for this they
[1:39:34] willingly are ignorant of that by the
[1:39:38] word of God the heavens were of old and
[1:39:40] the Earth standing out of the water and
[1:39:41] in the water whereby the world that was
[1:39:44] being overflowed with water perished but
[1:39:47] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[1:39:48] by the same are kept in store preserved
[1:39:51] uh reserved unto fire against that day
[1:39:53] of judgment and predition of ungodly man
[1:39:55] look at what we're looking at friends we
[1:39:57] know California is going to sink but
[1:39:59] this nation's going to burn over border
[1:40:00] to border Coast to Coast amen we know
[1:40:03] that prophecy has already gone
[1:40:05] out is that's a good start I don't I
[1:40:09] don't know but uh but the bride's going
[1:40:11] to be gone by the time that in my
[1:40:12] opinion it's going to before that
[1:40:14] happens but beloved be not ignorant of
[1:40:16] this one thing that one day is with the
[1:40:17] Lord is thousand years and thousand
[1:40:19] years is one day the Lord is not slack
[1:40:21] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:40:24] slackness but is longsuffering to us
[1:40:26] we're not willing that any should perish
[1:40:28] but that all should come to repentance
[1:40:30] and God I try to help keep that in my
[1:40:32] heart amen and and when and when I said
[1:40:35] what I said about the people in
[1:40:36] California that's exactly the attitude I
[1:40:39] want to have right amen I want every I
[1:40:42] wish every human drawing breath would
[1:40:45] come to Christ in Repentance amen I do
[1:40:49] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[1:40:51] thief in the night in the which the
[1:40:52] heaven shall pass pass away with a great
[1:40:54] noise the elements shall melt with
[1:40:55] fervent heat the Earth also and the
[1:40:57] works there The Works that are therein
[1:41:00] shall be burned up seeing that the all
[1:41:02] these things shall be dissolved what
[1:41:04] manner of person ought ye to be in all
[1:41:08] holy conversation and godliness looking
[1:41:11] for and hastening unto the coming of the
[1:41:13] day of God wherein the heavens being on
[1:41:15] fire shall be dissolved in the elements
[1:41:17] shall melt with fent heat nevertheless
[1:41:19] we according to his promise look for H
[1:41:22] Allelujah
[1:41:23] amen we are looking for excuse me a new
[1:41:28] heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth
[1:41:30] righteousness wherefore beloved seeing
[1:41:32] that ye look for such things be diligent
[1:41:35] that you be that you may be found in of
[1:41:38] him in peace without spot and blameless
[1:41:42] amen praise the Lord and that's exactly
[1:41:45] the reason that Jesus Christ took our
[1:41:47] place at Calvary so he could take our
[1:41:50] place so that we could take his yes so
[1:41:53] that we could be without robed in his
[1:41:56] righteousness without a spot wrinkle or
[1:41:59] blemish amen that's that's the reason
[1:42:02] that he came to do that for us yes the
[1:42:05] reason we can take that position people
[1:42:07] think oh you go too far I think you know
[1:42:09] a lot of times we just don't go far
[1:42:11] enough in realizing who we are yes Jesus
[1:42:15] Christ God Of Heaven and Earth took my
[1:42:17] place so I could take his amen and be
[1:42:22] robed in his
[1:42:24] righteousness oh
[1:42:26] my that that is not conjecture that that
[1:42:30] is not uh uh uh an allegory that that is
