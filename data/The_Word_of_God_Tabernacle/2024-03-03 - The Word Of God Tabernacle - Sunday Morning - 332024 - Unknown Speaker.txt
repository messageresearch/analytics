no other choice right praise the Lord thank you Jesus he's mindful amen amen He Loves Us Praise the Lord let's stand to our feet if we could going to go to the scripture now St Matthew 11 uh we're we are um on God and simplicity part 13 Bride versus Church part four amen so begin the same place we have the last 12 times uh Matthew 11: 25 I want to read that verse of scripture uh before we move on Amen amen Matthew 1125 amen before we read let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus so very thankful father of your grace your mercy your love the blessings you give Lord you're always with us you never leave us or forsake us and God it's not just a platitude it's not just a something that we say Lord we know it because we feel it and we recognize it and it's been evident in our lives so many times Lord and God it just it just to know what your word says the promise of your word believing that word trusting you in that word God and it has never failed father because it is impossible for it to fail because it is you and you are God and you never change Lord we change society changes people changes ways changes people think of better things they discover greater things in science or medicine Lord but you never change you're still here God to do the same the exceeding abundantly above all that could ever ask or think Lord and we believe God and trust you for that truth of your word that continues to reveal itself to our heart and show us in there God what we would need to draw us closer to you and more like you and more in your image reflection of you Lord that's what we want to be in this earth in this time God is simple reflections of you that you God would live through us and show to this world that you are still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yes Lord manifest here in this place today the purpose Lord for this meeting we know God your word will not will not return void to accomplish it here today the purpose Lord that you have us here God in the and the reason we came Lord the desire that's on our hearts and just trusting you Lord to speak to us from this word once again we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hind or and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you and Praise You In All Things Lord we just trust and believe you move those that are needy today those aren't here those that are sick and body Lord those special prayer request things in our hearts we just trust you and believe for them God today we commit to you Lord now that we're ending part of the service may your blessing be upon it father speak through these lips the word should have us to hear Let It Be In accordance to your perfect will in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Matthew 11:25 and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes you could be seated if you'd like amen as I said uh this is God in Simplicity the 13th Part God in Simplicity part 13 is the subtitle of Bride versus church or bride and the church part four amen part four uh we've gone through the first first three parts have been quite poignant to me amen there been a been a blessing as a reminder uh to me uh and it's it meant a lot to me but part four now is we were looking at this yesterday I want to go to St John chapter 3 come to my heart something very U uh very striking when I was just a young boy uh when my parents were very I would say uh I would consider us devout Baptist um we uh we went to church that I can recall every Sunday for the for most of my the younger part of my life uh till my dad got to the place that he recognized it was something more uh wrote a letter to the Baptist Church and said take our name off of your role uh and so on so forth and uh and then we didn't go to church for a while and then the Lord showed him uh uh what we believe today and uh and then we and then my my parents were faithful to church every service not Sundays every Service uh for the most part within reason of course but uh but there was something that always stuck with me that when when we were in the Baptist Church and um when I went to Sunday school in the Baptist Church and the one thing that I remember the most uh being in the Baptist Church was John 3:16 uh the Baptist Church uh I don't mean this in a derogatory way I don't mean this to be uh slant on anybody or any church but they drilled this into you when you're a kid when you're a child they did us anyway uh maybe it's different where you go but in the South and the church uh uh and and again I don't mean that word to be a derogatory uh term because uh honestly we'd all we all should be familiar with the scripture but by the time I was probably five or six of my earliest Recollections I could quote uh John 3:16 from har uh and and mainly they get the credit for that so but let's go back and read John 3:16 let's let's start at the 15th verse though St John verse uh chapter 3 verse 15 uh and and and maybe just get a little deeper than than probably well absolutely what the Baptist Church took me uh and my family because we come to find out there's a little more depth to the word than just believing amen amen but now John 3:15 let's start reading there John 3:15 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen now now that belief we're going to get into a little bit deeper a little bit later but just to understand the scratching of the surface of of a common understanding of something as if you just believe in something a belief in something is something that that proves to you or you believe that it exists uh that's what belief is uh you believe something it means that you believe that it exists uh and when you read the scripture and of course and and I just have to say it the way it was when I was younger I may everybody maybe a little bit different depending on where you went to church where you grew up maybe the teaching was a little different but the the teaching that I received and from what I've seen a lot of people follow along the same guidelines that if you if you read this scripture just at face value and you just simply believe you're just simply believing that God is that's enough to Grant you eternal life but I'm sorry to inform people today but it takes a lot more than just believing that he exists the devil believes he exists in fact the devil knows he ex uh but we obviously know that the devil's not saved uh the devil's not going to be born again the devil's not going to come through the blood the brother the devil's never going to be your brother so uh but he believes amen so it takes us to the point to understand then exactly what is it that John is trying to get across it's not just something that's simply believing that something exists amen it's not just simply believing that something exists although a lot of people would try to maybe get you to believe that or try to get you to see it that way but it's it's more than just believing God exists amen let's continue to read I like I said I'll delve into that a little deeper a little bit later believ in the him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not now this this is some powerful teaching here really that uh uh wish we had gone into uh when I was younger but anyway for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world to judge the world which is exactly what the Jews thought was going to happen right they thought that Jesus their Messiah was going to come and wipe it all off and send us all to heaven and everything was going to be great but that's not why Jesus came he did not come to condemn the world much uh much against what a lot of people even still believe today amen that there's that there's supposed to be that Jesus came for the purpose of judging people that wasn't why he came right he came to save people yes he came that he could live and bleed and die and send back his life so that Humanity would have a shot at being able to go to heaven that they would be able to have a chance to make a Rapture that they would be able to be considered a child of God right he came to save the world not to condemn it amen in fact most of the time if you look at the word if you look at the scripture when Jesus came most the truth of it is anyone that is condemned condemns themselves Jesus doesn't condemn them they condemn themselves that word condemn is Judge basically uh to judge themselves so God did not send his son into the world to judge the world or condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he come to bring Salvation to us amen now there's a time that that lamb turns into a lion the the the sacrificial lamb to the judgmental lion but that wasn't the reason Jesus came right amen he came to save the world he that believeth on him is is not condemned now now how do you now how do you have the bride going into a Rapture or go going into a tribulation how do you have the bride going through tribulation when right here John Jesus in John's writing he that believeth on him is not condemned is not judged that's exactly the the purpose of the tribulation if the bride is not to be judged then how can you have her going through tribulation amen friends there's just so many scriptures that let us know what what is the truth of the word and the separation between the church and the bride right amen amen between the between the wise virgin and the foolish virgin which we've gone through look he that believeth on him is not condemned is not judged amen that's what happens when he gives us the Holy Spirit yes when we obey his word remember uh complete obedience to the word entitles you to the token what's that complete obedience repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ remission of the sin and you shall receive the Holy Ghost right the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the promise of the word obedience to that word entitles you to that Holy Spirit right obedience to it amen now now God looks down and says when when when the cleansing the burning out of the old nature takes place that's a judgment that burns out the old nature in you and he puts his own life in you that's approving to you it's approving to the world that God has accepted you a lot of people think baptism is salvation friends baptism out isn't salvation without the without the truth and reflection of God's word baptism is nothing more than taking a shower or a bath or going in a hot tub right amen amen true baptism has to have true repentance true repentance baptism in Jesus Christ name brings the Holy Spirit when God brings the holy spirit in you see when we're baptized we show to the world that we've accepted Jesus Christ and that's wonderful but what about his acceptance of you amen I can accept I can accept Elon Musk money all day it's mine but until he comes up and writes me a check you can forget it amen I can claim anything I want to claim but unless he comes and claims me my word is nothing right and I show the world that I accept him amen not a father not a son not a holy ghost not a bunch of titles but I accept him the Lord Jesus Christ and when I show to the world that I've accepted him the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior he shows the world that he's accepted me by putting his Spirit In Me Yes amen now I'm a new creature now I a new person now I've been born again now God is living through me now God is showing through me to the rest of the world that he is the same yesterday today and forever he is the same God now as he has always been through scripture he's not a dead God he's not a god of History he's a god of right now he's a god of right now because of me yes because of you you that's been born again it's because of you he's the god of right now because of us amen so the condemnation is over the judgment is over and we'll read a scripture in a minute sealing of that Spirit shows ownership amen we'll get to it uh here we'll read in just a minute let's finish this though for God sent not his son to the world to condemn the world 18th verse he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already they've done what judged themselves they've judged themselves they're condemned already they're judged already Why by their actions by their by their uh uh by their life they've already shown to through through their soul their Spirit their body they've shown they're condemned already they do it why not C God's done it because they've done it to themselves because they're unbelievers amen amen condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation this is the condemnation this is the Judgment the judgment is that light has come into the world but men would love uh but men love Darkness rather than light right yes they would rather walk in darkness than walk in light me and brother Tom was talking yesterday zinka was uh uh a little bit yesterday and and uh about the light and about the way people are today and how difficult it is to try to shed a little light in someone's in someone's pathway anymore um it it's taken me some time but I've made a little enro with my with my uh group that I work with now and I can talk to them about it a little bit you know at first it was just you know if it was just somebody off the street you can forget it right but now that I've gained their confidence they know me and they know know who I am and what kind of person I am I I'm able to speak to them now about these things but normally when you're out on the street or or something like it's very difficult to try to talk about the Lord people don't want to hear it either that or they think that and I've heard this plenty too that however they're living they're going to be okay you know as long as they're this side of Hitler they're going to be fine as long as there's this as long as they're on this side of murdering millions of people or eating people alive or something they're okay you know don't matter how they live or what they do it's going to be I'm going to make heaven anyway but if you don't obey God's word how do you think you're ever going to be pleasing to him if you're not pleasing to him how do you think he's ever going to take you to be with him right amen amen men that but that's the Judgment that's the condemnation that men people like Darkness rather than light they would rather have the darkness of the world than they would Jesus Christ the light of the world right they love Darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil right amen their deeds are even but they enjoy living that way they want to live that way H why because they haven't had a nature change right they haven't had a change they haven't been born again so of course their nature is to love the evil things I sitting here praying this morning think Lord where would I have been without you you know would I would I uh would I be dead right uh would I be the guy on the corner over here here begging for a dollar at the corner of Orland River what what what kind of life would I be would I spent my night in the in the wash down here under some little tarp or something on on a rock what kind of Life who would I be but I don't even want to think about that right amen but people today believe that they're right I I I truly believe that a lot of people feel like what they're doing is okay in a lot of ways uh you talk about the government things like that I think I think a lot of those people that even though our country is going down the toilet uh I think a lot of people they they actually think they're doing right right they I I believe somehow in their minds uh that that that they believe that they're okay you know and when I was living in the world I didn't see any different either I I I thought I was fine I I thought I would be okay before the Lord put his spirit in me and I I I thought everything was fine I was you know everything's going to be okay I'm a good person I'm a decent person I I haven't murdered anybody lately I I I haven't I haven't uh plundered or stolen or uh plowed over a parade of people I've been I've been a good boy I've been a good guy surely God will be a doesn't work that way right amen because the bottom line of it is is my soul still desired the things that were wrong the things that were evil the things that were evil what is what constitutes evil anything that is against Christ in his word amen is evil yes amen it's Antichrist if it's against him against his word is Antichrist and anything that's against him is evil praise the Lord so how do you know not to do evil know what his word says live by the scripture live by the word live by what Jesus and how Jesus told us to live amen amen and what was the first thing he said in St John 3 he told Nicodemus you must be born again amen praise the lord it's the only way it can happen only way it can happen is you must be born again Born Again wow that's that's a step or two Beyond just believing amen Jesus said you must be born again that's a good bit beyond just believing that Jesus is which we look John 3:15-16 believeth it's a lot more than just believing amen or just believing in his existence not trying to change the word I'm just trying to help us understand there's a deeper understanding to even what the word believe or believeth is than what we look at on the surface amen for everyone that doth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God right praise the Lord what we do we do for him amen we live for him we live for others of course we live for others we're staring heaven in the face we live for others we're living for him amen amen that's what his life was right amen if his life was living for others I should be the same way amen and when we live for him live for others we're living for him let's go over to Ephesians now Ephesians chapter 1 my point here is it there's more to it than just believing in the existence of God there's more to it than just believing in the existence of Jesus Christ amen there's a there's a holy consecrated righteous life of the Holy Ghost that follows that amen praise the Lord let's look at this now uh Ephesians chapter 1 verse 12 Ephesians 1:12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ trusted have faith have confidence hope in Jesus Christ in whom ye also trusted had faith in belief in uh trust after after after amen amen after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom Christ in whom also after amen not when after that ye believed ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise right the belief in God the belief in Christ the belief in the word is just what brings you it's the vehicle that leads you to where you need to go to be able to be born again to receive the holy spirit amen after that ye believe amen now the word does not contradict itself you have to understand the contradiction or the truth of God's word to alleviate the contradiction it doesn't say one thing one place and something else some other place amen that's why by Revelation it gets you to believing that once you believe in Christ full obedience entitles you to the Holy Spirit the token after that you believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise remember that seal we talked about a few months back I can't remember when that seal remember that seal denotes one of the reasons of that seal is it denotes ownership so when God put his spirit in you he showed to the world that he's accepted you as as one of his he sealed you with the Holy Spirit of promise that Holy Spirit itself is literally a seal it seals God in and seals the devil out it is also a seal of ownership amen it shows ownership that that seal proves that you belong to God you don't belong to the devil no matter how much the devil try to convince you of it you do not belong to the devil you belong to Jesus Christ that seal proves it who are you I'm a Child of God yes I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I'm a I'm I'm a born I'm more than just a believer I'm a born again believer amen praise the Lord sealed that ownership proves that you belong to God that seal with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit itself is the seal now that is 14th verse that is which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession the earnest of our inheritance what is our inheritance Christ the word all that comes with that you say well my inheritance is is heaven and and and and the the the the H the the house and the uh on in the New Jerusalem or my inheritance is seeing all my loved ones again every bit of what God blessings to you funnels right down to one thing and that's Christ right amen amen the promise of your inheritance is Christ the word Jesus Christ to you the earnest is a down payment the holy spirit is a down payment it's a down payment of your inheritance so the Holy Spirit comes to you as a temporal gift amen you know what that means a temporal gift is a gift that God gives you for a period of time amen amen it's for us until we leave this place amen the Holy Spirit comes in us until we leave here amen amen it's our ticket it's our token yes amen you know what happens when I go on on a flight every other week they give me a ticket nowadays it's on my phone but sometimes I I'll go up and give my license and without asking they'll print me a paper ticket I have a paper I'll get a paper ticket most of the time it's on my phone but I get a paper ticket like the lady did last week she give me a paper ticket didn't ask for it but that ticket entitles me to get on the plane right I can go through security I can go through the gate I can get on the plane because I have the ticket because I have a seal of ownership that proves that I have I have a legal right to get on this plane that's that's our agreement between the airline and myself is that I paid the fair and you gave me the ticket and this proves that I am one of them praise the Lord uh mine even gives me the seat that I'm supposed to sit in but I have a ride on the plane amen far as the Good Ship of Zion I don't care what what seat I have as long as I'm on it uh but uh that ticket tells me now when I use that ticket and I get on the plane I go to my destination when I get to my destination what used to I have the ticket anymore I don't need the plane ticket anymore put it through a Sher throw it to garbage whatever I can do whatever I want to with it cuz it's irrelevant anymore I don't need the ticket anymore I've gotten to my Destin Nation the holy spirit is an Earnest it's a down payment of The Inheritance but it is until now let's finish the scripture to help back up what I just said with my ticket story until the Redemption of the purchased possession who's the purchased possession I am amen you are yes you're the purchase you're the one that Jesus came to save you're the Fulfillment of St John uh 3:16 he came uh 3:17 he came in the world to save you you are the one who was bought by with a price by the blood of Jesus Christ you are that purchased possession the earnest night gives us the Holy Ghost as an Earnest as a down payment amen of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession now if you go by a house you give earnest money earnest money allows you the opportunity to purchase the house it it gives you a deed it gives you a uh the keys to the door and you can go and you can occupy that house but that house isn't yours you can occupy it you can live in it you can enjoy all the benefits of that beautiful house but it's not yours until the price is fully paid amen when the price is fully paid of course in this country nobody really ever homs anything because you don't pay your taxes they're going to take it anyway but theoretically it's supposed to be yours and you own it no Bank can come and take it from you because it belongs to you now but you only have an Earnest that's a down payment until until again our until the Redemption of the purchased possession the taking over of what was purchased unto the praise of his glory now and uh if we go over I wasn't going to do this but I want to go to Romans chapter 8 real quick because this Falls so perfectly in line with what Paul wrote in Romans to the Roman Church uh verse 23 Romans 8:23 Romans 8:23 says uh let's start with 22 for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now now so it's still groaning and travailing in pain right now what's it what is all of creation groaning and travailing about well there was a time when creation animals all bought me life there was a time at the point of creation where there was no death death only entered in after the fall of Man when man fell that's when death entered in on animals plant but life animal life human life that's when death entered in but there was a time when there was no death there was a time before where the lamb could lay down with the lion and there was there was no death amen no thorns on rose bushes uh those of you who love your blessed desert out here God bless you uh there's thorns on every cotton picking thing that there is out on this earth right here I told people when I took them up to the mountains I said uh uh when I take them hiking they're from another place especially back East I said don't touch a thing I don't care how fluffy it looks I don't care how pretty it looks I don't care how much you want to I don't care if it looks like a ball of cotton don't touch it cuz it will sticker you because pretty much everything in the desert has stickers so I'm sorry but when we go where we're going there's not going to be a sticker desert so if you love it here I apologize but it's not going to be like that over there all that's done away with that death did not come in till after the fall all of creation is groaning and travailing together all animals life is groaning and travailing together until that time look the whole Creation in pain together still even now and not only they but ourselves also amen don't you feel that groaning in yourself yes knowing that this is not your destination knowing that this is not your your inheritance knowing that this is not where you belong you feel a groaning in yourself that says that I'm simply a pilgrim here this is not my house this is not my place of residence this is not where I belong amen amen I belong in a place that's holy and pure and righteous where there is no death where there is no pain where there is no hatred amen not a grave No Grave ever touch that soil you'll never hear the siren uh the ringing of a siren going down the road anymore you'll never see uh more and more and more uh uh urgent cares pop up all over the place hospitals and you'll never see that you'll never see a police station why no need for it right that's the place I want to go to I've had people tell me or I've heard people say oh that sounds boring well then you go where you want to go and I'll go where I want to go but that sounds like paradise to me amen but look even we ourselves there's a groaning which have the first fruits of the spirit the Holy Spirit even we ourselves are groaning with ourselves waiting for the adoption to it or that is to say the Redemption of our bodies the Redemption of our bodies when our bodies are redeemed when there's a when there's a change in the moment and twinkling of an eye and we go in a Rapture to meet the Lord in the air all the groaning is over all the groaning is stopped why because there's no purpose of it anymore amen we have the earnest going back to Ephesians now we have the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption until God Comes This purchas possession and takes it home to be with him praise the Lord amen that is our Eternal destination friend that is where we belong that is where we are going amen is to be with him forever for eternity comes to a new birth comes to the holy spirit amen Jesus said you must be borned again now remember what is the difference between the foolish virgin and the wise virgin the new birth amen amen they mean they both have oil right they both have oil but one only has it temporally one only has it on their flesh one only has it on their in their lamp they don't have a supply to take over when that runs out they don't have anything to replace it amen the wise virgin has has oil in their vessel their soul they're born again yes the difference amen amen between the believer unbeliever between the bride and church look now God of this evil age uh why as long as you go to church if thou believest he said the devil believes not make believes but he actually believes he is not saved if thou believe he says he tells the second bride or second Adam's bride the second he told first uh such Divine he there is no such thing we can prove that there's uh been a case proved this baptism in Jesus name now don't you realize the author that the authority of the church he says we've settled ni year Rome these unclean three unclean spirits went out dragons false prophets so forth we believe uh we believe that there well maybe we should leave that alone we believe that there is a trinity of gods he oh for goodness sake that's as Heathen as can be don't you ever come uh before God with such thing as that amen there's one God one Lord One Faith one baptism amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yes amen praise the Lord look now this gets kind of touchy so bear with me be not afraid he say can't stand nothing in the beginning you see what you need is original don't dig uh old digging out tearing down amen I believe that's what happens from time to time sometimes you just got to dig down to the foundation as I said last night clean out the nest start over again that's right you can make deacons out of them everything else that'll never do no good Pat them on the back uh hot bed plants amen you got to Baby them hot bed plants uh Pat them on the back call them brother uh but until they're born again of the spirit of God they're just nest full of rotten eggs that's all never hatched we need the Holy Ghost I don't mean some dry handshake said have you have you uh did you get the Holy Ghost yeah when I shook hands with the pastor no when I accepted Jesus as my savior no brother that ain't Bible doctor Paul found a bunch of good Thoroughbred Baptists up there and he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that's scripture now right uh not when you believe but but after you believed after you've received after that you have received the Holy Ghost receive now it reminds me of the of the quote that he gave I didn't print it out just thinking on that word receive you can see here until we receive until you're sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise the the the purchased possession amen that we received from God before I get that let's go over to St John I I want to read this scripture to give a little more of a foundation on that though first John chapter uh or excuse me not first John St John chapter 1 St John chapter one St John chapter 1 I want to start with verse n let me give a little bit more of a foundation on here before we continue on and again we're we're looking at and reflecting on the John 3:15-16 believeth simply a belief of existence let's look uh St John 1:9 that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many look now but as many as received there we go with that same word again as many as received not believed but received him to them gave he power power or not just power but Authority he gave them the authority to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name even to them that believe what did they go on and do their belief brought them to a reception they believed in God and received God so it wasn't just simple oh I believe God exists I say I'm saved no you must come to the place God gave to those who receive him now he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but born of God which Jesus tells them Nicodemus again St John 3 you must be born again amen must be born again to those who do what who receive him what is the receiving amen what is it you receive again it makes me think now I want to tell this quote it may it reminds me of the time that brother Brandon was wrestling with the evidence of the Holy Ghost you know because he came up in the Baptist Church uh weaned in the Baptist Church came up in the Pentecostal church and you go to the Baptist church and they just they just believe when you accept it baptized believe it you've got it well the Pentecostals believe you got to speak in tongue there's got to be an Evidence of some kind you got to speak in tongues you speaking in tongues that was was then by adopted by the Pentecostal domination church that that is the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost right and brother bam knew that was wrong because it's not scriptural right so then he goes to think what would what would be uh the evidence let's just not talk about an Evidence but the initial evidence that's that's kind of the phraseology of it in the in the Pentecostal ranks with the with the speaking in tongues it's the initial evidence they say of the Holy Ghost he said that can be right because that's not scripture so what might it be so I thought love well if you could really display the love of God the true love of God then you know that that would probably the best thing that I'd know of that you've got the Holy Ghost would just be that love amen he come to find out that many a good old priest that obviously hadn't obeyed the word to receive the Holy Ghost could produce as much love as as even Jesus Christ when he was here amen yes you go to a monastery and try to outlive any one of those monks I Dare You amen amen are they born again I don't know I I I know what they believe uh uh spiritually is not going to bring them to a new birth I know that amen but I'm not going say they're not cuz I'm not their judge right but what they believe can't bring them to that place but you you go to go to a monastery a monk or uh even someone like a sister Teresa put a put a put a finger on her life and he started to think well you know all kinds of people produce love all kinds of people show and manifest that love he went to LEL and said what do you thinking he said I thought it'd be love he said yeah that sounds great to me he said okay then he then he still decided Well you know I'll just go with that it would just just believe that that type of manifestation of love that would be the best initial evidence of the Holy Ghost then he said the Holy Ghost came God came and told him different and said it's no longer it is not speaking in tongues it is not the display of that love it is receiving the word for your day amen receiving amen not hearing but receiving you can hear something you can believe it but when you walk out the door are you going to live it right amen if you don't walk you can believe it all you want you can hear it all you want you can believe it all you want but would you walk out the door are you going to receive it did you receive it to where you're going to actually live it I've gone through the the the uh the the display before and taking my pen and you know give it to somebody and and just drop it in their lap so well I I I give you this pen but unless you take the pen and you put it in action you haven't received it from me it's just something that's sitting in your life just like a moth could fly on your lap or a fly or it it means nothing more than that right but do you receive it receiving is believing something enough that you know that when you when you live your life that's how you're going to live that's what you're going to do that's how you're going to conduct yourself receive is to uh to is to make one's own if you look if you look up in the Greek that word receive is to make one uh to make it your your own is what it says it says to make one's own but that's to make it your own ownership you take you take responsibility for it when when the word says to them that receive receive him it's not just why I believe that God is no but have you received him what does that mean that means that when you walk out into this world you're going to live the life of the word amen of Jesus Christ the word you're going to live and you're going to obey it because that's who you become because you don't only have just believed it you've received it receiving something brings it a part of you it makes you who you are it's like it's like we've said many times about revelation God Reveals His word to you that Revelation becomes a part of who you are yes amen it's not just something you do it's who you are it's not something you think or believe it's who you are when it becomes who you are then all you do is live your life amen then you you just live your life and now living your life is is is living by the word you walk and talk and live and act and do because of what is in you because of what the word says because you have not just believed it but you've received it amen not just oh I believe what he's saying but then go outside and do just the opposite amen a lot of people do that you see it all the time amen I remember growing up in and we would go to my my my parents where where they were raised and the the family Baptist Church where my dad and my mom and my sister and my son are all buried right now in that church and I remember as a kid and we went here what well that's probably been close to a year ago now we went back up there and the same things were there but when I was a kid when I was no more than Gabriel's age I go to this church and you walk outside and there's two big white pots on both sides of the doors when you go outside the church you know what those big pots full of sand are for to dump their ashes and their cigarette butts in because the first thing they wanted to do after hearing this Godly message was to walk out the door and puff on a cigarette and the church literally had two big white pots on each side of the door for that purpose now I don't begrudge somebody if you go to church if the Lord hasn't hasn't corrected you or hasn't delivered you from that yet then I understand you just keep coming to church I got criticized in St Augustine one time cuz I baptized a man who was still smoking cigarettes right and I got down the country for it I said I said well brother Brown did the same thing well you're not brother Brown you know people are just going to be critical but I said I know if somebody asks me they want to get baptized I'm not going to begr them to getting baptized come right on the head baptism is not between me and you it's between you and God right I'm just here to facilitate it amen that's between you and him so I wouldn't say no the brother wanted to be baptized I baptized him did he later kick it yeah he did yeah but I'm not saying that but I'm just saying the whole the whole setup of the thing was they knew that's what they did they weren't going to change didn't matter what was said behind the pulpit they said oh yeah that's great preacher didn't go out and live just contrary to what you just heard they said well wasn't so great after all was it wasn't great enough for you to receive it you might have believed it to be the truth but did you take it in did you desire to become what it said did you desire to let your life be molded into that image to receive not just believe but receive God help us to receive it two scriptures I want to read I'll close here in just a minute acts 238 very popular scripture that we have that we read all the time amen also a scripture that I never heard while I was in the Baptist Church acts 238 it's always John 3:16 never acts 238 Alice Gabriel I want you to be able to memorize that scripture and quote it to your mom and daddy acts 238 uh John 3:16 is important too there I'm not I'm not putting one importance over the other but I never heard that when I was a kid till I got older of course and we came into the truth and then acts 213 became a very uh 238 became a very important scripture to us Peter now look then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost AM you shall receive what a gift what did we say before amen it didn't say gift but notice what it did say now now we're finding in the scripture that even Peter on the day of Pentecost is calling the Holy Ghost it's a gift it's something God gives you to be able to uh to live his life while you're here in this human flesh when this human flesh sheds itself what is in your soul is be is who you are what that's the Holy Ghost amen that's why it says until the Redemption of the purchased possession what's the Redemption means god takes us back with him takes us home right amen we go to be with him that's that's the UN part the Lord here Peter says it's a gift Amen brother brandom called it a remember I said before because brother brandom called it a temporal gift what does that mean that means it started here and it will be over here amen in every one of our Lives it probably started at a different time when you were born again and receive the holy ghost that gift amen but it'll all end I shall I say uh at the same time unless we go by the way of the Grave amen it'll all end when we go home to be with him until this purchased possession is fully redeemed amen we we have need of that gift we have have need of that Holy Spirit in fact it is the must Jesus said Must Praise the Lord I I dareon try to go to my flight this afternoon without a ticket I'd probably be arrested I mean first thing that would do is tell me no you can't go I have I have no I have no name like that under reservation amen people used to be when I was growing up they talked about Peter at the Pearly Gates and having a name a role that he was writing people's names who are you come on anyway nice story but not scriptural right but if I went over there they' just say I have no record of you Mr Bennett of taking this flight today I won't get on that plane no matter what amen they won't let me on but if I had the token if I had the ticket if I had the Holy Ghost they can't keep me off I mean unless something wrong with a plane or something but they can't just take off in the flight and say oh we're just not taking you you're just too ugly um we don't like your voice which all things could be true but that's not enough to keep me off that plane because I paid the price right amen and it's until that gift is until look uh back in Ephesians chapter 2 uh Ephesians 2:8 for by Grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is what gift praise the lord it's a gift by grace are you saved through faith salvation through faith is a gift amen the holy spirit is a gift amen God gives us that gift to keep us in this life because it's of the importance that we need that that the Holy Spirit In Our Lives look Judas is Carri it judas's car was justified amen he was Sanctified he was right there with the rest of them when they did all the Miracles amen you go look in the scripture I give I could give you the the the scriptural reference to recognize you so how do you know he was this that and the other well the scripture tells us it was I didn't write the scriptures down but the scripture tells us the point that that he was that they were Justified and Sanctified I mean Jesus even told him sanctify them by Thy word Thy word is true and Je Judas was sitting sitting right there with him Justified Sanctified oh that's great I believe well that's that's a good step I believe that God exists okay let's get a little beyond what the devil believes for a minute amen amen to actually receive something salvation justification sanctification but he could not go on to the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost he sold his Lord out for 30 pieces of silver and he hung himself amen look uh question answers 1954 oh I hope you don't get angry with me but just something just real plain for a moment I just got to say it because it keeps choking me see got to say it now look uh then I'm going to say this there's a people that believe in justification by faith see and they live a good clean holy life they believe in sanctification too absolutely that's wonderful that's there there's justification uh is the is the first step important step to getting to Salvation getting to being born again a new birth does not come without justification amen there has to be a slate that's wiped clean sanctification that has to be the second step without the S without being justified and Sanctified you'll never receive the Holy Ghost amen so yeah those are two very important parts but that's not what Jesus said Jesus did not tell Nicodemus you must be justified no you must be Sanctified no he said you must be born again justification sanctification are just steps that lead you to that realization to be able to receive that just like our Podium here which I believe Daniel was inspired to make for us three steps to the Cross three steps to Salvation justification sanctification the Holy Ghost amen that's Christ amen praise the Lord look now judas's carot was justified when he believed on the Lord Jesus believe believe amen and accepted him as his personal savior Judas his car Sanctified St John 17:17 uh like I said San of Jesus said sanctify them by Thy word Thy word is the truth was given power in Matthew 10 to go out and cast out Devils Judas Hisar came back uh his scariot came back after he healed the sick cast out Devils came back rejoicing shouting just as many just as much as any good holy role you ever seen that right Bible said he did amen but when he come to Pentecost he showed his colors he could not go to the upper room he did not receive a new birth yes and without the new birth friend I'm afraid that a lot of people are going to be disappointed yes amen disappointed in thinking that they had something they did not have because they had something that was simply just I believe that he is I believe that God exists that person has no more than the devil's God Amen I believe that God can do this that and the other devil knows he can oh I believe God's a miracle working God absolutely don't you think the devil knows that God works miracles amen God is uh God will be a god of judgment don't you think Satan knows that amen he was cast out of heaven and down onto the Earth with him and his followers he knows that he's felt it but there's one thing the devil cannot do and that's come through the blood and be your brother amen he cannot get to the place of being born again yes amen because that just like Judas is where he showed his colors right cannot be born again the Bible says Jesus said you must be born again yes amen amen praise the Lord now I must add this as I close here and I've said this before but I feel compelled to say it again we understand and recognize now that all all babies go to heaven it does not mean they're predestinated but until a child comes to the point of of accountability till they come to the place in their lives where they recognize right and wrong right God doesn't hold that child guilty of anything that they did as a child because they don't know the difference of what's right and what's wrong all babies go to heaven amen me and my wife saw a story the other day of a little 2-year-old that got shot and killed by illegal aliens that were shooting and shot this little boy shot her too but she survived the mother and but killed the little boy and we looked at each said well he has no more problems amen that little boy is just fine the mo mother's suffering God help her but the little boy is just fine right amen all babies go to heaven yes amen contrary to what that movie 20 years ago would tell you where All Dogs Go to Heaven all babies go to heaven I can't vouch for the dogs uh if they do I probably won't have any but uh all babies go to heaven amen because that's that's how God is a just God amen amen he doesn't hold anybody accountable to that that they don't that they don't know or don't have the capacity to be able to judge rightly by amen and a child can amen let's stand if we could praise the Lord God always provides the way for us to be able to make it God for every human everybody that's ever existed has had the opportunity the ability to be able to repent ask for forgiveness be born again God would not be a just God if there was one human ever walked the face of this planet that did not was not able to repent and and be had the availability of repentance right God would not be a just God if one single out of the however many they say billions now that's walked this dirt however many billions there's been if there's been one human God God would not be a just God if he did not make the same way for everyone to be able to yes amen amen that's my God he's a just God he's true he's right amen he does everything perfect praise the Lord he's my God Amen praise the Lord Jesus let's sing this chorus I had it here and I'm turn the praise the Lord amen born again
