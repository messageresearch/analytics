us to that place amen what a day it'll be amen what a day it'll be praise the lord jesus anyone have a testimony in your heart real quick before we change the word of the service for the news yes um about three weeks ago i had taken um with leah our dog to the vet and it's in the rough side of town she's a very good vet very inexpensive overall and i was uh sitting in the car getting ready to go out and i heard someone cursing and cursing he said what is going on and then i looked the guy at the park next to me thought that i hit my door on his car and was banging his car and um and i was six seven inches away from this car and i uh i told him i'm not hitting your car and all of a sudden he get jumped out of the car and um and he was about five six five seven 150 pounds and leah had walked our dog to use the bathroom and she saw the size compared she thought i was going to kill but she knows i'm not of that nature and then i apologize and i told sir i'm sorry i got upset but you can see i didn't hit your car and and i and it was lord and i apologize but you know i really wasn't wrong and i and i apologize for something else and he calmed down i said sir god bless you he says god bless you too thank you i think it's the heat that gets to me act like this i said well no problem and we left as friends very good amen very good that's the way it should be yes praise the lord amen thankful for that anybody else your sister oh my god it was just it was so strong in our area and i found out during the stone the wings were floating like almost hurricane gala it seemed like the trees are like crazy yeah and so there was a flash of lightning and the thunder boom you know at the same time which means that's pretty close and i i thought it was in my yard it felt like it was but it was two streets away from me hit a tree two streets away from me and any other damage in that tree but that was so close and that's just a lot of praising amen yes praise the lord amen i saw i saw the news in the in the airport uh saturday uh that they were rescuing people up in scottsdale for the floods monsoon season can be dangerous very dangerous i just want to thank the lord give praise so many times every day that he's taking care of us oh my so many testimonies that he had to do all the time i amazing accomplishments all all week long i can't tell you how many times a drill slips or a saw slips or a ladder tilts over or something and the lord is always there to stop it to catch it too right yeah my i can witness to that brother pat very much how many times a day that happens to me god is good yes amen god is good we're very precautious too make sure my hand's not there i'll usually try to make sure my hand's not terrible when there's a chance of something slipping or i'm hanging on something if the ladder tilts or you know but god is so mindful every so how many times a day but god protects us amen praise the lord so thankful for that amen let's stand to our feet if we could now go to our bibles we're going to go in the very beginning chapter 1 verse 1. i was rereading just even the first part of the chapter again and there are so many sermons in the genesis one one through five it's incredible how many sermons a person the more i look at it it's almost like a man could spell spent a lifetime just preaching on the first chapter of genesis there's just so much in it but i want to take a subject it's going to take us quite a few probably a few sundays to get through but i want to start in genesis chapter one and beginning with verse one we'll just read the first few verses but before we do let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer lord jesus thankful god again today this beautiful day that you give us thank you that you watch over and protect us and keep us safe and healthy and lord for another day of life god we wouldn't even have life we wouldn't even even woke up our eyes wouldn't even open this morning if you weren't with us giving us strength and health and our hearts beating and breath in our bodies and lord you're just so good just so mindful and loving and caring and lord how a person go about daily life without knowing you is just beyond me but you are my everything lord i believe you are everything and all in all to us lord and we thank you so much for being here today and for doing these seedling abundantly and for meeting with us once again and feeling your visitation father again and lord through the songs that we sang to worship and praise you and expecting now again lord that it be no less for you to speak your word to our hearts and minister it to us lord god anoint these lips anoint our ears everything that would need to be done to accomplish the purpose you have for us to be here today we thank you for this place that you give us lord we thank you for the being able to come out from out of the world and this place is dedicated consecrated to you we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and praise for all that is said and done we thank you lord for your word and for the revelation of this word for the message of the hour lord just the strength that we get from it day by day bless it now god as we continue on in your word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse 1. i will start reading in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the night the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning with the first day and you could be seated if you'd like praise god amen as you're seated turn over with me to genesis chapter 8. we're going to go to genesis chapter 8 now read a few verses of scripture here and then we're going to turn over to acts chapter 2. genesis chapter 8 we'll start with verse 15 genesis 8 15 and god spake unto noah saying go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both the fowl and of catalan of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may uh breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth and noah went forth and his sons his wives his wife and his son's wives with him every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kind went forth out of the ark one more acts chapter 2. amen we want to girl turn over to acts chapter 2 read a few verses of scripture here amen acts chapter two i'm going to begin with verse one in acts chapter two and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen now these three scriptures may seem odd to join together and to read together but there is one commonality that these three scriptures have each of these three scriptures uh institutes a new beginning and that's what i want to speak on today uh probably again for the next few sundays however the lord leads it uh i want to speak on the new beginning new beginning in the beginning god created then you had another beginning after the andaluvian world and the flood then you had another new beginning here on the day of pentecost after jesus was born died resurrected sent his spirit back upon the earth there was another beginning but there is to be a new beginning even after this point and we know what that new beginning is the new heaven and the new earth but to get to that point uh let's just take it a little bit at a time shall we so as we begin back at the beginning uh in the beginning when god created the heaven and the earth in the beginning we know that uh that the word specifically tells us and brother branham told us excuse me that there is a major occurrence every 2 000 years approximately every 2 000 years now i want to get into something with a little detail today but not be uh too lengthy with it but a but a little detail to understand some things of where we are today because there's a lot happens between genesis 1 and where we are right now or genesis 1 and revelation 21 uh when the new heaven and the new earth that god shows to john coming down from heaven as a bride ignored for her husband there's a lot that happens between point a and point b uh but to start but to get to point b we need to we need to start with point a and and work our way to that place so uh i want to get to a couple of things to mention today uh and and one of them is to lay the groundwork for this is that we understand scripturally that there's a major occurrence on the earth every two thousand years from the time that god said in the beginning in the beginning god created well we know there's no beginning to god because he's elohim the self-existing god that never had a beginning and never will have an ending but for us and for our understanding and our little human p brains there was a beginning that we can look to how do we know that before this specific beginning there weren't other beginnings in other worlds and other things that god did we don't know he's god he can do whatever he wants people debate all the terrestrial activity and and celestial the et and all that stuff uh out in and who knows what god has beyond our reach as human beings we don't know but we know he's god and we know he's capable of doing anything and he can do and will do anything he wants to do so that's in his hands but to us we have an in the beginning that in the beginning is what we look to to start with so in that beginning god created now from that creation up to the time that god now it's strange because it only took seven chapters as we see scripturally in the bible to go for that two thousand years in that first period it only took seven chapters of the bible from genesis 1 to genesis 8. the world had become so bad the world had become so corrupt uh that god himself even said of course the word says he repented that he made man that the world had gotten so bad he repented that he made man so he destroyed all of the things that was upon the earth except we know upon the ark the the a souls and the animals and the things that god preserved that after the flood would be able to come out in a new beginning to start over again that's why god told them when they came off the ark be fruitful and multiply let the animals go forth and be fruitful and multiplied the humans which is animal flesh go forth and be fruitful and multiply and and that was the multiplication that began that new beginning it did not eradicate sin however like in the beginning there was no sin sin was still remember brother aaron teaches us that the serpents he went through the ark the serpent scene went through the ark and on the other side there was still that sin but it was a new beginning of another what we know to be the 2000 years after the flood or as we could term it uh as the world's terminology is as well they used to i don't know if they do anymore or not um did they still term uh the smart kids that go to school do they still call the time between there and before jesus christ was born do they still call that a uh bc yeah they still in school they still call it bc so we we still i still call it that i just don't know if they officially called bc that's the bc time before christ in between that time another 2 000 years that takes us all the way through to the birth of jesus christ and then there's the a.d after christ now does he still call it a.d i don't know okay so we will for that point of understanding that after death after christ and his death burial and resurrection that's the a.d period of the time that we live now in this 2000 year so there's a major occurrence that happens like that every 2000 years upon the earth let me read you something here in future home now if you've never listened to future home uh i would encourage you to do so now it's three hours and 45 minute four hour sermon so it's quite lengthy uh it would be challenging to listen to especially with most of our busy schedules in one sitting but if you could listen to it a little at a time 30 minutes a day hour a day whatever you can do it'll really be a blessing to you it's a very powerful sermon and kind of gave me the thought for this series here on the new beginning but from that future home the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride is the full title he preached it in august of 1964. he makes this statement the world has now almost 6 000 years now remember he says almost 6 000 years so this is going to be a little less evangelistic today and a little more teaching if you will there has been almost 6 000 years but not understand brother brown spoke this in 1964. now we're 22 plus years beyond the year 2000 okay and i want to i want to try to break something down to you later even about that but in 1964 brother branstad now we've been almost 6 000 years uh that's the world almost 6 000 years old see in every 2 000 years it's had a destruction of some kind an event that's took place now brother branham called it destruction but the the first 2 000 years was certainly a destruction where god destroyed all the light that was on the earth except for what was on the ark certainly the second one was of course jesus christ when christ came and sacrificed his life at calvary he dropped his blood upon the earth was that major event destructive maybe wouldn't be considered a destructive time but we but we do know that that was a major occurrence that took place when jesus christ dropped the chemistry of the blood from his body the body of god that dropped upon this earth it bought b-o-u-g-h-t bought that earth back to its original place because this was god's creation god created it it was his but when adam lost it he lost his inheritance he lost his right to life and he lost the earth that he had control over he lost the book of life which he had in his hands he lost all to the one that he lost it to except of course the book of life which satan's dirty hands couldn't take it that way back to god but he lost this earth and satan took claims over this earth now satan still has a as a squatter rights upon the earth but he does not own it anymore when jesus christ dropped that blood upon it it bought this earth as we have said so many times about our own selves this earth out of the pawnshop god redeemed this earth the earth itself from which all of our bodies came he redeemed by dropping his the chemistry of his blood upon the earth a major occurrence a new beginning that started now we know for us that new beginning was the spirit of the blood that came and went to god and came back upon the worshipper in the form of the holy spirit that was our new beginning as a spiritual perspective for this 2000 years that we are still in so the andaluvian world the destruction the flood the uh the the bc world before christ the dropping of his blood upon the earth and then the bc or a.d world which we live in now that was after that time which will in in due time will find its destruction as well by fire so brother brown again every 2 000 years it's had a destruction first 2000 has been a major currency every 2 000 years first 2000 the flood came and he baptized it with what water amen baptize this world with water next 2000 jesus came to sanctify and claim it by dropping his blood upon it and called it his own again brought it back redeemed the earth back to its rightful owner back to the right place that's why he says pawn shop because a person one person was a a rightful owner if i went and bought this phone and i went and bought this phone and it was mine and i took it to a pawn shop and said okay i want a little money for that but i reserve the right to come back and buy this phone back from you when i get the money to be able to do it that's why the pawns ask why i guess brother random so aptly called it out of the pawn shop because it never really relinquished his right to it he always had the ability to go back and claim that property for his own again paying the right price with the right price in this case was the life and blood of jesus christ god himself that brought this earth back so when that blood went to the ground and bought this earth back to god so now it belongs to him again and if it belongs to him it belongs to you because everything that was he everything that is his is ours and of course he had to do that you say well why the earth because every one of our bodies come from this earth the bodies that we are housed in the bodies of every christian every son or daughter of god from time the beginning of time belong that came from this earth belongs to god amen every one of them you say this body will be annihilated no it will not this body does not get annihilated it gets it it gets its uh uh it comes into a glorified condition it doesn't get annihilated and done away with it we have no need for that well yeah we do because the bible says we do brother branham said we would amen we come back when we leave this world uh let's just say the saints that have gone on uh they're in a heavenly realm now they're in their theophany but when that voice calls that theolph and he comes back and as brother branham said picks up this body in a glorified condition amen that's why it's able to be here that's why christ was able to be here and it comes in a glorified condition so that is the glorified condition that god called why the purpose of this earth needed to be purchased back amen because every bit of us you're not just your soul was bought saints amen your spirit your body god owns it all he all of all who we are belongs to god not just our soul our soul is going back to him that's the most important thing of course because that's the life that's the that's the thing that houses god but this body god's coming to pick this uh we are coming to pick our these bodies back up in a glorified condition live in a glorified state brother branham said i used to wonder uh when i get on the other side well we'll just be like clouds and just floating around and saying oh hey dennis hey uh lydia hey you doing and just floating by as clouds just going around up there and then he said god took him on the uh beyond the curtain of time and showed him and he got up there and there were humans standing just like you and i are right now he went up and shook their hands hugged their necks sisters because there's no sensation there hugging him around the neck or our precious brother yes he said it's just as real as it is right here why because god purchased this back so that we would be in that condition when we get there yes but it'll just be a glorified kid it'll be in the state that it was supposed to be in the garden of eden to start with amen before sin entered in before sin took control that's why his blood had to come and redeem that back so that part that that 2000 years that brought this uh this earth back to himself he claimed it dropped his blood upon it and called it his praise the lord all right i'll come again king and queen this and he says the second but he means the third because that's the first second then this would be the third two thousand years uh what does he do he comes and gives his rest period and then burns her off and claims it for his own and his own come back on it and now he's talking about uh a a millennium or type of seventh day that he comes back but each each time remember each period there's something that happens after each period of each 2000 years there's an occurrence that takes place a major occurrence that takes place that was the the point that brother branham was trying to make here that occurrence that happens every 2000 years now that brings us to a point it brings us to a point that people so many times get themselves scrupled up in they try to take and if this is a word mathematize everything add subtract or a thousand years is one day one days a thousand years and it's been so many years and how many days and how many minutes and how many seconds and and they try to they try to say that this is going to be the day or this is going to be the month or this is going to be the year and i've known people in this message to try to do that people in this message to try to say oh god's coming back in in in august of 2022 he'll be here you can count on it i've done the math what math if it's not simple enough that a six-year-old could understand it then something's wrong amen it should be in the place god doesn't make his word so complicated that you've got to learn calculus and trigonometry to be able to figure it out it doesn't work that way it's got to be in simplicity now to throw the whole thing out of caterer let's look at this for a moment the julian calendar that we know of today that we go by the julian calendar is 365 and a quarter days so that's why we have the one extra day every four years in february for what we call leap year 365 and a quarter day how did they come up with that they came up with that by the revolutions of the earth and hitting a certain star at a certain time and they figured that's how long it took for the earth to go all the way around to get to this point again 365 and a quarter but the prophetic calendar in the prophetic calendar there's only 360 days in a year 360 30 days in every month 360 days now which calendar are you going to judge your math by right who are you going to take as the supreme authority that this is the correct way to say it's got to be this day or this moment or this month of this year see because it's thrown all out of cater if you were to do that let's just say if the prophetic calendar had gone through all the way to this time the year 1971 would have actually been the year 2000. now something happens every 2000 years and that is correct how far behind are we i don't know and i'm not saying that prophetically and i'm not saying that's absolute i'm just saying that if you do the math that 1971 30 days in a month 360 days in a year 1971 would be the would have been the year 2000. amen now let me just read this let me just read this to you that brother brown the 70 weeks of daniel brother man makes several statements about it before i do that let me mention something here anybody that's a student of the bible who's read their bible through who's studied the bible looked at a lot of the the dates or the the years you'll notice that there's what the world would claim variance in certain days certain years certain numbers of years like how long were the children of israel in egypt boy i always say 400 years then you had moses he was 80 years before he ever went to uh to go back to egypt to get the israelites out god sent it back there's places in the scripture where it talks about i think it's 440 years we understand that in so many times in the scripture there's approximate times that's given you say 400 years sometimes now understand i take the little the scripture completely literal i'm not a figurative person with the scripture i believe it means what it says and and and it produces what it says it would produce i'm i'm a literal interpreter of the scripture i believe it means what it says but now when you look in so many of these places and you can see where the the times the years can again look to the world as being contradictory well it says so much this time or it says so much this time where it said it was so many years or it was so many years over here well when it gets to the point that it's it says well it's 400 years it now some places in the scripture it does say the word about now how much leverage does the word about give you one year two years five years ten years i don't know but it says even many times about this long or about this many years oh we don't know but if you want to take it as i said i'm a literal interpreter of the scripture from january 1st to december 31st that is 400 years to the day 400 years i don't believe it was like that i believe it was approximately during that period of time give or take a few a few years or a few dozen years i don't know see because god doesn't dwell in those time elements right one day's a thousand years thousand years is one day what do we know so if we take it as a literal say january 1st to december 31st well december 31st they left egypt no it didn't work like that i don't believe it did right to from january 1st to december 31st and on the 31st god didn't keep them there one second over 400 years i don't believe that's the way the scripture is to be understood or to be revealed to because and so many times are like that there's those approximate periods of time that the scripture goes into is about around approximately 400 years so to try to pinpoint something down to an exact moment day second now i'm probably getting ahead of myself on the quote but brother branham says that the lord does that to keep all of us studying and looking and in prayer and in consecration of our lives because we don't know it could be before we leave this building it could be 10 years from now we don't know yeah but we keep pressing that battle we keep our hearts clean we keep our minds pure we keep our focus on him continuing to press this battle regardless if it's in five minutes or five years amen now that being said let me read this seven weeks of daniel got two brother man says we got two or three different calendars we go back to the old astronomy calendar we find out that that in the julian calendar there's 365 and a quarter days in the year they timed that by the passing of sardis and different stars and so forth to time it out we find it in the roman calendar that we live under now 365 days in a year by the calendar but in the christian or prophetic calendar we find there's only 360 days in a year now which one are you going to go by because it well that one seems like five days but five days is just one year well when you spread that over a thousand years two thousand years six thousand years that's a huge gap that's a big amount of time in days now you might wonder how this confusion came about now listen brother braham says listen this closely because he's he's putting this out for the for us to understand he says now this i can only say as myself speaking i believe that back before the andalumian destruction back in the days of job and so forth they kept the times by the stars and we understand or back before that time that the world stood upright and then the sin of man the overflow of the world and uh and the floods come it tilted amen therefore when we have the great we have these great ice glaciers and so forth and all the top and bottom of the earth is filled with ice so once we had it straight up following it one way then it became tilted 23 and a half degrees it tilted which changed of course the rotation the times before we'd see the stars and those things that would happen now that's what he said he believed happened personally i'll take his word over anybody for that matter i was going to say certain specific ones but i'll take it over anybody even if he's just saying now this is just me uh i'll still tell unless he create corrected it later which i don't ever find that he did uh i'll take that even if it's just his opinion his opinion is probably greater than most if not all scientists today ice glaciers full top and bottom of the earth now we know that and the earth does not set straight up and we know that scientific fact we know that no there's no debating that they know that does not set straight up it sets tilted that shook it from where the moon and the stars where we were looking at it misplaced it or you could not keep time by it anymore because it was lopsided tilted therefore it would not hit them stars at the same time because it's out of cater to them stars you understand he said i believe that's what it is now how does a person feel like they can mathematize the scripture to say it's got to be this specific time or day or year jesus said no man knows the day or the hour right so how would we even i don't even understand why a christian who sees that scripture would waste their time to try to figure out what day it's going to be right and i'm sorry to be so blunt but to me that's just a waste of time your time could be so much better used than trying to figure out the day moment year month that jesus is coming back amen and the truth of it is it doesn't really matter when he comes back because he may come back for you today amen and if he comes for you today that's all that matters to you amen amen all that matters to you is the time he's coming to take me amen to me that's what matters yeah i care about all of you yeah my family i care about all of you but what matters to me and my salvation is when is he coming to me take me home because i may go before the tribute before the uh the rapture i don't know so that so when you get down to it you mathematize all these things what does it really mean see and it is to confound the the brilliant minds the the brilliant minds of today still have yet to figure a lot of these things out obviously they have figured and found a way to figure out a lot of things we've had a lot of smart men on the earth they figured out a lot of things unfortunately most of them didn't understand the scriptural the spiritual application of it but they understood the principle of it and the fit and the spiritual application or the the uh the scientific application of it but they're smart men but still so confounded there's there's just no one way to say that's exactly right that's in god's hands amen again remember listen i'm going to read it why brother battle said it's that way he said i it's it's laying back in that condition only shows that this is a period of time can't you see god don't have things out of cater god doesn't he's just letting it run like that for a time and i truly believe that this was done and at this last days is when god is going to reveal these secrets to the church he hasn't done it before and the reason he hasn't done it is to keep the church watching and praying all the time amen because you don't know yes amen it it's always something that keeps our vision focused on one thing and and pressing towards that thing amen that mark we talked about last week that mark he said it's to keep them watching and praying all the time not knowing when it was going to be but remember daniel 12 he said the wise shall understand in the last days it has been given the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the holy ghost bringing the church the revealing of that day that we are living in just as gabriel came to daniel the holy spirit comes to the church in these last days to reveal these great deep secret things amen understand and it's to understand what he's coming to take us home when is his choice it's his decision but we are continuing to are to continue to watch and pray yes amen keep our focus don't lose that enthusiasm for the coming of the lord amen therefore then stars wouldn't pass in line of the earth at the same time as they used to therefore the roman calendar is wrong too because you cannot put together the days so how do you figure it out it's not to be figured out that's kind of probably the baseline point that he was making i'm making to understand it's not to be figured out it's just to believe there's just been so many things that i could say right here that we find out even nature itself that talks about it so in that we see that the scripture yet still talks about and reiterates to the point of 30 days in a month especially in the new testament now if you look in the new testament there are several places but if you go to revelation 11 and 12 specifically yes there's more than those two but those two specific you'll see that the bible talks about the 103 score 1 200 and 3 score days that is three and a half years exactly yes that's three and a half years exactly by 30 days in a month that scripturally two thousand three of one thousand two hundred three score days is three and a half years now you can do the math that's not hard to do if you take that and divide it out by 30 days in a month you get three and a half years well what's that three and a half years that's the three and a half years after the bride leads or the tribulation of that period of time before or after the rapture to the time that the millennium sets in because remember in daniel 70 weeks he was cut off in the midst in the middle so christ's original ministry was approximately three and a half years correct the second or that last half of the 70 weeks is the second half that happens after the bride is gone that three and a half years that's the time that christ comes to the jews and reveals himself to the jews and they look at him and they say where did you get those scars and he says in the house of my friends and they realized who he was who he is they realized they crucified him and they put on sackcloth and ash and mourned for weeks months because of it because they crucified the very messiah but they did it because they were they were blinded yes their eyes were blinded they were looking for god in a certain way and he didn't come that way so they missed him amen there i you say their eyes were blinded god blinded their eyes uh i say that that they were blinded because they were looking in a different direction they were looking for something else you know you can completely miss something if you're looking in the wrong direction yes if some if i know somebody's coming down the street up here and i'm standing at the front door staring at the door that car will pass me i'll never see him because i'm looking the wrong way i'll miss it i was blinded to them if it's coming down if there's a car coming down the road and somebody says it's a yellow convertible and i'm looking for a green uh pickup i'll miss it the yellow convertible go right behind i won't even know anything about it so you see you can actually be looking at something a certain way and miss it completely because you're looking at it you're looking at it wrong and the jews were looking at it wrong that's why they were blinded that's why they didn't see him because they were looking at it wrong it was their their organizations denominations their their their system that caused that it's just like the denominations today i i believe most of those people in denominations are just as sincere as they can be they're just looking at it wrong yeah they haven't applied that isab that we read last week in the in the laodicean church age that jesus said by i said that you may apply the i said that you can see well they can't see because the eyes have not been applied they probably don't even know there is any such thing they just i believe jesus well the devil believes in jesus that doesn't get you to heaven believing in jesus amen but it brings us to a point of understanding that they didn't see him but they will see him in that three and a half years the two witnesses come in revelation 11. the woman the bra of the the jewish uh woman hid in the woods uh woods he had three and a half years uh one thousand two hundred three score days three and a half years that's that second half and at the end of that god reveals himself to them and they recognize who he is amen now what god does to those that have that pass away before that time that's up to him amen i i couldn't say but i know if you die believing you'll be there yes amen that's that's just how god does it that's his choice however he decides to do it now but in revelation 11 and 12 it does speak about that one thousand two hundred and three score days that god has uh that for the for the jews now in the andaluvian world and we'll get back to this in just a few minutes but in the andaluvian world you see how satan perverts everything that god does satan perverts everything god does so much so that we know numerically according to the scripture god does work in new marriage it didn't say worked in mathematics but god is mathematic so but but he does work in numerix threes fives sevens tens twelves we know he does scripturally the threes of course becomes very prominent in that three is the number of perfection the andaluvian world the bc world and the a.d world are the three manifestations of those periods that god works in now we're at the end of that last one we know that uh the first two we we've already we've already at or passed that last one are we in the year uh 2018 if if that if that prophetic calendar was correct if it has been that way in god's mind now not not only earth we know that the earth rotates at a certain rate and and we know by science that you can watch the stars and say three and a half three uh 365 and a quarter days it takes for that thing to go around we know that the way it is today but i'm not necessarily at this point with all the methods trying to figure that out i'm concerned most about god what is in his mind what is in his heart how does god see it not how does not what my calendar says not what my clock says my watch how does how does god see it because that's what matters to us how god sees it not what science says about it but how god sees it and how does god see it well we can only know about what his scripture says amen you had an andaluvian world you had the the bc you had the a.d and now we're at the end of that period of time now if that 360 days in a year was to was in god's mind the perfect way of it three sick 30 days in a month 360 days a year if that's god's mind of it and that's the perfect way that he has set then we're actually in the year 2050 to god i think it's because the year 2000 is 1971. how late are we how late is this if a major occurrence happens every two thousand years where are we today friend we're we're at the end of the end of the end of this this is this is that proverbial uh cliff you would say that if i took one more step i'm going off the edge if if time pushes me much more we're going to be going off the end but thank god in this case we're not going to be going off the end we're going to be going up but we're at the end of it that's the point we're at the end of this the first 2 000 years just like god does to the man just like god does to the human the first two thousand years god takes this earth and he baptizes it amen he gets it ready he sanctifies it the earth in that condition now second two thousand years jesus comes god he sheds his blood upon this earth amen justifies this earth just like he does for us just like even even a baby that is born you look at a child that is born what happens when a child is born first thing comes water amen next thing comes blood next thing comes life well that's that's god's pattern all the way along the same things happen to our spiritual bird water blood life his spirit comes and takes control of our lives that baptism of the holy ghost as brother branham said makes way listen to me close i wish i had this quote but i don't i've read it to you here before makes way for the person of christ to come live in you he said that's what the baptism is for to make way for the person of christ to come and live in you those three steps justification sanctification holy ghost get you to the place amen that christ is pleased to come and live well that's why he's getting this earth to that place friend because this is where we're going to live that's why he had to do this earth the exact same way because this earth is where we are going to live in this new heaven and new earth is right here on this earth on this planet is where we're going to live so we had to do it the same way before he could set one more foot on here it had to be completely purified amen that's why now you get certain songs for people and these songs talk about jesus coming and setting foot on this earth no no no no no that doesn't happen sometimes we do sing those songs i'll sing them every once in a while but that's not scriptural this next time when god comes to take his bride home he does not set foot upon this earth the only foot that's set upon this earth that's the semblance of jesus christ is you me that's the only footsteps that's going to walk this earth now that's resemble or or is jesus christ in flesh god in flesh is going to be you yes when he comes we go to meet him in the air yes he doesn't come back on this earth again cannot come back on this earth again redemptive process has already been done the next things for him to do is in a pure this place gets into a purified condition and we come and we walk out with him in the millennium on the way on the ashes of the wicked right only way he could do it has to be purified so the third one water blood fire spirit amen you say fire yeah well what do you think the holy spirit was it came into your life it's the holy ghost in fire and it's keeping me alive amen you know that song keeping me alive keeping me alive it's the holy ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive jesus is keeping me alive yes it's a fire that burns all the old nature out that eradicates and completely destroys any semblance of sin in your soul on this earth a baby is born amen oh it's the life of god that comes brother abraham tells us there's an angel when a woman is pregnant he talks about getting sweet there's an angel that is sitting there just waiting for that life to issue forth and that angel is just right there waiting to match with that little child yes so old babies go to heaven amen any baby that dies before the age of accountability they go to heaven are they predestinated we don't know that but we know they all go to heaven because they're still innocent that that life is just waiting right there water blood fire now god's going to destroy this earth with fire and never we know the prophetic vision brother brother green reminded us over and over and over and over and over again burnt border the border coast to coast this country anyway right the world will be that way it has to be purified yes even brother madam said in this new heaven and new earth even the atmospheres the air around us the molecules and atoms everything in the sky and the the the the atmospheres all around us will explode because it has to be purified there cannot be a speck of sin when he comes and sets his foot back here again not aspect of sin praise the lord that's the place i'm looking to saints yeah not aspect of sin there can't be that's why god had to take that andalubian world and then baptize it and this bc world and and drop his blood on an end in this last that we're in it'll be destroyed by fire obviously after the bride's gone right we will be gone from here when it strikes this earth and then you have that period of time and the tribulation sets in at the end of it the nuclear destruction all that destroys this earth burns it up and we come in the millennium and walk out on the ashes of the wicked revelation 19 praise the lord jesus christ a white horse all all those white horses with him behind him coming amen down upon for this last time now that's before the white throne judgment remember that is still that millennium is still a period of time amen still have not you say well enter into the eternities yes our bodies have but as this world continues to unfold that itself the seventh day amen the seventh day it's been two thousand two thousand two thousand six now that's sick because one day is a thousand years a thousand years is one day one two three four five six days what's that seventh day that's the thousand years of rest when god himself in genesis took that seventh day to rest is the seventh day of rest it's also a thousand years one full day since the fall in the garden of eden not one human has lived one full day on this earth to god not not a human has lived 1 000 years because of the curse of sin no man has lived on this earth no human has lived on this earth a thousand years methuselah was the closest 969 but nobody has until that curse is broken of the original sin and when the original sin of that curse is broken and christ and his bride come back upon this earth to walk out of the ashes of the wicked in the millennium period it'll be 1 000 years right amen breaking of that original sin because man will then live upon this earth one thousand years praise the lord breaking that that sin that other beginning but now as leviticus teaches us i've got to close here there's an eighth day that we enter into you say eighth day how does an eighth day come i think it's the video leviticus 26. uh we we may get into that a little i'm not sure sometimes some of those laws and things out of leviticus kind of get a little dry so we might hit some highlights of it but uh i want you awake when we get done it's like it kind of you can study it on your own but it talks about an eighth day and what is an eighth day because that throws out the complete pneumatics of the bible right but that eighth day is just a holy convocation of the rolling over of the beginning of a new beginning yes amen it's a rolling over a beginning of the first day again which starts after the millennium after the gaga magog after the white throne judgment when the holy city the new jerusalem comes which is going to be our ultimate goal that we're going to get to when we're finishing this series up that new city the new jerusalem that we're going through that beautiful city that's been set up that come down as a bride adored for her husband let's just read it before we go can we do that let's go to revelation 21 revelation chapter 21 probably all read it i want to read it together here again now you notice as you're turning there satan as i said earlier has perverted all the things the works of god satan's perverted all the works of god you notice in in the seals when we talked about him breaking uh the the breaking of the seals the revealing of the seals was to expose satan satan and his tactics to the church ages there's a white horse rider there's a red horse rider there's a black one and a pale horse rider now that three is what encompasses those church ages that last one is just death right the fourth one is death the fourth one only rides for the complete destruction amen the first three listen now i'm sorry tom's getting away from me but those three now are the ones that we described in the new birth justification sanctification holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost making way for christ to come live in you amen those three horse riders white red black are simply conditioning this world to get it to the place that the pale horse rider comes and murders kills death hell death and hell follow him right we know that scripture tells us for death it's not a third writing per se because each one took a couple of thousand years but it's that last the first three just made way for death to come in that death is eternal separation from god and in this case that death is physical death a killing murdering destruction the bible says they'll kill you thinking they're doing god or service amen now not you will be gone in the rapture but they'll be killing thinking they're doing god thinking thinking they're doing god a service mind but you see how satan steals it his goes forth in threes just like god does you go look in in the greatest deception i'm going to say it this way the greatest deception that satan has ever conjured up to get good moral god-loving people to believe that there are three gods the trinity right right the greatest deception satan has ever conjured up that there are three gods instead of one three what has he gotten po in the pope in rome the three crowns the the the crown has the the three crown thing of the pope and it's just it's just all satan does and a perversion of what god does he's done the exact same thing his threes have been a perversion of what god has already showed his satan's powers the same way power of the trinity that horse the the the crown the viker crown it's just all the perversion amen trying to convince people there's three gods amen remember evil spirits travel in the titles of father son holy ghost amen i'll never forget that lesson brother green called us about abracadabra remember that and then wow anyway let's move on because i'm going to close here revelation 21 and i saw a new heaven and a newer and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away now remember that well we'll get to that later you know the pass away it's a a word that starts with p i forget it doesn't mean annihilated it just means change from one form to another but we'll talk more about that later and in the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea why was there no more sea because it was a destruction of the earth the underneath the earth will explode the atmospheres will explode everything from under the crust of the earth everything above the crust of the earth and all the atmospheres and heavens will explode well no wonder there's no more seed amen no mercy and i john saw the holy city praise the lord new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adored for her husband and i heard a great voice out of the heavens saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god my hmm and god shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away praise god and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he's uh and he said unto them unto me right for these uh for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is the thirst of the fount of water of life freely to he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable murders whoremongers sorcerers adulterers and all liars shall have their part in the lake of fire which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death my mind but look at that beautiful city amen john saw that so what's that song john tells of the city he saw coming down he meant as a bride adorned for her husband that's where we're going amen that's going to be the focus of our endpoint that new beginning that that new beginning is the beginning that our hearts are longing for yes that new beginning is the beginning that we're looking to enter into at any time not go not going off the cliff but uh am i amen let's stand if we could i'm so looking forward to that time god calls us home be no more sickness no more pain no more sorrow no more parting over there amen praise the lord i wanted to sing that course if i can find it here it's what a day that'll be if you find it there sometimes i don't have a song ahead of time i just have to as it comes to me as i'm sitting here 204 is it [Music] amen [Music] how do i find it praise the lord what a day that'll be saints praise the lord there is calming a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky no more [Music] tears forevermore [Music] glorious day that will be [Music] oh hallelujah a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and he leads me through that promised [Music] glorious day that will [Music] be no sorrow [Music] with the one who died for me oh what a day a glorious day that will be [Music] my hallelujah i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and he leads me through that promised land [Music] amen amen hallelujah no more sorrow no more death no more pain no more partying yes amen oh my sometimes in this world it just seems like that's so far away saints but we're just right there amen it's just right there we can reach out and grab it reach out anytime amen he's going to call us to go home to be with him i look for my dad mom sister brother family that's gone on the other side [Music] time any time praise the lord i'm going home going home a new beginning praise the lord won't even resemble this one amen but i'll know him i'll know you we'll know each other sit down we won't have to part worry about time clocks just be eternity together yes amen set out for 10th as it would be 10 000 years on the oak tree talk it over won't seem like a moment amen praise the lord what a day it will be yes what a day it will be the lord god we have a promise we have a promise [Music] so thankful god graciously bless you today i pray something was said to bless you help you in some way today lord be with you keep you through the week amen appreciate your prayers for all the requests and all the needs we had amen continue to pray for those situations that have come up and this is my rest week so i try to get a little rest this week but there's always things to do amen praise the lord so god bless you richly appreciate you love

we'll be dismissed in a word of prayer anyone have anything before we go today amen lord reach the vessel have noticed now keep in mind keep in prayer um that the places in here are filling up and they're all full i think except a couple of things over there which we couldn't use in this place next door so just pray if the lord wants us to stay here then it'll be all right and i i think did you tell me though sonia told me that one of the places is leaving t-shirt shop on the bottom thrift shop two places are leaving oh praise the lord as soon as you say something they're all gone i don't and and i don't i don't want it to be that way for craig i want the lord to bless him because he blessed us and gave us this place i know it's a good bit less than market value uh i don't want him to be uh not be blessed as a result but uh takes a little bit of pressure off when we have some extra places that he can put people if they come looking so but if the lord has another place for us that's okay too amen i i i'd like to have a more permanent place something that we know is ours and whatever so but and but who knows we may never have that maybe maybe we just don't have enough time for that well i don't know just whatever the lord's will is that's what we're doing but uh appreciate your prayers in that and we'll see what happens so the lord's got it under control anyway so if he if he does move us out of here there will be a place for us that's just that's just the way i believe it i believe he's always done it he will continue to do it amen praise the lord so god bless you we love you amen you're welcome you know if you ever need anything just let me know we'll do everything we can to be here for you and so god bless you thank you for a beautiful day and sunday and all the rain that you've given us provided and keeping us safe through those storms and the wind and the rain but lord how majestic it is that you've created this weather in this system a raw power that that
