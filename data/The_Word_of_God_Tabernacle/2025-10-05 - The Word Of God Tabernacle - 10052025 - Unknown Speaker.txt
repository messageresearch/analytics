Amen. I got a text from Sister Julie this morning. uh her sister Kristen I guess ruptured her Achilles tendon in her foot. So she had surgery on that foot and her foot is uh well you know the Achilles tendon is basically useless from the you know foot up even into the calf. Her foot's wrapped up. So Julie stays home to take care of her and to help her there today. So please remember sister Julie Sister Kristen in prayer. Amen. I will say one thing about uh Kristen. She helped us move when we moved into this place and uh she's never set foot in church, but she pays her tithes faithfully. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, it's just it's just the grace of God. God blesses her for it, too. I know that. Amen. Because that's the promise of his word. But yes, &gt;&gt; she's never been to one single service. Amen. But in her heart, she has it that uh she does She does that. Uh she does pay her ties. So we're thankful for her. So please remember uh Julie staying home with her and her uh speed of recovery for her sister Kristen. Also got a text to talk to Danny the other day. Um he is doing good. He's back home. Uh he did have to have all of his toes removed. Uh but he was giving God thanks in the in the text to me. He was giving God thanks for uh he said he had not gotten to the hospital when he did, the doctor said he might have died. Uh so we're very thankful that you know how the infections are that get in your body and um you know if you don't catch him just in time if that infection gets certain place and and over a certain percentage of body something there's nothing doctors can do at that point. Uh but the doctor did tell him it's good thing he came when he did and he's thankful that the infection didn't get into the bone and uh that uh all and that all he did was lose his toes. So, he was very thankful that all that happened was uh all of his toes on his left foot. So, amen. But we want to remember brother Danny in prayer. The Lord would grant him a speedy recovery. The Lord would bless him. Also got a text yesterday from Tabitha. Uh she said that Emma is not feeling well today or wasn't feeling well yesterday. So, please remember her in prayer.

So uh but she is feeling better. She is doing good. She's recovering well according to her text uh from her hip surgery. Uh but we certainly definitely want to continue remember Sister Pat in prayer the Lord would just touch them. Amen. And remember sister Sheilia today, she wasn't sure if she was coming down with some symptoms or if it was allergies or what, but she uh wasn't feeling well, so she stayed home today as well. So please remember sister in prayer. I was going to give God thanks for sister Leah's uh surgery, but I'll let brother Dennis do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I thank the Lord. I asked her yesterday and this morning, how you doing? She's recovering very well. That's the Lord's touch. Um, otherwise I would have stayed home to take care of her. &gt;&gt; But she says, "No, I'm fine. Go to church." I said, "That's where I want to be." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I thank the Lord. She's coming along. She gets very tired. I says, "You need to rest." And she does hurt and but she's just taking Tylenol, not those stronger meds for pain. So, thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. you know, she had that constructive surgery uh on the 2nd, October 2nd. So thankful. I knew that things must have been going well. My wife, she said, I guess brother Dennis won't be there today when she's had the surgery. She usually likes to stay with her. But I said, I haven't got a text from him.

Yes, God. &gt;&gt; And I heard you probably also say that we must put God first. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He must be first in our finances where 10% belongs to you, Father. That's your word. And you said as you as we pay our tithes, you'll pour out a blessing more than what we're able to see. We must put you first, Father, as we have a church service. As the prophet said that it if Christ is truly in your heart, you can't wait for those church doors to open up. If you don't feel that way, then it's time to to get to praying and seeking God that God will be first when it comes to being at the house of worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Lord, we must put you first when it comes to fellowshipping with believers and fellowshipping with you and and your word. Lord, we must not let the world bring us down. Even though we have loved ones that that love us, but if they're ungodly and worthy, they'll take the very Christ out of our lives that we're not careful. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We must put you first in everything. Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. You know our lives better than what we know of ourselves. &gt;&gt; You know our heart better than what we know of ourselves. Yes. The Bible says a heart is deceitfully wicked. Who can know it? &gt;&gt; And Lord, we cannot hide anything from you. We may be able to hide it from the pastor, from the congregation, from all the people that's around us. But if we're not living that life, we cannot hide it from you. Help us, Lord, to repent and get right with you while your grace is sufficient. The blood is still on the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You said in your word, if we confess our sins, you are faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Thank you, Lord. And Father, there are needs, serious needs. There are several that's had surgeries, serious surgeries. Father, sister had my brother Danny, my wife Leah.

Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And by your stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, all the other requests, I can't remember them all, but they were spoken. You heard them. That's what's the most important, Lord, cuz you heard them. You're mindful of them. May you come on the scene and grant each and everyone their need from you. May their cup runth over. May that healing virtue waters flow continually, Father. &gt;&gt; Grant it, God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless our pastor. He's worked a full week.

It brings you on the scene and feeling your presence so near, God is so wonderful, Lord. It just it just means so much. Sometimes I just I wish my voice would just would just keep strong, Lord, so I could just keep worshiping and singing. It's just so beautiful, Lord, to enter into your presence and worship and glorify you, Lord. Just being in that presence just feels so good, Father. Especially after you've been in the world all week and gone through the things and work and everything and all the the the uh demonic forces of hell in this world and things that you listen to and hear and put up with and oh God, it just feels so good, Lord, just to get into that place of worship and your presence. And God, just realize that is those heavenly places in Christ Jesus you told us about, Lord, that we stand in, that we get into. And Lord, we're just so thankful to be in that place again today in this place. And so thankful, God, that you give it to us, Lord. Now, we just pray that your Holy Spirit would once again take complete control of this service, Lord, as your word would come forth and take control of this vessel. Speak only what you'd have us to hear, Lord. And Lord, shut my mouth to anything that you would not have to be said, God. And just bless this, Lord, your uh people, Lord, and this word as it comes forth. &gt;&gt; Lord, may it come forth in power and manifestation of your spirit and help it find its bedding ground in the hearts of your people. Anchor it in us, Lord. Help us to draw closer to you, more like you in this last day through it, Lord, and recognize your word is eternal in heaven. And God, we believe and thank you for that word. God, reveal it to us now as we commit it to you. Let it not return void. Accomplish in each of us that you would have it to accomplish. In the precious, holy, and lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Romans 8:14, for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then hes of God and joint hes with Christ.

And pick up try to pick up back up a little bit where we left off last week in Ephesians. We're not going to read the whole chapter this time. Amen. But I just want to start with the 11th verse and begin there uh and try to delve back into this five-fold ministry as we've gone through and recognizing and seeing the purpose and needfulness of of the ministry of preaching of preaching the gospel. Uh people they're unbelievers, scoffers, atheists think the preaching of the gospel is foolishness. And a lot of people think of to the foolishness of them that believe that preaching is is is foolish. Uh to us it's glorious. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing. Amen. It's good that the Lord speak to us from his word and we know that to be the truth. So, amen. We're going to get back to that today. The Lord really Now, uh Ro uh Ephesians uh chapter 4. We're going to start again uh like I said with the 11th verse and try to pick up where we left off. We may background just a tad bit, not a whole lot. Amen. But try to pick up and move forward with what uh I want to speak today. Now 11th verse, Ephesians 4:11. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. Now again, the three things, verse 12, the three things that the Lord gave this five-fold ministry for that we talk about for the perfecting of the saints. We know what that perfecting is. Remember that perfecting is the edifying. Amen. Uh the uh the the building up, the bringing this to helping us get. Now uh as we said the other day, this perfecting is a different word than the perfect that Jesus talks about in Matthew 5:48. But it it but it is uh if I can say it this way in my uh I guess hillbilly vernacular it is akin to that word the same. It is not sinless perfection but it's a growing up. It's a edifying. It's a building. It's a getting to that place where we as as children are are no longer children but grown-ups. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say that in relation to of course the word that says perfect on down here. the 13th verse, unto a perfect man brings us to this understanding. Not sinless perfection, but a grownup mature person. Amen. And that's what this edifying is to do. That's why it's a different root word, if you will, or a or a different uh uh meaning. Uh because this perfecting is to is to bring to that place of perfection. Bring to a place that you're perfect or grown up. Amen. There's got to be an edifying. There's got to be a building. There's got to be a growth before you can get to the place of that maturity just like any child that's born. Amen. Of of of in normal human uh way that child has to grow up. They get older and they learn and they become more mature and they get physically mature and they get uh mentally mature and as it grows and they get to a place that they come to the position of adulthood. Now if that child is trained correctly and that child learns correctly when they get to the place of adulthood they become an adult not just a child in a big body. Amen. which unfortunately a lot of times you get spiritually and physically big children. &gt;&gt; Uh spiritually it's a horrible thing because it it's always the constant whining and crying and and and all instead of just speaking the word. Amen. Just instead of knowing your position, knowing who you are and speaking that word and taking authority over the position that you are in, knowing who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead of whining and crying about it, &gt;&gt; right? But now a a an adult that's still a child is is bad naturally because it's a child in a in a big body. They haven't matured. They haven't grown. They haven't learned. They haven't been taught. They haven't got to that place. That's why I read that uh verse uh that um uh quote last week about brother Brandham saying, "Well, the reason it is this way is because they've not been taught. They don't know. If you don't know, how do you know? You can't know unless you know. You can't hold somebody responsible for something they don't know. That's why it's essential that the ministry perfects the saints. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To bring them to a knowledge of understanding. Amen. Knowledge. That's why it talks about in here in the 13th verse, the knowledge. Amen. We're going to go over to uh Peter when we talk about that statue of a perfect man and recognize that it's contin Peter continually mentions that word knowledge to bring us to that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way you get there that's how you do it having having spiritual children with no supernatural guidance is like having a natural to ch child born with no parents. right &gt;&gt; now. They now obviously they have to give a a woman has to give birth to a child, but that doesn't mean that that child has parents. That doesn't mean that that child might have a father that fathered that child, but that doesn't mean that father is a dad is the way I put it. To me, a dad and a father are two different things. Amen. You can father a child and hit the road, but to be a dad, you've got to be there and you've got to raise that child and you've got to uh be a dad and a strong a masculine influence in that home for that child to be raised right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that that's why the hand of God is upon us to do the same thing to us. Well, the same thing spiritual, same thing natural. If a child's born into this world and has no parents, what's that child going to turn out to be? They're probably going to be one of these bums laying out on the side of the road with no purpose or meaning in life and just letting their life waste away. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing spiritually. Amen. There's got to be a growth. There's got to be spiritual perfecting. There's got to be edifying. The five-fold ministry is there to edify and to help be an instrument of God that through that instrument brings that perfecting to the saints. That edifying through the preaching of the gospel, &gt;&gt; the preaching of the good news, the preaching of the word is to bring them to that place of perfection, the perfecting of the saints, edifying. Amen. Building up, teaching them. Let them learn. Let them grow. Don't let them go forth not knowing, but teach them. That's why I said that quote I read last week. They don't know because they hadn't been taught. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I and I told y'all every anytime I've seen that, brother Ram says that a couple times in the message, I take that very seriously. Uh because I don't want to fail in that position. Amen. If a child needs to learn manners, the parent needs to teach it manners. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If the child needs to learn discipline, it's the parent that's to teach that child discipline. &gt;&gt; If that child needs to be reigned in and learn how to be in a restaurant or wherever, they then that's the parents there to teach them that. And sometimes it's hard. &gt;&gt; In fact, it is hard. Not just sometimes. It's hard uh especially when you have to uh uh enact some kind of uh judgment on that child like a little protoplasm stimulation. &gt;&gt; But it's good for that child. That child will respect you. They may hurt and they may say, "Oh, I don't like daddy for five minutes." But they'll respect you for that &gt;&gt; because they know that you wouldn't do that if you didn't really love them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a parent that really loves their child will correct their child. &gt;&gt; Yes. and make sure that child is raised right. &gt;&gt; Make sure that child has manners and and God does the same thing for us &gt;&gt; to make sure that we are raised in the nurture and admonition of God just like a a a little child is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Perfecting that five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry. Now notice, excuse me, um the the word is that's said here. It says for the work of the singular ministry. &gt;&gt; Now we'll we'll eventually probably and maybe the next t today next service probably the next two or three services talk a lot about the unity of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. the togetherness of this group, the work of the ministry. Yes. You say work of the ministries because there's five of them. No, there's five offices, but there's one work. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just like God, there's three offices, father, son, holy ghost, but there's one God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's five offices. There's pastor, evangelist, missionary, teacher, prophet. There's five offices, but there's one work of the ministry, singular work of a ministry, and that's how these each one of these offices is supposed to work together in continuity. Uh we talked about when uh I've done this before, but when brother Brandham showed brother Green about the five-fold ministry, you know, he used his hand and how he did that. I probably won't do that today, but that hand is just one hand. It has five fingers. And you and you get this little pointer finger over here, which is the which is the uh evangelist. And you get that little pointer finger, and he says, "Well, I want to do this and this. I want I want to get away from the hand." Well, if this finger gets away from the hand, it dies. &gt;&gt; This finger can't exist without the hand. &gt;&gt; This hand can't exist without this arm. This arm can't exist without this body. His body can't exist without his head, without this heart. It all has to work together. But it's one hand, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Five fingers. The thumb might say, "Well, you know, I want to." No, no. This pastor, he has to say, "Well, I'm the pastor." No, but this pastor has to work together with this evangelist and with this apostle and with this teacher. They have to all work together. Amen. All this whole everything has to work in continuity. That's why it's one ministry. That's why he said when you take that five-fold ministry and they're working together in continuity and you bring them all together and you seal it up there, you can give the devil a good walk with it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's working as a ministry, not ministries, not multiple, one ministry. Body together, unity together as one. They're supposed to work together, not against each other, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's the way it does. And and in God's ministry, that's the way it works. They complement each other in God's ministry. Now, like I said last week, if God if if God is if that is not a God called man, God has no obligation to that to that man to keep that man straight. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God has no obligation to that man because he didn't call him. if the denomination call them or if they call themselves or they're up there doing it because they think this that or the other. Having the gift of gab does not make you a preacher. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just being able to spout off words and being able to talk in front of people does not make you a minister. Does not make you a preacher. But a lot of people still do that under those circumstances. But you must be God called. If you have not come face to face with that pillar of fire, you have no business standing behind this bullpit. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what brother Bam said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that man will work with the other man that God ordained. The other man that God ordained, not denomination, not Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Methodist. No. What God ordained. When God ordained it, then then no matter where they are, who they are across the country, across the land, across the world, they all work together in continuity together. That's what brings this bride together as one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because remember, this bride is one body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She's this ministry is one ministry within this body bride. She's one together to bring that bride together. It all has to come together in that place of perfection in the place of unity, perfecting of the saints, work of the singular ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ to build up and to increase, to equip. Amen. That word is edify. To equip, to give the tools to Amen. &gt;&gt; Because although God uses a ministry to bring this truth, to bring this word, to preach the gospel. God can always be with you, but it's like brother Dennis prayer. You might hide it from the pastor. Amen. But God is always there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's funny. These guys, we worked with a worked with a different team this week. There was three guys off their team and one of the guys had a hard hat. And guys wear their hard hats. They like putting all kinds of stickers on them. They're usually foul and nasty stickers. &gt;&gt; But this one kid, he had and he's fairly young. I call him kid. He's probably in his early 20s. He had a sticker on this part of his helmet that said that has a picture of Jesus and said, "I saw that." And I asked him, I said, "Where'd you get that sticker?" He said, "Oh, some guy brought him in, had a whole thing full of stickers, and I picked that one." I said, "Well, I like that sticker." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's true. Amen. It's true. Jesus said he said, "I saw that." He does. He sees everything. But see, the pastor doesn't. Amen. The the ministry doesn't. That's why there has to be this unity, this togetherness. See, this uh uh working together for the for the entirety of the body because the body can't be saying different things. The ministry can't be saying different things. When I pray, I'll tell you how I pray. When I pray for the ministry, I pray that God bless and keep every minister that's preaching the pure, unadulterated word in the calling they were called to bring this bride to the place of perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Waiting for our loved ones to appear anytime. I said that last week. &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes it all together. See, there can't be this pulling back and forth. Brother Am talked about taking somebody, you know, your teammates's running to the end zone with a touchdown and his teammate comes over and he tries to grab the ball away from and try to run himself and the other one the other teammate says, "No, that's my ball." It doesn't work that way. We're on one team. &gt;&gt; No matter who scores the touchdown, our team got six points, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; No matter who scored it, don't matter. Don't matter if he's the shortest, tallest, fattest, skinniest, strongest, don't matter. six points to that key. So it's not us working against it. Should never be the ministry working against each other. &gt;&gt; It should always be the ministry working together. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's a there's a a vast supply of material within this Bible. There's it's endless. I mean, it's eternal. It's God. God's eternal. Amen. But just the written material, there's an endless supply. &gt;&gt; A man could preach for a thousand years and not be able to touch every part of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So they they may be on a different subject, but we're not pulling at each other. We're not fussing. That's why I think it's so great sometimes, especially like when ministers come in here, null's done it several times, and pick up, I guess, the spirit that's in here and starts ministering a lot of a lot along the same lines that we've been talking about. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's supposed to be here November 2nd. I don't expect it to be any different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might take a different subject. He might read a different scripture. He might take a different quote, but the theme of it is all on the same line, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; As God is speaking to his bride internationally &gt;&gt; around the world through the work of the ministry to edify, to equip. Amen. Again, there may come a time where the the ministry won't be there for you. Right? &gt;&gt; There may be a time where I don't have a phone in my hand to receive a text from you that says, "Pray for me." &gt;&gt; There may be a time where you're isolated from anybody that you could text or have a a a text chain that says, "Pray for me or for my uh family, whatever." And it's going to fall on you to pray for yourself, to pray for your family, to pray for those circumstances, to contact God. &gt;&gt; It's going to be up to you to contact God. That's why the ministry is here to equip you with that ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. to equip you with that knowledge, to equip you with the understanding of who you are, so that when you talk to God, you know that he's listening &gt;&gt; and that he hears you and that he answers your prayers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there may not be anybody else to rely upon, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's why there has to be an equipping because every single individual is an individual unto God of themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As each individual finger is, you're an individual unto God. As each individual makes up this one body, we are still together. Now, that's not to say that a a a brother in China may be in need of prayer and God will put it on my heart to pray for him or put it on your heart or you may have a need and put it on somebody's heart over uh in India somewhere and put it on their heart that you need prayer. I'm not saying God can't do that because he does. &gt;&gt; He does it all the time, regularly. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying that what we're doing, the ministry is to equip you with the knowledge, the ability, the understanding, the faith that you and yourself can contact God Almighty as effectively as anybody else. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and mean as much. And God respond just as well. That's why growing up in this message in truth, it really I had a I I've told you this before, but one sister that we had back in back east, uh she's she was older and she's passed away many many years ago, but so many times we get, "Oh, if Brother Brandham, we're still just here. Brother Ram just were still here." And it just never sat right with me. I knew what she meant, but my responses was, "Sister, God is still here." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was just one vessel that was to get you to the place that vessel was to equip you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that you had the faith that you can talk to God. You can reach God and you can get what you have need of regardless of who prays for you. It's your faith. You touch the hem of his garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You notice when that woman touched the hem of his garment, he said, "Who touched me? They're like, "What do you mean who touched you? There's throngs of people turning, grabbing all over you. What do you mean who touched you?" I felt virtue come out of me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Strength. Something left him. Where did it go? It went into that woman who received her healing. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He turned around and said, "You're well." He didn't pray for her. Amen. He didn't kneel down and say, "Oh, sister, where's some anointing oil? Can we find some? Would you, Peter, would you give me some oil? No, he didn't kneel down. He didn't say in in God would you father would you? No, it was her faith. He said you're well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All she did was touch the hem of his garment. What she touch him with? Faith. &gt;&gt; She touched him with a faith that brought healing to her body. &gt;&gt; And from that moment on, she was well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. That's the equipping. is getting us to the place that we we have the faith to believe and understand that is who we are. We let the devil beat us down so much with our little faults and failures and mistakes. Don't let the devil defeat you with that, saint. Recognize, yes, we need to get better. We all do. We're all still growing in the Lord. &gt;&gt; But don't let the devil pound you down with those defeats. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And ruin your faith. That's exactly what he wants to do to keep you from receiving and believing who you are, who you are in Christ. And that equipping of that truth, that message, that five-fold ministry is to bring us to that place. Equip us, edify. Edify is to equip, build up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To make a building. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To make a to build a body. That body comes forth in the image of Jesus Christ. The body that Jesus Christ died for. The body that that that he's coming for again to take home to be with him. That bride body that's without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. That's who this ministry is for is to bring us to that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Edify the body of the body of Christ till we all again till we all come in what? The unity. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got a piece of equipment on the job. If you've ever gone through one of our car washes, when you get twothirds of the way through the tunnel, there's this uh big blue arch and there's this place that has five uh well, it used to have five, maybe three now bars on it and it has uh water that shoots out from the front and comes in from the back and right &gt;&gt; this we call that a unity arch. You know why it's called a unity arch? because it's the it's the one place where all this stuff comes together and works together to try to finalize the cleaning of your car before you get to the blowers to dry it off. It's called unity because this water comes in to do this and this water comes in to do this and this does and all this comes together. Amen. To finish that car, to complete that car before it before the blowers blow all the water off. Unity. We're to come into the unity. Praise the Lord. Where it all comes together. Oh, praise the Lord. We're to come till we all come, all of us come in the unity of the faith. We're not separated. We're not divided. Amen. Don't matter what the devil tries to do to us as a church, as ministers, as church in this city, in this state, in this country. Amen. We are all one. We're all one in this body. We're all We're all one together. Come into the unity of the faith &gt;&gt; and of the here we go now. The knowledge of the son of God. Now, if you receive that knowledge, there is no uh ignorance there. There's no I well I did not know. You receive that knowledge. That's part of the ministry is to be able to receive that knowledge. Now the knowledge of the minister is just to minister and preach. What is it? We have one hour a week. So where does the rest of it fall? Now if we have two or three even if you even if we had like some churches in town and had three hours a week Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night or Thursday night, whatever it is, that's three hours. And that's still only three hours out of how many hours is in a week? &gt;&gt; 144. How many hours are in a week? I don't know. You got three at the most. So, where does the rest of it fall? Falls on you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Falls on us. Some people are only Christians when they come to church. &gt;&gt; Some people only bother to crack the covers of their Bible when they're in church. &gt;&gt; Some people only bother to hear a quote from the prophet when they're in church. Right? &gt;&gt; Some people only take a few minutes to pray when they're in church. And all of this should be a part of our human daily spiritual lives every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we grow in this in in the in the uh faith and in the knowledge of the son of God, the grace of God brings knowledge. That knowledge, not head knowledge, spiritual knowledge. Revelation. I like the word revelation better than knowledge, but that's what the Bible says, knowledge. That's how the translators translate it into knowledge. Receiving knowledge. Amen. And and there is a truth to that because as as as ministry goes forth, it it g you can gain knowledge off of that. If you receive it, if you receive it, you you've gained knowledge off of what's being said, what's being ministered, what's being preached. But it still takes God to bring it as a revelation to your heart. &gt;&gt; I as a man can't do that. I no matter how gifted brother Brandham was, there was no way Brother Brandham could give a revelation to anybody. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It takes God to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can preach a truth. You can preach something till you're blue in the face. You can repeat it. You can go and give the absolute perfect scriptural interpretation, if you will, of it from God Almighty himself. But it still takes a revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From God. It takes a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that knowledge becomes revelation. And then it becomes a part of you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Knowledge is just not knowledge at that point. Then it's who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've talked about that many, many times. So I won't go into that. But that revelation becomes a part of who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Then when you get in situations that you need God, then you call on God and you know God is going to be there. You know God is going to bless you. You know God is going to heal you. Amen. As he has done so many times before. I listen to this song. So many times I list these songs that while I'm working and this song says count your blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how big or small, count them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said when you start counting, you might find that you have trouble being able to count all of them because of the blessings of God that have rained on to you. No matter how big or small they are, count them all &gt;&gt; because he's the same God. And what happens then to your troubles? What happens then to your uh to your disease, your affliction, your thought that that that negative thought that goes away because all you're thinking of at that point is God and the goodness of God and what he's done for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's the truth. All come in unity of faith, the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man. Again, that's a different word that we saw uh in the perfecting of the saints, but they work together, if you will, these two words. Amen. It takes one word to get to the next. The translator translated it that way and used the word perfect in both instances when it probably could could have been a different word used, but anyway, one brings you to the next. perfecting of the saints, building up, edifying, brings you to the place that you're mature, that you're grown up, per uh unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go and read that real quick. Well, we're not going to do it quick, but we're going to do it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over in second Peter chapter 1. Now, it hasn't been that long since she actually had a study on this building of a perfect man. In fact, it's not been so long since we still have it on the my uh little uh whiteboard over here of the of the statue of a perfect man building up from the faith, virtue, knowledge, temper, patience. So u this acknowledgment in the scripture that Ephesians gives us that Paul gives to the Ephesians is about coming into the unity of the faith the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's that measure? That measure measures in what we're talking about that we see here in Peter. That's the measure. Praise the Lord. Accumul the culmination is love. And what is God? God is love. The capstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is what this bride is being capped with. &gt;&gt; She is the capstone. She is she is love. Now we talked last week. She she has that that co that capstone. A man of love has brought us to that measure. That measure of taking it as a pyramid as brother Brandham put it in this pyramid, this statue, this pyramid from the bottom. Faith. Amen. Everybody has faith. But then you get up to virtue and the pew fall off. You get up to knowledge, few more fall off. And temperance and patience, godliness. Or you get up to the capstone and there's just a few left. &gt;&gt; A few that can get to that measure, that measure, the stature of a perfect man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 1. Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge knowledge. Notice how Peter uh exclaims or at least was translated that way into the word knowledge several times in this passage. Grace and peace be multiply unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. Praise the Lord. How did he do that? through a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through the knowledge of him, another knowledge. Amen. Through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature. And that's just the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. The divine nature of God is his spirit. What is the spirit of God? The spirit of God is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Or the Holy Spirit. That is the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that is God's divine nature. Just like your nature is your spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your your affection, reason, conscience, affection, memory, that that that uh is is what contacts your outside body. Amen. that then that outside body then reacts on on what that spirit is. Now the spirit is still uh is still a part of humanity. Amen. Because the part that God controls is the soul. Amen. That uh the but now when you become born again of this divine nature then that divine nature is what takes control over your spirit and then takes control over your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we notice that when we become partakers of that divine nature, we're b we become born again, then it's comes at uh unto us as knowledge and virtue from God. These precious promises, where do they come from? Again, how are they expressed? How are they ministered? How are they brought to a bride body? Through a five-fold ministry. Amen. And every one of these is is in a different calling for a different purpose as we said last week. Um let's see here. Let me read this. I didn't get to this last week, but let me read this quote before we continue on with that scripture. Amen. Now notice, the nature of your spirit is your soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; N Amen. The nature of your body is your spirit. But the nature is what controls each one. If you're born with the wrong nature, as we all come in the world speaking lines, born with the wrong nature, then it affects our spirit, then it affects our body. Amen. But when when but when brother Brandham talks about that five-fold ministry, he talks about that five-fold ministry bringing bringing the body to that place of of the promised word of God here to be partakers of the divine nature of the Holy Spirit. Amen. When I learned what the scripture said, it become revelation that what I was reading was true. And when it become a revelation to me, I acted upon it. And I asked my pastor to baptize me in the name of the scripture baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when that happened then then you become you you are then a candidate to receive the Holy Ghost to receive this divine nature &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; for this divine nature to come now and take over your spirit &gt;&gt; and to take over your body. &gt;&gt; Now you see things differently, you hear things differently. Everything about you is different. I mean Paul said, "The things I used to love and now I hate. It thinks I hated out love because the divine nature come in and even changed his name like we talked about a couple weeks ago. Amen. Cuz Saul wasn't the name that God wanted him named to do what he needed to do. He needed to be called Paul. So God changed his name just like he changed the names. We talked about the name changes through the scripture. The reason why those names are important. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now let me read this because each part of this it plays its own part for its own purpose. &gt;&gt; And this is this is another reason why I believe in the separation of those offices and that a person is divinely called to a position. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me read this. But now no actually time get this by so fast. But now notice, I feel like it's been five minutes. &gt;&gt; I honestly it's been 40. 45. I think it's been five. So I have to look at the clock cuz I just think I just got started. Notice gifts in 1956. Brother says, "But notice now notice now we're at the at the at the carnival. Maybe it was all uh that's all of us here now. We're at the carnival. Maybe none of you see visions. I don't know. Maybe you'd be uh something else because we're all one big body. &gt;&gt; We're all one big body. That's brother Bam's exhortation to this. See, we're all one big body. Here's a lot of pastors sitting here. Good preachers. Now, Brother Bam said he's, you know, Brother Bam was fairly good at self-defeating. He he put himself down a lot. Uh he never acknowledged his position. Very rarely did he ever when the spirit really hit him and he was in the middle of preaching, he said, "You believe me to be God's prophet." I mean, but when he's talking soberly, he he he tried to shun that every bit he could. So, brother Brandham always put himself down. But I say that as we continue reading, here are a lot of pastors sitting here, good preachers. He says, "I can't preach. I wasn't called as a preacher." That's what he said. 1956. Now, that's what he said. I I wasn't called as a preacher. They can teach. He said, "I'm not a teacher." See, I taught a convention. Well, I may be in here in here. We're all put in a We're all put in it in a way you'll understand it. Here's a man standing here. Uh is short and strong. That's what he is. He could lift up a big something, tote it on his shoulder, and walk away with it. He said, "I'm tall and skinny." Now, I got to be the first time I think I had ever seen Brother Brandham call himself tall. I I never knew 5 foot n was tall. But brother Brandham calls himself tall. I guess he means he's taller than the guy that he's talking about that's short and strong. But he says, "I'm tall and skinny. I couldn't do what that man does." See, but God made him that way for his work. He made me this way for my work. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You understand the whole point. I try to make an understanding. I am not a pastor, prophet, teacher, evangelist. I'm a pastor. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not a pastor evangelist. I'm a pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. a pastor can teach, but I'm not a teacher. I don't come and and just teach on things. There's that. But a pastor has to delve into these avenues where there's evangelistic kind of ministering, there's teaching kind of ministry, there's things to get into to help pastor the people. Amen. But now notice, I believe, before I finish reading this quote, I believe, and I've said this before, maybe a long time ago, but I believe Brother Brandham filled every office to a degree. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Obviously, he was prophet number one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thus sayeth the Lord. He's prophet number one. He's prophet. Amen. Because thus sayith the Lord. That's his call was prophet. But as a word prophet, especially in what was given to him to do, I believe caused him to pastor people. I believe it brought him in the place of evangelizing. I believe he's evangelizing here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Missionary. How many times you go overseas? &gt;&gt; Seek people overseas. Missionary. Um overseas. &gt;&gt; Uh uh teacher, pastor, evangelist, uh pastor. uh prophet, he fulfilled every one of them to a degree. But now notice, you say, well uh if he if he if he was uh had occupied uh or or had in him the gift through a prophet gift because do you understand there's a difference in a word prophet and a gifted prophet, &gt;&gt; right? A gift of prophecy is someone that just has a gift to to give prophecy. But a word prophet is a person that has that gift. But also in him is the ability to approach these other offices to bring the word and expound the word to people. &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring this word forth in in pastor and in in apostilhip and in and in uh uh teaching and pastoring. It the ability is there to do all of those things because a word prophet, not just a gifted prophet of of Corinthians 12, not just someone that has the gift of prophecy, but a word prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. that had thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; brought the Bible, brought the scripture to life with a ministry of the breaking down and writing the dividing of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a whole different situation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And there have been very very few word prophets through the scripture and through history. Very few. I mean, there's been a lot of prophets, a lot of gifted prophets, a lot of gifts of prophecy, &gt;&gt; but very, very few word prophets &gt;&gt; that have come. In fact, brother Graham was the first one since Paul, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's been very few word prophets that were in that position to bring that word, which puts him at impart at least in each one of these offices. And he said, 'Well, if brother Brandham fulfilled the the office of pastor, why did why didn't he put Armen Neville in charge as pastor of Brandham Tabernacle? Because brother Brandham knew by the scripture that a pastor stays and tends to his flock. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he could not do that and fulfill the office that God gave him a prophet to be on the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to go all over the country, to go all over the world. &gt;&gt; He knew, yes, he was the he he called himself associate pastor. He giggled about it and I forgot what tape it was. He's we got a place for the pastor, a little place for the associate, you know, when he giggles about himself. But the truth is he knew by the scripture that he could not do that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That was not his main call. Yes, he could pastor to people. He had I I mean how many even brother Pat was in a private interview as they call it with brother Brandham. What is that? What is a private interview? He's pastoring those people. &gt;&gt; He's pastoring and giving them advice and telling them what the scripture says or what he's pastoring them. That's what a private interview is, &gt;&gt; right? when someone comes in with questions and stuff like that and he has a private interview. Yes. He's pastoring those people, &gt;&gt; when he's when he's marrying people, when he's uh attending uh officiating funerals, when he's dedicating children, and when he's when he's uh uh uh oh, what do you call it? Nominating keeps coming to my mind. Ordaining ministers. That's what a pastor usually does. Now, of course, he has other ministers come up and lay hands, too. But still, that's that's pastorial duties. But brother Brandham could not be the pastor of Brandham Tabernacle because he's on the road all the time. And he knew that. That's why he put Orman Neville or he didn't, but it was Orman Neville was voted in as pastor of Brandham Tabernacle. And Orman Neville was pastor of Brandham Tabernacle till he died. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's the reason. And then you got pastors out here that say they're pastors and want to tend to their sheep and they're burning up the roads left and right, east to west, north to south, all over the place, gone six months out of the year. That's not a pastor. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; If you're an evangelist, resign your church and go hit the road. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If you're a missionary, get on that plane and go to India, go to Africa, go to China, go to Russia, go wherever God's sending you, but don't try to pastor a church at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I will say this. I believe and this is my personal opinion and my personal belief just like brother Brandham uh God has in the scripture in certain instances little caveats of people that fulfill different offices for a different reason, different purposes. I believe uh brother Green was one of those brothers. Yes, &gt;&gt; I believe brother Green was the pastor of Tucson Tabernacle and was gone all the time &gt;&gt; because of the position that he had for the responsibility that was given to him. &gt;&gt; All the things that needed to be done at the end of Brother's ministry to carry that message across over after his passing had to be done by those that were left behind. &gt;&gt; Right? Well, the people that were left behind had to have the means. They had to have the ability. They had to be in the position. They had to have been groomed. They had to have been molded to fit that position. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And brother Perry Green was the man that fit that position. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's why I had so many people say uh complain about Brother Green as a pastor. Brother Green wasn't really a pastor, &gt;&gt; right? But he pastored the Tucson Tabernacle which helped him be able to facilitate all the things that God had him do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It brought him in that position. That's why brother That's why God always Now, Brother Green wasn't perfect, but that's why God always brought a a Nathaniel Johnson and a and a brother Linhardt and uh a me uh and different ministers. I won't call anybody else's name, but uh brought in brothers to do that to be quote unquote defunct pastors to that group of people because there there they had to have a stable force of someone there tending the sheep. There had to be. But brother Green had to have the the heading of pastor to do what he did to accomplish what he accomplished. That transition had to take place not just for Tucson Tabernacle or just for Tucson or not for just for Jeffersonville which nobody else took it upon themselves to do but brother Perry Green &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and he's the one that did it and he started flying overseas and when brother Green when brother Brown was still here brother brother Green remember brother Green's testimony went to brother Brown said this brother come Galdona was it Galona He come and want to be baptized. Brother, brother brother Brown says, "We'll baptize him." Brother Green said, "Okay." So he takes him down and brother Brown, Brother Green baptizes, brother God. And now brother went back to Brother and said, "Now go preach the gospel to him." So brother Green gets on a plane and goes down to South Africa or uh South America and starts preaching to him. And off it goes. Well, then what did that do? That just lit a fire, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm saying this to try to caveat the five-fold ministry to the understanding of why God does some of the things that he does. He equips us all in different ways. There was nobody I'm sorry, friend, and I may get some push back or disagreement on this, but there was nobody when brother Brown passed away equipped to do what Perry Green did. Nobody. Everybody, &gt;&gt; it was on him and him alone. &gt;&gt; Now from him and from that time started little fires and started little pockets and started little ministries and God started working with them and started working with them and God started working with them and started still had Tucson Tabernacle still the pastor of Tucson Tabernacle. I've had a lot of people tell me he was a horrible pastor that there's a reason for that. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's a reason you feel that way. I'm not saying he was. There's a reason you feel that way. Amen. He went here and then God started dealing with these people and started dealing with those people and then you got people going and then you got other generations coming up and they said, "Wow, these got this group and these well I feel I called a missionary and so they fly over to this group and so well we just heard about it and they started distributing books and they started distributing tapes and ministers started rising up and they started sending people all over the place." Now you had and from that grew just a huge balloon of this message around the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And grew from a couple thousand probably I think or so that when brother Brandon passed away to two million people that that were professing message believers. How did that happen? Well through obviously through technology and stuff like that. You had the invention of airplanes and then you had telephones and then you know along come the internet and you had all this sudden then you could spread the gospel. Things could spread a lot faster and a lot more broad with technology. But there had to be people men brothers to use that technology to get it out. &gt;&gt; You understand? That's to get to this whole bride body internationally. And Perry Green was the one that started that. I'm sorry. He's the one that started that. &gt;&gt; That got that going. That's the reason that that is the way it is. &gt;&gt; Now, Tucson Tabernacle still exists and that's fine. That's great. That's my brothers and sisters. I love them with all my heart. Brother Dan Evans, I love him with everything I can love him with. Amen. But after brother Green passed away, the purpose of all that ministry was gone. And I've had people tell me, "Well, they're changing this and they're changing that, and the building's changing, they're doing this, and they're doing that, and it doesn't even look the same. Doesn't even feel the same. It's not supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't like it either because that was my home for 15 years. I don't like it either, but it's supposed to be that way. Brother Green's gone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It doesn't fulfill the purpose that it used to fulfill. Amen. It It's not in the position that it used to be in with Barry Green as the head of it. &gt;&gt; It's and it's never going to be the same. But it doesn't have to be the same. It's not supposed to be the same. You understand? It's not supposed to be what it was. It doesn't need to be what it was. Now, God's got these bride members and churches and ministers and pastors all over the world. And we're doing one thing. We're all getting ready for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All getting ready for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And it falls back on the five-fold ministry. Let me finish this before I before I close today. this man. Look now again my separation of I'm not a pastor, evangelist, missionary. Amen. God made me the way he made me to be a pastor. &gt;&gt; He made that other brother over here the way he made him to be an evangelist. So if you're an evangelist, don't try to be a pastor. Like we said last week, an evangelist is supposed to come in, tear the place apart, and and leave. A pastor can't do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. A pastor likes evangelism coming into his church because he likes the five-fold ministry. But a pastor understands when an evangel a true evangelist comes in anointed of God, he's going to rip the hide off your congregation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to come back in with the with the sav and make it all good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not patronize people, but bring in a pastorial spirit that helps people come into an understanding. Brother Brandham could do all that in one service, but Amen. It's just different. So it again, Brother Brandham said, "There's this guy. He's short and strong. He can pick up that bag of something and walk away with it." He said, "I'm tall and skinny. I couldn't do it. God built him for the reason he built him the way he built him. And he built me the way he built me for a reason. Because of who I am, what I'm supposed to do, what God's called me to do. That's why I am who I am. That's why I was raised in the house I was raised with the parents I have and the neighborhood I had, the friends I had, the schools I went to. It all goes down the line. It was to equip and to bring me to the place that God could use me in this capacity. Same thing with everyone just in a different capacity. &gt;&gt; You look and read brother Bam's life and see if brother Bam's life, every bit of what happened to him did bring him up to the point to do what he needed to do when God called him. &gt;&gt; Amen. every bit of it shaped him into who he was. Brother Brandham even talks about to his to his manly structure. Amen. I wasn't built to do that. So, I don't do it. I don't pick up that big bag of something and tote it over here. That's not my It's not mine to do. Amen. I'm not supposed to evangelize to you. That's not my job to do. I might rip the hide off of you once in a while, but that's just something that the word does that God gives. And that's what a pastor does. Amen. But that's not my ministry. Understand? But God made him that way for his work. Made me this way for my work. Now, we're trying to look beyond the curtain of time. Well, perhaps I'd be the one to do it. Now, what will it do? What will I do? I jump up, grab a hold. And a little short fella, he couldn't do that. He couldn't find his load. See what I mean? Maybe you preach. Maybe you're a pastor. Maybe you're a teacher. Maybe you're an evangelist. You don't see visions. I don't. He says, "I see visions." But some none of them. See, but God has set in the church all these things for the perfecting of the body. Amen. For the perfecting of the body, the bride body as a whole. &gt;&gt; That's how we come together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why this body has to come together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I've got to read this before I close. I didn't even finish second Peter, but anyway, we'll finish it later. Hebrews chapter 10. Let me read this. We're talking on the body real quick. Notice Hebrews 10:1. For the law having a shadow, I don't know if I could do this without teaching you. The law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with these sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For then would they have not ceased to be offered? Of course. Why wouldn't they still be doing it if that's what it took to be made perfect? &gt;&gt; Amen. If that's all it took to make man perfect, why did Jesus even come? &gt;&gt; Thus, we finish the reading. For then would we have not ceased to be offered? Because that the worshippers once pursed have no more conscience of sin. Let's see. They Well, let me let me go on. But in those sacrifices, there is a remembrance again made of sin um uh every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats would take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh when Christ cometh into the world, he says, "Sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not, but a body thou hast prepared for me." Praise the Lord. Let's just think about that till next week. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A body thou has prepared &gt;&gt; for me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm thankful today. Now, he had his human natural body, but I thank God I am a member of the mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A part of that body. A member of that body. Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we could. Wow. This too long. It says an hour. &gt;&gt; 10 minutes. Is that okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; God's mindful. &gt;&gt; God knows. That's why everything about this, everything about his word brings us right back around to that understanding that God's bringing us to the place that we're at today. Because we're, this bride is about to go home. I almost said ready. We're not ready or we'd be gone. Brother Brown said when this bride's ready, she'll be gone. &gt;&gt; And I'm believing that anytime, any moment. one more seed possibly. Maybe that seed is in and maturing. I don't know. It's up to God. But I believe in my spirit, in my heart, in my soul, it's it's not much longer. Can't be much longer. Amen. That God's calling us home. I I've talked about you for the past couple of weeks about this movement that's going on. I saw an interview of somebody. I think it was Pat Robert's daughter who's kind of taking up the mantle of Pat Roberts. Y'all know Pat Roberts. Robert's son. Was it Roberts or Robertson? Pat Robert Pat 700 Club Pat Robertson. Okay. Um I I saw an interview on the news. I was getting dressed in the morning going getting ready to go to work and I turned on the news and um she was doing an interview with her and she was talking about how uh how these this great they call revival coming up now in this country sweeping through. I read another article yesterday on the plane where Jenzers, which I thought Z was the end of the alphabet, but apparently I guess the next generation is alpha or something. Anyway, Gen Zer men are now flocking to churches. They're they're even Gen Z men, what I read, is now outnumbering millennial men in churches because of that because of that spirit, that wave that's going. She made the comment about the Holy Spirit and those people going to get in that that getting into that Holy Spirit. Friend, isn't that just exactly what I've been trying to get to us for two weeks about Re Matthew 25? Three weeks maybe. Matthew 25. When that foolish virgin goes after that oil, that's when the bridegroom comes. I for I I can't help it, saints. It's all in my spirit. It's in my soul. I believe that to be the day that we're living. &gt;&gt; I think we're watching it unfold right now. And it's it's it's going home time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going home time. She actually literally out of her own mouth said those almost exact words that I have said here. Now, she didn't say it in in relation to Matthew 25. She wouldn't call herself or those foolish virgin. But we know as we know the scripture, that's what's going on. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's what's happening. And it is h is sweeping this country, saints. Amen. My mind. Praise the Lord. It's like brother brother Dennis prayed. Not time to be playing church. Not time to be playing with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time to get right with the Lord Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I was going to sing this whole song, but we'll just sing the chorus here. Amen. It's I think let's see 196 You're home with the book. We probably know it though. I was going to sing the verses, but we'll just sing the chorus as we're closing our service today. Is that okay? Just praise him. Worship him again. We entered our service with praise. We ended our service lifting our hands and worship the Lord. Let's go out that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the Lamb for sinners slave. Give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each stain. Oh hallelujah. Let's sing it again. Yes, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinner's slave. Give. Oh, give him glory. All you people for his blood has washed away each day. One more time again with all our hearts now. Yes, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. Give him gloryy all ye people. For his blood has washed away each day. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for that precious blood that washed away every stain, that cleansed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Made us righteous in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. I'm so thankful that he did the work. &gt;&gt; It is finished. &gt;&gt; Now it's to the body bride internationally, the mystical body of Christ to continue this thing forward on into the coming of the Lord. A rapture, a going home time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look up. Your redemption drawth nigh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Pray something was said to bless and strengthen you today. Lord willing, if there is a next Sunday, come back again next Sunday expecting the Lord to do he always done and probably continue on this thought unless the Lord changes &gt;&gt; which I don't doubt he could do &gt;&gt; or would do but if not we just be back here same time same place I not heard I don't know we're not scheduled for next week yet so I don't know I have no idea it seems like week to week anymore I don't know where we're going next week so uh kind of make decisions at the last minute to and all arrangements and stuff at the last minute anymore to because the way the sites are going. So, I don't know, but I will let you know um what's going on. If we go back to one of the other two places we've been recently, uh I won't have to do service up, but there's no telling where we may go. So, but I will let you know what's going on in the service time and everything so that um we'll all be on top of that. See, whatever the Lord's will is. Amen. So, God richly bless you. Appreciate your prayers. Continue to pray. Remember the prayers and requests, things that we've heard today and those who've had surgeries and those who've been in situations, hospitals, the past. And of course, Cara is upcoming Wednesday. Mine's upcoming Wednesday. And just appreciate the Lord for that. He's always good to us, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.

Others that are recovering for little Alice's need, Father God, may just be with us and touch us days not take anything for granted, but always be in prayer and thanksgiving for everything that you give to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ourselves into your hands and ask everything in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
