that Lord we might be able to stand in the light that we might be Children of the light that anybody wants to come into the light they must come to you Lord oh God may you just bless us today Lord may your Holy Spirit have preeminence in the reigning part of this service we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here today you are the reason we're here Lord and we give you thanks for it God bless us now the reading of your word Lord and just speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear may it be a strength and a blessing and a help to each of us God as we look into your word once again today we Grant it uh we uh pray that you grant it now to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis chapter 2 1 verse the last verse 25 uh Genesis 2:25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed now let's go over to 37 37 which is probably on the the same page is on M yes and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves Together made themselves aprons you can be seated if you'd like something tremendously dramatic happened in just a couple of verses of scripture something tremendously in one minute uh they are naked and and they don't know it or they're naked and not ashamed it doesn't say they didn't know it it just says that they weren't ashamed right amen so uh so obviously they were living in a condition a spiritual condition that their nakedness didn't bother them it was nothing that meant uh anything to them because there was no reason to because at the time they were living in in a state of Holiness they were living in a in a in a place of uh that was holy they were living in a holy condition they were created by God Almighty so everything about it was holy and righteous and good so there was no reason for there to be any kind of uh a shame amen no shame even though they were in that condition but something happened obviously between that verse and just a few verses later where their eyes became open amen amen amen they realized that they were naked and then they were ashamed so between the 25th between 2:25 and 37 their eyes came open now what eyes because they could already see obviously they weren't blind people they they actually had natural vision so obviously a different eye came open and they realized something that they did not realize before or they recognized this they they knew that they were in this condition but before they knew if they knew they were in this condition doesn't say they didn't know in this condition they were not ashamed now knowing they're in this condition because their eyes are open they're they're ashamed they're ashamed of their nakedness now where did the shame come from because there is no shame in God right there's no shame in Holiness there's no reason to be ashamed when you serve God and live for God and if there's any shame to the the things that we do and how we live because we do what we do based on the scripture and to glorify God if there's any shame in that then it's not godly right you say well I do exactly what the Bible says I I follow the scripture I've done exactly what brother brandom said and I I I've lived this way and I've done this and I've dedicated this but if you're living in a state of Shame that's not godliness amen you're you're living in in in a uh a self uh uh self-righteous state right you you're living in a state of self-righteous you're you're not living in the righteousness of God you're living in your own righteousness you you're living in a place of of trying to make yourself something that you're not if you're ashamed to do the things that uh and and obviously i' I've known people in that condition they won't admit it at the time they don't say it but they are and they are because you one reason you get to know them in such a way or another reason is those people have left and turned back from the way they used to live right so if they're not living the way they used to live and their life was dedicated to God somehow there was there had to be some shame in the way they were living or they would still be living that way right amen amen now there's shame where did shame come from shame could not have been from God because there's no shame in God again the shame had to come from the enemy shame had to come from uh the devil shame had to come from sin the the the sin is what created the shame right the fall of nature is what created the shame amen not not God uh but the condition when their eyes were open let's read we've read this part of the scripture many many times but I want to read it over again we'll start back at the 25th uh 225 and read through to 37 they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed amen so we can only assume because it does not say that I have ever found whether they knew that they were naked at that point or not so we assume they did know it doesn't say that they did not know amen they knew but there was no shame so look so they must have been looking through a different lens uh by the way my title today is going to be going Beyond the Veil uh may actually probably be two or three parts because uh there's a multifaceted part of the veil amen uh that we but this this is where I wanted to start this Veil so there must have been a different lens that they were looking through because they weren't blind amen they could see with their eyes so what did it mean when their eyes were open it had to be something different than their natural eye amen because they could see so they could see obviously they could see one another unclothed they could see one another naked but it didn't mean anything to them there was no shame because they were looking through a different lens they were looking through a holy lens they were looking through a holy Veil God had them veiled even though they were naked God had them veiled not on their bodies but their eyes right the veil was on the eye not on the body amen a a woman when she gets married she'll wear a veil over her face amen and it should be I don't know how often this happens anymore but it should be that when the man lifts that woman's Veil that's the first time he's ever kissed her right amen that's way it's supposed to be um I me nor me or my wife were living for the Lord so we did KISS before we got married but it's supposed to be and again how many times this happens I don't know that that's the first time the veil is lifted amen when the veil gets lifted there's an exposure and that opens up the Avenue now what is it it opens up the expression of the man and the woman now being one flesh gives him by God permission to be able to engage in an activity that they could not should not have engaged in Prior legally scripturally amen so that Veil when that veil was lifted it created something amen when this veil was there it wasn't over their bodies but it was over their eyes God had a holy Veil over their eyes so what they saw was to a different lens amen oh H how uh how I would love uh to be looking through that lens today how about you Amen brother brandom would not had to put a cross in his car if that if if we were looking through that lens amen amen but since the fall amen it created a a different lens amen a different Veil if you will it wasn't a holy Veil anymore when they fail it was a lust Veil it was a demonic lust Veil that then came over their eyes and then when they looked it was not just a look to say oh you're naked it was a lustful condition that was created by the lifting of that Veil right amen now let's let's move on they were both naked the man his wife and were not ashamed um kind of glad the kids aren't in this for this part but uh we'll move on from this now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and we know as we've said many times that means uh cunning crafty uh uh deceiving beguiling it also means sensible uh as as we've said several times we understand when you look up subtle in the Hebrew uh a context of that is sensible what he gave to Eve made sense Amen to her when he offered it to her it made sense to her as it was it was as sensible as it was beguiling as it was deceiving amen then any beast of the field which the Lord God had made he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and again as you said he's questioning the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the Garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden no explanation needed with amongst us adults to understand midst middle of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she die okay now we've got another situation arose when God said ye shall die he did not mean that they would physically die right there right he meant that there would be a separation now you look at a lot of people uh look and they play with the words uh but you you can take the word die and you can make it several meanings um uh you can mean physically death uh a person could say oh uh my boyfriend broke up with me and I just died inside well they were still living I was in such love with him that I died inside when he left me amen what does that mean well it means something to that person because they're the ones who gave it their their death not physical still breathing still alive meant something to her on the inside right amen praise the Lord I died I I remember oh this may sound awful carnal I'm very sorry for this but when I was in high school there was a song that came out and a lyric of that song cuz when I was in high school I listen to that music uh that a song came out and one of the the lyrics of that song you see how powerful music is I mean from uh 40 what was it 41 years now I've been graduated anyway uh over 40 years but a but a lyric of that song said I died in your arms tonight now that doesn't mean that that man that person literally physically lost his breath in that woman's arms that's not what it means right amen but you understand the different uh application of that same word right oh I just died inside oh he he died yesterday um uh you could even say I died my hair but that's actually uh spelled a different way but you understand what I'm saying when God said when you eat of that fruit ye shall touch it neither shall you eat it or touch it lest you die amen now this is what the the serpent came back to her with and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now they're talking about two different things but he's he's deceived her to the point that she doesn't realize that amen amen he's deceived her to the point see he that Veil is still there but he's questioning the Integrity of not only Adam but of what God literally said amen the day you eat the day you touch that day you're going to die and he comes back and says you shall not surely die God and what she's replicating said that you're going to die what a separation from God right amen amen a separation that and that's what we know as brother ROMs taught us that that death that spiritual if you will death is a separation from God if you are separated from God my friend you are dead yes period I don't care how alive you are I don't how good a shape you're in I don't care how much breath you draw how great a pulse you have if you are separated from God you are dead dead spiritually dead now he comes along and says you will not surely die what's he telling her he's telling her you are not going to physically die but what is Sheil see so they're talking in two different ways of the word die but he's got her so with that Veil so convinced so beguiled so deceived now that she doesn't recognize what he said the the difference the kindness of the enemy knows exactly what he's talking about where to go how to do again he knows the weakest spots that we have where to hit he's got that Punch Coming amen we know that but she doesn't recognize and and we can get into the the byproduct and from Adam and uh woman all if you want I'm just going to skip over that I don't think that needs to be uh uh iterated here today but recognizing who the Serpent's working with he didn't go to Adam amen serpent didn't go to Adam he knew better he went to Eve right because he knew he could get in that feminist spirit in that condition I condition as woman he knew he could make inroads with her because she was not of the original creation she is a byproduct right she was from man one man and being that byproduct he knew that he could get in to deceive her in a way he could not get to Adam in fact the scripture even says after the fall in first Timothy after all that that that the Bible itself says that Adam was not deceived even in the fall right even when he went in and partook of it from her with her the Bible says he was not deceived right so if he wasn't deceived then you understand that makes that makes it really clear why the serpent did not go to Adam he went to Eve because he found a vessel he could work in brother bandam said she wandered away from the word Adam which was the word to her she wandered way and the serpent found her alone that's how he was able to talk to her and convince her and beguile her this way it's because he found her alone right and again the worst condition that anybody could be in Saints is away from God yes when you're alone away from the word when you separated yourself from the truth of God's word the Holy Spirit and reading and praying when you've separated yourself and a and you're away from God your defenses are let down and you're wide open for anything that the devil would bring to you male or female amen because remember this is after the fall now then you're open to anything anything that could be something that uh uh even a a hybridation of God's word from another Minister yes or just flat out demonic lies yes whatever it might be if you're away from God if your life's not fortified with God when you get away from the word you're fair game for the devil yes and she was fair game for the devil and the devil was able the serpent the devil the serpent the devil through the serpent was able to beguile her to the point that he's talking to her in a way that she doesn't recognize he she believes what he's saying because of the veil that he's presented to her amen again a veil of Flesh but now look the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die God is telling her and talking spiritual amen because everything was spiritual then there there was not a necessity if you will of even considering to think about or worry about the flesh right God took care of everything he created Adam and and all the botney life and the and the uh animal life and God made the sun he made the moon he made the waters he made God took care of everything right amen so there was there was not a need of all these things it was a place of a Utopia it was a place of perfection it was a place of Holiness all the things that we think about worry about most all the things that that come to our minds during the day time was at did didn't mean anything to them it never came came to his mind wasn't necessary one day it won't be necessary again but it wasn't necessary because sin had not entered in amen the blip of time had not entered in they were living in a place of perfection eternity amen but now when when she heard this you shall not surely die he's talking about well you're not going to lose your breath you're not going to fall on the ground and die die is and no longer be alive but look what she look how he's convinced her now for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof now it sounds like the exact same thing isn't this that it's the same old devil you know the devil is just as quick and just as happy to deceive you with the word as he is anything else right the devil would just assume and actually I don't know that he would wouldn't prefer deceiving you with the word than to see you in a bar down here somewhere smoking a cigarette and drinking Li liquor that's true I I believe that anyway amen amen I believe the devil would just as soon get you off the word then have you down there amen that's the truth oh God yeah that's right the deception of the word it's always been his practice look how he look how he went to Jesus look how he came to Jesus in Matthew what did he do he used the word he tried to deceive the word with the word exact same thing he did to Eve here now if he had come to Adam with that same stuff Adam would have did the same thing Jesus did right but she was in a position to be deceived and notice he's trying to use the word against her right all isn't that the truth today we talk about the the the the lifting up and this you talk about a Rejuvenation you know back years ago when we've always known because because the prophet told us and we can see it in the scripture uh how this was going to unfold and who was going to be behind it all and who was in charge of it we know who the Beast is we know what the Beast is going to be writing amen so if we know that a few several years ago we're like wow that that that whole organization is just flattened out and the the U ridicule and the the U Scandal they had of the molestation of these boys and stuff and all that thing happened and I remember walking in when we right after we first moved to Tucson and uh my barber who just retired my old Barber he was in there and he was working with in his brother's shop and uh we walked in to an appointment he was going to cut my hair and they had their mother sitting in one of the barber chairs him and his brother and they were pleading with her and they were talking to her and she was crying and and I talked to him L said what are what what is the problem and she was so distraught about the Catholic church because they're real heavy Catholics she was so distraught over the Catholic church and all that had been going on in the church and all the proven at that time had come out hundreds if not thousands of molestation charges and all that that came forth and it just tore her apart it broke her heart and they were trying to sit there and reason with her and talk to her and calm her down and I tell you what friend she wasn't having any of it now she stayed as far as I know according to my barber she stayed a Catholic till she died that's not whatever uh but I just remember that time amen and you think back there and and think my how is this this is this Pope is supposed to be is the Beast and this church is supposed to be the most powerful richest uh entity on the earth that he's riding on the most powerful most influential and you look today and you look around and you see uh the prayer apps is coming out amen you ever heard you ever seen that prayer they have an app now that's a Prayer app uh I don't know much about it don't have it on my phone uh but I do know that the prayers end with father son the Holy Ghost amen they don't they don't they don't say in Jesus Christ's name that that that all in and it's what is it it's a it's a Catholic driven thing right uh you see like I said this new series or movie or whatever it is has come out about Saints and it's supposed to be this great popular thing it's this whole movement friend I want you seed the seed of Satan this whole thing is has regenerated a movement and is and is sweeping across the world not just the country but sweeping across the world today and taking over people again to where people are falling right be right back into that same machine that a lot of people probably came out of or quit right it's the same thing amen it's one of those veils we'll talk about it's one of those veils and people are coming right back to it again it's the same thing it's the same deception right exact same thing Satan's doing right here through the serpent to eeve exact same thing God doth know how dare you preach the word of God to me you devil amen I mean saying sometimes we just need to get a little bold with it to understand this is just a product of the devil amen how dare you speak to me you devil how dare you try to preach or give me the word you devil amen there's nothing but deception and lies in there I don't care how much of it is true you know if this from hell it is of the devil it is wrong amen that's right and it purpose is to send you to the same place it came from yes amen God doth know that in that day ye eat thereof then your eyes now he's talking about eyes then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil amen now was he right in the context he was speaking on that Veil amen he was right Adam and Eve Adam and at the time the woman traded this this holy Veil because he he came let let's just read the six verse when the woman saw that the tree was good for food amen she enjoyed it quite lustful then there was pleasant to the eye a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof did eat gave also her husband with her and he did eat they traded this holy Veil that God had been veiled with where they were there in front of each other and were not ashamed they traded that for shame they both did now Adam was not deceived amen the woman was deceived according to the scripture she was deceived he was not right but they both partook and we know why of course brother randam explains and him playing the part of Christ there standing in the Gap and taking our sins he took her sins CU God knew that if he took her then he would have to take him to and he wasn't going to destroy Adam right amen Adam was his uh was his son he was his created son he wasn't going to kill Adam Adam came from him he was a part of him amen she came from Adam but Adam came from God right God wasn't going to destroy Adam well now that she uh he is in the same condition she is he can't destroy her without destroying him right praise the Lord now as he did at Calvary God cannot destroy this this horrible Wicked and adulterous generation Gentile without hurting him that's why we have a bride amen he can't destroy us without destroying him because he became us so we can become him praise the Lord now he can't destroy us without destroying him horrible as we were as probably horrible as we are still as hum uh he can't destroy us without destroying him he paid the price it is finished we got to remember that Saints it is finished your healing amen is finished her healing sister sheilia is finished amen salvation finished paid for done amen all the righteousness Holiness all all that you need of the goodness all that you need positive and right rightous it's all been paid for every bit of it it's done all we have to do is step into it and receive it praise the Lord we're going to have Christmas here pretty soon it's going to be exchanging of gifts I challenge anybody here and all the gifts that you get to take them and just put them in the garbage Nobody Does that right why would anybody do that amen you said well sometimes I throw some stuff in the garbage not before you open it you at least open it I'm talking about just taking them no matter how big small just dump them in the garbage just take them to the Landfield don't even look don't care oh it's from my wife doesn't matter don't garbage doesn't matter my son daughter no it's garbage see if we don't even want try to unwrap the gift to expose what it is to accept it to use it to let it become a part of our lives and what does it mean right it's just garbage amen but it's a gift that God give us to the world it may be garbage but to us it's a gift a precious gift praise the Lord and God still can put that that still precious not not as it was in the Garden of Eden that Holy Veil over this bride amen we're still humans we still live in this world we still go through this and the sticky flesh but God can still as he puts that Holy Veil because you know what we are as we know the bride of Christ amen and what does the bride wear a veil what does she do she veils herself from the rest of the world amen amen when that ring is slipped on that finger and that and that uh promise is made that vow is made and that ring is slipped on the veil lifts up amen because Heaven and Earth embraced Heaven and Earth Kiss brother R said kiss amen can't kiss unless the veils lifted remember veils got to be lifted for there's a kiss amen Heaven and Earth Kiss one another that's Christ God his bride together amen coming together again as one with that Holy Veil praise the Lord amen holy Veil Veil to the rest of the world Amen revealed to God because God knows who we are now this Veil now this that's why that we as as as uh as I I think about moving this forward we receive that Holy Veil again amen I I know we're humans I I know that lust Veil still there in this flesh but I'm not talking about the flesh anymore uh the the day you eat thereof is the day you die that's what God Said serpent said You shall not die but the serpent was talking about a physical death God was talking about a spiritual death right but to the bride there is no such thing as a spiritual death right there's no such thing as a spiritual death doesn't exist to her praise God that's why the Bible John says he that is of god God cannot sin he that is born of God cannot sin amen praise the Lord man if you if you took this to a Baptist Church friend these people be walking out on you oh my but there's got to be the holy Veil over the bride yes amen because she's veiled herself God has veiled her amen for the rest of the world we got to look be we we have to look beyond that human Veil yes we've got to go beyond that flesh Veil we've got to go past that that lust Veil amen for that to to be clothed in that Holy Veil yes amen of the righteousness of Jesus Christ praise the lord we got to go beyond that people today even in the Garden of Eden they tried to put on a veil amen notice seventh verse again their eyes were open amen praise the Lord and I will say as I've said many times as brother random said as I've heard other ministers say if it took an apple to open their eyes to their nakedness list pass the apples again amen it took apricot if it took an orange if it took a tangelo I don't care a lemon whatever it took a pomegranate whatever it took whatever it was that fruit that they claimed that they picked off a tree or a bush if that is what caused them to see their nakedness it's time to pull them again yes it's time to pass them around by the millions billions amen it's time to pass them around again amen but the Bible says that this day that we live they would be poor miserable blind wretched naked and not know it why because of the lust Veil amen the lust Veil now they've got a veil over them that they look and are not ashamed anymore they're not ashamed anymore they walk around today and it means nothing to them now amen no more shame right praise the Lord why because I it it's like it's like brother bandam said a sinner can't sin you think how that doesn't make any sense at all he can't sin because that's who he is amen he can't sin because he's a uh because he's a sinner that's just who he is right amen he's just being who he is praise the lord well it's the same thing they're just being who they are praise the Lord so there's no shame here there was some godliness now there is none that I imagine I I I don't know don't go to them haven't seen it but I imagine that they probably will walk into the churches around the world today dressed like that right SK clothed so tight look like a skin down wiener showing every lump bump hump everywhere you can find well what godliness what Holiness is there to that right my talk about imagination it's a lust Veil amen the creator of that is the devil and he did it to deceive the men's the the sons of God to throw them off to bring that lust Veil into Play Amen so that it thrust them into hell too the whole point of it that's why brother BR said that was that's the Satan's the one that designed it he designed it that way amen amen praise the Lord but now they tried to put a veil their eyes were open they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons they tried to Veil themselves again where not the eyes now the holy veil's been lifted the holy veil was lifted when they sinned and sin entered into the camp and when the Holy veil was lifted all they could see was The Shame of the naked so they tried to sew fig leaves together now this is before God comes down notice this is is before they tried sewing fig leaves together even before God tried to come down in the cool of the day to fellowship with him again like he had done every single day they tried doing that even before God when God came down and begin to speak looking for Adam that's when they hid in the trees in the bushes amen amen another Veil that they tried to use amen they tried to Veil themselves with these fig leaves man-made ecclesiastical figes hoping thinking that would hide their nakedness so that they would be okay now Adam knew that it wouldn't but what else Choice did he have right amen amen look so many veils they still and people still try to do the same thing today people still try to Veil themselves to make themselves feel okay and look okay and think worry about it once a year maybe not at all maybe go to church once a year I know my wife used to tell me that or she has said many times before that her family when she was growing up they were really good solid Easter and Christmas Christians if any other time they they were in church on Easter and they were in church on Christmas amen there were good solid Easter Christmas Christians that's what they were I'm assuming hopefully uh because I didn't see it happen they didn't self-combust when we got married into church and they had to come on a day that wasn't Easter Christmas but they were still alive when we left but there's so many of these people that are like that right that they are that that is their Veil their religion and I don't mean to say anything bad but it's kind of like the lady that Sonia takes care of even too with the uh K she's very devout to her church and I mean she's she's a she's a good lady and right there with her church and uh she falls right in line with the with the whole deal all that all that encompasses amen and then God bless her I mean at least she's solid a lot of people are more Wishy was she don't know what's ways out they don't know what they're doing the next day but they take this as all it is is a veil people Veil themselves all the time and think oh this I'm this I'm fine I'll be good you know if death strikes me today I'll be okay and it's got to the place if you listen to what's going on in the world today especially this country that like everything is acceptable anymore I mean if you're this side of Jeffrey dmer and Hitler you're going to go to heaven you don't have to be too far this side of Hitler but as long as you're on this side you're going to go to heaven you you slip over a little bit into the Jeffrey dber or Hitler or something then you know there's no hope for you you're you're Hell Bound but it's like everybody goes to heaven now it no matter how they lived how they conducted themselves right anything profess anything it's but what it is they use these veils people use their uh churches a veil well I go to a random tab tacle or I go to word of God Tabernacle I go to Tucson Tabernacle that's and they use that as a veil or or or the pastor amen yeah brother brandom or or Perry green or uh I won't mention anybody else's name you know as a veil that's that's their Veil oh I I I'm a message believer oh that's fine in Dandy friend the devil believes it too right amen amen he knows know it he knows it's the truth so much he fights tooth and nail to get you out of it right away from it brother Dennis prayed it in the prayer brother brandom said all hell is against this teaching and we know it is and those those minions have been coming out rising out of the pits of hell ever s and they come full force and now that so many of these oldtimers are passing away that were there that saw and part of it and documented and all those give eyewitnesses of all passing away it get it's going to get harder and harder it's going to press harder and harder amen you never saw it before uh uh all the different Old-Timers started passing away like brother green brother mugh that we know here local started Billy Paul started passing away you didn't you didn't see the wholesale these people leaving amen it's been going on for a few years now but it it it took it took 40 plus years of brother brand it took a whole generation basically once that generation unfolded uh from from Brother bram's passing that 40-year generation unfolded after that is when it just that that generation unfolded it just started people just started going away oh I don't believe that that didn't happen that's not documented amen well how do you know were you there well it's not recorded anywhere that doesn't mean didn't happen right you know a lot of times especially back in that late of a day that late that long ago things weren't recorded sometimes a lot of times people knew what they knew because they talked to each other right amen wow did you you were you there when that bridge fell I saw those men come and fell right into that concrete fell to their death they just kept on for it amen well was the paper there I don't know I don't care whether's whether there's an article add about it doesn't make any difference to me at all amen first of all I believe brother brandom and every other thing so why don't I believe him with that whether there's an article that says it was or not amen and even if I don't has nothing to do with my salvation whatsoever yes amen nothing the bridge falling and those men going in have nothing to do you notice and see all the attacks that people have and these are veils by the way that we're talking about all these things that people come against to talk about it usually in fact almost never has anything to do with the word right and the message of what he preached amen they hit his maybe brother Ram's personal opinions on things and sometimes you got weigh the personal opinion based on the fact that he preached in 1940 or 1950 which is whole different this is a whole different world then amen or they they judge him based on uh of uh some fact that was wrong or something okay I don't care what I care about is the word and what I see in the word is what he preached in this word is 100% that's what's going to put dress me and put me in a Rapture as a bride of Jesus Christ not the stories stories are good I like them I believe them amen but you notice that when they hit that's what they talk about yes amen that's neither here or there but you see that's just a veil and people use those veils see if that but if somebody comes along if they use brother brandom as their Veil and somebody comes along it kind of rips that away from them what do they have they they're safety net has been pulled out from under them what happens when that preacher Falls or that church folds what happens in what where does your Veil go people use religion as their Veil how many times people talk about well he's not very religious praise God I'm glad amen people talk sometimes at work about oh he's religious I said no I'm not religious now people think something different about that but then I go on and explain it see understand religion is just a covering all religion is something to make you feel good it's a veil it's a veil to try to make a person feel good to think I go to church Easter Christmas I I I I give a little money in and uh I I shake hands with the pastor so I'm good Peter open those Gates this what they believe anyway you have songs about Peter open in the perfect Gates Peter's got the role and he's he's he's like the major D at a restaurant is your name you have a reservation I don't see your name on the list you sure you made the reservation for what time did you make the reservation that that's how they they have Peter he's like got the Ducktails and the white coat and he's you know making sure that only the people that's only on open the gate amen you see how s aized against that people use that that's what that's what denomination creates amen religion some people use their self-righteousness as their own religion amen I I it's actually even come out to some people that claim to be Christians say they're their own God you you are your own God self-righteous piety right amen I'm so good there's no way God could refuse me my veil is me amen if your Veil is you you're in sad shape my friend amen me included we are a sad people if our Veil is us yes amen family people use their family as veils amen well my my my my great great granddaddy was a Baptist my great granddaddy was a Baptist my granddaddy was a my daddy was a b I'll die Baptist well you'll die all right amen that's your Veil yep that's how you'll die why can't we think for ourselves we are free moral agents after all yes we do have the opportunity to actually make up our own minds how we want to live what we want to believe amen amen we train our children in the way that we want them to go but it's up to them to decide which way they want to choose to go amen I believe if you've taught him right and you've taught him by the scripture that will not depart from them because that's the word right amen but that is that is a holy Veil that is a that is a a Holiness that is over that person will be over that person their whole lives not not a veil now now you can't offer them a veil say well we raised them in church well what church did you raise them in did you did you uh ra him in a a place that doesn't even preach the word of God or doesn't believe in a standard of living or doesn't believe in a standard of Holiness of any kind I mean you know if if you raise them in the word that's one thing right if you raise them in church that's another thing amen there's a difference people still hiding in those veils hiding behind those veils a veil a veil is something a thing that covers a veil is something that conceals a veil is also something that disguises according to the dictionary according to uh uh the meanings a veil is also something that disguises it brings a disguise to make something look like something that it's not amen kind of like the little kitties do or not our kitties hopefully but uh worldly kitties do on Halloween they wear guys amen because they want to go look like something that they're not pretend they're something that they're not amen that's the same thing a veil can disguise bring a disguise I want to read this quote here I got one more scripture I want to read and then I'm going to close because there's several other parts of this probably but um Satan's Eden 1965 notice how much alike man how much alike man and his wife now notice man and wife both naked in the Garden of Eden uh God's eeden now I'm going to close it I'm going to um hold just a few more more minutes compare this now how much alike that man and his wife both in God's Eden without One S of clothes on them and knew it not now he says they didn't know it um I think if I'm looking at you how how would I not know I I I would know because I'm looking at you now I don't realize the nakedness to the part of shame or or recognize it because it's because there's a holy Veil um the the nakedness the nakedness and know it not is today amen with no shame right for why didn't they know it for they were veiled to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit they could look right at each other and didn't know that they was naked they were veiled with the Holy Spirit of Holiness they were veiled God's Veil yet today can look and not lust they turn their head it's a holy Veil holy Veil amen God U had their eyes they were both one uh one was man the other was woman didn't know they they could because the Holiness of God kept their eyes veiled the spiritual part of their of their eye amen it's like Gaza which we may talk about later I'm not sure I haven't gotten that far but it's like Gesa uh Gesa could see just like you and me but when uh when the prophet came and said God uh it said what are you worried about young man there's more with us than there are with them right he couldn't see them what did what did he what did he ask God to do for the man for Gaz he said God open his eyes and when God opened his eyes what' he see he saw chariots and angels and Chariots of Fire All Surrounded all around about them amen amen but one of the unique Parts about that story is even with all the it gives Comfort but none of none of all the angels and Chariots of Fire and flaming swords drawn they marched down there and God just blinded their eyes so he opened gaza's eyes to see all the Chariots and angels and fire and angels and when the enemy come in they he blinded their eyes amen y praise the they could still see but they didn't recognize amen God lifted the veil off the Gaze and put the veil on them so they became blind to what was there what was what was actually standing in front of them right the Holiness of God the Holiness of God listen to this now the Holiness of God kept their eyes Veil a spiritual Veil not not a natural Veil as we talked about with the bride a spiritual Veil spiritual Veil notice a holy Veil uh God hid their conscience from sin by the holy Veil he said wish we had time on that but look here for he the worshipper once purged was no more conscience of sin sin is passed from him passed from Death unto life amen I said I was going to read this one more scripture over in Daniel I'll probably I'll to make this short Daniel chapter 3 amen Daniel chapter 3 uh let's see I was going to kind of read more than I was uh let's start with U let's start with with verse 14 Daniel 3:14 talking about three Hebrew children their denial to bow down to the golden image which we know is Daniel that Nebuchadnezzar commanded everybody there in his kingdom to bow down to this image to worship this in right Shadrach Meshach vindo would not do it amen so we pick up the story uh 14th verse Nebuchadnezzar let's start with 13 then Nebuchadnezzar we got to the plag they would not b bow down so we pick up there then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and abedo then they were brought then they uh brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true old Shadrach meach and Abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet the flute harp sackbut Sury and damer and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if ye worship not you shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands Shadrach Meshach and Indigo answered and said oh keing oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter in fact we've had we've taken this under very cons strong consideration we're not giving this or saying this to you lightly we understand we understand the consequences amen if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will Deliver Us out of thine hand out of your hand oh King amen but if not but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up amen then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Vis Visage was uh changed against Shadrach Meshach and abedo therefore because these were good men these were men that he had put in a a place of stature position I this is like a captain in the Army this is not just a flunkies that you just don't care about he cared about them that's why he give them a chance to understand you serve me you you worship the god I worship with golden image that i' made who is going to withstand you against me they said the god that we serve will amen and even if he doesn't we're not bound down to your image that's why he got upset he's full of Fury and his Visage changed because these were good men he didn't want to do this but he already made a decree changed against Shadrach meach and abedo therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than uh uh then was want to be heed and he commanded the most most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach meach and abedo and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hos and their hats and their and other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach mesach and abedo the men that took them up to throw into the furnace were burned up they didn't go in the furnace but the furnace was so hot and they were in such haste to throw them in there that they got burned up just standing on the outside that's pretty hot furnace these three men shadra Meo fell down bound into the midst of the fire burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true Old King he answered and said lo oh I love this lo I see four men praise God am I see four men and they're not bound they're loose praise God and they're walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt the fire hasn't touched them it killed the men that threw them in but it hasn't touched them right praise the Lord and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God praise the Lord amen they understood there that Veil that was there amen that allowed God he was in with them walking around in the furnace I would just have loved to know what they were talking about as they were walking around in the furnace oh my mind it just just to think about it is is inconceivable U what would I have done how would I have acted amen when they threw you in the furnace you had no hurt you were not bound anymore and God is standing there walking around with you amen you talk about a jubilee you you talk about what we call a Revival even though that's not a Revival but you know people equate the celebration and worship as Revival uh you imagine I can only imagine what Nebuchadnezzar was watching but now listen it get gets even better then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach mesach and abedo ye Servants of the most high God he's changed his tone a little bit had ye Servants of the most high God come forth and come hither then Shadrach mhach and abedo came forth of the midst of the fire and the princes uh where the four the fourth went out as quick as he came in I'm assuming and the princes Governors captains Kings counselors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was a hair on their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire on them amen praise the Lord Lord I've gone camping a lot in my life friend and I love sitting around a campfire and talking and fellowshipping and being with brothers and and and all but it has never been one time and I can set from here to the first row away from that fire there has not been one time I've ever been to a campfire 10 feet away from the fire that I didn't come away smelling like smoke every time not one time as it fa not one time have I Come Away not smelling like smoke these men didn't even smell like smoke hallelujah praise God it was as if though it never happened praise the it as if though they were never in the furnace it was they had a veil around them they had a protection they had God the
