[music] Brother Danny texted me this morning said his foot's been hurting and u still hurt him this morning. So please remember him in prayer. He's going to stay home and watch. So if you're watching Danny, [music] our prayers are with you, my brother. Amen. So please remember him in prayer. Uh, also my I found out this week that uh my last living [music] aunt or uncle passed away. Uh, actually when I got home Sunday, it was been a week ago today, she passed away. [music] Um, on Facebook's with my with her only child, my cousin Karen. And, uh, she put on Facebook that she had passed away. um 89 years old. My dad's sister, last uh the last living a or uncle I had. Uh but u so thankful me and Michael got to go visit her a few times when I was going back and forth to see my mom. Amen. And spend some time with her. I was able to stop when we went up in the mountains and minister for brother Nol's pastor, brother Joe Green, in the church there. uh she lived in that town and uh we uh we got to go visit her uh when we went up there, but she moved to a different town away from there. So, I hadn't been able to see her since, but she did pass away. Uh so, please remember the family in prayer. Uh the Lord would just comfort them and bless them. I know Karen's taking it very hard. Karen is a little younger than me. She's in our think early mid-50s. Uh my aunt Joe was 89. A lot like my grandmother and my mom actually. Uh picture health for whole her whole life. Hardly ever went to a doctor. My grandmother hardly ever ever went to a doctor. My mom didn't ever ever hardly ever go to a doctor until she had a stroke. And then uh and then that happened. And my uh my aunt Joe up till a couple years ago, Karen said that she's preacher of health. Never even went to a doctor or anything. we found out she had a a bad heart valve and here two years later then she uh she passed away. So uh I appreciate your prayers for that. Amen. those who aren't here today. Pats of course got a good a good uh if you're watching uh brother and sister Pat, God bless you. But uh got a good report I felt from brother Pat. We had lunch together, me, him, and brother Dennis Thursday. Uh brother Pat said sister Pat's doing a lot better. She's even walking around the house without a walker now even. So still still difficult for them to get up early earlier on a Sunday to get ready to be here in time. Uh so uh they may still probably but we're hoping to see them some more. Sister Pat even talked about hoping to try to get back to church. So we miss them so very much and hope they're able to do that. So please I was so encouraged by that. Amen. So please remember them. So good to see sister Julie here. Amen. God bless you sister. And of course remember prayer too. And Anna and Steve as sister Norman told us the other week that they'll be gone the rest of the year uh till the first of the year. So welcome to December. It's the last month in the year. So, amen. Uh, we uh pretty close to knocking on the door of another year. It's hard to believe, but here we are again. So, appreciate the Lord's goodness. Anyone have a request on your heart? That's all I have here. Does anyone have anything on your heart like mention? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. Thank the Lord for his goodness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He is good, brother. That is for sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Anyone else? Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. So, let's remember Amanda prayer the surgery that she talked about last week and came on the text that we sent out. So, please remember her. Anyone have an unspoken request? Lord knows all our hearts today. Let's stand to our feet if we could appreciate the Lord's goodness and blessing. Amen. Ask brother Dennis if he would take us pray. Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads, we bow in respect and love towards you, Father. For it's a privilege to once again be in your house of prayer, a house of worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that you dwell in the praises of your people. &gt;&gt; If there's a time to rejoice and praise you, it's right now, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give us Amen. that ability, that desire to do your what is required of a true Christian to pray, to worship, to love one another. Father, we know that the enemy is fighting us harder than ever because he knows that the sands of that hourglass is running out. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; and Lord, it's time THAT WE WAKE UP. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Or we're going to miss it. We're going to put forth uh halfway half sp uh effort in serving you. We're going to find ourselves in that great tribulation. &gt;&gt; It's time to put you first. I heard your prophet your say on a message that we have to give our all to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus wants to use us in the way he's called us. If you whistle, good, give that to the Lord. If you um have a desire just to clean the church and and be a help to the believers, give that to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; help us to do what you have called us to do. Be humble in our spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You dwell in the hearts of the humble. And them that are proud, you reject them. And if they don't repent, they're headed to that uh judgment of the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we want to be sincere in our walk with you. &gt;&gt; As I said before, brother Brown was asked, "How do I grow deeper in the love of God?" And he just told him, so simple, read your Bible and pray. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, if there's A TIME TO PRAY, IT'S RIGHT NOW. GOD, &gt;&gt; you went to your disciples one time and asked Peter, could you pray with me for one hour? &gt;&gt; And then you said these words, "Father, I know the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; give us the overcoming power to DIE TO THE FLESH, die to ourselves, and have a stronger PRAYER LIFE. THERE'S POWER IN THE NAME OF JESUS. WE HAVE TO recognize that when Satan comes in like a flood, you have raised that standard. Greater he is in us than he is in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; God be with us. Who can be against us. Oh Lord, there's several prayer requests this morning. Our precious brethren that need a healing touch. Brother Danny suffering with that pain from the surgery that he went through. Father, &gt;&gt; and brother Newton's aunt Joe that's gone to be with you, Father. The his cousin Karen is going through a hard time losing her mom. Oh Lord, and all the other ones that are sick. I can't remember them, but it's not important. What's important that you heard him request has been metus Lord we call thee on the scene to meet you every need according to your riches and glory &gt;&gt; for thou are a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Thank you God. &gt;&gt; And with your strip you are healed. We are are a a family THAT AS WE STAND on your word we believe in your spirit. We believe in in your power. We're are more than conquerors to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, bless our pastor as he labors faithfully to bring forth your word. &gt;&gt; Use it to speak to our hearts, Father. &gt;&gt; May your word fall upon our hearts on good ground that we may truly grow in the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ.

U so pray that uh [music] Lord just bless us now from his glory. I felt since uh we were going to be gone the next two Sundays that uh have a couple of songs that were sort of a u I guess you could say Christmas like maybe. Amen. But this song has been on my heart for a little bit. I sometimes shun from singing it because it's a it's [music] can be quite complicated to sing especially for my limited voice range.

Sister, &gt;&gt; I just want to thank everybody for their prayers. I was so nauseous last Sunday. It started Friday or Saturday and lasted until Thursday.

Uh but we're just going to go over to Ephesians and read there and uh forego the scripture reading from uh Romans 8. We'll just start in Ephesians today. Amen. So we'll go go to Ephesians chapter 4. We're just going to read a couple of verses like we did last week. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; uh verses uh 11 123. Amen. We're going to talk about prophets today and probably won't get done with it today, but uh the the prophets probably actually even more extensive, I guess, than than the apostles that we had last week. Uh and probably more so than any of the others. So, but uh we'll get into that. Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer if we could. Lord Jesus, again, we're very thankful, Father, of your blessings, your love to us. So thankful, Father, the testimonies, Lord. So thankful of what you're doing in our lives. As Art said, you are so good, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're so good to us, Lord. As Julie said, you are our healer, Father. We know that you're our healer. And as Sister Norman, Brother Dennis said, God, we need more of you. More and more of you. But Lord, we got to understand the way that we get more of you is to give more of ourselves to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God. and relinquish ourselves, our ideas, thoughts, opinions, feelings. God, just give it all into your hands, Lord. That's how we grow closer to you. That's how we become more like you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Want to get closer to God? Read your Bible and pray, Lord, and help us to be able to do that, Lord, and to reveal it to us, to show to us, God, in that place that we want to be, that we need to get to, Lord. It's in our lives, God. It's in our hearts. It's our desire, God, to serve you, to live for you, Father. We know that your coming is imminent, Lord. We know, God, that cup of iniquity has got to be reaching the brim. That that that doomsday clock, it's got to be close to midnight, Lord. God, we're just looking for our loved ones to appear at any time, Lord, for those loved ones to come forth, Lord, and show themselves, God, just entering into that place of rapture, Lord. God, let us enter into that atmosphere of rapture. Father, even in this service today, as you come, Lord, as you are here, Lord, to en rapture us into your word, Lord, into your spirit, reveal to us in that what you'd have us to see and know, God. Lord, speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear, God, and shut it to anything that would not be according to your perfect will to be said today, God. And may you anoint our ears. May we receive that word, Lord, and not return void, God, but accomplish in each of us that you sent it forth for. We commit ourselves to you. Ask your blessings on the remaining part of this service, Lord, now and speak to us, Father, I pray, from your word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] Ephesians chapter 4, just read 1121 13. Let you be seated now. And he gave some apostles and some prophets, some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. The [snorts] second one here as uh we just read we went into the apostilhip last week or uh um missionaries as was called. We recognize a missionary apostle being the same thing. The definition of those two terms is uh rings the same one cent. But the second part of this that we want to give we're just following along the lines of apostles now prophets. Uh the prophet uh the prophet ministry is probably one of the most if not the most misunderstood offices of these five. Amen. There's of course the spiritual gifts that we know in 1 Corinthians 12. But as far as the five-fold ministry goes, that prophet is probably again I believe is the most misunderstood of of all of those five uh that five-fold ministry. Uh a lot of times people get uh the prophecy of the thing. Well, most of the time what what happens is people get the gift of prophecy and a prophet uh mixed up. Uh they get they think because somebody may have a gift of prophecy does not mean they have uh uh that they are a prophet is in the sense of being a word prophet or a ministering prophet. Right? um that brother Random breaks it down into a c in two categories which we're doing right now which it basically is in two different categories but uh but I I I almost I I put a subcategory in that category because there's uh there's a gift of prophecy which we'll probably get to when we go through the gifts but there's a gift of prophecy that can fall on anybody at any time. Right. &gt;&gt; That gift of prophecy uh could follow on brother Dennis today. It could fall on brother Art tomorrow. It could follow Micah the next day. It could fall on sister Sheiley or sister Norma or any of you sisters. Uh a gift of prophecy is just that. It's a gift, right? &gt;&gt; It's a temporal gift that can be on a person one second, on somebody else the next. Uh it's just a gift and that's all it is. But a ministering prophet is a is a is a person that has the gift of prophecy but also uh I is a ministering gift of prophecy that puts them into place. Now that position uh uh negates uh a woman fulfilling a woman can be a prophetess or have a gift of prophecy but cannot be in a ministering office of prophecy. Amen. Amen. So the ministering gift of prophecy is is more or less my sub my subcategory of a word prophet. As we know, brother Brham talked about a word prophet. Uh brother Green brought out that that actual word many times that that phrase word prophet many times and brother Bram talked about being a word prophet. A word prophet to me is even someone that's separated even from that uh of ministering prophet or gift of prophecy. A word prophet is someone who is foretold in the scripture that that they are going to come and that they are going to have this gift in their lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in our Leodysian church age from the time that uh uh Isuza street the restoration of the gifts uh a lot of prophecy has happened a lot of people prophesying. you listen to brother Brandham's tapes and before uh people got to where they understood how to operate it which brother Brandham tried to do of course it still happened in the later years even when he would go out from the tabernacle to different places around the country you could still listen on tape and in the middle of brother Brandham's PREACHING THEY'LL STAND UP AND START prophesying &gt;&gt; and that's wrong we know that those gifts have to be in order and when a and when the man has the the the Holy Spirit is operating the gift of ministry at that time that that ministering gift has the priority. Amen. If anybody has a gift of tongues, if they have a gift of prophecy or something interpretation or something that has to wait, that has to be set aside while the Holy Spirit is operating in this capacity. Amen. Not in that capacity. But you can still hear people getting up and prophesying. Well, that's that's merely the gift of prophecy. Amen. It's just because a gift. Now uh that gift of prophecy would be on a ministering prophet as well and it would be on a word prophet as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But see in all of the prophecies and all the things you've heard, you may have been in services. I imagine most of us have probably been in services where you've heard a prophecy given where someone would stand up with a gift of prophecy and prophesy something. [snorts] Amen. And give a prophecy for them. But that gift can be on anybody at any time, man or woman. &gt;&gt; But a word prophet is a is a generational it is a it is a church agegiven man. &gt;&gt; Amen. That has that ministering gift of prophecy, but is a word prophet foretold in the scripture. Yes. There's thousands, tens of thousands, maybe min uh millions of prophecies that's gone out since Isuza Street that's been prophesied, BUT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE word prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only one. And there will only be one word prophet and his name is William Marian Brown. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was that word prophet FROM THE SCRIPTURE FORETOLD TO US BY THE scripture that he would come to this day and do what he did and we receive it and accept it as such. Now that word prophet brings into it brings into light all the things that that age needs those people need uh to get closer to God. uh in in the day of Jeremiah, which we're going to get which we're going to read here in just a minute, uh it was to try to bring the people together, try to get the people back to God, the the Israelites had gotten away from God. It got to where uh the things that they did that was actually God-given became a stink in God's nose because it became a formality to those people. Right. &gt;&gt; And Jeremiah was there known as the weeping prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh, and I imagine uh like brother Brandham said on tape, he said, "I go around the country and I preach as hard as I can preach. I give my time, I give my effort, I give my my energy, I give my prayer, I give everything to to trying to minister to help these people and to and to uh uh counsel them and talk to them." He said, "And every TIME I SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IT'S WORSE THAN IT WAS THE last time I was there." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And one time, Brother Brham was ready to quit." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "They don't listen to me. They don't want to hear me. Then I'll just stay at home." &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, that didn't last long because God told him better. Uh God showed him better. So, that didn't last very long. He wasn't off the field very long. God said, "You better get back to what I told you to do." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he did. Amen. He He did. He wasn't off the field very long. But you can see how someone like a Jeremiah could be a weeping prophet to give everything to to be vindicated by God. &gt;&gt; Yes. that God is using you. You are his mouthpiece. That God is using you and still to be ridiculed and put down and ignored and not paid attention to and just going on about the ungodly ways that they were doing. &gt;&gt; No wonder he was a weeping prophet. I would be too, &gt;&gt; right? You don't see any help. You don't see any encouragement. You don't see any uh advancement. You don't see anybody getting closer to God. in fact worse than getting a getting further away from God and becoming worse and and and everything that they do be getting more and more away from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like I said uh the other day uh brother said you you start missing church and you miss a service or two and pretty soon it's easier to miss the next and pretty soon it's easier to miss the next. Pretty soon it's easier to miss the next. Probably goes with streaming too maybe. I don't know how many people's watching now but it could be the same with streaming. You can be faithful to streaming and miss one and miss another and and then you think, well, I'll go back and watch it later. And then maybe you don't, maybe you do, maybe you don't, &gt;&gt; you know, and then it just get kind of loose and and then you you just that that that slide is like is like skiing. Uh once you get going down a hill, it's hard to stop. Your skis are waxed up and uh they're pointed forward. You're going to go down that hill and you just keep going and keep going and keep going before you know it, you're further away from God than you ever thought. You say, "Where? Where am I? How did I get here?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh it started with that one time. Yes. &gt;&gt; It started with that one day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Jeremiah became that weeping prophet because everything he said, everything he did, nothing mattered. Nobody cared. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jeremiah was a word prophet. Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a word prophet. Let's look and see what God said about Jeremiah. See what God told Jeremiah here. Amen. I want I'm going to read this. I got this quote I want to read, too. But [snorts] in Jeremiah chapter 1, so we can see the difference in a word prophet and someone with a prophetic gift or the the ministering prophet. Now, now, as I said, as you're going to Jeremiah 1, I put that subcategory in there because uh there there's a gift of prophecy, and that's that's just on its own. That's that's over here. Set aside 1 Corinthians 12. We go read it. We'll probably do it in the near future, but it's a gift of prophecy. That's that's in its little neat bubble. That's it. You know, again, like we said, that gift can fall on anybody, &gt;&gt; right? that fault that that gift of prophecy can come down. Now, you got to make sure though a prophecy is not just quoting scripture. &gt;&gt; A a a prophecy is not getting up and just shouting out, "God loves you." Well, the Bible tells us that. &gt;&gt; You don't get up and just say, "WELL, GOD'S COMING SOON." WELL, we all know that. The Bible says that. &gt;&gt; He's a good God. He We all know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can bring scripture. E even I' I've heard prophecy come or people pretend it to be prophecy. I don't consider it prophecy. Brother Brandham didn't either. If you go listen to the message, brother Brandham said that's not a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. A prophecy is something that foretells, which we'll read here in just a minute. But I've even heard people come and say, "Well, uh they had this experience and saw such and such." And and I've heard them say that. I sit there thinking, "What prophecy is there to that? We already know that." Amen. So if you come to prophesy on a prophecy, it's not a prophecy. The prophecy's already been brought forth. YOU CAN REITERATE that prophecy, but don't give it to me like you're prophesying it because I already know. It's already been prophesied. God already God already told through brother Brandham these things and we know. Amen. So to to prophesy what the word already tells us is not a prophecy, &gt;&gt; right? to prophesy what has already been prophesied that we know vindicated by a prophet by a word prophet we know is a prophet is not a prophecy &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you may reiterate that amen we know the country is going to be burnt border to border coast to coast we already know that &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; amen I don't need to you can reiterate I can retell you that you can tell that to one another that's fine but that doesn't make it prophecy because it's already been prophesied you see but that gift of prophecy now it's all setside side. It's It's a neat little thing. It's a gift. Can fall on anybody any time. Amen. Uh usually usually it tends to be Now, Brother Ram said it could fall on anybody at any time. Yes. And it can, but usually it tends to be a person that has that gift. Uh just like if someone has the gift of speaking in tongues or the gift of wisdom, uh the gift of knowledge, it it usually tends to be uh God's entrusted certain people with those gifts. Amen. Uh gift of prophecy the same way. But realistically speaking, it can fall on anybody at any time. Anybody here can fall on me, any of us to give a prophecy at any time for whatever reason it may be. And that's on its own. That's that gift of prophecy. But now the where I get the subcategory is is there is a difference between a ministering prophet and a word prophet. Amen. Now the word prophet is a ministering prophet. I hope this doesn't confuse you. Uh a a word prophet is a ministering prophet. He fulfills that that office of prophet in the script in what we just read Ephesians 4. That word prophet is a ministering prophet, but not every ministering prophet is a word prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; That does that make sense? &gt;&gt; I mean, every every tissue is tissue, but not every tissue is Kleenex. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every thumb is a finger, but not every finger is a thumb. Ev every ministering prophet is a ministering prophet, but not every ministering prophet is a word prophet. But every word prophet is a ministering prophet. Amen. Praise the Lord. I hope that makes sense. So, you see where I got my subcategory. I I don't separate them because they're they're basically in the same in the same category, but uh they are two different people. Amen. Two different offices, if you will. Praise the Lord. So, let's see what Jeremiah uh maybe we'll turn Jeremiah 1. Uh let's start with verse four. Jeremiah 1:4. Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before I even formed you in the belly. Now, who did it? Was it because of mom and daddy? No, it's cuz God did it. Remember what brother Ram told Brother Green? &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Brother Graham told Brother Green that he had uh Brother Green's mother and daddy come from these places and here and there and bring them together so that they would breed you. And he used the word breed like a cow &gt;&gt; or horse to breed you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God does. That's that's why I look at my family and of course my son and my daughter and and even grandchildren. Look, God does this for a a purpose. He brings them together for a reason. God sent me over 2,000 miles to come to to find her. And and again, one of these days, not during church, uh all the miracles that took place to bring me and her together, it was just a miracle. It's the easiest way to put it, but anyway, brought them together to bring them. SO WHEN SO WHEN GOD says before I before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee, that's God's doing. Amen. We're just playing the part to bring what his purpose is in this world, in our lives to pass. We're just we're just here to try to help be his instruments to bring that to pass. And obviously, of course, Jeremiah had instruments in his mother and daddy to come forth to bre Jeremiah to bring him forth before. BUT GOD SAID, "BEFORE I FORMED thee in the belly, I knew thee. and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is an ordination from God. That's God's doing. When God does that, just like God did uh with our current prophet, word prophet that we know of that uh that God sent to us, brother Brandham, we know in the same way and what God did in that circumstance, in that situation to bring us together. Now, Jeremiah, as we were saying, was that weeping prophet to bring these uh the bring the Israelites, bring them all back together, to try to organize them back to God, bring them back to puress and holiness and righteousness and the and and in the instruments that God gave them from the heart, from desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not formality, not because they had to or forced to, but because of desire. Because it was in their heart to do it. God wanted them all to come back to him. They had left from serving him and they wanted to bring back. Well, the word today was for the same purpose. It was to bring, of course, through the church ages, all the truths back up, bring them all back together. Bring a word to a people by a spirit that would bring us all together. Now, there wasn't to be a rapture then, but today there was a prophet to come to bring that word, to bring these people, us all together, TO BRING A rapture about. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; TO BRING ABOUT A BODY CHANGE. And each one is chosen for THAT PURPOSE. AS GOD chose Jeremiah and said, I [snorts] formed thee, I knew thee, I sanctified, ordained thee a prophet to the nations. He did the same thing for our prophet that WE KNOW FOR THAT PURPOSE. And now for our purpose today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God told him to lay up that food in the storehouse so that we'll be able to feast on that food anytime we want to. &gt;&gt; Amen. To partake of that food anytime that we want to because that food is life to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's lifegiving substance. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And God wants us to to to uh partake of that just as he did Jeremiah. See, now that's a word prophet. Amen. gift to prophecy or even a ministering gift is still ordained by God but it's a little again if I could say subcategory from that amen as this prophet or this ministering prophet is so we won't talk about today or uh next uh next time we won't talk about so much the gift of prophecy amen that can fall on anybody any time 1 Corinthians 12 but we'll talk about the the uh the the ministering prophet and word prophet. Amen. And and how those gifts mesh and come together. I got some scripture of course to read and make sure that we find that in the word of God. Now I want to go to this quote, read this to you before we move on. Amen. [clears throat] And greater than Solomon is here. Now make now maybe you can it makes a little more sense why in my opinion this is probably the most misunderstood gift of all of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it it really uh when people come in to try to be a word prophet. There was only one of those. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was brother Brandham. There's not going to be another word prophet. I know brother Brandham said I may be laying the platform and blah blah blah. He was always just being humble and contrite and trying to throw it off and not, you know, make him. But he knew &gt;&gt; and we knew. He was it. He was the man. It wasn't Jo. It wasn't to be Joseph. God bless his heart. It wasn't to be Joseph. Amen. I know he talked about his laying down his Bible, Joseph picking it up one day and all those things. Uh that to me, not to take anything away from Joseph, but to me that's just a man. I I had the same desire in my heart for my son. Let's just say that. I as a dad, I had I had the same desire in my heart for my son. I had that same desire in MY HEART FOR MY GRANDSON. To me, it was a it wasn't a prophecy. It was a dad's desire &gt;&gt; to see his son pick up the Bible and move on with it. He knew because of his he knew because of uh uh Billy Paul's marital situation that he wasn't going to be able to do it. So he was hoping his son Joseph would be able to do it. Amen. That doesn't make Jo now he said I believe Joseph was a prophet but in what way? Not a word prophet. He wasn't there to take his daddy's place. It was only to be one. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And his brother Brown and that's it. &gt;&gt; And there's nobody else to be it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not God. You don't baptize in his name. Amen. But the message that he brought was to bring a bride to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring to to bring a bride to the place of rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; And that's that was the job he did. And when that job was finished, God took him home. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the story. But we continue on. We continue to press this battle. We continue to feed off of this word. We continue to let that word minister to our hearts because of that word prophet. Anybody else come up and try to proclaim to be that they are taking brother Baron's place or they are a word prophet or something you know right away that that's wrong &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; because that he was there's only one to Leo to see it was him and that's it that's and there aren't going to be anymore because there's not any more ages &gt;&gt; this is going to be the end of it [snorts] now in greater than Solomon he said a prophet is a seer who sees the people's hearts and foretells the things that's coming to pass. Now you see why if you just get up and quote scripture or if you just get up and quote somebody or quote a prophecy that's already actually been prophesied. It might be foretelling a future event but it's already been prophesied like brother Brandham told us it would if I came up here today and I and I said that you know cars are going to be eggs well shaped like eggs. Well duh that's not a prophecy. Amen. When brother Brandham did it, it was a prophecy. &gt;&gt; To repeat that is just being repetitive. &gt;&gt; Amen. But a prophet is a seer who sees the people's hearts and foretells the things that's coming to pass. It's a future thing that a prophet can look ahead that God can show him ahead. Now whether it's a vision, whether it's in a dream or [clears throat] in whatever capacity God would show it to them in, that's usually typically the two, a vision or a dream to show them these things to actually see it. Now, God can actually give a prophecy just as an utterance to your heart like it would be um tongues uh or interpretation or something like you don't have to see it. Amen. It's an utterance that God would give you as a prophecy falls and says, "Thus sayeth the Lord, so and so is going to happen." Thus sayeth the Lord, so and so a person, this is going to be uh you or something. See, then that's a prophecy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you know, again, to get up and say God loves you or just quote scripture, that's not prophecy, right? &gt;&gt; If someone brings it as prophecy, uh uh they're wrong. Now, if someone comes and and brings prophecy of of a future thing or something that doesn't happen, Amen. then, Brother Bram said that person's influenced by the evil spirit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that person needs to come before the church to be prayed for to pray that devil off of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So people are out there following other prophets and trust me saints that uh from what I've heard I don't follow them. I don't know their names. I don't know anything about but from what I've heard there's thousands of them out there now. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They're on YouTube and on TV and on every place else. Again, I don't hear them. I don't know them. Uh I I used to get snippets once in a while from Sister Matise, but uh that ended. But uh I I never watched them. she'd send them and and I I've told her many times, I'm not interested. I this is a waste of my time. You know, I'm just not interested. &gt;&gt; And of course, &gt;&gt; I I don't know of one of them that was told that ever came to pass, right? &gt;&gt; Most of them had time frames on them and none of them I ever know come to pass. Those people and then they just keep prophesying stuff. You know, I mean, say if you throw spaghetti against the wall, something's eventually going to stick. You keep prophesying over and over stuff all left and right, eventually you're going to hit something &gt;&gt; and you come up and say, "Well, there's a famous woman that's going to die tomorrow." &gt;&gt; Well, that could be a that could be a hundred thousand different women famous women around the world. Uh, you know, you know, if you want to be a word prophet, tell me their name. &gt;&gt; Tell me what disease they have. Tell me where they live. Tell me their address. Amen. Like a word prophet does. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and then then we might have a discussion. Of course, then if it doesn't come to pass, but see, it's got to come to pass. Got to be a future event. Again, seeing the people's hearts foretell the things that's to come to pass. And now there's a gift of prophecy. Now, Brother Brandham's breaking the two apart. There's a gift of prophecy that's in the church with the local members. it falls upon any of them as we said they give a prophecy then it cannot be received but look now a gift of prophecy which we didn't get into just because we're not really talking the gift of prophecy but in this quote let's just read it then as a gift of prophecy then it cannot be received to the church until it's to be judged by two or three witnesses &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen two or three godly people holy ghost people, gifted people to to stand in judgment of that prophecy to believe whether it's of God or not. Amen. Uh back in the Old Testament, they had what they called the Gurman Thumbum, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. They would put that up. If the lights lit up, then you would know it's of God. If it didn't, then that person was a liar, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Well, we had the Holy Ghost today. The Holy Ghost is here working in his people. And if the Holy Ghost working in us looks at it and believes that to be of God and there's uh two or three witnesses, then then that uh that validates that prophecy, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Then what do you do? You wait for that prophecy to come to pass. You wait for it to happen. Maybe it could be something as simple as uh somebody stand up and say, you know, brother Dennis, don't don't go down river today because uh at Campbell, there's a truck going to come and hit you and kill you. You know, avoid that. Don't go that way. Go around Orange Grove and Sunrise or Skyline. Go a different way. Amen. That would be a prophecy to help, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if that's if that's of God, then you can see that that could be so. Amen. Maybe you read on the news later or hear that uh a truck hit a car at River and Campbell, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And killed somebody, but it wasn't brother DENNIS BECAUSE A PROPHECY CAME forth and said, "Don't you go that way." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that that would be a a f a thing of telling a future event. see something that could be judged by two or three people. He said now it had to be judged by two or three witnesses and then they have to put their seal on that to say that it is of God. Then they have to watch to see. Now remember, can I bring up this example? uh when when um Sister Shakaren was sick and dying and they were in a meeting in California and brother Brandham and and and Billy Paul and all these people stood up and prophesied. I forgot how many but it was it was a few people got up and prophesied sister thus SAYETH THE LORD THOU SHALT NOT DIE BUT THOU SHALT LIVE GOOD LONG healthy life and stuff like that two or three two or three I'm getting them now whether they were judged and found to be of God uh brother Ram doesn't say it's not on tape but we assume that in that situation that it was accepted and received of course it was something that Everybody wanted to hear, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to hear that she's not going to die. Everybody wants to hear that she's going to live. The family definitely wants to hear she's not going to die. &gt;&gt; And Billy Paul comes to him and Billy, of course, Brother Bram prophesied she's going to die. That her time's up. The Lord's going to take her. Of course, everybody hated brother Brown for that &gt;&gt; because he said she's going to And of course, everybody wanted to believe the other prophecies that said she was going to live. Billy Paul comes to his daddy. Says, "Daddy," says, "All these people out there's probably I I I can't help. All I can tell you is what God showed me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God told me she's going to die. &gt;&gt; God told me she's going to take her. And then when she died, you know who they blamed? Brother Brown. &gt;&gt; They blamed Brother Brandon because she died. He was the ONLY ONE IN CONTACT WITH GOD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THEY HATED HIM FOR IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; What does that sound like? Oh God. Amen. Because everybody wanted to live. Of course they wanted her to live. And people want to believe that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But it was her time to go and God was going to take her and that was it. When God showed Brother Brandham she was going to go, that was the end of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God told him that's the way it's going to be. Now whether there were people there to judge those prophecies, don't know. But in that day, people just stood up and prophesied left and right. And you don't know that there's ever judgment to it. But you find in the scripture what brother Brandham's talking about. It's to be judged by two or three witnesses. Then he says you have to watch to see if it happens. Make sure it is of God or not. Amen. [snorts] If Dennis decide if that prophecy comes out, let's just say two or three uh uh there's not very many two or three in here, but say say a couple of us believe that to be of God. That's that's the truth. And brother Dennis says, "Ah, nonsense. I'm just going to go down river anyway." And he goes down river and goes home, gets home safe. Everything's fine. Then what do you do? &gt;&gt; That prophecy was of the devil. It wasn't a prophecy line. It wasn't a prophecy. That was of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was something wrong. Anybody that judge that to be of God needs to be found at the altar, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Repenting, getting their lives right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now I know in the in the way that we live today that those gifts don't operate like the way they used to. Amen. And and and that's okay. They should. Amen. But as the spirit lives, you see because those gifts operate by the spirit. Now you you'll see it operating all over the place. But is it God? &gt;&gt; That's the question. See, it's got to be of God if it's not of God. And I have a confidence enough in this congregation knowing this place that if it that I if it happens it's of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you don't just see a a bunch of stuff going on because that's just just not But we we try to do what God tells and God owns and God leads us to do. We try to do that. And if God does that, then I I absolutely I'd be the first one as a pastor to say, "Absolutely. Let's have that. Do it." Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Prophecy, tongues, interpretation, whatever it might be, which a lot of times tongues interpreted is prophecy, but whatever it is. Amen. Uh the gifts of the spirit we want operating in in any capacity as God does. As the spirit lives, it won't happen as much. not not in godfilled churches because if the spirit's lifting now people don't have the spirit then they're not depending on the spirit to do it anyway &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; it's just them so the spirit can spirit can be completely gone not even just lifting but you can be in the middle of tribulation there's no spirit of God at all anywhere and they'll still be doing it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; because they they do it their dependence is not on the Holy Ghost their dependence is on self &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; amen now let's move on getting kind uh away from this now then they have to watch if it happens then it may never fall look now brother said it may never fall on that brother or sister again it may be or the next one that that gift of prophecy but a pro may be that gift of prophecy he said but a prophet P r o p e t is born a prophet &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen born a prophet always was ordained that before the world ever began. Now he's talking about word prophet too. But I believe that those gifts are operating. God ordained those as well. See now you take like Jesus Christ, king of prophets. He was from the garden of Eden, the seed of the woman, prophet, son of man is prophet. And Moses was born a proper child, a prophet. John the Baptist. Why? Uh uh John the Baptist. Why? Isaiah saw him several hundred uh 712 years before he was born. Isaiah prophesied about Jesus. The son is born. Amen. And and said he's the voice of one crying in the wilderness 712 years before he was born. Jeremiah, God said before he was even formed in his mother's womb that he would that he knew him and sanctified him and ordained him a prophet to the nation. See, prophets have the word of God and are born a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Born a prophet. And a word prophet is someone that's fortold that we know in the scripture that we can look and say people say where do you find William Brandham's name in the scripture. You can take them to Malachi 4. You can take them to Luke 17:30. You can take them to uh uh um um Matthew 17. Amen. There's several places in the scripture we know that that was foretold. Now, the name William Mary and Brown doesn't appear, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But mine doesn't either. Newton, George Newton Bennett the third doesn't appear in it either, but I find it all the time when I read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might not find your exact name in the Bible. Micah can because he is named after a character in the Bible, but you might not. Gabriel, too, but you might not find your actual name. Amen. But you can find your name everywhere in the scripture because God read it, wrote it for you, and you're in it. you're it's a part of your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we we we know that God has given that. Now he talks about a gift of prophecy is different. Now let's uh let's go over to first Corinthians for a moment. [clears throat] I won't hold you too much longer but we'll draw this comparison. First Corinthians 14 which is another you find uh mentioning of the gifts of the spirit that we're talking about which we believe prophecy is to to be one of those gifts. Amen. 1 Corinthians 14. I want to for a minute look at someone ordained of God. Someone for ordained of God. Um and and and someone with a gift, someone that has a gift of prophecy. Now, Brother Ram says it could fall on a person, they could prophesy, never prophesy again. &gt;&gt; It could fall on a person, it could fall on this person or that person. And uh maybe they do, maybe they don't. But generally generally that pro that that gift God gives to individuals. Not everybody has that gift. myself. I can't say that I've ever prophesied in my life. No. Maybe have said utterances that that actually happened. But to say I'm a prophet is or to have the gift of prophecy is a stretch. Uh maybe you have, maybe you haven't. Don't know. I don't know anybody in here that has claimed to have a gift of prophecy. But maybe God's used you in some way to speak that actually was something that was foretold and happened. You just didn't notice it or see it as being a a prophecy. So many times people are deceived by by perceptions. Perceptions are if it's a prophecy, someone's going to stand up in church and they're going to proclaim him, "Thus sayeth the Lord." That is only one avenue that God uses to bring prophecy. I mean you can read you can read even in the message and we know brother Brandham was a word prophet and yes he was in church and he said thus sayith the Lord many times but how many times did God give brother Brandham and flow through him a prophecy that was just in his living room or kitchen or a home or something &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; or just giving advice to or just counseling somebody talking to people that that that happened. It would actually was a prophetic utterance and probably not even notice it. Some of you probably may have experienced that. Don't know if you noticed that but could very well be. Amen. But generally it happens uh on on specific people that God said. But let's look what uh let's look at Paul for a minute. I'll look at two scriptural examples for each one. See in 1 Corinthians 14 uh verse um 36 let's look at this Paul says what came the word of God out of you out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are are the commandments of the Lord. Now that's a word prophet. When Paul when he comes forth and says let it be known if you think you are prophet spiritual let that person acknowledge that the things that I write unto you they are the commandments of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know now of course that we have them in our Bible as letters written that we have that we can read as commandments from the Lord. a word prophet. But if any any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. Now, let's go over to Galatians. Galatians chapter 1. [snorts] Galatians chapter 1. Uh we'll just start with the first verse here. [clears throat] Galatians 1. We read this uh last week in the apostilhip. But look here, remember what I remember uh when I mentioned about brother Brandham that brother Brandham was a word prophet, but God told him to do the work of an evangelist, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But yet he he in his life, he basically he he went around the country like an apostle or a missionary would. Amen. He preached in a lot of these auditoriums and things around the country like an evangelist. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Do the work of an evangelist." &gt;&gt; He said he wasn't made to be a pastor. But how many private interviews did brother Ramwood have with people when he pastored them? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, you see, my whole point is I I believe that word prophet as he was fulfilled all of those positions in some way, shape, or form. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, he couldn't stay as a pastor to be at home all the time, but he pastored people all the time. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; In that congregation, he still called him his congregation even. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But I believe he fulfilled those positions. Now, someone may be contrary to me on that. And that's fine because there's no there's nothing I can necessarily point you to that he said that would I'm just talk I I just say look at the man's life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Look at what he did. Look at who he was. Look at what he accomplished. &gt;&gt; Look at how God used him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what I can see, God used him in every single capacity &gt;&gt; in some way, shape, or form. But he was a prophet? &gt;&gt; Yes, he &gt;&gt; period. &gt;&gt; But look what Paul says now. Paul an apostle. Well, now wait. Is Paul an apostle or is he a prophet? He's called himself an apostle. Was he an apostle? Absolutely he was an apostle. You say, "But he he never went outside his little area there. He didn't go very far." That's not what an apostle is. Remember what we said last week? You don't have to fly 3,000 miles to be a missionary. &gt;&gt; You could be a missionary to your nextdoor neighbor, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Apostle, remember what was the definition? An apostle was someone who was sent. one who is sent good at starting things. So if God sends you to somebody, you just be you're just as much an apostle. You don't man minister behind a pullpit, but you do missionary work to your neighbor, to your friend, or to your coworker, something all the time. You do missionary work. You're one because you're one that sent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I'm an apostle." But he was also a prophet because you know what I as Paul being a word prophet like brother Brandham was personally believed he fulfilled each of those positions just like brother Brandham did in some capacity in some way. Paul was the same way. Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ which you said you can't be you can't be man called uh uh by Jesus Christ and God the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me unto the church of Galatia. Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God our Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. I marvel, look what Paul said now. I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another, in other words, it's not another gospel. It's just somebody's word, somebody's doctrine, somebody's teaching. It's not another. But there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But now look what he says. Paul says, "But though we or an angel from heaven," Remember, there's been angels kicked out of heaven, &gt;&gt; right? Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a word prophet. What he say? These are the commandments of the Lord. What we preach to you is what God said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're bringing to you is what God is commanding of us. What God is telling us, how God is leading us. This is what he's saying is what I'm bringing you is the word of God. [snorts] We know it now as the word of God. But those people sitting there didn't know that because it wasn't at that time. But he made sure and let them know this is the word of God. And if an angel comes from heaven and try to tell you anything else, let him be cursed. That's of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now [snorts] look at the difference. We got a prophet named Agabus. Now in Acts 11, we got a prophet named Agabus. And in Acts 11 27, it says, "And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch." Prophets plural. Amen. So these were men uh maybe women even because this is just a gift of prophecy that had that gift in their life that came came prophets unto Antioch. And there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dirt throughout all the world. What is that? That's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; this is going to happen. Agabus stood up and said there would be great dur throughout all the world. As the world as they knew it anyway. [snorts] Not the world as we know it, but as they knew it there. They didn't have the internet then. So they didn't have airplanes. So all they knew is their world was right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Now that's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; That's somebody getting up and having a foretelling of events that's going to take place of something that's going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One more because I'm going to close here just a minute. Uh Acts also in Acts 21 again. Agabus, a true prophet, &gt;&gt; not necessarily a ministering prophet because you never hear from him in a ministry context, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not a word prophet because he wasn't Paul. Paul was the word prophet. There's only one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That wasn't there. Peter wasn't that man. &gt;&gt; Uh, Agabus wasn't that man. Even though all these people had gifts of prophecy, there's only one. It was Paul, &gt;&gt; right? that that word pro as we call word prophet. Now agabus 21 uh acts 21 verse 10. And as we carried there many days there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus. And when he was come unto us he took Paul's girdle. And that girdle isn't like we know a girdle. It's just a sash something around the waist. Kind of like a scarf around the waist. Uh he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said, "Thus saith the Holy Ghost. So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that this owneth that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles." Now that's a warning that a that God is giving a prophecy that's giving that's a warning that's giving out. This is going to the man that this girl belongs to. This is going to happen to him. Amen. Now, the person he's talking about is Paul. Paul has the choice. Now, does he want to continue just to do what the Lord's told him to do, or is he going to do something else? Amen. And when we heard these things uh these things, verse 12, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. Now, the people are saying, "Oh, don't Paul, don't go to Jerusalem." Now, this prophecy, Amen. That could have been a warning like we said with with brother Dennis. Don't go. This is a warning. Don't go. &gt;&gt; Agabus is just saying this is going to happen as a prophecy. Paul could Paul could have done something else, gone a different way or done something. But if God's told you to do something, you do it anyway. You don't fear the enemy. You don't you don't fear the what the enemy could do to you. You just do what God says do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Paul and they were all scared and they tell Paul don't don't do it Paul. Then Paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for I am ready not to be bound only but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. So he went anyway and what and what happened? Exactly what Agabus said would happen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They took him and they bound him just like Agabus said would happen. that shows you a true prophet to bring that prophecy. And that prophecy happened. It came to pass. But it wasn't a ministering gift. It wasn't a word prophet gift. It was just a simple gift of prophecy to come out and said, "This is going to happen." And it happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did brother Ram say? Judged. And then see if it happens. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't say here if it was judged. We believe it must have been, but doesn't say here if it was. But it came to pass, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. The man whose girl that belonged to that actually happened. What do you see? What had to happen? Amen. And that's how it's supposed to operate. Amen. Now, now it it it could be something of fear. It could be a warning. It could be something that's just told as a prophecy. This is going to happen. Amen. And it happened. So many of these little things like this, even in Brother Brown's ministry, that happened that uh a lot of people don't understand. But it came to pass because it was a prophecy of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Why did Why did God send a bear and a lion to David? What was the point of David killing that lion and that bear? What was the point? Why Why would God even bother sending him? Because David needed to gain the confidence and the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. that when he's faced eye to eye with the enemy, he even grabbed the lion, I believe it was by the beard, it said, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He even grabbed him that he could look the enemy in his eye and stare and and stare him down face and defeat him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Same thing happens to us. Amen. To you to be able to stare down the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And to defeat him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember our five-fold ministry. prophet, missionary, apostle, teacher, evangelist, pastor. You bring them all together and you got a weapon to defeat the enemy. Yes. &gt;&gt; Beat the enemy with. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no other no other Bible that you could tell purpose for why David, why God sent that lion and that bear out there for David. only the fact THAT WHEN HE CAME FACE to face with that giant and he looked at Saul in the eye and he said is that that that uncircumcised Philistine is going to be just like that lion and that bear. God gave them into my hands. He'll give him into my hands. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He does the same thing for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we know God is with us. &gt;&gt; Paul went on up there and what happened? Yeah. He was bound. Absolutely. Th found thrown in prison. Beat thrown in prison. See, but God always has a way to show us he's with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To have faith, to increase our faith, to realize that we are not alone. We are not defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're his children. And God will God will fight for us. He always fights for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand if we could. God fights for his children as he does. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God is always there with us to keep us to help us to be able to overcome those things. Whatever it is of the world that Satan tries to send, just remember God any in the in the only way if you're a child of God, you're born again. And the angels of God are encamped around about you with flaming swords drawn to keep the enemy at bay. So if there's any enemy that gets in somehow, you have to know God allowed it for what re for for some reason. What reason? Lord, I don't know. Amen. That's for us in that in that moment to to pray about and to see Lord why, what, how you show me, you use me, you send me, you whatever God's purpose is. And it may be no other purpose but simply to help increase your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To help you come along, to help you grow in him. We're coming to a place now, especially saints, probably more now than ever, to where we're going to have faith for these bodies to change and to be translated and go in a rapture. Something that's only happened a few times in the whole history of humanity that we know by the scripture. It's going to happen to a whole group of people around the world. I want to be one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God gives us that faith. Amen. He shows us his way. He shows us his purpose. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's just sing this little chorus again. Amen. Before we dismiss today. For he is Lord. Amen. For he [music and singing] is Lord. Yes, He [singing and music] is Lord.

Praise the Lord. Let it be Lord Jesus to all of us today. Amen. He's our Lord and Savior. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Pray something was said to bless and stream from the Lord today. Amen. Remember now, um I I leave this afternoon. I'm going to Love, Texas for the week's work.

And and if people of the world and people of the country uh because it's Christmas want to bring out the name Jesus more often, I'm all in favor of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm all in favor of that. Praise the Lord. So God richly bless you today. Amen. Sister &gt;&gt; and happy birthday to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; I do appreciate that. That's the reason for the trip. Sonia's like, "We need to do something special for your 60th birthday." And I've had how many birthdays that I mean just like like everybody in here but Gabriel and Alice know when you get to a certain point is just another day really. It's just It's just, you know, but uh you you end up celebrating your children's birthday and then your grandchildren's birthday a lot more. It means a lot more. But thank you very much. Just appreciate that. I do appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Anyone else have anything before we go? &gt;&gt; Yes. May the Lord protect you and Sonia and have a great time. Your two Bibles are walking in that U cruise. Um, you heard the news about I never knew this. International waters teenagers can drink on the cruise. &gt;&gt; Oh, didn't know. &gt;&gt; One young man got drunk just a couple of weeks ago &gt;&gt; and killed the sister. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; On a cruise. &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard something about that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God protect you, &gt;&gt; you know, and you're there to enjoy yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And but there's going to be a lot of going on. &gt;&gt; Uh Micah is good at getting a ships there. He says there's different This is probably not for the video we said, but uh he has travel agency, so he set it up. He knows the cruise ships that are party ships and they're family ships and that are more adultoriented kind of ships, things like that. So yeah. So he made sure &gt;&gt; when I was even looking before he said, "Make sure you don't get on this one, this one, this one, this will be, you know, party on. This will be this." So he's the one that did it. So, &gt;&gt; but I think teenagers, according to my boss, according to my man, my team manager, they teenagers drink in Wisconsin anyways. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Well, that's good to know. When I get ready for a cruise with Leah, I want to talk to you about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. &gt;&gt; One that knows. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, God bless you all. Love you. Appreciate you. We'll be dismissed in a word of prayer to dismiss us. &gt;&gt; That's right. Gracious heavenly father God, we come to you Lord at the close of this service. Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; as always for being with us and speaking to us and being with us through our worship Lord Jesus. I know that we all felt your your presence Lord even before the song service God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Help us as we go our separate ways, Lord Jesus. We won't reconvene for a couple weeks, Father God, but we know that wherever we are, that we can take you with us if we choose to, Lord God, and may you help us that we can live a life that welcomes your presence every day. Yes, Lord, with us [snorts] the safe, those who have needs, Lord God, we lay them before you. We ask it everything in your name. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
