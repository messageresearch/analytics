[18:00] requests to mention today. Uh, brother
[18:04] Dennis uh had a fall down some of his
[18:07] stairs at home. Never been to his home.
[18:10] U
[18:12] dealing with knee problem and feet
[18:14] problem and uh I didn't
[18:19] how far he fell but some stairs. Uh they
[18:23] have a couple stairs go up at their
[18:26] house. uh he fell down the stairs and
[18:28] hurt his back. So, in addition to having
[18:31] the issues with his knee and uh his back
[18:35] uh his his feet now uh now he's hurt his
[18:39] back. He's wrenched it and um he's
[18:42] definitely is in pain and needs our
[18:44] prayer. He also asked us to continue to
[18:46] keep uh Leah in prayer, his wife. She is
[18:49] doing better and progressing day by day,
[18:51] but uh she does have some times of pain
[18:54] and depression. So, please remember her
[18:56] in prayer if you would. Also, I got a
[18:59] text from brother Danny. He said he was
[19:00] not able to sleep last night. Uh, so
[19:03] please remember him in prayer as well.
[19:06] Amen. Art got a text from Sharia. Art
[19:08] Shri aren't feeling good today. Art
[19:10] still dealing with his back problems and
[19:12] needs touch from the Lord. Shariah's
[19:14] having problems. She said her trigger
[19:16] finger. Then she said something about
[19:18] her middle finger. So, I'm not sure
[19:19] which finger it is, but she's having a
[19:21] hard time with that. and uh um um with
[19:26] her back. I believe it was her back as
[19:27] well. So, please remember them in prayer
[19:29] if you will. The Lord would just touch
[19:31] them and help them. I don't know what it
[19:33] is with the finger. She says she's just
[19:35] getting it. It's cramping or something
[19:36] and she's not able to bend it or
[19:38] something like that. So, uh please
[19:40] remember her in prayer if you would.
[19:42] Also, want to remember those who are
[19:45] here today. of course on and Steve and
[19:48] Pats and of course sister Karen in the
[19:50] mountains and sister Julie please
[19:53] remember them all in prayer as well.
[19:56] Please remember of course we know um the
[19:59] Via family sister Lydia passed away the
[20:01] other day. So please remember Ralph uh
[20:04] of course taking it very hard. Uh, I
[20:07] commend Brother Ralph when we were there
[20:08] and from what I've heard was very
[20:11] positive about Sister Lydia and told
[20:13] everybody he believed she was going to
[20:15] make it through. The Lord was going to
[20:16] touch her and she was going to live.
[20:17] Amen. I believe the Lord touched her,
[20:19] but it was her time to go. Amen. So, um,
[20:23] it just comes a time now where we let go
[20:26] and trust the Lord and know and believe
[20:28] that she is in the place that we're all
[20:31] striving to get to.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. As much as I love life and I enjoy
[20:35] my family and my life, uh, I'm living
[20:38] this life for him to get to him.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, that's that's what
[20:43] life is all about. And Sister Lydia's
[20:45] race has been run and it's over. So, uh,
[20:49] please remember the family in prayer and
[20:51] brother Ralph especially and Tim there
[20:54] at home, Jennifer and Nate. Please
[20:57] remember them all. And of course, their
[20:59] extended family. Sister Lydia, as we
[21:00] know, was very, very much a family
[21:03] person. Um, she always had prayer
[21:07] requests for her family, her extended
[21:09] family. Uh, so please remember them in
[21:12] prayer. They're going to miss Sister
[21:14] Lydia tremendously.
[21:16] Uh, of course I know. So, please
[21:18] remember them in prayer. I know uh that
[21:21] Sister Lydia was ready to go. She told
[21:23] me and Sonia when we were there uh that
[21:25] she was ready to go whenever the Lord
[21:27] decided to take her. So,
[21:30] So I know she was ready, but please
[21:32] remember them in prayer if you would. I
[21:34] had do not have any um
[21:38] announcement or arrangement she had. It
[21:39] was just a couple days ago. Uh sister,
[21:42] but Jennifer, sister Jennifer did tell
[21:44] me uh that her mother wanted me to
[21:46] officiate and she wanted to have it at
[21:48] the tabernac at Tucson Tabernacle. Uh I
[21:51] plan on trying to contact Brother Dan
[21:53] tomorrow, get a hold of him to make sure
[21:55] that that's a viable option. I'm sure it
[21:58] is. Uh I I can imagine that they would
[22:00] not want us to have it there. So uh
[22:03] please remember them uh that situation
[22:06] so that uh get all the arrangements
[22:08] together. As soon as anything is known,
[22:11] we'll make sure and let everybody else
[22:13] know uh so you can make your
[22:14] arrangements. She also uh informed me
[22:17] that they're going to cremate Sister
[22:18] Lydia. So, uh, as far as a memorial
[22:21] celebration service, uh, it's not
[22:25] necessarily as urgent that it be done
[22:27] quickly, uh, because of the cremation.
[22:31] So, uh, I'm not sure where it's going to
[22:33] be or when it's going to be. So, uh, but
[22:36] we will let you know as soon as we find
[22:37] out. Also got, uh, a bit of news when I
[22:40] was looking on Facebook, uh, yesterday.
[22:44] Um, I got a feed or something that I
[22:46] looked on and, uh, found out that a
[22:49] precious brother back in North Carolina
[22:51] passed away too. Uh I I think it was
[22:54] also the same day uh as sister Lydia,
[22:57] brother Mike orders. He was the long
[23:00] long long time song leader uh of brother
[23:05] uh Henry Green, Dan Daisley, and Joe
[23:08] Green. He went through three pastors at
[23:10] the same church being the song leader
[23:12] for that church for all those years. Uh
[23:16] it was either brother Joel Joe
[23:18] uh or brother null is brother null's was
[23:21] brother null and Shirley's song leader
[23:23] for a long time too as brother null and
[23:26] surely started going to church here at
[23:27] the Bible tabernacle he was their song
[23:29] leader uh he had some heart issues he
[23:32] had to retire uh and I I can't remember
[23:35] it's brother Joe brother null either one
[23:37] or maybe both told me that brother Mike
[23:39] was having some heart problems he had
[23:41] heart surgery and things like that a
[23:43] year or two ago uh but now the Lord has
[23:45] took him home so Uh he is one brother.
[23:49] He is one person uh that I absolutely
[23:53] know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[23:57] fulfilled the purpose that God put him
[23:59] on this planet for. He was a born song
[24:02] leader. I would I would so love to have
[24:08] the type of song leader that brother
[24:09] Mike orders was. Uh he he was a precious
[24:13] and and and and and beside that he was a
[24:15] tremendous precious brother. Uh he was a
[24:18] big fella. He was he was uh kind of
[24:21] tall. I don't know 6'3 4ish something
[24:23] like that. Big and kind of big in
[24:25] statue. Not fat really but just big uh
[24:28] big guy. Uh he was electrician. But
[24:31] please remember that family in prayer
[24:33] and the church Bible tabernacle. Joe
[24:35] Green pastor brother null goes there.
[24:37] They're going to miss brother Mike very
[24:39] very much. So, uh, he he was a a very
[24:43] precious brother and I just wanted to
[24:45] mention if you would please uphold him
[24:47] in prayer that family and church as
[24:49] well, I would appreciate it. So, Lord

[24:54] here. Anyone else have a a a prayer

[25:23] for. So he's brilliant. I have no

[25:29] doesn't quite know what to expect
[25:30] because those tests are copywritten. So

[27:26] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:30] Notice
[27:31] not the first time that Sister She said
[27:34] where Sister Lydia used to sit. Amen.
[27:37] That kind of was special for me when I
[27:38] saw you go and sat there.
[27:41] Nobody's hardly really ever sat there
[27:43] since she uh since she did. That was her
[27:46] spot. So, amen. Praise the Lord. Mike
[27:48] has got us on. He wants to sing for us
[27:50] today. So, amen. Praise the Lord. Be
[27:52] with him.
[28:00] God bless you. Uh, this song was
[28:01] actually daddy had it on his list last
[28:03] week that didn't get around to it, but
[28:05] it's one of my favorites to sing. Um,
[28:07] and then me too, you just sing it. Uh, I
[28:11] guess it's kind of um dedicated to
[28:14] Sister Lady, but it's more of our
[28:17] mindset. Um, feel free to sing along at
[28:20] on
[28:24] Open.
[28:27] [Music]
[28:37] My heart can see
[28:42] when I pause to remember.
[28:46] [Music]
[28:48] A heartache here
[28:51] is a standing song.
[28:57] Oh, along goes trail.
[29:01] Let's find it all upward.
[29:07] This troubled world
[29:10] is not my final home.
[29:16] Not until then
[29:19] my heart will go on singing
[29:23] [Music]
[29:25] until then
[29:28] with joy I'll carry on
[29:33] until the day
[29:36] my eyes behold that city
[29:42] until the
[29:45] Your call
[29:47] me
[29:50] the things.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Will they lose their value?
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] &gt;&gt; They're just sorrow for a while.
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] They cause
[30:15] to tremble
[30:19] there
[30:21] will only be a smile
[30:26] but
[30:30] my heart will know I see
[30:35] but
[30:38] with joy I'll carry Behold
[30:44] until the day
[30:47] my eyes behold that see
[30:52] until the day.
[30:55] God knows
[30:57] me.
[31:00] Now this we world
[31:04] with all its flaws and struggle
[31:10] may take its full
[31:13] of misery.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:18] The soul of man
[31:22] is the way
[31:27] we release
[31:32] for the sky.
[31:36] Until then
[31:39] my heart will go see
[31:43] [Music]
[31:48] I
[31:52] until the day
[31:55] my eyes behold that city
[32:01] unto the
[32:04] God holds
[32:06] me until
[32:09] this weary world
[32:13] with all its trily.
[32:22] [Music]
[32:26] The soul of man
[32:30] is like a rain
[32:37] [Music]
[32:40] for the sky
[32:44] to
[32:47] my heart
[32:50] [Music]
[32:53] to
[32:55] joy. Oh, I'll carry on
[33:00] until the day
[33:03] my eyes behold that city
[33:08] until the day.
[33:11] God
[33:14] [Music]
[33:22] see
[33:23] [Music]
[33:25] until
[33:29] I
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] be all that
[33:40] [Music]
[33:41] until the king.
[33:52] [Music]
[33:58] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[34:02] Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[34:06] Hallelujah. What a wonderful song. I did
[34:09] have it last week. It's got I'm kind of
[34:13] late with the time, so I left it off,
[34:14] but I'm glad Micah sang it today. And I
[34:17] thought about leaving off this other
[34:18] song I had on here for today. But after
[34:21] he sang that, we're going to sing this
[34:23] one anyway. Amen. Not in a hurry today.
[34:27] Praise the Lord. Don't like to keep too
[34:31] long, but number 604.
[34:34] Psalm number 604.
[34:37] and we'll try to sing this and we'll
[34:40] dedicate this to sister.
[34:43] Amen.
[34:46] I'll see you in the rapture.
[34:49] Help me sing it. I probably need some
[34:52] help.
[34:53] [Music]
[34:56] If we never
[34:58] [Music]
[35:03] praise the Lord. If we never meet again
[35:09] on this earth, my precious friend
[35:14] and to God you have been true
[35:18] and we lift above all sin. Then for us
[35:24] there'll be a meeting.
[35:27] There's going to be a greeting.
[35:32] I'll see you in the rapture some sweet
[35:37] day.
[35:39] Oh yes, I'll see you in the rapture.
[35:45] See you in the rapture.
[35:49] I'll see you at the meeting in the air.
[35:58] There with our blessed Savior will live
[36:04] and reign forever.
[36:07] I'll see you in the rapture some sweet
[36:13] day.
[36:14] [Music]
[36:16] To my loved ones, let me say
[36:20] that there's sure to come a day
[36:25] when the Lord will come again.
[36:29] And his waiting bride away.
[36:34] So get ready now to meet him when
[36:40] go and greet him.

[36:48] sweet day.
[36:51] Oh yes. I'll see you in the rapture.
[36:56] I'll see you in the rapture.
[37:00] I'll see you at the meeting in the air.
[37:07] [Music]
[37:09] There is our blessed Savior will live
[37:15] and reign forever.
[37:18] I'll see you in the rapture. Some sweet
[37:23] days at last verse again.
[37:26] To my loved ones, let me say that there
[37:31] is surely come a day
[37:35] when the Lord will come again
[37:39] and catch us waiting right away.
[37:44] So get ready now to meet him with this
[37:49] message. Go and read him. I'll see you
[37:54] in the rapture some sweet day.
[38:00] Oh yes. I'll see you in the rapture.
[38:06] See you in the rapture.
[38:10] I'll see you at the meeting in the air.

[38:33] name. One more time. Oh yes. I'll see
[38:37] you in the rapture.
[38:41] See you in the rapture.
[38:45] I'll see you at that meeting in the air.
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] There with our blessed Savior will live
[38:59] and reign forever.
[39:02] I'll see you at the rapture.
[39:06] touch.
[39:11] Amen.
[39:13] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[39:17] Jesus. Amen. What another promise we
[39:20] have, saints. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:24] What another promise we'll have. Our
[39:26] loved one has gone on. It's just for a
[39:28] short time. Praise the Lord. Just for a
[39:31] short period. Amen. We'll reunite with
[39:34] them again very soon.
[39:36] Hallelujah. And I believe that time is
[39:38] very, very soon. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[39:42] We'll meet our precious loved ones in
[39:45] the air with our Lord and Savior Jesus
[39:47] Christ. Hallelujah.
[39:51] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. God bless
[39:54] you. Let's all if we could now
[39:57] and we'll just turn the scripture here
[40:00] now. Amen. Like to thank everyone for
[40:03] your prayers. Amen.
[40:06] Thankful to be able to have made it
[40:08] through this past week. It was a pretty
[40:11] tough one. I'll admit um it was quite
[40:15] hot. It was 100 degrees two different
[40:18] days
[40:20] in the mid to upper every day but Friday
[40:23] and the humidity was was pretty tough.
[40:26] So, um every one of us had a hard time
[40:30] with it. So, I know that u uh I I know
[40:36] that in my heart I'm looking back and I
[40:38] know there's a group of people praying
[40:40] for me. I don't know how these other
[40:42] guys hang on. Um I I probably drunk an
[40:47] elephant's weight of fluids this week uh
[40:51] just to try and stay hydrated best I
[40:53] could. I think I did pretty good because
[40:56] I didn't cramp too bad. So, but I know I
[40:59] know I know I have a group of people
[41:01] back praying for me and holding me up
[41:03] and that means so much to me. Amen. To
[41:06] continue to keep pressing
[41:09] there were times it got uh quite
[41:12] difficult. So um so I do appreciate your
[41:16] prayers
[41:18] and your prayers for the whole team not
[41:20] just me but uh I appreciate it very
[41:23] much. So thank you thank the Lord to be
[41:26] here today. Amen.
[41:28] Turn our Bibles now to Romans chapter 8.
[41:32] Amen. We're going to start adoption part
[41:34] 22, position in Christ, part six. Amen.
[41:38] We're almost done with this section
[41:39] here. Amen. We're pretty close really, I
[41:42] think, to being done. But, uh, adoption
[41:45] 22, position in Christ, part six. But as
[41:48] we do, we'll start in Romans chapter 8,
[41:51] where we start. Amen. And we'll probably
[41:54] start the every other portion of this.
[41:57] Amen. So before we read the word, we
[42:00] just bow our heads for another word of
[42:01] prayer. Lord Jesus,
[42:04] Father, what it is in our hearts, God,
[42:07] when we sing songs like that. Amen. The
[42:10] one that Mike sang and all the songs of
[42:12] Zion that we sing, Lord, but these
[42:13] precious songs and Lord, when we know
[42:16] there's things, Lord, that we've loved
[42:20] and have meant so much to us, God, that
[42:22] we see go on to their reward. how much
[42:24] it means to us in our hearts, Lord, to
[42:27] realize these promises that we have,
[42:29] God, that it's just a short pass. It's
[42:32] just a short time, Lord, that we'll all
[42:35] be together again, Lord. Father, I I
[42:38] know this song is probably uh maybe a
[42:41] little sensationalized with seeing each
[42:43] other in the rapture. Lord, it is the
[42:45] epitome of that song that we will be
[42:48] together again one day. That means the
[42:51] most to me, Lord. God, that we will be
[42:53] together. We will be with our loved
[42:55] ones. We will see our loved ones again,
[42:57] Lord. And we'll be in that perfect,
[42:59] beautiful place of rest and peace that
[43:02] you've prepared for us that you promise
[43:04] to go and prepare for us, Lord. And God,
[43:07] how we look forward to that time. But
[43:10] Lord, again, while we're here on this
[43:11] earth, may we continue to be about our
[43:14] father's business. continue to press
[43:17] this battle, continue to preach this
[43:19] word, continue to come to church and get
[43:22] and put our shoulders to the wheel,
[43:24] Lord, and just continue to press this
[43:26] battle, Father. For God, we know that
[43:29] even if we don't have that much longer,
[43:31] and I don't believe we do, Father, we
[43:33] want to give every moment that we have,
[43:35] God, to you, Lord, in all that we can,
[43:37] Father, for your glory and honor. May
[43:40] you bless this service today, God. Bless
[43:42] these that have come, Lord, those may be
[43:44] watching. Lord, just bless. May your
[43:47] Holy Spirit move in this place in a
[43:50] special, supernatural, powerful way,
[43:52] God, to sweep through here and bring all
[43:55] the great blessings to us, God, that we
[43:57] enjoy, Father, from your Holy Spirit.
[44:00] Lord, may we believe, Lord, know that
[44:03] this world will not return void.
[44:05] Accomplish it in us today, God, that you
[44:07] sent it for, God. We thank you for all
[44:10] that you do for us, God. And give you
[44:12] thank, praise, honor, and glory, Lord.
[44:15] Bless the remaining part of this
[44:16] service. Anoint our lips, Lord, to speak
[44:19] this word, all of our ears to hear, to
[44:21] receive that that you'd have for us. We
[44:24] commit it to you in the name of the Lord
[44:25] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[44:29] Amen. Romans 8, chapter chapter 8, verse
[44:33] 14. For as many as are led by the spirit
[44:36] of God, they are the sons of God. For we
[44:38] have not received the spirit of bondage
[44:40] again to fear, but we have received the
[44:42] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba,
[44:45] father. The spirit itself beareth
[44:47] witness with spirit that we are the
[44:49] children of God. And if children, then
[44:51] hes of God and joint hes with Christ, if
[44:55] so be that we suffer with him, that we
[44:57] may be also glorified together. You can
[45:00] be seated if you'd like.
[45:03] Amen. last I believe last uh last week
[45:07] we left with with Revelations chapter
[45:09] 10. I believe that's where we left off
[45:14] going through Revelation chapter 5
[45:16] realizing Jesus the only one who was
[45:20] able to prevail to take a book out of
[45:22] the right hand of him who God sitting on
[45:24] the throne had that book in his hand.
[45:27] John weeping because the the book was
[45:30] closed and the book was closed and there
[45:32] was nobody he looked around that was
[45:34] found worthy to touch the book to open
[45:38] the seals or even look on the book.
[45:42] From the midst of the four 24 elders, a
[45:44] voice came forth and said, "Weep not,
[45:46] John, for the lion of the tribe of
[45:48] Judah, Jesus Christ, had prevailed to
[45:51] take the book and to loose the seals
[45:53] thereof." And there brought forth the
[45:56] book of redemption. There brought forth
[45:59] revelation, the shining forth, the
[46:00] opening of that book of redemption to
[46:03] reveal in that book every name and the
[46:06] redemptive plan of God to that was to be
[46:09] brought forth in his decreed season and
[46:12] time that God would would uh uh take
[46:15] under his wing and to brood and to bring
[46:18] us forth so that we one day will go
[46:20] beyond this mortal reach. Amen. Make
[46:23] heaven our earthly our our heavenly
[46:25] home. Amen. And we went over to
[46:27] Revelation 10 because in Revelation 5,
[46:30] we saw the book him that took the book.
[46:32] Now we see the one that took the book in
[46:34] Revelation 10. And he has the book in
[46:37] his hand and he has the book that's
[46:39] open. Amen. Now, uh, a lot of people uh
[46:43] have semantics about seals uh of of the
[46:48] seven seals. And I've had a lot of
[46:51] people ask me how you feel about the
[46:53] seals and do you feel the seals are
[46:55] open? And uh to me I I have I always ask
[46:59] if someone brings that uh question to me
[47:02] I said well are you asking me are they
[47:04] revealed? Are you asking me are they
[47:06] broken? Are you asking me are they open?
[47:09] Are you asking me how they've been
[47:10] preached? Because to me each one of
[47:13] those points has a different time. Amen.
[47:17] Uh I do believe that the that that the
[47:20] seals were open because the Bible says
[47:23] that they are. Amen. The lamb prevailed
[47:26] and come forth to l loose the seals and
[47:29] to open the seals thereof. Amen. Uh at
[47:32] those seals revealed. Well, that's an
[47:35] individual thing. Uh, I believe that
[47:38] each seal, as we said last week, came
[47:41] down by an angel to the prophet to give
[47:44] him that seal for that night to preach
[47:47] the revelation of that seal. Does
[47:49] brother did brother Brandham, I believe,
[47:51] have a revelation of that seal?
[47:53] Absolutely. I believe he does. He did.
[47:56] But he did not no more know the second
[47:58] seal on the first seal night than he did
[48:01] anything else. Amen. It was the next day
[48:04] that the next seal came and was revealed
[48:07] to him and was shown to him and he went
[48:10] out into the public and preached it.
[48:12] Now, do you ask me, has the seals been
[48:14] preached? Yes, they have. Has the
[48:16] revelation of the seals been preached?
[48:18] Yes, I believe they have. But a
[48:21] revelation is an individual thing to
[48:24] everybody. Has that seal have those
[48:26] seals been revealed to you? Amen.
[48:29] There's a lot of people in the world
[48:31] whom those seals have not been revealed
[48:33] to. There's probably people in this
[48:35] world who have read the preaching and
[48:38] the revelation of the seals and don't
[48:40] still yet have a revelation of the
[48:42] seals. Amen. Because you can read I mean
[48:46] how many people have read the Bible? How
[48:48] many people through history how many
[48:50] people in the world today have read this
[48:52] Bible cover to cover and still don't
[48:54] have a revelation of it? Millions.
[48:58] billions. I don't know that but still
[49:01] don't have a revelation of it. There's a
[49:03] lot of people's read. So to me, now the
[49:06] other thing is have the seals broke?
[49:09] Well, it depends on the which seal
[49:11] you're talking about. Amen. Because to
[49:15] me, when a seal breaks forth, it means
[49:18] that that seal is actually manifesting
[49:20] itself on the earth at that time. And if
[49:23] you ask me if the six seal is broke, I
[49:26] believe it's been opened. I believe it's
[49:28] been preached. We know it's the
[49:30] tribulation. But has it broke forth on
[49:33] the on the earth? No. The six still
[49:36] hasn't. H is it starting to creep in?
[49:39] Yeah, I I would say it is because I
[49:42] believe that we're in a a
[49:45] pre-tribulation, if you will, period of
[49:47] this world just uh losing itself and
[49:51] coming to the place of of Armageddon. Uh
[49:54] I do believe it's got to that place. But
[49:56] has the but has it been broke or
[49:58] unleashed? No.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Because the bride's still here.
[50:02] Tribulation won't completely unfold,
[50:04] break forth on this planet until the
[50:07] bride is gone. Then the tribulation sets
[50:10] in. That's the sixth seal. Amen. So I it
[50:15] it just comes to a place of people get
[50:17] things all scrupled up to me to uh uh to
[50:21] bring something in them. When you start
[50:23] putting stuff out of misplace, I
[50:25] remember brother Green uh he took
[50:29] several several services because it was
[50:31] so much confusion that people had about
[50:33] the first coming, the second coming, the
[50:35] third coming. and brother Brandon uh
[50:37] brother Green spent uh a great deal of
[50:40] time and several services and many
[50:42] quotes and stuff uh showing to the to
[50:47] the tabernacle at the time uh the things
[50:49] that unfolding of of of these comingings
[50:53] and and when they were to be and how
[50:55] they were to fall in line and uh and uh
[50:58] I got I got a lot of appreciation with
[51:01] brother Green over that and and uh
[51:04] agreed with him in it. A lot of people
[51:07] don't uh but a lot of people like to go
[51:09] over into the intellectual side of it to
[51:12] try to bring something that maybe isn't
[51:15] quite here yet. And then because you got
[51:19] if you put stuff out of place like that,
[51:21] then you got certain people and I know
[51:24] certain people that believe the rapture
[51:26] has already taken place and that we're
[51:29] here and that this is this is what's
[51:32] going on. Amen. You have people say,
[51:35] "Well, it's going to be uh it's going to
[51:37] be on a certain day at a certain time in
[51:39] a certain place." And of course, that
[51:41] prediction goes by. And then they
[51:43] predict another day, and then they
[51:45] predict another day, and they prophesy
[51:47] another day, and they prophesy another
[51:48] day, and as these days continue to roll
[51:51] on, they're found to be false prophets
[51:53] all along the line. So, where does it
[51:56] get you? Just take it as it is brought.
[51:59] Amen. We don't try to make anything out
[52:01] of it that that it isn't. Amen. And and
[52:04] it's e it's probably easy to do if you
[52:07] let the devil take you off on that
[52:09] tangent. But to me, it's so easy just to
[52:12] stay grounded, just to say just stay
[52:15] just to stay solidified in what brother
[52:17] Brandon brought us. Amen. And what God
[52:21] has got for us here now. Amen. And
[52:24] that's what I want to get to because we
[52:26] talked about cuz I want to go back over
[52:27] to Revelation 10. And we talked about so
[52:31] much about brother Brandham and and what
[52:34] he went through and of course the sword
[52:36] coming in his hand and takes a strong
[52:38] hand of faith to take the sword to the
[52:40] enemy and uh I I personally believe that
[52:43] was brother Brandham's adoption time in
[52:46] there when the seals come forth and the
[52:48] sword hit his head and all those things
[52:49] that was happening. That that was that
[52:51] that's my opinion. I could be completely
[52:53] wrong on that and it doesn't mean
[52:55] anything, but that's just my opinion.
[52:59] But now
[53:00] a and Jesus being adopted and the names
[53:04] coming forth, but there's there's
[53:05] there's that place again that that I
[53:08] want to place us at like before. Um
[53:14] it it needs to do us as much good as as
[53:18] to us as as it is when we read about
[53:21] brother Jesus or or the things we go
[53:24] through and bring. But see, all those
[53:26] things are brought along so that it
[53:28] helps us understand where our position
[53:31] is and where we're at and what's going
[53:34] on now and what our part is that we are
[53:36] to play in that position. But so let's
[53:39] go back and read Revelation 10 again.
[53:45] I want to start with the first verse.
[53:46] Revelation 10. And start with the first
[53:48] verse. We didn't read all the way
[53:51] through to what I want to read today and
[53:54] that was on purpose because I wanted to
[53:56] save that for today. I did not want to
[53:58] get into that part last week. I wish
[54:00] everybody was here last week was here
[54:01] this week. But anyway, it's like I said,
[54:04] when you you have a series like this,
[54:06] you have some multiple parts and uh I I
[54:09] try to make each message self-contained.
[54:13] So, if a person just hears that one
[54:15] message, uh it's a it's a message within
[54:18] itself. Uh but it's kind of hard when
[54:21] you're trying to tie everything
[54:23] together. Uh sometimes part 22 all the
[54:27] way back to part three or something. It
[54:29] it's kind of difficult to do that. So um
[54:32] I I I hope it I I hope it is received
[54:36] and and comes across to people like
[54:39] that. But anyway, so I want to go back
[54:41] to chapter 10 verse one.
[54:44] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[54:47] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[54:50] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[54:52] as it were the sun and his feet as
[54:54] pillars of fire. We established
[54:56] understand that's Jesus. Amen. He had in
[55:00] his right in his hand not his right hand
[55:02] but he had in his hand a little book
[55:04] open. Now that book the book of life the
[55:07] lamb's book of life open in his hand. It
[55:11] was closed in Revelation 5. Here it's
[55:13] open.
[55:15] Um the little book was open. He set his
[55:18] right foot upon the sea and his left
[55:21] foot upon the earth. Remember uh I heard
[55:24] a lot of revelations if you will, a lot
[55:28] of ministering uh over that. A lot of
[55:31] which I have to be completely honest I
[55:35] don't agree with uh a lot of it because
[55:39] I because I have found that people have
[55:42] taken this out of context and then it
[55:46] throws to me everything else uh beyond
[55:50] even now and beyond out of out of cater
[55:54] the scripture and brother Adam's quote
[55:58] uh I've had people try to bring this to
[56:00] me. I'm like, "Well, brother, what do
[56:02] you do with this quote? And what do you
[56:04] do with this?" And see, cuz it's like we
[56:06] talked about last week with Matthew 28
[56:08] and and Acts 3 uh and baptism. How do
[56:12] you reconcile the two? You know, if you
[56:15] go off on a tangent and you and you just
[56:18] completely fall in the line of baptism
[56:21] and follow, son, the Holy Ghost, then
[56:22] what does that where does that leave
[56:24] Peter? Where does that leave all the
[56:27] people that were there that were
[56:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ?
[56:32] Were they wrong?
[56:34] There's got to be a reconciling of those
[56:36] things. You You can't have one out here
[56:39] and change it and just say, "Well, you
[56:41] know, I I'm just going to take what
[56:42] Jesus said. Uh and forget about what
[56:45] Peter said. I just take what Jesus
[56:47] said." But Peter said what Jesus said.
[56:50] He just spoke it in revelation that the
[56:52] name of the father, son, holy ghost is
[56:54] the lord Jesus Christ. He just spoke it
[56:56] that way. See, so he just brought the
[56:59] revelations. So you got to do the same
[57:00] thing as people come and try to minister
[57:03] uh what I would consider I I say this
[57:07] very humbly but what I would consider
[57:09] tangents because you if you take this
[57:13] along those lines you can't reconcile so
[57:16] many other scriptures even and quotes
[57:20] they just don't dovetail. But if you
[57:22] bring it back into the context and
[57:25] realize if you place it uh if you place
[57:28] that puzzle piece at the base of the
[57:30] tree instead of the top of the tree, the
[57:33] picture looks clearer. It makes more
[57:36] sense because it looks like a clear
[57:39] picture. Amen. And that's the only way I
[57:42] can do it. I'm just I'm just dumb enough
[57:44] that I I don't have the intellect to
[57:48] follow the intellectual thought that a
[57:50] lot of people have on these things
[57:52] because it just doesn't make sense. It
[57:54] doesn't work. If I look at it, it's got
[57:57] that quote has got to dovetail with that
[57:59] quote. It's got to do dubtail with that
[58:01] quote. It's got to dubtail with that
[58:02] quote.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; It has to.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. This scripture's got to do with
[58:08] this scripture. It's got to dubtail. It
[58:10] has to.
[58:12] If there's anything wrong, if it the
[58:14] picture doesn't look right, you've got
[58:16] to go just take your puzzle and just
[58:18] tear it all apart and start all over
[58:19] again. Just put your bottom left corner
[58:23] and then start and do your just start
[58:26] over cuz you got all somewhere because
[58:28] there's nothing wrong with the message.
[58:30] There's nothing wrong with this Bible.
[58:32] Nothing. So if it's not fitting
[58:34] somewhere, the problem is with you, with
[58:36] me. See, it's got to fit. But I got
[58:40] scripture. See, from what I said, what I
[58:43] talked about, the complete conquering,
[58:45] he's got the book in his hand, the book
[58:47] is open, and he puts one foot on land
[58:50] and one foot on sea to me is a complete
[58:53] conquering of the enemy.
[58:55] Amen. That that's when Yes. Calvary
[58:59] finished the work, but the completeness
[59:02] of that work is continuing to unfold.
[59:04] You know that as well as I do. Because
[59:06] you battle the same Satan today as I
[59:09] battle. You say, "Why do you battle
[59:11] Satan when Jesus said it is finished at
[59:14] the cross?"
[59:16] Because we live in victory. We live in
[59:19] the promised land like they did in
[59:20] Joshua. When Joshua divided out the
[59:24] land, they lived in their position. They
[59:26] lived in their place. But they still had
[59:29] battles. They still fought. They still
[59:32] had to live their lives. All of that was
[59:35] a part of their life. And our victory,
[59:37] our Canaan land is the Holy Ghost. And
[59:41] Jesus said, "It is finished." But we
[59:43] still had to be born again.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; And even after we were born again, we
[59:48] still take out that sword and we fight
[59:50] every single step that we take, do we
[59:53] not?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; We fight the devil every step of the
[59:56] way.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's that that that's a part of the
[1:00:00] life that we live. We still have to
[1:00:02] fight that battle.
[1:00:04] Jesus said, "It is finished." But here
[1:00:06] he comes down with the book open and
[1:00:08] he's conquering every bit of the enemy
[1:00:12] by putting one foot on land and one foot
[1:00:14] on sea. Every bit of it. It's claiming
[1:00:16] it's his. Praise the Lord. We're still
[1:00:19] living in Satan's Eden, but it doesn't
[1:00:21] belong to him anymore.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Belongs to Christ. It
[1:00:25] belongs to us. I have scripture
[1:00:30] to try to back that up. Look at this. I
[1:00:33] I don't just arbitrarily try to make
[1:00:35] stuff up. I try to make sure that when I
[1:00:38] feel like the Lord's given me something
[1:00:40] that there's scripture to go with it.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; There's scripture to back that up. Now
[1:00:45] look at this. Revelation 13.
[1:00:49] He puts one foot on land, one foot on
[1:00:52] sea.
[1:00:54] Correct? with the book open in his hand.
[1:00:56] One foot on land, one foot on sea. He's
[1:00:58] got all the names. He's got all the
[1:01:00] redemption in his hand. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:03] Aren't you glad you're in his hands?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. In his hand, he puts one
[1:01:08] foot on land, one foot on sea. Complete
[1:01:10] conquering. So, what does that put you
[1:01:13] in his hand? Conquering over every bit
[1:01:16] of the enemy. Look, Revelation 13. And I
[1:01:19] saw upon the sand of the sea, the sand
[1:01:22] of the sea.
[1:01:25] I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I
[1:01:28] saw a beast rise up from where? Out of
[1:01:33] the sea.
[1:01:35] Praise the Lord. Where was one foot
[1:01:37] Jesus put?
[1:01:39] On the sea.
[1:01:41] In Revelation 13, a beast comes out of
[1:01:44] the sea.
[1:01:46] Praise the Lord. having seven has 10
[1:01:48] horns upon his heads uh his horns 10
[1:01:51] crowns upon his head the name of
[1:01:52] blasphemy. Now let's go over to verse 11
[1:01:55] chapter 13 11
[1:01:59] and I beheld another beast. Amen. Which
[1:02:02] we know is the image to the beast in
[1:02:04] this is United States. Amen. Coming
[1:02:06] forth and saw another beast coming out
[1:02:10] of the earth.
[1:02:13] What did he put feet on? He put one foot
[1:02:15] on land, earth and one foot on the sea.
[1:02:20] Where did the two beast the beast of the
[1:02:23] beast come from? Come out of sea and
[1:02:27] land. Complete conquering. Jesus
[1:02:30] completely conquered
[1:02:33] every enemy.
[1:02:36] Every bit of defeat,
[1:02:38] every bit of of Satan's WS, his minions,
[1:02:43] his demons, every of it has been
[1:02:46] defeated.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; he put one foot on land and one foot on
[1:02:50] sea. Praise the Lord. Satan trying to
[1:02:54] conquer. Jesus conquered every bit of
[1:02:58] what Satan did. One foot on land, one
[1:03:01] foot on sea.
[1:03:04] The scripture doesn't lie.
[1:03:07] Now, let's continue because we're going
[1:03:09] to find that spot for us.
[1:03:13] One foot on he said one it said his
[1:03:17] right foot upon the sea, his left foot
[1:03:20] upon the earth
[1:03:22] and cried with a loud voice. We're back
[1:03:24] to Revelation 10 now. Revelation 10:3.
[1:03:28] And cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:03:30] lion roared. And when he had died, seven
[1:03:33] thunders uttered their voices. Now look
[1:03:36] what the thunders are. People want to
[1:03:38] make a whole another thing about
[1:03:39] thunders.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I I like the thing that brother Green
[1:03:42] told about the thunders too and the
[1:03:44] doctrine that was made out of that and
[1:03:46] the the the camera lens and all that
[1:03:49] stuff. I don't remember if all of you
[1:03:50] were there, but when the way he
[1:03:52] described it, talked about it and how
[1:03:53] this about uh this whole doctrine about
[1:03:56] thunders. But look, it's very to me it's
[1:03:59] very simple.
[1:04:01] Uh he cried, "Seven thunders, uttered
[1:04:03] their voices. And when the thunders had
[1:04:05] uttered their voices, I was about to
[1:04:06] write. I heard a voice uh from heaven,
[1:04:10] saying unto me, seal up those things
[1:04:13] which the seven thunders uttered and
[1:04:15] write them not." What did brother
[1:04:16] Brandham say? He said they were
[1:04:17] contended in the seals.
[1:04:20] Praise the Lord. That's why they had to
[1:04:21] be sealed up because it was not time for
[1:04:24] them to be brought forth. The book was
[1:04:27] open in Jesus' hand. Amen. She said,
[1:04:31] "The seals are open." Yeah, they were
[1:04:32] open. Jesus opened them. Amen. But when
[1:04:35] did they come forth? When did he bring
[1:04:37] them? When were they preached? When was
[1:04:39] it revealed? When was when are they to
[1:04:41] be broken? See, it's completely
[1:04:43] different thing to me. Amen. The angel
[1:04:45] which I saw upon the sea and upon his
[1:04:48] and and brother said, "Those seal those
[1:04:50] thunders were contained in those seals."
[1:04:53] Praise the Lord. Not not some great
[1:04:55] thing, mystery, something. No, it was
[1:04:58] just um a part of what brother Brandon
[1:05:01] had already brought us
[1:05:03] as the voice because the voice the voice
[1:05:06] of God thundering is just his voice. It
[1:05:09] is the voice of God going forth. When
[1:05:11] the voice of God goes forth, there's
[1:05:13] there's context to it. Amen. There's
[1:05:16] words
[1:05:18] there should be. When we speak as
[1:05:19] humans, there's context to our voice.
[1:05:22] There's a reason why we speak. If
[1:05:24] someone is synenographer or someone was
[1:05:26] there, they could take down every word
[1:05:27] that you spoke. Put commas and
[1:05:30] punctuation all words supposed to go and
[1:05:32] your words would be uh preserved in a
[1:05:35] book or or or in some kind of script.
[1:05:39] Well, when Jesus spoke thunder, it
[1:05:42] always did in the Bible. You go to Mount
[1:05:46] Si.
[1:05:48] When Moses went up in all the children
[1:05:49] of Israel there, he said uh God spoke
[1:05:53] and and all it did was thunder. Most of
[1:05:55] what everybody all they heard was
[1:05:57] thunder because the voice of God was
[1:05:59] just a thunder. This is this the same
[1:06:02] through the entire scripture. No great
[1:06:04] revelation to that. I mean we should
[1:06:07] that should be for us. Amen. Now
[1:06:10] Christian world I don't know but we
[1:06:13] should know that simplicity.
[1:06:15] The voice of God is a thunder. It
[1:06:17] thundered out. Amen.
[1:06:21] When they had uttered, see, seven
[1:06:24] thunders uttered had uttered the voice I
[1:06:26] was about to write. He said, "Seal up
[1:06:28] those things which the seven thunders
[1:06:30] uttered, right?" Told Daniel the same
[1:06:32] thing as Daniel began to get a
[1:06:34] revelation of that. And the angel which
[1:06:36] I saw stand upon the in the uh sand uh
[1:06:39] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:06:42] hand to heaven
[1:06:44] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:06:46] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:06:48] that are there therein are and earth and
[1:06:50] the things that therein are and the sea
[1:06:53] and the things which are therein that
[1:06:55] there should be time no longer delay of
[1:06:58] of no delay. Amen. It was time to bring
[1:07:02] forth. Praise the Lord. and God did in
[1:07:05] our day. But in the voice of the uh the
[1:07:10] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:07:12] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:07:16] should be finished. Now, a lot of people
[1:07:18] think brother Brandham sounded when his
[1:07:20] ministry started. Uh no doubt brother
[1:07:23] Brandham was inspired of God. He was a
[1:07:25] prophet from his mother's womb and was
[1:07:28] inspired of God to preach what he
[1:07:29] preached as he came up and as he spoke
[1:07:31] and God gave him voice. But brother
[1:07:34] Brandham himself said there are several
[1:07:37] there was things I don't remember if he
[1:07:39] you I'm trying to not say something he
[1:07:42] or say something he didn't say. He may
[1:07:44] not have said several but there was
[1:07:45] things he preached that the Lord
[1:07:48] corrected on him later.
[1:07:51] Amen. He says that himself and we know
[1:07:54] that's a fact about the seals. And and
[1:07:58] in fact at the time of the when the
[1:08:01] seals were actually open he said brother
[1:08:04] Brown said I was about to preach it
[1:08:07] wrong again.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; He says that himself.
[1:08:13] So when we look at this seventh angel's
[1:08:16] voice
[1:08:18] beginning to sound. Amen. To me that's
[1:08:23] that's speaking more not to discount
[1:08:25] anything he preached. Amen. Back in his
[1:08:28] early ministry, every bit of it is food
[1:08:31] to be stored, food to be eaten, food to
[1:08:34] be had. Absolutely. But when that voice
[1:08:36] began to sound,
[1:08:39] I believe was the time of his adoption.
[1:08:43] That's my personal opinion of brother
[1:08:45] Brandham's adoption. That voice began to
[1:08:48] sound and the mysteries of God were were
[1:08:51] unfolding and finishing at that time
[1:08:56] was when he was when God gave that
[1:08:59] voice. Amen. When so many of those
[1:09:02] things has happened. Why did brother man
[1:09:03] send it to to Arizona?
[1:09:06] Or why did God send brother to Arizona?
[1:09:10] These things had to happen. These things
[1:09:13] had to take place. uh the angels and the
[1:09:16] sword and uh the dove cove and all these
[1:09:19] things had to happen. The seals had to
[1:09:22] be open. God had but brother Brandon
[1:09:24] went back because he promised he would
[1:09:26] go back and anything like this and
[1:09:28] preach at the brand of tabernacle which
[1:09:30] he did. Amen. But all these things this
[1:09:34] sounding of this voice began to come
[1:09:36] forth. Amen. to solidify or
[1:09:43] the mystery of God being finished.
[1:09:47] Praise the Lord. Now, what does that
[1:09:48] mean to us? That means that those things
[1:09:51] that was previously hid are now
[1:09:53] revealed, now opened, now manifested for
[1:09:57] us to be partakers of, become a part of
[1:10:00] us, revealed to us as bride, as members
[1:10:04] of his body, as people whose names are
[1:10:07] in that hill. Is he standing there on
[1:10:09] one foot on land and one foot on sea?
[1:10:12] Amen. To us becomes a part to us. Amen.
[1:10:16] Brother Graham said how many times it
[1:10:18] wasn't for him it was for the people.
[1:10:20] How many times brother said that?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Several I don't I don't know how
[1:10:24] many. Several times he said it's not for
[1:10:28] me. It's for you. He was a part of the
[1:10:31] body of course but he was the instrument
[1:10:33] that God was using. Jesus would say the
[1:10:36] same thing. Jesus didn't go to the cross
[1:10:38] for himself. He went there for you. He
[1:10:42] went there for us. Amen. It was for him.
[1:10:46] This gift.
[1:10:48] Praise the Lord. I I mean any any gift,
[1:10:51] any position, it's not for us. It's for
[1:10:54] him. Is for us. It's for you. Amen. Th
[1:10:59] this this ministry, this is not for me.
[1:11:04] This is not for me. If this was for me,
[1:11:06] I'd still be in bed right now.
[1:11:09] Amen. Because I was very tired this
[1:11:11] morning. It's not for me.
[1:11:14] is for you.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; It's for him. All that we do, I mean,
[1:11:22] we do all that we do for the glory of
[1:11:24] the Lord.
[1:11:26] Everything, all of it. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:29] When this mystery begin to sound, all
[1:11:32] that when this voice begin to sound,
[1:11:33] excuse me, the mystery of God was to be
[1:11:36] finished as he declared to his servants
[1:11:37] the prophets. Praise the Lord, this
[1:11:40] mystery unfolding.
[1:11:42] Now, I I didn't I I didn't take
[1:11:45] completely in the way that brother Green
[1:11:47] would talk about this, but I do believe
[1:11:49] that of course there are prophets over
[1:11:50] there to finish for them, for the for
[1:11:52] the Jews. And as we've talked many
[1:11:55] times, that anointing going over there,
[1:11:56] we can read Revelation 11. We can see
[1:11:59] exactly what God is doing for his people
[1:12:01] over there. We know what's going on now,
[1:12:03] what's going to happen, but it's not
[1:12:05] going to fully come to light until this
[1:12:07] bride's gone. So what it means to us is
[1:12:10] the prophets that God gave to us are now
[1:12:14] finished. The the voices, the the
[1:12:15] mysteries. Amen. It's finished. It's
[1:12:19] been finished. Praise the Lord. We're
[1:12:22] looking for something else, friend.
[1:12:23] We're not I mean I I've said how many
[1:12:25] times have I said I have no new message.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; I have nothing new to bring you. I'm not
[1:12:30] looking for another prophet. I'm not
[1:12:32] looking for the Lord shows us some
[1:12:34] things in the scripture and things
[1:12:36] nuances that maybe we had not seen
[1:12:38] before uh or or brought in a different
[1:12:41] light or something like that to bring
[1:12:42] some encouragement of that. There's
[1:12:44] nothing new. Amen. There's nothing new.
[1:12:46] This message the message has gone forth.
[1:12:48] The message have been revealed. What we
[1:12:51] need what we need we have. What we
[1:12:55] needed to make a rapture God has given
[1:12:57] us. what we've needed to live in this
[1:13:00] life of victorious life and to go in
[1:13:02] rapture God's given us. It's been
[1:13:04] unfolded. We know that that mystery has
[1:13:06] been revealed. We know what
[1:13:09] what we know in whom we serve. The God
[1:13:12] serve the word that we that we that we
[1:13:15] have now. Now, so what does that bring
[1:13:17] it to our part? What does that do for
[1:13:20] us?
[1:13:22] A verse. and and the voice which I heard
[1:13:25] from heaven spake unto me again and
[1:13:27] said, "Go and take the little book which
[1:13:30] is open, and the hand of the angel,
[1:13:32] which standeth upon the sea, upon the
[1:13:34] earth, and I went unto the angel, and
[1:13:36] said unto him, give me the little book."
[1:13:39] And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it
[1:13:42] up."
[1:13:44] Praise the Lord. Now, John's a
[1:13:46] representative of us.
[1:13:48] We're just we're just the people here
[1:13:50] that are the partakers of what God is
[1:13:53] doing.
[1:13:54] John is the representative of that. He's
[1:13:57] just standing there watching this. He's
[1:13:59] seeing this unfold. He's recording it.
[1:14:03] He's put putting it down so that we can
[1:14:06] know what was going on at that time.
[1:14:08] Amen. As God revealed it and showed it
[1:14:11] to him.
[1:14:13] How how many things did brother How many
[1:14:15] things did God show brother Brown that
[1:14:17] didn't happen that very second? People
[1:14:20] so many times think that because they've
[1:14:22] read it, it happened right there. That's
[1:14:24] not entirely true. Sometimes God shows
[1:14:28] things that are years away,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; right? And these things sometimes these
[1:14:33] things are are in here what we see are
[1:14:36] are still down the road. Most of it I
[1:14:40] believe has happened or is happening.
[1:14:42] Some of these things are still for down
[1:14:44] the road. But for right now, what do we
[1:14:47] have? Us as John is that representative
[1:14:50] sitting there watching, we are part of
[1:14:52] that.
[1:14:54] And what he's telling us is
[1:14:57] he said, "Give me the little book." He
[1:14:59] took the book. He said, "Take it." God
[1:15:02] is saying, "Take it and eat it up."
[1:15:06] Praise the Lord. And it shall make thy
[1:15:08] belly bitter, but it shall be in thy
[1:15:10] mouth sweet as honey. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:13] Which it is. Amen. We take this this
[1:15:16] word into us and saying, "Oh, how
[1:15:17] precious it is. Look at that. See how
[1:15:20] God's revealed this. See what God's
[1:15:22] doing. See what God has showed to us and
[1:15:25] how we're supposed to live and how we're
[1:15:26] supposed to do." And we walk out that
[1:15:28] door and the devil slaps us in the face.
[1:15:30] It becomes bitter in the belly because
[1:15:32] now you got to live it,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; right? It's not just letters on a page
[1:15:36] anymore. Amen. It becomes you got to
[1:15:40] live it. And it's a hard and sometimes
[1:15:43] it's a hard life. It can be a bitter
[1:15:45] life. Amen. To live. It's not easy being
[1:15:49] a true Christian and living the life of
[1:15:52] a true Christian today. It's not easy in
[1:15:54] this world. You know that as much as I
[1:15:57] do. It's not easy in this world. It
[1:15:59] becomes bitter in the belly. Oh, it's
[1:16:00] sweet. You look at it say, "Praise the
[1:16:02] Lord. That's wonderful." Yes. Glory to
[1:16:04] God. Yeah. But then you go and live it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Becomes bitter. But see, that's
[1:16:08] our part. We are supposed to eat the
[1:16:11] book. We are supposed to consume the
[1:16:15] word. Let that word become us. Amen. So
[1:16:19] that it's no more me. It's Christ in me.
[1:16:23] It's the word in me. It's the word
[1:16:26] leading me. It's the word showing me and
[1:16:29] directing me. It's Christ. It's God.
[1:16:31] It's the word. Everything about it is
[1:16:33] the uttering of that voice because those
[1:16:36] words are simply God's voice.
[1:16:40] Praise the Lord. And those words that he
[1:16:43] spoke are life.
[1:16:45] They're life to us and we are to partake
[1:16:48] of them. Amen. We are to ingest them
[1:16:52] spiritually. Don't mean you throw some
[1:16:54] ketchup on this Bible and tear page by
[1:16:56] page. Spiritually, you ingest it. Amen.
[1:17:00] you let that word come into you and
[1:17:02] become a part of you. So yeah, when you
[1:17:05] go out here, it's not bitter if you
[1:17:07] don't live it.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's only bitter if you actually
[1:17:11] live this word the way in the context of
[1:17:14] this word. It's only bitter if you
[1:17:16] follow this scripture. That's when it
[1:17:17] becomes bitter because it's hard out in
[1:17:19] Satan's eating. It's not going to be
[1:17:21] easy for a Holy Ghost fililled Christian
[1:17:23] to live in Satan's eating, right? It's
[1:17:26] because the two are so diametrically
[1:17:28] opposed to each other. They're not they
[1:17:30] don't even have any similarities
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; and the majority is in the world.
[1:17:38] There's just a few that God has that's
[1:17:40] going to live this word that's going to
[1:17:42] be this word. That part of who we are
[1:17:44] that that word's becoming in us is that
[1:17:47] word is is living through us. And that
[1:17:50] portion that God has given us to fulfill
[1:17:52] in this life, in this world, that
[1:17:55] portion, that position that God has us
[1:17:58] fulfilling, that place is is like I said
[1:18:01] earlier, um
[1:18:04] I I had a great admiration for that
[1:18:06] brother I talked about back east, Mike
[1:18:08] orders that just passed away. Great
[1:18:10] because I just you could look at the
[1:18:13] brother and know he was a God called
[1:18:16] ordained song leader if there ever was
[1:18:18] one. And I haven't seen very many. I've
[1:18:20] seen a lot of song leaders or people
[1:18:22] attempt to lead songs kind of like
[1:18:24] myself that they're really not song
[1:18:26] leaders, but this brother was really a
[1:18:28] song leader. Amen. Finding your
[1:18:30] position. What brother? What what did
[1:18:33] the word say? What did brother Brandham
[1:18:35] say? You'd be blessed in your position.
[1:18:38] You you stay in your position, you'll be
[1:18:40] blessed. That's when God blesses us.
[1:18:43] It's when we're in our position. When
[1:18:45] we're in our placement where God's
[1:18:47] placed us, that's when God really
[1:18:49] blesses us. Amen. That's when we see the
[1:18:52] blessings flow and we see that word.
[1:18:54] See, that's our part. Now, 10th verse,
[1:18:57] he said, "And I took the little book out
[1:18:59] of the angel's hand and ate it up, and
[1:19:02] it was in my mouth sweet as honey, and
[1:19:05] as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:19:08] bitter."
[1:19:10] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:19:12] again before many peoples and nations
[1:19:15] and tongues and kings." Amen. Was to be
[1:19:20] our uh that's to be our position, our
[1:19:23] placement. Amen.
[1:19:27] Our portion. That's how we live that
[1:19:29] word. That's how we become that word.
[1:19:32] Now, I want to go over,
[1:19:35] we got a little bit more time. I want to
[1:19:36] go over to Genesis.
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:44] get into another portion if we can.
[1:19:46] Genesis chapter 17.
[1:19:50] Now we all know and have said we realize
[1:19:54] uh and of course going back to the other
[1:19:56] we can also go back with what we said
[1:19:59] several times uh when Jesus said if you
[1:20:02] say amen.
[1:20:05] God said here he him. Jesus said you
[1:20:07] speak. Praise the Lord. How do you
[1:20:09] speak? You speak because you've ingested
[1:20:11] the word. You become the word. When you
[1:20:15] speak, the word comes out of you.
[1:20:18] Praise the Lord. You say, you say. Now,
[1:20:22] re uh Genesis
[1:20:25] chapter 17, we realize understand we've
[1:20:28] said uh how we know Ephesians parallels
[1:20:31] Joshua. Now, I want to talk about that
[1:20:33] for a little bit
[1:20:35] today. We'll probably roll over into
[1:20:37] next week, but let's look at this to
[1:20:40] start as Joshua uh Ephesians parallels
[1:20:44] Joshua, the two as they come together in
[1:20:47] the placement. how Joshua placed the
[1:20:50] people, how Ephesians places the people,
[1:20:54] because remember we talked about even
[1:20:56] just a few minutes ago how they had
[1:20:58] their promised land, their actual
[1:21:02] physical stand on promised land. Amen.
[1:21:06] Then we have our promised land. Their
[1:21:08] promised land was Canaan. Our promised
[1:21:11] land is the Holy Ghost. Amen. when they
[1:21:14] got into their homeland, they struggled
[1:21:17] and they fought and they they won
[1:21:19] battles and they lived their lives. And
[1:21:22] when we got born again, you have the
[1:21:23] Holy Ghost in this land. We do the same
[1:21:26] thing. We fight and we battle and we
[1:21:29] struggle and we claim our land and we
[1:21:31] live our lives. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:33] Ephesians places us in that position.
[1:21:36] Amen. Well, we might not get to that
[1:21:38] today, but uh I want you to see when
[1:21:41] when Ephesians talks about the
[1:21:43] heavenlies and being in heavenly places,
[1:21:46] that's our position. Amen. How you get
[1:21:49] in heavenly places in Christ is being in
[1:21:52] your position. That's our position in
[1:21:54] Christ. Our position is those heavenly
[1:21:57] places or that heavenly place in Christ.
[1:22:00] That's that's where how we get there.
[1:22:02] Praise the Lord. But now, let's look.
[1:22:05] Let's start over in uh in Genesis
[1:22:07] chapter 17. He's talking to Abram.
[1:22:12] And he's given Abram these great
[1:22:14] promises that we know.
[1:22:17] 17. Let's start with verse six.
[1:22:20] God tells Abram, "I will make thee
[1:22:23] exceeding fruitful, and I will make
[1:22:26] nations of these of thee, and kings
[1:22:29] shall come out of thee, and I will
[1:22:32] establish my covenant." He had already
[1:22:34] actually changed his name to Abraham at
[1:22:35] this point. And I will establish my
[1:22:38] covenant between me and thee, and thy
[1:22:42] seed after thee, shall I say, spiritual
[1:22:45] and natural,
[1:22:47] thy seed after thee in their
[1:22:49] generations, for an everlasting
[1:22:52] covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to
[1:22:55] thy seed after thee. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:58] And I will give unto thee, and to thy
[1:23:02] seed after thee, the land wherein thou
[1:23:05] art a stranger, all the land of Canaan,
[1:23:09] for an everlasting possession, and I
[1:23:13] will be their God. That's their
[1:23:15] possession. That's their position. But
[1:23:18] not notice, we know Moses took them up
[1:23:22] to it, but Moses did not take them
[1:23:26] across into that land. Amen. He took
[1:23:30] them up to it. Praise the Lord. But he
[1:23:33] did not take them over. That was Joshua.
[1:23:36] Joshua took them over and divided out
[1:23:39] the land to them. We can go over to
[1:23:41] Joshua
[1:23:43] uh and read a little of this to start.
[1:23:46] It's uh it's way too it's way too much
[1:23:50] to read in church of the uh dividing of
[1:23:55] the land as Joshua divided the land out.
[1:23:57] It's way too much to read in church
[1:23:59] about it. But we can read the beginnings
[1:24:01] and the promises and it's God is now
[1:24:04] speaking to Joshua because Moses Moses
[1:24:07] brought them out of Egypt
[1:24:10] and and uh Moses took them through the
[1:24:13] Red Sea.
[1:24:15] But it was Joshua that took them into
[1:24:17] the promised land. Amen. Now you notice
[1:24:21] out of Egypt was when God was bringing a
[1:24:25] justification to them as we know today.
[1:24:28] hard place of justification is when they
[1:24:31] came out of the land just like the glass
[1:24:34] in the chicken yard to glass out of the
[1:24:35] chicken yard that's justification when
[1:24:38] they went through the Red Sea that was
[1:24:39] sanctification that was their place of
[1:24:42] sanctification just like washing up the
[1:24:44] grass it's becomes a clean it be it
[1:24:47] comes in a clean condition
[1:24:50] but it took the Holy Ghost Amen uh
[1:24:55] Joshua that took them into the promised
[1:24:57] land and divided out the land to them
[1:25:00] and placed them in their position just
[1:25:03] like the Holy Ghost does to the bride to
[1:25:06] us today. Places us in our position.
[1:25:10] Praise the Lord. Took him Moses took
[1:25:12] them up to that. But it was Joshua that
[1:25:16] put him in their position. Amen. Now
[1:25:19] let's look at Joshua. Joshua chapter 1
[1:25:24] verse one.
[1:25:30] Now after the death of Moses, the
[1:25:32] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[1:25:34] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[1:25:37] of Nun Moses's minister, saying, "Moses,
[1:25:40] my servant, is dead. Now therefore,
[1:25:43] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[1:25:46] this people." See, notice they hadn't
[1:25:48] even gone across Jordan yet. Amen. They
[1:25:51] came across the Red Sea, but they got
[1:25:55] stuck between the Red Sea and Jordan.
[1:25:59] Amen. You see, that's that's the same
[1:26:01] place so many people get stuck today.
[1:26:04] Yeah. It's the same place that Judas's
[1:26:06] chariot got stuck. He was just fine. He
[1:26:10] was sanctified, but he got stuck in that
[1:26:12] place and couldn't go on to receiving
[1:26:14] the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:16] They got stuck in this place between the
[1:26:18] Red Sea and Jordan and they couldn't go
[1:26:21] across. Remember, Jordan is death.
[1:26:25] Amen. You got to die to yourself before
[1:26:27] you can become born again.
[1:26:30] Get the Holy Ghost. Now they're stuck.
[1:26:33] So, they haven't even gone across Jordan
[1:26:35] yet. That was Joshua's commission. Moses
[1:26:38] brought him up to that point. But now
[1:26:40] it's Joshua's commissioned to take them
[1:26:42] across.
[1:26:44] Rise,
[1:26:46] go over this Jordan, thou and all this
[1:26:49] people unto the land which I give to
[1:26:51] them, even to the children of Israel.
[1:26:54] Praise the Lord. Now, can I say this
[1:26:57] real quick? If God's promised it, it's
[1:27:01] God's obligation to bring it to pass.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he promised it, right?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; It's his obligation, not ours. If God's
[1:27:13] promised it to you, it's his obligation
[1:27:16] to bring it to pass. Praise the Lord. I
[1:27:20] like that.
[1:27:22] I give to them, even to the children of
[1:27:24] Israel. They're not there yet, but they
[1:27:26] might as well be because God's given to
[1:27:27] them. And if God's given to them,
[1:27:29] there's nothing going to stop it. Amen.
[1:27:32] Oh, praise the Lord. If God's given to
[1:27:35] him, there's nothing going to stop it.
[1:27:38] Amen. Every place that the soul of your
[1:27:41] feet shall tread upon, that hath have I
[1:27:45] given unto you, as I said unto Moses,
[1:27:48] from the wilderness, and this Lebanon,
[1:27:52] even unto the great river, the river
[1:27:54] Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
[1:27:57] and unto the great sea toward the going
[1:27:59] down of the sun, shall be your host.
[1:28:03] There shall not any man holy to God.
[1:28:07] There shall not be any demon
[1:28:10] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:28:13] of thy life. You want to take that for
[1:28:15] yourself this morning. Saints, you
[1:28:18] watching, you want to take that as a
[1:28:20] promise to you? Praise God. I will. Not
[1:28:24] any man, no demon. There's no devil out
[1:28:27] of hell who is able to stand before thee
[1:28:30] all the days of thy life. Glory to God.
[1:28:33] As I was with Moses, so I will be with
[1:28:36] thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[1:28:39] thee. Be strong and of good courage. Now
[1:28:43] that's our part. God's told his part.
[1:28:46] Now that's our part. Be strong and of
[1:28:48] good courage. For unto this people shalt
[1:28:51] thou divide for an inheritance the land
[1:28:54] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[1:28:57] to them their adoption
[1:29:00] their positionally placed.
[1:29:03] Praise God.
[1:29:05] Only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:29:08] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:29:11] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:29:14] commanded thee. Turn not from it to the
[1:29:17] right hand or to the left. Well, you
[1:29:19] can't we can't turn to the left or the
[1:29:21] right because we've ingested it. It's
[1:29:24] become a part of us. It's who we are
[1:29:25] now. Amen. You can't turn from the left
[1:29:28] or right. And I can't turn from the left
[1:29:30] or the right of it no more than I can
[1:29:32] stop being a white man.
[1:29:36] Amen. The only thing that'll ever stop
[1:29:39] me is death. If life leaves this body,
[1:29:42] I'll stop. I'll still be I still have
[1:29:44] passed away a white male, but there's no
[1:29:47] way I can turn from one right or the
[1:29:50] left of it from who I can because that's
[1:29:52] who I am now. It It's who you are. When
[1:29:56] you ingest because you are what you eat,
[1:29:58] right? Have you ever heard that? I know
[1:30:00] my parents told me that when I was a
[1:30:01] kid. Amen. I don't know if we ever told
[1:30:03] our kids that, but you are what you eat.
[1:30:05] That's what they always said. You are
[1:30:07] what you eat. And a lot of times people
[1:30:08] have come to find out that's pretty much
[1:30:10] true.
[1:30:12] You you take in junk, you become junk.
[1:30:15] That's got to true nowadays. But you are
[1:30:18] what you eat. You eat the word, that's
[1:30:20] what you become. And then there's no way
[1:30:22] to turn from it. But his encouragement,
[1:30:25] God's encouragement to Joshua. Amen.
[1:30:28] Don't turn.
[1:30:30] Turn not from it to the right hand or to
[1:30:32] the left, that thou mayest prosper
[1:30:35] whethersoever thou goest. When you find
[1:30:37] your place, when you find your position,
[1:30:40] you don't turn from it because that's
[1:30:42] where you're blessed. That's where God
[1:30:45] blesses you.
[1:30:47] Amen. I just love that.
[1:30:51] It's just so beautiful. I mean, I had
[1:30:54] I've noticed that in my own life, too.
[1:30:55] And my wife, she's even told me before,
[1:30:58] you know, she said, "It seems like seems
[1:31:01] like we've been the most blessed when
[1:31:04] I'm in my place." And she's right.
[1:31:07] That's the truth. In our in our 40 years
[1:31:10] of marriage, you track it through, you
[1:31:11] can see where God has blessed us the
[1:31:13] most is when we're in the position we're
[1:31:15] supposed to be in. Amen. It's that
[1:31:18] simple. Amazing how people make it so
[1:31:21] complicated, but it's really that
[1:31:22] simple. Amen.
[1:31:26] This book of the law shall uh shall not
[1:31:29] depart out of thy mouth, but thou uh
[1:31:32] shalt meditate therein day and night,
[1:31:34] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:31:36] to all that is written therein. For uh
[1:31:40] then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,
[1:31:42] and then shalt thou have good excess.
[1:31:45] Good success. That's how you prosper.
[1:31:48] Praise the Lord. People want to prosper.
[1:31:50] A lot of people want to prosper. They
[1:31:52] don't want to do the work to prosper.
[1:31:55] Amen. Have not I commanded thee? Be
[1:31:58] strong and of a good courage. Be not
[1:32:00] afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for
[1:32:02] the Lord thy God is with thee,
[1:32:04] whethersoever thou goest. Amen. What a
[1:32:08] beautiful promise, saints. Amen. And you
[1:32:11] can continue on
[1:32:13] read through Joshua and you can see
[1:32:16] mostly especially like verse chapters
[1:32:18] 13- 20 21 uh is the placement uh placing
[1:32:24] them their adoption putting them
[1:32:27] positionally placing uh each tribe this
[1:32:31] you know tribe you're Manasseh dad
[1:32:33] whatever this is your land this goes
[1:32:35] from here to here and includes this and
[1:32:36] that and it is extremely detailed and
[1:32:40] takes takes a long time to read through
[1:32:42] u and is honestly kind of boring.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; That's, you know, it's very uh very dry.
[1:32:51] Uh but it but it's very specific,
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where God positionally
[1:32:56] placed them in that position and divided
[1:32:59] out that land. Amen. To them. Let me
[1:33:02] read this
[1:33:03] this quote here.
[1:33:09] Adoption number two. Then did you notice
[1:33:11] we'll say it as we go as we said here
[1:33:14] previously that great miracle performer
[1:33:17] that uh brought down Israel down to the
[1:33:21] land and brought them uh to the promised
[1:33:23] land but did not place their inheritance
[1:33:27] to them. He did not give them their
[1:33:30] inheritance. He led them up to the land
[1:33:33] but Joshua divided the land to the
[1:33:36] people. Joshua did. But notice the
[1:33:39] promise, the initial promise, as we
[1:33:41] read, was all the way back to Abraham.
[1:33:44] At the same time that God changed
[1:33:47] Abram's name to Abraham is when he gave
[1:33:50] him these promises that you and your
[1:33:52] children, you and your prosperity, you
[1:33:54] and your seed will will take this land.
[1:33:58] I have given it to you. It's your land.
[1:34:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:05] He says, "Is that right? And Christ
[1:34:08] brought the church up to the place to
[1:34:10] where their possession uh was made to
[1:34:13] them, was given to them, just the Jordan
[1:34:16] to cross." Again, hadn't hadn't even
[1:34:18] crossed over. And what happened? They
[1:34:21] crossed over Jordan. And what's the
[1:34:22] first thing they ran into?
[1:34:25] Jericho.
[1:34:27] Amen. Great huge walled city.
[1:34:31] Amen. You ever run into any situation
[1:34:34] you just think, "Oh boy, I got it made
[1:34:35] now." Then the next step you take is a
[1:34:37] big huge
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; something in your way.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to conquer that too.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever it takes. Whatever the Lord
[1:34:45] shows you, prayer. Amen. They had to
[1:34:48] march around seven days and all the
[1:34:50] marching they did and blowing the
[1:34:51] trumpet and uh sending in spies and
[1:34:54] Rahab story comes into this and the
[1:34:56] whole uh it just it's just phenomenal.
[1:34:59] But let's get back to our topic now.
[1:35:02] Amen. And
[1:35:05] excuse me.
[1:35:07] And Christ brought the church up to the
[1:35:10] place where their possession was made to
[1:35:12] them was given to them just the Jordan
[1:35:15] cross. But the Holy Spirit is the one
[1:35:18] who sets the church in order. The Joshua
[1:35:22] of today puts the church in its order,
[1:35:26] giving each one gifts, places,
[1:35:30] positions, so forth. And he is the voice
[1:35:33] of God speaking to the inner man that
[1:35:37] Christ has saved. What's that? The Holy
[1:35:39] Spirit. And he is the voice of God
[1:35:42] speaking in man. Christ that Christ has
[1:35:46] saved the Holy Spirit. He said, "Now, do
[1:35:50] you get it? How much of it do you get?
[1:35:52] Now, we're getting over into the book of
[1:35:55] Ephesians, which we'll read maybe if we
[1:35:57] have little time left, which we probably
[1:36:00] not uh get into Ephesians and look at
[1:36:04] what that promise again as we read a few
[1:36:07] weeks ago back to us again. Now, the
[1:36:11] same way he positionally placing the
[1:36:13] church where they belong. Now Joshua
[1:36:17] placed them in a natural land. Now the
[1:36:20] Holy Spirit, the church positionally in
[1:36:23] the land that they position that belong
[1:36:25] uh that they belong in in their
[1:36:27] inheritance and that Canaan land that's
[1:36:30] the Holy Ghost our placement. He placed
[1:36:33] them in their natural land. The Holy
[1:36:35] Spirit places us spiritually in our land
[1:36:38] in our position. We to play a part as
[1:36:42] that spiritual placement is. We play
[1:36:44] that part in a tangible physical way.
[1:36:48] Amen. As
[1:36:50] as we do in all of our lives and all of
[1:36:52] our gifts because the gift that God
[1:36:55] gives us, not for ourselves again, is
[1:36:57] for all of us. It's for everybody.
[1:37:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Not not just one person, not just the
[1:37:03] person that has it. Unfortunately, a lot
[1:37:05] of people take it that way, but it's not
[1:37:08] that way. It's for everybody. If
[1:37:11] somebody has a gift of, let's just say,
[1:37:13] tongues or prophecy or something,
[1:37:16] it's not for them.
[1:37:20] Sometimes, unfortunately, because gifts
[1:37:22] and callings are without repentance,
[1:37:24] somebody might use it to boast
[1:37:25] themselves up to something, but it's not
[1:37:27] meant to be that way. A true gift of God
[1:37:30] is operated by a true person of God. A
[1:37:33] Holy Ghost fil person is very humbling.
[1:37:37] uh and a person's very contrite about it
[1:37:39] and doesn't want any kind of accolade or
[1:37:41] any kind of notoriety or anything. They
[1:37:43] just they just want to perform and be in
[1:37:46] the position God put them in to edify
[1:37:48] the body of Christ. That's that's all
[1:37:51] the position all the places is is for us
[1:37:55] is to be edifying to the body of Christ.
[1:37:58] Period. That's it. No lifting up. Amen.
[1:38:02] Not to become famous or popular or rich
[1:38:04] or whatever, but to the edifying of the
[1:38:06] body of Christ. That's why it's all
[1:38:08] done. That's why we do it that way. Now,
[1:38:11] adoption, he says here again, same
[1:38:14] adoption one. Amen. Or adoption one, we
[1:38:18] just read two, a quote out of two. Now,
[1:38:20] the book of Ephesians places us
[1:38:23] positionally in Christ. what they was.
[1:38:26] Let me just background this real quick
[1:38:28] and uh we'll we'll probably read this
[1:38:30] next week.
[1:38:32] The book of Ephesians placed us
[1:38:34] positionally in Christ what they was in
[1:38:38] the holy land. We are placed not in a
[1:38:41] holy land but in the Holy Ghost. Praise
[1:38:45] God. That's what he's talking about. Our
[1:38:49] placement
[1:38:51] where we place positionally our position
[1:38:54] in Christ what is our position position
[1:38:57] God's give us is in the body of Christ
[1:39:00] that portion that we play for the
[1:39:02] edification of the body of Christ
[1:39:05] specifically mentions that in
[1:39:06] Corinthians about the the edification of
[1:39:09] the body the building up of the body but
[1:39:11] every position every the five-fold
[1:39:14] ministry is is singled out and but you
[1:39:17] know sometimes I wish it wasn't because
[1:39:20] somebody it seems like more of an
[1:39:22] emphasis is put on that. But every
[1:39:25] position, every person's placement is
[1:39:28] just as important as as any of the other
[1:39:32] uh uh brother Brandham held his position
[1:39:35] very humbly and it was an extremely
[1:39:38] important position. But look friend, his
[1:39:41] position in Christ in the body of Christ
[1:39:44] is no more than yours.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Right? He had a maybe a greater gift on
[1:39:48] this earth, but his position in Christ
[1:39:51] is no greater than any of the rest of
[1:39:53] us. And we look at it, that means just
[1:39:57] as much to God. It means just as much to
[1:40:01] the body. It means just as much an
[1:40:03] edification to all of us as any of the
[1:40:06] other gifts, as any of the other
[1:40:08] positions, as any of the other
[1:40:10] placements. It's just as important.
[1:40:13] Amen. It means so much to uh not only
[1:40:18] our children, our posterity, to our
[1:40:21] church, to our family, but to the body
[1:40:24] of Christ as a whole. Because remember,
[1:40:27] we are all part of one body. The toes
[1:40:30] not going to go in the rapture and the
[1:40:32] leg still be here.
[1:40:35] The ear's not going to go in the rapture
[1:40:36] and the rest of the body be here.
[1:40:40] When there's a rapture, the whole body
[1:40:43] from the bottom of your feet to the
[1:40:45] crowns of your head, every morsal
[1:40:49] meaning uh bit of your body is going,
[1:40:52] every bit of it, every bit of that body
[1:40:55] is going to be there. Amen.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; And this many membered body called the
[1:41:01] bride of Jesus Christ makes that body,
[1:41:05] makes up that portion. We're all a part
[1:41:07] of it. Amen. And every one of us have
[1:41:10] our part that we play that's just as
[1:41:12] important as all the rest of them. Amen.
[1:41:16] Notice again, Israel was never blessed
[1:41:20] when they were outside their homeland.
[1:41:22] You notice how Israel was always in
[1:41:24] trouble. They were always getting things
[1:41:27] wrong. They were always messing things
[1:41:29] up when they were outside of their
[1:41:30] homeland. But when they're in their
[1:41:32] homeland, and that's why they had to be
[1:41:35] driven back. We know because this this
[1:41:37] is happening now. Amen. Because that's
[1:41:40] where God speaks. That's where God
[1:41:42] deals. That's where they are blessed
[1:41:46] just like we are. When we are in the
[1:41:49] position God placed us, that's when God
[1:41:51] blesses us. Amen. That's when we become
[1:41:54] blessed. Not that
[1:41:57] we do it for that reason.
[1:41:59] Amen. But it just it's a residual effect
[1:42:02] of what happens when we're in our place.
[1:42:05] A residual effect of what happens when
[1:42:08] we're doing what God called us to do is
[1:42:10] the blessings of God in our lives. Amen.
[1:42:13] And I'm thankful for that. Praise the
[1:42:16] Lord. But we do it because we want to we
[1:42:19] want to be servants.
[1:42:21] We do it because we want to be there for
[1:42:23] others and to help others and to help
[1:42:25] the body. Amen. You say, "I I've had
[1:42:28] people I I'm ready to go." Oh, that's
[1:42:31] wonderful. Have you done anything?
[1:42:34] Listen, have you done anything to help
[1:42:36] the person down the road get ready to
[1:42:38] go?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Because you're not going without them,
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:45] Amen. God help us. It can't be anything
[1:42:49] selfish or self-centered in this,
[1:42:50] friend. We're all in this together.
[1:42:52] Amen. We're all a part a portion of the
[1:42:55] body of Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:58] We need that book. Become that word. Let
[1:43:02] that word live through us. Amen. Let's
[1:43:04] stand if we could.
[1:43:09] We live to our portion.
[1:43:14] We live to our placement.
[1:43:17] Amen.
[1:43:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:23] Amen.
[1:43:27] They seen this course.
[1:43:31] I like to mention the name. We all know
[1:43:34] it. I want to live the way he wants me
[1:43:36] to live.
[1:43:39] Amen. Maybe you can find it there.
[1:43:43] It's 493 in the book. If you're at home,
[1:43:45] got a book, you want to follow along.
[1:43:48] 493.
[1:43:52] Although probably all know it there too.
[1:43:54] So
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; it's our desire. I want to live the way
[1:43:58] he wants me to live.
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:05] I want to live
[1:44:08] the way
[1:44:09] he wants me to live. I want to give
[1:44:17] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:44:23] want to love
[1:44:26] love till there's just no more love. Oh,
[1:44:33] I could never
[1:44:36] out love the Lord.
[1:44:40] for you now. I want to live
[1:44:44] the way
[1:44:46] he wants me to live. I want to give
[1:44:54] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:45:00] want to love
[1:45:03] love till there's just no more love. Oh,
[1:45:09] I could never
[1:45:11] ever out love my Lord. Let's sing it
[1:45:16] this way now. I'm going to live
[1:45:21] the way
[1:45:23] Jesus wants me to live. I'm going to
[1:45:28] give
[1:45:30] until there's just no more to give. I'm
[1:45:37] going to love
[1:45:40] love till there's just no more love. Oh,
[1:45:46] I could never
[1:45:48] ever out love the Lord.
[1:45:53] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. I'm so
[1:45:57] thankful the Lord give us the way to
[1:45:59] live. Amen. He's put it in his word and
[1:46:02] he's shown it to us how we are to live.
[1:46:06] Amen. Our desire is we want to live that
[1:46:09] life.
[1:46:11] The truth of it is don't have any other
[1:46:14] life to live. I don't have any other way
[1:46:16] to live. I don't have any other way I
[1:46:18] want to live. Amen. This is it. Praise
[1:46:23] the Lord. I've said it so many times.
[1:46:25] I'll say it again. I've put all my eggs
[1:46:28] in that proverbial basket. And that
[1:46:31] basket is Jesus Christ. Amen. I have no
[1:46:35] backup plan. Praise the Lord. I have no
[1:46:38] backup plan. I'm just thankful that the
[1:46:41] Lord has revealed it. Amen. So that we
[1:46:44] could see. I think about the people in
[1:46:47] the world sometimes. Amen. Even like the
[1:46:50] guys on my team
[1:46:52] and I think, you know, if I'm wrong,
[1:46:55] what have I missed?
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:47:00] Getting drunk. Act like a fool.
[1:47:04] What have I missed? But if they're
[1:47:06] wrong, what have they missed?
[1:47:09] Oh my. I I I would rather I would take
[1:47:13] that tra day. That's uh uh that's a
[1:47:18] that's it's like a sure thing.
[1:47:21] It's what I guess they call a nobrainer.
[1:47:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. But I know in
[1:47:28] whom I whom my redeemer liveth. I know
[1:47:31] in whom I believe. Amen. Praise the
[1:47:34] Lord. And I'm so thankful for that.
[1:47:36] Praise the Lord. God richly bless you.

[1:47:46] strengthen you in the Lord today. Uh

[1:47:52] of course uh again, as we get some
[1:47:55] details, I'll let you know about Sister
[1:47:56] Lydia's arrangements. And uh be please
[1:48:00] be in prayer for one another. Uh,
[1:48:02] brother Dennis, I could tell just in a
[1:48:05] text, brother Dennis was uh struggling a
[1:48:08] little bit with his body. So, please
[1:48:09] remember him in prayer. He said just in
[1:48:12] a lot of pain uh having trouble. So,
[1:48:15] please remember him in prayer and all
[1:48:16] the prayer requests uh that we have.
[1:48:19] Amen. Lord willing, next week I'm
[1:48:22] supposed to, if the Lord carries him,
[1:48:24] we're supposed to go to California next
[1:48:25] week. So, there should be no need to be
[1:48:28] able to move the service time up or
[1:48:30] anything like that. So,
[1:48:32] we should be good there. So, God richly
[1:48:34] bless you. Amen.
[1:48:37] Micah is getting ready on a trip. He's

[1:48:41] couple services, but he'll be here next
[1:48:43] Sunday. Uh but the two Sundays after
[1:48:46] that, he'll be gone. So, I miss him
[1:48:49] tremendously when he's not here. But, um
[1:48:52] but next Sunday, we Lord willing, we'll
[1:48:54] come back to regular time. We'll have

[1:49:00] that we can give us uh his grace. Amen.
[1:49:04] Praise the Lord. Anyone have anything
[1:49:06] before today?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Uh no, not at all. Uh, I I feel more
[1:49:20] comfortable probably reading what you
[1:49:22] gave me than uh remember from my
[1:49:26] remembrance because uh I think I had
[1:49:29] like six drips of sweat on my phone as I
[1:49:32] was trying to read it when you sent to
[1:49:35] me. Not that I I'm very thankful you
[1:49:36] sent it because it was very encouraging
[1:49:38] when I read it. Uh but Sister Sheilia
[1:49:42] asked if I would uh feel comfortable
[1:49:44] giving brother Paul Sar's testimony. As
[1:49:47] you all know, brother Paul's been with
[1:49:50] cancer and has been through chemo. Uh
[1:49:53] this is uh the uh praise report that
[1:49:56] sister Shelia sent me on Wednesday. Uh
[1:50:00] praise she spoke with Auntie S uh Auntie
[1:50:04] Sister Margaret Sar last evening after
[1:50:08] eight weeks of chemotherapy.
[1:50:10] Uncle Paul's cancer count has gone down
[1:50:14] to 10. I don't
[1:50:18] I don't really know necessarily what
[1:50:20] that means,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; but I'm assuming it's good because you
[1:50:23] had praise hands.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Started at 5,000.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; 5,000. Okay. So, I'm guessing that's
[1:50:28] bad. Amen. So, it went from 5,000 down
[1:50:31] to 10. So, praise the Lord. What we're
[1:50:35] still believing is that one will go
[1:50:37] away.
[1:50:39] Zero. So, but praise the Lord. from
[1:50:42] 5,000. Cancer, his cancer count went
[1:50:45] down from 5,000 to 10.
[1:50:48] Doctor told him, "I could give you pills
[1:50:50] now, but everything has side effects.
[1:50:53] Let's see you in October to check
[1:50:55] again." Uh, praise the Lord Jesus. From
[1:50:58] five Oh, there it is. from 5,000
[1:51:01] which triggered leukemia diagnosis in
[1:51:03] December 23 uh to 5,000 two weeks later
[1:51:08] taking off leukemia uh to just cancer uh
[1:51:12] still death and strong chemo treatments
[1:51:14] all these months uh alternating eight
[1:51:17] weeks on month off uh 10 is very good so
[1:51:22] praise the Lord and as she said it was
[1:51:24] his 90th birthday so praise the Lord so
[1:51:27] God is good amen and chemotherapy, no
[1:51:30] chemotherapy, whatever it is, God's
[1:51:32] still the healer regardless. Amen.
[1:51:35] Praise the Lord. God is still the
[1:51:37] healer. And I'm so thankful for that. So
[1:51:39] wonderful testimony. I love Brother
[1:51:41] Paul, Sister Mark with all my heart.
[1:51:43] Such precious good people. Amen. I miss
[1:51:46] seeing them on a regular basis, but
[1:51:49] thank you for updated. Uh all glory to
[1:51:53] the Lord Jesus.

[1:52:14] know why my husband checked battery and
[1:52:18] cable

[1:52:28] backfire.
