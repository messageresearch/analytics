[50:15] start by introducing myself
[50:17] I am she has alluded brother Zephaniah
[50:29] papiso is my surname so I come from
[50:33] South Africa I met brother Roger Collins
[50:37] some 25 years ago in South Africa when
[50:42] he was busy with his Outreach 10th
[50:45] meetings there amen amen and we got to
[50:49] be glued together since then
[50:51] because I noticed that he had something
[50:55] that I had also he
[50:58] had a heart to get out and get out the
[51:03] Lost bring them back to the Lord and the
[51:05] Lord was
[51:06] using him so mightily out there amen
[51:10] hallelujah amen I'm so glad to be with
[51:13] you this morning
[51:15] I was taking a little video clip while
[51:18] my brother was singing the song there so
[51:21] that I can take it back home I'm so
[51:23] touched forgive me I like to cry a lot
[51:26] amen amen I'm so tired my wife
[51:31] actually bring greetings from her and
[51:34] from the old church at home amen she
[51:38] really encouraged me
[51:40] when I got here and I went I was at
[51:43] brother Collins church and they seemed
[51:46] to be hardly no one
[51:48] because we have bigger groups back home
[51:51] we don't have a pictures I'm not a
[51:53] person that has got the pictures party
[51:55] because it's a little bit bigger and
[51:59] she says to me after we took a photo
[52:01] with the group that was the church and I
[52:03] sent over to him she says to me that's
[52:05] right that's where you need to be here I
[52:09] thank God for it
[52:11] um
[52:12] just as a way of introduction I think
[52:16] I've done I came to know the message of
[52:19] the hour in the year 1983.
[52:22] the Lord brought him miraculously in
[52:25] each time I tried to tell the testimony
[52:28] I took a lot of time so I won't go into
[52:31] it because I value it so much so dear
[52:36] brothers and sisters and
[52:39] the Lord guided me supernaturally
[52:44] into accepting the message of the hour
[52:46] praise the Lord and our I grew up
[52:50] in the Assembly of God Church that's
[52:53] where I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus
[52:55] Christ when I was 16. and I became a
[52:58] young preacher in our church and while I
[53:02] was carrying one with the work of the
[53:04] Lord I came across
[53:07] message I actually heard from a brother
[53:11] that was with us
[53:12] he was also ashamed of God but he had
[53:15] heard that there was a brother pranam
[53:18] those days
[53:20] you couldn't even
[53:22] uh easily see a spoken word book but
[53:27] their brother used to write to many
[53:29] people to many places America and around
[53:32] the world so he happened to receive a
[53:35] few old spoken word books and he told me
[53:41] that this man William Branham had been
[53:44] visited by angels and we went into a few
[53:48] things
[53:50] um
[53:51] he told me about the baptism because we
[53:54] were trulitarians he told me about the
[53:57] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:59] which I had
[54:02] short time before that heard from the
[54:05] people that they call
[54:09] um
[54:10] Juanes group they call them Jesus only
[54:14] yeah so I added it from them and I was
[54:19] convinced that I didn't want to accept
[54:21] it so when he said he told me that and I
[54:25] said brother I understand
[54:27] so do you want to tell me now you're
[54:29] going to be re-baptized he said if there
[54:32] was someone to baptize me I would
[54:33] because we've been given God in pieces
[54:36] in three pieces one piece the Father the
[54:38] other piece the Son and the Holy Ghost
[54:41] he says but we didn't do anything about
[54:43] that one so we read and the first spoken
[54:47] word that he gave me was
[54:52] so I
[54:53] write up one and
[54:55] this time I read about brother Brennan
[54:58] or what he was saying because like
[55:00] I thought this man
[55:02] had this longing for God like I have in
[55:06] my own art I thought I didn't know yeah
[55:08] he's a prophet or anything but then
[55:12] um
[55:15] I stumbled
[55:18] over the
[55:19] seven Seed doctrine that's
[55:23] that doesn't sound all right but anyway
[55:26] after two years
[55:28] uh
[55:29] I happen to be
[55:32] I thought I wasn't gonna tell this
[55:35] testimony but I'll try not to take time
[55:38] on it
[55:40] what happened to be it was I come from
[55:43] the country
[55:45] if I talk country you think of a place
[55:47] that is a nice place with all the
[55:51] flowers the trees and everything my area
[55:53] where I come from is very very dry it's
[55:57] it's Inland in the part of South Africa
[56:00] that's called Eastern Cape that's where
[56:02] all the people that are still without
[56:06] all the
[56:08] modern things you know it's like they
[56:10] have mad Hearts they have all those
[56:13] things that's why I come from I grew up
[56:15] there and when I accepted the message
[56:18] did not send me back there so that's
[56:22] where I come from amen and yeah
[56:26] then I went to Johannesburg when I was
[56:28] in Johannesburg
[56:30] I was preaching on the farms for my
[56:34] sister lived in
[56:36] one
[56:37] so much fun and I was preaching there on
[56:41] the farms just getting people to know
[56:43] Jesus
[56:45] I happened to be in a hard time going
[56:49] through some trials and things so
[56:52] it was December
[56:54] 1983 I believed and I went and I went
[56:57] out to Cape Town traveling by trains
[57:00] more than close to 2 000 kilometers I
[57:04] don't know what would that be in miles
[57:06] I decided to fast for three weeks and
[57:10] asked a lot to give me a replying answer
[57:12] to all
[57:14] the troubles that I was going through
[57:16] you know as I believe I know the Lord
[57:19] will answer you amen
[57:21] yes sometimes you use somebody to talk
[57:25] to you and sometimes he uses even an
[57:27] unbeliever sure
[57:31] amen talk to me if I have dreams and all
[57:34] those things so for the three weeks I
[57:37] was just drinking water and not
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] not getting anything from the Lord
[57:45] while
[57:48] in the Train on my way back to
[57:50] Johannesburg
[57:52] I had a dream I was just sleeping during
[57:55] the day
[57:56] shop to a voice asked me in the dream do
[58:00] you remember William Branham
[58:03] do you remember the way he used to pray
[58:05] for his sins and the sins of his people
[58:09] said yes
[58:12] when I woke up I was standing next to
[58:14] the window or you know on the train
[58:16] thinking what is not telling me yeah
[58:20] is that maybe I must pray like we don't
[58:22] Panama what is it because it's for my
[58:25] Ministry to be successful on the farms
[58:28] then
[58:30] when I got to the family my sister lived
[58:33] forgot to preach at a certain gathering
[58:36] with people maybe
[58:38] three times this congregation
[58:42] and the Lord gives me so much I even
[58:44] remember the scripture today that I
[58:46] write it was in The Book of John
[58:49] where he says
[58:51] I hear other ships I have or other ship
[58:54] I have
[58:55] that that
[58:57] I must also pray if I don't know how to
[59:00] cut the scripture now but I must print
[59:01] that the throat fold with the one and
[59:04] the shepherd will do anything about that
[59:06] one right and then well an old lady was
[59:09] so moved and
[59:11] the next day I was on my way to
[59:14] Johannesburg because I was gonna go to
[59:18] Soweto the great biggest Township in
[59:21] South Africa in Johannesburg
[59:24] evangelist from Germany
[59:27] by the name of rain and bonke had
[59:30] intended up there and I wanted to
[59:33] witness all the Miracles that were
[59:35] taking place
[59:36] there but before I got there I met a
[59:38] brother in town in Johannesburg he said
[59:40] to me no no let's not call them and
[59:41] let's go to another meeting here
[59:44] us from America Kenneth hagging and the
[59:47] others so come to this one so I was
[59:49] reluctant but I ended up going with him
[59:52] what happened to me that if that last
[59:55] evening I was there
[59:57] there was something you know us the Lord
[1:00:00] was telling me that there's somebody
[1:00:01] coming to me to tell me something from
[1:00:04] the Lord
[1:00:05] so I stood next to the entrance as the
[1:00:09] people were coming in I was expecting
[1:00:10] somebody to speak to me nobody spoke to
[1:00:13] me
[1:00:14] when everybody sat down I would come and
[1:00:17] sit down
[1:00:19] service started after the service but
[1:00:22] the same thing still there
[1:00:24] nobody came
[1:00:26] I did it for three days
[1:00:29] the last meeting you
[1:00:34] know as the people went out I was still
[1:00:36] standing there waiting to for this
[1:00:38] person that will come to me it's
[1:00:40] something from the Lord which I didn't
[1:00:42] know in fact I'm skipping something here
[1:00:45] because when I left to my sister's place
[1:00:48] as I was going to the station
[1:00:50] catch the train
[1:00:52] her brother
[1:00:53] met me which I didn't know I just met
[1:00:57] him for the first place he said to me oh
[1:00:59] yeah are you the brother that goes
[1:01:01] around preaching the gospel and I heard
[1:01:02] from your sister and I love to know I
[1:01:05] said I'm going to joburg he says he says
[1:01:08] to me have you heard of William Branham
[1:01:12] I said no it didn't mean anything to me
[1:01:15] he says man it's just that now I'm
[1:01:17] getting to work it was about eight
[1:01:18] o'clock he was gonna
[1:01:20] stadwick and he says to me I pray that
[1:01:24] when you get to Johannesburg you meet
[1:01:25] the people that believe
[1:01:28] this message I think that's what he said
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:31] a message
[1:01:33] that last night in this particular
[1:01:36] meeting that we went to now
[1:01:39] I stood again
[1:01:41] nobody came they came and sat down and
[1:01:45] said he started after the service
[1:01:48] I said to the Lord I I spoke openly I
[1:01:52] said Lord I don't know who it is that
[1:01:54] must come to me I don't know what he's
[1:01:57] bringing if he doesn't come I'm also
[1:02:00] leaving now so I went out as people were
[1:02:03] greeting each other and that was during
[1:02:06] the time of appetite in South Africa and
[1:02:09] we didn't miss weeks with white people
[1:02:11] much but there you know it was a
[1:02:14] School location
[1:02:16] many were white people because it was in
[1:02:19] the white area
[1:02:20] and
[1:02:23] I just saw this one white brother
[1:02:28] and he looks at me even before greeting
[1:02:31] me he says
[1:02:33] he smiles and he says have you heard of
[1:02:35] William Brenner
[1:02:37] and I thought no I'm not gonna leave
[1:02:40] this one now I'm not gonna let this one
[1:02:42] go by I grab him with his coat and I
[1:02:45] said tell me who's this William brother
[1:02:48] he is a prophet of this generation yeah
[1:02:52] and we were taught you know in the
[1:02:54] denomination to be careful of false
[1:02:57] prophets and the other false prophet you
[1:03:01] know you you be careful of the false
[1:03:03] prophet you don't even know the true one
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:09] he invited me to his home he was a young
[1:03:12] man then
[1:03:14] I went to his home and came and picked
[1:03:16] me up and then he started sharing
[1:03:19] ah
[1:03:22] seven seats
[1:03:24] that I stumbled over them but when he he
[1:03:28] brought it up no I said God that's right
[1:03:30] man and I said to him how did it come
[1:03:33] through the ark during the time of Noah
[1:03:35] and he says to me Prada pranam says came
[1:03:39] through
[1:03:40] one of daughters-in-law of of Noah and
[1:03:44] foreign
[1:03:53] but I'm waiting for the Lord to confirm
[1:03:56] what the weather must be baptized I just
[1:03:58] didn't tell him I was waiting for the
[1:04:00] Lord
[1:04:01] and then
[1:04:03] a few other things
[1:04:05] yeah we were at uh
[1:04:08] some conference because I was already
[1:04:12] and
[1:04:14] go to conferences with the church people
[1:04:17] and across all the weeks politics and
[1:04:20] test things
[1:04:22] the next day I was gonna go now see this
[1:04:25] Brenham Church of the years
[1:04:29] and we went to bed say early hours of
[1:04:34] the morning about one
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:37] I'm not a dreamer but yeah there came a
[1:04:40] dream in the dream I'm seeing a swimming
[1:04:42] pool being a country boy this I wasn't
[1:04:46] even used to swimming pools and I see
[1:04:49] this swimming pool and to me even the
[1:04:52] fact that the walls of the swimming pool
[1:04:54] are painted blue I saw remarkable then I
[1:04:58] saw that and I saw
[1:05:00] green grass flowers and trees around the
[1:05:03] pool element
[1:05:06] so in the morning went into town called
[1:05:08] up this brother and he came with his
[1:05:10] friend
[1:05:11] that he was with when they met me there
[1:05:13] I didn't know that so drove all the way
[1:05:16] from Johannesburg to Pretoria and so
[1:05:19] I've passed the white area where white
[1:05:22] people live and pass the other group and
[1:05:25] then all the way into the colored area
[1:05:27] into a Community Hall there
[1:05:32] brother preach
[1:05:34] and I could descend the brother was in
[1:05:37] the spirit but I didn't know what he was
[1:05:38] talking about it didn't make sense
[1:05:42] I later learned that because
[1:05:46] Martin had a message that he made he is
[1:05:50] using all Prophet random status
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:53] and you know like he's speaking in
[1:05:56] tongues when you don't know the message
[1:05:57] he's preaching future day and ties up
[1:06:01] all the titles of brother Branham and he
[1:06:03] says when David came
[1:06:05] and
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:10] and they say oh he's so big
[1:06:13] he carries on it he says
[1:06:17] but he said oh the voice said don't look
[1:06:22] at him look away to Jesus and all that
[1:06:25] and when he came they gave him those
[1:06:27] things to where David he says he looked
[1:06:31] at me and says I look like an oddball
[1:06:33] and you know all those things he ties it
[1:06:35] together it doesn't so but after that
[1:06:39] were invited
[1:06:45] brother
[1:06:47] in town in Pretoria I'm the only black
[1:06:50] amongst these whites
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:54] while he's sitting there waiting for
[1:06:57] today
[1:06:58] sisters are busy preparing us some food
[1:07:01] he comes in from the is
[1:07:04] o
[1:07:06] from the Addison's Brothers
[1:07:09] do you want me to show you a pool
[1:07:11] where we baptize people that want to die
[1:07:13] to themselves and live for the Lord
[1:07:15] oh my dream last night I didn't tell it
[1:07:18] to nobody so I jumped to my feet and
[1:07:21] here I follow him to the backyard there
[1:07:23] is that identical wow I even have a
[1:07:27] picture of it amen the one I saw in my
[1:07:29] dream and I said Lord here's a
[1:07:32] confirmation what am I waiting for yes
[1:07:35] right the scriptures were open to me I
[1:07:37] still wanted the confirmation and the
[1:07:38] lord gave it to me yes
[1:07:40] yes and I said Lord please I said to the
[1:07:42] brother please baptize me here now and
[1:07:44] he says no brother after this afternoon
[1:07:46] service will come and baptize you hey
[1:07:49] and he delayed me to understand that I
[1:07:52] don't even remember our place in that
[1:07:53] service
[1:07:55] when I come to my memory comes back when
[1:07:59] we were standing there and he had given
[1:08:02] me he was a tall brother he still came
[1:08:05] down he's now 76 years old
[1:08:11] he baptized me there ever and when I
[1:08:14] came out of the water
[1:08:16] I thought Lord you're so wonderful yes
[1:08:20] amongst all people's needs
[1:08:24] that I thought I'm fighting so much with
[1:08:26] the African as the whites
[1:08:29] here this brother baptized me in
[1:08:32] Pretoria
[1:08:34] the capital of appetite and but God is
[1:08:38] wonderful praise the Lord but didn't I
[1:08:40] say I was born again
[1:08:41] when I was in the denomination
[1:08:43] but now there's a difference now yes
[1:08:46] the Lord had taken me up a step
[1:08:49] up so brothers and sisters that's how I
[1:08:53] came in and he baptized me and I started
[1:08:55] going to church I stayed in joburg for
[1:08:58] three years
[1:09:00] just
[1:09:02] getting to know the message and then I
[1:09:05] took it back out to the country to my
[1:09:08] people I thought when I got their
[1:09:10] brother there was going to be such a
[1:09:12] Revival
[1:09:13] everyone's gonna take it you know it was
[1:09:15] like I even met uh
[1:09:18] our late brother Lonnie Jenkins one time
[1:09:22] and I'm asking brother bunny how do I do
[1:09:24] it whenever I want to go out there and
[1:09:27] spread the message he said no foreign
[1:09:28] anyway
[1:09:40] before I went out I had had Brothers
[1:09:44] speaking about the message whoever
[1:09:46] speaks about um yeah
[1:09:53] and
[1:09:54] I will remember it now but it's talking
[1:09:57] about
[1:10:03] and time
[1:10:08] he talks about
[1:10:10] um
[1:10:12] this is where he he speaks about
[1:10:22] Souls that are in prison I had yet
[1:10:25] people speak about it I hadn't read it
[1:10:27] or listened to it but then
[1:10:29] we didn't have tapes then that we could
[1:10:32] really listen and brother Brenda when
[1:10:34] you listen to you who speaks American
[1:10:35] English is fast we hardly hear him and
[1:10:40] we used to try and get a book and to
[1:10:43] read and you know message
[1:10:50] but before I went out there back home in
[1:10:53] my dream I dreamed just the title
[1:10:57] Souls that are in prison amen and I woke
[1:11:00] up and I looked amongst my folks to see
[1:11:02] why is this one then I go when I got the
[1:11:05] book it it didn't just say source that
[1:11:08] said Souls that are in prison now
[1:11:13] then I read the book
[1:11:16] and what I gathered after reading that
[1:11:18] book is that now
[1:11:20] it was not like
[1:11:22] what I thought that I would give get
[1:11:24] everyone to believe it because it's
[1:11:27] going
[1:11:37] and I started church with my wife
[1:11:41] and my two little children one was about
[1:11:44] three plus
[1:11:46] four and the other one
[1:11:47] who played enough
[1:11:49] the other one is about three and a half
[1:11:52] or so I started
[1:12:08] of this have done now I am so glad to
[1:12:11] see you Brothers I'm glad to you when he
[1:12:15] took me up to Sabino Canyon and
[1:12:20] yeah I was so privileged that it was him
[1:12:23] that must take me out there and not
[1:12:26] anybody that's gonna twist his stories
[1:12:28] and that and you know I was
[1:12:32] my heart was very close to brother
[1:12:34] Peregrine I had met him about two times
[1:12:38] I didn't meet him in South Africa but I
[1:12:40] met him in Canada
[1:12:42] and yeah I saw attracted to him so I
[1:12:46] made him he was close to him and he
[1:12:48] tells me the things exactly the way they
[1:12:50] were so praise God Amen thank you very
[1:12:53] much brother and I was glad to see
[1:12:55] brother telling you for a tennis brother
[1:12:57] of pets the other day
[1:12:59] that had seen brother Brennan and told
[1:13:03] me if you must tell me more bro
[1:13:07] amen thank you very much brothers and
[1:13:09] sisters and then when I met brother
[1:13:11] Roger for the first time I went every
[1:13:15] time ministers came from America that I
[1:13:18] could meet I would go close to them
[1:13:21] expecting that they would have little
[1:13:25] what should I call it
[1:13:28] some blessing from The Prophet's
[1:13:30] Ministry and I was even expecting the
[1:13:34] Miracles some would come and he would go
[1:13:37] to places where when I'm all held in
[1:13:38] meetings when he was in South Africa
[1:13:40] Federal Market theater in Port Elizabeth
[1:13:44] and in in Durban grave or race course
[1:13:48] and all those places amen so now I would
[1:13:53] take this book we are pregnant medicine
[1:13:56] from God take another one a prophet with
[1:13:58] South Africa and look at the things that
[1:14:00] brought him the Lord did
[1:14:02] I expect the same
[1:14:05] and if you go there my brother I won't
[1:14:08] let you
[1:14:10] to just Bridge in Cape Town in Pretoria
[1:14:13] Johannesburg those cities I'll take you

[1:21:56] let all things be done decently
[1:22:00] and in order amen thank you
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:06] amen when when I read
[1:22:10] this
[1:22:12] seemingly little scripture
[1:22:14] it means so much to me
[1:22:17] amen that thought would utter those
[1:22:20] precious words
[1:22:22] to the Believers and say let all things
[1:22:25] be done decently and in order amen now
[1:22:30] when I'm not talking about order of what
[1:22:33] time the church starts who must break
[1:22:36] use cut instruments who must
[1:22:40] I'm not talking about how long the
[1:22:43] service smile I'm just talking about the
[1:22:46] order yes or the order of God you know
[1:22:49] brother Branham in one place says people
[1:22:52] likes water so much
[1:22:56] like I saw you Brothers lifting up and
[1:22:58] singing and carrying on the one who's
[1:23:00] saying hallelujah and another one Amen
[1:23:03] brother Brendan says some people won't
[1:23:05] tolerate that they think it's so
[1:23:07] disorderly right
[1:23:09] goes on to say what about Jesus is just
[1:23:12] order yeah
[1:23:13] he says
[1:23:15] on the ground
[1:23:17] and change that thing and apply it to
[1:23:20] the men's eyes and the man says that was
[1:23:23] his order yes but now yeah Paul is
[1:23:26] talking about the order in the church
[1:23:29] he found them he was new in the face and
[1:23:33] he found them carrying on they were men
[1:23:35] there were sisters there that were long
[1:23:38] in this way and Paul comes and all of a
[1:23:41] sudden he says let all things be done
[1:23:43] decently and in order amen it's so much
[1:23:47] reminds me of brother pranam
[1:23:50] because brother Branham you you know
[1:23:52] this story when he came to meet the
[1:23:55] Pentecostal people for the first time
[1:23:57] and he says he got amongst them you know
[1:24:00] the story and he says he was sitting
[1:24:05] not very close from not very far from
[1:24:07] the door and it's not when one woman
[1:24:11] stood up and started running and always
[1:24:13] all of them stood up and started running
[1:24:15] it up if anything goes wrong there wrong
[1:24:18] yeah I know where my car is and
[1:24:21] God is going to say
[1:24:23] him
[1:24:26] having that gift
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:30] all his life
[1:24:32] he says he saw these two men that were
[1:24:34] the one who prophesied speaking tongues
[1:24:37] and the other one would interpret and he
[1:24:39] says I thought after the service I'm
[1:24:41] gonna get this man
[1:24:42] I think I'm among the Angels here yeah
[1:24:45] so he says I spoke to the first one
[1:24:49] asked him ask him this and that and he
[1:24:52] says when I talk to him he rang 100
[1:24:54] percent
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:58] when I was talking to him I could see
[1:25:01] his eyes becoming classy he was feeling
[1:25:04] that something was taking place
[1:25:06] then he says oh when I left him I was
[1:25:10] saying what I'm amongst the Angels here
[1:25:12] yeah right then I thought I'm gonna get
[1:25:14] the next one he goes around and he get
[1:25:16] the next one and when he says when I
[1:25:18] talk to that one
[1:25:20] he says hi
[1:25:25] well I don't know but I don't have rice
[1:25:28] there's something that you all people
[1:25:29] have that I don't have I don't know
[1:25:31] whether he says well then there's the
[1:25:34] pool prophetam said no I've been
[1:25:36] baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:25:41] have you spoken in tongues problem no I
[1:25:44] haven't spoken it I said I will tell you
[1:25:45] right away you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:25:47] he says I kept talking to him talking to
[1:25:49] him like that
[1:25:50] he says brother
[1:25:53] when I talk to that one
[1:25:56] if you ever met a hypocrite yeah yes
[1:25:59] that was one of them right
[1:26:03] amen okay
[1:26:05] that's when he says I didn't know now am
[1:26:07] I among the Angels or among the Devils
[1:26:10] right yes but then the Lord later you
[1:26:12] know
[1:26:13] but now I amen I want us to look at this
[1:26:17] one that now
[1:26:20] Paul
[1:26:23] he's just came in and he tells these
[1:26:26] people if you read in in your in your
[1:26:28] book in this book of First Corinthians
[1:26:30] you'll get to chapter 12 where Paul says
[1:26:34] each and every one of the Believers has
[1:26:37] got a gift to Worship the Lord with amen
[1:26:41] he says in the the 12th chapter there
[1:26:45] some speaking tongue some
[1:26:47] interpretongues some you know there's
[1:26:51] about nine spiritual gifts and prophetam
[1:26:54] says those gifts are for every one of us
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:58] men and women yes children I'll say boys
[1:27:02] and girls
[1:27:03] says you saw all of us then they were
[1:27:06] going on carrying on in this 14th
[1:27:08] chapter if you read that they were
[1:27:10] prophesying jumping up and down just
[1:27:13] like what was happening when prophetam
[1:27:15] went to that group they were prophesying
[1:27:17] coming up and down and carrying on and
[1:27:20] here comes now Paul
[1:27:25] just above where I read you will see
[1:27:28] that now they had women preachers as
[1:27:31] well
[1:27:32] and Paul says
[1:27:34] they are not permitted to preach
[1:27:37] this same chapter he puts them into into
[1:27:41] order it puts them into order right but
[1:27:43] now brothers and sisters
[1:27:45] um I am so proud of
[1:27:48] our Prophet
[1:27:50] I want to
[1:27:52] or read from the book of Genesis chapter
[1:27:54] 1
[1:27:56] without taking much of your time I will
[1:27:58] read a few scriptures perhaps
[1:28:01] in the
[1:28:03] first chapter of the Book of Genesis the
[1:28:06] Bible says in the beginning Elohim in
[1:28:08] the beginning God yes created the
[1:28:11] heavens and the earth I say Elohim is
[1:28:13] because Hebrew says Elohim right right
[1:28:17] means the one who existed who
[1:28:20] Before Time When she said in himself by
[1:28:24] suffix in himself by himself now
[1:28:28] um in Hebrew if anyone knows a Hebrew I
[1:28:31] know a little bit of Hebrew it reads
[1:28:33] parachute that means in the beginning
[1:28:36] Elohim amen
[1:28:40] in fact Hebrew starts by saying instead
[1:28:42] of saying in the beginning God created
[1:28:44] it says in the beginning who created God
[1:28:48] um
[1:28:53] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[1:28:55] and
[1:28:56] now brother sister that's what what not
[1:28:58] I want you what I want you to hear now
[1:29:01] we were just reading and reading and
[1:29:03] reading and prophetam comes around and
[1:29:05] he says in the beginning God created the
[1:29:08] heavens and the Earth periods yes amen
[1:29:12] we didn't take note of that period in
[1:29:14] South Africa we say full stop right but
[1:29:17] you say period yeah and brother Branham
[1:29:20] says period is a space of time so
[1:29:23] between between verse 1 and verse two
[1:29:25] there was a space of time right
[1:29:28] hallelujah how long the space of time
[1:29:31] was nobody knows right it could be
[1:29:34] millions and millions of years between
[1:29:35] verse 1 and verse two right yeah yeah
[1:29:38] Hallelujah when we went up to Savannah
[1:29:40] Canyon we saw those roads at the station
[1:29:43] that they were showing us they say this
[1:29:45] Rocks video for millions of years and
[1:29:48] you kind of think millions of years
[1:29:52] I know did you know she's know what
[1:29:54] they're talking about they say you know
[1:29:57] in order to win them
[1:29:59] you just tell them you are right yeah
[1:30:01] because we don't know how long we've
[1:30:03] been here I mean this creation has been
[1:30:07] to us between verse 1 and verse two it's
[1:30:10] a space of time yeah and now
[1:30:13] when the Lord creates anything he makes
[1:30:16] it so perfect you agree with me amen he
[1:30:19] doesn't create anything that is not
[1:30:21] perfect right when he created you when
[1:30:24] you came into this Earth I know the
[1:30:26] scripture says we came into this life
[1:30:28] telling lies we were Liars but we became
[1:30:32] more layers
[1:30:33] we graduated in license we grow up right
[1:30:37] to understand that we needed to repent
[1:30:39] amen Hallelujah that's why the prophet
[1:30:42] says if if a child we cannot baptize a
[1:30:46] child a minor right right a little one
[1:30:49] we cannot baptized because he doesn't
[1:30:51] know between wrong and right yeah until
[1:30:53] we get to that he gets to that age where
[1:30:55] he can distinguish between wrong and
[1:30:57] right only gently baptizing amen but now
[1:31:00] as we grew up
[1:31:02] we graduated in doing wrong things you
[1:31:06] are not taught by your parents right
[1:31:07] right some of our parents were
[1:31:10] people that were Christians serving the
[1:31:13] lord so much praying for you but we we
[1:31:16] we did this
[1:31:18] disappointed them yeah
[1:31:21] yes we went our way
[1:31:22] until such a Time the Lord called you
[1:31:25] amen hallelujah now what I want to show
[1:31:28] us here is that we were so good in the
[1:31:31] beginning
[1:31:32] we're not as bad because the Lord didn't
[1:31:34] make us to be bad people he made us to
[1:31:38] be good people
[1:31:39] but
[1:31:41] between verse 1 and verse 2 something
[1:31:44] happened four if you read verse 2 of The
[1:31:47] Book of Genesis chapter 1
[1:31:49] and the Earth was without form and the
[1:31:54] Earth was void and there was Darkness
[1:31:58] is that beautiful no it's not
[1:32:03] God had just created the whole creation
[1:32:05] perfect
[1:32:07] and investor we find everything in China
[1:32:10] yeah
[1:32:11] without forming for that's not what God
[1:32:13] created it's not in the original
[1:32:18] it's not in the original state but then
[1:32:22] what has happened between verse 1 and
[1:32:24] verse two yeah
[1:32:26] something has happened
[1:32:28] to put all things is in such a chaotic
[1:32:34] yeah sin now if you read with me in the
[1:32:38] Book of Revelations
[1:32:43] you may 10 with me or you may read it
[1:32:45] later but I want to read in the Book of
[1:32:49] Revelations

[1:47:35] says this message to the angel of the
[1:47:38] church which is in Ephesus is not a
[1:47:40] message
[1:47:41] to the actual local efficient Church it
[1:47:45] is a message today
[1:47:49] and that age had in it the seed of Truth
[1:47:54] and the seed of Pera right exactly
[1:47:58] and set forth according to the parable
[1:48:00] of Wheat and the test sure the church
[1:48:03] age is the food and in it a wheat and
[1:48:08] test amen the first church organized
[1:48:12] humanized the government and the world
[1:48:15] what the true Christian
[1:48:24] what what I gather there now
[1:48:26] what was planted in the first church in
[1:48:29] the first church age
[1:48:31] is what
[1:48:33] is being
[1:48:36] harvested in this last age amen amen
[1:48:40] it's going to be wheat
[1:48:43] there's gonna be weeds yes
[1:48:46] now
[1:48:47] he says
[1:48:49] tears always flourish my dear
[1:48:54] or any other cultivated plant
[1:48:57] I don't know in my little
[1:48:59] little garden there where we don't have
[1:49:01] rain much I would plant some spinach and
[1:49:06] also some vegetables you plant it and
[1:49:09] you see that's sweet
[1:49:10] you hold the weight you take you you
[1:49:12] approach the weight and you did within a
[1:49:14] while you must do it again yeah
[1:49:17] is still growing yes but you must do it
[1:49:20] about three times right until you you
[1:49:23] have assume they flourish like that but
[1:49:26] you know the witch that doesn't seem to
[1:49:30] flourish that much
[1:49:32] and the problem says
[1:49:34] the chair Church grew rapidly in the
[1:49:38] first age but in which the witch church
[1:49:42] was flourishing also right by the side
[1:49:45] of that one by the end of the first age
[1:49:48] the Deeds of the Nickelodeons were
[1:49:49] flourishing in the local false Vine
[1:49:52] churches amen which increased attempting
[1:49:56] to to spread their influence further
[1:49:59] than their own body they were you know
[1:50:03] now
[1:50:06] in our time
[1:50:09] we see all these things going on
[1:50:12] bugs all we know
[1:50:15] is that our God
[1:50:18] has sent this prophet
[1:50:20] to say let all things be done descended
[1:50:23] and in order
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:25] you
[1:50:27] can go out there
[1:50:31] amongst all the people
[1:50:33] you know what is planted in your heart
[1:50:36] you believe the word of the Lord
[1:50:38] wholeheartedly
[1:50:40] amen you go out there amongst them
[1:50:44] you leave this message
[1:50:46] you do everything according to the way
[1:50:48] the prophet told you amen amen
[1:50:53] I had
[1:50:55] I was interpreting translating the
[1:50:58] message
[1:50:59] now I have my voice
[1:51:01] next to Prophet Venom's voice
[1:51:04] and even you know little things
[1:51:07] the people he says we create you this
[1:51:10] morning
[1:51:12] and he's the only one in the Pulpit but
[1:51:14] he says we yeah
[1:51:17] and when we
[1:51:19] translate maybe some in determine some
[1:51:21] into my language course or something to
[1:51:24] Spanish it fits so much
[1:51:27] we agreed you until those captains are
[1:51:31] so perfectly made that people will ask
[1:51:33] you have you seen them and you talk so
[1:51:36] much like you you you are on his side
[1:51:39] and brother if I may share this legal
[1:51:41] one when we were translating I would
[1:51:44] just take a manuscript read it write it
[1:51:48] in my language there right and while
[1:51:50] writing that something tells me that's
[1:51:52] wrong that's wrong right some reason
[1:51:54] it's as strong and I scratch it like
[1:51:57] that yeah if I could have helped my my
[1:52:00] mind is
[1:52:03] you're pushing I write it like that and
[1:52:04] something says it's wrong I scratch it
[1:52:07] back like that and I carry on and put
[1:52:09] the right one
[1:52:10] yeah
[1:52:11] there was a time when we first started
[1:52:13] the brother that was
[1:52:16] like leading us he thought I was too
[1:52:19] slow and I wasn't doing it and I was
[1:52:21] well they sent the manuscript to voice
[1:52:24] of God to to be checked and then
[1:52:28] by the way
[1:52:29] when brother Peter Paul met me
[1:52:32] he says to me what's your language what
[1:52:34] are you doing I said I'm doing awesome
[1:52:42] all those kind of all of those kind of
[1:52:45] clicks that we have he says brother they
[1:52:48] this language
[1:52:50] one of the languages that my father
[1:52:51] liked so much when we
[1:52:54] when those days
[1:52:56] it kind of you know mostly and I met
[1:52:59] brother
[1:53:00] Joseph
[1:53:02] because if Brenham says to me brother
[1:53:04] remember daddy said when you translate
[1:53:07] this message you must not live in high
[1:53:10] order
[1:53:11] and I thought he says do you know what
[1:53:14] my order is I said no no I don't know
[1:53:16] what that is he says I'll give you an
[1:53:18] example it's like the word pneumonia
[1:53:21] that is a Greek name pneumonia he says
[1:53:24] when you pronounce it it's like
[1:53:27] it begins with an n
[1:53:29] but when you write it it begins with a p
[1:53:31] but you kind of for me to repeat and
[1:53:33] send you one yeah
[1:53:37] translate that one
[1:53:45] Studio
[1:53:47] and problem is bridging
[1:53:49] you're preaching to the invisible
[1:53:51] audience
[1:53:52] somehow you go back to his time yeah
[1:53:57] and you visualize that until if he cries
[1:54:00] you cry
[1:54:02] you'll be so in the spirit and my
[1:54:04] brother while your other brother thought
[1:54:06] I wasn't doing it they the the
[1:54:08] translations came over and us
[1:54:11] number one yeah
[1:54:14] but anyway
[1:54:16] what I'm saying God
[1:54:20] comes around
[1:54:22] he let those Pentecostals do their thing
[1:54:24] there was a
[1:54:27] zusa Street
[1:54:29] there was Pentecostal churches all over
[1:54:32] there were Ministries all over
[1:54:34] they were doing so well and program
[1:54:36] comes around so he says let all things
[1:54:39] be done decently and in order amen and
[1:54:41] brother sister if you stay in love
[1:54:44] online my brother my sister
[1:54:46] God will bless you amen you remember
[1:54:49] that
[1:54:51] time program saw the preview of the
[1:54:54] Bride yes he says he saw me right I mean
[1:54:58] me yes
[1:55:00] in that Vision amen he saw you Prophet
[1:55:03] yep in that same vision amen he says I
[1:55:06] saw them
[1:55:08] the Japanese
[1:55:10] you saw them
[1:55:12] Japanese Pride was there
[1:55:14] African bride was that right yes
[1:55:16] American was dead yeah
[1:55:18] yeah all the members of bride were there
[1:55:20] and he says now Wiley they were marching
[1:55:23] so orderly
[1:55:25] he saw two or three that stepped out of
[1:55:28] order
[1:55:29] and I want to believe that he even
[1:55:32] forgot it he was in the vision
[1:55:35] when he saw those two or three I guess
[1:55:37] maybe it was me brother that was getting
[1:55:40] out of order and problem calls
[1:55:43] and yes
[1:55:45] Hallelujah right right because God
[1:55:47] brought him
[1:55:49] that things can be done decently and be
[1:55:52] done in order right amen
[1:55:56] I I don't forget this one I keep
[1:55:58] repeating
[1:55:59] that some sisters
[1:56:02] there was a quote that I asked my
[1:56:04] brother here to to
[1:56:06] wherever my name says
[1:56:09] we would like to be somebody else he
[1:56:12] says maybe I would like to be period
[1:56:15] and many of us ministers would like to
[1:56:17] be sorry and so so you could have us
[1:56:20] powerful Ministry and he says but you
[1:56:24] cannot take any
[1:56:26] amen
[1:56:28] right neither that person can take your
[1:56:31] place that's right he says some a call
[1:56:35] to be
[1:56:36] preachers evangelists and everybody and
[1:56:40] what but I like it when it comes to
[1:56:42] where he says summer calls to be just
[1:56:47] Housewives right
[1:56:50] and he said someone just called to be
[1:56:53] farmers and he even mentions mechanics
[1:56:56] yes he's a mechanics and these some this
[1:57:00] and you just be amen the light where you
[1:57:03] are yes yes it is this little one I'm
[1:57:06] telling that this
[1:57:08] three or four sisters were coming out of
[1:57:10] a store in
[1:57:12] cape and then this
[1:57:13] worker at the sources excuse me
[1:57:17] well you I want to ask you something
[1:57:20] do you know Jesus
[1:57:24] and they say oh well we thought she's
[1:57:26] going to push to us now and we said no
[1:57:28] yes we do know Jesus the message believe
[1:57:31] us
[1:57:32] and she couldn't talk anymore
[1:57:36] so they asked her back they said why why
[1:57:38] you just asked as if you know Jesus and
[1:57:41] you don't say anything he says why I ask
[1:57:43] you
[1:57:45] look like you amen
[1:57:48] I don't know what would that mean
[1:57:50] but it was such such a moving testimony
[1:57:54] amen that somebody can look at you and
[1:57:56] say you look like Jesus amen you look
[1:57:59] like him brother sister because the
[1:58:01] prophet came in our day so that things
[1:58:03] could be done decently and in order amen
[1:58:06] we have two groups I don't want to go
[1:58:08] into that but we have two groups now in
[1:58:11] the message
[1:58:12] we have
[1:58:14] people that are so legalistic
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:18] that will strangle you
[1:58:22] with the quotes of brother pranam and
[1:58:24] the the defenses of of the the Bible
[1:58:27] right that will make it as private and
[1:58:31] puts it a bunch of do's and don'ts right
[1:58:34] the message you know those guys will
[1:58:36] judge you
[1:58:39] before
[1:58:40] minor things yeah and they will take you
[1:58:44] out and say you won't make the ram
[1:58:45] charges that's right yeah I don't know
[1:58:48] yeah in South Africa there's preachers
[1:58:59] but on the other side
[1:59:02] there's another group
[1:59:04] in the message
[1:59:06] that is so Carefree
[1:59:10] amen so Carefree
[1:59:13] so
[1:59:15] Reckless yes
[1:59:17] that will really do anything anyhow
[1:59:20] anyway that will sometimes act as an
[1:59:23] unbeliever yeah yeah that will talk bad
[1:59:26] things through their own mouths true
[1:59:28] they also follow the message I don't
[1:59:31] want to talk about those that are
[1:59:33] denying the message and they make all
[1:59:35] the efforts to
[1:59:40] do not talk about that one but there is
[1:59:43] also that don't you think that now we
[1:59:46] must be in line amen we go don't go
[1:59:49] overboard to that side we're going to
[1:59:51] there are those you know I can take
[1:59:53] right now I'm
[1:59:57] I can take brother
[2:00:02] where
[2:00:03] I put brother Branham on that side
[2:00:06] brother
[2:00:07] they say brother I wouldn't have a name
[2:00:10] on this side and I brought the Lord
[2:00:11] Jesus on this side and take those things
[2:00:14] and see hey the looks uh they look so
[2:00:18] alike amen
[2:00:24] Jesus Christ was prophesied by the
[2:00:28] prophet that she was going to be here
[2:00:29] Amen brother Branham the same thing yes
[2:00:31] it's written about him in the Bible yeah
[2:00:34] he even tells of one time when he got
[2:00:36] amongst those Believers the the church
[2:00:40] people that he got to and he
[2:00:45] what did you say did you say your name
[2:00:48] was
[2:00:48] he says Brennan
[2:00:50] and he says the old man oh what's your
[2:00:53] name first name William and this is the
[2:00:55] old man took out
[2:00:57] a piece of paper in the openness that he
[2:00:59] says we were praying for a Revival yes
[2:01:02] and Lord spoke in the church
[2:01:05] said I'll send you image a Prophet by
[2:01:08] this name yes don't worry
[2:01:12] people will think that you you you are
[2:01:15] you are crazy yeah
[2:01:17] when you believe the message of the
[2:01:18] Prophet but you are not amen now brother
[2:01:21] pranam Jesus was born in a stable
[2:01:24] program was born in a shack
[2:01:28] Jesus sufficient sorted brother
[2:01:32] when he grew up Jesus was hated
[2:01:36] of
[2:01:37] those that were supposed to be on his
[2:01:39] side yeah so as brother pranam sure the
[2:01:42] little kids I think who is the Sunday
[2:01:44] school teacher I think that they are
[2:01:46] taught yeah you know all these things
[2:01:48] and now you know brother pranam says now
[2:01:50] he was walking from school with the
[2:01:53] other fellows and then there's this
[2:01:54] beautiful young girl he happened to
[2:01:57] carry the books for her and they thought
[2:01:59] you what are you
[2:02:02] because he was considered not even a
[2:02:05] white man yeah yeah he has gone so was
[2:02:08] Jesus
[2:02:09] because they said to Jesus you are a
[2:02:11] Samaritan yeah
[2:02:13] yeah you're not even a Jew
[2:02:15] Nam says
[2:02:17] they they thought that
[2:02:20] Mary went down and met as a Samaritan
[2:02:26] Soldier yeah and when she came back she
[2:02:28] had this big tummy
[2:02:30] and they wanted to cover up that admit
[2:02:33] make it a holy thing all right meant to
[2:02:36] understand Jesus was not even a Jew so
[2:02:37] they thought about problem oh
[2:02:40] you are
[2:02:41] go to it and you are when those boys
[2:02:43] went and then that hit him like that and
[2:02:46] say and then he says he ran to his his
[2:02:48] dad's house and he caught a shotgun yeah
[2:02:51] while they were saying we're guarding we
[2:02:53] got him they were talking like that yeah
[2:02:54] he comes with a gun he says which one of
[2:02:57] you wants to die first right so that he
[2:02:59] can he can see the others when they die
[2:03:01] so he tried to shoot
[2:03:04] but you know
[2:03:06] in his ministry
[2:03:09] our
[2:03:10] all these things but let me say this
[2:03:13] Ministry it was the first preacher
[2:03:17] brother Branham that I ever had
[2:03:20] in all his sermons he uses
[2:03:23] Bible verses
[2:03:26] and I look and I see in the Bible that
[2:03:29] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:32] had different sermons hear The Sermon on
[2:03:35] the Mount he said a communion he had
[2:03:38] different ones Beatitudes he had all
[2:03:41] those different sermon so did Jesus what
[2:03:43] did Prana pranam you know what
[2:03:46] in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:48] there was a time you read in the in the
[2:03:50] gospels that now
[2:03:52] they couldn't
[2:03:54] get the segment to wedges as he was for
[2:03:57] him to pray for discipline and it's
[2:03:59] written that they opened up the roof
[2:04:01] Ministry
[2:04:07] in one place
[2:04:08] they couldn't get brother Venom into the
[2:04:10] stadium
[2:04:11] the place was so full
[2:04:13] they had to take them and drop him
[2:04:17] inside here using ropes don't you say
[2:04:19] it's the same thing
[2:04:21] can you see that amen
[2:04:23] amen but it's just refreshed it's just
[2:04:25] the other way around it
[2:04:28] so now when Robin says
[2:04:32] Jesus Christ
[2:04:34] the same yesterday
[2:04:36] today and forever he means it sure and
[2:04:40] it's happening
[2:04:42] and many of the messages that he
[2:04:44] preaches it was what was taking place in
[2:04:47] his own life
[2:04:49] take a man running from the presence of
[2:04:51] the Lord is here amen
[2:04:55] take this daily scripture what was
[2:04:58] happening that was Christ again standing
[2:05:00] there there in in brother Branham
[2:05:02] creating that book yes like he did back
[2:05:05] then amen but rather sister if you look
[2:05:08] at all those things you comes to when
[2:05:11] one time
[2:05:13] you know the stories brother pranam says
[2:05:16] oh that's the time
[2:05:19] that we went to pray for that nail girl
[2:05:22] nail girls yeah you read in your Bible
[2:05:25] there's a time that Jesus went to pray
[2:05:27] for that girl from name
[2:05:31] name
[2:05:37] it's the same thing
[2:05:39] but now brother
[2:05:41] if you look
[2:05:43] when the ministry
[2:05:46] was growing
[2:05:48] and then
[2:05:50] Prada Branham
[2:05:53] laughs
[2:05:56] bear with me
[2:05:59] his ministry
[2:06:01] the ministry that Christ did in this day
[2:06:05] was exactly the one that Jesus In the
[2:06:08] Flesh did
[2:06:09] was exactly what Paul did in his time
[2:06:12] yes you know
[2:06:16] Paul
[2:06:17] will tell you that now there was these
[2:06:20] brothers that were helping him in the
[2:06:25] supported
[2:06:27] brother when I'm in Italy
[2:06:30] yeah not so amen do you know
[2:06:38] that's not just coincidentally
[2:06:40] that that is something
[2:06:42] and then now when the time came and
[2:06:45] brother when I'm lost his wife he lost
[2:06:47] his baby
[2:06:49] time now he was so
[2:06:55] pain thinking about this one time he
[2:06:58] says
[2:06:59] he went and he was doing his work at the
[2:07:02] Public Works he went he climbed up that
[2:07:04] boat and he says when I climbed out the
[2:07:07] pole and they were singing all a little
[2:07:10] far away stood an Old Rugged Cross he
[2:07:14] says I happen to look and I saw my
[2:07:16] Shadows there and the arms were like
[2:07:18] this
[2:07:20] he says I said Lord that was my sins
[2:07:23] that put you out there amen
[2:07:26] and you know what brother sister
[2:07:28] in our day
[2:07:30] brother William says they are crucifying
[2:07:33] him again yes yes right
[2:07:36] amen yes yes I didn't even realize that
[2:07:40] it would come to a Time
[2:07:41] when people would be crucifying him from
[2:07:44] the message prophets as well amen
[2:07:47] true and when he says I looked at God
[2:07:51] lord that was my sins that put you up
[2:07:54] there and I look at that one and I say
[2:07:56] Lord that was my sins that made you to
[2:08:00] be crucified for the second time
[2:08:02] that I may see this message right
[2:08:05] right it stood for it and it goes
[2:08:08] on and on until
[2:08:14] I get where I see now
[2:08:16] who knows Jesus Christ said those
[2:08:19] different sermons different people who
[2:08:22] was what was Jesus last sermon that he
[2:08:25] preached from the Bible any Bible
[2:08:27] scholars
[2:08:29] I might know
[2:08:31] which one was Jesus's last one
[2:08:35] thank you
[2:08:37] thank you sister exactly
[2:08:39] the last message that Jesus preached was
[2:08:41] communion with his disciples
[2:08:44] and now come around brother Branham
[2:08:48] what is this last one that he had
[2:08:53] thank you amen so
[2:08:56] communion with his disciples just to
[2:08:59] show us that this message is nothing

[2:09:07] you will do it forever yes this message
[2:09:10] praise the Lord and now

[2:09:22] not to that side extreme not to that
[2:09:26] side extreme but we stay in the middle

[2:13:41] these you run down that road you'll find
[2:13:44] me down there yes amen
[2:13:48] brother I'll
[2:13:50] our our meeting
[2:13:52] this one day I gave a lift to this young
[2:13:55] lady I was with my son
[2:13:58] I gave a lift to her will you go all the
[2:14:00] way we get to a place now
[2:14:04] okay I answered on the way I said
[2:14:07] what's your name
[2:14:09] she says her name is so and so
[2:14:12] I said no your name is Zuki
[2:14:15] he said no no it's not so it's okay when
[2:14:18] we went to drop by at the bus station I
[2:14:21] I took a number instead of writing the
[2:14:25] other name that she gave me again
[2:14:28] and when we got to Cape Town
[2:14:31] two weeks later we went to visit her
[2:14:34] home
[2:14:35] and she says to her and oh this is the
[2:14:39] man that I met that day I don't know
[2:14:42] okay I didn't know what it was all about
[2:14:45] when I'm about to leave the place
[2:14:48] she says
[2:14:49] by the way do you know people from my
[2:14:52] area where I come from
[2:14:53] I don't know anybody
[2:14:56] Jesus doing our soft shocked
[2:15:00] when you asked my name I gave you a
[2:15:02] wrong name Marian name is
[2:15:07] somebody just told me that
[2:15:09] that is something told me that your name
[2:15:12] was not that it was that one so brothers
[2:15:15] and sisters I'm glad to see you well
[2:15:18] yeah I think we all can say let all
[2:15:22] things be done in order amen I don't
[2:15:25] know how many
[2:15:27] maybe you're thinking of your family
[2:15:30] you're thinking of your loved ones
[2:15:33] you're thinking of all the people
[2:15:35] way
[2:15:39] back home
[2:15:41] I didn't tell you that I have this
[2:15:44] church out in the rural area where I
[2:15:46] come from
[2:15:47] many young people grew up in our church
[2:15:50] but when they come to Varsity level they
[2:15:52] have to go to Cape Town to the cities to
[2:15:55] get
[2:15:56] education
[2:15:57] and many of them
[2:15:59] get
[2:16:01] places where they can have a better life
[2:16:04] and we like the little church all the
[2:16:06] time but with
[2:16:10] raised up so many
[2:16:12] that leave us now I have that little
[2:16:14] church at home and I have one that has
[2:16:18] just started when I was taking the video
[2:16:20] hey I'm going to keep
[2:16:22] using or for twice halfway to Cape Town
[2:16:26] and in Cape Town
[2:16:28] I have another group
[2:16:30] in a place called Robertson four hours
[2:16:32] and two hours from Cape Town and in Cape
[2:16:35] Town in Canada
[2:16:36] there used to be brother Cambridge the
[2:16:38] old man he went to be with the Lord
[2:16:41] now I have that church also because many
[2:16:43] of the people that came from marches are
[2:16:46] in touch yes
[2:16:49] the biggest percentage in the church so
[2:16:51] I have those three groups
[2:16:53] to
[2:16:54] kind of of us here amen so may God bless
[2:16:58] you I thought I just said amen
[2:17:08] this morning
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:15] I was saying when the Lord left
[2:17:19] the Lord Jesus Christ said
[2:17:21] I won't leave you comfortness
[2:17:24] I will send the Holy Ghost
[2:17:28] Hallelujah
[2:17:30] when the prophet left the sin
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:35] comfortless
[2:17:37] he left us with the Holy Ghost
[2:17:40] he left us with a voice
[2:17:44] because he said if anything comes up
[2:17:48] if you doubt anything
[2:17:50] [Music]
[2:17:54] to see if I said it or I didn't say it
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:18:00] if there is anything my brother
[2:18:04] don't want God to come around
[2:18:07] and say in your own life
[2:18:10] that all things be done decently
[2:18:12] important
[2:18:14] don't you want to say Lord
[2:18:17] I want to make the rapture
[2:18:21] taught us
[2:18:23] if there be three
[2:18:26] or less that will be taken
[2:18:30] from this group
[2:18:31] saved by his grace Lord
[2:18:34] I am the first one
[2:18:36] in that group
[2:18:38] in those that are going to make
[2:18:42] by God's grace the Lord can come in my
[2:18:46] life
[2:18:47] can come in your own life
[2:18:50] we are out there brother
[2:18:52] still hunting for that little one
[2:18:56] for that last one that must come in
[2:18:58] before we go home
[2:19:00] and I recall problem says
[2:19:03] it might be one little black sheep out
[2:19:06] somewhere in Africa
[2:19:08] that will be the last one
[2:19:10] we are out there and we appreciate your
[2:19:13] prayers
[2:19:14] your support
[2:19:16] when we still go and do that we'll do it
[2:19:19] anyhow
[2:19:21] if the evil one is trying to close the
[2:19:23] road he won't blows the Lord is going to
[2:19:26] open the way amen so that we can catch
[2:19:29] the wind out there so that not many
[2:19:33] in this gathering this morning we're
[2:19:35] saying
