[0:47] often but it was on my heart yesterday

[1:06] ways i'm
[1:08] not sure looks like it's working praise
[1:10] the lord

[12:59] that would tickle our conscience lord or
[13:01] satisfy our spirit but something that
[13:03] would drive down

[13:36] he says and i will come near to you to
[13:39] judgment
[13:40] and i will be a swift witness against
[13:42] the sorcerers listen to this now
[13:45] i'll be a swift witness against the
[13:47] sorcerers
[13:49] and against the adulterers
[13:51] and against false swearers
[13:53] and against those that oppress the
[13:56] hirelings in his wages the widow the
[13:59] fatherless and that turn aside the
[14:02] stranger from his right and fear not me
[14:04] saith the lord of hosts
[14:06] for i am the lord i change not
[14:10] therefore ye sons of jacob are not
[14:12] consumed
[14:13] you can be seated if you like
[14:18] amen the lord give me a thought that i
[14:20] wanted to bring to you today i still
[14:23] have something that i want to try to get
[14:24] into that's going to take a little while
[14:26] to go through
[14:27] uh probably several months but i just
[14:30] haven't had the liberty to do it just
[14:31] yet i thought maybe yesterday when i sit
[14:34] down but then
[14:35] the lord took it a different direction
[14:37] so just trust me a blessing to you today
[14:39] however the lord leads or whatever his
[14:41] will would be but i want to speak on the
[14:42] unchanging god today
[14:44] the unchanging god
[14:46] it's very striking of
[14:49] that
[14:50] everything that we deal with and
[14:52] everything that we know and every person
[14:54] we know including ourselves and every
[14:57] facet of this world that we live in
[14:59] everything changes
[15:01] now everything is cyclical we know that
[15:04] and all the law of god still stays in
[15:06] place uh such as the grass the trees the
[15:09] animals things like that they all do
[15:12] what they do every year and in cycle
[15:14] they do it and it happens every year
[15:16] just like the sun the sun comes up every
[15:19] morning and sets every evening just as
[15:21] the earth turns and the
[15:22] it gets light and it gets dark that's
[15:24] the law of god as god said let there be
[15:26] and has continued on to this time but
[15:29] all the things that we see that changes
[15:31] all around us uh the government changes
[15:34] and people change and thoughts get
[15:37] better or sometimes worse uh everything
[15:40] changes but the one thing that does not
[15:42] change the one thing that is the
[15:43] constant is god he is an unchanging god
[15:48] and it's hard because uh
[15:50] as humans and we and we we grow up we're
[15:54] conditioned
[15:55] to uh to to lies
[15:58] uh we're conditioned to broken promises
[16:02] and
[16:02] and deceit and things like that
[16:05] uh we get conditions that because it
[16:07] happens so much in our lives we get
[16:10] conditioned as we grow up in this world
[16:12] that people are going to let us down
[16:14] and that things are going to go wrong
[16:17] and it things sometimes might get as we
[16:19] consider them or we say bad uh
[16:22] we're conditioned to to change we're
[16:26] conditioned to things evolving all the
[16:28] time and changing and and being
[16:30] different now than they were
[16:33] i guess i was getting a little nostalgic
[16:36] and a little reminiscent in my self when
[16:38] i started thinking on those things i
[16:40] shared with you a moment ago and uh this
[16:43] week for some reason i started thinking
[16:45] of my best friends when i was growing up
[16:47] and how good of friends we were how much
[16:49] time we spent together and i mean
[16:51] memories and things at times that
[16:53] friends i'll never forget just special
[16:56] times you know but all those things
[16:58] change
[16:59] everything is different uh
[17:03] being at the the tabernacle being with
[17:05] brother green for all those years was
[17:07] such a special time for me i love so
[17:09] much and you know but then things change
[17:12] everything changes the only thing that
[17:14] doesn't change is god god stays the same
[17:17] god is the unchanging god he tells us
[17:19] here i am the lord i change not
[17:23] so even though we're conditioned as
[17:26] human beings as we grow up to expect
[17:29] change and to know that change is going
[17:31] to happen and to know that we're going
[17:33] to change uh there was a time i didn't
[17:35] wear glasses it was a time i had no gray
[17:38] hair uh there was a time that uh i
[17:41] didn't have certain aches and pains like
[17:43] i have now and things in in our bodies
[17:46] things change
[17:47] uh and as they do it as we grow and as
[17:50] things get different uh it doesn't
[17:52] necessarily change for the bad it just
[17:54] changes
[17:55] uh because time continues to go on but
[17:58] even as we're conditioned to all the
[18:00] change
[18:02] the one thing the anchor that we can
[18:05] rest our soul on is is the lord god
[18:09] because he does not change
[18:11] he's not a god that he can lie he's not
[18:13] a god that he can change he's not a god
[18:16] that he can disappoint he's not a god
[18:18] that he would uh uh break a promise
[18:22] he's not a god that
[18:24] of any of those things now
[18:26] we in ourselves can get it built up in
[18:28] our minds to a certain way that if it
[18:30] doesn't happen a certain way we think
[18:32] it's going to happen we get disappointed
[18:35] but that's not god that's us
[18:37] that is our own imaginations our own
[18:39] feelings our own thoughts or our own
[18:42] opinions or the ways that we desire for
[18:44] them to be but that might not be god's
[18:46] will and if god's not allowing it to go
[18:48] that way you can assume and believe it
[18:50] is not his will because we desire and
[18:53] want the will of god and god continues
[18:56] to unfold himself but he's never changed
[19:00] god unfolds himself to us god reveals
[19:03] himself to us god opens his word and god
[19:06] lets us sin and peer into the very soul
[19:09] of the of who he is
[19:11] but that doesn't change who he is
[19:14] amen a lot of people uh and i think
[19:17] there's kind of a
[19:19] it seems like a a wholesale assault even
[19:23] in the christian world on the old
[19:25] testament
[19:26] it's almost like that
[19:29] it may have been going on for years but
[19:30] i've just noticed it myself recently uh
[19:33] where it just seems like that that even
[19:36] people i've known
[19:37] and christians and even people in this
[19:39] message will try to
[19:41] present the old testament to you like it
[19:43] it it's not relevant anymore
[19:46] but if you if you have a revelation of
[19:49] who god is
[19:50] and the unchanging god and god reveals
[19:53] that word to you and you can see him in
[19:56] it you can recognize god was just as
[19:59] much in the old testament as he is in
[20:01] the new testament
[20:03] god was reflected in the old testament
[20:06] and showing the types and shadows there
[20:09] as what he did in the new testament
[20:11] he's the same god those things do not
[20:14] change even from the garden of eden what
[20:17] we've talked about before when god
[20:19] himself made the decision that he took
[20:22] the blood of an innocent one to allow
[20:24] adam and eve to come out in his presence
[20:27] again god never changed that
[20:29] now we don't go and
[20:31] and and kill lambs like that or for that
[20:34] purpose anymore but the the fact still
[20:37] remains that it took the blood of an
[20:39] innocent one to be able to save humans
[20:43] to bring man back with god again
[20:46] it took that shed blood god decided that
[20:49] in the garden of eden it's never changed
[20:51] and it won't change
[20:53] because he's god
[20:54] amen now he did away with the daily
[20:56] oblation he did away with that daily
[20:59] sacrifice because he sent his own son to
[21:01] sacrifice once for all
[21:04] and that finished it well that's but
[21:06] he's still the same god
[21:08] people say well you don't go sacrifice
[21:11] anymore absolutely we do amen we
[21:14] sacrifice all the time giving praise to
[21:16] god with the fruit of our lips that's
[21:17] the scripture
[21:18] of course we sacrifice but see it's not
[21:20] the same it's not the same context that
[21:23] they talked about or they did in the old
[21:25] testament no we don't take animals and
[21:27] and take them to a chopping block and
[21:29] sacrifice them in their blood and all
[21:31] that they did in the we don't do that
[21:33] but we offer spiritual sacrifices see
[21:36] it's the same god god just magnifying
[21:38] himself god unfolding himself not
[21:41] changing he didn't change
[21:44] he unfolds himself magnifies himself
[21:48] because he's an unchanging god
[21:50] unchanging or uh
[21:52] unchangeable is the word that we know it
[21:56] is in the bible brother branham talked
[21:57] about is immutable
[22:00] god is an immutable he has the
[22:04] characteristics that we know that
[22:05] identify god i'm the present i'm
[22:08] omniscient all-knowing all-powerful uh
[22:11] immutable
[22:12] the immutability of god is the
[22:14] unchanging part of god
[22:16] he is immutable he cannot change god
[22:19] cannot have a better thought today than
[22:22] he had yesterday
[22:24] god cannot have a higher thought now
[22:26] than what he had
[22:28] two thousand years ago
[22:30] god cannot discover or find a better way
[22:33] to do something today than when he did
[22:36] it six thousand years ago
[22:38] because if god did something someone
[22:41] with a certain condition and some at
[22:43] some time
[22:44] then he's got to do it the exact same
[22:46] way today or he's not god
[22:49] our god is immutable
[22:52] he is unchanging he cannot change
[22:54] immutable is unchangeable
[22:57] or unalterable
[22:59] it can't even be altered
[23:01] which is a change uh anything that you
[23:04] alter is a change if you altered it's
[23:06] different than it was when you started
[23:08] but he's unchanging unalterable amen
[23:12] everyone everything changes but god god
[23:15] cannot change let's go back in the
[23:17] scripture here matthew chapter 24.
[23:25] now you babysitting there so brother you
[23:26] and i know that that's nothing new to me
[23:28] i i know that i've known that as
[23:30] this and i didn't expect to necessarily
[23:32] give you anything new but maybe put into
[23:34] your remembrance something you may have
[23:35] forgotten the significance of this
[23:38] because i want to get to something at
[23:40] the end of this
[23:42] the the significance of it because you
[23:44] think well
[23:45] why is it so important to know that
[23:47] god's unchanging well let me ask you
[23:50] this question
[23:51] and i don't want to get ahead of myself
[23:53] so i'll just give you a teaser
[23:55] why did brother brown a major
[23:58] major
[23:59] so much on hebrews 13 8
[24:02] that became the theme of his message
[24:05] hebrews 13 8. we'll read it in a minute
[24:08] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[24:10] and forever unchanging god why did that
[24:12] become such a theme to brother branham
[24:15] you know brother madam said that i
[24:17] looked it up in different variations he
[24:19] said that over
[24:21] 3100 times in recorded messages
[24:25] over 3100 and there may have been other
[24:28] variations how he said it
[24:30] but if you look it up same yesterday
[24:32] today forever
[24:34] 3 100 times he says it in recorded
[24:38] messages
[24:39] so when you think about something that
[24:42] was
[24:43] through that profit that was that
[24:45] significant
[24:46] it it bears
[24:48] a a second look
[24:51] it it bears
[24:53] us taking relevance to it serious
[24:56] relevance 3100 to where it even became a
[25:00] theme to his message
[25:02] it's got to be a reason
[25:03] why is the immutability of god so
[25:06] important well let's look matthew 24
[25:10] not done laying that foundation yet but
[25:12] we'll get to it matthew 24 35
[25:17] matthew 24 35 says heaven and earth
[25:20] shall pass away
[25:22] but my words shall not pass away
[25:26] pass away
[25:27] as in
[25:28] you would think being done away with
[25:32] but the word the word or words pass away
[25:37] if you go and you research certain
[25:39] things in the scripture
[25:41] to the the concordance
[25:44] uh many times most of the time a single
[25:47] word has a definition but there are
[25:50] sometimes depending on how much you've
[25:52] studied the bible
[25:54] there are sometimes that there's two or
[25:56] even three words that if you click on it
[25:59] amount to the same thing in the greek
[26:02] not just one word two or three words
[26:05] together pass away is like that
[26:08] pass away together makes up the one word
[26:12] uh i i can't pronounce it
[26:15] but it's p a r e r c h o
[26:19] m a i
[26:22] i wish i could pronounce it i probably
[26:24] could have taken the time to learn it
[26:26] but
[26:27] that's the greek word to pass away
[26:30] the two-word phrase pass away is this
[26:34] greek word this greek word is the word
[26:36] that brother branham used in in a future
[26:40] home
[26:41] when brother branham talked about and
[26:43] future home where it says heavens and
[26:45] earth will pass away and you go to i
[26:48] believe it's uh
[26:50] james or maybe it's peter where he talks
[26:54] about it being changed from one form to
[26:57] another
[26:59] not literally an annihilation
[27:02] see if you go into that scripture and
[27:04] you see heavens and earth will pass away
[27:07] well pass away it's not talking about a
[27:10] complete annihilation it's this greek
[27:13] word here that starts with the p this
[27:16] greek word here which means as brother
[27:19] adam explains in future home it means
[27:22] changing from one form to another
[27:26] heaven and earth will change from one
[27:29] form to another but his word cannot pass
[27:33] away or what change from one form to
[27:37] another same word
[27:39] same word as pass away here is the same
[27:42] word over in uh peter
[27:45] where it says pass away it's the same
[27:47] greek word
[27:49] change from one form not annihilation
[27:52] it's not saying annihilation heaven and
[27:54] earth will it's not talking about being
[27:56] annihilated but it's talking about being
[27:59] changed
[28:01] heaven and earth
[28:02] shall
[28:03] uh
[28:04] shall change
[28:06] but my word shall not change
[28:09] pass away change from one form to
[28:12] another now why is it significance
[28:15] because god is the word
[28:17] amen god is the word the word is god the
[28:20] word is christ and if he can't change
[28:23] then how can his word change
[28:26] used to be and i've said this many times
[28:27] but he used to be and i was growing up
[28:29] and back uh
[28:31] probably even further back to the end
[28:33] your word was your bond
[28:35] now there are certain people you can
[28:36] still have that that agreement with a
[28:40] handshake a promise
[28:42] a word spoken
[28:44] was something you could you could anchor
[28:47] yourself on
[28:48] because that person was as good as their
[28:50] word if they told you they were going to
[28:52] do something
[28:53] they were going to do it
[28:56] amen unless
[28:57] some catastrophic unforeseen
[28:59] circumstances came about
[29:01] they were going to honor their word
[29:05] because well where do you think that
[29:06] comes from what comes from the root of
[29:09] this country being established in
[29:11] christianity and the root of this
[29:14] country being established in
[29:15] christianity it it uh
[29:19] it developed
[29:21] its values
[29:23] the values of this nation what it was
[29:26] founded on the values of it was founded
[29:28] on the scripture
[29:30] the bible
[29:32] there's many parts of our
[29:35] of our laws that are on the books today
[29:39] federally and statewide that are
[29:42] scriptural principles
[29:44] now there'll be a lot of people and
[29:45] atheists and whatever that'll try to
[29:49] get you and sways you from that get you
[29:51] away from that but the fact of the
[29:53] matter is thou shalt not lie is in the
[29:56] bible
[29:57] thou shalt not steal is in the bible
[30:01] well that's still a
[30:02] that's still a law that are on the books
[30:05] today as much as people are violating it
[30:07] it's still against the law to steal
[30:10] something that doesn't belong to you
[30:13] well that's rooted in the principles of
[30:15] the scripture
[30:18] that's what
[30:19] that's what
[30:20] maybe i shouldn't say this but that's
[30:22] kind of what gets me sometimes when uh
[30:25] when you see the the nation
[30:27] when we do certain things that we do
[30:29] with other countries
[30:31] uh we go and we we handshake with a
[30:34] russia or a china or an iran who would
[30:38] rather kill us than be shaking our hands
[30:41] and we we accept their promise that
[30:44] they're not going to or they're going to
[30:46] do something
[30:48] when you're dealing with
[30:49] non-christian
[30:51] non-moraled
[30:53] people that just would assume lie to you
[30:56] as they tell you the truth
[30:58] they don't care
[31:00] and we depend on the we we depend on
[31:02] their well he said he wouldn't do this
[31:05] what does that matter
[31:08] that in five bucks you get your cup of
[31:10] coffee at starbucks
[31:12] it means nothing
[31:14] not worth the paper it's written on
[31:16] and we depend on it all the time and i
[31:18] understand people say well you gotta you
[31:21] gotta depend on what they're saying
[31:22] but as the fundamental foundation of our
[31:25] country
[31:27] and and in respects to its leadership
[31:29] and its citizens
[31:31] we are responsible for our own
[31:34] the bible says that charity beginning at
[31:38] home
[31:40] how can you help someone else if you
[31:43] yourself are despondent
[31:46] if you are destitute if you are broke if
[31:50] you are morally bankrupt how are you
[31:52] ever going to help somebody else
[31:55] let me help you reach this moral
[31:58] superiority when you yourself are so
[32:00] immoral it's not even funny
[32:04] well that's what we do
[32:07] let's lift you up to these great heights
[32:09] first of all they don't want to be
[32:10] lifted up because they're happy who they
[32:12] are
[32:13] stealing plunging killing murdering is
[32:16] still
[32:17] bombing babies and women and children as
[32:20] much as they can over there
[32:22] ukraine right now we continue to
[32:23] remember obviously those believers those
[32:26] people in prayer
[32:27] amen russia and ukraine but
[32:31] they don't care you understand
[32:34] and and for them to say oh
[32:37] we'll do this this and this and and we
[32:39] and this country this leadership anchor
[32:42] our
[32:44] what we do on that
[32:47] when
[32:47] life to them is nothing
[32:51] lying doesn't mean anything those
[32:54] those people aren't rooted in what we're
[32:56] rooted in
[32:57] we look at it and think hey a man should
[32:59] be as good as his word well that's god
[33:03] god is only as good as his word because
[33:05] he is his word and in fact truth is we
[33:08] are our word
[33:10] what comes out of your mouth is a
[33:12] representation of who you are
[33:15] and if you speak that you are that
[33:19] because that's who we that's who that's
[33:21] what the representation of us is what we
[33:24] say
[33:25] what we say what we do that's who we are
[33:28] well god's the same ways he is his word
[33:31] well if his word can't change
[33:33] how can he change
[33:35] if he can't change how can his word
[33:37] change
[33:39] well his word can't change
[33:41] praise the lord thank god for that
[33:43] saints amen again because that brings us
[33:46] to the point of understanding
[33:49] amen that god is immutable
[33:52] that god does not change
[33:54] hebrews 13 8
[33:58] let's look at this
[34:01] we know it
[34:03] yeah
[34:05] sometimes we misquote it a little bit
[34:07] but right
[34:12] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ
[34:15] the same yesterday
[34:17] and today
[34:19] and forever
[34:21] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[34:24] and forever years ago i was when the
[34:27] internet thing was just starting and it
[34:28] was getting to be a big thing and they
[34:30] had these chat rooms you know every ever
[34:32] back then you ever did the chat room
[34:34] thing back
[34:36] not not anything close to what it like
[34:37] it is now
[34:39] uh
[34:39] just
[34:40] it was just a little room where
[34:42] people's names and a sentence would come
[34:45] up and people could type i was a
[34:46] horrible type it take me half hour just
[34:49] type jesus where's the j
[34:52] and then and i learned to type because
[34:54] of that
[34:55] but it takes forever
[34:58] i would try to answer a question and i'm
[35:00] sitting here trying to type
[35:02] and five and ten other people have
[35:04] already said stuff they've already moved
[35:06] on to a different subject
[35:08] i'm finally done
[35:10] well
[35:11] what's the point of that but
[35:14] one of the things that i have put in
[35:16] there this was a christian chat room
[35:19] these people were supposed to be
[35:20] christians
[35:21] and
[35:24] one of the things i was telling them in
[35:27] in reference to what they were speaking
[35:28] about was but jeep because of how things
[35:33] change and see that's what most churches
[35:35] want to teach you you know let's just
[35:37] roll with the changes
[35:39] just go with the changes let's update
[35:41] our churches let's update our music
[35:44] let's bring rock and roll in or jazz
[35:46] whatever it is we'll we'll update our
[35:47] music well okay to satisfy the older
[35:51] congregation
[35:53] like
[35:54] it's an oldophobia or something oh is
[35:56] that a word
[35:58] they got a phobia for everything so i
[36:00] guess there's the old phobia we'll just
[36:02] satisfy our patronize the old people and
[36:05] we'll have a contemporary or a
[36:07] traditional service for them
[36:10] so now a lot of churches they have
[36:12] uh two morning services a contemporary
[36:15] service where they play the rock music
[36:16] and probably ever hardly mention the
[36:18] name jesus and then they have a
[36:19] traditional service for the old people
[36:22] because you got to change
[36:24] we want to get all the young people in
[36:26] well you want to get a young you want to
[36:28] get young people in that are that are
[36:30] going to be christians and born again
[36:31] and ready for a rapture you need to
[36:33] preach in the word of god and teach them
[36:35] exactly how they're supposed to be
[36:38] not feed them rock and roll and
[36:41] tattooing
[36:43] tattoos are okay
[36:45] you know that's
[36:47] everything becomes okay
[36:50] but it doesn't my god doesn't care about
[36:53] that yes he does if he didn't it
[36:56] wouldn't be in his word
[36:58] and that's the problem people don't
[37:02] i dares to say most people have no idea
[37:05] what the scripture even says about
[37:08] god have mercy on the man the minister
[37:11] that would tell a young person that it's
[37:13] okay to scar your body like that
[37:17] because they're the ones that should
[37:19] know the scripture well they all should
[37:22] but getting it because that kid he's not
[37:24] going to look in the bible for himself
[37:26] he doesn't know he's depending on that
[37:28] spiritual leader to tell him
[37:30] on it's okay
[37:32] it's okay to do this it's okay to have
[37:34] this kind of lifestyle and live this
[37:36] kind of way and friend
[37:37] but that's just the way it is
[37:39] it's rolling with the changes
[37:42] we'll just keep up with the changes
[37:44] amen no we just need to obey what he's
[37:47] given us
[37:50] obey what he's got for us
[37:53] that's what we need to do not just not
[37:55] change everything to suit us
[37:57] but that's exactly what people do they
[38:00] change everything to suit us but jesus
[38:02] christ is the same yesterday today and
[38:05] forever now
[38:06] if he was the same then
[38:08] as he is today and i was telling this
[38:10] person that chat room i put in there
[38:12] because they were talking about the
[38:13] changes i said
[38:15] but the bible says hebrews 13 8 jesus
[38:18] christ the same yesterday today and
[38:19] forever he said oh that that that
[38:22] doesn't uh count for today or something
[38:24] like that just he
[38:26] dispelled it somehow i don't remember
[38:28] exactly what it was a long time ago
[38:30] i don't remember what what they said to
[38:33] to throw it all for the spiritual i said
[38:35] that's the scripture
[38:36] that's the bible you either believe the
[38:38] bible which is the word of god which is
[38:40] god himself or you don't
[38:41] right
[38:43] it's your choice
[38:44] but even even then was
[38:48] nullifying the scripture jesus christ is
[38:52] saved yesterday today and forever well
[38:53] if he hated it yesterday he hates it
[38:55] today
[38:57] if he hates it today he's gonna hate it
[38:58] tomorrow if god loves something
[39:01] yesterday he loves it today
[39:03] and if he loves it today he's gonna love
[39:05] it tomorrow because it's god
[39:07] if god asks for one thing one day he's
[39:09] not gonna ask a different today it's the
[39:11] same today
[39:13] it's today it'll be the same tomorrow
[39:16] that brings me to my theme
[39:19] why is this so important
[39:22] why is it so significant that we get
[39:24] that real doubt deep in our soul
[39:27] revelation
[39:28] of what of the immutability of god
[39:32] that the that god does not change why
[39:35] did brother branham hammer it so hard
[39:38] especially
[39:40] now this may give you the clue you may
[39:42] already know it
[39:43] this may give you the clue especially
[39:46] during
[39:47] prayer line services
[39:50] where it had prayer line of people
[39:51] coming up and need healing
[39:53] he would emphasize jesus christ the same
[39:56] yesterday today and forever
[39:58] especially when he had prayer lines
[40:01] 3 100 over 3 100 times brother branham
[40:06] makes this statement in recorded in his
[40:10] recorded ministry 3100
[40:14] why would he do that
[40:17] why would he make i mean outside of only
[40:19] believe
[40:20] why would he make the theme of his
[40:22] message hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the
[40:26] same yesterday today and forever
[40:29] one reason to me now there could have
[40:32] been others but one significant reason
[40:34] to me
[40:36] because
[40:37] this being so poor this
[40:39] uh being this important
[40:43] brings us to the place
[40:45] of faith
[40:48] it's hard to have faith in something
[40:50] that's unstable
[40:53] if somebody's wishy-washy if they're
[40:55] here today gone tomorrow if they promise
[40:58] one thing here and
[40:59] over here and they renege here and they
[41:01] were nick here and they don't do it and
[41:02] they don't follow their word and they
[41:04] don't do
[41:05] it's hard to trust that person
[41:07] it's hard to have confidence and faith
[41:09] in somebody that doesn't uphold to their
[41:12] word
[41:13] the the
[41:15] the
[41:17] pinnacle standard
[41:19] that every one of us should have
[41:23] our word
[41:24] the value of our word
[41:27] well the value of god's word is the same
[41:30] but if if the person is not holding to
[41:34] the value of that word maybe they're a
[41:36] habitual liar
[41:38] a pathological liar
[41:40] maybe a lying comes so
[41:43] uh uh simply to some people it just
[41:45] comes out of their mouths before they
[41:47] even realize they're lying
[41:50] but it's true
[41:52] unfortunately there's a certain place
[41:54] the bible teaches us that liars go
[41:57] and i think we know what that place is
[42:02] but lies
[42:03] deception
[42:05] broken promises
[42:09] happens to us our whole lives
[42:12] it shouldn't but it does
[42:14] but the only place it doesn't happen is
[42:16] with our relationship with god
[42:18] in our relationship with jesus christ
[42:21] we can't it's hard to have confidence in
[42:24] somebody
[42:25] test tribe
[42:27] that fails
[42:30] well it's 50 50.
[42:32] oh 70 30.
[42:34] 10 90.
[42:36] i really can't trust this person
[42:39] and
[42:40] and honestly friends
[42:41] there's people i know
[42:45] they're on the 1090 scale
[42:49] i have about 10 confidence in that
[42:51] person that's pretty low
[42:55] amen i have more confidence that the
[42:56] lights are going to come on when i flip
[42:58] the switch out there
[42:59] then i do when that person tells me
[43:01] something
[43:02] amen when you've been deceived and
[43:04] you've been burnt and you've been
[43:06] stabbed in the back so many times it
[43:08] comes to the point to where you're
[43:11] your confidence your trust your faith in
[43:13] that person is gone
[43:16] but
[43:18] the contrast to that is god
[43:22] that's why even in the
[43:24] unseen we can have full confidence and
[43:28] assurance and 100
[43:30] faith that he's going to do what he said
[43:33] he would do
[43:34] now again sometimes people say well god
[43:37] didn't do this well why didn't he
[43:40] was it against
[43:42] was it because it was against what you
[43:44] wanted
[43:46] because it didn't work out the way you
[43:47] expected
[43:49] or it wasn't according to your will
[43:52] you know so many times we pray a certain
[43:54] way and god answers our prayer and we
[43:56] miss it because he doesn't do it exactly
[43:58] the way we thought he would
[44:01] missed it all together because it wasn't
[44:02] done like this
[44:04] wasn't god that failed it was me that
[44:06] failed
[44:08] it was you that failed
[44:10] because god didn't fail
[44:12] god never failed god can't fail
[44:15] it is an absolute
[44:17] bonafide impossibility
[44:20] for god to fail can't happen
[44:24] can't lie
[44:25] god can't lie
[44:27] god can't renege on a promise
[44:29] god can't
[44:31] go back on his word
[44:34] god doesn't take back what he gives you
[44:37] that's why
[44:39] so many times i hear people preach about
[44:42] because brother branham said you know if
[44:44] you do this or that and the spirit of
[44:45] god will leave you and people think
[44:47] you've lost your salvation
[44:49] you mean to tell me
[44:52] that if i go a mile an hour of the speed
[44:54] limit i've lost my salvation until i
[44:57] drop back down to the speed limit is
[44:58] that what you're telling me
[45:02] i know that sounds frivolous things but
[45:04] that's kind of the way some people
[45:05] believe it
[45:06] because brother branham said
[45:08] that dove takes his flight right that's
[45:10] what he said right
[45:12] but without an understanding of the
[45:14] revelation
[45:15] god doesn't give you the holy ghost and
[45:18] you are born again and sealed with that
[45:20] promise god doesn't take it away from
[45:22] you the next day
[45:24] god doesn't take it away from you
[45:26] because you went through a peak light
[45:28] god doesn't take it away because you
[45:30] want a half mile to speed limit
[45:33] it's an anointing that anointing it
[45:36] might leave
[45:38] but you don't lose your salvation
[45:41] if you're saved if god's filled you with
[45:43] the spirit if you've been sealed you've
[45:45] been sealed to your destination
[45:48] amen god doesn't give it to you and then
[45:50] take it away from you
[45:52] oh here's the holy spirit you're born to
[45:54] give him change your soul burn out that
[45:56] old nature and then tomorrow he's like
[45:58] oh you've been a rotten kid i'm gonna
[45:59] take that back from you
[46:01] god doesn't do that
[46:03] amen amen
[46:07] god
[46:09] when he gives it he gives it that's it
[46:11] this decision is final
[46:13] amen that's exactly what it is but our
[46:16] faith
[46:16] look here now our faith is what it's
[46:18] based on
[46:21] is based on the immutability of god
[46:25] if god were not immutable if god were
[46:28] changing flipping
[46:31] here one day gone the next how would you
[46:33] ever have confidence in something like
[46:34] that
[46:35] but god's not like that
[46:37] so the the foundation
[46:40] of the importance of hebrews 13 8
[46:44] of brethren mentioning it so many times
[46:47] especially during times of prayer lines
[46:50] where people's faith needed to be to a
[46:53] certain level to receive what they
[46:55] needed from god
[46:57] their faith had to get to that place
[47:00] over and over he's the same today
[47:03] did he do it yesterday
[47:05] then he'll do it today
[47:08] if he did it today he'll do it tomorrow
[47:11] because he's unchanging
[47:13] you can have faith in someone like that
[47:16] you can have confidence in someone just
[47:18] think about this for a minute if there
[47:20] was ever one human ever on the planet
[47:22] earth
[47:23] that ever was like that to you in the
[47:25] flesh would you have the utmost hundred
[47:28] percent confidence in that person yes
[47:31] i would
[47:32] i'd trust that person for anything
[47:35] i could tell them anything i could tell
[47:38] them the deepest darkest secrets and say
[47:40] keep it to yourself and know that that
[47:42] person wasn't going to tell somebody
[47:43] else if you don't tell somebody else
[47:46] right
[47:48] i could have confidence in that person
[47:52] i've never found anybody in my life like
[47:53] that including myself
[47:57] amen
[47:58] i've let people down all the time
[48:00] i try not to it's not my intention
[48:03] i don't say it with the purpose of of
[48:06] purposely deceiving somebody
[48:09] that's where you get into the depths of
[48:11] sin see
[48:12] you you say something for the specific
[48:15] person of deception that that that's the
[48:18] lie that the scripture's talking about
[48:20] if you say something of the whole heart
[48:22] assurance that you have every intention
[48:24] of fulfilling your word and some happens
[48:27] and you're not able to that's different
[48:30] but if you tell somebody and and you
[48:32] know in your heart you're purposely
[48:34] deceiving that person
[48:36] well that's satanic friend
[48:39] because you absolutely know that you're
[48:40] deceiving them and that that's against
[48:43] the scripture
[48:45] look at this the unchanging god brother
[48:47] branham said it wasn't so from the
[48:49] beginning that's the message
[48:52] therefore when god once does anything
[48:55] or makes a decision as i've often quoted
[48:58] that he
[48:59] he always has to stay with his decision
[49:04] just like in the garden of eden like i
[49:05] said
[49:06] his decision was it took the blood of an
[49:09] innocent one that's his decision
[49:11] he's got to stay with that decision all
[49:13] the way through
[49:15] amen and he did
[49:18] how that how that listen now this is
[49:22] tremendous as often i was going he said
[49:24] he always has to stay with his decision
[49:28] how that ought to enlighten our faith
[49:32] amen how that ought to enlighten our
[49:35] faith see when god says something
[49:39] all heavens and earth will change pass
[49:42] away but that cannot change or pass away
[49:47] therefore it should give us character it
[49:50] should give us faith amen
[49:53] is to give us faith to take that word
[49:56] which he has said
[49:58] and with all of our life hold on to it
[50:01] because he cannot change it
[50:05] with all of our heart with all of our
[50:08] being
[50:08] hold on to it
[50:10] that's why we can that's why this word
[50:13] is so important to us
[50:15] this scripture is so important to us see
[50:17] friends
[50:18] there have been holy books written by
[50:20] men
[50:23] you got different the koran mormon book
[50:26] there's all kinds of different
[50:28] books that are considered sacred to
[50:30] their religious sect
[50:32] and those people follow those books
[50:34] those things were written by fallible
[50:36] humans
[50:39] this book was written by god himself
[50:42] through the hands and intelligence of
[50:44] other people
[50:46] but god wrote it this is god in letter
[50:48] form now this isn't this isn't god it's
[50:51] a book but in letter form god
[50:54] has
[50:56] made a way to reveal himself to us
[50:59] so we can read it
[51:02] but the others
[51:05] are fallible
[51:07] because they're written their their
[51:08] author is is fallible well if the author
[51:12] is fallible then how is the word on from
[51:15] that author not fallible
[51:19] our word is infallible because it it
[51:22] came from an infallible god
[51:25] an unchanging god so you can trust it
[51:27] that's why this this bible this word is
[51:29] so important
[51:31] if people want to do away with it friend
[51:33] and preach some kind of modern day
[51:35] something no
[51:37] this word change it how many how many
[51:39] variations do they have now of the bible
[51:43] how many different interpretations and
[51:45] translations are there two or three
[51:47] thousand
[51:48] i don't even know anymore
[51:51] how many uh but there's only one
[51:54] revelation of this word that god gives
[51:56] to his children only one
[51:59] amen out of the thousands of
[52:01] translations
[52:02] there's only one revelation because it
[52:05] is god
[52:06] one
[52:08] so it doesn't
[52:09] god's going to reveal it regardless
[52:12] the problem people have is they want to
[52:14] try to understand the bible instead of
[52:16] letting god reveal it to them
[52:18] amen
[52:19] the bible isn't here for your
[52:21] understanding the bible is here for
[52:23] revelation to change your life
[52:26] to anchor your soul which will change
[52:28] your life
[52:29] that's what the bible is for that's what
[52:32] god
[52:32] gave us this word for so he could unfold
[52:35] himself just a little more and reveal
[52:37] himself to us so we can become new
[52:39] creatures
[52:41] not to gain a greater intellect not to
[52:43] have something to argue with another
[52:45] brother about how right you are and how
[52:47] wrong he is
[52:49] it was given to us so god could reveal
[52:52] himself and open himself to us
[52:54] amen
[52:56] so it's it's not a level of intellect i
[52:59] need to understand what this says not
[53:01] just pray god will reveal it to you amen
[53:04] amen absolutely
[53:06] because it's his word
[53:08] that's where we rest our faith
[53:11] i got another scripture i want to read
[53:13] hebrews chapter 6.
[53:19] hebrews chapter 6.
[53:25] now we've
[53:27] you ever heard the phrase
[53:29] which you became popular i think back in
[53:31] the 90s
[53:32] you see bumper stickers and stickers and
[53:35] and this thing all over the place i
[53:37] didn't think one time i remember at a
[53:38] billboard in charlotte north carolina
[53:40] somebody had a billboard god said it i
[53:43] believe it that settles it
[53:46] oh no
[53:49] god said it that settles it whether you
[53:52] believe it or not
[53:54] when god said it that settled it i don't
[53:57] have to believe it for him to settle it
[53:59] now i have to believe it for it to be
[54:00] settled to me right
[54:02] i have to believe it
[54:04] but when god said it that settled it
[54:07] that's the end of it
[54:08] amen it's his word
[54:10] praise whether i believe it or not
[54:14] but i do
[54:16] so then it's settled to me praise the
[54:18] lord
[54:19] it might not be settled to the person
[54:20] down the street but it's settled to me
[54:22] because i believe it right
[54:24] but it's settled either way if it's not
[54:26] settled then what is god going to use
[54:28] when he gets on the other side of the
[54:29] white throne judgment what is he going
[54:30] to use
[54:32] it's like billy graham said many times
[54:34] if god's going to judge the world how is
[54:35] he going to do it by the catholic church
[54:37] well if the catholic church which
[54:39] catholic church
[54:40] the roman church the orthodox church the
[54:42] greek church which one is he going to do
[54:44] it
[54:46] oh it'll be the baptist within which
[54:48] baptist southern baptist nor the baptist
[54:50] eastern baptist western baptist
[54:52] first baptist second baptist tenth
[54:54] baptist which one is it going to be
[54:56] methodists which methodist which
[54:58] presbyterian which lutheran which church
[55:01] which denomination or affiliation of is
[55:03] it going to be
[55:05] well it's going to be by the message
[55:06] what message
[55:08] the nine different interpretations
[55:10] brother adam told brother greene he
[55:12] would find when he come here
[55:14] which one of those nine
[55:16] oh brother branham is coming back oh
[55:17] brother madam is god well i'm not going
[55:20] to go into all of them
[55:22] which one is it going to be god's not
[55:24] going to judge the world by that
[55:26] absolutely not god's going to judge the
[55:28] world by this
[55:30] his holy word
[55:33] and this only
[55:35] that's how he's going to judge because
[55:37] he's a just god
[55:39] amen he's not going to judge you by
[55:41] catholic not going to judge you by
[55:42] method he's not going to judge about
[55:44] tucson tabernacle tabernacle word of god
[55:46] tabernacle he's judging it by the word
[55:50] amen that's why it's so important that
[55:53] you as you read that ask god for
[55:55] revelation that word to anchor your soul
[55:58] to it
[56:00] amen it's not significant that you can
[56:03] explain it
[56:04] but it is very important that you
[56:06] believe it
[56:08] absolutely imperative that you believe
[56:10] it you must believe it
[56:13] it's his word
[56:15] god said it that settled it
[56:17] and when it's settled that's what he
[56:20] uses
[56:21] that's his standard
[56:23] amen when we get on the other side when
[56:25] when the white throne judgment is set up
[56:28] the books are open that's the standard
[56:30] god's gonna judge it by
[56:32] he's got the word he is the word
[56:35] their lies the book of life
[56:38] and how is their lives gonna match up to
[56:40] that word
[56:42] that's how god's going to judge it
[56:45] thank god we'll be on the throne judging
[56:47] with him
[56:48] because we've been found guiltless
[56:50] praise the lord
[56:52] but that's how god's going to judge it's
[56:54] got to be by what he said his word
[56:57] doesn't change that's how he can judge
[57:00] justly
[57:01] because it doesn't change
[57:03] like he doesn't change hebrews 6 13. let
[57:06] me close here for when god made promise
[57:09] when god made a promise to abraham our
[57:13] father of faith
[57:15] because he could swear by no greater
[57:19] because there is no one greater
[57:21] he swore by himself god swore how about
[57:23] himself because there's no one greater
[57:25] to swear by
[57:26] he swore by himself saying
[57:28] surely blessing
[57:30] i will bless thee
[57:32] and multiplying i will multiply thee
[57:35] that was god's promise
[57:37] god gave abraham that promise
[57:41] and so after
[57:44] he abraham had patiently endured he
[57:48] obtained that promise
[57:50] he obtained it
[57:51] praise the lord as the sands of the sea
[57:54] as the stars of the sky he obtained the
[57:56] promise god gave him that son isaac that
[57:59] was his son out of his own loins would
[58:01] issue forth his heir
[58:04] and from that air would be the sands of
[58:06] the sea the stars of the sky
[58:08] innumerability
[58:10] praise the lord
[58:11] he obtained that promise he patiently
[58:14] endured had faith
[58:17] he had faith go romans 4. he had faith
[58:20] the bible says hebrews 4 god's recording
[58:23] of abraham was he did not waver
[58:27] you go read the actual story in genesis
[58:30] 15 to 20 you find out that it sure looks
[58:32] like he wavered to me
[58:35] even took hagar into his bosom and had
[58:38] another child
[58:40] looks like he wavered but when god
[58:44] come to write in the new testament of
[58:47] god's account oh i love that god's
[58:50] account of abraham was he wavered not
[58:54] praise the lord
[58:56] amen
[58:57] that that's
[58:59] my talk about a god you can have faith
[59:01] and trust in
[59:02] talk about a god of justice
[59:05] praise the lord
[59:06] amen
[59:08] god's account of abraham was he wavered
[59:10] not so his faith he patiently faith
[59:14] he obtained it because god promised it
[59:17] and god is good as his word
[59:19] amen
[59:21] let's continue on now for men verily
[59:23] swear by the greater which of course
[59:27] there's always a greater than us
[59:29] that is god
[59:31] sweared by the greater and an oath
[59:34] for confirmation
[59:36] is to them an end of strife
[59:39] well that's like abraham said well god i
[59:42] know you promised me but i'm getting old
[59:45] is it that you can show me what is it
[59:48] that you can give me to to prove that
[59:51] this is going to happen and god gave him
[59:53] an oath
[59:54] he gave him a promise
[59:56] and then he gave him an oath
[59:58] amen he gave him
[1:00:01] a seal
[1:00:03] a seal that would help him understand
[1:00:06] because of this
[1:00:08] i have upheld my end
[1:00:11] i will do what i said so when people
[1:00:15] give you a promise well one thing is a
[1:00:17] promise
[1:00:19] it is sort of like
[1:00:21] a down payment
[1:00:25] to
[1:00:26] when i was a realtor we had what was
[1:00:29] called earnest month if you went to buy
[1:00:31] a house
[1:00:32] the people required earnest money
[1:00:35] a down payment
[1:00:37] well we need five thousand dollars
[1:00:42] as
[1:00:43] as sort of a guarantee
[1:00:46] that you're going to buy this house
[1:00:49] because we're going to keep this house
[1:00:52] from being sold to the rest of the world
[1:00:55] and it's going to be our promise to you
[1:00:58] is we're going to sell you the house and
[1:01:01] nobody else
[1:01:03] even if somebody now this is the way
[1:01:04] it's supposed to work it doesn't always
[1:01:06] happen this way because of greedy
[1:01:08] serpents
[1:01:09] but it's supposed to work
[1:01:11] where that house becomes unavailable to
[1:01:14] anybody else even if somebody came along
[1:01:16] and offered five million dollars more in
[1:01:18] money
[1:01:19] they cannot buy it because you promised
[1:01:22] that person you're selling it to them
[1:01:24] for 20 cents
[1:01:26] you can sell it to them for 10 million
[1:01:28] but you've already well it can't be 20
[1:01:29] cent because you got 5 000 earnest money
[1:01:31] 10 000 how's that house for 10 000
[1:01:35] so you got to have 5 000 earnest money
[1:01:37] you gotta have a down payment so work my
[1:01:40] my promises to you
[1:01:42] is and i hope you get the spiritual
[1:01:44] application here now
[1:01:46] my promise to you is i will not sell
[1:01:48] this house to anybody else
[1:01:51] no matter if somebody comes off me ten
[1:01:53] million dollars for it i won't sell it
[1:01:54] to them
[1:01:55] now that's the way it's supposed to work
[1:01:57] you know it was like illegal stuff that
[1:01:58] happens and
[1:02:00] anyway but
[1:02:02] my promises i won't sell to anybody else
[1:02:04] your promise to me is you're going to
[1:02:06] give me five thousand dollars
[1:02:10] as an oath
[1:02:11] as a down payment
[1:02:13] that you're gonna do what you're telling
[1:02:15] me you're gonna do
[1:02:16] see
[1:02:17] so that person's giving them the money
[1:02:20] he's saying okay now you're not going to
[1:02:21] sell it to anybody else nope not going
[1:02:23] to sell them to anybody else here's the
[1:02:25] five thousand dollars in i'll give it to
[1:02:27] you you hold it for us and we promise
[1:02:29] we're going to buy the house
[1:02:31] that's the promise of course you got
[1:02:33] inspections and all that mess but just
[1:02:34] say the house is perfect
[1:02:37] that down payment is an oath
[1:02:41] now the promise is there and it's
[1:02:43] recorded it's been written in paper
[1:02:45] signed by both parties
[1:02:47] but the oath is the down payment
[1:02:50] the down payment says this is what i'm
[1:02:53] giving you to show you that i'm good to
[1:02:56] my word
[1:02:57] now if that person backs out of the deal
[1:02:59] and decides not to buy it with no legal
[1:03:02] recourse
[1:03:03] then the person that was selling it to
[1:03:05] them could keep the five thousand
[1:03:07] dollars for doing nothing
[1:03:09] they keep the money because they reneged
[1:03:11] on the promise on the oath
[1:03:14] because they didn't follow through with
[1:03:16] their oath that they were going to buy
[1:03:18] the house
[1:03:19] now again the house is perfect nothing
[1:03:21] wrong with it so there's no good reason
[1:03:23] for them to back out
[1:03:25] i know somebody
[1:03:26] he's a millionaire so it doesn't really
[1:03:28] matter but
[1:03:29] he put 20 000 earnest money on a house
[1:03:33] and backed out of the purchase
[1:03:35] the person that he promised he was going
[1:03:37] to buy the house from kept the 20 000
[1:03:40] legally he had the right to do that and
[1:03:43] he did because the person who backed out
[1:03:45] had no reason to back out
[1:03:48] the person who was selling in the house
[1:03:50] did everything they said they were going
[1:03:51] to do they kept the 20 000
[1:03:55] see that's the oath
[1:03:56] that's the down payment
[1:03:59] that the promise has been made it's been
[1:04:01] written
[1:04:02] but there was an oath there
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:05] that oath says that this is the down
[1:04:08] payment
[1:04:10] you know god gives us that oath too
[1:04:13] just like he did abraham
[1:04:15] god gave abraham that oath see that oath
[1:04:19] is for confirmation
[1:04:21] praise the lord god gave abraham that
[1:04:24] oath well he gives us an oath too
[1:04:28] because we stand and say we believe
[1:04:31] and if we really truly believe and god
[1:04:34] accepts our faith he seals us with his
[1:04:37] own spirit
[1:04:39] he gives us the earnest the down payment
[1:04:43] the holy spirit that says i promise that
[1:04:46] you belong to me
[1:04:48] and my promise to you is god that i will
[1:04:50] serve you and live for you my entire

[1:07:39] have fled for refuge to lay hold
[1:07:42] upon the hope set before us

[1:09:13] an oath i have a promise i have a spirit
[1:09:16] i know his word i know it's true i

[1:09:22] other day oh yeah i remember it
[1:09:25] i have a memory in my spirit yeah i
[1:09:26] remember exactly what i did
[1:09:28] you're the one that calls it and i've
[1:09:30] repented of that now it's back on you
[1:09:32] satan now you're the one that has to
[1:09:34] live with it until the day of judgment
[1:09:37] and at the day of judgment you're going
[1:09:38] to be held guilty for it not me
[1:09:42] praise the lord i've been justified
[1:09:45] as if though i never did well then
[1:09:46] where'd it come from the devil that's
[1:09:49] exactly what we're going to do
[1:09:51] remind him
[1:09:52] he wants to try to remind you of past
[1:09:54] remind him of his future
[1:09:56] amen where he's headed
[1:09:58] but he'll do it he'll challenge he'll
[1:10:00] try to destroy every bit of faith you've
[1:10:02] got with it
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:05] praise the lord jesus
[1:10:07] let me read this he swore by himself i'm
[1:10:09] close here
[1:10:10] you know i'm a i'm not a sign seeker
[1:10:13] and i'm reading that even though that
[1:10:15] would be something i would say too
[1:10:17] but i believe in science that's right if
[1:10:20] there is no invisible sign given to man
[1:10:23] today why no wonder people can't believe
[1:10:26] listen this real close now because it's
[1:10:27] exactly i think it probably was
[1:10:29] happening in 1954 when he preached this
[1:10:32] but
[1:10:33] boy howdy doesn't it happen today
[1:10:36] this is exactly
[1:10:39] no wonder people can't believe
[1:10:43] they go around and people just took all
[1:10:45] the supernatural out of the bible yes
[1:10:48] a man come up said i'm saved
[1:10:51] well you can't doubt him you can't say
[1:10:53] he's not that's right he says the man
[1:10:56] come up the street just as drunk as he
[1:10:58] can be cigar hanging out his mouth
[1:11:00] staggering hollering whooping cussing
[1:11:02] every breath
[1:11:03] he would say i'm saved because i believe
[1:11:06] he said what are you going to say about
[1:11:07] it
[1:11:08] what are you going to do about it there
[1:11:09] ain't nothing you can do about it he
[1:11:11] says my church takes me in i'm a member
[1:11:14] what are you going to do about it
[1:11:15] there's nothing you can do
[1:11:17] that's exactly right
[1:11:19] i'm a member of the so-and-so church
[1:11:21] they don't care if i've gotten drunk
[1:11:24] they don't care if i smoke they don't
[1:11:25] care if i drink they don't care if i
[1:11:27] crowds around they don't care if i
[1:11:28] gamble they don't care if i got tattoo
[1:11:30] head to heal
[1:11:31] i don't care
[1:11:33] i'm a member of the church
[1:11:35] i'm a believer
[1:11:37] i know what you're going to tell them
[1:11:39] no you're not a believer
[1:11:41] well you can say well the signs shall
[1:11:43] follow them that believe right signs

[1:11:53] only way you can tell is by the sign
[1:11:57] what's the sign the sign is the oath
[1:11:59] what's the opioid that's the holy ghost
[1:12:01] the promise the earnest
[1:12:03] or the
[1:12:04] the earnest the down payment is that
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:07] that's exactly right you have to see the
[1:12:09] sign to show it now if it's just of
[1:12:12] faith alone then faith don't do it
[1:12:16] abraham believed god that's right it was
[1:12:18] imputed to him for righteousness but god

[1:16:06] circumstances if god promised you

[1:18:51] droves
[1:18:53] in one way shape or form
[1:18:55] but my i don't i can't imagine any other
[1:18:58] life that i would live
[1:19:00] in being a bible-believing holy
[1:19:03] ghost-filled christian
[1:19:05] it's just nothing like
[1:19:06] it amen
[1:19:09] no other type host
[1:19:12] muhammad's made all kind of promises
[1:19:14] buddha and confucius and whatever and
[1:19:16] all these great sayings that
[1:19:18] will
[1:19:18] lift you intellectually
[1:19:21] i'm not
[1:19:22] you know friend
[1:19:24] we come to meet death's door i could
[1:19:26] care less about my intellect
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:31] you think i don't now but i do a little
[1:19:33] bit but it's the soul
[1:19:37] it's the soul
[1:19:38] i need to anchor my soul
[1:19:41] praise the lord
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] god bless you
[1:19:45] i prayed something and said blessed
[1:19:47] you today now i want to mention a couple
[1:19:49] things to you remember i do want to have
[1:19:52] and i want to get a
[1:19:53] um
[1:19:55] an idea from you all because i had
[1:19:57] somebody mentioned this to me yesterday
[1:20:00] i mentioned trying to
[1:20:02] having wanting to to have communion and
[1:20:05] foot washing on easter
[1:20:07] it's brought to my attention that people
[1:20:09] have families and they go to dinners
[1:20:11] with those families which i understand
[1:20:12] which last time we had come we had our
[1:20:15] service went out had a bite to eat and
[1:20:18] then came back for communion and foot
[1:20:20] washing
[1:20:21] i wasn't planning to do that this time i
[1:20:24] was planning to
[1:20:26] have a short easter message if you will
[1:20:29] and i say sure y'all probably look at me
[1:20:31] and doubt that don't you
[1:20:33] sure yeah
[1:20:35] but i can tell you that's my intention
[1:20:39] uh and then and then after that have
[1:20:41] communion and footwash directly after
[1:20:44] so then you would have the day the
[1:20:46] afternoon whatever uh to go spend with
[1:20:49] family it it it that's okay
[1:20:53] everybody okay if not we can always we
[1:20:56] could always move it
[1:20:57] the weekend before the week and after it
[1:21:00] just came on my heart to do it on easter
[1:21:02] so
[1:21:02] uh i but i i didn't want that to
[1:21:05] interrupt
[1:21:06] anyone that had specific special things
[1:21:09] going on but if that would be okay we'll
[1:21:12] probably i try to
[1:21:13] see lord willing now i don't want to be
[1:21:16] in control of this so understand that
[1:21:18] i'll he i want him to be in control of
[1:21:21] it
[1:21:22] he's not in control of our services and
[1:21:24] the singing preaching everything
[1:21:26] i just soon stay home i just go to lunch
[1:21:28] now
[1:21:31] but i want him in control of it so
[1:21:33] understand that
[1:21:34] my intention is not to take any much
[1:21:37] more time than what we have like in
[1:21:39] today's service
[1:21:41] if he takes over
[1:21:42] uh that's that's not on us
[1:21:46] that's up to him whatever he decides to
[1:21:48] do but that's my intention so under
[1:21:50] those
[1:21:51] parameters is everybody still okay with
[1:21:54] having the communion foot watching on
[1:21:56] easter sunday yes
[1:21:58] okay good i haven't
[1:22:01] if not speak up is i mean we're all a
[1:22:04] family so if it's any issue let me know
[1:22:07] okay
[1:22:08] praise the lord the other thing is
[1:22:11] uh
[1:22:13] i want to have a
[1:22:15] brother's breakfast on april 2nd
[1:22:18] saturday morning
[1:22:20] april 2nd i i
[1:22:22] i haven't really
[1:22:25] figured where to have it again yet maybe
[1:22:27] i guess the denny's probably it's kind
[1:22:29] of convenient
[1:22:31] for
[1:22:32] brother dennis comes such a long ways
[1:22:34] and
[1:22:35] uh from the east so

[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:43] they have better biscuits they have
[1:22:45] gravy they have fritz they have country
[1:22:46] ham i don't have any of that at denny's
[1:22:49] but i know brother dennis uh and and
[1:22:51] even uh
[1:22:53] danny have to drive a good distance that

[1:23:35] please remember that if you could as
[1:23:37] well pray for us and remember these
[1:23:39] prayer requests
[1:23:40] uh the things going on in the world
[1:23:42] today saints
[1:23:43] uh you know i hear so many times people
[1:23:46] talk about preaching on all the current
[1:23:48] events and the russian the ukraine and
[1:23:51] all the quotes and things and
[1:23:53] you know i would i guess i would too if
[1:23:54] the lord put that on my heart but he
[1:23:56] doesn't he hasn't any more than what
[1:23:58] i've already said so
[1:24:00] we know where we're living
[1:24:02] we know the day
[1:24:04] we know the season we're living
[1:24:06] uh
[1:24:07] i don't need to tell you what's going on
[1:24:10] you can see what's going on
[1:24:12] uh it's a travesty
[1:24:13] it's
[1:24:14] it's it's just it's horrible
[1:24:18] that these
[1:24:19] innocent people are being killed i
[1:24:23] actually had a little thought on my mind
[1:24:24] but
[1:24:26] the lord stood a different way you know
[1:24:27] the bible says
[1:24:29] the bible says if you see a brother in
[1:24:31] needs
[1:24:32] and you can help that brother and you
[1:24:34] shut up your bowels of compassion how
[1:24:36] dwelleth the love of god in you
[1:24:38] and i think about that and what we as a
[1:24:40] nation could do
[1:24:42] and a world could do
[1:24:44] to keep these women and babies from
[1:24:46] being slaughtered like that
[1:24:48] shot down just waiting to get some
[1:24:50] breads
[1:24:52] and i think
[1:24:54] anyway
[1:24:56] but god's in control
[1:24:59] he puts him up he sets him down so
[1:25:02] whatever purpose whatever reason we know
[1:25:04] we're at the end so
[1:25:05] amen we just cling to him that much more
[1:25:08] hold to that unchanging hand
[1:25:10] praise the lord
[1:25:12] amen
[1:25:13] it would have been a good song to sing
[1:25:15] god bless you love you appreciate you
[1:25:18] anyone have anything before dismiss
[1:25:20] today
[1:25:20] anything else in your heart
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:40] praise the lord
[1:25:41] can you make it up here you want me to
[1:25:43] come back there
[1:25:45] somebody else want to be pretty cool
[1:25:47] i'm sorry did somebody else want to be
