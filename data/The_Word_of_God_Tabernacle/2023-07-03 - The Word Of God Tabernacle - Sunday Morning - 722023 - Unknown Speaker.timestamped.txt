[26:38] my knee did good up and down the ladder
[26:41] a couple two three hundred times uh
[26:44] doing the stuff I needed to do for the
[26:45] job so thanks for the Lord blessed is
[26:48] still not quite a hundred percent
[26:51] um but the Lord's really blessed and I
[26:53] appreciate him that for it the
[26:55] temperature
[26:56] um
[26:57] it was hot
[26:59] it was hot and humid that heat index uh
[27:03] one at one afternoon that he didn't
[27:04] index made it to 113. but every day it
[27:09] was at least 105 heat index
[27:12] uh now hovered around 100 degrees but
[27:15] real feel was 105 plus every day
[27:19] so it was kind of warm but I I sweated
[27:24] quite a bit but thank the Lord I just I
[27:27] forced myself and made myself
[27:29] drink and drink and drink so the Lord
[27:32] helped us there so I appreciate that
[27:34] took a little bit of salt too so which
[27:37] helped but
[27:38] um I appreciate your prayers and the
[27:41] flights were really good the Lord
[27:42] blessed it so I appreciate that amen uh
[27:46] also I was remembering yesterday you
[27:50] know yesterday with was brother Green's
[27:52] birthday would have been you would have
[27:54] been 90 years old when I started
[27:56] thinking about it brother green would
[27:57] have been 90 years old yesterday uh so I
[28:00] I personally I still miss it
[28:03] he wasn't a perfect man by any means but
[28:05] uh he meant a lot to me Lord sent me
[28:08] here to help him and uh I did the best I
[28:11] could at that and
[28:13] and again I I still I guess the Lord
[28:16] just created an affinity there uh you
[28:19] know when you when you kind of have that
[28:21] bond with somebody and they have little
[28:24] mess-ups or something or treat you a
[28:27] little different way or something you
[28:29] can't help but still have such a great
[28:31] love and affinity for that person amen
[28:34] just that's just the way it is a lot of
[28:36] people leave and run and how goody and
[28:39] blah blah blah and but you know the only
[28:42] thing I can figure is God just didn't
[28:43] place that that love there and when I
[28:47] came here and the Lord showed me he
[28:49] placed that love there and he never left
[28:51] regardless of anything
[28:53] so um so upon that I do still miss him
[28:57] uh but uh I was remembering that
[29:00] yesterday so
[29:02] just remember these requests anyone to
[29:04] have an unspoken requested
[29:06] Lord knows all of our hearts let's stand
[29:08] to our feet if we could
[29:09] amen
[29:11] and on the Lord is mindful of every need
[29:13] yes our faults speak louder Before the
[29:16] Throne of God than through our words yes
[29:19] amen praise the Lord if I can quote
[29:21] brother green brother Dennis would you

[29:31] gratitude and love in our hearts for you
[29:34] knowing father you're caring yes and
[29:37] mindful and loving God here
[29:40] one is to ask that our Joys may be full
[29:43] and father it's we heard a theme with
[29:46] our the songs that we worship in your
[29:50] name this morning yes it is such an
[29:53] utmost importance for all of us to know
[29:56] that we've been born again oh yes Lord
[29:59] tonight all things have passed away
[30:03] behold all things have become new and
[30:06] father if there's still that old nature
[30:08] Lord speak to our hearts all of us
[30:12] include myself lick that old nature be
[30:16] truly did yes Father it's like the
[30:18] prophet said that you'll know where you
[30:21] stand with God when you're put to the
[30:23] test oh Jesus and God will always obsess
[30:26] these people you'll know what you're
[30:28] made out of when you're put to the test
[30:31] you put under pressure where would you
[30:34] stand if you find yourself standing away
[30:37] from God and doubting God and and then
[30:40] and going against God you have to be
[30:45] honest within yourself you need to have
[30:49] a born-again experience you need that
[30:51] closer walk father Yes you said in the
[30:55] last days to redeem the time for the

[31:14] through us for we're more than
[31:16] conquerors for them they are in Christ
[31:19] Jesus thank you Lord the Lord help us to
[31:21] recognize that for if we had so much
[31:25] think that we can help you along the way
[31:28] that oh Lord I'll do it no more I don't

[31:35] miles shortly what it takes to be a real

[40:18] about it came up we got here a lot of
[40:21] other friends
[40:25] yes
[40:27] praise the Lord amen wonderful
[40:32] there are liver doctors now
[40:34] [Music]
[40:37] that's amazing
[40:39] it's so specialized
[40:42] um I there is a pastor of an Assemblies
[40:46] of God in church his name is Dan
[40:48] coverstone
[40:50] and he and his dreams come to pass
[40:54] started dreaming around 2019.
[40:57] and
[40:59] one of the dreams I'm concerned about
[41:02] is
[41:04] for
[41:06] real real close now I've hesitated on
[41:09] saying this
[41:12] um that so I want to ask you to pray
[41:15] about it but I he dreamed that people
[41:20] were going to something like a Fourth of
[41:22] July celebration and people were just
[41:24] cram packed and everybody was looking up
[41:27] and everything was going off and they
[41:30] were waiting for the fireworks but it
[41:32] didn't happen instead it started raining
[41:35] down bits of rags and burning stuff and
[41:38] cars were on fire and people were trying
[41:40] to get out of there they were up on a
[41:42] bluff over looking at and even they had
[41:45] trouble getting out so
[41:47] um they went home and and he had another
[41:50] dream in which there were holes in the
[41:53] ground across the border and people were
[41:55] storming out of the holes
[41:57] [Music]
[41:58] and
[41:59] and he's not the only one that streamed
[42:02] this Invasion anyway I just want you to
[42:05] pray about it about for the Fourth of
[42:07] July about the wisdom of gathering with
[42:10] people and and this kind of a thing you
[42:14] know they kept purging look up look up
[42:17] it was a diversion
[42:20] so they could do what they wanted to do
[42:21] on the ground so it's just a just a
[42:25] heads up that you pray please pray about
[42:30] your gathering this year and it sounds
[42:33] like tribulation to me so forth yeah
[42:35] we're not gonna be here for that but
[42:37] we're not good
[42:39] [Music]
[42:42] Wars and things like the Lord comes and
[42:45] so it's just a heads up yes praise the
[42:48] Lord
[42:49] amen thankful God keeps us amen let's
[42:53] stand to our feet if we could even see
[42:56] anybody else
[42:57] because you had some
[42:59] not little we'll just stand uh let's go
[43:01] to the scripture again now Genesis
[43:03] chapter 3
[43:05] we're going to read uh just the one
[43:06] scripture that we've been reading when
[43:08] we begin these uh this on the holy
[43:11] spirit this part five uh we're going to
[43:14] get a little more in depth with the
[43:15] false anointed today and
[43:18] uh go to that the Lord willing so
[43:21] Genesis chapter 3 we're going to read
[43:23] one verse of scripture again the 21st
[43:26] verse but before we do let's just fire
[43:28] our heads for another word of prayer for
[43:29] you good Lord Jesus
[43:32] father we're so very thankful of your
[43:33] grace your mercy your love we thank you
[43:36] Lord as sister Matisse said and we see
[43:38] these things unfolding and Lord there's

[43:42] Lord blood to the horse's bridle and
[43:44] Lord there's been visions and prophecies
[43:46] and things even we know brother Branham
[43:48] gave and other things that's going to
[43:50] happen Lord but God wants this
[43:52] tribulation really strikes us through
[43:54] our father Lord we see the things going
[43:57] on now God how they are getting so
[43:59] ungodly but Lord we thank you God that
[44:02] you've given us the Holy Spirit father
[44:04] you've given us an inoculation you've

[44:28] you Lord for this time Lord that we have
[44:30] here to come in from out of the world
[44:31] this place you give us Lord we pray that
[44:34] you'd speak to these lips that you would
[44:36] hear through our ears and that whatever
[44:38] your purpose is for this service today
[44:40] be accomplished God lord may you just
[44:43] have your weight and Lord do everything
[44:45] that would be according to your perfect
[44:47] will for this time of this place today

[44:51] just bless and strengthen them those who
[44:53] may be watching Lord the streaming God
[44:56] may your hand be upon them as well we
[44:59] rebuke every demonic spirit that we try
[45:01] to hurt hinder and filtrate this service
[45:03] in any way that you get the glory honor
[45:05] and praise for all that is said and done
[45:07] we thank you Lord for the testimonies
[45:10] and for your goodness and your grace in
[45:12] our lives Lord that we could continue to
[45:14] reminisce and testify of all the good
[45:16] things that you do for us all the time
[45:18] Lord but Lord we didn't come here for
[45:21] the fellowship we came here to hear from
[45:23] you and Lord that's our whole purpose of
[45:26] being here that's our whole purpose of
[45:28] assembling together here is to hear from
[45:30] you Lord and for your word to go forth
[45:33] empowering manifestations and to do it
[45:36] and accomplish that that you sent it
[45:37] forth for we ask these things Lord in
[45:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[45:41] pray amen
[45:44] in Genesis 3 21 unto Adam also to his
[45:48] wife did the Lord God make coats with
[45:50] skins and clothed them amen you could be
[45:53] seated
[45:54] if you like now this
[45:56] um this service we're going to turn over
[45:57] and begin in Acts we've read it a couple
[46:00] of times here one a little more
[46:02] thoroughly than the other but this is
[46:04] where we want to base our service for
[46:06] today off of maybe probably next Sunday
[46:10] as well Acts chapter 2.
[46:14] going to read the first few verses amen
[46:16] and Kickstart bring forth our service
[46:19] from sort of try to where we left it off
[46:22] last week amen into this period of time
[46:25] like I said uh the last couple of times
[46:28] especially last week sort of venturing
[46:30] into it a little bit of the voice the
[46:32] false anointed
[46:34] um but uh trying to save back uh
[46:39] the real getting in the meat of it for
[46:42] this service or this and the next
[46:44] service we'll see what the Lord does so
[46:46] Acts chapter 2 now we want to begin with
[46:49] verse 1.
[46:51] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[46:53] come they were all with one Accord in
[46:55] one place and suddenly there came a
[46:58] sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty
[46:59] Wind and it filled all the house where
[47:01] they were sitting
[47:03] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[47:05] like as a fire and it sat upon each of
[47:09] them and they were all filled with the
[47:12] Holy Ghost began to speak with other
[47:14] tongues as the spirit gave them
[47:16] utterance amen now again in taking the
[47:20] uh the importance of this message today
[47:23] from these two scriptures here from that
[47:25] little bit of Passage there uh that it
[47:29] that the holy spirit that broke itself
[47:31] up and sat upon each of them and
[47:35] remember and as a conjunction that joins
[47:38] the two things together it put sat upon
[47:41] them and went into them so it's an event
[47:44] that breaks two things together so it's
[47:47] two events it's one event of two things
[47:50] that's happening and the conjunction
[47:52] brings the two together so that sat upon
[47:55] them and if they were filled so it went
[47:59] on them and in them again as we have re
[48:03] iterated before the on part let's look
[48:06] at this because a lot of times we use
[48:08] different types of verbiage uh for for
[48:11] certain things and just in passing or
[48:14] just uh as we have been taught or
[48:17] learned over the years and we we call
[48:19] something a certain thing for a certain
[48:21] reason uh but I want us to examine this
[48:25] for a few moments so not necessarily
[48:27] trying to change people's verbiage I
[48:30] hear people talk about and brother
[48:31] random talk about being baptized with
[48:34] the Holy Ghost and I understand that the
[48:37] context of that is that that person is
[48:40] born again
[48:41] amen but sometimes people take that in
[48:44] it to mean something different than what
[48:47] it really is and that's kind of what we
[48:49] want to break down today because we want
[48:51] to really get into the meat of what it
[48:54] really means scripturally uh to be
[48:56] baptized and to be born again amen
[49:00] because they are they're synonymous but
[49:02] they're not the same one leads to the
[49:05] other so when we talk about when I hear
[49:08] people talk about I have the baptism of
[49:10] the Holy Ghost I understand what they
[49:12] mean what they mean is I'm born again I
[49:15] have the spirit of God living in me so
[49:17] I'm not trying to change anybody's
[49:18] verbiage necessarily but I do want us to
[49:21] understand what we're talking about when
[49:23] we say certain things or when we hear
[49:25] other people say certain things so uh so
[49:30] in looking at these definitions if you
[49:32] will and you can go back and look at the
[49:34] Greek if you want to uh and and find it
[49:37] for yourself but the word on when it
[49:40] says is here now and it sat upon or on
[49:44] on each of them on could be categorized
[49:48] as as uh synonymous with immerse amen
[49:53] something that's immersed means that
[49:55] it's on it uh if I take this bottle and
[49:59] I immerse it in water the entire outside
[50:02] of this bottle will be covered with
[50:04] whatever liquid I put it in amen it's
[50:07] not going to affect anything inside the
[50:09] bottle it's only going to affect what's
[50:11] on the outside of the bottle it's
[50:13] immersed so on means that it's immersed
[50:16] in something baptized
[50:18] baptized that's why we baptize people by
[50:22] completely immersing them we don't
[50:25] consider baptism a sprinkling or a
[50:28] pouring or something of that effect like
[50:30] other denominations or other churches do
[50:32] they believe that baptism is just simply
[50:35] sprinkling water on somebody like a baby
[50:38] or something or pouring or something
[50:40] that effect that's why we've baptize
[50:43] because baptism means a full immersion
[50:46] when a person goes in the water they are
[50:49] come there to be by representation of
[50:52] the Holy Spirit here on the day of
[50:54] Pentecost they are to be fully immersed
[50:57] in that water from head to toe amen
[51:00] that's why a lot of times I I had
[51:03] baptized people by myself when I do I
[51:06] like to get a person pretty deep in the
[51:07] water
[51:08] because I want them to be immersed
[51:12] because typically I like having somebody
[51:15] else with me because uh usually when a
[51:18] person it goes backwards their legs tend
[51:22] to flail uh so I'll I like to try to
[51:26] make sure that person head to toe is
[51:28] immersed in the water so if the foot
[51:30] comes out uh uh that's a little
[51:33] different story but if you have two
[51:35] people that person tends not to have
[51:38] their feet come up like that because
[51:39] they're they feel more comfortable I
[51:41] guess so my point is the immersion the
[51:44] baptism to baptize to fully immerse uh
[51:49] just like here the on had nothing to do
[51:52] with the inside
[51:54] just like baptism the baptism does not
[51:57] save you about being baptized does not
[52:00] mean you're born again amen there's uh
[52:03] there's a lot of people that's been
[52:05] baptized even in the name of the Lord
[52:07] Jesus Christ that are outliving horrible
[52:09] ungodly evil lives today you can't look
[52:12] at their life and say that person's Born
[52:15] Again amen you just can't so baptism we
[52:18] know is just an ordinance one of the
[52:20] three left to us uh but it represents
[52:23] something it represents first your
[52:27] confession that you're showing to the
[52:29] world that you're willing to be baptized
[52:31] because you've received Jesus as your
[52:33] savior amen but it also represents here
[52:37] in the scripture in the day of Pentecost
[52:39] when they were fully baptized or fully
[52:42] immersed in the spirit When the Spirit
[52:45] came and It Came Upon them it immersed
[52:49] them or baptized them in the spirit amen
[52:53] now it but it's it's only an outside
[52:56] appearance it's only an outside work
[52:59] that is done
[53:01] to smear or to anoint we can look in the
[53:04] Old Testament which most of the anoints
[53:07] used in the New Testament to smear
[53:08] mostly in the Old Testament where
[53:10] something is put on something or uh to
[53:13] anoint something is to just like Aaron
[53:15] was anointed with the oil it came and
[53:19] ran down his body to the Hem of His
[53:21] Garment amen which is a representation
[53:23] obviously a representation of the Holy
[53:26] Spirit but it had nothing to do with the
[53:28] work of the inside man it was only the
[53:30] outside now in you look you get to the
[53:33] next part it went on them upon them
[53:36] and they were all filled with the Holy
[53:39] with the Holy Ghost now
[53:41] if I took this bottle and I took the lid
[53:44] off and I poured water in it that's
[53:47] going to affect the inside amen that's
[53:50] going to affect what's going inside the
[53:52] bottle now it's not necessarily going to
[53:55] affect what's ins outside it it's only
[53:58] going to affect what's inside it amen
[54:01] but
[54:02] but when let's see if I could help
[54:05] explain this right if you take
[54:08] the day of Pentecost they were all the
[54:12] the Spirit came and baptized them It
[54:15] Came Upon them and they were all filled
[54:18] now if I took this bottle and I took the
[54:21] lid off amen which would represent death
[54:24] and to yourself and you take that lid
[54:27] off and you baptize it in water what
[54:31] happens to it it completely immerses the
[54:34] outside and it also fills the inside
[54:37] amen so the entire the entirety of the
[54:41] being of this bottle would be affected
[54:43] inside and out
[54:45] and the Holy Spirit does just that the
[54:48] baptism simply makes a way for the
[54:53] person of Jesus Christ to come and live
[54:56] in you when that Spirit came and it
[54:59] broke itself upon them and that Spirit
[55:01] came and immersed him God baptized them
[55:04] in that Spirit it made a way it brought
[55:08] about a a position of of the spirit of
[55:12] God to be able to come in them amen so
[55:15] that they would be filled with the
[55:17] spirit not just baptized in the spirit
[55:21] but filled with the spirit that's why uh
[55:26] I'm saying I'm not trying to change
[55:28] anybody's verbiage but I will tell you I
[55:30] have changed mine
[55:32] since the Lord has revealed to this to
[55:34] me many years ago uh and this and the
[55:38] context of the scripture now uh I I I'm
[55:42] gonna read more quotes than I normally
[55:43] read I you know me I I don't normally
[55:46] read a lot of quotes one here one there
[55:48] maybe none at all uh I don't feel like
[55:51] if you trust me as your pastor and you
[55:54] have the Holy Ghost that when this truth
[55:56] is spoken you don't need to say that
[55:58] brother Branham said
[56:00] and but but sometimes when you get in
[56:03] something that could be construed as as
[56:06] controversial as as this may be to some
[56:10] people that it's first of all derived
[56:13] from the scripture
[56:15] first of all first and foremost what I
[56:18] am bringing is by the Bible
[56:22] that's the number one thing but it's
[56:24] also backed up by what brother Branham
[56:26] said about it because brother Branham
[56:29] had to say it because the Bible says it
[56:31] yeah
[56:32] yeah that's why brother random said it
[56:35] so if I could if you pardon me a little
[56:38] bit today again a few more quotes than I
[56:41] normally quote to back up and see this
[56:44] is what the scripture says and brother
[56:46] Branham says this but he's saying this
[56:49] because this is what the Bible said he's
[56:51] only saying what the Bible says about it
[56:53] yes amen so that's why we get to what
[56:56] the Bible says now on the end we got the
[56:59] on immersed baptized Spirit going in is
[57:02] an indwelling inside or field
[57:07] to be filled again if this bottle was in
[57:09] the was dumped in the water or or even
[57:12] if you just filled it it would be filled
[57:15] that would affect the inside amen again
[57:19] if it was just poured in there it would
[57:22] affect the inside maybe not even the
[57:24] outside you think but the outside has to
[57:27] be affected before the inside can take
[57:29] place right amen so I hope that makes
[57:32] sense you understand that Phil
[57:35] um an indwelling presence or filled with
[57:38] something or this is my this is my
[57:41] favorite to be one am I Amen to be one
[57:45] praise the Lord now if you took this
[57:49] bottle and you filled it completely full
[57:52] of water and you sealed it shut
[57:55] and that bottle was never to ever be
[57:58] tampered with the lid never be taken off
[58:01] until it gets to its destination
[58:03] whatever purpose that might serve it
[58:06] will stay filled
[58:08] amen it'll never be one drop Less in
[58:13] this bottle until it reaches its
[58:16] destination and that's what Ephesians
[58:19] Paul says in Ephesians you are sealed by
[58:23] the Holy Spirit until your destination
[58:26] right amen it fulfills its purpose until
[58:30] it gets to the place it's going to
[58:33] amen now this bottle wouldn't fulfill
[58:36] its purpose until it got to the place it
[58:38] was going to but that's just a carnal
[58:40] expression of a spiritual application so
[58:43] just maybe that helps understand but
[58:46] when the water comes in when the spirit
[58:49] comes in him and you become one
[58:53] the spirit that comes in you and you
[58:56] yourself become one because the spirit
[58:59] of God sealed in your soul
[59:02] should go ahead and bring that back over
[59:03] here again
[59:05] that Holy Spirit sealed in your soul
[59:07] makes you one with him
[59:10] that's why it's called or means a new
[59:14] birth yeah amen it's not just
[59:16] necessarily a birth the birth itself is
[59:19] kind of a controversial term even
[59:21] Nicodemus is because he didn't have a
[59:23] spiritual Revelation came to Jesus Jesus
[59:25] said can I enter my mother's womb the
[59:27] second time good amen so the birth part
[59:30] could be controversial what it means is
[59:32] that God has come and living in you and
[59:35] made you a new creature because you and
[59:37] him have now become one
[59:39] you're one person so to be filled with
[59:42] that spirit makes you and God one the
[59:45] indwelling presence of God the Holy
[59:48] Spirit Jesus Christ the person of Christ
[59:50] coming and living in you makes you and
[59:53] him one
[59:55] amen
[59:56] now that that that double effect of the
[1:00:00] Holy Spirit the anointing and the
[1:00:03] indwelling presence is what makes the
[1:00:06] Fulfillment and the completion of a
[1:00:09] born-again Christian
[1:00:11] otherwise you just have somebody that's
[1:00:14] uh living by emotion or living by an
[1:00:17] anointing or going on a Feeling or
[1:00:20] propagating a gift of some kind but we
[1:00:23] know gifts and calling to our repentance
[1:00:25] right amen so
[1:00:27] without that it's it's just people
[1:00:31] making noise going to church doing it
[1:00:34] and and those things are fine I would
[1:00:35] begrudge anybody trying to live the life
[1:00:38] of a Christian going to church trying to
[1:00:40] live uh as best they can I would
[1:00:43] begrudge anybody of that
[1:00:46] but until this process
[1:00:48] of the spirit of God coming and
[1:00:51] anointing you and filling you with his
[1:00:52] Spirit to where you and him become one
[1:00:55] uh to be a born-again Christian it's
[1:00:59] just a confession so when I changed my
[1:01:02] verbiage I went from saying I was
[1:01:05] baptized to saying I'm born again
[1:01:08] that's what I say so there's but that's
[1:01:10] just me now somebody a lot of people
[1:01:12] will still continue if you do or
[1:01:14] whatever uh I've been baptized with the
[1:01:17] Holy Ghost that's I I understand what a
[1:01:20] person says that I understand it uh I
[1:01:22] just don't say that personally because
[1:01:24] for me I've been born again not just
[1:01:27] baptized I've been born again of the
[1:01:30] spirit of God that shows that that that
[1:01:32] that says that I have Christ Living in
[1:01:36] me amen I have Christ Living in me now
[1:01:40] let's go over to and and start with this
[1:01:43] false anointed part
[1:01:45] I'll go ahead and pull this over so we
[1:01:47] can continue to
[1:01:49] see don't know that
[1:01:52] oh
[1:01:53] work with it anymore but
[1:01:56] uh in remembrance of the trial being the
[1:01:59] body of the spirit the soul because
[1:02:00] that's the teaching of that is what
[1:02:02] helps us understand this whole teaching
[1:02:05] that we're talking about because these
[1:02:08] two Realms here the two Realms of the
[1:02:10] body and the spirit are subject to the
[1:02:13] things of the world but the soul when
[1:02:16] it's born again of God then it just has
[1:02:19] God
[1:02:20] living in you it's not affected by the
[1:02:22] world right had the world has nothing to
[1:02:25] do with your soul if you've been born
[1:02:27] again amen but it can affect the spirit
[1:02:30] and the body
[1:02:32] uh and even people that are of the false
[1:02:35] anointed of that will get in to that
[1:02:38] body in that spirit so let's go to
[1:02:40] Matthew chapter 24 as I said I'm going
[1:02:43] to read a few scriptures quotes
[1:02:48] Matthew 24 verse 21.
[1:02:57] if you have listened to the anointed
[1:03:00] ones at the end time
[1:03:02] a lot of this will be very familiar to
[1:03:04] you
[1:03:07] Matthew 24 21.
[1:03:10] and then shall be Great Tribulation such
[1:03:13] as was not since the beginning of the
[1:03:16] world to this time no nor ever shall be
[1:03:21] and accept those days be should be
[1:03:25] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[1:03:28] but for the elect's sake these days
[1:03:32] shall be shortened for the elect's sake
[1:03:35] amen so what does that tell you that
[1:03:38] tells you that the election days will be
[1:03:40] shortened amen which
[1:03:43] State and sometimes it seems like it's
[1:03:46] gone on longer than it should but
[1:03:48] actually it can't it couldn't be because
[1:03:51] the Bible says they would be shortened
[1:03:52] yes
[1:03:53] then if any man shall say unto you Lo
[1:03:56] here low here is Christ or there believe
[1:04:00] it not
[1:04:01] for there shall arise false christs and
[1:04:05] false prophets and shall show great
[1:04:09] signs and wonders and so much that if it
[1:04:13] were uh possible they shall deceive the
[1:04:17] very elect now praise God it is not
[1:04:20] possible right for the elect to be
[1:04:22] deceived
[1:04:24] because
[1:04:25] she's become him the only reason that
[1:04:30] you could not be deceived is that you've
[1:04:33] been born again and the two of you have
[1:04:36] become one
[1:04:37] and he is the word yes and if he is the
[1:04:41] word and you become one with him that
[1:04:45] makes you the word
[1:04:46] well if you're the word you cannot be
[1:04:49] deceived right right because you're the
[1:04:51] word it's like I've said many times
[1:04:53] before
[1:04:54] you could never convince me that I'm a
[1:04:57] Chinese woman
[1:04:58] never why I know better
[1:05:02] I know who I am you there's no way to
[1:05:05] deceive me of that because of who I am
[1:05:09] and if you are the word then anything
[1:05:12] contrary to the word could never deceive
[1:05:15] you because you know better
[1:05:18] you cannot be deceived you could not be
[1:05:21] deceived any more than God could be
[1:05:23] deceived
[1:05:24] amen so thank God but but it is going to
[1:05:30] it will look so much like the real that
[1:05:34] it couldn't it would just seem to like
[1:05:36] if it was at all possible yeah
[1:05:38] what does that tell me that tells me
[1:05:40] that everybody without the spirit of God
[1:05:43] without being born again will be
[1:05:45] deceived yes yes if it's that close
[1:05:48] everyone other than the born-again elect
[1:05:50] will be deceived amen would the signs
[1:05:55] and wonders false Christ false anointed
[1:05:59] amen anointed anointed of what the
[1:06:02] spirit
[1:06:03] but false to what
[1:06:06] amen look because they are anointed of
[1:06:09] the correct spirit
[1:06:10] remember we talked about I'll read the
[1:06:12] scripture in a minute the spirit follows
[1:06:15] on the spirit of God fell on everyone on
[1:06:18] All Flesh
[1:06:20] so their anointed of the correct spirit
[1:06:23] but they are false how could they be
[1:06:27] false and still Anointed with the
[1:06:30] correct Spirit Well the anointing falls
[1:06:32] on the just and the unjust yeah but
[1:06:35] they're false because they're anti-word
[1:06:38] they're against the word amen that's how
[1:06:42] you know
[1:06:43] against the word They Don't Preach the
[1:06:46] pure Gospel of their day
[1:06:48] amen let's let me read you something
[1:06:51] here I told you it's going to read some
[1:06:53] quotes
[1:06:55] amen because remember
[1:06:57] power without character is satanic right
[1:07:00] amen power without the character to be
[1:07:03] able to orchestrate it is satanic so if
[1:07:06] God gave the power to people to do these
[1:07:09] things without the character of God you
[1:07:11] see people today that have all kinds of
[1:07:13] power in this world all kinds of
[1:07:15] authority all kinds of money but don't
[1:07:17] have the character of God
[1:07:20] well where are those people leading this
[1:07:22] place into what are they leading this
[1:07:24] country into what are they leading this
[1:07:26] world into
[1:07:30] Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:07:32] Armageddon
[1:07:34] the end
[1:07:36] their power but they don't have the
[1:07:39] character of God to orchestrate it right
[1:07:41] amen that's why it takes a born-again
[1:07:44] child of God to be able to be entrusted
[1:07:47] with the power to know how to use it
[1:07:49] control it only by the working of God
[1:07:53] and the Holy Spirit and the direction of
[1:07:55] God in their lives that's the only way
[1:07:57] they can do it which is the character of
[1:08:00] God Amen power without character is
[1:08:03] satanic now these people are anointed of
[1:08:06] the correct Spirit they're anointed of
[1:08:08] the holy spirit amen but they are false
[1:08:12] because they're against the word look
[1:08:14] here
[1:08:15] anointed once at the end time
[1:08:20] now uh he says Sunday school lesson try
[1:08:23] to bring this real show down by the
[1:08:24] scriptures uh
[1:08:27] not by the scriptures not by what
[1:08:30] someone else has said about it but just
[1:08:33] by the scripture
[1:08:35] you may say how can this be with the
[1:08:38] anointed ones where were they Christ
[1:08:40] c-h-r-s-t anointed at Christ means
[1:08:43] anointed one we know that Christ
[1:08:46] literally means anointed one
[1:08:49] anointed Christ's plural
[1:08:52] false prophets plural anointed ones but
[1:08:58] falsely
[1:08:59] Jesus said that the rain falls on the
[1:09:02] just and the unjust now someone might
[1:09:04] say to me do you believe that that
[1:09:06] anointing on these people means that
[1:09:09] it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit he
[1:09:12] said yes sir
[1:09:14] amen yes sir by the scripture yes sir
[1:09:18] the genuine holy spirit of God upon a
[1:09:21] person and yet they are false
[1:09:24] praise God how are they false by the
[1:09:27] word
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] that makes me wonder since when you look
[1:09:34] today I I I saw billboard
[1:09:37] coming down the interstate Friday in
[1:09:39] Houston going from the job to the uh to
[1:09:42] the airport the Hotel by the airport and
[1:09:45] I see this huge billboard advertisement
[1:09:47] of a church nothing against that
[1:09:49] you know very nice
[1:09:51] and it has a picture of the pastor I
[1:09:54] guess it is with the ear thing on in the
[1:09:55] microphone
[1:09:57] and and his posturing is
[1:10:00] uh uh like like he's
[1:10:04] uh giving a great speech
[1:10:08] like a lot of preachers you'd see today
[1:10:11] and somehow when I looked at that the
[1:10:14] spear I felt the spirit spoke to me and
[1:10:16] said when did preachers get from
[1:10:19] preaching the gospel to just giving a
[1:10:22] good speech to a group of people right
[1:10:25] it seems like nowadays all it is that
[1:10:28] people are interested in is it's going
[1:10:30] to church to have a nice a nice uh speak
[1:10:33] of speech spoken to them
[1:10:36] not the gospel priest down with the fire
[1:10:39] Brimstone of hell that caused people to
[1:10:42] repent and
[1:10:44] said when did he get to that place
[1:10:46] friend if you if Church came down to a
[1:10:50] bunch of people that that pastors that
[1:10:52] were great Orchards friend I'm in
[1:10:54] trouble
[1:10:57] because you've got you could never
[1:10:59] consider me a great orator
[1:11:02] but when the Holy Spirit comes when God
[1:11:05] takes control it's more than just a nice
[1:11:08] little speech or a little thing of
[1:11:10] teaching something here and there and
[1:11:12] giving a nice or the sky is beautiful
[1:11:15] blue and the grass is so green and life
[1:11:18] is so good and you are your own God and
[1:11:20] you just
[1:11:22] it just I I'm sorry for him and it just
[1:11:25] almost makes me sick to my stomach
[1:11:28] well let's where does it get to the
[1:11:31] place that we're to preach the gospel
[1:11:33] yeah to every creature
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:38] begins to End season out of season it's
[1:11:40] not to be a speech but there's an
[1:11:43] anointing
[1:11:45] but it's falsely because they're not
[1:11:48] preaching the word yes amen
[1:11:51] look down let me continue yes sir the
[1:11:54] genuine Holy Ghost of God upon a person
[1:11:57] yet they are false now listen close he
[1:12:00] says and see what he said
[1:12:03] and they shall show signs and wonders
[1:12:06] amen you go back to revelation 13.
[1:12:09] amen the false prophet that calls down
[1:12:12] in Miracles and things that actually
[1:12:14] happen
[1:12:17] signs and wonders isn't so much of a
[1:12:20] deceived and very elect if it were
[1:12:22] possible and they are anointed there you
[1:12:25] go there's our word what was the what
[1:12:28] was that synonymous with a synonym
[1:12:33] it was a synonym of on not in
[1:12:36] they are anointed with the genuine Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost no reference to an indwelling
[1:12:43] presence no reference of a new birth no
[1:12:46] reference to Christ Living but an
[1:12:49] anointing
[1:12:51] he's God that's what makes them false
[1:12:54] christs
[1:12:55] they're Christ because they're anointed
[1:12:58] ones but they are false because they are
[1:13:00] against the word
[1:13:02] they'd rather preach some Seminary dog
[1:13:05] mother or their own idea or their own
[1:13:07] interpretation instead of what the pure
[1:13:10] word of God has brought and what it has
[1:13:12] brought to us for this day am I through
[1:13:15] a Vindicated Prophet messenger yes yes
[1:13:18] William Marion Brown yeah
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:22] where is the word they were anointed I
[1:13:26] know it sounds very foolish
[1:13:28] but we're going to take time he talks
[1:13:31] about explaining this now
[1:13:33] to explain this to help people see it to
[1:13:37] help people understand it let's take a
[1:13:39] couple of other scriptures before I get
[1:13:41] too far on this now let's go back to
[1:13:43] Acts chapter 2.
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:49] we'll read these couple of scriptures
[1:13:51] again and then we'll go back to Matthew
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:58] because it helps us to understand by the
[1:14:00] scripture not just what brother Branham
[1:14:03] said
[1:14:04] look friend I trust him and believe him
[1:14:06] as the prophet of God I believe the Lord
[1:14:08] spoke to brother Branham and gave us the
[1:14:10] word of God for this hour and then what
[1:14:11] we needed to be able to get a bride out
[1:14:13] perfected and out of a and out of this
[1:14:16] world in a rapture
[1:14:18] but I don't take everything brother
[1:14:19] random just says I want to be able to
[1:14:21] find the scripture for myself right yes
[1:14:23] amen amen now if I can't find it or if
[1:14:26] it hasn't been revealed to me what did I
[1:14:28] tell you I take him put it on the Shelf
[1:14:31] amen and when sometimes that comes by
[1:14:34] the Lord Joseph said there it is I don't
[1:14:36] say I don't believe what brother
[1:14:37] Graham's saying unless it's just an
[1:14:39] error like he's 1965 but he says it's
[1:14:42] 1964. I'm not talking about stuff like
[1:14:45] that I'm talking about a real doctrinal
[1:14:47] issues in the scripture and I don't see
[1:14:49] it I don't discount it or say brother
[1:14:51] randoms wrong
[1:14:53] I just I don't understand it
[1:14:56] Lord help me to see this and where it
[1:14:59] fits in the scripture amen I put many a
[1:15:01] puzzle together my mom loved puzzles my
[1:15:04] sister loved puzzles and I put media
[1:15:06] postal together and I put puzzles
[1:15:08] together and there are three fours
[1:15:09] together I get a piece I have absolutely
[1:15:11] no clue where it goes I'll look I say
[1:15:14] this doesn't have the color of this it
[1:15:16] doesn't have the shape of that it
[1:15:18] doesn't look like this it looks like
[1:15:20] this piece comes from a completely
[1:15:21] different puzzle
[1:15:23] amen amen but then sometimes you start
[1:15:27] putting the thing together and put it
[1:15:29] together and then you're like well
[1:15:30] there's something missing here and you
[1:15:32] go look at the piece you set to the side
[1:15:33] and there it is and it fits perfect
[1:15:36] amen sometimes that's just what God does
[1:15:39] that's a carnal interpretation obviously
[1:15:41] it's more of a revelation from God the
[1:15:44] show said yes that's where it fits
[1:15:45] praise the Lord that's God doing it not
[1:15:48] you doing it that's God doing it acts
[1:15:50] chapter 2 now verse 14.
[1:15:54] but Peter's standing up now this is of
[1:15:57] course after this is the Pentecost but
[1:16:00] after the spirit has fallen and they've
[1:16:02] started to speak with tongues and
[1:16:04] knocking out the walls and people
[1:16:05] watching them and calling them names and
[1:16:07] saying they're drunk and but Peter's
[1:16:10] standing up with the 11. lifted up his
[1:16:13] voice and said unto them ye men of Judea
[1:16:16] and all you that dwell at Jerusalem be
[1:16:18] this known unto you and hearken to my
[1:16:20] words now remember what Jesus told Peter
[1:16:25] amen amen remember what Jesus told Peter
[1:16:28] yes
[1:16:29] and Peter was uh influenced by the wrong
[1:16:32] spirit
[1:16:33] and Jesus had to say get thee behind me
[1:16:36] Satan
[1:16:37] amen he said
[1:16:40] Satan has desired to sift you as weak
[1:16:43] but I have prayed for you
[1:16:45] and when you're converted when the
[1:16:48] spirit comes on you you strengthen the
[1:16:51] brothers the that's what he told Peter
[1:16:53] to do now what's Peter doing fulfilling
[1:16:56] the word of Christ right here
[1:16:59] strengthening the brothers hearken to my
[1:17:02] words
[1:17:03] for these are not drunk as ye supposed
[1:17:05] seeing it is about the third hour of the
[1:17:07] day
[1:17:08] but this is that which was spoken by the
[1:17:10] prophet Joel and it shall come going
[1:17:13] back to the going back to the old
[1:17:15] Prophet Joel in the Old Testament Amen
[1:17:18] to pull that out to help them understand
[1:17:20] this is prophecy fulfilled
[1:17:23] this day that scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:27] Joel said it now it's happening
[1:17:31] this is what Joel said he shall come to
[1:17:33] pass in the last days when we've gone
[1:17:35] into the last days think again
[1:17:38] saith God I will pour out pour out of my
[1:17:43] spirit upon All Flesh praise the Lord so
[1:17:48] when God poured that Spirit out on the
[1:17:51] day of Pentecost he poured it out in a
[1:17:54] literal engulfing of the entire world of
[1:17:57] humanity itself
[1:17:59] amen not just in the upper room
[1:18:03] he poured that Spirit out on All Flesh
[1:18:07] now that anointing lays instead
[1:18:11] and stands and as a belt that's over
[1:18:15] this Earth for all Humanity from that
[1:18:18] time forward wow it wasn't just for
[1:18:21] those people it was for those who ever
[1:18:23] will
[1:18:25] and it's there yet still today and it
[1:18:28] will still be there listen this now it
[1:18:31] will still be there even after the
[1:18:33] bride's gone
[1:18:35] yeah there will be Miracles and things
[1:18:37] that are unexplainable according to the
[1:18:40] scripture happen after the bride is gone
[1:18:42] yeah
[1:18:43] yeah so that anointing will still be
[1:18:45] there
[1:18:46] why will this still be there because
[1:18:49] when the bride leaves God's not done
[1:18:52] he goes to the Jews yes well how does he
[1:18:56] go to the Jews with that same anointing
[1:18:59] it started there here it is we've just
[1:19:02] read the start
[1:19:03] it left them and came to the judge
[1:19:06] well the Gentiles are finished and gone
[1:19:09] it goes back to the Jews so that
[1:19:10] anointing still here
[1:19:13] praise the Lord it will still be here
[1:19:15] that's on All Flesh
[1:19:18] your sons your daughter shall prophesy
[1:19:20] your young men shall see Vision your old
[1:19:22] men shall green dreams that's a
[1:19:25] fulfillment of the scripture
[1:19:27] by that anointing by that Spirit now
[1:19:32] they did it here and they spoke in
[1:19:34] tongues
[1:19:35] but not everybody that speaks in tongues
[1:19:37] has the born-again experience of the
[1:19:40] Holy Ghost they have an anointing that's
[1:19:43] fallen on them you see people all the
[1:19:46] time
[1:19:47] raised in their hands what do we tell oh
[1:19:50] I mentioned last week about uh in in
[1:19:54] Charlotte and and the Bakers and that
[1:19:56] time that Tammy Baker said so and so
[1:19:58] that anointing was their friend it was
[1:20:00] so powerful on those people they took
[1:20:03] out their wallets and was throwing money
[1:20:05] off the balcony
[1:20:06] just because this painted up Jezebel
[1:20:09] said she saw ten dollar bills raining
[1:20:12] down from heaven
[1:20:14] amen it was an anointing right they were
[1:20:17] under that anointing just because a
[1:20:20] person dances just cause a person speaks
[1:20:22] in tongues just because a perfect person
[1:20:24] has a gift or a prophecy or something
[1:20:26] does not mean that they're a child of
[1:20:28] God right it does not mean that they are
[1:20:30] born again
[1:20:31] yeah amen
[1:20:32] because that spirit is on All Flesh that
[1:20:36] anointing is on All Flesh
[1:20:39] amen now let's go one more scripture and
[1:20:42] I'll then we'll
[1:20:44] continue on from there Matthew chapter
[1:20:46] five now
[1:20:48] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:20:54] Jesus says the exact same thing
[1:20:58] people want to
[1:21:01] make a contrary
[1:21:03] to Peter and Jesus when it comes to
[1:21:07] baptism
[1:21:09] I've talked to people as you may have
[1:21:12] about baptism in the name Christian
[1:21:14] baptism as if we recognize it as in the
[1:21:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:19] amen non-Christian baptism is any other
[1:21:22] way
[1:21:23] but Christian baptism is in the name of
[1:21:25] the Lord Jesus Christ and you go and
[1:21:27] explain those to that to people and say
[1:21:29] that Peter on the day of Pentecost said
[1:21:32] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:36] and then they would say but Jesus said I
[1:21:39] Then I then my rebuttal is then how
[1:21:43] could Peter be saying anything contrary
[1:21:46] to Jesus
[1:21:49] he's got to be saying the same thing
[1:21:51] Jesus said you just don't understand it
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:56] because Peter first of all had the keys
[1:22:00] to the kingdom of heaven
[1:22:02] and Jesus told him
[1:22:05] whatever you bound on Earth is bound in
[1:22:08] heaven so when Peter's standing forth on
[1:22:10] the day of Pentecost and says be
[1:22:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:15] that's Bound in heaven
[1:22:17] because Peter had the keys
[1:22:20] Jesus gave them to him right
[1:22:23] not only that but Peter right there
[1:22:27] freshly out of the uh out of the
[1:22:30] anointing and the filling of the Holy
[1:22:32] Spirit
[1:22:33] a person wants to tell you that Peter is
[1:22:36] now born again
[1:22:38] fill the spirit of God one with Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ and is going to say something
[1:22:44] contrary to the word the word
[1:22:47] will happen
[1:22:49] it's impossible Peter Peter's not going
[1:22:53] to say something contrary to just and
[1:22:55] people say well I'll just take what
[1:22:56] Jesus said well then if you take what
[1:22:58] Jesus is you better take what Peter said
[1:23:00] yes
[1:23:01] because it's the same thing and when you
[1:23:04] understand it by Revelation you realize
[1:23:06] that being baptized in the name of
[1:23:07] father son the holy ghost in the name
[1:23:11] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:14] the same thing it's not different well
[1:23:17] Peter here is doing the same thing when
[1:23:19] Peter now is quoting Joel
[1:23:22] he also recognized we can recognize and
[1:23:25] reference that Jesus said the same thing
[1:23:28] look
[1:23:30] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:23:33] verse 43.
[1:23:35] ye have heard you have heard that it has
[1:23:37] been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:23:40] and hate thine enemy
[1:23:42] but I say unto you now this one
[1:23:45] scripture a lot of people don't want to
[1:23:46] have anything to do with
[1:23:48] it because we're too
[1:23:50] wrapped up in hating people who don't
[1:23:52] like us
[1:23:53] we're too wrapped up in getting away
[1:23:55] from people who may not agree with us
[1:23:57] we're too busy being angry at other
[1:24:00] people for things that we have no
[1:24:03] business being angry or holding grudges
[1:24:05] about
[1:24:07] but Jesus said Thou shalt love thy name
[1:24:11] or or he said you have heard it said
[1:24:14] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:24:16] thine enemy
[1:24:18] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:24:22] now how many people actually do that
[1:24:24] yeah God help me
[1:24:27] but how many people actually do that
[1:24:30] they love their enemies
[1:24:33] my contention is if you love everybody
[1:24:37] every human the way you should with the
[1:24:41] love with the agape love of God you
[1:24:44] shouldn't have any enemies
[1:24:46] now there are people that may consider
[1:24:48] you their enemy
[1:24:50] but you won't consider that an enemy
[1:24:53] because you love them too much right
[1:24:55] because you have an unconditional love
[1:24:58] of God for that person how could that
[1:25:00] person be an enemy
[1:25:02] yeah amen amen
[1:25:05] now I'm talking personal I'm not talking
[1:25:07] scriptural they may be enemies to the
[1:25:09] word things like that and they may
[1:25:11] consider you an enemy and I'm talking
[1:25:12] about personally amen if you love them
[1:25:15] right but Jesus said I say unto you love
[1:25:18] your enemies
[1:25:19] bless them that curse you
[1:25:23] know how many do that
[1:25:26] do good to them that hate you now how
[1:25:28] many do that
[1:25:31] pray for them which despitefully use you
[1:25:34] and persecute you
[1:25:36] oh I pray for that person
[1:25:38] that they die tomorrow
[1:25:42] amen I mean that literally what a lot of
[1:25:46] people's actions are are portrayed right
[1:25:48] I'm praying for them yeah but what are
[1:25:51] you praying
[1:25:53] what is your prayer oh
[1:25:56] bless that personal God help
[1:26:00] you know that's just that's just the
[1:26:03] work of the devil's things yes amen
[1:26:07] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:26:09] and persecute you that ye may be the
[1:26:13] children of your father which is in
[1:26:15] heaven for he maketh his son s-u-n now
[1:26:20] to rise on the evil and on the good
[1:26:25] and sendeth Reign on the just and the
[1:26:29] unjust
[1:26:30] which means that the people that are
[1:26:32] evil Wicked demonic mean murders rapists
[1:26:38] drug dealers users politicians
[1:26:43] All the Above
[1:26:46] God loves him
[1:26:49] he makes the sun rise on them just as he
[1:26:53] makes it rise on me yes and you
[1:26:56] he gives them water and rain and
[1:26:59] sustained life-sustaining resources just
[1:27:02] like he does me and you
[1:27:04] amen yes
[1:27:07] that is an example to help us understand
[1:27:09] that God loves them too yes he does Amen
[1:27:14] that shows us how precious life really
[1:27:17] is life is so precious to God that we've
[1:27:21] talked about before so precious to God
[1:27:24] that every one of them that Souls were
[1:27:27] 10 million worlds oh praise God then if
[1:27:31] that's the case how can we be so mean
[1:27:35] and ornery and vindictive against people
[1:27:40] amen amen I I've literally had
[1:27:44] people I know back when we were in North
[1:27:46] Carolina
[1:27:48] come to me and say oh you know I think
[1:27:52] I'm just going to leave I'm just going
[1:27:53] to leave the church
[1:27:55] this is before we ever move to Florida
[1:27:57] this is in North Carolina you know in in
[1:28:00] the early 90s probably late 80s early
[1:28:02] 90s probably early 90s
[1:28:04] it's Emily and I said what's the matter
[1:28:06] what's going on one of the
[1:28:10] book right back didn't even shake my
[1:28:12] hand today
[1:28:14] I said brother are you serious with me
[1:28:17] now I probably didn't say it quite like
[1:28:20] that uh it's probably a little more
[1:28:22] discreet but so are you really telling
[1:28:25] me that you're going to lead the church
[1:28:26] because he may not have shook your hand
[1:28:29] today
[1:28:30] I mean honestly that has stuck with me
[1:28:34] so much that's why I walk from this
[1:28:37] Pulpit out to that door and wait and try
[1:28:39] to shake everybody's hand before they
[1:28:41] leave it
[1:28:42] that's honest truth not that I I want to
[1:28:45] too obviously
[1:28:46] but that that really you you see me
[1:28:49] screwed out quickly that's the reason
[1:28:51] because I go out there to make sure I
[1:28:53] don't want to miss anybody if I try and
[1:28:56] it probably happens from time to time
[1:28:57] but I try my best
[1:28:59] did not miss anybody shaking hands I
[1:29:02] thought that that
[1:29:04] I wonder why were you coming to church
[1:29:06] to begin with now the person didn't quit
[1:29:08] coming
[1:29:10] as why did you come to church to begin
[1:29:12] with
[1:29:14] I don't I don't come here to fellowship
[1:29:16] with you I love you all and I love your
[1:29:18] fellowship I come here because of Christ
[1:29:20] in the word amen amen if I were to
[1:29:24] choose a church I wouldn't want to go to
[1:29:26] a church that I knew preach the pure
[1:29:28] unadulterated word of the hour yes amen
[1:29:31] and that's it I didn't care who went
[1:29:33] there I don't care what the person
[1:29:34] looked like
[1:29:36] Orchard or not I don't care
[1:29:39] just preach me the word amen that that's
[1:29:42] that's the thing that matters but but it
[1:29:45] gets into this personal struggle back
[1:29:47] and forth
[1:29:50] let's just go outside and just pick a
[1:29:53] bunch of daisies out of a field and he
[1:29:55] loves me he loves me not loves me loves
[1:29:58] me
[1:29:59] I mean that's childish yes but that's
[1:30:03] how it's gotten to the place that he's
[1:30:04] talking about God himself
[1:30:07] made it to where he and his creation had
[1:30:12] all of humanity enjoy the Sun the rain
[1:30:15] and all together it falls on the just
[1:30:17] and the unjust when the rain falls the
[1:30:20] weeds and the tares enjoy it just as
[1:30:22] much as the Grain and the and the
[1:30:24] flowers yes just as much it gets just as
[1:30:28] much life-sustaining resources as it
[1:30:31] needs as the stuff that's supposed to be
[1:30:34] there
[1:30:35] a vegetable garden or whatever it is
[1:30:37] when God sends that water it's on all of
[1:30:40] it it's on everybody and it's still here
[1:30:44] and it's still doing its work it hasn't
[1:30:47] changed but we have to different
[1:30:49] differentiate now look
[1:30:53] let me read this
[1:30:55] trying to do God of service
[1:30:58] he said now now look
[1:31:01] I want to try to draw this
[1:31:04] comparison contrast before we leave
[1:31:08] today
[1:31:09] and we'll again probably pick it up next
[1:31:11] Sunday trying to do god without a
[1:31:13] service without it being in service he
[1:31:15] said now didn't I tell you and then you
[1:31:18] come uh he's talking about uh Micah in
[1:31:22] the scripture
[1:31:23] and uh the Prophet come up and smacked
[1:31:26] him in the mouth you know he said which
[1:31:28] way the spirit of God go out of me in
[1:31:30] other words uh let me break it down he
[1:31:32] said
[1:31:33] I want to tell you something Micah now
[1:31:36] this is the the the one of uh ahab's
[1:31:40] prophets uh that had the sign of the
[1:31:43] Prophet the horn and everything and all
[1:31:45] this they come forth saying all these
[1:31:47] things and uh stuff that obviously
[1:31:49] didn't happen uh were they ever held
[1:31:52] accountable when it didn't happen
[1:31:54] probably not a lot of things don't
[1:31:57] change either but he had that sign
[1:32:00] and and Micah come out one man against
[1:32:03] 400 and said their prophecy is wrong
[1:32:06] what I'm telling you is the word of God
[1:32:09] and what I'm saying is going to happen
[1:32:11] you can believe it or not
[1:32:13] and
[1:32:15] zedekiah I think it was come and smacked
[1:32:18] him in the mouth said where the spirit
[1:32:19] of God go when he left out of me and
[1:32:21] Michael said you'll find out
[1:32:23] now brother Brown's starting to
[1:32:24] paraphrase
[1:32:25] I want to tell you something Mike could
[1:32:27] you realize that I'm a master in the
[1:32:29] scripture do you realize that I have the
[1:32:32] anointing or the baptism as we would say
[1:32:36] today
[1:32:37] amen
[1:32:39] that's what brother Brandon that's his
[1:32:40] word
[1:32:41] do you realize he's talking about
[1:32:43] zedekiah but he's bringing it down to
[1:32:46] the modern day
[1:32:48] do you realize that I have the anointing
[1:32:50] or the baptism as we would say today so
[1:32:53] brother Brown there comparing
[1:32:56] the two anointing baptism same thing
[1:33:00] or the baptism as we would say today do
[1:33:03] you realize that I had uh said that
[1:33:06] um
[1:33:09] now brother Brown says
[1:33:11] that doesn't sound right
[1:33:14] anyway the prophet that the one of the
[1:33:17] prophets there that was against what
[1:33:19] Micah was saying the head profit if you
[1:33:21] will bringing false Prophecy with with
[1:33:24] Ahab and uh and him going up to battle
[1:33:28] and he said but brother Branham here the
[1:33:31] point I want to make this quote is
[1:33:33] comparing the baptism the anointing
[1:33:36] together
[1:33:37] immersing something of bringing together
[1:33:40] in an immersion amen be mercing together
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:46] let me see I've got a couple more of
[1:33:48] these and I want to read to you
[1:33:50] I told you I had a few we'll try to
[1:33:52] finish this up before we leave
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:59] things that are to be
[1:34:04] you see here I want to make sure I want
[1:34:05] to read this one first
[1:34:08] things that are to be Rialto California
[1:34:11] now I've got
[1:34:14] um I've got the Baptist this is the
[1:34:16] quote now eight brother bam says I've
[1:34:18] got the baptism of the Holy Spirit he
[1:34:21] said that's still he's quoting
[1:34:24] that would say that and people say well
[1:34:26] I've got the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:28] he says that still has nothing to do
[1:34:31] with it
[1:34:32] that's just only a temporal gift for you
[1:34:38] temporal gift for you
[1:34:40] the real gift is your soul down in there
[1:34:46] amen so what's he comparing that baptism
[1:34:49] of the Holy Spirit as being on the body
[1:34:52] on the spirit on the human spirit
[1:34:55] but he's come but he's differentiating
[1:34:57] between the body and the human spirit
[1:35:00] with the soul
[1:35:02] because the body in the human Spirit are
[1:35:05] subject to the world but the soul
[1:35:07] belongs to God
[1:35:09] that's God so there's a separating Point
[1:35:11] here to understand these two could be
[1:35:14] subject to the world but this Soul
[1:35:16] belongs to God
[1:35:18] and he says a person I got the baptism
[1:35:20] in the holy spirit that has nothing to
[1:35:22] do with it that baptism of the holy
[1:35:24] spirit is only a temporal or temporary
[1:35:28] gift for you
[1:35:30] the real gift is your soul down in there
[1:35:33] see
[1:35:34] that was born of God and that controls
[1:35:37] the whole thing or the whole body to the
[1:35:40] word of God and the will of God and
[1:35:43] there the soul is where you grow up see
[1:35:47] then you become as you would a son or
[1:35:50] daughter of God
[1:35:52] by birth
[1:35:54] by birth in the soul not by baptism of
[1:35:59] the flesh but a birth in the soul
[1:36:02] that's what controls it that's what
[1:36:05] makes you a new person amen amen now
[1:36:08] listen
[1:36:09] um
[1:36:10] the rapture
[1:36:13] the Rapture myth so brother let him get
[1:36:15] didn't just
[1:36:17] talk about this or bring this subject
[1:36:21] out to in only the anointing ones at the
[1:36:24] end time he did it in many many other
[1:36:27] scriptures uh doing trying to do God of
[1:36:31] service was priests in Louisiana
[1:36:33] the ranch was preached in Yuma the uh
[1:36:37] things that are to be Rialto California
[1:36:40] so it wasn't just anointed ones at the
[1:36:42] end time in Jeffersonville that brother
[1:36:44] Brown taught this subject
[1:36:47] or tried to get people to understand
[1:36:49] that we're jumping and dancing and
[1:36:51] speaking in tongues and manifesting
[1:36:53] these gifts to think that they're that
[1:36:55] that was their solidification or their
[1:36:58] justification of being a child of God
[1:37:00] when it wasn't
[1:37:02] because he said they could
[1:37:04] speaking tongues all they want go
[1:37:06] outside and live like a devil
[1:37:08] well
[1:37:10] that that didn't prove anything other
[1:37:13] than a gift
[1:37:14] and brother Ram's saying now that's just
[1:37:17] a temporal gift
[1:37:19] that baptism that anointing that those
[1:37:22] people operate under is simply and we do
[1:37:25] too we enjoy that anointing as well not
[1:37:27] just them but that's all they have
[1:37:31] that's what they operate under is only a
[1:37:34] temporal gift
[1:37:37] it's here just for now it doesn't it
[1:37:40] doesn't do anything to save you it
[1:37:43] brings you to being born again
[1:37:47] but it doesn't help you go on a rapture
[1:37:50] because the token's the only thing that
[1:37:51] put you in a Rapture not an anointing
[1:37:55] not a baptism the token a new birth is
[1:37:58] what puts you in a rapture
[1:38:00] amen thank God I'm born again
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] the Rapture now let me read this one
[1:38:11] oh certainly not they would not stand
[1:38:13] for that let me read let me see
[1:38:16] let me just start up here I don't want
[1:38:18] to I feel like I'm being in a hurry and
[1:38:20] I shouldn't be
[1:38:21] the Rapture let me just read this whole
[1:38:23] quote don't the Bible say in the last
[1:38:26] days there shall come false christs not
[1:38:30] false Jesus
[1:38:31] but false Christ anointed ones
[1:38:35] falsely anointed to the word
[1:38:38] denominational anointed but not to the
[1:38:42] word
[1:38:43] denomination anointed but not to the
[1:38:46] word dogma anointed but not word
[1:38:50] anointed amen
[1:38:53] for the word will be a record of itself
[1:38:56] it don't need nothing else it'll bear a
[1:38:58] record record to itself and there will
[1:39:01] come false anointed ones you got my tape
[1:39:04] on that anointed ones he said
[1:39:06] oh are you with Jesus oh they wouldn't
[1:39:09] certainly they wouldn't say I'm Jesus
[1:39:11] they wouldn't stand for that but when it
[1:39:13] comes to Oh Glory to God I got the
[1:39:15] anointing and it's the agenda and this
[1:39:18] is gentleman anointing
[1:39:19] that's why brother random wants the
[1:39:21] people to understand it is the genuine
[1:39:24] anointing he said remember K Ephesus had
[1:39:28] it too and prophesied
[1:39:31] so did Balaam have it and prophesy but
[1:39:34] that don't have nothing
[1:39:37] nothing to do with this inside
[1:39:42] now that's the point Saints
[1:39:44] that anointing baptism doesn't have
[1:39:49] nothing to do with the inside
[1:39:54] amen
[1:39:55] praise the Lord unless that was God's
[1:39:58] seed his Gene from the beginning
[1:40:01] predestinated you are finished I don't
[1:40:04] care how much you shout speak with
[1:40:06] tongues run shout that has nothing to do
[1:40:09] with it mine
[1:40:11] a customer can count just as much as any
[1:40:13] of the rest of them I've seen heathens
[1:40:16] raise and shout and speak in tongues
[1:40:18] simply a drink blood of a human skull
[1:40:20] calling the devil wow
[1:40:23] see you don't any of them Sensations
[1:40:26] things he said forget about it it's your
[1:40:28] heart and that word
[1:40:31] that is Christ
[1:40:33] praise the Lord
[1:40:35] that's where it is
[1:40:37] it's close
[1:40:39] but that's where it is the anointing the
[1:40:43] new birth
[1:40:45] Christ coming on
[1:40:48] and in
[1:40:50] being a born-again Christian isn't just
[1:40:54] having a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:57] that baptism that anointing is a
[1:40:59] temporal gift for us now in temporal
[1:41:02] let's go back to this
[1:41:04] my time's getting away
[1:41:06] let's go back to this brother random
[1:41:08] says when you
[1:41:10] I think he used a reference of speed he
[1:41:13] said that Dove takes his flight goes out
[1:41:15] on a limit awaits
[1:41:16] amen
[1:41:18] what is a temporal gift
[1:41:20] it's temporary right
[1:41:23] what is what is a new birth
[1:41:26] a new birth is permanent according to
[1:41:28] the scripture yes amen a new birth is
[1:41:32] something that you get Christ the spirit
[1:41:34] of Jesus Christ coming the person I just
[1:41:37] like to say the weather the way brother
[1:41:38] Graham said it the person of Christ
[1:41:40] Living in you that's how he said it
[1:41:44] person of Christ Living in you seals you
[1:41:46] in there is permanent
[1:41:48] until your destination till we go to be
[1:41:51] with him
[1:41:52] sorry anymore
[1:41:54] this is temporal
[1:41:57] comes goes here there
[1:42:00] I mean we've had Services here where we
[1:42:02] felt the power of God fall so strong and
[1:42:05] you feel that pulsation happening and
[1:42:07] going around through this place and you
[1:42:10] go outside and where is it
[1:42:13] amen well he's still with you we know
[1:42:16] that right but that anointing like that
[1:42:20] isn't there anymore
[1:42:22] what is it it's simple it's just a
[1:42:24] temporal gift for us that anointing and
[1:42:27] thank God I enjoy it I appreciate the
[1:42:30] Lord a new birth
[1:42:32] when brother man says a refilling now I
[1:42:36] know the word feeling is confusing but
[1:42:38] all he's talking about is a fresh
[1:42:40] anointing
[1:42:41] a fresh anointing there cannot be a
[1:42:44] refilling of the Soul once he's sealed
[1:42:46] in out the we've said that many times
[1:42:49] amen
[1:42:51] temporal gift that's what he's talking
[1:42:53] about a temporal gift is just uh seen
[1:42:56] heathens Ray shout speaking tongues
[1:42:58] drink it drink above a human skull call
[1:42:59] the devil Indian Sensations it's your
[1:43:02] forget it he says it's your heart and
[1:43:04] that word word that separates amen
[1:43:09] that's what brings the differentiation
[1:43:10] that's what separates it gifts and
[1:43:13] callings Romans 11 29 I was going to
[1:43:15] read it but Romans 11 29 the gifts and
[1:43:18] callings of God of God I know we always
[1:43:22] say the Gibson colleagues are without
[1:43:23] repentance but the Bible says gifts and
[1:43:25] callings of God that's
[1:43:29] of God or without repentance
[1:43:32] so yes they come from God when did they
[1:43:35] come from God when he poured out his
[1:43:36] spirit
[1:43:38] when that anointing came down the gifts
[1:43:41] came with it
[1:43:43] praise the Lord
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:46] that's just the way God
[1:43:48] his way with us amen I know I'm getting
[1:43:52] away but let me let's see
[1:44:01] uh modern modern events make clear about
[1:44:03] prophecy let me go ahead and read it
[1:44:04] there's many people just can't believe
[1:44:06] it even Spirit-filled people I'm going
[1:44:09] to give you one that'll choke you
[1:44:12] obviously means a little controversial
[1:44:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean
[1:44:18] you're going in
[1:44:19] not at all
[1:44:22] not on that don't have anything to do
[1:44:25] with your soul
[1:44:27] brother Brown's thing
[1:44:29] a baptism of the Holy Ghost has nothing
[1:44:32] to do with your soul
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:36] I'm not going to try to change your
[1:44:37] verbiage in other peoples when you hear
[1:44:40] other people say that you understand
[1:44:42] what they mean
[1:44:43] amen they're talking about a new birth
[1:44:46] that's my assumption and belief I want
[1:44:49] to believe the better rather than the
[1:44:51] worst that's I believe that's what they
[1:44:53] mean
[1:44:54] but the brother Branham said the baptism
[1:44:56] the Holy Ghost does not mean that
[1:45:00] he did not mean that you're going in and
[1:45:02] all doesn't have anything to do with
[1:45:04] your soul that's just the baptism
[1:45:08] amen modern events this is on the road
[1:45:10] he's preaching this in California San
[1:45:12] Bernardino
[1:45:15] don't have anything to it here's the
[1:45:17] inside now he's got he's obviously got
[1:45:19] this drawing out he said the inside you
[1:45:22] have a spirit amen we got it you have
[1:45:25] the five Outlets uh
[1:45:29] um well he's talking about body I
[1:45:30] skipped over a part body Earthly home
[1:45:32] five sentences Spirit the outlets
[1:45:35] conscious inspection reason memory love
[1:45:37] so for five Outlets of that Spirit
[1:45:39] remember in that spirit in that Spirit
[1:45:43] you can be baptized with the genuine
[1:45:46] spirit of God and still be lost
[1:45:51] in the second realm of the human's being
[1:45:54] you can be baptized with that genuine
[1:45:57] spirit of God and still be lost
[1:46:01] now you tell me what that means
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:06] can only mean one thing in my opinion
[1:46:08] and that's what we've been talking about
[1:46:09] yes
[1:46:11] praise the Lord in that Spirit you can
[1:46:14] be baptized with the genuine spirit of
[1:46:16] God and still be lost it's the soul that
[1:46:19] lives yes that was ordained of God the
[1:46:23] soul that lives
[1:46:25] ah praise the Lord
[1:46:28] that's God's work
[1:46:30] it's the word
[1:46:32] it's the word that changes it it's the
[1:46:34] word that makes the difference yes amen
[1:46:37] the Bible says by their fruits you shall
[1:46:39] know them what is their fruit
[1:46:42] amen their fruit is their word yes it's
[1:46:45] what's coming out of them
[1:46:48] a fruit and a tree the fruit is what's
[1:46:50] coming out of the tree
[1:46:52] what's coming out of you
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] people always want to think about love
[1:47:00] and kindness and we know what the fruits
[1:47:02] of the spirit are absolutely but what
[1:47:04] are you speaking a lot of times we
[1:47:06] forget of the fruit of your lips we
[1:47:09] forget about the fruit of your lips yeah
[1:47:11] is that speaking the word because it's
[1:47:14] the word is what makes the difference
[1:47:15] yes amen
[1:47:20] I'm gonna read one more scripture I
[1:47:22] promise I'm gonna close here first John
[1:47:24] 4 1 be loved
[1:47:27] believe not every spirit
[1:47:30] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:47:33] God because many false prophets are gone
[1:47:36] out in the world what did Brother random
[1:47:38] call this scripture
[1:47:40] brother man I'm called this scripture
[1:47:42] the word test
[1:47:44] he said it says try them he says give
[1:47:47] them the word test
[1:47:49] if they can't pass the word test then
[1:47:52] that tells you who they are yes amen
[1:47:56] that tells you who they of who they are
[1:47:58] where they came from I got some more
[1:48:00] quotes I'm going to pass them but maybe
[1:48:02] next week
[1:48:04] but the word test is what makes a
[1:48:07] difference by their fruits you shall
[1:48:09] know them what are their fruits are they
[1:48:10] speaking the word yes are they saying
[1:48:13] the word are they believing the word are
[1:48:15] they living the word are they going to a
[1:48:17] church that preaches the word yes amen
[1:48:20] because that's the that's the separation
[1:48:22] point it's not whether it's
[1:48:25] gifts going and all these activities and
[1:48:28] things but is the word being preached
[1:48:31] amen amen it's not something that
[1:48:35] there there's nice messages sermons
[1:48:39] preached
[1:48:40] but
[1:48:41] I don't I don't personally come to
[1:48:44] church to have my intellect tickled
[1:48:46] or something that's going to make me
[1:48:49] feel like I could conquer the world
[1:48:53] I already know I've conquered the world
[1:48:55] because he did it for me
[1:48:57] amen I already know the world belongs to
[1:49:00] me because he bought it and gave it to
[1:49:02] me
[1:49:03] I don't need to know that the sky is
[1:49:05] blue and the grass is green
[1:49:07] I already know that but I know in whom I
[1:49:10] believe yes and my redeemer living
[1:49:13] amen
[1:49:16] let the word be the separating point to
[1:49:19] understand because a person without the
[1:49:22] new birth now you talk about anointing
[1:49:24] the devil's Satan can have anointing
[1:49:27] absolutely be anointed bring an
[1:49:30] anointing have that go on people that
[1:49:33] anointing on people and be absolutely as
[1:49:35] influenced by the devil as anything else
[1:49:38] amen amen but never could be born again
[1:49:42] never could be that Spirit live in them
[1:49:47] because he can't live the word
[1:49:51] yes amen let's stand if we could
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:05] it's
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:08] the separate application of the spirit
[1:50:12] is because of the difference causes the
[1:50:15] difference in people to the word and not
[1:50:19] to the word
[1:50:24] a knowledge
[1:50:26] of the word which a lot of people have a
[1:50:30] knowledge of the word
[1:50:32] Seminary is preaching knowledge of the
[1:50:34] word
[1:50:35] there's one thing that comes that's an
[1:50:38] external force on the body even in the
[1:50:42] spirit
[1:50:43] that that is that is uh a knowledge
[1:50:48] but a revelation does not come to your
[1:50:50] intellect a revelation from God is not
[1:50:53] something that tickles your intellect or
[1:50:55] or is interested in even coming into the
[1:50:58] the the spirit or the body
[1:51:01] that's something that's directly
[1:51:03] affected in the soul
[1:51:05] by the soul or Christ lives
[1:51:09] that Revelation is what separates and
[1:51:12] the word
[1:51:14] that comes and and shows you that that
[1:51:17] you've been born again you are a new
[1:51:20] creature
[1:51:21] because it's the word a revelation of
[1:51:25] the word of God not a knowledge of the
[1:51:28] word knowledge is fine
[1:51:30] amen but there's a lot of people have a
[1:51:32] knowledge
[1:51:33] but the revelation of the truth of this
[1:51:35] word can only come from one source and
[1:51:38] that's God the word himself
[1:51:40] and that shows that word in you is what
[1:51:44] makes you that person amen makes you
[1:51:48] that person
[1:51:49] praise the Lord let's sing this course
[1:51:52] this word this uh song again greater is
[1:51:56] he that is in me
[1:51:58] that is in the world

[1:52:04] greater is he that's in you
[1:52:07] views in the world

[1:53:55] Souls

[1:54:00] you I'm gonna let the whole world go
[1:54:03] foreign
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:36] amen amen thank you Jesus greater is he
[1:54:40] that is in US Saints today than he is in
[1:54:43] this world yes praise the Lord in US
[1:54:46] amen not just on in us the new birth
[1:54:51] praise the Lord that outward man he
[1:54:54] might deny Jesus even with an anointing
[1:54:57] he might not even be proud he's a
[1:55:00] Christian but in that Soul there is
[1:55:03] absolutely a new birth there's no
[1:55:05] denying sickness praise the Lord if
[1:55:09] you're born again of the spirit of God
[1:55:10] and the Holy Ghost lives in you you
[1:55:12] can't hide it
[1:55:14] you can try but you can't hide it
[1:55:16] because it shows who you really are yes
[1:55:19] amen and we belong to him praise the
[1:55:22] Lord Jesus amen God bless you pray
[1:55:26] something when set the blessing Street
[1:55:27] in today makes a little bit of
[1:55:30] understanding things we see in the world
[1:55:32] things that go on how people can be and
[1:55:35] how they can continue to operate and go
[1:55:37] on and
[1:55:39] um

[1:56:07] when I was in business we had a
[1:56:08] conference there at the conference

[1:56:29] the things that goes on today I told
[1:56:32] a guy I met on this trip and I'll keep
[1:56:36] you home and I met him on this this trip
[1:56:38] God working with us from a different
[1:56:40] team
[1:56:42] found out I was a preacher I said man
[1:56:44] people gossip around here
[1:56:46] so I'm just kidding up but yeah and I
[1:56:49] started talking to him and he's from
[1:56:51] Alabama South like I'm
[1:56:53] and he started telling me things oh this
[1:56:57] church that I went to and grew up in and
[1:56:59] he said I don't care much religion I
[1:57:00] said I don't either
[1:57:01] don't care at all for religion in fact
[1:57:04] all that is gives people an excuse to
[1:57:06] think they're okay and go live like a
[1:57:08] devil
[1:57:09] he's just a covering that's right I
[1:57:11] don't care for religion at all either he
[1:57:13] said well the church I used to go to has
[1:57:15] gotten so big and they have all these
[1:57:17] other churches now and all this I said
[1:57:19] yeah they seem to forget that scripture
[1:57:21] where Jesus said fear not little flock
[1:57:25] and he said I guess so
[1:57:27] amen but that's the truth that's what he
[1:57:30] said yes but praise the Lord amen
[1:57:32] greater is he that's in US good or not
