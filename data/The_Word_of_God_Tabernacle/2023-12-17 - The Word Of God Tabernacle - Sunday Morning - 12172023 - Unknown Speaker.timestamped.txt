[20:43] requests and that doesn't include the
[20:45] ones I read off my phone so um I
[20:48] appreciate your prayers for me this week
[20:50] it was a rough week um I loged 76 hours
[20:54] this week uh I got about an average of
[20:58] right at give or take 15 minutes five
[21:02] hours of sleep a night uh this week uh
[21:05] we went from location to location to
[21:07] location one different location every
[21:09] day uh some of the guys were there till
[21:11] 2: 4: and 6 o'clock in the morning we
[21:14] were under such a a strain to because
[21:17] these this was an acquisition and they
[21:19] only were going to be closed for one day
[21:21] and they were only they were only
[21:22] allowing to be closed for one day so
[21:25] everything we had to do had to be done
[21:27] that day and had to be ready to open at
[21:29] 7:00 the next morning uh so it it was
[21:33] quite a strain and it was it was a it
[21:36] was a pretty tough week uh actually that
[21:39] doesn't even include last Sunday's
[21:41] travel if you include that I logged I
[21:43] actually logged on my thing over 80
[21:46] hours uh those last seven days and two
[21:50] of those are travel days so uh it it was
[21:53] it was pretty tough we had I had almost
[21:55] an 18-hour day one day uh pretty close
[21:59] 11 17h hour day so it was kind of a
[22:02] rough week so I was exhausted yesterday
[22:04] I was able to stay up though till I got
[22:06] to bed uh so I was thankful for that
[22:09] because that gives helps me get a good
[22:11] night's rest during the night and praise

[22:21] somewhere but they canceled the week
[22:23] there's nothing for us to do so there's
[22:26] no job to send us to so I'm off really

[36:07] now as we commit all things to you in
[36:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[36:11] pray
[36:13] amen amen Matthew chap
[36:16] 11 verse 25 at at that time Jesus
[36:19] answered and said I thank thee oh Father
[36:23] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[36:24] has hid these things from the and
[36:27] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[36:30] amen you could be seated if you'd
[36:33] like amen praise the Lord God is thank
[36:37] God is Mindful and we're so very
[36:38] thankful to him for it now let's go back
[36:40] to Genesis want to just go back to the
[36:43] seed chapter since we're talking about
[36:45] the seed of God and um find in here and
[36:52] recognize once again what the Lord has
[36:54] done for us where he's brought us from
[36:56] also identifying of the enemy although
[36:58] it's not going to be about the seat of
[37:00] Satan today uh we can also see in here
[37:03] how Satan is tried so diligently to
[37:07] completely Wipe Out the name of God uh
[37:10] he succeeded in so many ways amen so
[37:13] many places so many churches even so
[37:16] many
[37:17] denominations uh have succeeded even in
[37:20] their baptisms I read the other day
[37:22] about a church a Baptist Church I forgot
[37:25] where it was uh the state it was in but
[37:28] it was a Baptist Church the pastor was
[37:31] very happy and thankful they had
[37:33] baptized like aund over a hundred people
[37:37] at one time he said he never seen
[37:39] anything like that in his church and I
[37:41] know I thought well uh it's a Baptist
[37:44] Church so um I don't mean to be critical
[37:47] but he probably didn't baptize anybody
[37:50] he got a lot of people wet but if he
[37:53] recited titles over them they are not
[37:55] baptized
[37:57] if he baptized them immersing in water
[38:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:02] then scripturally they they are baptized
[38:05] amen and and and I'm not trying to to
[38:09] squelch any of that achievement of those
[38:12] people in their heart's desire to want
[38:14] to come and to be baptized and to make a
[38:17] move towards God that's wonderful amen
[38:20] but my thought is it's just that one
[38:22] other step that Satan managed to be able
[38:25] to accomplish along with Trinity and
[38:27] other things to squelch out the name of
[38:30] God Jesus Christ and by not baptizing in
[38:34] his name is one of the major things
[38:36] because that's one of the three
[38:38] ordinances left to us water baptism left
[38:41] to us is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[38:44] Christ and I thought that's one of those
[38:45] things that Satan has been able to
[38:47] accomplish in most of the Christian
[38:49] world is to blot blot out the name of
[38:52] Jesus I remember one time and I think I
[38:54] may have told you this many years ago
[38:56] but uh when I was in Florida uh some
[38:59] friends of a brother that came to church
[39:02] with us invited him to go to one of
[39:03] their uh uh church services it was
[39:06] special service on a night uh Anastasia
[39:09] Baptist Church if I may call their name
[39:12] and we went to that and he invited me
[39:14] and me and Sonia went and uh we went to
[39:17] this church service and of course uh
[39:19] we're sitting there praying and reading
[39:21] our Bibles that everybody's eating and
[39:24] drinking and walking around and talking
[39:26] and it it was like we were at a carnival
[39:28] or something it was a social event uh up
[39:31] till just a couple minutes before church
[39:33] was supposed to start I thought my this
[39:35] chaos is no wonder God talk about the
[39:38] holy spirit being timed not being in a
[39:40] place as uh not being welcome and
[39:43] everything else is going on and I
[39:45] thought my this this is not quite the
[39:48] atmosphere I'm used to when we come into
[39:51] a worship service and then uh during
[39:54] that entire service
[39:57] uh and I don't know why the Lord brought
[39:59] this particular attent to my attention
[40:02] but during that entire service there the
[40:05] name of Jesus Christ was not mentioned
[40:08] one time until the senior pastor came up
[40:13] and closed the service in prayer and at
[40:16] the very end of his prayer he said in
[40:18] Jesus name that's the only time through
[40:21] every song all the preaching every
[40:24] testimonies everything that was done
[40:26] Jesus Christ was not mentioned once
[40:29] until the very end when the older
[40:31] gentleman Statesman senior pastor closed
[40:35] his prayer in Jesus name only time and I
[40:38] think that's that's exactly what Satan
[40:40] was trying to do all through time was to
[40:43] blot out that seed blot out that name
[40:47] and he's tried to and in many ways he
[40:49] succeeded and in many places he
[40:52] succeeded but thank God there are those
[40:54] and there are those places and there are
[40:56] those people who have not allowed him to
[40:59] be able to blot that name out and I'm so
[41:02] thankful to say that I'm one of them I'm
[41:04] so glad that I can say I'm one of the
[41:06] few I'm glad that we're a part of that
[41:09] group that can say that if not for Jesus
[41:12] Christ where would any of us be we would
[41:15] all be headed to hell that name above
[41:18] every name all that you do in word or In
[41:22] Deed you do in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:25] praise the Lord that seed now let's go
[41:28] back let's go over to Genesis I think I
[41:30] turn Genesis
[41:32] 4 amen and start this out this seed that
[41:36] Satan was able to try to uh nullify
[41:41] through time but remember remember as
[41:44] the enemy comes in like a flood even in
[41:47] this situation where we're about to read
[41:49] amen came killing abble when the enemy
[41:51] comes in like a flood Jesus raises up a
[41:55] standard against right amen so even as
[41:59] Satan was able to use Cain to kill the
[42:03] seed of God
[42:05] Abra Abel God then Rose above that and
[42:10] brought forth a SE amen amen let's let's
[42:13] just read it here getting a little ahead
[42:15] of myself uh Genesis 4:1 and Adam knew
[42:18] Eve his wife and she conceived and bear
[42:22] Cain and said I have gotten a man from
[42:25] the Lord of course she had got the man
[42:28] from the Lord all life comes from God so
[42:31] even the life that comes into the most
[42:34] vile
[42:36] degradable human being that life comes
[42:39] from God right amen and in this case
[42:42] even though this cane came from serpent
[42:47] seed it still was life from God has to
[42:51] be because Satan can't create and life
[42:54] is a creation amen so it has to come
[42:57] from God said I have gotten a man from
[43:00] the Lord and she again bear his brother
[43:02] Abel now one act two children amen
[43:08] one a tiller of the ground one a keeper
[43:11] of the sheep one the seed of Satan won
[43:14] the seed of God and again she bear his
[43:16] brother Abel and Abel was The Keeper of
[43:19] the sheep but Cain was the tiller of the
[43:20] ground and in process of time it came to
[43:23] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[43:25] the ground an offering unto the Lord and
[43:27] Abel he also brought of the firstlings
[43:29] of his flock and of the F thereof the
[43:31] Lord had respect unto Abel his offering
[43:34] but un Cain into his offering he had not
[43:36] respect and Cain was very wroth in his
[43:39] countenance fell now I want you to
[43:42] understand so many times we justify so
[43:44] many things in our lives and and I do it
[43:47] as well and understanding that we are
[43:50] humans uh we have human emotion but I
[43:54] want you to see the first first time in
[43:57] the history of humanity recorded by the
[43:59] Bible that we know that a
[44:02] human um a human individual became angry
[44:07] it was from the seed of the
[44:10] serpent
[44:11] amen again I we all have emotion we all
[44:16] get frustrated angry uh including myself
[44:19] but notice the first time that emotion
[44:23] recorded that we can see the first time
[44:25] that emotion
[44:26] was brought out because that's what WTH
[44:29] means WTH means anger seething with
[44:33] anger Cain was sething with anger when
[44:37] God rejected his AC his sacrifice amen
[44:41] and his countenance fell the first time
[44:43] it ever was projected from a human was
[44:47] from the seed of the serpent not the
[44:48] seed of God Amen praise the Lord look
[44:52] now I'm not saying I'm not saying you
[44:54] can't you can't have some anger some
[44:57] emotion that that's natural but when it
[45:00] becomes to the place that it's prevalent
[45:02] like that then there's there's there's
[45:04] there's probably some praying we need to
[45:06] be doing amen because that kind of anger
[45:09] should not come from us amen especially
[45:12] things that seem seemingly uh fairly
[45:17] insignificant because again like we said
[45:19] last week when you get down to the
[45:20] bottom line of it this whole life is
[45:22] just a vapor and all this stuff is
[45:24] bringing us to the place that we're just
[45:26] going home uh we're going in a Rapture
[45:29] to go home and that's all that matters
[45:32] uh all this stuff around us can be
[45:34] frustrating it can be difficult it can
[45:36] be uh infuriating it can bring all kinds
[45:40] of emotion but but but someone born
[45:43] again with the spirit of God should not
[45:45] get to the place that becomes so angry
[45:48] over some of these things that really
[45:49] are fairly
[45:50] insignificant and and God helped me uh
[45:54] not to get to that place
[45:56] sometimes it's hard not to but notice
[45:59] now again the first time it was ever
[46:02] exhibited from a human was from the seed
[46:04] of Satan not the seed of God so the Lord
[46:07] help us amen God's got everything under
[46:10] control God's taking care of everything
[46:12] even sometimes when we mess it up even
[46:15] when we do it wrong even when we make
[46:17] the mistake God still will make it right
[46:20] amen just like this as we were talking
[46:23] about but unto K he is right he is
[46:25] countenance fell he became very angry
[46:27] seething with anger and the Lord said
[46:30] unto Cain why are thou angry why are
[46:32] thou wroth why is th count it's Fallen
[46:34] if thou doest well Thou shalt shalt thou
[46:37] not be accepted and if thou doest not
[46:40] well sin lith at the door and unto thee
[46:43] shall be his desire and thou shalt rule
[46:45] over him and we know here just after
[46:47] that he rises up and his anger against
[46:50] his brother because he's still angry uh
[46:53] about uh God refusing
[46:56] uh his sacrifice but it doesn't account
[46:59] to us that his anger was leashed out on
[47:02] God his anger was leashed out on the
[47:04] closest thing that he could come to his
[47:06] twin brother
[47:09] Abel and he leashed he lashed out his
[47:12] anger on his brother and he killed his
[47:14] brother that anger got him so to the
[47:18] place that he was willing to kill murder
[47:22] his brother amen that's uh that's what
[47:26] develops from that from that seed from
[47:30] that life uh from that anger is is and
[47:35] then Jesus multiplied that Jesus
[47:37] magnified and said if you hate your
[47:40] brother without a cause amen you're
[47:42] guilty of murder so God help us to be
[47:45] able to keep this to a place where we
[47:48] don't get to the place that came got
[47:50] where his wroth uh is he he became in
[47:53] such an Ang state of Ang anger that he
[47:56] had to take his anger out on somebody it
[47:59] makes me wonder today about this
[48:01] wonderful American country that we live
[48:04] in today that we value human life so
[48:07] much yeah you look around the world and
[48:09] you see uh the the war in Israel even
[48:12] and Hamas and and these people they
[48:15] don't seem to care about life right
[48:17] they'll put citizens in front of them to
[48:19] protect them they don't care if the
[48:20] citizen dies they just try to keep
[48:22] themselves they strap bombs around
[48:24] children and these things and and it's
[48:27] horrible to think that they that they
[48:29] they devalue human life so much that
[48:32] they're willing for this for this
[48:34] effectless cause to to murder women and
[48:37] children and babies and not and and
[48:40] don't care anything about it but yet we
[48:44] uh will give billions of dollars because
[48:46] of One Life we'll turn over all kinds of
[48:50] uh uh criminals just to help save one
[48:53] American life because we're a great
[48:56] moral country that cares so much about
[48:59] human life that we'd give all this that
[49:01] we could just to try to help save one
[49:04] American life and yet we turn around and
[49:07] we murder unborn children by the
[49:10] millions and think what kind of a
[49:12] country is that how moral can you be
[49:16] when you when you've got this and it
[49:18] makes you wonder I mean people people
[49:23] don't seem to care that the country's
[49:26] falling apart as long as they have the
[49:29] right the legal right to murder their
[49:31] unborn children they don't care the the
[49:35] economy can be falling apart our enemies
[49:37] can be flooding over our country people
[49:40] can be coming here ready to want to
[49:41] destroy us destroy our building destroy
[49:44] our country murder Our Lives as long as
[49:47] we cannot as long as we can murder our
[49:49] unborn children they don't care about
[49:51] any of that that's all that's all some
[49:53] people care about you see it on the news
[49:56] all the time oh this great uh ability to
[50:00] be able to abort the children well
[50:02] abortion is just a fancy word for
[50:04] murder as long as they're able to do
[50:06] that that's all they care about I don't
[50:09] care if they don't have food on the
[50:10] table I don't care if the streets are
[50:13] littered with with trash and
[50:16] unfortunately uh homeless people and
[50:19] they don't they don't care if the crime
[50:20] is going crazy they don't care if the if
[50:24] our country is being flooded with people
[50:26] that want to kill us any second they get
[50:28] they don't care about all that they
[50:30] don't care if they lose their jobs as
[50:32] long as they can murder their unb born
[50:34] children what a wonder what a moral
[50:37] country we are we care about life so
[50:39] much it's a
[50:41] disgrace but it makes you wonder if
[50:44] anger is the thing that caused the first
[50:46] murder in human Humanity that we know of
[50:50] what is it today that is in people that
[50:53] want to have the right so they call
[50:56] right to murder an unborn child I don't
[51:01] understand does it come from that does
[51:04] it come just from a deep-seated anger
[51:06] maybe they're just obviously I can't
[51:09] believe they're born again uh you
[51:11] wouldn't do that it makes you wonder
[51:13] though if the very first murder comes
[51:16] here from anger what is all this other
[51:20] how does it precipitate it's obviously
[51:22] not from the seed of God it's got to be
[51:24] coming from a different place and I
[51:27] speak with it I guess of such passion
[51:29] because it just rips me apart to think
[51:31] about it it just kills me to think about
[51:34] this that that that we we claim to be a
[51:37] Christian Nation we claim to be so moral
[51:40] we claim to be
[51:42] someone a people a nation that cares so
[51:45] much and values life so much oh there
[51:48] that up there today oh just you you know
[51:52] make sure that we that we don't hurt
[51:54] anymore more civilians and I'm in favor
[51:56] of that I don't want anybody to get hurt
[51:58] or killed
[52:00] right but the circumstances don't
[52:03] dictate to that
[52:06] yeah it it just it just it makes it
[52:10] tough for me to to to understand but I
[52:14] do because we are living in Satan's
[52:17] Eden it makes me sad that so many people
[52:20] have so much anger in them that that
[52:24] they would care about the
[52:27] regular parts of living and life such as
[52:32] food and safety and and and prosperity
[52:36] just the normal things of life just for
[52:39] the ability to be able to murder a
[52:42] little baby I I it just I it it goes
[52:45] beyond me but all it what it does and
[52:48] I'll tell you to me this week uh maybe
[52:51] even longer maybe a couple weeks ago
[52:53] came to me that it just just this is the
[52:56] seed part the beginning to understand
[53:00] this has got to be where it comes from
[53:03] it can't come from God the ability to be
[53:06] able to murder legally your unborn
[53:09] children can't come from God if life is
[53:13] that precious how could that come from
[53:16] God God even gave pain God loves life so
[53:21] much he even gave Cain the ability to
[53:24] repent can't if he would but he
[53:28] wouldn't God said if you'll do well I'll
[53:31] accept
[53:32] you I mean is there any Greater Grace
[53:35] than God's extending his hand to the
[53:37] seed of Satan right amen there is none
[53:43] but yet he was willing to do it of
[53:45] course the man didn't Kain didn't have
[53:46] it in him to do that right but we see
[53:50] there where that come from where it
[53:53] precipitates it's coming now still
[53:56] continuing falling forward see God let's
[54:00] just let's continue on now
[54:02] God God planted his seed in the
[54:06] garden first God got to the Garden first
[54:09] it was God's Garden God got to the
[54:12] Garden first God placed his seed in the
[54:15] Garden of Eden Adam and he told Adam
[54:18] what to do he brought Adam to life put
[54:20] him in a human body and he gave him a
[54:23] helpmate he told what God told Adam what
[54:25] to do take care of it he loved his seed
[54:29] so much he come down there every day and
[54:33] talked to him and fellowship with him
[54:35] walk with him talk with him lifp to ear
[54:38] and enjoyed the time together with his
[54:41] seed but
[54:43] unfortunately Satan was the first one to
[54:46] get to eat and plant his seed in Eve
[54:50] before Adam could and the results of
[54:53] that brought forth a came brought forth
[54:56] that life brought forth that
[54:59] seed now look let me let me read this
[55:01] real
[55:10] quick look at this God of this evil age
[55:14] notice it's noteworthy to notice at the
[55:16] beginning Seth and his children never
[55:19] went the scientific
[55:21] way at the beginning Seth and his
[55:24] children ever went the scientific way
[55:26] you know what let me let me read this
[55:28] other two first let me read these other
[55:30] two verses of scripture still in Genesis
[55:33] 4 25 and 26 now let's read that real
[55:37] quick and Adam knew his wife
[55:40] again and she bear a son and called his
[55:43] name Seth for God said uh for God she uh
[55:49] said she had appointed me another seed
[55:52] instead of Abel whom Cain slew
[55:55] and Seth to him also there was born a
[55:58] son son to said now we're continuing on
[56:03] with the lineage of God with God's seed
[56:06] not this not the seed of Satan not the
[56:09] seed of the serpent but God's seed God's
[56:12] seed through Adam came forth in a
[56:15] set and Who was appointed remember when
[56:19] the enemy comes in like a flood which he
[56:21] did which Cain killed Abel and the enemy
[56:25] comes in like flood God raises the
[56:27] standard against it and brings forth
[56:30] through the pro procreation of Adam and
[56:32] Eve a a a man appointed in the place of
[56:36] Abel
[56:37] set in the lineage of God the seed of
[56:42] God Seth comes forth and Seth now has a
[56:47] child born to him and to said to him
[56:50] also there was born a son and he called
[56:52] his name Enos this then praise the Lord
[56:57] then
[56:59] men then began men to call upon the name
[57:02] of the
[57:03] Lord Enos at this point now men begin to
[57:09] call upon the name of the Lord when
[57:11] through the lineage of Adam through the
[57:14] seed of God men then become to call
[57:18] about upon the name of the Lord not Cain
[57:21] Cain was the T of the ground Cain was
[57:23] the man of science Cain was a man of
[57:25] Education Cain was a man of medicine
[57:28] Cain was a man of uh of all the worldly
[57:31] inventions and all the things that
[57:33] people have come to completely rely upon
[57:35] today instead of God that was Cain's
[57:38] lineage Satan's was sess was let's call
[57:42] on God Enos came forth and called on God
[57:47] and believed in God whatever we have
[57:49] need of we can get from the Lord Jesus
[57:52] amen we can get from God praise the lord
[57:55] we we believe that now look notice now
[57:59] brother Ram said again this is God of
[58:01] the evil age notice this noteworthy to
[58:03] notice at the beginning Seth and his
[58:06] children never went the scientific way
[58:10] amen why they were calling on God not on
[58:14] man see Saints God God never intended
[58:19] man to live by science right God never
[58:22] intended man to live by education and
[58:25] medicine and advancements of Education
[58:28] he intended man to live completely
[58:31] solely totally on faith right faith in
[58:35] him that's what we're built to do that's
[58:38] what our our our our soul is in there to
[58:41] bring forth into our spirit to to have
[58:44] faith to believe in the Lord God to live
[58:48] by faith and I believe that's what we do
[58:51] in living by faith yes we have the
[58:53] conveniences a lot of times of
[58:55] scientific discoveries medical
[58:58] advancements and all those things but we
[59:00] live by faith amen we live by faith it's
[59:04] like brother random said you break your
[59:06] leg a doctor medicine can go and set it
[59:09] but it takes God to bring the healing
[59:11] yeah amen God is the one that brings the
[59:14] healing praise the Lord so we still live
[59:17] by faith now look at the beginning God
[59:20] God always intended us always intended
[59:23] man to live by faith he only he always
[59:26] wanted us wants us even today to trust
[59:29] in him to believe in him to have faith
[59:33] in him amen praise the Lord I think I
[59:37] told you the other day I I mentioned I
[59:39] remember last Sunday but I mentioned
[59:42] day medical
[59:45] advancements
[59:47] sometimes it becomes a hindrance to
[59:49] humanity yeah uh I I can't remember I
[59:53] talked about this I think I think with
[59:55] uh with uh a guy at work I try to bring
[59:59] up the Lord anytime I can but uh at work
[1:00:02] and
[1:00:03] thinking and I mentioned because a story
[1:00:07] that he told me but I think I mentioned
[1:00:08] it here medical advancements just come
[1:00:10] to the place sometimes it become a
[1:00:12] hindrance to
[1:00:13] humanity uh we've gotten so smart and
[1:00:17] we've become so
[1:00:19] educated uh that sometimes we that you
[1:00:23] all this starts
[1:00:25] nullifying the will of
[1:00:27] God uh it comes to a place and time that
[1:00:32] we work and we try and we fight and we
[1:00:35] struggle so hard for life which we
[1:00:38] should and it's in us it's inherit in
[1:00:40] human to
[1:00:43] live with all the things and you see so
[1:00:45] many people and I hear of it more and
[1:00:47] more all the time
[1:00:51] uh medicine was able to save this person
[1:00:54] 's life but now
[1:00:57] they're they they don't don't do
[1:01:00] anything they're they're
[1:01:03] there I hate to say it make it I can't
[1:01:07] think of a way to say it without not
[1:01:09] sounding wrong but they become of no
[1:01:11] value to the world to life anymore and
[1:01:15] you think what was the point just let
[1:01:18] them go yeah sometimes say sometimes as
[1:01:22] much as we hate it it just comes our
[1:01:24] time to go yes and we should go and
[1:01:29] people scared about Co Saints when it
[1:01:33] comes our time to go don't care what it
[1:01:35] is if it's our time to go and God's
[1:01:37] calling us home it's time to go we just
[1:01:39] need to go sometime that's just it's
[1:01:42] just God's way we trust and live by
[1:01:46] faith uh I I we had people that was in
[1:01:50] our church for a while in Florida and
[1:01:52] they tried and tried and tried and tried
[1:01:54] they couldn't have children and they
[1:01:56] just come and I talked to him about it
[1:01:58] he said you know we just put it in the
[1:01:59] hands of the Lord Brother if it's the
[1:02:02] Lord's will we're not going to do
[1:02:03] anything to cause it we're not going to
[1:02:05] do anything to stop it uh if it's the
[1:02:08] Lord's will it'll happen if it's not it
[1:02:10] won't no invitro no petri dish babies
[1:02:15] none of this it just if this is the will
[1:02:18] of God it's going to happen if it's not
[1:02:20] the will of God it's not going to happen
[1:02:22] that's just how we believe it and I know
[1:02:25] people say when they adopted a child or
[1:02:27] something the mother relaxes or whatever
[1:02:29] that means to cause her to conceive
[1:02:32] whatever however that works I don't know
[1:02:35] I just know that we live by faith and we
[1:02:37] trust in God and if God's not going to
[1:02:40] open that door I'm not going to bust it
[1:02:43] down Lord help me I try not to anyway if
[1:02:47] the Lord's not going to open that door
[1:02:49] I'm not going to knock it open I I it's
[1:02:52] just going to stay closed for whatever
[1:02:54] reason reason and say lord it's up to
[1:02:56] you I prayed and I prayed and I sang and
[1:02:59] prayed and trust God and cried and
[1:03:01] prayed that the Lord would spare our
[1:03:03] first son that he wouldn't die but that
[1:03:07] wasn't God's will right and it comes to
[1:03:10] a place you say Lord not my will but
[1:03:12] thine be
[1:03:13] done see it's time to go it's time to
[1:03:16] go that's the bottom line we become so
[1:03:20] dependent on all uh uh uh uh on on
[1:03:24] almost selfishly sometimes amen uh that
[1:03:28] we forget about the will of the Lord
[1:03:30] what is God's will well I want a baby so
[1:03:33] bad that's I understand that especially
[1:03:36] someone a female has in them to be a
[1:03:38] mother I I understand absolutely I do
[1:03:43] but sometimes there's a reason why God
[1:03:46] does things or doesn't do things and we
[1:03:49] should just trust him and believe him
[1:03:51] for whatever that reason is and whatever
[1:03:55] it is praise the Lord let it be my
[1:03:57] sister never could have children and she
[1:03:59] never did they never went to try
[1:04:02] anything but she said whatever the will
[1:04:04] of the Lord is and then of course our
[1:04:07] children kind of become her children
[1:04:08] there till she passed away but uh she
[1:04:12] just never could but she didn't when the
[1:04:15] door was closed she didn't try to bust
[1:04:17] it open make something happen just
[1:04:20] always there's a reason God whatever
[1:04:23] reason it is Lord I'm here and you show
[1:04:27] me what whatever your purpose the all
[1:04:30] the science and medicine and education
[1:04:32] and advancements and and technology and
[1:04:35] all these things friend
[1:04:38] sometimes it just becomes a hindrance to
[1:04:41] us a hindrance to humanity yeah look now
[1:04:45] let me continue with Seth though look
[1:04:47] God's
[1:04:49] way Seth and his children never went
[1:04:52] that way never went the the scientific
[1:04:55] way and I'm not saying a person who's a
[1:04:58] scientist can't be a scientist I'm not
[1:05:00] saying a person who a doctor or nurse
[1:05:02] can't be a doctor n I'm not saying if
[1:05:05] God's called you to be a teacher be the
[1:05:07] best teacher and educate that child and
[1:05:09] the bet that you C that you can be I'm
[1:05:12] not saying there not to do that but we
[1:05:15] as Believers as the seed of God don't
[1:05:18] rely upon that that's not our life
[1:05:21] that's not our meat that's not what we
[1:05:23] live on we trust and believe and live by
[1:05:26] faith in
[1:05:27] God Seth his children never went the
[1:05:30] scientific way now we're going to talk
[1:05:33] about science for a few minutes if I say
[1:05:36] this not excusing my ignorance but a
[1:05:37] bunch of ignoramuses anything they'll
[1:05:39] deny anything that'll deny the word of
[1:05:42] God
[1:05:43] sure um it's noteworthy watch it say
[1:05:48] children never went the scientific route
[1:05:51] they were humble herdsmen farmers and so
[1:05:54] forth but Cain's children did why
[1:05:59] inspired by their daddy the devil Cain
[1:06:02] inspired by his daddy the devil watch
[1:06:05] the seat of God now let's get to this
[1:06:08] the seat of God watch the seat of God
[1:06:11] coming down through every age and watch
[1:06:13] where it's heading up today Christians
[1:06:17] genuine Christians are not all about
[1:06:20] scientific research and stuff no just to
[1:06:24] he said we'll get to that he said but
[1:06:25] Cain did Cain
[1:06:28] did I I'm helping you see where these
[1:06:32] things came from to where they've
[1:06:36] gotten in
[1:06:38] in this the in kain's lineage and in
[1:06:42] God's lineage the seed of God the seed
[1:06:44] of The Serpent and the seed of God he
[1:06:47] said watch but Cain did after the nature
[1:06:50] of his father devil full of worldly
[1:06:52] knowledge Beauty science so forth Cain's
[1:06:56] children was scientific they were
[1:06:59] educated they were players of music
[1:07:01] instruments of modern Elvis Presley and
[1:07:03] some of this stuff uh like that school
[1:07:06] board let happened up here uh the other
[1:07:08] day Builders of cities beautifying women
[1:07:11] for personal lust that's the devil
[1:07:15] giving them women paint bobbing hair and
[1:07:18] shorts and things like that of their own
[1:07:21] dirty lust where did that come from it
[1:07:23] didn't come from the seat of God right
[1:07:25] now there's nothing wrong with a woman
[1:07:27] wanting to be beautiful it's in her to
[1:07:28] want to be that way Amen to do something
[1:07:31] that would try to help but when it
[1:07:33] becomes to the place that it becomes so
[1:07:35] unnatural and and so ungodly looking and
[1:07:38] and all that that's all those things has
[1:07:42] come from the devil amen the vanity the
[1:07:45] vanity that follows along with it Saints
[1:07:48] I mean I talk about vanity when I got
[1:07:51] out of shower this morning I I comb my
[1:07:53] head hair I I got it to where I like it
[1:07:56] and I sprayed it a little bit with
[1:08:00] hairspray

[1:08:04] best I could I come to church this
[1:08:06] morning there's nothing wrong with that

[1:08:09] wanted to look the best I could just
[1:08:11] shaved my face I brushed my teeth
[1:08:13] because I want to look the best I could
[1:08:15] this morning amen there's nothing wrong
[1:08:17] with that amen there's nothing wrong
[1:08:20] with the gel of my hair there's nothing
[1:08:21] wrong with the hairspray or or the the
[1:08:24] uh smell good stuff on my face there's
[1:08:26] nothing wrong with that that's not what
[1:08:28] we're talking about but when it comes to
[1:08:30] the places you see these especially oh

[1:10:03] far it can get uh uh a natural beauty is
[1:10:07] the most beautiful thing you could no
[1:10:11] matter what it is
[1:10:14] uh like I said I'm not the best singer
[1:10:17] in the world but I love to sing and I'm
[1:10:18] going to sing with what God gave me and
[1:10:20] whether you like it or not I'm sorry
[1:10:22] amen uh that's just the way it is you
[1:10:26] know not here to please you anyway but
[1:10:29] that all that that that brother B was
[1:10:31] talking about that that's not the seat
[1:10:33] of God that that's the seat of the devil
[1:10:37] that's that's the seat of getting to uh
[1:10:40] uh to elicit the wrong type of emotion
[1:10:44] out of a person such as the anger or the
[1:10:48] lust those things it's to it's to elicit
[1:10:51] those things out of the human emotion
[1:10:53] that's a part part of human emotion but
[1:10:55] things that we're supposed to is as we
[1:10:57] are Christians that we have
[1:10:59] overcome that we have uh gotten beyond
[1:11:03] that the Lord has blessed us with amen
[1:11:05] and that's his life his spirit because
[1:11:08] we are the seed of God seed a
[1:11:12] Seth Seth was the correct seed amen SE
[1:11:16] Seth was the correct seed to continue in
[1:11:20] the lineage of the seed of
[1:11:22] God he was that one he continued it as
[1:11:27] Eve said here in the place of Abel Satan
[1:11:30] came in like a flood but then that seed
[1:11:32] continued on he tried to squelch it out
[1:11:35] and get rid of it he only wanted Satan
[1:11:37] only wanted his seed to dominate and to
[1:11:40] come forth but God had a greater plan
[1:11:43] that regardless of what the devil tries
[1:11:45] to do everything he does
[1:11:48] God Rockets past him over him Rises up a
[1:11:52] standard against it he brought forth the
[1:11:55] Seth and Seth was that man that correct
[1:11:58] seed the seed of God that continued in
[1:12:00] that lineage to keep that lineage going
[1:12:03] amen God had continued it uh uh
[1:12:07] had intended it to be that way that's
[1:12:10] the way God had always intended it to be
[1:12:13] there never was to be a
[1:12:17] procreation babies coming forth in that
[1:12:20] manner wasn't to be that was
[1:12:24] that was a delving or a devolving into
[1:12:27] the seat of Satan amen not the seat of
[1:12:29] God the seat of God's come forth and
[1:12:33] brought us into this day now I want to
[1:12:35] talk about for some
[1:12:37] reason the Lord keeps taking me back to
[1:12:39] this so I I don't know I hope you don't
[1:12:41] get bored of this but let's go back to
[1:12:43] First
[1:12:45] John there's been three or four other
[1:12:47] services that the Lord keeps bringing me
[1:12:49] back to this to this uh scripture
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:57] and very possibly the next one after
[1:13:00] this 1 John chapter 3 9 and 10 we all
[1:13:04] know it very
[1:13:05] well about the seed of
[1:13:09] God
[1:13:12] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:13:15] sin for his
[1:13:16] seed the seed of
[1:13:19] God for his seed remaineth in him now
[1:13:23] I've said before and I've told you all
[1:13:25] you know the word remaineth means it was
[1:13:28] there and stayed right it never just
[1:13:30] came right then it was always there and
[1:13:34] it stayed there that's what remain means
[1:13:37] amen the seed for his seed remaineth in
[1:13:41] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[1:13:46] of God born of God of God what of God
[1:13:50] God's seed born of God God's seed no not
[1:13:54] a physical seed but a spiritual seed I
[1:13:58] might not be able to track my lenience
[1:14:00] in fact I know I can track my lenience
[1:14:03] back to Seth if you will or to Adam I
[1:14:05] guess we could Adam but we can't TR
[1:14:08] Trace our lineage uh physically but we
[1:14:12] can spiritually yes we can track our
[1:14:15] lineage spiritually and know that that
[1:14:18] seed of God that is in US is the
[1:14:20] spiritual seed of God that that we were
[1:14:22] born naturally was of a natural seed but
[1:14:25] that is born of spiritually is a spirit
[1:14:29] a spiritual seed that spiritual seed is
[1:14:32] the seed of God that remains in him
[1:14:34] because of a new
[1:14:36] birth because we're born of God then
[1:14:39] when we receive that new birth we are
[1:14:41] born of God of God's seed not the seed
[1:14:45] of Satan not the seed of the serpent but
[1:14:47] the seed of God now God's seed is in you
[1:14:51] in this in this T ver Earth the children
[1:14:54] of God are
[1:14:55] manifest praise God they're manifest how
[1:14:58] they are brought to light how they are
[1:15:00] uncovered how because now they are
[1:15:02] living with the seed of God in them and
[1:15:05] the seed of God is replicating itself
[1:15:07] through them they are they are becoming
[1:15:11] as through that
[1:15:13] seed as God the seed of God the seed of
[1:15:17] God that bring forth God that seed of
[1:15:20] God in us brings forth the likeness of
[1:15:22] God
[1:15:23] the likeness of God in us in us now in
[1:15:28] the children now the children of God are
[1:15:32] manifest where did the manifestation
[1:15:35] come from it came from the seed amen
[1:15:38] what comes on the outside had to begin
[1:15:41] on the inside
[1:15:43] amen let's just go back to anger for a
[1:15:46] minute if we get angry on the outside
[1:15:48] the anger started inside from an emotion
[1:15:51] didn't start on the outside start on the
[1:15:54] inside you saw something heard something
[1:15:56] felt something on your five senses that
[1:15:59] reached into your spirit and your spirit
[1:16:02] responded with anger from the inside
[1:16:05] amen the seed of God the manifestation
[1:16:08] of God didn't start on the outside which
[1:16:10] a lot of people try to do fix themselves
[1:16:13] up dress themselves up uh make it all
[1:16:16] look uh holy and proper and message like
[1:16:21] if you will but they try to do on the
[1:16:23] outside that's not where it begins it
[1:16:26] must begin on the inside with the new
[1:16:28] birth the new birth then brings forth a
[1:16:31] manifestation of the sons of God that is
[1:16:34] that is the seed of God can't start on
[1:16:37] the outside got to start on the inside
[1:16:39] if it starts on the outside it's put on
[1:16:41] it's fake it's made up it won't last
[1:16:45] amen but if it's the seed of God and
[1:16:47] it's down in you and it's your birth and
[1:16:49] it's who you become you cannot deny it
[1:16:52] nor could you ever get away from it amen
[1:16:55] I believe that's why the Bible says to
[1:16:57] train a child in the way they should go
[1:16:58] and when they get older they it won't
[1:17:00] depart from them can't amen because it
[1:17:03] becomes a part of who they are praise
[1:17:05] the Lord see and in this the children of
[1:17:08] God are manifested now the children of
[1:17:10] God on this Earth manifest and the
[1:17:13] children of the devil whosoever do not
[1:17:15] righteousness is not of God neither he
[1:17:19] that loveth not his
[1:17:21] brother now the seed of God
[1:17:23] is Manifest and brings forth life it
[1:17:27] brings forth the manifestation of who
[1:17:29] God is and that germ seed of God is what
[1:17:32] is
[1:17:33] eternal amen The Germ seed of God that
[1:17:35] is in us now is what is eternal praise
[1:17:38] the Lord I'm not Eternal right but that
[1:17:41] seed is and just thank God that I am of
[1:17:45] that seed praise the Lord so which makes
[1:17:49] me eternal I know it sounds crazy but I
[1:17:52] am not Eternal but that germ seed is but
[1:17:55] that germ seed has become me which makes
[1:17:57] me
[1:17:59] eternal praise the Lord it sounds like a
[1:18:03] a roundabout but it's the truth it just
[1:18:05] proves that it's not about me anyway
[1:18:08] it's not of my abilities there's nothing
[1:18:10] I could do it's nothing I could say
[1:18:11] nothing I could produce is from God I
[1:18:14] just accept it and believe it that's why
[1:18:16] we must live by faith we must live by
[1:18:20] faith because faith is the six sense am
[1:18:23] it's a six sense it has nothing to do
[1:18:24] with the five senses of the of the body
[1:18:27] has nothing to do with the five sens of
[1:18:28] the spirit has everything to do with
[1:18:30] that six sentus in there that came from
[1:18:33] God that is Faith it shows it rises
[1:18:36] above everything else it produces a God
[1:18:40] because it is from God right it becomes
[1:18:43] who you are amen that Faith seed that
[1:18:46] rises above all this when the enemy
[1:18:49] comes in like a flood God raises a
[1:18:51] standard against it
[1:18:54] praise the Lord remember when brother
[1:18:55] green uh gave us that testimony when he
[1:18:58] went hunting with brother brandom and
[1:19:01] brother brother Perry told him said uh
[1:19:04] you know I had this issue brother Brown
[1:19:05] brother Brown says I'll talk to you
[1:19:07] about it later and they go on and on and
[1:19:10] on and brother green gets the place he
[1:19:11] about thinks that brother brand forgot
[1:19:13] about it and brother brandom's laying on
[1:19:15] the couch sitting there and brother prry
[1:19:17] brother green comes through and uh and
[1:19:20] and doing whatever and brother brand
[1:19:22] says now about your problem come sit
[1:19:24] down here the come sit down on the couch
[1:19:26] now about your problem Oh My how would
[1:19:30] you feel at that time I imagine brother
[1:19:33] Green's face was flush about your
[1:19:36] problem Oh my um well it's like this oh
[1:19:40] I know what your problem
[1:19:42] is and there was no it's like brother
[1:19:45] green said it was no oh you're kidding
[1:19:47] me oh I can't be oh you don't really
[1:19:49] know oh you're just putting me on oh he
[1:19:52] knew he knew knew brother BR said I know
[1:19:54] he knew he knew there was no question
[1:19:56] about it now about your problem he said
[1:19:59] you got to do like I
[1:20:02] do wow because he was talking about his
[1:20:05] lustful imaginations that's brother
[1:20:07] Green's testimony I'm not saying
[1:20:08] anything he didn't say on tape his
[1:20:11] lustful imagination he said now you got
[1:20:13] to do what I do lustful imaginations
[1:20:16] brother brand really you got to do what
[1:20:18] I do amen as soon as you get a hold of
[1:20:21] yourself and you can come to yourself
[1:20:23] say God forgive me I you know I'm not
[1:20:26] like that I don't mean to act like Lord
[1:20:28] help me and come to yourself and get
[1:20:30] over that repent and move on but see the
[1:20:33] the devil will take that and put such
[1:20:35] condemnation on people and that's just a
[1:20:38] small incident of one person's testimony
[1:20:41] we all have different things in life
[1:20:43] obviously get a hold of yourself he said
[1:20:45] brother R said as soon as you can get a
[1:20:48] hold of yourself shake off of that and
[1:20:51] come to yourself say Lord forgive for
[1:20:52] give me and that's why he put brother BR
[1:20:54] put that cross in his car amen he's him
[1:20:57] and brother Green Downtown tucon
[1:21:00] beautiful Mexican woman goes across the
[1:21:02] street and brother green said brother
[1:21:04] Brown followed her every step of the way
[1:21:06] and watched her the entire way and he
[1:21:08] came to himself and he looked and said
[1:21:11] brother green said that's what we need
[1:21:12] to guard ourselves from amen that's why
[1:21:15] he put a cross in his carar have
[1:21:17] Crossing car all brother Patty's got a
[1:21:19] big Crossing and amen that look to look
[1:21:23] at the cross and not to all the other
[1:21:25] stuff amen amen to keep your mind off of
[1:21:28] that and keep it on Christ see as soon
[1:21:31] as you come to yourself that's where it
[1:21:33] brings to that place amen of
[1:21:36] understanding look let me read a couple
[1:21:38] of quotes
[1:21:39] here um we'll close here in just a
[1:21:42] minute why Christ speak
[1:21:45] Jeffersonville 1963 now then we see that
[1:21:49] he was born with this great gift and
[1:21:52] equality within him then it only take it
[1:21:55] only taken something to flash across
[1:21:58] that to bring that thing to life see the
[1:22:02] seat of God is actually placed listen
[1:22:05] now now this validify what I have said I
[1:22:09] don't know that I've read this quote but
[1:22:11] to understand I just bring it to
[1:22:14] understand we shouldn't need a quote
[1:22:17] like this to believe what the scripture
[1:22:19] says that when it says the seed
[1:22:21] remaineth
[1:22:23] that's plain and simple seed was there
[1:22:26] stayed
[1:22:27] there remained there but brother R said
[1:22:32] see the seed of God is actually placed
[1:22:35] in us from the foundation of the world
[1:22:39] now to me friend anybody else can say
[1:22:42] what they want to about it that settles
[1:22:45] it I didn't have a problem with it
[1:22:47] because that's what the scripture says
[1:22:49] but that settles it for me I don't have
[1:22:52] to say well but it makes more sense of
[1:22:54] blah blah blah no forget about that the
[1:22:57] sensibility has comes from the devil
[1:22:59] Think About by faith that seed was
[1:23:03] actually placed in you from the
[1:23:05] foundation of the world when you were
[1:23:07] predestined your name was placed in the
[1:23:09] Lamb's Book of Life that you belong to
[1:23:11] him I'm a Son of God a daughter of God I
[1:23:14] am one of them not because of what you
[1:23:17] said two weeks ago or two years ago but
[1:23:20] what happened before the foundation of
[1:23:22] the world right praise the Lord amen God
[1:23:25] put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:26] and now you are not your own you belong
[1:23:28] to him and that seed then was placed in
[1:23:31] you then because he purchased you he
[1:23:34] bought you belonged to him prise the
[1:23:35] Lord and when that light first strikes
[1:23:39] that seed it brings that seed to life
[1:23:43] but the light first had to come upon the
[1:23:46] seed the light the word amen had to come
[1:23:51] upon the seed the spirit of God like
[1:23:54] I've talked many times of the little
[1:23:57] woman at the well her in that
[1:24:00] condition ill- faint person her life was
[1:24:03] degraded she was in that condition
[1:24:05] because that Traditions had never
[1:24:07] touched
[1:24:08] her
[1:24:10] amen but but though when that light
[1:24:14] first struck her quickly she recognized
[1:24:18] it when Jesus came to her there was
[1:24:21] something already in there
[1:24:23] when Jesus came to her the light Struck
[1:24:25] it and immediately she said why Messiah
[1:24:30] we know when Messiah comes he's going to
[1:24:32] do these things I am he she runs and
[1:24:34] tells everybody amen ill fate woman runs
[1:24:37] to the city and tells them all come see
[1:24:40] who I found this is the Messiah she
[1:24:42] didn't care
[1:24:43] that so many people were against him or
[1:24:46] saying this or that or whatever about
[1:24:48] him she didn't care she said this is
[1:24:50] what I know is supposed to happen this
[1:24:52] is the man they came out there many of
[1:24:54] the city were saved because of her
[1:24:57] testimony praise the Lord the light
[1:25:00] struck her and she quickly recognized it
[1:25:03] there was a deep in there somewhere amen
[1:25:06] how simple does it get in that message
[1:25:08] that we have on video of the deep
[1:25:11] calling to the Deep right how much
[1:25:13] simpler does it get to understand when
[1:25:16] there was a call there had to be
[1:25:18] something there to respond to the call
[1:25:20] if there's nothing there to resp respond
[1:25:22] to it it could call all at once but
[1:25:25] there's nothing to respond to the call
[1:25:28] amen if your body says I'm hungry I need
[1:25:31] food and there's not a speck of food on
[1:25:34] the planet you're going to die because
[1:25:37] there's nothing to meet that uh uh uh
[1:25:40] that desire there's nothing there to
[1:25:43] meet that
[1:25:46] hunger if there's nothing there to start
[1:25:51] with which people will say as I've said
[1:25:54] many times I had a sister one time I
[1:25:57] said in North Carolina that fussed with
[1:25:59] me about it say sisters there's nothing
[1:26:02] there how can that deep
[1:26:06] respond if there's to a call if there's
[1:26:09] nothing there to respond right there has
[1:26:12] to be something there to call to reach
[1:26:15] out to that the boy in the sulfur the
[1:26:17] erasers the P the uh pedals on his bike
[1:26:20] the erasers off his pencil something in
[1:26:22] there crying for it if there's nothing
[1:26:25] there to respond what's good the
[1:26:28] call there's got to be something in
[1:26:30] there that responds to that call God's
[1:26:34] power to transform look 1965 notice here
[1:26:37] now again how perfect these church
[1:26:40] dipers are these Edens go through a seed
[1:26:43] of his word or excuse me God through a
[1:26:47] seed of his word and there is only one
[1:26:50] thing that can Quicken that word and
[1:26:52] that that is the spirit Quicken make
[1:26:55] alive praise the Lord the word and that
[1:26:58] is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to
[1:27:02] the word the spirit and when that life
[1:27:05] and that word meets in that life of the
[1:27:07] spirit it produces what the seed
[1:27:11] is praise the
[1:27:13] Lord that seed is the seed of God what
[1:27:16] does it produce it produces what the
[1:27:18] seed is of where did the seed come from
[1:27:21] we just read in first John that's where
[1:27:23] the seed comes from it's the seed of God
[1:27:25] it's not the seed of Newton it's not the
[1:27:26] seed of brother brandham it's the seed
[1:27:28] of God God placed it in there and
[1:27:31] there's got to be a response there's got
[1:27:33] to be something that calls out to that
[1:27:36] amen that seed of God the seed of God
[1:27:39] that was in Mary that seed that was in
[1:27:41] her was God was from God yeah that
[1:27:44] became Jesus Christ it was the seat of
[1:27:47] God in her that was placed
[1:27:48] supernaturally in her was the seat of
[1:27:51] God that produced Jesus Christ is the
[1:27:54] same seed amen amen mine praise the Lord
[1:27:59] I I I really just want to read one more
[1:28:01] scripture I got a couple more here but
[1:28:04] I'm going to try to finish up with
[1:28:08] this once let's go over to St John uh St
[1:28:13] John chapter 12
[1:28:14] once St John chapter
[1:28:17] 12
[1:28:19] once there was in one man Jesus Jesus
[1:28:22] Christ there was that life there was
[1:28:25] that
[1:28:26] seed Jesus Christ was that
[1:28:30] one the one that was produced out of the
[1:28:32] seed that was placed in
[1:28:36] Mary that produced Jesus Christ it was
[1:28:39] God the seed of God that was put in Mary
[1:28:42] was Jesus Christ amen that was it that
[1:28:46] was him he was the
[1:28:48] one how is it going to get from that one
[1:28:52] to the multitudes that there were

[1:29:43] saying the hour has come that the son of
[1:29:46] man uh should be glorified verily verily
[1:29:49] I say unto you except a corn of wheat
[1:29:52] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:29:56] alone it would have stayed him alone if

[1:30:01] just been him but the corn of wheat had
[1:30:05] to fall into the ground and die he's
[1:30:07] speaking of himself now amen he's

[1:30:38] told us it's got to go in the ground and
[1:30:41] die to bring forth
[1:30:43] multitudes because then from there he
[1:30:46] can not only just be the one here that's
[1:30:48] with them but he can spread himself out
[1:30:51] and drop his seed into anyone who will
[1:30:54] believe he did 120 of them on the day of
[1:30:57] of of Pentecost the upper room yeah amen

[1:31:38] trouble see he knows because he's
[1:31:40] talking about himself he knows he has to
[1:31:43] go to Calvary and suffer this death now
[1:31:46] my soul is troubled and what shall I say
[1:31:49] father save me from this hour
[1:31:53] but for this cause came I unto this hour
[1:31:57] the purpose that I'm here for in all of
[1:32:01] this the reason I'm here is to live that
[1:32:05] life and to shed my blood and to go and

[1:32:47] a voice from Heaven saying I have both
[1:32:50] glorified it and and will glorify it
[1:32:53] again

[1:33:06] heard was a rumble right because see
[1:33:08] look others said an angel spoke to him
[1:33:12] what did they hear amen because
[1:33:14] different people are going to hear
[1:33:15] different things yeah and depending on
[1:33:17] that person's stature with the Lord
[1:33:19] determines what they probably heard or
[1:33:21] didn't hear amen it's like Paul Paul
[1:33:25] heard something when he was on the horse
[1:33:26] on his road to Damascus he heard God
[1:33:29] speak to him the other around him just
[1:33:31] heard some kind of rumbling enough it
[1:33:33] just it Disturbed him they fell to their
[1:33:35] knees amen but they weren't privy to the
[1:33:38] information that that Paul heard from
[1:33:41] God or Saul heard from God
[1:33:46] Amen heard it thundered other said an
[1:33:49] angel spoke to him Jesus answered and
[1:33:52] said this voice came not because of me
[1:33:55] but for your sakes Hallelujah now it's
[1:33:59] sounds very familiar doesn't it amen
[1:34:02] like just exactly what brother Brandon
[1:34:05] said amen he even talked about that the
[1:34:08] gift of God this gift is not for me it's
[1:34:10] for you Lord sent it to be used for
[1:34:14] you just
[1:34:16] like just like at the
[1:34:18] wreck when when they had the wreck Billy
[1:34:21] Paul turned around and came back and saw
[1:34:23] the car in such a a wreck brother brand
[1:34:26] halfway through the windshield his
[1:34:28] mother laying on the floorboard dead or
[1:34:30] stepmother laying on the floorboard dead

[1:34:42] dead he said take my arm and lay it over
[1:34:44] on her take his arm all twisted out and
[1:34:47] put it over on her and she comes back to
[1:34:49] life he goes back back around he looks
[1:34:52] at it this this his testimony he said
[1:34:54] dad all you have to do is speak the word
[1:34:56] and you'll come right out of that and he
[1:34:58] said his dad just turned his
[1:35:00] head amen what was it he
[1:35:04] knew he
[1:35:06] knew it wasn't for him it was for us the
[1:35:11] Lord blessed him obviously the Lord
[1:35:12] healed him the Lord took care of him all
[1:35:14] these things but that gift he said was
[1:35:16] for the people right he said when he
[1:35:18] said you just just say the word he just
[1:35:21] turn turned his head cuz what was it
[1:35:23] time was it yeah that was it but now it
[1:35:27] brought mey back to life amen Sarah was
[1:35:30] turned out okay in the back but that's
[1:35:32] all it took see it was that time he just
[1:35:36] turned his
[1:35:38] head he said now
[1:35:41] look this voice was not for me it was
[1:35:43] but it was for you now is the Judgment
[1:35:47] of this world now shall the prince of
[1:35:50] this world
