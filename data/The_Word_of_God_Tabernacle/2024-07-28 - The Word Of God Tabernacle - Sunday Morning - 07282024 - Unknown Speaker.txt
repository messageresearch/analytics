to the scripture second Peter uh chapter 1 and then we're going to start in second Peter chapter one praise the Lord second Peter chapter 1 just kind of gota kind of go through this as a as a scriptural lesson if you will probably take a couple of services to do but I want to speak on the spiritual growth amen spiritual growth brother bam titled it statue of a perfect man amen but we find this scripture that he preached that out of in second Peter uh verses 1-10 so uh chapter 1 verses 1-1 so that's where I want to begin my scripture reading today 2 Peter 1 1-10 before we do though could just bow our heads for another word of pray Lord Jesus very thankful again lord of the blessings that you give us every day thank you Lord for the spirit that we felt thank you Lord to know that we meet together like this Lord and we come to this place that uh we come in your name and we're to there together in your name you're there and we thank you Lord that we don't come in the name of a man we don't come in the name of a pastor a church a denomination we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the only name that whereby man could be saved that precious name that should be revered and worshiped and spoke of in love and and reverence Lord that precious name that means so much to us Lord it means it meant so much to John that Lord when that when your name was spoke he leaped in his mother's womb hadn't been felt for months thought he was dead but John the Baptist leaped to life when the name Jesus was mentioned Lord what a time it is today if that'll happen to them then God what should it do to each of us that we jump in joy that we jump in in faith that we jump in in spirit Lord knowing that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're more real to us now than even when we first begun we do know Lord that anytime just anytime we're believing with expectation or heart just anytime God you're going to call us home to be with you Lord we're looking for our loved ones that have gone on before to appear before us at any time God when we do that Lord we know I believe the door will be shut at that point Lord but we do know at that time God we won't have but maybe 30 days or so left here God may you just help us may you grant that blessing Grace Lord as we continue to press this battle with all that we have and all the wickedness and things that's going on in the world today and oh how Wicked it is getting how demented how demonic it is getting Lord hell is hell has been opened and is wreaking havoc upon the Earth and upon the people oh God just just one more Lord if it just be your will God one more time Lord that we could have a chance somehow that there's an ear out there there's a heart out there there's there's someone Lord that we could speak to to help somehow to keep them out of the pits of hell Lord help us to be able to do it Lord God may you just grant us your anointing and your grace Lord we just Commit This service the remaining part of it to you Lord may you speak to us from your word once again and show us in here what you'd have to help us see and know God we commit it to you we ask your blessings upon it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen second Peter chapter 1 amen read vers 1-10 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our of Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the brother Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall you can be seated if You' like amen ye shall never fall I I drew this on the on the board here I'm not really necessarily going to go to the board or write anything on the board just the thing that brother brandom had give us for this pyramid of the Statue of a perfect man pyramid amen I also got something that my sister uh I believe it was my sister she uh not crochet but crossstitch she cross stitched some of these and gave them to different ones and I like to hang it in here somewhere I haven't decided where yet but uh it's it's a it's a beautiful depiction of the Statue of a perfect man amen and of course uh we won't be I won't be going into so much the church ages or The Messengers to those Ages which you can see on here my main object my main objective today is the spiritual growth that we get from uh this scripture and from these things but uh I thought about showing that instead of this but it's kind of small so it's fairly difficult to see the lettering on that maybe when we get it hung up you can look at it a little closer but I'm sure that we've all probably have maybe pictures like this or uh in different books and things like that we have it and have it with the church ages and with the messengers on it and how it's uh different ones different people have done different ways people have made religion out of this uh have taken this have taken this and made a basically a religion within the message out of it uh they I've seen some where they've taken love the Capstone off and uh put something in the middle and all and I personally don't necessarily care to add anything beyond what brother brandom told us what he what was drawn and what we see in the scripture uh but different people had their different takes on it and that's that's up to them that's okay I actually had one time uh somebody added to the bottom of this uh a brother I met in Florida one time he come and ministered for us I actually actually probably about the one time I actually had to tell a minister and get up behind the pull pit and say I disagree with him I think that's like uh uh it was it was a major enough disagreement I felt in my heart that I actually told the congregation I disagree with the brother on this he actually added something down here and I I I just God bless him uh if that's how he feels and just I mean maybe the Lord reveals to me that at some time but I I just like to leave it the way it the way it was brought to us by the prophet the way that we see it in the scripture so you may see so you may see tons of variances of if you type in Google statue of a perfect man pyramid or something like that you'll see all kinds of different ones and and that's okay that that that's that's up to them I just like to keep it simple just as the spiritual growth that we know that this scripture is speaking to us as and and in that is contained um what we believe to be true now some people believe that the only way to get up here is to is to have the only way to get the Holy Ghost is every one of these has to be perfected in your life uh I don't personally believe it that way I I personally believe that you can't get any of these perfected in your life until you're born again it to me is the holy ghost that helps bring them now now different anybody really anybody in the world not even a Christian can have faith uh some portion of Faith some Measure of Faith any actually the Bible says every man's dealt The Measure of Faith amen or or patience uh there there's plenty of people out there that have tons of patience probably have a lot more than I do amen as a born again Christian probably have a lot more than any of us or or the temperance or any of these virtues anybody can possess any portion of these virtues at any time that doesn't make them a Christian that doesn't make them in that statue of form of God or the perfect man amen we know brother Ram talked about the kindly old priest could manifest the gifts uh a whole lot more than even Jesus did uh if you look at it in the flesh look at it in the natural so anybody can possess any of these at any time but the growth of Christian begins with a foundation that Foundation is the faith the faith is our foundation and it grows from there so as we continue to add we continue to grow we continue to come become more in the likeness of Jesus Christ until we reach that Capstone which is love which is God which is Jesus Christ Christ is love amen brings us to that place amen that Capstone but let's look at the script scripture a little bit before we start in on on this statue here I want us to look at this because I I I've just give you some things I want to look at the scripture to help understand maybe to a degree why I I don't just try to come up with things that that I feel now I know the Lord has given me things and of course uh I believe uh I trust that to be from the Lord when I know it's the Lord doing it uh but uh I also believe that uh if I feel the Lord's given me something I like to go find it in the scripture right I like to check it with the L with the word I like to check it with the message I like to see if this is something because you know the devil talks too and we as Christians should be mature enough now to know when it's one voice or the other we should if we're not friends we need to really be in more prayer uh to listen to that voice more because we should know when it's the voice of God and when it's the voice of the devil first of all we should know based on the fact that if it's a voice of God it's going to be scriptural if it's the voice of the devil it's not now it might be 90% scripture it might be scripture just like Satan uh told Jesus on the Mount of Temptation uh when when Satan gave Jesus the word but the word was misplaced it was misused so see we should be uh adults enough Christians uh to be able to know which is which we should be if not we we need to be in Greater bore of prayer with the Lord so we recognize it's the Lord's voice but beyond that we like to make sure I like to make sure and check it with the word what does the word say about that so when I make my comments when I talk about uh this and the variances that people have put on it and the different ways that people that men have preached about it and and uh uh drew it in different ways and added things to it uh you that's okay but again I like to do it based on what I feel led to do that I find from the scripture amen so let's go back to the scripture real quick and and and we'll instead of just reading through break this down a little bit okay so Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ and them that have a Ain to them that obtain like Precious Faith so is that does that me is that you amen amen then then that's our name is right there so you could say uh to Newton that has obtained like Precious Faith to Dennis that has obtained like Precious Faith to Julie that is a me put your name there yes to us to me that has attained like Precious faith it pertains to me with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord now he mentioned the word knowledge uh several times here and it is obviously a part of our stature here too uh through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power God's divine power has given unto us Newton again put your name there he has given unto me us all things he's left nothing out but he's given unto us so if we look at what the scripture says what the prophet brought to us and we apply it as such there's nothing else we need so people can add and change and manipulate all they want and that's up to them and that's fine again I'm not criticizing that but we know the scripture here tells us that in this we have all things there's nothing likeing through God's power he's given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness amen so everything we need in life everything we need as a Christian for godliness God has given us through his power amen amen through the knowledge of him God Jesus Christ that has called us me again your name to glory and virtue now look at this whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises now there's there's so many great and precious promises that are listed in the scripture that belong to us it was would take months to list them all or to preach on them all amen we know as Bible readers we know as Christian Bible readers we know what many if not all those promises are we can't recall them all obviously but the but the spirit of God has given us those promises has given us those great and precious promises that by these by those promises one the number one number one most prominent promise is what the promise of the Holy Spirit yes the promise of the holy spirit that was given to us is the token that we need first of all to live our lives by and to get out of this world in a Rapture that's our token that's our ticket amen those great and precious promises that we might be partakers of the divine nature that divine nature is the nature of God right amen and your nature that your nature is what identifies you amen an identification the nature of a tree is identified in its fruit the nature of a plant is identified in its flower its Bloom the nature of an animal is is identified in its characteristics the identification of our divine nature of a human is how we act how we talk how we live how we uh uh breathe everything about us our divine nature how we live our lives either projects Jesus Christ or or something else amen a lot of times ourselves are an evil nature but the divine nature is the ultimate that we are that we are to attain the divine nature to break it down is just the Holy Ghost thank you Lord that God's divine nature because the Holy Ghost is what identifies Jesus Christ in the spirit when he was here the life he lived the things he did the places he went the how he T how he act his preaching his ministering his word everything about it exuded that nature what was the nature the nature of Jesus Christ that's the holy spirit it's his spirit that is in us we've been given those great precious promises those promises that we might be partakers of the Divine nature now it does not say anywhere that I found that you've got to attain the Perfection of every one of these levels to get that that's not what it says it says by the power of God we've been given these promises that we might be partakers of the Holy Ghost Amen in the Holy Ghost we have all of the godliness of the of the spiritual growth that we are to obtain in life so for those who say say you've got to do this to get him uh I'm sorry doesn't in my opinion it doesn't go like that the scripture again it's not my opinion really actually it's what the scripture says amen the scripture says by his Divine Promises by his precious promises we might be partakers of the Holy Ghost of his divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through love amen the Holy Spirit brings us out of that you you you're a you're an exodus you're a you are a called out group you are a you are a called out from the church amen you are a separate group you're a separate people you don't belong to the world this world is not our home we we are sojourners here yes this is this this Cosmos now the world belongs to us this Earth but the cosmos is not ours amen we're just here as solders pilgrims in a Strange Land and friend the land is getting stranger every day stranger every day I'll be honest I used to really enjoy like watching the Olympics but after that drag queen thing with the Last Supper it's like I I I've lost complete interest I I really almost I'm not saying I Happ but don't want to even see it now yeah after after that demonic debacle that disgusting it just hell has been opened the lid has been taken off and it is here on Earth right now and it's displaying itself and shoving it down the throats of anybody that'll listen yes amen I reject it but the truth is that's not a part of me anyway right this world that they're they're having their world it's not mine it's theirs I'm a part of it I like to do my part to help make it as good as it can be amen I like to try to be influenced I don't I don't just lay like a lump on a log and not try to do anything I try to but uh and help people along the way but the truth is when it boils down to it it's not ours anyway it's not our home it's not our Cosmos all that that we see and Witness all going to be burned over yeah amen I hope I hope every one of those people find Jesus Christ and don't go to hell I hope I pray every one of them every one of those I want them to I don't want anybody to go to hell right no one unfortunately there's going to be because the scripture says there is but uh I pray they don't but we as Christians have escaped the world amen escape the corruption of the World by the Holy Spirit the holy spirit in being born again Drew you out and put you it doesn't make us more important it doesn't make us special it doesn't make us to look down on people not even close if not for the grace of God there go I amen but what it does is it puts us in a position in an exalted position spiritually in the mind in the eyes of God almighty yeah amen that Holy Spirit pulled us out and made made you a new creature in Christ Jesus only people that are members of that club if you will pardon the crude expression but only ones that are members of that club are the also the other people that have been born again and received that divine nature right amen all that being said now look at this all that being said we are partakers of the Divine nature look at this now that we have escaped the world through lust but now look what the fifth verse says and beside this amen he just give us all that we just went through all that now beside this now what does that mean that means that means okay we did this now uh while this just came in my mind let's just let let's just think about a meal uh if you've got a meal I'm a meat and potatoes guy most people probably know that by now but uh if you got a steak and you got a potato and you got a salad you eat the steak you got steak you're eating amen but there's other food besides that yeah amen so when you most people I mean maybe different people eat differently but most people people or I will take a bite of steak and I'll eat my steak and then I'll set my steak aside not literally but I won't eat another bite of steak I'll go to my potato and now eat on my potato I'm not eating my steak anymore I'm eating my potato beside the steak I have a potato besides my potato I have a salad you understand so when it's saying that we've got all of this the the the the Holy Spirit the Aker of God's divine nature now he says beside this okay that's been settled that's been done that finishes that you're a partaker of God's divine nature now beside that what do we do besides that we add we add virtue to our faith we start with faith amen you understand does that make sense yeah yeah besides that not it doesn't say that you have to have the Holy Ghost you can only get the Holy Ghost after this it says you've been a partaker of the Holy Ghost and now beside the Holy Ghost you need to do this you've been born again you have the Holy Ghost you're a Christian have been born again now now you've got that now let's go and and let's let's work on our spiritual growth yes not the other way around amen a lot of you want to work on your spiritual growth to the point of having the Holy Ghost no you get the Holy Ghost you're born again and then you work on your spiritual growth right amen besides this praise the Lord you've got that that's been established and and and uh been made known now beside that now what do we do now we get to actually growing in the Lord we got the Holy Ghost now it's time to grow in the Lord the holy spirit is just the beginning point the divine nature is just our starting point you're just a babe in Christ you're a newborn creature in Christ at that point now we need to start growing right now we get to our statue of a perfect man and it says fifth verse besides this so so my point is I guess I hammered that a little to to get to the point to understand I try not to just make stuff up I I don't just say well the lord gave me this I I want something concrete something before I dismissed a probably tens of thousands of people's belief in this I want to know why what scripture basis do I have it's right here am amen it's right here you're a partaker of the divine nature you have the Holy Ghost and besides that now that's just the beginning you start and you start growing amen that's why I base it that way not because I'm just arrogant and say well why just don't believe that brother no no no I don't want to dismiss someone who might have a legitimate thought or belief but if it's not scriptural friend I I I'm not going to go with it if it's if you can't back it up by scripture I don't care what Vision anybody had I don't care about Flames going off and videos I I don't I don't care about all the people have uh uh uh the founder of the Mormon denomination had a dream the the whole denomination is based on the man's dream right amen amen I probably wouldn't say say this if Gilson was here but pretty much the entire Muslim religion is based on a man's dream I I don't I don't base it on brother bram's dream or anybody's dream I don't base what I believe on anybody's dream anybody's uh uh uh a prophecy or any I don't base what I believe on any of that I believe I base what I believe on the scripture and if I can't find it in here then I'm not going to believe it I'm not going to preach amen not even if brother Brown said it I'm not going to now I've never found anything that he said that wasn't in there so I got to have a little caveat to that and all the preaching I've done for 35 years I've never found one time where what he said wasn't in here but if it wasn't I wouldn't believe it I wouldn't preach it I don't care about anybody's dream I don't care any of that people base religions and stuff and and experiences all they had this great experience and this is what they come up with that you got to if it's not scriptural leave it alone amen leave it alone now look let's let's start with this besides this give all diligence now that's a powerful word amen give all haste give all expedience amen all work all effort diligence give all diligence to uh to to add to your faith virt now we got faith faith Faith's a pretty easy one amen but it's also a very encompassing one let's go over to Matthew uh Hebrews chapter 11 I'm going to look at doing going through scripture uh maybe some quotes uh to to bring each one of these points hopefully maybe a a little light a little more light on them faith is something that we probably all already are very astute in and believe in look to but um let's start with Hebrews chapter 11 the faith chapter amen Hebrews chapter 11 verse1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the substance in other words it's something tangible yes faith is something that is tangible you say well Faith you can't buy it at the store you can't touch it you can't smell it you can't eat it how is it tangible because Faith brings the things that are not into existence right faith is what does it faith is the substance of things hoped for it is an Evidence of Things Not Seen well now how can you have evidence if it's not tangible amen you go try to you go try to prove in a court and present present evidence that didn't exist tangibly you can't see it can't smell it can't taste it can't hear it how you going to present that as evidence in a court of law you can right that's not evidence your honor I believe it is that doesn't make it so right right not in the court of law right amen it might make it so to you but it doesn't make it so period or in a court of law you can't use it as evidence you have to have something tangible faith is an Evidence faith is a substance and that faith is is things that we cannot see that is made tangible we had a lot of testimonies in here last week things that were not tangible Faith made them tangible Faith brought them to the point of testimony to the point of saying God healed me God performed a miracle in my life God did this for me it wasn't there but now it is am now it's evidence praise God you could go to a doctor and the doctor say you're ridd with cancer and you can come forth and be prayed for and God can miraculous miraculously heal you a miracle you go back to the doctor and the doctor looks at him and says there's no more cancer in your body I don't know where it went and you can tell him I do I know where it went do you want to know where it went I'll tell you where it went amen my my wife had the thing same thing happened to her when she cut the tentant in her foot I'm not going to tell the whole story but when she went back to the doctor after God healed her we laid hands on her and prayed for her and God healed her she went back to the doctor the doctor looked at her foot and he he had this and I wasn't there but just by her original testimony I I'll never forget this but from 30 years ago looks at her and says stand up cuz she she's sitting in the chair and he's got her got foot and the doctor's looking at her foot says stand up stands up walk around a while walk around a little bit and I may get some of this wrong dude I'm sorry but I tried to my best to remember walk around hop jump skip run in place whatever you can do just to aggravate that tendon what can I do to aggravate that tendon you know now sit back down sit back down we have the foot to the doctor doctor looks at her foot again and says Miss Bennett I don't know what happened to you but you have a brand new tendon in your foot now you explain that right before it wasn't tangible but when prayer and intercession entered in and God performed a miracle in her foot he she could go back to the doctor and the doctor could identify that there's something there that wasn't there before praise God faith did it Faith brought a substance Faith had an Evidence and the evidence witness to that doctor now whatever he did with it we don't know but that man could never the rest of his life deny what happened to my wife he knows and has X-rays of a split tendon and it was rolling up in her foot she had knots on both tops and bottles of that cup gone foot straight everything perfect he has to understand and witness that what was before is not now God it became evidence yes the evidence in a court would say but your honor my foot is perfectly well and the and the judge can say oh no your foot is cut then you could bring it and said Doctor is her foot cut is her tendon cut your honor I've got evidence and proof I got an x-ray to prove that her tendon is perfectly fine his testimony brand new tendon in your foot praise the Lord Faith brought it to pass Faith made it so it wasn't one way now it is praise God that's why we can say faith is a substance amen faith is an Evidence evidence it's an Evidence of things that can't be seen but it's an evidence that we know and believe that it's there yes people can say well you're still sick doesn't matter God's word said I'm well amen evidence can say I still have blurry eyesight but God's word says I'm Healed right yes praise the Lord glasses are not the word says I'm Healed and that's what matters praise the Lord Jesus we believe what faith says and faith says by these great and precious promises that you are well that you are healed that you are blessed that you are all the great blessings God gives us it's an evidence for by it for by faith second verse Now by faith the elders obtained a good report now how about us how about the young on the elders obtained a good report what about the young I'm a young the did the youngans have a good report do do we have obtained a good report by the same faith that the elders did yes praise God I believe so I think a lot of times it kind of gets overlooked maybe dismissed a little bit unless it's something just outstanding but it's like I said the other day how many things that God does for us every day most of which we probably never even know amen but we give him thanks for it anyway we give him thanks anyway the elders obtained a good report by faith through faith third verse through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in other words through faith God spoke and brother B said God had to believe his own word yes for it to come to pass praise God he's the father of faith we believe that's where we get our faith by faith we believe God spoke and he believed through faith now you can you could say well uh how can God why would God need Faith well he is faith yeah you don't say well God needs love no he doesn't he is love say God needs Faith No he is Faith praise the Lord that's where we get our faith amen but in that he believed when he spoke he believed when he said let there be he knew that it would be now brother R said it may have been 10,000 years but it was going to happen it happened yeah amen when God said let there be now I know when he when he when he uh made the Earth in the way it is today with the plants the bot life animal life and the forming of all I know that took the six days seventh day rested but when God in the beginning in in the beginning Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that was it yeah amen amen now how long it took to do that we don't know right we don't know wellam said it could have been 10 thousands of years could have been millions of years but when he said God created the Heaven and the Earth yes well then the six days he started doing the firmament in the heavens and then the earth and the oceans and the fish and the botney life and the human life that's all that came afterwards but when God created the Heaven and the Earth brother R said that could have been millions of years we don't know but when God spoke it was going to happen amen and by faith it came in de be there was a there was no tree God spoke and botney life came and now there's a tree amen amen tree came from nothing it's like brother random said science says that they are the ones that you live by that you go by that you believe in science is the one he said well um they can they can manipulate this and they can create that and they can cause this reaction to happen this and all this by their limited understanding of physics and and uh and Science and all that they do and I probably sound like an idiot because I don't know anything about it but all that they can explain and do and and create and and uh manipulate and atoms and all all the sciency stuff they can do all that but then you go up and get the Hawkins did now but get the most brilliant scientist the most brilliant this is whatever said now I want you to build me this blade of grass could he do it of course not amen because it took Faith to bring that blade of grass yeah amen now they can take the blade of grass and they can tear it down and they can find what all is in it and what it's made up of and how it reacts and all that they can figure all that stuff out but I want you to give me a blade of grass first right amen I think it's like uh I forgot the story but it's like you know well I can do this but give me some dirt no no you got to create your own dirt right well well how am I going to do that exactly yeah that's the whole point by faith through faith the worlds were framed by the word of God God said let there be it was so which things so so the things that we see now were not made by things which do appear what were they made by faith faith in the word that was spoken the spoken word faith and belief in the spoken word that's what brought it to pass God spake God spoke it let there be a tree that tree came there it is yes amen amen people have been arguing scientist been arguing for years and years and eons and eons which came first the chicken or the egg I know I'm as dumb as a rock bag of rocks but I know where it came from right amen the chicken cuz God said let there be a chicken there was a chicken in that chicken was all it needed to reproduce there come the eggs amen chicken came first which came first the tree of the pinecomb the tree came first cuz you can't have a pine cone without the tree right the tree came first Common Sense yes but all people that make millions of dollars a year can figure that out why because they don't know God when you know God you know the answer right right there came a tree so the thing that did not exist brought the tree in into existence now from that tree you can make this pull pit amen now what you see didn't come from something that you saw it came from something that was unseen so it came from that tree where did the tree come from well it came from this tree it came from this tree you're going to trace it back so far that it's going to get to the point that it came from when God said let there be yes there's the tree from that tree come another tree from that tree come another another another another another finally from that original tree where God spoken and that tree was there came a tree that made this B now you can see it it's an Evidence I can touch this I can bang on it I can feel it don't necessarily want to taste it but I can see it right I can feel it amen it's tangible Faith brought this into a substance now it's an Evidence this pull pit is here here it is but it didn't come from something you could see it came from Faith believe God had to believe amen and there it came so now the things that were that uh the the faith that we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen faith God fourth verse by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain what is uh faith faith is a revelation faith is a revelation that Abel had that he believed in God that regardless of what the circumstances may show he knew amen probably from Adam his daddy told him that it took blood to be pleasing to the Lord right because that was what God did Adam didn't do that God did that amen Cain didn't do that but Abel did it why did Abel do it because Adam was his daddy Cain didn't do it why because Adam is not Cain's daddy amen I I now I believe when both boys came forth that Adam probably treated them both like his boys he knew they weren't I'm sorry I maybe I'm adding but I can't believe that would have pushed Cain away and just Tau a Abel right amen I believe he called him to both but see the problem was Kain didn't have a revelation he had nothing in him to receive Revelation from God yes because he was of the serpent the evil one he was the Bible says he was of that evil one the devil amen of the serpent seed he was not from the lineage of Adam right not being from the lineage of Adam which is the lineage of God he had nothing in him to receive Revelation unfortunately Saints unfortunately there are millions maybe even billions of people in the world today that still have no representation right they have nothing in them to be able to receive Revelation from God even if God were to come and show it to them right in their faces they would not believe it right yeah because from God it has to be revealed it has to be revealed from God not just a simple understanding not a scientific belief not some kind of proof or experiment has to be Revelation by faith faith is a revelation by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaking by Revelation Abel maybe Abel and Cain received the same information obtained the same story from Adam but God Abel by God's revelation knew what it took it took blood Cain did not Cain thought Cain thought like a lot of people do today shall I say a lot of Christians do today oh this would be good enough for God a this I I'll just give him some of my fruits I'll give him actually I'll give him the best fruits I got I'll give him the best bought me life that I've raised and that I've nurtured and and I've that I've harvested I'll give him the very best I got I believe Cain did give him the very best but his best wasn't good enough because it wasn't by Revelation by revelation God was accepting as a sacrifice a blood sacrifice and bought me life does not carry blood right amen so Cain had no Revelation Abel did Cain got mad at him and killed his brother as a result even after God told him I'll give I will I will accept you if you just do right right but he couldn't why couldn't he because it wasn't in him to do that's my whole point today yeah a lot of times I get so frustrated sometimes it's so hard I I told y'all the other day that I made the comment the week before last about um one of our workers he smokes he drinks a lot energy drinks and he's not going to live to be 40 and he's only and he's 35 the poor guy I mean I think I told you that the manager said something about because the cigarettes were Cheaper by the carton or something in Georgia and he said something about uh well Newton will take something for you he's a minister nobody will pay attention I'm like I'm not taking you one cigarette mostel carton I'm not taking you anything like that and I said I'll you know I told you I to comeing I said I'll take you a gun which is basically the same thing and this time when we met up uh he's my travel partner he actually lives right here in town and I said I hope you weren't offended by that he said oh no no I said I just want you to understand I care about you and I see that you're killing yourself yeah and I hate to watch you kill yourself yeah that that was my whole point he just said I understand didn't change anything but I wanted to understand I I these things come because I care about you not because I don't like you I'm not trying to be uh cynical or or hateful I want you to understand I'm trying to tell you the truth so you quit killing yourself right amen anyway that but but but again outside of that if he has nothing in him to receive it he's just going to be what he is people are just going to be what they are if there's that if there's nothing in there for them then that's just all they can be so anyway it's a hard one for me to grasp but it's just the way it is fifth verse by faith I better hurry we'll never get off Faith by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God how did he please God same way he was translated by faith amen he pleased God by Faith said how can I please God by faith amen for sixth verse without faith it is impossible to please God Amen sixth verse but without faith it is impossible to please him with faith Revelation amen it brings you to an understanding what is pleasing to the Lord and what isn't what makes the Lord happy and what makes him upset amen praise the Lord for he that cometh to God must believe he that cometh to God Must Believe must believe that he is that God is and that God is a rewarder of them that diligently there's that word again diligently seek him now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but how many actually diligently seek God Amen that's personal between you and God like I said I'm not looking for hands raised I just want an interior examination of yourself to say where do I stand in this amen amen where am I placed in this scripture being diligent about seeking the Lord remember what the word diligent is amen Relentless pressing forward not stopping uh being diligent seek him that we seek Him by faith amen seventh verse Now by faith Noah being warned of God of these things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went by faith he Ser uh so in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob and HS with him of the same promise for he looked praise the Lord for he looked for a city which have foundations whose Builder and maker is God Amen I'm still looking for that myself amen amen I'm still looking for that I believe we all are yes Builder and maker is God 11 verse through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because because she judged him God Faithful who had made the promise how about us do we find him faithful who's made all those great and precious promises that we just talked about do we find him faithful he made promises do we find him faithful to execute all of the promises that he promised to give us I mean I don't know how many times I've gotten promises from people that's never been kept yeah dozens hundreds I don't know from different people good good minded people good-hearted people I probably I I probably actually give more promises I weren't able to fulfill uh even to God uh then I've had promises broken to me so I'm as guilty as anybody but God never broke a promise never can never will can't do it amen amen we find him faithful that promised it he's the one that promised it we believe it therefore sprang there even one even of one in him and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them AAR off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth amen but they believed it how' they believe it they believed it by faith am praise the Lord let me read this to you this is out of statue of a perfect man see the world we've escaped that now we've escaped the world now he is addressing this to the church that's why we are here this morning to find out what is that way what is God's requirements there is not a person here it is now listen close I'm believing this identifies every one of us in here this morning there is not a person in here that loves God but that wants to become more like Christ I believe I pray that's every one of our desires amen that we all desire as it is witnessed that brother bam said that loves God that wants to be more like him amen amen help me to be more like him Lord help me to be more like you now it's laid out here every Christian I'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid here they're probably oldest in the building I think they were in their 90s about that time oldest in the building but if I would ask them even them in their 90s if I would ask them what is your heart's desire it' be to be closer to God Amen you go ask other people think about it for a minute what if it was what if there was literally a genie that came out of a bottle when you rubbed it and he said you have three wishes I I I would imagine it'd be hard to imagine all the different wishes that people would come up with amen this is not obviously a witch this is a wish this is no Genie this is nothing magical this is God and His precious promises but just think about it if people had the opportunity ask for whatever you want itude wealth and riches Fame and and notoriety powerful president CW the whole world what would you be what would people say amen I remember one woman one time brother random called her Hatty right her last name actually wasn't right at the time it was something else and so people preached an entire messages on the fact that her name was Dy right and she was right actually her name at the time was not right you go and you read if you're reading the message enough I forgot what it was but if you go read the message enough you'll find out and note that wasn't her name at that time anyway but hady right was sitting there in a church service and brother Brandon was talking about the story faith of the squirrels that had come that that he was out hunting you know the story I'll be brief but he's sitting there and no squirrels but he needed food to feed his family and a voice spoke to him and says what do you hear for and of course you know when a voice speaks like that if you've ever heard that voice it's like who what what what was that somebody there you've ever heard it it's it's not like oh wow hi God how you doing it's it's not anybody does that to you they say God spoke to them like that an audible voice they like hey God what's up how you doing no no God didn't speak to that person right uhuh no it's like who is that what what's going on there's a there's a spirit there's an aura that comes with with God and it's not hi what's up God it's not right you say well me and God are tight might be but when that voice speaks is there's reverence amen there's there's a somber reverence there it's like brother Brown brother Billy Paul talked about the testimony when brother randam uh when God let brother random sh wake him up to see the angel of the Lord he woke him up with a pillow over his face and said now I want to tell you something he told me that you could see him he's standing over in the corner now don't be afraid and he slowly took the pillow off his eyes he looked up and he saw and that angel he said was standing in the corner with his arms folded like this right and there was no hey hey it's good to find uhuh there's none of that there was fear and reverence and that angel in an instant turned into a mist and went out the window or went out of the room just like there was there was no play When God speaks there there's there's there's no playe right amen but that when that voice speaks if God were to speak just think about that to to to speak to us what our desires would be what would we want from God had he was sitting there brother R was telling that story and there's probably obviously Skeptics in the congregation audience wherever he was I think he was at the Tabernacle but she sat there and she said that ain't nothing but the truth brother brandham and the spirit of the Lord spoke to brother brandham and said tell her she can have whatever she asked for she was a poor lady she had had all the money she wanted shackle for a house she had a brand new mansion car whatever she wanted whatever she she wants tell her she can have whatever she wants it didn't have anything to do with fame or money or popularity or substance or goodies or toys or she said I want the salvation of my two boys amen I don't care how those boys lived I don't care how they died they belong to her right they belong to God because the prophet said you have what you asked for now obviously I believe that God knew what she was going to ask it wasn't a rubber Genie bottle thing I believe he knew what she was going to ask and she said selfishly I want the salvation of my two boys amen but I wonder what would other people ask for right what would people want if they had the opportunity to get whatever they want brother Ram said I believe there's not anybody in here that loves God that if I ask you what you would want the number one desire in your heart it would be to be closer to God amen amen that's an admirable thing an admirable request a truth that we live let me read these couple more I think it's gotten wow I didn't get all Faith statue of a perfect man again he says God wants uh let me just drop down here now uh a holy God could not condone sin so nothing could touch that mountain where God was talking about Moses of course Mount Si then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of that blood to us the promise of the of the Holy Ghost the promise of a changed nature a partaker of the divine nature you know to be a partaker of the divine nature your Nature has to die yes right amen die burned out we've gone through it before that old snake nature die burned out Holy Spirit come in amen amen Holy Spirit must come in yes or the devil will come back with seven of his buddies that are worse than him right amen that's the scripture come out of the blood to us through the blood that we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit and we become new creatures in Christ Jesus one more perfect Faith listen now now notice this is one of my favorite quotes of all time out of the millions I have this is one of my favorites multi-millions and multili I have millions of favorite quotes but this is of my most favorites perfect Faith notice now notice perfect faith is a master of all circumstances praise the Lord I like that perfect faith not just faith not just dealt The Measure of Faith now perfect uh we're going to look at later I thought I'd actually get to it today but not getting there perfect actually scripturally there is a perfect that is a sinless Flawless Perfection but there's also a per a perfection in the scripture that speaks of just being mature and a full age of a grown mature Christian amen perfect Faith doesn't mean that it's in you as a human Flawless no it means that it's a mature Faith yeah amen you don't you don't take your enemy and say you're a frog and cast him into a frog because you got the faith to do it Jesus could have done that every one of them that tried to crucify him you're a flea you're a frog you're I cast you into a be a snake or whatever he didn't do that when when Satan the devil came at again the Mount of Temptation he could have said you're a you're a flee on a frog's back he could have cast him into anything he wanted to no he didn't defeat him that way he defeated him with the same way that we defeated him the word yes amen defeated him with the word which is the same weapon and the same thing that we defeat him with praise the Lord in his Humanity he showed that we could defeat him the exact same way that he defeated perfect Faith Masters all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it yes praise the Lord so I don't care what it looks like I don't care what it sounds like like feels like I don't care how sick they are I don't care how in a deathbed I don't care circumstances make no difference to God if they make no difference to God then they should make no difference to us a mature faith will master that circumstance a mature faith will call those things that are not as though they were and bring it into existence so that we have a substance so we have an Evidence and look friends that's just the found Foundation that's just the beginning that's just the start my hour I'm over an hour is gone and and haven't even scratched it really but it's it's just the foundation yes it's just the start it's just the beginning but on that you can't build this without building it on that though it's like the man who tries to build his hand on his house on the seashore or something it'll it'll crumble but you set that house on a solid rock on a foundation a house a hold yeah it's got to be on a solid foundation and that faith has got to be that faith of perfect faith of a mature Faith but it's a faith that you use what you have because different people are different levels at different times no big eyes and little yous but some people have a little more faith there's actually a gift of faith even in Corinthians there's a gift of faith so there's the different Lev but you use what you have you take what you've been a lotted or or or how much you've grown in faith you take the growth of your faith and use it yeah amen use it whatever you got say I just have the teeniest little Mustard Seed well then you've got the power to move this tree over here you've got the power to move that mountain right if you don't want the catalinas there anymore move them you said you had the greatest the tiniest little bit of Faith well the faith faith to gr us a must mustard SE to move mountains right then what excuse do we have praise the Lord but it's got to be an unfettered Faith he because well I don't know maybe maybe not we we'll see I it might be you know I don't amen you said and and the thing that I that I get and and I do it too because if you don't know you don't know but so many times we get to this place say well if it's God's Will and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that unless God's revealed to you whether it is his will or not that's something different different praise the Lord but when we get to the place to praying for something that's say as serious is that we say Lord what is your faith in this word if it's not it's like I told you I I'll close with this I'm sorry I just keep going it's like I've told the story several times about my sister I prayed for my sister's healing I prayed pray she had cancer breast cancer she was dying of bre of of cancer and I prayed and prayed and prayed and she kept going she kept going she kept going she was doing great prayed and prayed and prayed and we went and visited them for Thanksgiving and her and uh Micah and tabius would spent time with my sister they went out they went bowling I don't remember what all they did but they did all they they take her wigs and put them on their head we got pictures of with her wig on and all uh just had fun see my sister was just a bundle energy if you will especially in her situation but uh they just had a great time that Thanksgiving got home and I I was pastoring two churches at the time I was well I was pastoring a church and attending another trying to help another one I wasn't pastoring it I I personally don't think a pastor should anyway I I'll just keep that to myself I was pastoring a church I was going over and trying to help take care of this other church and i' went over there had Sunday morning in in cholo went over to a Flagstaff for that evening service and on my way back home my sister came came on my heart I started praying for her again Lord Heal her God I I really love to see him and this was after that time and I'd love to see her raised up Lord just heal her your word says she's healed and you know the the things we We Believe by God's scripture that we verbalize and by Faith Lord I believe she's going to be healed God said stop and I knew that voice I turned I was I can't remember if I was listen listen to music if I listen to a tape brother BR whatever it was I turned it off immediately because I knew what that was uh I used to do that when I was The Courier Service in Florida I'd listened to a lot of tapes when I was in the car and I knew when the spirit of God dropped in that car I'd rake everything off the passenger seat onto the floorboard yeah and god let's talk a while every that's that's one of those times is when God told me to come here that's the truth anyway God a witness to that but I was going across and on Interstate 40 God said stop I turned the radio off and said God why should I stop is there somebody here I I didn't know and he said stop praying for your sister I said Lord I don't want to stop praying for my sister I don't want my sister to die I want her to live I want her I want her to be well I want her to spend more time with us I want her to spend more time with our our children M tath I want her to be here watch them grow up and God said stop praying for her so I said why how many times you you ask God why why you actually answered he said cuz it's time for me to take her home and that was hard I didn't want to go is good her stay he said it's time for her to go home I said well it's your will Lord your will not mine maybe he saw something down the road maybe I don't know I don't know why God does things the way he does them timing and you know I would have loved for her to meet tath his children and but we don't know why but he told me it's time I'm it's time for me to take her home and I can't do it while you're praying for her well you're asking her for my asking me for her healing I can't take her home and that's when I stopped and I said okay Lord I said let your will your will be done not mine whatever your will is Lord I'll I'll stop praying for her I'm not going to pray that you take her I wasn't going to do that but I knew it was the Lord's will at that time and I said Lord and she's in your hands and that was the end of it right after that my mom called me and she said you know you need to get back over here and this was between the time of Thanksgiving and Christmas uh you better get back over here you know Janice is taking a bad turn and so I got some tickets real quick fortunately I had some points so I didn't have much money but I had some points and we all flew back over there and by the time we got there she never regained Consciousness but she was alive she did get to hear voices one last time before she passed on but that was just the will of the Lord amen and sometimes when that happens and we know that that's up to God that's God's doing and we just trust him we believe him and I I believe she was a child of God and if she's a child of God regardless of anything else she'll be there right yes and she's one of the ones I'm looking for at any time amen she's one of the ones that's going to appear at any time yes amen for for the Rapture of us going
