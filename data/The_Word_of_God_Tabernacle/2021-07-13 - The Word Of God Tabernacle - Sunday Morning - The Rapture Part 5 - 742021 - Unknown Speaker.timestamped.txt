[4:18] jesus christ without
[4:20] fear of being imprisoned or or even
[4:22] death lord

[4:41] when the enemy come into elisha lord you
[4:44] you blinded their eyes that they
[4:45] couldn't even see he was elisha
[4:47] i believe elijah i do i believe you do
[4:49] the same thing for those
[4:51] those saints those brothers and sisters
[4:52] around the world who may be in those
[4:54] conditions
[4:55] lord they may be worshipping serving you

[5:05] going
[5:06] for you lord and for your glory and
[5:07] honor for your from your people and god
[5:10] i pray that you bless this service now
[5:12] as we committed to you and pray your
[5:14] holy spirit would have the preeminence
[5:15] once again
[5:16] we rebuke every demonic spirit that
[5:18] would try to hurt hinder and filtrate
[5:20] this service in any way
[5:22] that you would get the glory and honor
[5:23] for all that is said and done
[5:25] lord i pray that you touch shariah now
[5:27] father we've been praying for of course
[5:30] fervently father since um heard about

[5:34] now in the name of jesus christ
[5:36] that a touch from your mighty hand your
[5:38] healing hand god
[5:39] to go where she is right now in that
[5:41] back row lord and touch her
[5:43] and heal her and take that pain from her
[5:45] make her perfectly well father as we
[5:47] know that you are the miracle-working
[5:49] great physician
[5:50] who is touched by the feeling of our
[5:52] infirmities and there's probably never
[5:54] been a person ever lived god that ever
[5:56] suffered a backache like you did

[6:14] into your hands and give you praise
[6:16] honor and glory in the name of the lord
[6:17] jesus christ we pray
[6:19] amen amen in first thessalonians chapter
[6:22] 4
[6:23] verse 13 we'll begin reading but i would
[6:26] not have you to be ignorant brother
[6:27] concerning them which are asleep that
[6:29] you sorrow not even as others which have
[6:30] no hope
[6:31] for if we believe that jesus died and
[6:33] rose again even so then which
[6:35] uh also which sleep in jesus will god
[6:37] bring with him
[6:39] for this we say unto you by the word of
[6:41] the lord that we which are alive and
[6:42] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[6:44] not prevent them
[6:45] which are our sleep for the lord himself
[6:47] shall descend from heaven
[6:48] from heaven with a shout with a voice of
[6:51] the archangel with the trump of god and
[6:52] the dead in christ shall rise first
[6:55] then we which are alive and remain shall
[6:57] be caught up together with them in the
[6:58] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[7:00] so shall we ever be with the lord
[7:02] wherefore comfort you one another with
[7:04] these words you could be seated
[7:06] if you'd like amen we're continuing on
[7:09] with the rapture message this is part
[7:10] five
[7:14] amen and i trust that whatever the what
[7:17] the lord put in my heart last week was a
[7:19] blessing to you
[7:20] the lord just multiplied it to your
[7:22] hearts and just pray it helped you
[7:24] to understand and realize the position
[7:27] that we were coming from
[7:28] on this record that we're talking about
[7:31] and understanding this rapture i want to
[7:33] try to
[7:34] uh try to hit every facet of this
[7:36] rapture i want to try to
[7:38] in integrate every part of
[7:41] of this even though we may know it even
[7:43] though it may be very common to us
[7:45] i want to be able to because there may
[7:47] be some watch this and don't know
[7:49] but i want to integrate every part of it
[7:51] and last week and
[7:53] understanding about the message and the
[7:55] prophet and and the five times of elijah
[7:57] and the things that the lord shows us to
[7:59] understand
[8:00] that this that what this rapture is
[8:04] how it's going to take place i was going
[8:06] to say when but we don't know when
[8:08] right and who's going to be in it right
[8:11] who is it for
[8:12] what this rapture is for and again i
[8:14] believe that this rapture is going to be
[8:16] for the bride it's going to be for this
[8:18] last day
[8:19] elect lady uh of course this last day
[8:22] the
[8:22] alive and remain group will be in this
[8:24] last day the bright as we've said
[8:26] come from the first church age all the
[8:27] way down but this last church age
[8:30] for this this word for this message has
[8:33] come for this last day
[8:34] now i wanted to make sure we understood
[8:36] that uh that it wasn't just for us
[8:39] because a lot of times
[8:41] you hear people talk about a rapture and
[8:43] i understand where they're coming from
[8:44] because
[8:45] their point is that they're ministering
[8:47] to the to the group that they have
[8:49] they're ministering to the people that
[8:50] are alive they're ministering to this
[8:52] last day alive and remain group
[8:54] even if some of us may still go by the
[8:56] grave that we're ministering to that
[8:58] group but
[8:58] we do that with an understanding that
[9:00] the bride is from the first
[9:02] church age all the way down yes and it's
[9:05] not
[9:05] just the bride that listens and believes
[9:08] and lives this message of today
[9:10] is each one of those groups that come
[9:12] down through its messenger
[9:14] through its message and through its word
[9:16] for its day
[9:17] yes each one of those amen and those are
[9:20] the ones that god has pulled
[9:22] out now they've gone by the wave of the
[9:24] grave that's going to come up in the
[9:25] first resurrection
[9:26] for the rest of the dead live not for a
[9:28] thousand years
[9:29] and that that those deads that come and
[9:32] raise up will
[9:33] present themselves before the alive and
[9:35] remain bride
[9:36] then for a minimum of 30 days that we'll
[9:40] be together on earth and will be
[9:42] changed and we'll be caught up together
[9:43] to meet the lord in the air
[9:45] do you understand that that rapture is
[9:47] only for the bride
[9:48] yes the rapture is only for the word
[9:51] bride those that are of the message the
[9:53] word of god for this day
[9:55] because that because the word is what uh
[9:58] is what brings the paramount part of
[10:00] each
[10:01] age that came down through and it is
[10:04] that word for their day
[10:06] brother braham said as each one of them
[10:08] lived to their message
[10:10] they're the ones that will be there well
[10:12] those that live to their message for
[10:14] this day
[10:15] those are the ones that are going to be
[10:17] there i want to make that point
[10:18] very clear yes i wanted to make that
[10:20] point very
[10:21] profound and and that we understand that
[10:24] and that it it comes in our hearts clear
[10:28] like that
[10:28] i forgot to start my recording here
[10:32] but um it reminded me too
[10:35] that um micah had sent me a text i
[10:38] wanted him to read it but he's already
[10:39] sat down
[10:40] i'm going to read it to you it's the
[10:42] text that he sent me
[10:43] after the message sunday uh i i believe
[10:47] that
[10:47] the lord's put a gift on micah's heart
[10:49] and so many times he'll
[10:51] he'll uh send me things to expound on
[10:54] some things the lord has been dealing
[10:56] with and i'll just read it exactly how
[10:58] he typed he says you can't know the lord
[11:00] and his word by knowledge which is what
[11:03] we talked about but by revelation
[11:05] inspiration and spending time with him
[11:08] just like any relationship you don't
[11:10] know a person
[11:11] until you spend time with them now think
[11:14] of this listen very closely this is
[11:16] uh it's very poignant here
[11:19] just like any relationship you don't
[11:22] know a person
[11:23] until you spent time with them and if
[11:25] you sit here and you're married
[11:27] you know how very profound that is
[11:31] yeah you think you know somebody a lot
[11:33] of times especially
[11:35] when you get married you think you know
[11:36] somebody and you don't really know that
[11:38] person
[11:39] until you live with them until you
[11:41] really spend
[11:43] time with them as we'd say quality time
[11:46] or an extended time uh
[11:49] in a home in a setting where it's
[11:52] intimate
[11:53] amen because a lot of things happen in
[11:55] our lives and around people and in
[11:57] church and supermarkets and everywhere
[11:59] else
[12:00] that that that doesn't happen at home
[12:03] there's a lot of things that happen at
[12:04] home don't happen in church if you don't
[12:06] really know that person
[12:07] to know that person until you really get
[12:10] to know them to spend time with them
[12:12] sure they could write down their likes
[12:15] dislikes pet peeves and things that they
[12:17] really like but that isn't knowing them
[12:20] see what we talked about the word last
[12:22] week people read the word and they think
[12:24] they know jesus because they read the
[12:26] word
[12:26] remember this is just a part of christ
[12:28] it's just print on a book
[12:30] amen amen to know christ you've got to
[12:33] know him in the power of his
[12:34] resurrection
[12:35] and the spirit that he come that that he
[12:38] brings he comes into you
[12:39] and that relationship now i'm reading
[12:42] this because of that
[12:44] that is the changing point i want to
[12:46] bring to today's message is that
[12:47] relationship
[12:49] yes amen that relationship
[12:52] you won't know uh how they react to
[12:55] certain situations when they're in
[12:56] stress when they're sad
[12:58] or when they make them laugh when
[13:00] someone treats them poorly how do they
[13:02] react or respond
[13:03] uh when they're in a bad mood how should
[13:05] we respond this
[13:06] depth of understanding or revelation of
[13:08] that person is not complete
[13:10] until you spend time with them and
[13:12] reveal and they reveal themselves and
[13:15] their traits and characteristics to you
[13:18] amen that's uh that that's from
[13:21] my son and i thought that was
[13:24] so exceptional that i wanted to read it
[13:26] to you because
[13:27] it brings in what again i wanted to talk
[13:30] about today and that was that
[13:31] relationship see
[13:33] to have that relationship so many people
[13:35] come to church and they think they know
[13:37] jesus
[13:38] so many people think say they give their
[13:40] heart to life
[13:41] their hearts to the lord and they think
[13:43] they know jesus they read the book they
[13:45] read the bible they read it through
[13:47] cover to cover and they think they know
[13:49] jesus
[13:49] they might know this that and the other
[13:51] about him but they don't really know
[13:53] jesus amen and what does it mean to know
[13:56] him
[13:57] because understand friend this bride
[13:59] that we're talking about
[14:01] this group that's going in a rapture is
[14:04] a
[14:04] word bride yes it has to be a word
[14:07] bride because he is the word
[14:10] and if he is the word she has to be the
[14:13] word
[14:14] to have that relationship with him
[14:16] there's no other group there's no other
[14:19] people
[14:19] there's no other uh way that it can come
[14:22] but to understand
[14:23] that we have to become who he is or that
[14:26] relationship is not going to work
[14:28] yeah i mean think about if you try to
[14:31] again i'll i'll talk and express about
[14:33] marriage but if you have a spouse i mean
[14:36] you might have a a relationship with
[14:39] your spouse
[14:40] uh and then go by horse now try to have
[14:44] the same relationship with that horse as
[14:46] you have with your husband or wife
[14:49] go try to get a dog as much as people
[14:51] try to humanize
[14:52] dogs go try to get a dog and have the
[14:55] same relationship
[14:56] you can have with your son or daughter
[14:58] or your or your husband or wife
[15:00] you can't you won't work you might
[15:04] love them to pieces you might love them
[15:05] to death you as the
[15:07] phrase goes you might you might to do
[15:09] anything for them they might offering
[15:11] unconditional love and this that the
[15:13] other but there's no way to have the
[15:15] same type of relationship
[15:17] because they're not human right
[15:21] if they're not human you can't have that
[15:23] same relationship
[15:25] and if this bride is not a word bride
[15:28] how can she have the right kind of
[15:30] relationship
[15:31] with a word groom
[15:34] she can't she has to be the same as he
[15:37] is
[15:38] or there is no relationship yes she must
[15:42] be a word bride
[15:43] yes amen now if she's a word bride
[15:46] then that puts her in the position of
[15:50] of christ and the word themselves
[15:54] that means that she came from the word
[15:57] that's the only way you can be the work
[15:59] is if you're derivative of the word
[16:01] right let's just go back to the very
[16:03] beginning why don't we do that
[16:05] genesis chapter 2.
[16:13] only way to have that relationship is to
[16:16] know that person
[16:17] to know that person intimately
[16:20] amen i told you a couple weeks ago and
[16:23] then of course said last sunday that i
[16:25] wanted to
[16:26] focus on uh and and i found out
[16:30] this week this is probably going to take
[16:31] a couple services for this but that
[16:33] invisible union that invisible union a
[16:37] lot of times
[16:40] people don't really grasp the concept or
[16:44] the understanding
[16:46] of that invisible union what it is to be
[16:50] in a union that is not
[16:54] a tangible physical union
[16:58] tangible physical relationship and
[17:01] it's an invisible union brother brown
[17:04] priest and
[17:05] like tabernacle and shreveport
[17:07] thanksgiving message or one of them
[17:09] uh in 1965 and he preached the invisible
[17:13] union i challenge you to go listen to it
[17:15] almost text this week
[17:16] for everybody to listen to invisible
[17:18] union if you haven't heard it i'm sure
[17:20] some of you have
[17:21] outstanding message but go listen to it
[17:24] take this some time this week and go
[17:26] this is a couple hours
[17:27] but go listen to it it's just a powerful
[17:30] outstanding message and i
[17:32] won't have the time to get into all of
[17:33] it today but i'm
[17:35] you know well what we expound on is
[17:39] going to be a part of that but it will
[17:41] bless you either way so
[17:42] but now let's go back to the beginning
[17:44] here in genesis chapter 2
[17:47] um well we'll just read it let's just
[17:50] read
[17:51] beginning with verse 21 genesis 2 21
[17:56] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[17:58] fall upon adam
[18:00] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[18:03] god took one of his ribs
[18:05] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[18:08] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[18:10] from man made he
[18:12] a woman and brought her unto the man
[18:15] and adam said this is now bone of my
[18:18] bones
[18:19] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[18:22] called
[18:23] woman because she was taken out of the
[18:26] man
[18:27] amen woman because she was taken out of
[18:30] the man
[18:31] she is now born of my bone flesh of my
[18:35] flesh
[18:36] that's his proclamation the god that
[18:39] god created man adam and that was an
[18:42] amateur god here on earth adam
[18:45] and that was his proclamation is now
[18:47] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
[18:49] why
[18:50] because god had taken him her
[18:53] out of him so that makes her
[18:57] a separate entity in the flesh
[19:00] but it makes them one in spirit amen
[19:04] amen because she came out of him
[19:08] therefore shall a man leave his father
[19:10] mother cleveland to his wife and
[19:12] and they shall be one flesh
[19:15] amen they shall be one flesh
[19:18] now flesh of my flesh and bone of my
[19:21] bone
[19:22] is what adam's declaration is here to
[19:25] the woman that
[19:26] he called woman that was taken out of
[19:28] his body
[19:30] the woman that was taken out of his side
[19:33] she now became a living creature because
[19:36] god did to her the same
[19:38] he did with adam but he took out of adam
[19:40] to create her
[19:42] amen understand now she became as he
[19:45] is she became that flesh and bone
[19:48] because she was a part of him she became
[19:52] human she became flesh she became
[19:56] a a woman now god
[19:59] also in the beginning of course when god
[20:02] made man
[20:03] in the first chapter god made man a
[20:06] like himself and god made man like
[20:09] himself and how is god
[20:11] god is a spirit being so when god made
[20:14] man like himself
[20:16] he made man a spirit being and he put
[20:19] in that spirit being both the masculine
[20:23] and feminist spirit
[20:25] so when god then created man into a
[20:27] flesh body in the garden of eden
[20:30] like a tree out of the ground that man
[20:33] had both masculine and feminist spirit
[20:36] to him because that's who god is
[20:40] you say well god has no feminist well
[20:42] then where did it come from
[20:45] he's got to because he poured what he
[20:48] had
[20:49] into us so he took that and he poured
[20:52] that into adam
[20:54] and when he made adam a flesh man he
[20:56] made adam a flesh man with masculine and
[20:59] and feminist spirit spirited him but now
[21:03] when god
[21:03] took from adam and made a woman
[21:07] he took the flesh part of adam and made
[21:10] the woman out of the flesh
[21:11] but he didn't stop there he took the
[21:14] feminist spirit out of adam
[21:17] and put that feminist spirit into the
[21:19] woman
[21:21] so now the man is solely a masculine
[21:23] being
[21:24] and the woman is solely a feminist speak
[21:27] right now you see how the the world is
[21:30] going today in this country
[21:32] that is absolutely in every way doing
[21:34] its very best by demonic's
[21:37] powers to get people away from that
[21:40] gospel truth of the
[21:43] man beginning not a man no you can born
[21:45] chromosomes whatever doesn't make you
[21:46] man
[21:48] the woman is born chromosomes uh lady
[21:50] parts whatever that's
[21:51] that there's they can be a man if they
[21:53] want to be what do you want to be you
[21:55] want to be a boy or a girl
[21:57] it's okay we'll let you decide hogwash
[22:01] amen god decides before the foundation
[22:04] of the world
[22:05] and a man is a man and a woman is a
[22:07] woman yes
[22:08] and he took the woman out of the man and
[22:11] he put the feminist spirit
[22:13] from him into the woman so now he's a
[22:16] flesh body masculine spirit
[22:20] she is a flesh body feminine
[22:23] spirit you understand that was the
[22:26] beginning
[22:27] that was the type of jesus
[22:31] christ coming and and pouring himself
[22:34] into his bride
[22:35] where did this bride come from my friend
[22:38] where did this bride come from this
[22:41] bride came from
[22:43] jesus christ yes who is christ christ is
[22:46] the word
[22:48] amen at calvary
[22:51] god took that woman out of that man
[22:55] god took that bride out of that out of
[22:58] that word
[22:59] out of christ and when jesus ascended on
[23:03] high he sent back the holy spirit
[23:06] the spirit of god to put in each one of
[23:09] us
[23:09] yes oh can we see now
[23:13] what god does what he does people say oh
[23:15] we don't listen to the old testament
[23:17] anymore oh it's so perfectly types and
[23:19] shadows the new testament
[23:20] if we just wouldn't do away with it and
[23:22] just get a spiritual understanding of it
[23:25] yeah get a revelation of what the word
[23:27] is teaching us and telling us
[23:30] god did the exact same thing when he did
[23:32] without him and took the bride out of
[23:34] adam
[23:34] yeah he took a bride out of christ he
[23:37] took the spirit of feminine out of adam
[23:39] and put it in eve
[23:41] god took his holy spirit and he put it
[23:43] in his bride
[23:44] and that holy spirit from the day of
[23:46] pentecost has been flowing down through
[23:49] these church edges that is ever present
[23:51] now
[23:51] more than it ever has been amen yes and
[23:54] it's in us
[23:55] yes the holy spirit is in us it has made
[23:57] us who we are
[23:58] it is made us complete amen the only way
[24:02] that you become
[24:03] word is that you came out of christ
[24:06] that you are filled with his spirit that
[24:09] makes you
[24:09] word amen you understand that makes you
[24:14] word right yes and god is only coming in
[24:16] a rapture
[24:17] for a word bride right
[24:20] you have to have come from him from the
[24:23] beginning
[24:24] that's that part of god that seed that
[24:26] laid in there
[24:27] dormant from before the foundation of
[24:29] the world
[24:30] first john 3 and that seed that
[24:33] remaineth in there is the seed of god
[24:35] and when the word of god in literal
[24:37] spoken form comes
[24:39] and fertilizes that seed it produces
[24:42] life
[24:43] yes what kind of life does it produce it
[24:46] produces the life of the seed that's
[24:48] within it
[24:50] whatever life is in that seed is what
[24:52] it's going to produce
[24:53] yeah some of you here garden or grow
[24:55] flowers or plants or whatever
[24:57] uh brother dennis got a beautiful yard
[24:59] sister pat and them
[25:01] and bro grow beautiful plants and maybe
[25:04] from seedlings seedlings you
[25:05] you have a seed and you may look at a
[25:08] seed you may not know what it is but you
[25:09] put a little water to it and put it in
[25:11] the right kind of condition
[25:12] and it'll bring forth whatever's inside
[25:15] it
[25:16] if there's a seed in you you put it in
[25:18] the right condition and bring your
[25:19] little fertilizer a little
[25:21] uh water the holy spirit the word coming
[25:23] it'll bring that seed to life
[25:25] and when that seed comes life into you
[25:27] it only produces one thing
[25:29] that's what the seed is yes if the seed
[25:32] is god it's going to produce god
[25:35] if it's from the word from the beginning
[25:37] it's that's what it's going to produce
[25:39] and that word now is preeminent in you
[25:43] which makes you a word bride that's
[25:46] where the relationship comes from
[25:48] it's not just reading your bibles i'm
[25:51] not against reading the bible you know
[25:53] better than that
[25:54] right anybody may be watching you should
[25:56] read it every day i'm not against
[25:57] reading your bible you should read your
[25:59] bible
[25:59] but don't read it for knowledge yes
[26:02] right
[26:02] pray that god reveal that word to you
[26:05] pray that word
[26:06] fertilize that spirit that's like this
[26:09] within you
[26:10] and let it cultivate itself and let you
[26:13] die so that that life lives more in you
[26:16] let less of newton bennett live so more
[26:18] of jesus christ can live through you
[26:20] so then you can go out in this world and
[26:22] people can look
[26:24] and see it was written epistles read of
[26:26] all men
[26:27] read and known of all men right it's not
[26:29] an accident that that man looked at
[26:31] brother dennis and thought he was a man
[26:33] of god
[26:33] right that's not an accident and that's
[26:36] just one testimony probably of many and
[26:38] maybe some that you've had
[26:40] that look at you and say oh that that's
[26:42] a christian
[26:43] amen that's good probably further and
[26:46] further away because
[26:47] a lot of times people look and just they
[26:49] don't realize what it is
[26:51] yeah they just see you as a freak or
[26:53] something they don't realize it's god
[26:55] that's uh that that's living in you and
[26:57] through you they don't because they
[26:58] don't recognize that spirit
[27:00] the people have gotten in the in the
[27:02] world economy has gotten so far away
[27:04] from the spirit of god
[27:05] that they don't even recognize him when
[27:07] they see it but we know
[27:09] and there's some still out there they
[27:11] see it and they know
[27:13] they they see us and they recognize
[27:16] there's something different
[27:18] they may not even say anything but
[27:19] there's people they know
[27:21] they recognize it that's right why
[27:23] because you're written epistles read and
[27:25] known of all men
[27:26] because that life that's coming through
[27:28] you that word that's living through you
[27:31] you say well i feel like the same person
[27:33] that doesn't matter
[27:34] it's not i'm not talking about your
[27:36] human flesh or your human flesh
[27:38] your human flesh is going to obey the
[27:40] word too
[27:42] you don't live just however you want to
[27:44] you don't dress just how you want to go
[27:46] wherever you want to
[27:48] your human flesh comes under subjection
[27:50] to the word
[27:51] right amen but it's not that
[27:54] it's the man that's on the inside yes
[27:57] amen
[27:58] the life that's on the inside is what
[28:00] will dictate to the outside
[28:02] that makes that bride a word bride
[28:06] amen look now and the scene is not there
[28:09] with the shock
[28:10] i got some just some really powerful
[28:12] quotes i want to read to you here
[28:15] that's what the church is doing today
[28:18] for jesus
[28:19] is the word and he is the bridegroom
[28:23] and the bride is a part of the groom
[28:26] now there's going to be a transition
[28:29] here that i don't
[28:30] want you to miss because i want you to
[28:33] see in the progression
[28:35] of a relationship uh
[28:38] again that we talked about that relation
[28:40] there's a progression of a relationship
[28:44] when uh i hope
[28:48] well i hope i do offend people if you
[28:50] see it a different way
[28:51] but when a boy and a girl meet
[28:55] uh there's something that sparks
[28:59] and they have a relationship it may be a
[29:02] casual relationship
[29:03] maybe a conversation relationship it may
[29:06] be
[29:07] uh what is it now face
[29:10] timing or whatever they do i i don't
[29:13] know
[29:14] but face timing or uh
[29:17] i don't know what video anyway video
[29:19] chat
[29:20] uh whatever and they may have a little
[29:22] uh a superficial
[29:24] relationship but it's a relationship
[29:26] they're getting to know one another
[29:28] and then all of a sudden they decide hey
[29:30] i want to be your girlfriend well that's
[29:32] good because i want to be your boyfriend
[29:34] now we've got titles to the relationship
[29:37] we got a boyfriend and we got a
[29:38] girlfriend
[29:39] so we got tiles amen i i want to
[29:43] i am proud to introduce uh what it was
[29:46] at that time
[29:47] my wife now as my girlfriend i was proud
[29:50] of that
[29:51] i was happy to be able to introduce uh
[29:54] my sonia to
[29:55] as my girlfriend that meant a lot to me
[29:57] i was happy to do that
[29:59] i don't know how she felt but i was
[30:02] happy
[30:02] i was proud she was my girlfriend it was
[30:04] a title to it see
[30:06] because there was a relationship change
[30:09] and as the relationship
[30:10] continued to grow and we got closer and
[30:13] closer
[30:14] and we got more like each other and
[30:16] became more i guess you'd say in love
[30:19] as that relationship grew to a state of
[30:21] love
[30:22] i asked her to marry me oh that changed
[30:25] the relationship even more
[30:27] now she's my fiance and as much as i
[30:31] enjoyed calling my girlfriend
[30:33] i really enjoyed calling her my fiance i
[30:36] never got used to that word i guess
[30:37] that's french isn't it
[30:39] anyway it just didn't roll off the
[30:40] tongue but i enjoyed saying it anyway
[30:43] amen she's my fiance the only thing i
[30:46] don't like about fiance is
[30:48] it's a fiance with your boy or girl i
[30:50] was her fiance she was my fiance so
[30:53] there's no designation of masculine or
[30:54] feminine to that
[30:55] phrase but a relationship change which
[30:58] is the point i'm trying to make
[31:00] our relationship unfolded our
[31:02] relationship continued to grow
[31:04] and we put different titles on our
[31:06] relationship we were now
[31:07] not just boyfriend and girlfriend we
[31:09] were fiances
[31:11] we were we were we were engaged
[31:15] we were she had a ring as little as it
[31:17] was she had one
[31:19] that showed that that we were engaged
[31:22] there was a promise
[31:23] there amen there was a promise there
[31:27] now on the day it came a time
[31:31] where we reached the day that she became
[31:34] my bride
[31:35] she was my bride and i was the
[31:37] bridegroom
[31:39] we stood there in a church with a
[31:41] ceremony that was about to take place
[31:43] and some of our closest friends
[31:45] a pastor i didn't even know but anyway
[31:48] uh
[31:48] we were there to to join ourselves
[31:52] together
[31:53] she was my bride i was her bridegroom
[31:56] our relationship had changed even more
[31:59] it had grown to a place from just casual
[32:02] meeting of her saying hey i like your
[32:03] voice
[32:04] to the place of me asking her to marry
[32:06] me and becoming fiancee to now
[32:08] being on our day of marriage
[32:11] on the day of marriage she's my bride
[32:14] amen and i'm her bridegroom
[32:17] and that's what the title is it evolved
[32:19] even more
[32:20] it changed the title changed
[32:24] then we stood there in front of the
[32:26] front of the pastor
[32:28] and the pastor said to you and she said
[32:31] yes
[32:32] he looked at me and he said to you and i
[32:34] said yes
[32:35] and he said i now pronounce you husband
[32:39] and wife our relationship had changed
[32:42] again
[32:44] right she wasn't my bride although we
[32:47] could still interchangeably use
[32:49] bride and wife she was now my wife
[32:53] when i introduced her i didn't introduce
[32:55] her we we went to copper queen
[32:57] uh hotel in bisbee for our wedding night
[33:00] and when we got to the hotel we looked
[33:01] like we were 12.
[33:03] i mean we had every paper in the book to
[33:05] prove that we were who we were
[33:06] that she was legal and that we were of
[33:09] age and area we had our marriage
[33:11] certificate and
[33:12] everything we took everything possible
[33:14] because we looked like we were 12 or 14
[33:15] years old
[33:16] but we went to the compromise i didn't
[33:18] introduce her
[33:20] to the people at the registration desk
[33:22] as my bride i introduced her as my wife
[33:25] because we had changed the dispensation
[33:27] we had changed our relationships
[33:30] our relationship had gotten to where we
[33:32] were now
[33:33] married amen she was my wife
[33:38] and i was her husband now the
[33:40] relationship
[33:41] grew to a place to where it was more
[33:45] intimate than it had ever been it was to
[33:47] an
[33:48] ultimate place of relationship and
[33:51] intimacy
[33:52] than it could ever be legally
[33:57] legally by by the world standards and by
[33:59] god
[34:00] right amen and my god i promised myself
[34:03] to her
[34:05] she promised herself to me and we became
[34:07] one
[34:08] yes she became flesh in my flesh
[34:11] bone of my bone and the two of us become
[34:15] one flesh
[34:16] now our relationship had reached its
[34:18] pinnacle it had reached an
[34:20] apex amen of of relationship between man
[34:24] and wife
[34:26] well how do you see that relationship as
[34:29] being
[34:29] any different than when you
[34:31] [Music]
[34:33] got your first relationship with jesus
[34:36] christ
[34:37] matisse talked about this man today he
[34:40] probably may have i don't know it just
[34:42] got his first glimpse
[34:43] into recognizing he needed jesus in his
[34:46] life
[34:47] and a lot of people do that my billy
[34:50] graham went around the world how many
[34:52] times
[34:53] getting thousands to an altar to say i
[34:55] accept
[34:56] jesus right but did the relationship end
[35:00] there
[35:01] or did it continue to grow right i mean
[35:03] the lord only knows of course
[35:05] but the relationship had to grow you you
[35:09] you can't be a part of christ but just
[35:11] saying i accept you lord
[35:13] there's more to it there's got to be an
[35:15] acceptance
[35:16] back if i had stood there and said yes i
[35:20] will take her as my wife
[35:21] and she says no i won't take him as my
[35:24] husband we would have stopped right
[35:25] there we would have never been married
[35:28] we'd have never gotten married amen
[35:31] because the commitment's not there the
[35:33] dedication is not there the sincerity
[35:35] the love
[35:36] not there and a lot of people do that
[35:39] they get to that place
[35:40] they might even get to a threshold but
[35:42] then they won't take jesus
[35:44] in all that it comes with knowing him
[35:48] in that relationship they won't take him
[35:50] they take to know him
[35:51] through a bible or through a church
[35:54] through a denomination through a pastor
[35:56] but they won't come to know jesus
[35:58] themselves
[36:00] that's how you see so many loose lives
[36:02] and people living the way they do
[36:05] people going to message churches and
[36:06] just living all kind of way doing
[36:08] whatever they want and how they want to
[36:10] show up and pay the tithes to come to
[36:12] church be a church member
[36:13] church member doesn't make you bride
[36:15] friend church member doesn't make you
[36:17] the wife of jesus christ
[36:19] that's right amen got to be more to it
[36:22] than that
[36:23] there's got to be a relation it's got to
[36:24] be intimacy
[36:26] there's got to be commitment there's got
[36:29] to be coming to a place to where you
[36:31] know that person unlike anybody else
[36:34] in the world i know my wife like any
[36:38] like no other person in the world and
[36:40] nobody knows her like i do
[36:43] and nobody knows me like she does i
[36:46] don't know if that's good or bad but
[36:47] nobody like knows me like she does
[36:51] and that's just and and it's the same
[36:54] relationship as we have with christ we
[36:56] don't have a courtyard relationship
[37:00] we don't even have an an interval
[37:02] relationship
[37:03] we have a holies of holies relationship
[37:06] right
[37:06] amen we're not out in the in the outer
[37:09] court or the inner court
[37:11] look for him when it comes to the
[37:13] tabernacle in the wilderness with the
[37:15] with the children of israel they had to
[37:17] have a relationship of someone
[37:20] that entered into the holies of holies
[37:22] right
[37:23] for that true god relationship together
[37:26] between
[37:27] the the bride and the bridegroom right
[37:31] back then unfortunately there was only
[37:33] one man that could go back there
[37:35] right amen but when the when the veil of
[37:38] the temple was written twain at calvary
[37:40] god opened himself and sent his spirit
[37:43] back on
[37:43] all of us right now we don't have to
[37:46] rule out a priest
[37:47] we don't have to rely on a pastor we
[37:49] don't have to rely on a pope for some
[37:51] uh denomination we ourselves can enter
[37:54] into that holy place
[37:55] yes we ourselves can enter into that
[37:58] godly place
[37:59] in that relationship with jesus christ
[38:02] that we can know him and he will know us
[38:05] yes amen it's not like the rest of the
[38:08] world friend
[38:09] it's not like those that just say oh i'm
[38:10] a christian no it's a relationship
[38:13] it's that godly husband and wife
[38:17] relationship see down through the ages
[38:20] there was that relationship bride and
[38:22] groom bride and groom and we call it
[38:23] bride all the time friend
[38:25] but that relationship has changed
[38:27] dispensations
[38:29] we'll get to that maybe today maybe not
[38:32] but look jesus is the word
[38:36] and he is the bridegroom and the bride
[38:40] is a part of the groom the brightest
[38:42] part of the groom you believe that
[38:44] therefore the word that is to be
[38:46] fulfilled this day
[38:48] is the same part of the word that was
[38:50] fulfilled in his day
[38:51] and it's the same word same experience
[38:54] same life
[38:56] for when god separated adam he was both
[38:59] we find out
[39:00] adam was spirit to begin with now we've
[39:03] explained all this just a moment ago but
[39:05] let
[39:05] bear with me a moment as i read this
[39:08] adam's spirit to begin with he made man
[39:11] in his own
[39:12] image created he male and female
[39:15] genesis 2 he created man out of the dust
[39:18] of the earth
[39:19] man was created in god's image and god
[39:21] is a spirit so he's a spirit man
[39:25] then when he become flesh man animal
[39:28] flesh
[39:28] on earth he is showing portraying here
[39:32] the bride amen amen
[39:35] she he is there portraying that bride
[39:39] yes because that bride was in her
[39:42] yes oh if you listen that invisible
[39:44] union brother branham goes so deep into
[39:46] helping us
[39:46] understand the predestination of god
[39:50] and recognizing just in the physical
[39:52] element of it
[39:53] and we talked about last week back to my
[39:54] dad and grandpa and great-grandpa
[39:57] my great-grandfather didn't know michael
[39:59] was in there
[40:01] but he was there was a day 35 years ago
[40:05] i didn't know he was in there
[40:07] but the relationship batting ground
[40:11] and intimacy a son came forth
[40:15] it was manifested it showed that he was
[40:18] always there even in my great great
[40:21] grandfather he was there
[40:24] didn't know it but he was still there
[40:26] the predestination of god
[40:28] yeah how is that any different than the
[40:31] spirit life friend
[40:32] the spiritual life of god is the same
[40:34] way
[40:35] back in before the foundation of the
[40:38] world
[40:39] the gene of god that was in his mind was
[40:42] what was to be manifested upon this
[40:44] earth which is the bride of jesus christ
[40:46] which you all claim to be a part of
[40:50] including myself yes that gene seed of
[40:53] life that god put
[40:54] in you was to be you before the
[40:57] foundation of the world
[40:58] right yes amen what is that part of god
[41:04] that part of god that god pulled out of
[41:06] himself
[41:08] and placed in you just like he did adam
[41:12] just like he did jesus amen the word
[41:16] she is the word amen
[41:20] portraying hear the bride listen now he
[41:23] never taken and made another being
[41:26] but he took part of adam the original
[41:29] creation
[41:31] took from him a rib from his side and
[41:33] took the feminist spirit out of adam
[41:36] left the masculine spirit in there and
[41:38] placed it in the feminist part
[41:41] the woman amen therefore
[41:44] part of his spirit part of his body
[41:46] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[41:48] word of his word life of his life and
[41:50] that's the way the bride
[41:52] is to christ the bride is to
[41:56] christ flesh of his flesh bone of his
[41:59] bone
[42:00] word of his word life of his life spirit
[42:03] of his spirit
[42:04] amen she's one with him yes amen
[42:08] now me and my wife we didn't become one
[42:12] when we were a casual relationship
[42:15] just to know her know her name know my
[42:18] name
[42:19] not even boyfriend girlfriend or fiance
[42:24] it was when we entered into that bond of
[42:26] matrimony
[42:27] that that that place of of of
[42:30] intimacy that you can only have
[42:34] in that relationship with that
[42:35] relationship oh
[42:37] people can can perform the act all the
[42:40] time
[42:40] but that doesn't make an intimate
[42:42] relationship right
[42:44] just having a a a a performing an act
[42:47] doesn't
[42:48] doesn't create an intimate relationship
[42:51] but i'm talking about that
[42:52] intimate relationship word of his
[42:56] word life of his life spirit of the
[42:58] spirit she's
[42:59] him amen she is him
[43:04] that's the way the bride is to christ
[43:06] that's the way we are to him today
[43:08] that's why it takes this word that's why
[43:10] it takes this message
[43:12] that's why it took each ages message to
[43:15] call out a bride to jesus christ
[43:18] yes that's why down all through those
[43:20] church ages
[43:21] every one of those that died in christ
[43:23] shall he bring with him
[43:25] yes and we are a library man will be
[43:27] caught up with them to meet the lord in
[43:29] the air
[43:29] yes praise the lord
[43:33] we're all sane we have to be
[43:36] that's why it's an international bribe
[43:38] it's not an asian bride
[43:40] it's not a russian bride it's not a
[43:44] a an egyptian bride an african bride a
[43:46] europe bride and a united states bride
[43:50] it's an international bride of jesus
[43:53] christ
[43:54] well if it's going to be international
[43:56] it's got to be on the same basis
[43:58] it's got to follow the same pattern or
[44:01] it's not the same
[44:02] not to god she is to him
[44:06] amen that's why the rapture of the royal
[44:09] seed has to come first the rest of the
[44:11] dead
[44:12] live not a thousand years then they were
[44:14] brought up to the white throne judgment
[44:16] see there is no judgment to the royal
[44:18] seed or the predestinated seed
[44:20] of abraham amen list this now
[44:24] christ revealed in his own word
[44:28] different message now now the next thing
[44:31] happens is when it's all gathered up
[44:34] into that one person
[44:36] i've had these people that i've dealt
[44:37] with for many years of
[44:40] 1963 and all the things that took place
[44:43] and
[44:46] you know all the things that they talk
[44:47] about christ is here and
[44:51] that's the return of the lord or people
[44:53] that are millennials and
[44:55] there's people out there that believe
[44:56] we're in the millennium now
[44:58] we've gone past all these things we're
[45:00] already in the millennium scene
[45:02] because they failed to see and place the
[45:05] scripture appropriately
[45:07] where it belongs for us for this day
[45:10] brother brown said the next thing that
[45:13] happens
[45:15] so what are we looking for amen are we
[45:18] looking for
[45:18] any all these other things what are we
[45:20] looking for
[45:21] amen because that's valuable yes what
[45:23] we're looking for that's valuable that
[45:25] means something to us because that that
[45:27] shows what our heart is
[45:28] that shows where our mind is where our
[45:30] heart is amen what are you thinking
[45:32] about what are you looking for
[45:34] see he says the next thing is when it's
[45:37] all gathered up into that one person
[45:40] jesus christ
[45:42] bride and body at the physical
[45:46] return of the lord jesus now tell me how
[45:48] 63 fits that
[45:51] anyway i'll move on making his three
[45:53] times when he was brought there or
[45:55] killed crucifies rape
[45:56] crucified and raised up manifesting
[45:59] himself
[46:00] in the form of his body which is the
[46:02] bride the woman
[46:03] he should get it she is part of his body
[46:06] the woman and man is just look look at
[46:09] this now
[46:10] brother brown punches it down just right
[46:12] exactly to the
[46:13] the to that relationship here listen
[46:17] the woman and the man is just so close
[46:19] together
[46:20] till they're almost the same then he
[46:22] pauses
[46:24] dot dot dot he says they are
[46:28] the same yes they ought to be
[46:32] anyhow which means they are going to be
[46:36] or they are now i mean how close are we
[46:39] yes okay i mean that really lays it down
[46:42] for us
[46:42] how close are we how close really are we
[46:45] to a rapture
[46:47] amen people get their eyes on everything
[46:48] else around oh the bride's not ready but
[46:51] how do you know the bride's not ready
[46:52] well these people fussing these people
[46:54] over here doing this and i'm not
[46:55] responsible for those people
[46:56] i don't know those people are bright i
[46:58] believe a lot of the people i
[47:00] that you know that they are and that's
[47:03] great but i
[47:04] i don't know that my focus is only on
[47:06] what the lord's put in my life to where
[47:08] i believe god is calling
[47:10] yes and if god's doing that same thing
[47:12] there's a there's an elected lady
[47:14] that's sitting out there around the
[47:15] world that feels the same way
[47:17] that pole is getting stronger and
[47:19] stronger yes amen
[47:21] the road signs are out there we see the
[47:23] road signs of course those are very
[47:24] evident
[47:25] but greater than that that pole is
[47:27] getting greater and greater
[47:28] see that's that pull god pulling his
[47:31] bride
[47:32] don't you think that enoch had that what
[47:34] that before he left
[47:35] yes don't you think and i felt that pull
[47:37] too
[47:38] as he walked and had a testimony that
[47:40] pleased the lord
[47:42] enoch hadn't felt that pull pulling on
[47:45] him
[47:45] to one day he got so close to god god
[47:47] said you're close to my home yard of
[47:49] yours just come on home
[47:50] yes yep well don't you feel that pull
[47:53] yes
[47:54] hey man friend i gotta tell you
[47:57] i don't i don't feel just completely
[48:00] disconnected from this world and country
[48:01] today
[48:02] i feel such a pull of the lord yes i
[48:05] just don't see how much longer it can be
[48:07] yes amen so what is it what is it then
[48:10] at that point
[48:10] when brother brown says they are the
[48:12] same he said they ought to be anyhow so
[48:15] what does that mean to us
[48:18] she's the word she is a word bride and
[48:21] the two have become one
[48:23] flesh and flesh bone upon that's our
[48:25] relationship with christ
[48:27] praise the lord amen
[48:31] so close it ought to be anyhow see there
[48:33] you are it's exactly the manifested time
[48:36] she is a part of him because she was
[48:38] taken out from him
[48:39] and the bride today is taken out of the
[48:42] body of christ
[48:43] which is acting and doing just exactly
[48:46] like he said it would for this day
[48:48] the bride the queen the king and the
[48:51] queen
[48:52] just exactly the way the word said it
[48:54] would be is
[48:55] exactly the way god is performing it and
[48:58] causing it to be in our lives in the
[49:00] world today that's why you feel the way
[49:03] you do that's why you
[49:04] you see things the way you do and god
[49:06] revealing himself
[49:08] and that pull that's taking place amen
[49:10] because you feel it
[49:12] yes because you know the relationship is
[49:14] there
[49:15] i feel that pull when you have that
[49:17] relationship naturally friend you feel
[49:19] that pull
[49:20] you feel that urge you feel that that
[49:22] feeling that god put in
[49:24] in each one of us ain't meant to be able
[49:27] to
[49:27] feel that relationship amen
[49:32] when i when me and my wife got married i
[49:35] i had a pull to want to become one with
[49:37] her
[49:38] amen it was it was inherent it was
[49:40] something god put in there
[49:42] he missed god put that in every human uh
[49:45] a lot of times in the world it's
[49:47] perverted into a lust but god put that
[49:50] in everyone
[49:51] but it was something special about it
[49:53] was there was no other woman around
[49:55] there
[49:55] there was no other woman that i'd seen
[49:57] or in the world
[49:58] that i wanted to to feel the pull to
[50:01] have that relationship that intimacy
[50:04] well friend if it's that way in the
[50:06] physical what do you think it is with
[50:07] god in the spiritual
[50:09] with his bride with this word bride to
[50:12] have that relationship
[50:13] and what should be the feeling we have
[50:16] about it amen
[50:17] oh my friend shouldn't there be such a
[50:20] pull
[50:21] yes such a because god put that in
[50:24] there
[50:25] yeah just like the physical god put that
[50:28] spiritual in his bride
[50:29] to fill that pool to feel that yearning
[50:33] for that relationship with
[50:35] jesus yeah oh that intimacy with the
[50:38] lord yes
[50:40] there's something different about it
[50:42] something that
[50:43] separates it from every other
[50:45] relationship
[50:47] christ and his bride yes they become one
[50:50] we're together with him as one amen
[50:54] oh praise the lord that's where god took
[50:57] his
[50:58] uh spirit out and put it in the bride
[51:04] the two becoming one yes first
[51:07] corinthians
[51:09] chapter 12.
[51:13] let's read this first corinthians
[51:14] chapter 12 verse 12.
[51:21] um sometimes i get like brother branham
[51:23] said if i just had a little more voice
[51:25] i'd really tell you how it felt
[51:28] but it's so real friend it's so true
[51:30] it's so
[51:32] it and it's now so much of this so many
[51:36] times people
[51:37] try to put off in the future somewhere
[51:39] oh well it's going to be
[51:41] fair i want you to know if we're that
[51:42] close it is now
[51:45] it is here it is now it is not something
[51:49] we're looking
[51:50] for it is something that we have
[51:53] that we're enjoying right now
[51:56] we're enjoying saints we're enjoying an
[51:59] intimacy with the bridegroom
[52:01] like no other age has enjoyed
[52:04] we have the ability and the and the
[52:07] opportunity
[52:08] to have this relationship like no other
[52:10] age has been able to have
[52:12] because the fullness the fullness of the
[52:15] word has come
[52:16] the cover has been torn off the
[52:19] mysteries have been revealed
[52:21] christ has been exposed we can know him
[52:24] in the intimacy of who he is now
[52:27] oh and if that yearning is there
[52:30] physically
[52:31] what can that what should that yearning
[52:33] be for us spiritually
[52:34] amen amen first corinthians chapter 12
[52:37] verse 12
[52:40] for as the body is one and had many
[52:42] members
[52:43] and all the members of that one body
[52:45] being many are one body
[52:47] so also as christ
[52:50] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[52:54] into one body whether we be jews or
[52:57] gentiles whether we be bond or free and
[52:59] have been
[53:00] all made to drink into one spirit
[53:05] for the one for the body is not
[53:08] is not one member but many
[53:12] so it's not me myself and i
[53:15] it is a many member body around the
[53:18] world
[53:19] from the first church age making up the
[53:22] body of jesus christ
[53:24] we're all one with him we're one with
[53:28] each other and we're one with him
[53:31] thus the bride body
[53:35] when it is that time when that time come
[53:38] to say i do you did
[53:43] internationally yeah you think about
[53:47] what brother branham talked about
[53:49] if you haven't listened to it just just
[53:51] briefly it's already 12 o'clock
[53:53] just briefly
[53:57] when brother branham talked about
[53:59] american uh excuse me again invisible
[54:01] union
[54:03] the whole point of brother branham
[54:04] talking about invisible union
[54:06] you understand let's look at jesus for a
[54:10] moment maybe i'm getting a little deeper
[54:11] than i want to for today but maybe
[54:14] we can into next week
[54:20] just think about this this way for a
[54:22] moment
[54:25] with that relationship
[54:29] because if if the body's one
[54:33] then the body comes together all at the
[54:36] same time
[54:38] one part of the body isn't saying no
[54:41] and another part of the body saying yes
[54:45] one other part of the one part of the
[54:46] body isn't saying i don't
[54:48] and the other part of the body is saying
[54:50] i do the whole body is
[54:53] one is coming together as one
[54:56] an invisible union you see the
[54:59] you see the parables of jesus
[55:02] you know in the parables of jesus and i
[55:04] like to use
[55:06] saint john 6 a lot but when
[55:09] jesus tried to talk to them
[55:12] he talked to them in parables and then
[55:15] he tried to talk to them directly
[55:17] and they still couldn't understand what
[55:19] he was saying right
[55:20] they still didn't grasp or have a
[55:22] spiritual understanding of what jesus
[55:24] was trying to tell them
[55:25] even when he broke it down and said
[55:27] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[55:29] blood you have no part of me
[55:31] they didn't understand that right
[55:33] without spiritual understanding
[55:34] you won't people read that in the bible
[55:38] and think that this
[55:39] whole religion is a bunch of cannibalism
[55:41] or something vampires
[55:43] they won't understand it without
[55:45] spiritual revelation understanding
[55:47] you'll not get it
[55:48] so jesus spoke to have been parables all
[55:50] the time
[55:52] and they didn't understand they didn't
[55:54] get it
[55:55] how many times did brother brett did god
[55:57] allowed brother ram to do the exact same
[55:58] thing
[55:59] right brother bam didn't come to us and
[56:01] say this is what i'm doing
[56:03] he preached amer he preached the
[56:04] marriage and divorce
[56:06] he preached an invisible union now the
[56:09] title in itself ought to tell you
[56:10] exactly what he's trying to say
[56:12] but then he goes into marriage and
[56:14] divorce and he talks about living
[56:17] husbands living wives and
[56:18] and all about marriage and divorce he
[56:20] explains you know it sounds a lot like
[56:22] marriage and divorce and so on
[56:23] but he said i want to take a greater
[56:25] application
[56:26] and i want to talk about the spiritual
[56:28] application of
[56:30] christ and his bride and then he goes to
[56:33] talk about
[56:34] you have to be dead to your first
[56:36] husband
[56:37] before you could ever be married to
[56:40] jesus christ the word
[56:42] now how profound it is
[56:46] with the understanding of what he's
[56:47] trying to say without a spiritual
[56:50] understanding
[56:50] you're not gonna understand that whole
[56:52] parable message
[56:54] but what he's telling us is that if you
[56:57] were born in sin shaped he could become
[56:59] the world's speaking lives in other
[57:00] words you're a human
[57:02] you had to die to that first husband yes
[57:05] that first husband has to die
[57:07] and rot and be gone before you could
[57:09] ever think about marrying christ the
[57:11] word
[57:12] yes now he draws it down to
[57:14] denominations
[57:15] oh you can't be married to a
[57:16] denomination friend you can't be married
[57:18] to anyone
[57:19] but the word yes denomination
[57:23] i mean denominations in this message we
[57:25] know that a pastor
[57:28] a church kingdom a minister amen
[57:32] whoever it is there's got to be a
[57:35] death of separation from that before you
[57:38] can do what
[57:40] be married to christ the word
[57:44] amen amen this bride is one
[57:48] yes she's come together as one to be in
[57:51] union
[57:52] together with christ the word
[57:56] listen let me read these couple because
[57:58] i got to close here
[58:00] in the rapture message look what brother
[58:02] aaron says about this bride
[58:03] this uh the bride now
[58:06] when a germ comes into the female he
[58:09] said
[58:09] you didn't become look now you didn't
[58:12] become a human germ from your father
[58:15] and then the next thing you become a
[58:16] germ from a dog
[58:18] and the next thing from a cat and the
[58:20] next thing from a chicken
[58:22] because he's talking about the building
[58:24] of that human
[58:26] the cell that come in there that
[58:28] germline seed broke open
[58:31] it produced the light that was in it and
[58:34] then that life
[58:35] produces cell on top of cell on top of
[58:38] cell on top of cell
[58:39] to produce the life that was in the seed
[58:42] that come out into the form of a human
[58:44] being
[58:45] you look at an early ultrasound today
[58:48] and it looks like a little
[58:50] pinto bean or something a lima bean
[58:54] but once the cell on sale on cell
[58:56] continues to create itself
[58:58] it starts getting arms legs and head
[59:02] and it starts looking like a human right
[59:04] now if it was a dog or a cat
[59:06] the cell of that dog or cat would start
[59:09] sell on cell and cell and then it would
[59:10] look like a cat
[59:12] have paws look like a dog claws and
[59:15] teeth
[59:16] and it would start developing itself as
[59:18] that seed was brother graham's saying
[59:20] that seed didn't come forth as a human
[59:22] cell and then the next cell was a dog
[59:24] cell
[59:25] right or the next cell was a cat cell
[59:27] the next cell was a chicken cell or
[59:30] a horse cell no it was all human cell
[59:34] what did that human sell on top of cell
[59:36] on top of cell create
[59:37] a human being amen
[59:41] a viable living breathing human being
[59:45] now what about the spiritual body
[59:48] he said next thing you know he said it's
[59:51] not a dog or
[59:52] just dog cat chicken it was all human
[59:54] germ
[59:56] and the body of jesus christ the bride
[59:59] will be a part of his body which he was
[1:00:02] the word
[1:00:04] and the bride will have to be the word
[1:00:07] word on top of word added to word on top
[1:00:10] of word
[1:00:11] right that's the only way it would
[1:00:13] produce a word bride
[1:00:16] it's not come forth and a seed as
[1:00:18] observed from the lord
[1:00:20] and then all of a sudden comes another
[1:00:22] seed of
[1:00:24] a baptism and then there comes a a
[1:00:27] methodist cell
[1:00:28] and and then here's a catholic cell and
[1:00:31] and then all of a sudden you got a
[1:00:32] you got a message cell and and and then
[1:00:34] you got
[1:00:35] you oh friend if that baby was ever born
[1:00:37] it'd be so deformed
[1:00:39] look worse the elephant man yeah yes
[1:00:42] you got it because you got a denominator
[1:00:43] you got a method of seed a part of them
[1:00:45] and you got a
[1:00:46] baptist apartment a catholic and a
[1:00:48] message you got all these seeds growing
[1:00:50] on top of each other
[1:00:51] it's not going to look like the body of
[1:00:53] christ right right
[1:00:54] it's got to be word on top of word
[1:00:58] amen amen not tucson tabernacle not word
[1:01:02] of god tabernacle
[1:01:03] not brahms tabernacle word on top of
[1:01:05] word on top of word on top of word is
[1:01:08] what creates
[1:01:09] this body of christ known as the bride
[1:01:13] amen there's change
[1:01:16] i i've got to stop here because it's
[1:01:18] going to take me too long to get the
[1:01:19] rest of that
[1:01:20] that relationship i want you to listen
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] invisible union that relationship
[1:01:27] changed
[1:01:29] we were god's bride down through the
[1:01:31] ages
[1:01:32] amen all the way up through in the
[1:01:34] message brother brown
[1:01:37] and then there was a change the lord
[1:01:40] allowed brother branham to preach things
[1:01:41] like marriage of divorce and invisible
[1:01:43] union and
[1:01:44] mighty god unveiled and and the the
[1:01:46] course of seals which
[1:01:48] opened up the whole bible to us right
[1:01:50] and all these things that god allowed
[1:01:52] this prophet this last day
[1:01:54] to open up to this bride so that they
[1:01:56] could receive the revelation of that
[1:01:57] truth
[1:01:59] when she received the revelation that
[1:02:00] truth she became some that revel that
[1:02:03] that that relationship change
[1:02:07] remember real quick when john the
[1:02:09] baptist came to forerun the first coming
[1:02:10] of christ he said behold the lamb of god
[1:02:12] to take away the sin of the world
[1:02:14] that was a change of dispensation right
[1:02:17] that was a change
[1:02:18] he came out preaching repentance and
[1:02:20] baptizing people unto repentance
[1:02:22] but when christ came he said behold the
[1:02:24] lamb of god that was the purpose
[1:02:27] i was sitting here for this purpose and
[1:02:29] there he is
[1:02:31] everything changed john said i must
[1:02:33] decrease so that he will increase
[1:02:37] follow ye him and it all changed
[1:02:41] amen the whole relationship changed
[1:02:43] everything about it changed
[1:02:45] entered into a different relationship
[1:02:47] which now has changed and evolved
[1:02:50] up to the time as the bride of christ
[1:02:52] toward brother branham and god allowing
[1:02:54] him to preach those things down to that
[1:02:56] invisible union
[1:02:57] and choosing of a bride too in
[1:02:59] california by the way
[1:03:01] bringing out that bride to understand
[1:03:04] there's there's got to be a changing
[1:03:08] of of of relationship
[1:03:11] between christ and this bride yes to
[1:03:14] bring
[1:03:14] her and him together as one because
[1:03:18] she's going to produce something that
[1:03:20] she can only produce
[1:03:22] with a relationship with that intimate
[1:03:24] relationship with jesus christ
[1:03:26] she cannot produce it not what god's
[1:03:29] looking
[1:03:30] for she can't produce it as a methodist
[1:03:32] bride
[1:03:33] she can't produce it as a catholic bride
[1:03:35] or as a scientific or medical bride
[1:03:38] right she's got to be the bride of jesus
[1:03:40] christ
[1:03:42] that's the only way she can produce what
[1:03:44] god is looking for today
[1:03:46] yes only way
[1:03:49] so that relationship had to change amen
[1:03:53] an invisible union had to take place
[1:03:56] because we're going we're not going to a
[1:03:59] ceremony friend we're not going to a
[1:04:01] wedding
[1:04:02] we're going to a wedding supper a
[1:04:06] marriage supper a reception
[1:04:09] which is what after the marriage yes
[1:04:12] amen who is god coming for in this
[1:04:15] rapture
[1:04:15] he's coming for a word yes amen a word
[1:04:19] because she has become him yes amen
[1:04:22] let's stand if we could
[1:04:35] amen what as long as i thought
[1:04:42] amen so thankful god made the way
[1:04:46] for this to happen we didn't do it
[1:04:49] we just said yes lord and followed his
[1:04:51] path yes
[1:04:53] god just opened it up to us we said yes
[1:04:55] lord and just followed that
[1:04:57] just just followed that uh that leading
[1:05:00] that word amen and then god made it to
[1:05:03] us
[1:05:04] what he wanted to be in us amen

[1:06:09] of i believe it's where bro brown said
