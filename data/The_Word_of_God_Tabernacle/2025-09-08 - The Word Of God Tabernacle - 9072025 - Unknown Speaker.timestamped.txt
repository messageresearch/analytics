[40:24] only age where the token can be
[40:26] displayed, where the token be fully
[40:30] manifested in the lives of your people.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Help us.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Help us to recognize it. Give us eyesaff
[40:37] that we may see that if there's any sin
[40:41] that we will repent, Lord, knowing that
[40:45] if we confess our sins, you are faithful
[40:49] to us to forgive us of our sins. Cleans
[40:52] us from all unrighteous.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; If there's sin in our life, we can't
[40:57] even begin to pray for our precious
[40:59] loved ones. For you won't hear our
[41:01] prayers, Father, if iniquity dwells
[41:05] within us,
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are precious loved ones

[48:03] testimony on your heart this morning?
[48:06] Something I want to give praise to the
[48:07] Lord. Yes, Sister Julie,

[48:11] getting the truck fixed because it was a
[48:13] very large sum of money and um they were
[48:17] able to fix it in three days. I thank
[48:20] the Lord for providing the mechanic to
[48:22] do it. difficult finding a diesel
[48:24] mechanic. So, um I just I'm so happy to

[48:54] the second work week in a row I've been
[48:57] able to work on my job without any knee
[48:59] braces.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; I haven't put knee braces at all for the
[49:03] past two work weeks.

[49:48] Amen. God is good.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Anyone else in?
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm gonna give to the Lord. Um I

[50:04] Leah had an appointment the next day to
[50:06] see her and she missed her appointment
[50:09] by half an hour and they scheduled her
[50:12] December 9th. So she was very
[50:15] disappointed. she deals with depression,
[50:17] you know, and she got really down. I
[50:20] said, you know, God is more than able to
[50:23] make a way. So, I called the office and
[50:26] they told me they had no um
[50:30] cancellations, but I called every day.
[50:33] The second day I called, she got an
[50:35] appointment September 9th, this Tuesday.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; I give Oh, good. Wonderful. Praise the
[50:42] Lord.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Mine. Wonderful. God is good. Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's wonderful. Let's all stand
[50:48] to our feet then. Go to the Lord to the
[50:51] scripture.
[50:54] Going to go over to uh back to Romans
[50:57] chapter 8. Those few verses of scripture
[51:00] 14-17
[51:03] as we start in on uh adoption part 26.
[51:08] Amen. Adoption part 26. Going to speak
[51:12] on our inheritance today. Amen. We kind
[51:14] of delved into it just a smidge maybe
[51:18] last couple services, especially last
[51:20] service, but um I want to speak on our
[51:23] inheritance today that comes to us
[51:26] through this adoption. Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:14. Before we read the word
[51:30] though, let's bow our heads for a word
[51:31] of prayer if we could. Lord Jesus, so
[51:34] thankful again, Lord, as your for your
[51:36] word. Thank you for this time, Lord.
[51:38] Thank you for your blessings bringing us
[51:40] through the week, Lord. Yes. Lord, just
[51:42] a couple of the testimonies and so
[51:45] thankful, God, to know that you're ever
[51:46] present with us, Lord. You never leave
[51:48] us or forsake us. And knowing, God, that
[51:51] your hand is upon us, Lord, to lead us
[51:52] and guide us into your truths, into your
[51:55] words, into your pathways, Lord. We're
[51:58] just mere mortals, God. Expecting you,
[52:00] Lord, to continue to strengthen and help
[52:02] us along the way. We don't know the way.
[52:04] We don't know the journey, Lord. We
[52:06] don't know what's ahead of us, God, but
[52:08] we know who holds our hands. We know who
[52:10] has the the journey in hand, Lord, and
[52:13] is leading us and showing us every step
[52:16] at a way, every step at a time, God,
[52:18] along the way.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you, God, for uh for your uh
[52:23] word and for your people, Lord, for all
[52:25] that you've given and done for us. We're
[52:27] just so thankful for health and strength
[52:30] and life. Thankful for our brothers and
[52:32] sisters. Thankful, Lord, for the bride
[52:34] internationally. Lord, wherever they may
[52:36] be, whoever they are, God, we're all a
[52:38] part of the same family. We're all a
[52:40] part of the same body, Lord. And we just
[52:42] pray you'd bless each one, God. Keep us
[52:45] in your protective care. Watch over us.
[52:47] Take complete control now of the
[52:49] remaining part of this service as we
[52:50] commit it to you and minister to us from
[52:53] your word what you'd have us to see and
[52:54] know in that word today, God, knowing
[52:56] it'll not return void, but accomplish
[52:59] that in there, what you had sent it
[53:00] forth for today. Open my mouth to speak
[53:03] that thought liberally to that which you
[53:05] will want to be said, God, and close it
[53:07] to anything that would be your will not
[53:09] to be said, Father.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; We just want to be here to do according
[53:13] to whatever you would have for us to do.
[53:15] Let it be God unto us according to your
[53:18] will. That we ask these blessings in the
[53:20] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[53:22] Christ. Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:14.
[53:28] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[53:30] God, they are the sons of God. For you
[53:32] have not received the spirit of bondage
[53:34] again to fear, but you have received the
[53:36] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba,
[53:39] father. The spirit itself beareth
[53:41] witness with our spirit that we are the
[53:44] children of God and children than heirs.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, heirs are the people
[53:49] that get the inheritance, right?
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to be an heir to get an
[53:53] inheritance.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then heirs. Heirs of God. Joint
[53:57] hes with Christ. So that means that
[54:00] we're a joint with Christ. That what his
[54:02] inheritance is is our inheritance.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Just gets better
[54:07] and better, doesn't it? If so be that we
[54:10] suffer with him that we may be also
[54:12] glorified together. You can be seated if
[54:14] you'd like.
[54:16] Amen. on the inheritance. I want to go
[54:18] back and uh speak a little bit more uh
[54:21] back in Joshua and then uh back into
[54:25] Romans where we just read and Ephesians
[54:27] and tie some of that back together
[54:28] again. So, if we could go to Joshua,
[54:32] read from chapter 1. Just going to read
[54:34] a few verses of scripture so we
[54:37] understand and recognize the inheritance
[54:38] that they received. Uh the promise of
[54:41] God. Amen. The promise of God is the
[54:44] inheritance. what God promised us that
[54:47] is our inheritance.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the promise that God
[54:51] promised them, that he gave them from
[54:54] hundreds of years before, God was going
[54:57] to bring it to pass, recognizing that
[54:59] they had to fight and go through
[55:01] everything that we they went through
[55:03] from Abraham through Moses up to Joshua
[55:07] now and all the fighting and all the
[55:09] everything and the opposition and the
[55:11] battles that were won and the sea was
[55:14] crossed and the river that was crossed
[55:16] and everything that God done to bring
[55:18] them to the point of actually finally
[55:20] receiving their inheritance. Uh a lot of
[55:23] times it seems like that some Christians
[55:26] just want to receive this great
[55:27] inheritance and do nothing for it. Uh
[55:30] but there's a battle to be won. There's
[55:32] a life to be lived. There's an
[55:34] inheritance to inherit. Amen. To be an
[55:38] heir of God. It doesn't just come. Now,
[55:40] I know in normal life, if you're just a
[55:43] son, uh you're just born into the
[55:45] family. Of course, uh, a parent, even if
[55:48] you're a son or a daughter, a parent can
[55:50] write you out of their will. They don't
[55:52] have to leave you anything.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; You don't, even if you are an heir, they
[55:56] don't have to leave you anything as far
[55:58] as our normal uh, nominal human life
[56:02] goes. A parent doesn't have to leave a
[56:04] child anything if he doesn't want to, or
[56:07] just leave him a dollar, a porcelain
[56:10] figurine or something. They can leave
[56:12] them anything. Doesn't matter. They
[56:13] don't have to leave them anything,
[56:15] though. But when God promises something,
[56:18] that promise is our inheritance.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Every promise that God give us. Now, we
[56:23] are fortunately able to be able to
[56:25] obtain some of our inheritance now.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be able to get through this
[56:30] life because without the inheritance
[56:32] that we enjoy now, it would be nearly I
[56:35] I would say impossible for human flesh.
[56:38] That's why Jesus Christ came because
[56:40] human flesh couldn't live the law.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Right? So there would be no way without
[56:44] having received some of that inheritance
[56:46] now or as we'll read in a minute the
[56:49] earnest of our inheritance which we read
[56:51] last week I believe it was uh the
[56:54] earnest if without receiving some of
[56:56] that inheritance that God give us now
[56:58] how would a human ever make it through
[57:00] even to be a part of the body of Christ
[57:03] it would be impossible without God's
[57:05] help today saints none of us would make
[57:07] it
[57:08] &gt;&gt; there would be no way to make it amen
[57:10] without Jesus Christ coming and dying
[57:12] and shedding his blood and bringing
[57:14] these promises to life for us because he
[57:17] is the mediator. Amen. Without that,
[57:20] then none of us would have any hope. Uh
[57:23] even even back to where Adam and Eve uh
[57:26] when Adam and Eve fell all the way
[57:28] through. The only way they were even
[57:30] able to make it was because Jesus died
[57:33] uh went to hell, empty paradise, and
[57:35] brought him up with him. That's the only
[57:37] way they made it.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Well, if they're the only way they make
[57:40] it, then what is How's how are we going
[57:43] to make it in any other way?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; They came from back forward and went up
[57:47] and we're coming here and going up and
[57:49] we all go up together and be uh uh live
[57:52] eternally in the same place.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; But it's that inheritance that God gave
[57:56] us that promise that God gave us. Well,
[57:59] after all the fighting, after all the
[58:01] struggle, after all the battle, after
[58:04] all the fighting and struggling and and
[58:05] and uh all that the they had to go
[58:08] through to get to that place, they
[58:10] finally make that place. Even with God's
[58:13] help,
[58:15] even with God's help, they fought. Every
[58:18] inch of ground that they got,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; they still fought. Even with God's help,
[58:22] they fought through it. And they got to
[58:24] this place. We'll read here and then go
[58:27] back over uh to Romans, Ephesians, uh
[58:31] Joshua 1. We'll just read a couple
[58:33] verses 6-8. Be strong and of a good
[58:36] courage for unto this people shalt thou
[58:39] divide for an divide for an inheritance.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God gave them that
[58:46] inheritance. That was their promised
[58:48] land, their inheritance.
[58:51] Thou shalt divide. Now, see, it wasn't
[58:54] Joshua's responsibility to give them the
[58:57] inheritance. God had already done that.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It was Joshua's responsibility to take
[59:03] that inheritance and divide it out to
[59:06] the people.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So you, he says, be strong and of good
[59:10] courage. Unto this people, thou shalt
[59:12] divide for an inheritance the land which
[59:16] I swear unto their fathers to give them.
[59:19] So God had already done it. It was just
[59:21] Joshua's job to divide it out to them.
[59:24] Only be thou strong and very courageous.
[59:28] For thou mayest observe uh uh that thou
[59:31] mayest observe to do according to all
[59:33] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[59:36] thee. Turn not from it to the right hand
[59:39] or to the left, that thou mayest prosper
[59:42] whethersoever thou goest, which also is
[59:45] an inheritance, which which is also a
[59:48] promise.
[59:49] The prospering in God is a part of the
[59:52] promise of God that we are that we
[59:54] receive.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; The fact that we can be overcomers and
[1:00:00] claim to be overcomers is simply a
[1:00:03] promise of God.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; It's nothing we did
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; is simply the promise of God. We only
[1:00:09] overcome. We're only overcomers because
[1:00:12] of God's promise. Yeah,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; because of some of that now inheritance
[1:00:17] that we enjoy. Praise the Lord. As
[1:00:20] overcomers
[1:00:23] that and prospering whereversoever thou
[1:00:25] goest, this book of the law shall not
[1:00:28] depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
[1:00:31] meditate therein day and night. God help
[1:00:34] us, that thou mayest observe to do
[1:00:37] according to all that is written
[1:00:38] therein. For then thou shalt make thy
[1:00:41] way prosperous, and then thou ha shalt
[1:00:44] have good success. Praise the Lord. How?
[1:00:48] Why? We receive, we have good success
[1:00:52] based on the promise of God. We are able
[1:00:56] to continue to press forward because of
[1:00:58] the promise of God. We're only able
[1:01:01] again, like I said, to overcome because
[1:01:03] of the promise of God, because of the
[1:01:06] enjoyment that we have of that
[1:01:08] inheritance, being heirs of God. Praise
[1:01:12] the Lord. We enjoy that now because God
[1:01:15] because of what God has done for us, for
[1:01:18] what God has given us. Now, let's go
[1:01:20] over to Ephesians. See if we can't look
[1:01:22] at this, of course, and uh and bring it
[1:01:25] through from uh from that point in
[1:01:28] Romans that we just read.
[1:01:31] And look at this for again for a little
[1:01:33] bit on our inheritance. Uh our
[1:01:35] inheritance is a beautiful thing,
[1:01:37] saints.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful to God that he gives
[1:01:41] us this inheritance.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Notice not earned, given. It's been
[1:01:45] given to us.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Now, Ephesians chapter 1, we'll read
[1:01:53] verse 10, beginning with verse 10.
[1:01:57] Ephesians
[1:02:00] Ephesians 1:10.
[1:02:03] Amen.
[1:02:05] That in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:02:08] of times, he might gather together in
[1:02:11] one all things in Christ. All things.
[1:02:14] Again, we just talked about that coming
[1:02:16] from back forward. Everything, all is
[1:02:20] going to be in Christ. Everything around
[1:02:22] the world, every every believer around
[1:02:25] the world is going to be in under one
[1:02:27] oice. Christ. Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I talked about that at Sister Lydia's
[1:02:31] funeral. I hit on it a little bit last
[1:02:33] week. Amen. Where God's promise to those
[1:02:36] that have gone on before and those that
[1:02:37] are alive and remain, they're all going
[1:02:40] to be gathered together. And that and
[1:02:41] this message, this word that the Lord
[1:02:43] has brought us to. Amen. There can only
[1:02:46] be that one thing that we're under that
[1:02:48] we're a part of that we are uh uh
[1:02:50] gathering under that opus and that's
[1:02:52] that word that's that revealed word of
[1:02:55] the hour. It's that that God that
[1:02:57] promise that God has given us that we
[1:02:58] are that we are a part of today that we
[1:03:01] gather together under uh the Lord's even
[1:03:04] given us special language if you will
[1:03:06] that we speak that the world doesn't
[1:03:08] know. You could go to a nominal church
[1:03:11] and talk about a lot of the things and
[1:03:12] use some of the vernacular that we use
[1:03:15] uh in this message and those people
[1:03:17] probably would have no idea what you're
[1:03:19] talking about.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't understand that. I
[1:03:22] remember reading a little article. I I
[1:03:24] wasn't I was
[1:03:27] I had a little interest but not very
[1:03:29] much in all this uh uh uh what do they
[1:03:34] call it? this uh uh investigation
[1:03:38] into the bride, into the message, excuse
[1:03:41] me, into the message and into people
[1:03:43] that propagate the message or claim to
[1:03:46] be in the message and uh ministers that
[1:03:49] have probably not done exactly like
[1:03:52] maybe they should have or get in trouble
[1:03:54] with the law or something. Anyway, read
[1:03:56] an article about that. No calling any
[1:03:58] names. You probably all know it anyway.
[1:04:00] Uh but I read a little a little portion
[1:04:02] of an article that somebody had written
[1:04:04] about it. The headline was like, you
[1:04:07] know, uh uh the message and had a
[1:04:10] picture, I think even of Brother
[1:04:12] Brandham in it. And uh the the the
[1:04:14] verbiage started on like and they use
[1:04:17] verbiage like uh rapture and bride and
[1:04:22] uh uh seals and I forgot all the words
[1:04:25] that he used in there, but things that
[1:04:26] we that that you that become very a
[1:04:29] normal vernacular we use in the message
[1:04:32] that you don't hear anywhere else in the
[1:04:34] world.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Right. in in Christian anywhere. You
[1:04:36] don't hear anywhere any denominations,
[1:04:38] charismatic churches, any Calvaries, you
[1:04:41] don't hear the verbiage spoke the way
[1:04:42] that this bride speaks.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; But but it's nothing unusual.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Uh because I'd sure like to have taken
[1:04:49] that uh that renegade unbeliever and
[1:04:52] showed him, well, this is why we say
[1:04:54] this. It's in the scripture.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; This is why we talk like this because
[1:04:58] it's Bible. We believe what the word
[1:05:00] says because the word is Christ. But the
[1:05:03] problem is people don't know the word.
[1:05:05] Yes.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; But God's even given us that special
[1:05:07] vernacular even that we use that a lot
[1:05:10] of the world just doesn't use. We're
[1:05:12] gathered together under that one oppos.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; The word. Amen. This message, this
[1:05:17] truth. Amen. That was sent by a prophet
[1:05:20] in this day that we believe. Yes.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And we know that God sent. Amen. People
[1:05:24] can put all kind of false, failures,
[1:05:26] whatever they want to say, but that word
[1:05:27] is perfect. Amen. I've never found me
[1:05:30] myself never found a fault at all. I
[1:05:33] found plenty of faults in my
[1:05:35] interpretations of it. Sometimes I found
[1:05:37] plenty of faults in that. But when it
[1:05:39] comes down to the revelation of God
[1:05:41] showing the word the message, I've never
[1:05:43] found a fault there and it won't be.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. As a perfect dovetail exactly
[1:05:48] because this message came from this word
[1:05:50] and this word is Christ. So God give us
[1:05:53] something that that that we are together
[1:05:56] under. No matter what language you
[1:05:57] speak, no matter what nationality, no
[1:05:59] matter what color, creed, uh uh uh uh uh
[1:06:04] continent, nation,
[1:06:07] all together around the world, the
[1:06:09] bride,
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; that's who she is. All together, come
[1:06:12] together as one. Amen. We come together
[1:06:15] as one.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; So, we're at that time. We're at this
[1:06:22] scriptural time of a dispensation of the
[1:06:25] fullness of times. A dispensation is
[1:06:28] just a time period. Well, a time period
[1:06:31] where you reach a fullness brings an end
[1:06:34] to something. And we're at that end.
[1:06:36] Amen. We're not just at the end of an
[1:06:39] age or end of an era. We are we are at
[1:06:42] the uh or at end of the age to to go
[1:06:46] over into another age. Yes, we're at the
[1:06:49] end of an age, but we're at the end of
[1:06:50] an age of everything.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; We're not at the end of the first age,
[1:06:55] second age, third age. We're at the end
[1:06:57] of the end of it. This is the this is
[1:07:00] the finishing. So, the dispensation of
[1:07:02] the fullness of times of fullness of
[1:07:04] times, fulfillment of that time period,
[1:07:09] that he might gather together in one all
[1:07:12] things in Christ. So all together in
[1:07:15] Christ, both which are in heaven and
[1:07:18] which are on earth, even in Christ, even
[1:07:21] in him.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In him or excuse me, in
[1:07:26] whom also
[1:07:28] we have obained.
[1:07:32] Now the word doesn't say that we are
[1:07:34] going to. It doesn't say uh obtaining.
[1:07:39] Amen. It says obtained,
[1:07:42] which is past tense,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Which it which means that we have
[1:07:47] already received.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; If you have obtained something, it's
[1:07:52] yours. It belongs to you. Amen. You have
[1:07:56] gotten it. You have obtained it. You're
[1:07:59] not obtaining. You're not in a process.
[1:08:02] You're not looking to the future. You
[1:08:05] have obtained it. right now belongs to
[1:08:09] you obtained an inheritance.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't have to worry
[1:08:15] about a will cuz he already wrote me in
[1:08:17] his will.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Obtained. We have obtained in Christ. We
[1:08:26] have obtained an inheritance,
[1:08:30] being predestinated
[1:08:32] according to the purpose of him who
[1:08:35] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:08:37] his own will. Praise the Lord. And I'm
[1:08:40] glad he does. So, we were predestined to
[1:08:43] this. God saw this from before the
[1:08:46] foundation of the world that we were
[1:08:48] predestined to obtain in Christ the
[1:08:52] inheritance. Now we have obtained that
[1:08:55] inheritance
[1:08:56] that 12th verse we should be to the
[1:09:00] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:09:03] Christ in whom ye also trusted we me I
[1:09:10] you also trusted
[1:09:13] that after ye after that ye heard the
[1:09:15] word of truth the gospel of your
[1:09:17] salvation in whom also after that ye
[1:09:21] believed ye were sealed with that holy
[1:09:25] spirit of promise. Now what do we talk
[1:09:27] about the holy spirit we understand is
[1:09:30] it's an earnest amen which you let's
[1:09:33] just finish 14 verse which is the
[1:09:36] earnest it is the earnest or the down
[1:09:39] payment or the beginning of our
[1:09:41] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:09:44] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:09:47] his glory. We've received that earnest
[1:09:49] again. We've received that. We've
[1:09:52] obtained that it belongs to us.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; But we understand now it's just that
[1:09:58] earnest is just a promise that God has
[1:10:00] given us that it belongs to us.
[1:10:03] Understanding and recognizing that there
[1:10:06] is more to come.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what we look
[1:10:09] for. We talk about that going home time
[1:10:12] is that unto is that part that we're
[1:10:15] still looking to be fulfilled. But now,
[1:10:18] now, right now, we have obtained an
[1:10:21] inheritance, the earnest, the Holy
[1:10:24] Spirit in us that brings with it all
[1:10:27] those precious promises of God. Amen.
[1:10:30] Healing, deliverance, salvation, and
[1:10:34] guidance and leadership. Amen. And all
[1:10:36] the blessings,
[1:10:38] everything that God obtains
[1:10:41] is a part of him. We have obtained. It
[1:10:44] belongs to us. It come with the earnest.
[1:10:47] It's like we said last week, when you
[1:10:49] put down earnest money, you buy a house,
[1:10:52] they give you the keys, you can walk
[1:10:54] into that house. The bank cannot tell
[1:10:57] you not to go in that room.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot use the garage. You cannot go
[1:11:03] into the backyard. No, they can't do
[1:11:06] that. When they hand you the keys,
[1:11:08] because of the promise of the
[1:11:10] inheritance of the earnest down payment,
[1:11:12] you own every bit of that whole
[1:11:15] property.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; You can do whatever you want to. It
[1:11:19] belongs to you. Amen. Now, of course, uh
[1:11:23] here in the natural, there's things you
[1:11:25] can't do out because it's outside the
[1:11:27] law. You can't bury a dead body in your
[1:11:30] backyard or something like that. you you
[1:11:33] kind of have to follow along with the
[1:11:35] laws that we have in the land, but the
[1:11:37] property belongs to you.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; You can go in every room. You can occupy
[1:11:42] every part of it. You can change the
[1:11:44] shingles. You can change the cabinets.
[1:11:46] You can completely overhaul the
[1:11:48] bathrooms. You can sew seed in the
[1:11:50] backyard. You can put a pool in the
[1:11:52] backyard. You can put up a big fence
[1:11:54] according to whatever the ordinance of
[1:11:55] that community is. You can you can do
[1:11:57] any because it belongs to you. Now, the
[1:12:00] bank may still hold a note, but that's
[1:12:04] just more of a promise. It says that
[1:12:06] there's more yet still to come.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the good part.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every bit of God's that
[1:12:14] we en every bit of God that we enjoy
[1:12:16] today is still just the earnest.
[1:12:20] What that ought to do to us. Am I
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Just to recognize what God has given us,
[1:12:27] what God's done for us, what belongs to
[1:12:29] us now.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; How what a privilege it is and how how
[1:12:35] overwhelmingly spiritually it is to know
[1:12:38] that you belong to be a part of that
[1:12:40] body. If that's what we feel here, what
[1:12:42] is it going to be on the other side?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Eyes. No wonder Paul said eyes
[1:12:48] not hear, ears not eyes not seen, ears
[1:12:51] not hear. Neither even ever even
[1:12:52] consider in the heart of man what what
[1:12:54] God's got in store for us.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's way beyond anything
[1:12:58] that we would just I was listening to a
[1:13:00] message when I was uh working Thursday
[1:13:03] uh just putting up a ladder rack
[1:13:05] listening to brother Brandham and he was
[1:13:07] talking about uh the the uh song uh the
[1:13:11] love of God and how the second verse of
[1:13:14] that song was written on the wall of an
[1:13:16] insane asylum drive a man crazy just to
[1:13:19] try to contemplate it just to try to
[1:13:21] think of what we've got in store for us
[1:13:23] friend I can just tell you it's going to
[1:13:25] be far beyond anything we can imagine.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Far beyond anything we can
[1:13:30] imagine. You look and say, "Why? Why
[1:13:33] would anyone want to turn that down? Why
[1:13:36] would anyone want to pass that up?" I I
[1:13:39] I read I I read a little snippet thing
[1:13:43] where where this rock and roll guy um
[1:13:47] uh one of his band members have had had
[1:13:50] died and and and he had a dream about
[1:13:53] him. came to him in his dream and he
[1:13:56] talked about how wonderful hell was in
[1:13:58] his dream. And he told him, he said,
[1:13:59] "Well, make sure and save me a seat."
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Boy, you have no clue what
[1:14:05] you're talking about."
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Reminds you It reminds you of the the uh
[1:14:09] the rich young ruler.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Reminds you of the rich young
[1:14:13] ruler had everything. Turned down God
[1:14:15] and got even more. But when he died, he
[1:14:18] turned up lifted up his eyes in hell.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he had four brothers that were
[1:14:24] still left. You imagine what that rich
[1:14:27] young ruler if he could have just come
[1:14:29] back for five minutes and told them what
[1:14:32] he would have told them.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; But there was four more that were headed
[1:14:37] in the same direction.
[1:14:40] What was going to happen to them? They
[1:14:43] were going the same way
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; down that same hole to that same hell.
[1:14:48] And I thought to say, save me a seat in
[1:14:52] hell. Oh,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; a person just knows what I'm talking
[1:14:56] about. Just blind.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're just blind.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; If the gospel is hid and is hid those
[1:15:01] that are lost. It's like brother Dennis
[1:15:03] said in his prayer, they're just blind.
[1:15:05] They cannot see it. Amen. When you're
[1:15:08] blind to something and and sometimes so
[1:15:10] many times we probably uh uh blame
[1:15:13] somebody for something and say, "How can
[1:15:15] you blame someone for not seeing? How
[1:15:18] can you blame uh uh how can you blame a
[1:15:21] blind man for walking into the wall?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; He can't see it. He's blind.
[1:15:28] And I thank God have mercy.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz without the mercy of God, that seat
[1:15:33] will be filled. And it won't be a seed
[1:15:35] either. It'll be pure torment for etern
[1:15:38] for not eternity but forever.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Pure torment.
[1:15:43] It's a horrible thing to think, saints.
[1:15:46] But the bride has received this inher
[1:15:48] this inheritance. We've received the
[1:15:51] earnest of our inheritance now that
[1:15:53] God's given us to be able to live the
[1:15:55] life that we live. Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Be able to enjoy the benefits that we
[1:15:58] enjoy. To be able to have the blessings
[1:16:00] that we have.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not have to depending on on
[1:16:04] medicine or or replacements that God
[1:16:07] heals. Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; God is a healer. You believe that?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; God heals us.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; God delivers us. God strengthens us.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; So many times, friend, we have to draw
[1:16:19] on that strength because, you know,
[1:16:21] every single second of every single day,
[1:16:24] the devil's going to be after you.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; To try to rip you apart and tear you
[1:16:28] apart and get your eye going the wrong
[1:16:30] way, get your attention on the wrong
[1:16:32] thing, to get your focus on something
[1:16:35] else other than him, the devil's going
[1:16:36] to be there to draw you away from him.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; But you got to stay focused. You got to
[1:16:41] keep on that word. You got to stay in
[1:16:43] that spirit. You got to let God continue
[1:16:46] to let let that uh spirit saturate you
[1:16:49] with that anointing so you can overcome
[1:16:52] these things of the world.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Get past the things of the devil to
[1:16:56] overcome. Praise the Lord. Now, let's
[1:16:58] continue reading this.
[1:17:01] Amen. Uh 15th, we're in the 15th chapter
[1:17:04] uh verse now
[1:17:07] of Ephesians 1. Still, still Ephesians 1
[1:17:10] 15. Wherefore, now listen to this and
[1:17:12] think about this. U let me just go back
[1:17:16] and read. You don't have to turn with
[1:17:17] me, but I'm just going to read this
[1:17:18] again and listen to this as I read this
[1:17:21] with what we're about to read. For as
[1:17:23] many as are led by the spirit of God,
[1:17:25] they are the sons of God. For ye have
[1:17:27] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:17:29] to fear, but you have received the
[1:17:31] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry
[1:17:33] above. What have you not received,
[1:17:37] saints? What have you not received?
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; A bondage of fear.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's what you have not received. There
[1:17:46] should be no fear in a Christian.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; None. God's protecting you. God's taking
[1:17:52] care of you. The angels got encamped
[1:17:54] around about those that fear him.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we have not received a bondage
[1:18:00] of fear. Praise God. But you have
[1:18:03] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:18:05] we cry father. The spirit itself bears
[1:18:09] witness with our spirit that we are we
[1:18:11] are the children of God. And if children
[1:18:13] then hes of God and joint hes with
[1:18:16] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:18:18] that we may be also glorified together.
[1:18:20] Now back to Ephesians 1:15.
[1:18:23] Wherefore I also, after I heard of your
[1:18:25] faith in uh in the Lord Jesus, and love
[1:18:29] unto all saints, cease not to give
[1:18:31] thanks for you, making mention of you in
[1:18:33] my prayers, that the God of the Lord of
[1:18:36] our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
[1:18:38] glory, may give unto you the spirit of
[1:18:41] wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[1:18:43] of him, not bondage, not fear, amen, but
[1:18:48] of liberty, of wisdom,
[1:18:51] revelation.
[1:18:53] Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; The eyes of your understanding being
[1:18:58] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:19:01] the hope of his calling. Of his calling,
[1:19:05] not your calling.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's not up to us. It's up to him. We
[1:19:09] belong to him. We give our lives to him.
[1:19:11] It's his calling to you, not mine. Amen.
[1:19:16] Not my call. It's his call. Praise the
[1:19:18] Lord. I just want to obey it.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Live in it. Let the Lord show me in that
[1:19:23] call daily what the Lord wants from me.
[1:19:27] What he wants me to do that call. It's
[1:19:30] the hope of that calling. And what the
[1:19:32] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:19:36] in the saints.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And what is the
[1:19:41] exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:19:44] usward who believe according to the
[1:19:47] working of his mighty power which he
[1:19:49] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:19:51] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:19:53] right hand in heavenly places.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Where are we sitting?
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Heavenly places. Praise. Did we just
[1:20:01] read that over here? Heavenly places.
[1:20:04] Amen. That's your position in Christ.
[1:20:06] Remember we talked about brother Ram
[1:20:07] said that's your position in Christ.
[1:20:11] That heavenly place is your position in
[1:20:13] Christ. When Christ took his position
[1:20:16] where was he and the in in the power and
[1:20:19] authority
[1:20:21] position of God. The power and authority
[1:20:24] or they the scripture says at his right
[1:20:27] hand or Bible says at on his right hand.
[1:20:30] That right hand position of power. What
[1:20:33] does he do? Just taking that right hand
[1:20:36] of power in heavenly places. Just taking
[1:20:40] his place. That's his placement. Praise
[1:20:43] the Lord.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; You think, well, he just got adopted
[1:20:47] there on Mount Transfiguration. Yeah.
[1:20:49] But again, as we're adopted into the
[1:20:52] body, that's just the beginning of our
[1:20:54] adoption. Then there's work to do.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; There's a life to live.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; There's things to accomplish. There's a
[1:21:00] spirit to be led by.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, he did. He was led by the
[1:21:04] spirit. Again, we talked the story about
[1:21:06] Mary going and trying to find him. They
[1:21:09] gone a few days and looked around and he
[1:21:11] was gone.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And they went and looked for him, looked
[1:21:13] for him, looked for him, and they
[1:21:15] finally found him. He says,"Woman, don't
[1:21:17] you know that I must be about my
[1:21:18] father's business?"
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That wasn't building cabinets and
[1:21:22] chairs and c uh uh woodworking. It was
[1:21:26] God Almighty.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Debating the scholars in the temple.
[1:21:32] I must be about my father's business.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And he called her woman. Notice the
[1:21:38] scripture says, "Woman, don't you know?"
[1:21:40] He didn't say, "Oh, hey, mommy." No.
[1:21:43] Woman, you must
[1:21:45] you must know that I have to be about my
[1:21:47] father's business.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We all have to.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; I've had I' I've had to do things in my
[1:21:54] life I believe and feel by the leading
[1:21:56] of the Lord that other people didn't
[1:21:57] understand,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; that didn't make any sense. And if I
[1:22:01] were to be honest to you and look in the
[1:22:02] mirror of my life, I didn't understand
[1:22:04] it.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; But I knew it was God.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; When you know it's God, it doesn't have
[1:22:10] to make sense.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It just has to be according to his
[1:22:15] word, according to his uh spirit. Amen.
[1:22:18] To be led of God. See, Christ was just
[1:22:21] taking that place. A he was just taking
[1:22:24] his placement, his placement there at
[1:22:26] the right hand. All power. That's why
[1:22:28] God said, "This is my beloved son. Hear
[1:22:31] him."
[1:22:32] All power, all authority given into his
[1:22:35] hands. Now, he's just in that position
[1:22:37] sitting in heavenly places. That's our
[1:22:39] placement in heavenly places. Far above
[1:22:42] all principality and power and might and
[1:22:45] dominion and every name that is named,
[1:22:47] not only in this world, but also in that
[1:22:49] world which is to come. Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; And hath put all things under his feet.
[1:22:57] Well, if we're joint hes with Christ,
[1:22:59] let's look at this for a sec.
[1:23:01] If we're joints with Christ
[1:23:04] and everything that we he is an heir of,
[1:23:08] we're hes of with him
[1:23:11] and everything,
[1:23:13] look at this word says, everything was
[1:23:16] put under his feet. Where are they to
[1:23:19] you?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; They're under your feet, too.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:26] Well, let's act like it. Help me, Lord,
[1:23:29] to live like it.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; If it's under his feet, it's under your
[1:23:34] feet.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're a joint air with him. That's
[1:23:36] your inheritance.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer, saints.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; We are not to be defeated.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; We cannot be defeated.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; We are the bride.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Over his all things under his feet. and
[1:23:55] gave him to be the head over all things
[1:23:58] to the church, which is his body, the
[1:24:01] fullness of him that fillth all in all.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me read you this
[1:24:06] quote.
[1:24:08] Reach message read from the other day.
[1:24:15] Breach
[1:24:18] means church ages. Now when Adam sinned
[1:24:23] by eating heeding his wife's reasoning
[1:24:25] instead of holding to God's word, that's
[1:24:28] what made Adam sin. Now think think of
[1:24:30] Adam's position for a moment. He was the
[1:24:33] spoken word son of God. He was put in a
[1:24:36] place with no sin. Uh
[1:24:40] uh everything perfect uh everything
[1:24:42] righteous, no sickness, uh no death. Uh
[1:24:47] he was in a perfect place. He was given
[1:24:50] the inheritance of the world. God gave
[1:24:52] him all this the world. He had in his
[1:24:55] his possession the book of life.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had in his possession the was
[1:25:02] the spoken word son. I if Adam if it had
[1:25:06] never happened the way it did and thank
[1:25:09] God it did. But if it had not happened,
[1:25:12] look what look what would have brought
[1:25:15] to pass. If if this if the fall had not
[1:25:18] taken place, there would have been no
[1:25:20] purpose for Jesus Christ.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; There would have been no reason for him
[1:25:26] to come and shed his blood and die. And
[1:25:29] there would have been no reason for all
[1:25:31] those things to happen if if Adam hadn't
[1:25:33] fallen. of his humanity had come through
[1:25:36] from the spoken word and brought onto
[1:25:39] this earth in in in uh according to
[1:25:42] God's spoken word and brought to life
[1:25:45] and occupied this planet that be I don't
[1:25:49] know a few million people or something
[1:25:50] maybe I I I would begin to guess how
[1:25:53] many I don't know uh I would imagine it
[1:25:56] probably be far less than the seven
[1:25:57] billion that there are here today or
[1:25:59] eight whatever it is now but uh they
[1:26:02] would have all come into fruition. Each
[1:26:04] one would have come forth in his decreed
[1:26:07] time and we would have come forth with
[1:26:09] per perfection and life and amen. But
[1:26:13] because of the fall because of this
[1:26:15] inheritance all this that because Adam
[1:26:18] had control over that he had this
[1:26:20] inheritance his inheritance he had
[1:26:23] control over.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He would say, "Why why would
[1:26:26] brother Brandham say that that Adam
[1:26:28] could speak and name and say?" And I I'm
[1:26:31] probably getting ahead of myself in the
[1:26:33] quote here, but uh why why would all
[1:26:35] this h because it was in it was his
[1:26:37] inheritance.
[1:26:39] This all this was his inheritance. This
[1:26:41] world was his inheritance.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; He had the book of life. It was his.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; He was to be the quote unquote father of
[1:26:48] each one that came forth as it was to be
[1:26:50] spoken into existence.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:26:53] That was his inheritance.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; of course he could speak names say. No
[1:26:58] wonder he could name the animals. No
[1:27:00] wonder he could move mountains. No
[1:27:01] wonder he could move a shade tree over.
[1:27:04] Do what he wanted to do. It was his
[1:27:06] inheritance.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:27:11] Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; That's why I know your children are
[1:27:15] fine. Saints,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; your grandchildren are fine.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz they're your
[1:27:20] inheritance.
[1:27:22] They belong to you.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; They don't belong to the devil.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; They don't belong to the world. I don't
[1:27:27] care where they are. Care what they look
[1:27:28] like, sound like, talk like, act like. I
[1:27:30] don't care. They belong to you. They're
[1:27:32] yours.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam could do whatever he wanted
[1:27:35] to because they belong to him.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name and say
[1:27:38] it. That's it. Is period. Doesn't
[1:27:41] matter. I don't care what else hell
[1:27:43] says. I don't care what the devil says.
[1:27:45] Has nothing to do with me. What the
[1:27:47] devil says does. Has nothing to do with
[1:27:49] me.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:51] Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; That doesn't change my promise one bit.
[1:27:54] That doesn't change my inheritance one
[1:27:56] bit.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; it still belongs to me. It's still mine.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was listening to this song. I I
[1:28:06] have earbuds and I work to songs and
[1:28:08] music and uh uh sometimes message and uh
[1:28:13] I was listening to this song that uh
[1:28:15] Micah had done had put out. I I took his
[1:28:18] playlist. So I play it. I listen and
[1:28:22] this song I believe was in Jimmy
[1:28:23] Swagger's church if I remember right.
[1:28:26] Brother's gone on now. But uh I remember
[1:28:28] them singing it says I'm going to take
[1:28:30] back from the devil what belongs to me.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a little repetitive and it's
[1:28:35] a little worldly like you know with the
[1:28:38] I'm not necessarily an enjoyer of that
[1:28:41] but it just it some reason this week it
[1:28:43] just struck me so strong and say I'm
[1:28:45] taking back what the devil has stole
[1:28:48] from me. You know, the devil is only
[1:28:50] here to kill, to uh to kill and destroy.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to help put him on notice.
[1:28:58] I'm taking back what's mine.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It's my inheritance.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Not his.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That God didn't give me my children for
[1:29:07] the devil to take them away from me.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't give me my grandchildren for
[1:29:11] the devil to take them away from me.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; They belong to me.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:16] They're my inheritance.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever think anything different,
[1:29:22] saints?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Because they're ours.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name. He could
[1:29:28] say because it was his. You can go and
[1:29:31] fry an egg in your kitchen because it
[1:29:33] belongs to you.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let me finish this quote.
[1:29:40] His wife reasoned with Satan and then
[1:29:42] produced the product to Adam. And Adam
[1:29:44] turned loose to the word and sold out.
[1:29:46] That's the only way you can is turn
[1:29:48] loose to the word. You have to turn
[1:29:50] loose to the word. You have to turn your
[1:29:52] back on the word before you can go
[1:29:53] forward in sin.
[1:29:56] Turn loose to the word and sold out. He
[1:29:59] lost also what? His inheritance.
[1:30:03] Oh my. Praise the Lord. Now maybe not
[1:30:07] his internal his eternal inheritance
[1:30:09] that he lost his inheritance that God
[1:30:11] gave him here. He lost his inheritance
[1:30:14] to the world and the book of life. He
[1:30:16] lost his inheritance there because he
[1:30:19] turned loose of the word. Sold out to
[1:30:22] Satan. Lost his inheritance when he lost
[1:30:25] his fellowship and right to life.
[1:30:27] Remember God said the day you eat
[1:30:31] thereof, that day you die.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; My it's the truth.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't die physically. He didn't just
[1:30:40] drop dead with his heart stop beating.
[1:30:42] No, he lost that inheritance. He lost
[1:30:45] that fellowship. He lost that
[1:30:47] connection. He lost that live to ear
[1:30:51] when God would come down in the cool of
[1:30:53] the day and fellowship with him. Live to
[1:30:55] ear. He lost that. He lost his book of
[1:30:58] life. He had lost the inheritance in the
[1:31:00] earth. He lost it to the one he lost it
[1:31:02] to, Satan. Amen. But he lost these
[1:31:05] things
[1:31:07] because God said, "The day you eat
[1:31:10] thereof, that day you will die."
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; And when he lost his life, he also lost
[1:31:16] his inheritance in life because he had
[1:31:21] completely supreme control of the earth.
[1:31:24] But he lost control of it.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; He lost his inheritance in it. That's
[1:31:29] why after that time
[1:31:33] our bodies started decaying and going
[1:31:36] back to the dust because of sin.
[1:31:41] It never was that way to to begin with.
[1:31:43] Won't be that way on the other side.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; But when sin entered in and he lost that
[1:31:49] inheritance, the body started decaying
[1:31:52] and going back to the dust.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; So thanks Adam. uh appreciate the hip
[1:31:57] surgery and the knee surgery and the eye
[1:31:59] surgery and uh the all these things. Uh
[1:32:05] not a very good steward there if I must
[1:32:07] say Adam. But that's when everything
[1:32:11] started going back to the earth.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because in the
[1:32:17] because in the earth was was God's
[1:32:19] create the earth was God's creation, not
[1:32:21] Satan. Satan can't create. It didn't
[1:32:24] belong to Satan. belonged to God. David,
[1:32:26] God gave it in the hands of Adam. Adam
[1:32:29] lost it to the one he lost it to, Satan.
[1:32:32] But Satan did not realize that Jesus
[1:32:34] Christ was going to come one day and
[1:32:36] shed his blood on this earth. The
[1:32:39] chemistry of the blood on this earth and
[1:32:42] buy this earth back.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just like he bought us
[1:32:47] back.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Just like he bought those that have gone
[1:32:50] on and in the grave. Just like those
[1:32:52] have gone on before, they've been
[1:32:53] purchased. They've been purchased with
[1:32:56] his blood. Now, the the the life of the
[1:32:58] blood come back into the believer.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the Holy Ghost. The
[1:33:03] chemistry of the blood went into the
[1:33:05] earth and redeemed this earth back. So,
[1:33:08] everyone that had ever fallen and gone
[1:33:10] gone back into that dust, God will bring
[1:33:13] back again.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Those that belong to him.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There would never have
[1:33:19] been anybody that didn't belong to him
[1:33:21] until the fall.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And when lust came in and sin came in
[1:33:26] and men and women could just procreate
[1:33:28] and start making kids all over the
[1:33:30] place, that's when all these people
[1:33:32] started showing up.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because men and women could just
[1:33:35] procreate, bring another kid into the
[1:33:37] world. And anymore it seems like they
[1:33:40] just bring them into the world and just
[1:33:41] cut them loose. Don't care.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; They don't care what they do. They don't
[1:33:45] want to raise them. They don't want the
[1:33:46] responsibility. They don't want the
[1:33:47] burden of having to raise that child.
[1:33:49] Some some parents are so crazy in their
[1:33:52] thinking that they don't think they
[1:33:54] should even teach that child. Oh, the
[1:33:56] child will learn. Whichever way it wants
[1:33:58] to go. If it wants to be a boy or a
[1:34:00] girl, it can be whatever it wants. Just
[1:34:02] let him decide that. Excuse me. I
[1:34:04] believe God decided that when he gave
[1:34:06] when he brought that baby forth into
[1:34:08] this world.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; You're a boy. You're a girl.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Not an in between.
[1:34:16] You're a boy, you're a girl. But see, he
[1:34:18] lost his inheritance. When he lost that
[1:34:20] inheritance, he lost supreme supreme
[1:34:23] complete supreme control over this
[1:34:25] earth. But remember, as we've preached
[1:34:28] before, God has restored all that back
[1:34:31] to the inheritance that we now possess.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That now belongs to us.
[1:34:37] That's when after right immediately
[1:34:41] after Christ's adoption on Mount
[1:34:43] Transfiguration,
[1:34:45] right after that when God said, "Hear ye
[1:34:49] him."
[1:34:51] Jesus come forth a few verses later and
[1:34:53] said, "Now you speak."
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Whatever you say to this
[1:35:00] mountain be removed to yonder place." It
[1:35:03] has to do it. Why now? help us. That
[1:35:04] inheritance has been brought back. That
[1:35:07] inheritance, the earnest of that
[1:35:09] inheritance has been fully restored back
[1:35:12] to us today.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Now, it's you that has that inheritance.
[1:35:17] It's you that has that authority. You
[1:35:19] speak, you name, you say.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; All of heaven backs you up.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Remember though,
[1:35:30] power without character is satanic.
[1:35:33] Great name.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; You can't just say a Rolls-Royce is
[1:35:37] going to be sitting in the parking lot
[1:35:39] for me when we get done with church.
[1:35:42] I'm going to drive that Rolls-Royce to a
[1:35:44] $20 million mansion up in the foothills
[1:35:46] after after we get done eating.
[1:35:50] Now, see, is that character?
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; No. God's not God's not going to
[1:35:55] acknowledge that,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; That's just selfish. That's just Amen.
[1:36:01] That's just greedy. That's not the plan
[1:36:03] of God.
[1:36:05] It's like Moses. Moses could have stayed
[1:36:07] in the hallowed halls of Egypt, but what
[1:36:09] he did, right?
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He fell to the lowest place and became a
[1:36:12] a mudber in the mud with them and
[1:36:16] stomping around in the mud with his with
[1:36:18] his own people
[1:36:20] with the inheritance that God had given
[1:36:22] them. Amen.
[1:36:25] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; That inheritance belongs to us, saints.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] sup complete supreme control of the
[1:36:32] earth. Let me finish this quote. He was
[1:36:35] a god of the earth. God is the god of
[1:36:38] the universe everywhere. But his son had
[1:36:41] this earth under his own control. He
[1:36:43] could speak. He could name. He could
[1:36:45] say, he could stop nature. He could do
[1:36:47] anything he wanted to. See, but when he
[1:36:50] did that, he lost his inheritance. Now
[1:36:53] Adam could say, "Let this mountain here
[1:36:55] be moved over there." And it would do
[1:36:57] it. Adam could say, "Let this tree here
[1:36:59] be plucked up and planted over here,"
[1:37:01] and it would do it.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; For he had complete supreme control as a
[1:37:07] minor God under God our father because
[1:37:11] he was a son of God. Because he was a
[1:37:16] son of God.
[1:37:19] Amen.
[1:37:21] Uh what are we?
[1:37:25] I consider myself a son of God.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; You consider yourself a son or a
[1:37:31] daughter of God,
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; a child of God.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Well, if that's been fully restored or
[1:37:38] at least the earnest, then where where
[1:37:41] does that place us,
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; saints? I'm just afraid that this bride
[1:37:45] lives so far below her privileges today.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I I'm afraid that we live so far below
[1:37:51] our privileges today.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. of what belongs to us, what
[1:37:55] authority we have, the inheritances God
[1:37:57] has given us.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; we're looking forward and we talk all
[1:38:00] the time and I do and I will keep doing
[1:38:02] it. Looking forward to what God's got in
[1:38:05] store for us, friend. But let's not
[1:38:07] forget what God's got for us here. what
[1:38:11] God's doing for us. Now,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; this part of that inheritance that God's
[1:38:17] given us, that we have control over,
[1:38:20] that God's given us authority over, it's
[1:38:23] a part of our inheritance.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Belongs to us. Glory to God.
[1:38:31] He had complete supreme control as a
[1:38:34] minor God under God our father because
[1:38:36] he was a son of God. Now, Brother Brown
[1:38:38] says, "Now," this is what he said. I'm
[1:38:40] reading the quote. "Now, couldn't we
[1:38:43] stop here just a minute and get our real
[1:38:47] sermon?"
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; What do you think he's thinking? He's
[1:38:51] thinking the same thing I just said.
[1:38:54] You're a son or daughter of God now.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; You belong to God now.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; This inheritance has been fully restored
[1:39:01] to the bride for this day that brought
[1:39:03] forth this word and the truth and the
[1:39:05] power of it. We're at the end of this.
[1:39:07] It belongs to us right now.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; It's mine. It's yours.
[1:39:16] Now, couldn't we stop here a minute and
[1:39:18] just get our real sermon? See? Oh, then
[1:39:20] if the blood has cleansed it back, what
[1:39:23] about now?
[1:39:25] See, look what the son of God, the
[1:39:28] second Adam did, and said, "The works
[1:39:31] that I do shall you do also."
[1:39:33] See, Adam lost his inheritance, the
[1:39:36] earth. Now, it passed from the hands of
[1:39:37] the one he sold it out to, Satan. He
[1:39:39] sold his faith to God to Satan's uh
[1:39:41] faith in God to Satan's reasoning.
[1:39:44] Therefore, his eternal life, his right
[1:39:46] to life, the right to the tree of life,
[1:39:48] earth, earth, he forfeited every bit to
[1:39:51] the hands of Satan, passed it from the
[1:39:54] hand of Satan. But now now now
[1:39:59] it has been returned
[1:40:02] and has been uh to us his bride.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; The inheritance the seed of Abraham.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Seed of Adam's great it says amen. That
[1:40:13] that was destroyed brought back belongs
[1:40:16] to the bride now belongs to us.
[1:40:20] That no wonder brother Ram said what you
[1:40:21] saw temporarily in my ministry
[1:40:25] temporarily in his ministry will be done
[1:40:29] in the fullness through the bride in
[1:40:31] this last day.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; God help us. It won't be no great big
[1:40:35] show. It won't be no great big display
[1:40:38] or anything like that, but it just be a
[1:40:41] little little something here, little
[1:40:44] something there or whatever as God does
[1:40:47] it and you speak it and it comes to
[1:40:50] pass. You just claim that that belongs
[1:40:53] to you saints belongs to us. Doesn't
[1:40:55] belong to the devil. We belong to him.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our inheritance belongs to us
[1:41:00] through Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:41:04] that great inheritance Adam lost. Let's
[1:41:07] go um to Hebrews.
[1:41:12] I'm going to read a couple more
[1:41:13] scriptures and I'll close here in just a
[1:41:15] minute. Hebrews 9.
[1:41:19] Hebrews 9 11
[1:41:26] Hebrews 9:11.
[1:41:30] But Christ being come uh being come a
[1:41:32] high priest of good things to come by a
[1:41:35] greater and more perfect tabernacle not
[1:41:37] made with hands that is to say not of
[1:41:40] this building. Neither by the blood of
[1:41:42] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[1:41:47] entered in once into the holy place
[1:41:50] having obtained eternal redemption for
[1:41:54] us. Eternal redemption.
[1:41:58] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; An eternal redemption means it is
[1:42:03] finished. It's unto it's done.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Uh eternal means it well eternal means
[1:42:09] it didn't begin and it won't end.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we were as we just read in
[1:42:15] Ephesians predestined to this
[1:42:20] eternal predestined. He obtained eternal
[1:42:24] redemption for us. For if the blood of
[1:42:27] bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
[1:42:30] hepher, sprinkling the unclean,
[1:42:32] sanctified to the purifying of the
[1:42:34] flesh,
[1:42:36] how much more shall the blood of Christ,
[1:42:38] who through the eternal spirit, altered
[1:42:41] himself without spot to God, purge your
[1:42:45] conscience from dead works to serve the
[1:42:48] living God.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. purged our conscience
[1:42:53] from dead works to serve a living God.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Not a dead God. A living God.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; A living God who proves and works and
[1:43:02] manifests in our own lives today. Not a
[1:43:06] history God. Not a God just of the
[1:43:09] Bible, but a God in your life. A God
[1:43:12] that lives through you. A God that
[1:43:14] speaks and acts and works through you.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; A living God.
[1:43:20] for this cause. He is the mediator of
[1:43:23] the New Testament. Praise the Lord. Know
[1:43:26] what a mediator is? It's a liaison.
[1:43:30] Person that works in between.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; An an intervention between two parties.
[1:43:37] Amen. To try to bring back or restore
[1:43:40] peace or fellowship or communion.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Right. uh to bring some kind of formal
[1:43:45] uh pact, amen, between uh uh two groups.
[1:43:50] And as we especially Gentiles were lost
[1:43:54] and had no hope and were headed to hell
[1:43:56] as fast as we could, had no relation
[1:43:59] with God, humanity and God had come
[1:44:01] completely apart.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus came that mediator
[1:44:07] and as brother Bradom said, heaven and
[1:44:09] earth embraced one another. Heaven and
[1:44:12] earth, human humanity and God. Communion
[1:44:16] again, fellowship again.
[1:44:19] Union again, together again, one again.
[1:44:25] Praise the Lord. That mediator brought
[1:44:27] that pack together. Amen. To arbitrate
[1:44:30] between the two of us.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brought grace.
[1:44:35] The grace of God.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] The grace of God
[1:44:40] been said, it's been spoke. What it
[1:44:43] means to us saints, the mediator.
[1:44:46] He is the mediator of the New Testament.
[1:44:50] That by means of death for the
[1:44:52] redemption of the transgressions that
[1:44:54] were under the first testament that they
[1:44:57] which are called might receive those
[1:44:59] that were are called. There we are with
[1:45:01] that calling again. Amen. I wonder we
[1:45:04] started I think the first week calling.
[1:45:06] Make your calling and election sure.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For that called which
[1:45:12] are called
[1:45:14] might receive the promise of eternal
[1:45:18] inheritance.
[1:45:20] An eternal inheritance.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God for what we're looking to,
[1:45:24] what we're going to. But what do we have
[1:45:26] now? What has God given to us now? What
[1:45:30] are we looking for? What do we have?
[1:45:31] What belongs to us right now? the
[1:45:34] promises that God has shown us. The
[1:45:36] Easter Seal,
[1:45:38] he that understandeth,
[1:45:40] he that knoweth his place in this hour,
[1:45:43] knoweth his place in this hour. He that
[1:45:45] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:45:47] that has sent me, past tense, hath sent
[1:45:50] me, everlasting life, shall not come
[1:45:52] into the judgment, but is already passed
[1:45:54] from death unto life. Then when this new
[1:45:56] eternal life dwells in you, it is the
[1:45:59] potential or the earnestness of you
[1:46:02] being quickened from from mortal to
[1:46:05] immortality.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Holy Spirit earnest the
[1:46:10] promise. Amen. Remember that's our
[1:46:12] promised land. Brother Aaron said just
[1:46:15] like Joshua went and divided out the
[1:46:18] land to them, their promised land. This
[1:46:21] the Holy Spirit is our promised land.
[1:46:23] Amen. that we've received. It's the
[1:46:25] promise of God that he's given us. Amen.
[1:46:28] Then then when this eternal life dwells
[1:46:30] in you is the potential or earnestness
[1:46:33] of you being quickened but from mortal
[1:46:35] to immortality in eternal inheritance.
[1:46:40] Let me say that again. When this spirit
[1:46:41] has formed you, the individual has come
[1:46:44] unto upon you. It is the potential of
[1:46:48] your eternal inheritance that God
[1:46:50] thought of you and made for you before
[1:46:53] the foundation of the world.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we just got to live up
[1:46:58] to who we are.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just got to live up to what God
[1:47:02] has made us.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; We got to live up to Look, if if you
[1:47:06] were if you were I I don't know. I don't
[1:47:09] want to call any names today. Used to be
[1:47:12] all these rich. If if you were the son
[1:47:14] of an Elon Musk or a a Bill Gates or a
[1:47:19] Warren Buffett or one of these 500
[1:47:22] billion dollars they got if you were the
[1:47:24] son of of someone like that would you
[1:47:28] legitimately now I may somebody mentally
[1:47:31] exhausted but and anyway I almost said a
[1:47:36] word you're probably not politically
[1:47:37] correct supposed to say today but you're
[1:47:39] not mentally right. You would go up and

[1:49:34] Because that man is not the richest man
[1:49:36] in the world.

[1:50:05] inheritance

[1:50:11] asked me for an oak tree and I gave you
[1:50:13] an acorn, now the life in the oak tree
[1:50:14] is in the acorn now, but you have to
[1:50:17] wait till it grows up. So we did. So uh
[1:50:19] so do we. When we when you receive the

[1:51:31] of God through faith unto salvation,
[1:51:34] ready to be revealed in the last time.

[1:51:56] right as a son.
[1:52:02] But if but if he was the right son the
[1:52:05] son that would obey his father then that
[1:52:08] son was adopted or placed positionally.
[1:52:11] He became heir. Heir to whatever the
[1:52:15] father had.

[1:52:37] inheritance. It is our inheritance
[1:52:40] incorruptible
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; with the nature with the character of

[1:53:33] dollars or billions of dollars, whatever
[1:53:35] it is, clamoring for that. They got two

[1:54:06] until the testator dies.
[1:54:10] Amen. But the mediator of the New
[1:54:12] Testament testament Jesus Christ has
[1:54:16] already died. But not only did he die to

[1:54:22] one that enforces it.
[1:54:26] He's the one that come back to bring
[1:54:28] that enforcement to light for us. And

[1:54:35] and so that every one of us could have a
[1:54:37] portion.
[1:54:39] Every one of us could be a part of that
[1:54:41] body. Amen. Every one of us could have a

[1:59:08] know where we're going. Uh we'll
[1:59:10] probably if the contractors get
[1:59:12] everything up to speed where we were
[1:59:15] last week, we'll probably go back there.

[1:59:31] week because we got a job going on over
[1:59:33] at the outlet mall uh that started this
[1:59:36] past week over at the outlet mall at
[1:59:38] Twin Peaks. Uh so we may go over there
[1:59:43] but nobody's scheduled so I'm just not
[1:59:45] sure but I'll let you know how how that
[1:59:48] comes out or what's going to happen from
[1:59:50] there. Um, also uh we uh we're missing
