work no matter how far you get you know when you're a human being in our flesh bodies we get to a place to where we basically stop growing we actually start declining even but in the spirit world you never stop growing in christ you never stop growing you just continue to grow and grow and grow in him and i guess the pinnacle of that growth is when he takes us home amen the trouble spot we get to sometimes is when we feel like we've gone so far we've grown so big we don't need to grow anymore that's a bad spot we should never get to the place that we feel like that we've can't grow anymore amen brother brandon always said if if if you want more of god that just proves there's more of god for you amen praise the lord i believe that's the same for us today so we're learning continuing to learn to lean on him amen [Music] [Music] finding more power than i ever dreamed i am learning to lean on jesus yes i'm learning to leave [Music] then i ever dreamed [Music] [Music] that is so [Music]

amen praise the lord jesus oh my saints just makes me think of what jesus went through amen how he suffered how he had to battle himself and die to himself before he could die physically at calvary amen you know that's a lesson for all of us we all have to die to ourselves amen praise the lord jesus what a what a song it is amen praise the lord amen we'll go to the lord in prayer now amen i have a couple prayer requests here that i want to mention to you obviously um we see several empty seats here today amen brother dennis and brother danny as we sent out a text to everyone had brother dennis had been battling pneumonia or his doctor said he was in the beginning stages of pneumonia texting this morning he's still feeling the effects of it but he feels he's getting a little better every day so we're thankful for that brother danny said that he has still has a little congestion but he's feeling much better today as well i mean but he was going to stream sister matisse is not with us again she's still a little under the weather she ate some food or something upset her stomach yesterday too so uh please remember her in prayer also brother pat texted me this morning and sister pat had a fever and wasn't feeling well um i'm kind of a little upset but i just this uh medical world has just gotten getting the better of me i guess they covered tester and sent her home they couldn't do anything to her until they tested her and she's been shot up and got the shots and everything and i it just so much for emergency i mean where's the emergency you come into the emergency room because you're sick and they send you home waiting two days for a test result it's just i it's just sad it's so bad i tell you what it does to me saints is telling me that we need to be faithful in christ and the faith of god because there may be a day we won't get treated in hospitals and medicine and doctors we're going to rely on the great physician something came to me yesterday that just kind of you know with pursuing the hospital and brother charlie passing and the sickness and things that's going around this is just is this just sort of what the bride's going to be going through here right before she goes home i don't know is it that is this kind of what they always talk about i've always disagreed with a lot of ministers squeeze perspectives but um is this a part of what that is i don't know all the people going on that could just be a part of it it's getting us in that into that place uh it could very well be but sister pat's at home not feeling well uh i i don't want to jump into the preaching uh you know brother henry green always had a saying blessed is the man who can lead songs without preaching kind of hard to do when you're a preacher so forgive me but uh got a little wild when i found that that wouldn't they didn't even treat sister pat and i know they just tested her and sent her home but she has a fever so brother pat uh is gonna stay home with her today he was running out of propane and different things so just pray for them if you would also sister lydia woke up this morning uh and felt she had a sort of a stomach and flu so please remember her in prayer if you would they're not here with us today the bio steroids was going to be here they just ride text me said they woke up late alarm didn't go off or something so um but we're thankful that god is here as you notice uh i've got two chairs out i wasn't sure if sister teresa was going to be here today but um please pray for sister teresa and the family uh the sotelo family brother charlie went to be with the lord this week i put a chair for brother charlie back where his wheelchair would be and serenity took his place so praise the lord i i got a detached chair here for brother angel jr on the second row right here that's why both of those churches those both of those chairs are detached from the road uh they've gone on to be with the lord this past six months year uh brother charlie this week so brother charlie would be sitting back there were sister's serenity is but he's not in the wheelchair anymore no you can stay you can stay right there brother charlie would be happy that you're in his seat today but brother charlie would be set back there if he was in his wheelchair but thank god he doesn't need a wheelchair anymore praise the lord so brother charlie take any seat you want brother angel any seat you want those are just symbolic there amen for brother angel and brother charlie we're going to be with the lord here but that precipitates again my prayer requests that we remember the satello family and sister teresa in prayer if we could uh with brother charlie going home to be with the lord micah gave me and this is not an excuse of any kind and i don't make any excuses i can only tell you what i felt in my heart i told you for a couple of weeks what i felt on my heart about persist for sister priscilla and for charlie micah's like well maybe you know the spirit that's filling my heart is the rapture so close we're just looking into that other dimension brother charlie here with us and we don't know but i believe it's that close i believe it's that close so maybe we're just getting a little glimpse of the heavenly vision i mean that grand reunion where we're all going to be together again i can't help but feel a little discouraged though i i was genuinely very happy and thrilled and looking forward to having brother charlie in service with us more often uh so uh i'm gonna miss him greatly for the charlie was a sweet spirit um that'll be missed very dearly a very rare sweet spirit i should say amen so uh please remember them in prayer if you would amends any anyone now have an unspoken request that's all the things that's of course again priscilla is still in the hospital i'll have brother angel give an update on sister priscilla in a few minutes i take go ahead and do it before we go to go to the lord in prayer there was a couple things he had in the air yesterday when i talked to you last and maybe there's update if you if you'd like to maybe give everybody bring everybody up to date about her situation okay um good morning good bless you all um she's doing she's doing well the i guess they rotated the nursing staff and one night or her because she has two drains on her now and um the new one they put on i guess they filled up and they kind of the new nurses forgot about it and it burst so that it was everywhere so they cleaned it up and they believed some of it might have actually got onto her wounds and might have re-injured causing her the pain and i guess the temperatures in the fever she was getting and she's just been really it's amazing she's been close to the lord even though this is going on she's thanking him for this because there's something here for all of us to learn from and see for my children as well and and it's just amazing because she's really recovering fast right now there were some prayers that went out a sister caught us and she didn't know my wife had a hole but the doctor said it's closed and um this is kind of amazing because it closed fast they do close but it takes time for the time she's been in there um it was it's just a miracle that we've i've been seeing her every day if she's actually able to walk she's still on the um diet but they want to move her on to um two then with no pain and nothing they'll send her home to to be with us and then they'll just reschedule if they have to take the dreams out now or later but she's getting straight every day it's amazing um the lord's been working on her so much that um she's been actually a testimony for the last four weeks for the nurses there because she's been playing the bible and sermons and all kinds of things every day every night and they've all been hearing it so it was amazing because they come in and ask what is that what are you listening to and it's just the lord's been doing a lot so i thank him i praise him for it praising that he's healing my wife because we all know the prophet said he'll use anything in so what is her pain level at now she's having better her pay level um should be amazing she's got a five and a four good and she's actually been pushing through it and they're taking off the meds that she's doing good that's a way better testimony than yesterday praise the lord amen so thankful of that amen god bless you sister teresa brother chuck i don't think i've seen you since we climbed down that mountain huh maybe it's been a while you're looking good brother good to see you god bless you amen brother hey i knew you were but i couldn't remember your name billy billy praise the lord welcome good to have you on what's your name teresa teresa thank you glad to see you i got a chair for brother charlie back there sister there's a sister serenity took his place this morning i put a detached chair off that back row where he would be sitting this morning so then sister serena he didn't know but she'd come and set his place i told her i said brother charlie be honored they're sitting in his tear of death this morning so i'm missing very dearly amen praise the lord sister norma had a request here uh before we go to the lord in prayer praise the lord for healthy great grandson this is more of a testimony i guess i should have read this ahead of time testimony praise the lord for healthy uh great grandson and for everything that went well praise the lord and i know sister shelia had a baby born into their family what was that it was her great nephew i mean sister sheely had a great nephew born too healthy and strong amen by the grace of god so thankful the lord continues to the circle of life doesn't he amen bringing life into the world let's stand if we can't and then i'm going to ask brother uh angel if he would take these needs to the lord in prayer heavenly father we come before you praising your holy

song one of them or all of them i'm not sure they're going to have a special to sing micah's got a couple of testimonies as they're getting ready to come that he wants to give i we usually write them down but these are a little leafy he said so he wanted to take a minute if he could give them to you poorly yeah sorry there's just a couple uh this is kind of an eventful um so uh on the way to so i've been working with brother tom this couple weeks for the gym show and on though i had to fill my car up with oil the other day and i didn't realize i accidentally left the cap off of the oil um and i realized it was kind of smoking when i stopped at the light but my gauge wasn't saying i was running hot or anything so just wait until i got to the um to the show and open the hood and realize that the cap has been left off um so oil had kind of spurt a little bit onto the engine it was smoking but the way they made the input there's like a flat metal piece over the hole so not as much oil could come out i guess so i just want to thank the lord that that everything was fine if you use a lot of oil or run dry and ruin the engine or anything i just want to keep them keeping us safe as well we work with hundreds of pounds of rock up to the biggest one he has seven tons so just for keeping it safe and things like that um and the other day i i've been really low on money since uh started and stuff like that um so i really needed something to drink so i went up to the standard like oh we're closed uh like okay uh and it was on walkways she was like wait i made this lemonade that no one came and got you want it so the lord gave me a lemonade the other day and and then the last three days that i've been working with him um i've needed enough to finish my car payment this month and i didn't have enough and so on the way home i was like well lord you know what i need you've always provided and just then brother tom called me like hey i realized that you might need money so stop by the house and i'll pay you for the last three days you've been working so it was definitely enough to finish off my car payment so it's one thing for always providing many different ways amen amen praise the lord god is good amen praise the lord come on whoever's coming they want to say hello to priscilla god bless you amen and others that are streaming that said they're gonna stream but the dentist for the danny uh sister matisse maybe sister sheila the five steroids god bless you amen welcome on the stream today okay come on whoever's coming amen brother angel told um i was just feeling sad because i missed my mom i was just feeling sad because i missed my mom so i just started praying for her and as i was praying i started hearing angels see but they weren't seeing any songs they were just vocalizing and it really touched my heart and it made my phones shake and i felt like like they were like and like letting me know that my health was okay amen praise the lord wonderful are you the one to see yeah come on i can tell you why i'm with her until she's read as a beast nothing to be embarrassed about you with families right um i'm going to be singing a song that my mom really loved [Music] how could i express i can sing this song so [Music] is [Music] [Music] move [Music] praise you again and again amen [Music] oh [Music] cause [Music] don't you get child me [Music] amen [Music] so i'll throw my [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] amen don't you sometimes you don't have to be in church states but you just feel sometimes going down the road or on a job or something and you just feel like throwing your hands up and you're saying god amen oh it happens so often to me i i know that song is so real because that's how i feel so many times i don't always do it but uh i often feel like that amen amen praise the lord there's about a dozen of us went on that trip and only three or four of us really made it down alive and that brother chuck was one of them brother chuck would step step right there me and him together we had good fellowship on that trip brother i don't want to do it again but i love the fellowship but i really did that was wonderful go right here my dad passed a couple days but like that know the lord yes he's in a better place and all of us are witnessing the second sword of his body every animal every dog in the neighborhood curtain of time meet with us again amen i agree with that brother my dad's been gone almost 30 years and i still miss him amen but he said he's with the lord and that's what matters that's what i'm looking forward to amen praise the lord can we stand to our feet now we'll open our bibles to excuse me we'll open our bibles to exodus in exodus chapter 15 we'll read one verse of scripture here exodus chapter 15 as i said um i believe that what the lord gave me yesterday wouldn't be too lengthy today but however he leads good to have each one of you god bless you you've been welcome the house of lords you're streaming god bless you as well amen we have a few out that is not feeling well today but uh god is good every man god say either god's the blesser god is the provider he's with us now amen praise the lord exodus chapter 15 we'll read one verse verse 26 but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious jesus father it's a privileged lord once again to pull back the pages of this sacred writ lord that you've given us god jesus christ in letter form that shows us and reveals to us lord what is in here that you have us to see and know god it's an honor father for you to give us it was a day there was a time where even your children did not have this bible that they could open and read but lord you blessed us today this last day what a privilege it is to live in this last day god knowing that the great things that you do for us in this great and dreadful day lord of the lord that you have for us to be able to open this book and to read these these pages these words lord that you've given to us inspired by the holy ghost lord that it would anchor into our souls and reveal itself to us father that our desire would become to it and to live it to the best of our ability that you give us in our human flesh forgive all of our sins and iniquities lord and lord take complete control over the remaining part of this service lord this important part god of the ministering of your word trusting that you would speak to us once again anoint not just speaker myself here but to hear each one of us here today that lord what you to have to say will not return void but accomplish in each one of us what you sent it forth for lord and we thank you give you the praise and glory for all that is done and uh and thank you lord for for always being with us never leaving or forsaking us and we commit the remaining part of this to you lord that it will be for your glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen exodus 15 26. let's read this one verse of scripture and let you be seated and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and we'll do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee yes amen you can be seated if you'd like i mean how many times each one of us have felt that healing power that god has healed us with and the scripture precedent that god tells us he is our healer he is still the great physician he's still the one that that heals all of our afflictions and diseases but there's the physical healing that we probably major on more than anything um and i've just titled this the lord that healeth thee and we major a lot of times on the physical healing i guess it comes from pentecost and the gifts of the spirit and and all the things that came from that and through all the faith healers and and brother branham and the different ones and it came to a place that so many times the the major uh focus was on physical healing but i really want to talk about it and really the more important part to me is the spiritual aspect of healing because you know there's a spiritual sickness that god can come and bring in and bring that bomb of gilead to bring healing to our spirits and to our souls to our inner being that that that it actually is the the engine room of the of the ship uh the ship that we look at it you can make it pretty and paint it up and make it look great and and it can be a great shape but unless unless what's taking place in the engine room is working the way it's supposed to and and is a viable engine and it has gas and it has oil in it it's running the way it's supposed to i don't care how pretty the outside is i don't care how good and how well healed the outside is if the inside is not uh the way it's supposed to be it's not going anywhere it's not gonna accomplish anything it's not gonna do anything so really what would be the more important healing would it be the physical healing which again we made your own so much for the spiritual healing amen you know a lot of times we've done here at this congregation this church especially for people that we may not know that well or people that have just asked us in passing to pray for them or have our church pray for them and we say more than anything or loved ones that that aren't serving the lord more than anything we ask god heal them spiritually first amen heal their spiritual being before you bring a physical healing because the spiritual healing is more important and if the spiritual healing is taken care of a lot of times the physical healing comes and just falls right in line but it's the spiritual healing that that means the most it's the spiritual healing that cuts us the deepest amen you know priscilla's been through operations my little joel's been through operation here recently and we uh many of us been in hospitals and things and you know we've been sick or we've had to have surgery or we've had to take medicine and those kind of things and and those things bring us up and and are intended to bring us back to the physical condition that we're supposed to be and that's important it's important to be in the in the best physical condition that the lord give us to be able to serve him with you can't serve god in the capacity that he wants us to so many times if your spiritual aspect or if your physical aspect is diminished if god says go do this and you're physically incapable of doing it then yeah it makes a big difference if you're physically well or not but the but it's more important that the spiritual healing takes place because the that uh because it helps bring the physical healing about if the spiritual healing takes place then a person can be able to have the faith to reach out and touch god for that physical healing many times again we find healing through doctors and medicine and different things sometimes god does miraculous things for us we've sat here and had how many times testimonies of miracles that god has done for us outside of medical intervention right that god has done for us and healed us blessed us provided for us and how many times god does that it's been outstanding but one but when god brings that spiritual healing friend then it solves all the problem it it dissolves all the doubt because then you know you're you're in the right place with the lord that's what matters the most the spiritual healing comes first and see god god loves his children beyond what any imagination or thought or understanding could could comprehend god loves us way more than we could ever even begin to explain and or or understand we just in our little finite p brains we'll just never be able to understand it all it just and so many things goes again and his love so many of the things of his love goes against what we have been taught as we grow up right you know the love that we are taught when we grow up is the uh if you're hurt got a booboo and you hold them and you cuddle them and everything you know uh but perfect love is just as corrective as it is as it is uh physical or or uh uh the uh the emotion the the corrective love is just as important and and god uses that love to us just as much as he does anything because that corrective love works more on our spirit than the other does amen it brings us in line with god with his word with the purpose that he has for each one of us in our lives now let's get to a couple of scriptures i want to read first of them that you can probably maybe even imagine is in job job chapter five now what better man probably in the bible that we could talk about that that desired more than anything that healing from god now at the end of all the things that satan had done to him at the end of all that he was attacked with those sore boils from the top of his head to the soles of his feet so certainly he did need physical healing as well but more than that he would have given all of that over if the spiritual healing of all that had taken place prior to that would have all come back he wouldn't give it all amen i believe job would the sore boils wasn't a problem for job that that was just flesh but the spiritual wounds that he had gotten how physical wounds can become deep but physical wounds can be a band-aid or or or uh some kind of uh stitches or or something like that but a spiritual wound you can't see it a spiritual wound you can't put a stitch on it you can't put a band-aid on it you can't well back in my day we put with cure chrome does anybody you know what that is older people probably know what your chrome is my body sometimes when i was a kid was red all over because i get scratches and beats and everything all over me and my mom would stick and she had taken look she slathered that stuff on there too i'd have a little scratch like this whole top my hands red me cure chroma it was all red a little dipstick and she had trouble all over me but you can't do that to a spiritual woman amen there's got to be a different type of healing that comes in a spiritual womb a spiritual wound can only be healed by god god's the only one that can bring spiritual healing you can go to doctors you go to medicine you go to all that and you can go to psychiatrists and things like that and you know i don't have anything against them but the best spiritual healing you can get comes from god he's the one that created to begin with and it's the spiritual atmosphere the spiritual aspect of it that he specializes in not that he's not especially every other part of it because he made all of us amen but the spiritual part again you can't put a band-aid on it man has created a band-aid to put on or or stitches or a doctor or a hospital but but man's treated all those things and that's good thank god for it god give man the intelligence to be able to do that that's good to have an operation to uh to uh like they did priscilla's stick a tube in you and drain something out of you it's not supposed to be in there things like that you know thank god god gives gives them the intelligence to do that but the spiritual healing is a whole different aspect amen how many times you hear on tape and people would come up to brother branham and and he would grab their hands in the early days and there's no vibration and there's nothing happening brother brown's like well there's nothing wrong with you but see there is something wrong with them it's like that girl that came up while she was a young lady at the time she saw brother brown and come up and said there's nothing wrong with you but there was but it wasn't physical it was spiritual so then there had to be a deeper dive into it more than just a a a grabbing of the hand or a vibration in the arm or hand or something there had to be something deeper to go in to find out what exactly was wrong with this person because it wasn't a physical problem but the spiritual problem that she was having was calling causing physical problems her spiritual problem was what was in her spirit was what was causing her the issues that was affecting her physical being and all the physical manifestations she was experiencing was because of what had happened in her spirit when she was a kid then brother then a vision breaks out and brother and god shows this prophet a girl running down in a vision says this little girl being chased by a big angry dog with a ponytail flying behind her on her back and god said and god spoke to brother ram said that's what your problem is from the time that that dog chased her this mean angry dog chased her when she was a little girl that spiritual bruise that spiritual cut that had been in her had stayed there her entire life so when she got older that was never taken care of and so when she got older it began to affect her physical being this woman didn't need a touch physically she needed to touch spiritually she needed a spiritual healing for that wound in her spirit to go away to be healed to be to be made better for the physical part to be made better and of course god did that god spoke to her or god spoke to brother branham and spoke to her now there's probably no greater person in the scripture i mean there's a lot of things that's happened to a lot of people in the scripture a lot of examples we have could bring up but probably the best one you can think of is job now i want you to see something here and i've said this before and i maintain this but job was hedged joe was a child of god you agree joe was a child of god so we've got to establish that first god job was a child of god are you a child of god so you got to establish that that's first thing if you're not a child of god that's it's different amen it pains me because i still in my humanity i still question sometimes i say god why i mean david called to god and said god why did the wicked prosper so right when this is going on and this is going on and and your children are being uh tortured and tormented and all the things that's going on god why does the wicked prosper yeah and sometimes in my spirit i get the same way i think god why why would you take such a precious soul like brother charlie and there's so much evil going on in this world but see charlie belonged to god charlie was in god's hands god's not responsible for all the others amen now if they touch one of his children then that's a different story but god's not responsible for any of the others he's responsible for his children amen god's responsible for his honor sometimes the family comes over tapped in zach come and bring the kids over and joel goes out and plays with the little boys well when they get out of line a little bit tabitha goes up to the door and say joel now this this and this that's her son she doesn't go to the door and say hey you little boy from across the street no that's not her son she's not responsible for him now if he starts beating up on joel or something like that although god helped the little boy if he tried if he tried to do something like that then that's a different story but if it just plain she goes she's responsible for hers god's responsible for his own god's responsible for his children amen and whether we understand it or not it's up to him god is responsible for job and god had job hedged god had jobs so heads that satan couldn't even touch you right you know brother brahm said you could be so lost and god satan can't even find you amen but god satan satan went to god and begged him to be able to take that he said i can't get to him because you've got him his i can't even touch him are you a child of god was he a child of god well why is it any different from us than it was for him right if you're a child of god you're heads too god's got you so hedged that satan can't even find you amen praise the lord now the only problem is that you step out from about outside that hedge now that's different brother man said if you step out from under the blood that's different but if you're in that but doesn't mean you're not a child of god but that just leaves you open to what the devil could do to you amen so there's there's all these things being said and i'm going to make a statement and i know people disagree with me and i hope you don't get mad at me but i have people would say well so-and-so would be here if they got the shot and if you get the coca-cola that's fine i again you do what you feel led to do people say that maybe about brother charlie oh he had been here so and so such that charlie satella was a child of god and i don't i'm not making this service about charlie so forgive me but it's the best example i know at this time right child of god he's in god's hands covet no covet heart attack no heart attack cancer no cancer uh diabetes no diabetes whatever it is he's in god's hands that's all that matters you heard the testimony chuck brother chuck told us god those angels come and pack brother charlie's so home right amen because he is a child of god god's responsible for him he said oh he'd be here saints when your time comes you're going to go that's right it doesn't matter if it's x y z it doesn't matter which vehicle god chooses to take you any one of us i could drop right here now for no good reason at all going to be with the lord i could any one of us could for no reason at all because it's god's calling us home and that's what and that's what matters so i'm sorry if you're a child of god people make it like that satan circumvents the will of god and takes you by so-and-so action oh he had a heart attack because no you are hedged saints if you're a child of god you're heads and satan can't touch you without god's permissions right right now satan cannot get to you he can't even find you without god's permission without god allowing it and saints if god allows it then there's a reason for it now that's where the that's where the whole misunderstanding thing comes from god i don't know god's ways i don't know god's purpose i don't know what's going to happen down the road i don't know what's going to happen in the next 10 minutes but he does and i trust him in that and wherever it leads me and whatever it costs me and whatever god's will is for me that's what i want god let it be it may be hard it may be a struggle it may be tough but god is in charge and if we believe him and trust him i quote the scripture it's quoted a lot amen but the scripture says that all things will work together for the good of them that love god now the thing with that scripture that a lot of people miss is that it's for those who love god now if you don't love god that scripture is not going to work for you amen and i just say that generally because i believe you all love the lord but that scripture doesn't work if you don't love god because he said they all work together for those that love him now that love is agape love so it's not just a oh god i love you and then go live and do whatever you want the rest of your life or deny the word deny the scripture it doesn't work that way if you love god you're going to obey god to obey god is to obey his word to obey his word is to live his word and if you're living his word it's going to come in your spirit to understand that all things no matter what comes is going to be for my good it's going to be for my benefit god's going to take care of it he's the lord that healeth thee not just your physical but you're spiritual he takes care of us he watches over us the bible says his angels are encamped around about those that love him and fear him amen if those angels are there friend you let that devil try to penetrate that those angels will come forth with those flaming swords and strike their heads off now that's metaphorically in our human vernacular because it doesn't exactly happen that way but those devils have to stay at bay yeah they cannot get to you i cannot i will not succumb to the thought process that i hear today that somehow satan is certain through coven satan is circumventing the will of god no not for his children he's not right absolutely not can't happen won't happen god's in charge not him now this is satan's eating he's in charge of the government and the banking in all this world but he's not in charge of god's children god's in charge of his own children we are amen he's in charge of us so job was hedged satan could not get to him and then when he allowed him to get to him he gave him limitations he said you can do whatever you want to job to jobs what to job's possessions but don't you touch job now did you notice god took a satan took his children took his servants took his animals took his buildings took basically everything but he didn't touch his wife right why did satan not touch job's wife because she was a part of him she was part of job and satan couldn't touch her anymore he could jobs that's why that's why satan couldn't touch the wife because she's a part of job and the command from god was you can do everything that job has but don't touch him she's a part of him so she stayed safe too satan took everything else and then god and then satan come back to god and said well walking to and fro he's have you considered my servant job yeah but i've done this and that so well you've turned to me against him for no reason for no reason i remember that for no reason a lot of people seem to well there's got to be a reason and there's obviously no matter what happens somebody gets sick well there's you know somebody dies off it's got to be because this that and the other there was no reason why god allowed to happen to job what happened to him none not according to the scripture none that god said none that god put his word on that god told job he called job a perfect and upright man right feared god and is stewed or turned aside from evil that was job god had no right there was no correction coming for job like his secret sinner friends would say there was none of that god just what he trusted job and he was using job to prove to the devil that there are people that will stand for god regardless of what happens regardless of what comes upon their lives and in their path nothing can change that praise the lord and thank god i job i love you buddy thank you for the testimony and what you suffered for us to have what we have today to know what we know right god did it for a purpose not that job had done anything wrong but then god said now you can touch job the second time see satan had that limitation you can do all this but don't touch job now you notice the first go around nothing happened to job nothing happened to his wife satan couldn't lay a finger on joe now the second go-round god said you can do whatever you want to job but don't take his life you can't take his life be amazing what you can live through though right you can do anything to him but don't take his life so now god strikes uh safe he strikes joel with sword balls from the top of his hands to the soul of his feet did you imagine joel sitting there on the flesh the heap of his own flesh saying god what is going on what have i done where did i go wrong but see that's just it that's a lot of the times that people had the same thought process god what did i do wrong what happened here nothing it may not have been anything now there's nothing wrong with the question because maybe there is a reason but it isn't always a reason but humanity people we always have to have a reason we got to be able to reason it out friend we got to be able to explain it will this happen because this no no it may not happen for anything other than the fact that it was god's choosing and he's sovereign and he can do what he wants it's his choice he can decide and determine to do whatever he wants to when he wants to how he wants to and does anybody here got a better idea than he does you got a better plan than god you got a better idea than god you got something better than what god can offer there isn't any so we just trust him amen we just trust and believe him now if job if satan now was allowed to touch job now that means that that that satan could do what he wanted you to job but take his life satan was not allowed to take his life and if you ever notice in the scripture all the way through the scripture god's children satan has never god has allowed satan to do things to god to his children god's allowed satan to do things but he's never allowed in the entire bible satan to take one of his children's life that is god's choice that's his decision and his timing never and if it's not a scriptural precedent saints it's not happening today absolutely now when satan touched job sore boils but now notice satan didn't only touch job but he touched job's wife now right because satan got on his wife with an evil spirit and and came up and basically cursed her husband job and said why don't you just curse god with god you're just a miserable man laying there on the heap of your own flesh just curse him and die well that wasn't her normal normally right but a spirit had gotten on her and the reason it is is because god allowed her to allow you touch job so he was allowed to touch him and his wife but now read this now his friends come and notice joe was in such grief that even when his friends were coming up to comfort him they were far off and joe was in such grief they could tell from oh i'm going to say a mile i don't know but they could tell from a distance that he was in despair the anguish that he was going through you read it but i want to get to this now elephants when they come and they're trying to comfort him eliphaz makes this statement now he's quoting scripture here in deuteronomy you know maybe if i have a minute we'll read that scripture because i i want us to see this there's a few scriptures in the bible that that refer to this but he's quoting scripture eliphaz is quoting scripture when he looks at this uh vote job 5 17 behold happy is the man whom god corrected therefore despise not now the chastening of the almighty now that's one of job's comforters and every bit of it is wrong job wasn't being chastised job hadn't done anything wrong see the inference here is that job was the secret sinner that job was doing things he shouldn't have been doing and god's correcting him for that god is giving him a spiritual spanking now that's the inference that elephants is giving him happy is the man who god uh is correcting despised not thou to chase thee god wasn't chastening job it probably felt like it you look at it you say well that's not any different than this and they look the same to me but god wasn't chastening job god wasn't correcting job job in god's eyes was perfect and upright god was just using job to prove to the devil that god has children gonna live for and it's gonna serve him regardless amen he hasn't done anything wrong but you notice the inference see there's got to be that reason well job this all happened to you my friend but there's got to be a reason why it happened what did you do where have you been going lately how have you been acting what secret sins have you been committed this this job there's people get in their minds especially non-spiritual people that this is a result of something else and it wasn't it wasn't a result of something that job had done it wasn't the result of anything job had said or that the how job was living it wasn't a result of any of that understand i said these things happen now you say why then i don't understand then don't try to understand just leave it to god god i love you god i trust you and that's it right and that's where it is that's where it stays and for a child of god with the holy spirit that's all you need that's what you need because that's what gives comfort that's what gives direction and strength job hadn't done anything wrong but in man's mind he had to have or this wouldn't have happened right it's not always that way for him but people will always try to point it to something there's a reason see there was no reason but now look at this now he's right here this is the scripture he's pointing to not not that the scripture was written when he said this i don't mean that but he said 18th verse for he now this is still eliphaz for he god maketh sore and bindeth up he god woundeth and his hands make whole now that is true that is scripture look at uh we'll look at a couple of these scriptures real quick deuteronomy chapter 32. now you don't need to turn there if you don't want i'm just going to read it real quick deuteronomy 32 39 says see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i heal and i make a lie i wound and i heal that's god neither is there any that can deliver me out of my delivered out of my hand who is what is god telling us the the bottom line to this is god is telling us i am god i am in control i do this way i do this way i do it like this he said uh jacob i love and he saw hate for either boy was born who's going to say that's just or unjust looks unjust me as a human but it's not to god not scripturally especially when you break it down and understand why oh praise the lord look god's the one that's in charge god's the one that's in control he's the lord that healeth thee he is the lord that brings the bomb in gilead that takes him and dives down into the spirit where a doctor can't even reach not even a psychiatrist and he can die down in there and he can tweak and he can move and he can make and smooth that the way it's supposed to be in your life because look friend god loves you god wants you happy and joyful god wants you in the perfect condition that you should be in so he can use you so that he can live through you he doesn't want you despaired he doesn't want you down you know a lot of times people get depressed and despaired because their expectations are way up here when god's like don't what we're doing is here not up here and sometimes people get their expectations out of line with the spirit and the move of god's will if we can just get to the blasphemy i believe brother that paul talked about being content finding contentment amen finding contentment is great gain saints when you find contentment there's no there's no discouragement or depression in contentment there's only the the the understanding and the belief the feeling that you're in the the place that where god wants you to be now if you're not living a godly life if you're not born again if you're not one of his god's not in charge of that amen and and if you're not living right if you're not do it that's a whole nother story i'm talking about those that are born again filled with the spirit belong to god and are his charge that's what i'm talking about amen when that place gets there then saying you've got to have that revelation you've got to have that revelation don't ever let the devil think you're not a child of god don't ever let the devil try to deceive you into thinking that you're not one of god you belong to him saint i tell you i believe that with all of us sitting here you're one of gods if you're one of god's then we're just destined to be in that position where god wants us to be so much depression in the world today a lot of times comes because not you here but the social media yeah the expectations oh if i could just act a fool on the uh uh uh on a tick tock or something i could be a millionaire and people are doing it acting i'm sorry i shouldn't use that word but acting like idiots sometimes and risking their lives and all kinds of crazy stupid stuff eating laundry detergent drinking and these are just a few of the things i've heard and i have nothing to do i don't care anything about it but that's just a few of the things i've heard and want to get rich off of it there's a whole new phenomenon today people say what do you do for a living oh i'm a doctor i'm an accountant i'm a lawyer i'm a a cpa i'm an electrician i'm a plumber a a i'm a purchasing agent i'm an engineer whatever nowadays yes you know one out of a hundred people there what do you do oh i'm a i'm a a a social media uh a media person i i'm a star on social media or something it's become an actual vocation that people do and they show these people they got all these riches and the beautiful for naught they get a doctor to take care of that and and all these great grants you see that's what satan tries to offer all these beautiful great grandeur stuff when all these god is hell and death that's all he's really got to offer anybody is death and hell but in this satan's eating and all the great uh looking at all these great things that try to promise everybody this and that and people get these great aspirations and they think well if that aspiration is not met then they get into a place of depression or despair oh my just trust the lord and take what his perfect will is in your life and continue to march on believe god he's with me he's going to take care of me he's with me and this world is not my home in any way amen i have a greater a greater home waiting for me hosea 6 1 come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn the god has god has torn and he will heal us he has torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up praise the lord he will bring us together he will tie us together now there's a couple of different meanings to this bind up i'll i'll say that in a few minutes so i've got another scripture i want to read but god breaks and then he mends remember the the the story of the shepherd uh when one of his sheep gets loose he goes out he'll leave the 90 and nine to go get that one and bring it back into the fold again because that one is just as important as the 99 and if that sheep runs out again he'll go get that sheep and he'll break his leg so he can't do that again but then he'll put him around his arms over his shoulders and he'll mend that sheet back to health and he'll fix his leg and he'll make it all just go back perfect again and then the sheep gets all healed and mended and back in this place it's supposed to be and it keeps them from running again amen now that's chastisement amen that that's a point of chastisement at that point god correcting uh god causing them to keep from going off again going astray but god's the one that tares and he's the one that mends he's the one that heals so many times it affects us in different ways that we may not understand but it's still god in control it's still god in charge it's still god doing it the way he wants us to do it and we just want to succumb to his will lord think about this we sang that song earlier at the cross and in that song it talks about jesus and of course his suffering and what he did for us when he went to california but then my mind as i sing that song and i think about it goes back even before he was crucified before the cross before jesus died physically he walks into the garden of gethsemane he goes for the through the maui that valley where all the blood used from all the sacrifices would run and he goes and he has to walk through this valley to get to that garden and when he gets there of course you can just imagine the humanity of jesus was thinking about all this blood of what he's about to do what he's about to have to go through and jesus went to the garden of gethsemane god built in flesh knelt down and said if it would be thy will let this cup pass for me he asked that how many times have you asked that i know i have lord if it's at all possible please don't let this come god but then in the end he said lord not my will but thou be done right jesus was in such despair that his sweat became as drops of blood now i know some people say and and if you believe it that way that's okay but that he started sweating blood that's not what it says it's it says his sweat became as drops of blood in other words his blood drops off of you know when i got smacked in the face and i bent over blood was just dripping there was drops coming off of my face and i thought that's exactly what the sweat was like coming off of him as he was agonizing over about what he was about to go through about what was about to happen to him but him and his own flesh had to die to himself he had to succumb to what he wanted to happen to allow the will of god to prevail to allow god to move him and bring him to the place of that sacrificial lamb so that all of us could receive redemption so that all of us could receive the holy ghost one time it was just him all of it the fullness of the godhead body was in christ but he had to go and shed that blood the life he had to go shed that life that was in the blood it wasn't necessarily the chemistry of the blood although that redeemed the earth back this physical earth the blood of christ dropped on it to redeem it back but the light that was in the blood had to come forth and come on to every believer ever since that happened and that life that was in the blood now is what we holds and sustains us and keeps us where we're supposed to be filled with his spirit because once what was in him is now in us amen we get to the same place his flesh did sometimes amen jesus lived without sin didn't he the bible said he was without sin he did no wrong so even when he was in the garden of gethsemane and he was questioning and he was asking god let this cup pass for me that was not a sinful act you understand so asking the proverbial why is not a sin it's not a transgression against god it wasn't even an act of unbelief because jesus was sinless perfect and he did the same thing he asked the same question so you asking that same question does it make you a non-believer doesn't make you a sinner it doesn't take you down and god's wrong a notch which that's what some people would say god doesn't have notches but some people think that god doesn't bring you down or chastise you that's unbelief no that's not it's just your manatee your humanity is questioning god why lord why and i don't know about you but i've had several wives in my life most of them god's never answered that i could recall some of them you can look back and say well maybe why this has happened maybe this is why this happened i know my wife went through a lot until she was well until she met me then she really went through a lot but not until after she married me and this you really went through a lot but when she was younger up until six years old till the time she was adopted she went through a lot and then after she was adopted went through a lot and you think why but see even when she was in that place god was giving her visions god was showing her dreams she saw these she didn't even understand it of course she's a little girl can you imagine three four years old seeing something of these old people coming in and saying who are these old gray-haired people there's nothing here nuns but a bunch of little kids well the women that would that would turn out to be the people that adopted her she runs when they come in because she shot she goes runs under a table so that the girls that they wanted to adopt as a little baby doll for couldn't couldn't see her and she was considered unadoptable at the time so the the girl that come in they want to get her her as a baby doll for her come in and she was shot the girl was shot so when she saw sonya hiding at the table she thought she was shy too even though she's not my wife's quite an extrovert she's not shot but because she was hiding under the table the girl thought she was shy and she said i want her well most people come in want a little little baby she's two or three years old considered unadoptable at that point and she did something that was out of character but it was exactly what god had orchestrated to bring her to the place she needed to be you know understand all those things and then you think god why did it have to be this way and then in my early ministry i used to have her to come up because ministers would ask me you mind if your wife would give her testimony i said oh she loved to you know 15 20 minutes whatever it was she'd come up and so many people were blessed just by their testimony of what she had gone through and i say that because it reminds me back of job again and why and what everything job went through what a blessing has been to so many people ever since i know it has me job if you didn't go through this for anybody else but for me thank you buddy i'm glad she showed me something she went through a lot but it blessed a lot of people her testimony people would come up to arrive to church tears rolling and thank her for for her testimony it meant so much to him see you don't know why god does certain things and sometimes the proverbial wild never be answered maybe on the other side but it's like the song we're saying friend when you get on the other side you probably don't care anyway someone said when i get there i'm gonna go ask jesus why no no thank you god that i'm here no wise no worries i i'm not questioning god i'm just thankful to be here if i'm the foot if i'm the doormat at the front door that's as long as i'm here amen i'll be glad i made it all those wives will just disappear they'll just kind of go away it won't really matter but in our humanity and our flesh here so many times it's exactly what comes in our minds but he's the lord that heals he binds the wounds look at these psalms another man that knows a lot about wounds um if you've read my book you see what uh a little what david went through especially by the hand of saul but not only saw his own son absalom what david went through but look at this in the psalm 147 um verse three let's just start reading verse one praise ye the lord for it is good to sing praises unto our god amen for it is pleasant and praise is comely the lord built up jerusalem he gathered together the outcasts of israel he healeth the broken in heart amen the heart the spirit the spiritual healing he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds binded them now the body that we read a minute ago refers to because it has the dual purpose meaning here if you look it up you'll see the buying binder has a dual purpose meeting that binding is say well you take something and you bind it up is it's like when joel had his surgery when they got done with the surgery they bound his wound up but there's also another reference to this binding because when it comes to the heart you don't take the heart and wrap it with with gauze or with a an ace bandage or something not the heart so what do you do god binds up that wound of the heart how does he do that he restrains in other words he holds back he keeps back or he binds that wound so that it's not so hurtful in your heart see not so hurtful in your spirit that binding means like uh like well let's just go back to the dog again if there's a little kid in here and a mean dog that wanted to hurt you well if that dog could get at you he would but if you take that dog and you bind him up you understand you restrain him he can't get to you and that's another binding aspect that goes into the spiritual healing of the spiritual wounds he binds them so that it doesn't hurt as bad and that's when we when we go to the lord and we have trust in him he binds and holds back that wound the hurt of that wound so that it doesn't it doesn't affect you as bad it doesn't hurt as badly because we trust in god my mom passed away two years ago march this coming march my dad spent almost 30 years my sister 19 1993 my brother not long after that i mean i got my son in 1989 i've got so many of my family waiting on the other side for me but each time because of him and multiple things that's happened in our lives in our married lives with our children grandchildren i mean there's been so many things and i just say this because i identified with myself you identify with yourself amen we all have to identify with ourselves i identify that with myself i can give my example because i lived it but when it happened i it's hard yes and i have asked why many times but then when it boils down i'd say thank you lord jesus for whatever purpose whatever reason you've got this for god you're going to take care of it right here to take care of me you're going to take care and bind this from my spirit i miss my mom dearly i can't even begin to tell you how dearly how to post a picture of us when we were up back there all of us and went back and i just started bawling because i pissed her but i know she's in a better place yes and that's not hyperbole saints that's just the truth it's just fact that's not something just to help me get by from day to day right it's not just uh some phrases you stick in no it's reality then i know she's better off now even though i miss her but that that wound in my spirit gets bound and restrained because of the realization that i have that she's in the arms of the lord that i'm going to meet her be with her again sometimes i visualize my family because you know we're not far from that my opinion right i believe the rapture is so close friend our loved ones are going to start appearing and i start visualizing seeing my parents come but when i start visualizing it i don't see my mom as she passed i see her in the pictures i remember when she was 20 years old my dad when he was 20 years old my sister got pictures my son my brother i got pictures i visualized i can see them at that age now my son i have a hard time with because he was only a day and a half old that one's a little tougher kind of have an idea but that was a little tougher but in my mind's eye that wound gets bound it gets restrained because of the the fact that i know that we're going to be together again and it won't be that long it won't be that much longer amen i i i first of all i don't have that many more years left on this earth i'm on the waning side of this life not as waning as some of you but way more waning than many of you as i look at the young ones in the back but even at that even if by the way of the grave we're just we're getting older and i'll tell you this and i'll i'm gonna close but it hit me hard i say hard in a different way when i turn 56 i don't know why or what came about in my life but all of a sudden i remembered brother branham was 56 when he passed away and that hit hard i started thinking my and then i started thinking the same thing he did if you're going to do anything you better get busy your days on this earth are numbered my friend but i believe the rapture's that close too amen i believe the rapture is that close too but it becomes a reality at that point and then you really start thinking god what what god is doing for us amen what god is doing for us let me read this the masterpiece give to us the desires of our heart for we truly have these desires to serve you and these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that put us that are put upon us sometimes to perfect us we've been told that he said think it not strange that these trials come they're only working out for our good and to perfect us and to bring us into that place these great deserts of experiences where righteous men are molded into saints molded into saints molded into the character and the image that christ would have for us to be i think we're so close to that time though i gotta be honest and there may be another message in this i'm not sure but i think it's coming to the place that we're getting so close to to the coming of the lord that that what we're witnessing is is the final preparations that's going on the final preparations that are happening i had that in my mind the other day i told you before that all the people that are going people that we know friends family oh young some coveted some not different other things the lord's taking so many and again probably not even half of them with coleman so many other things reason that people are going passing on and so many i've never seen it to the place that it's been where so many have been going and i and yesterday and because i've said i don't know but yesterday it just came to me it made me think that this could very well be those final preparations the lord is making before he takes the alive and remain group before the dead raised and we go home it's winding itself up is that a par again i'll say this as i said earlier is that a part of that squeeze that brother bannon refers to now he talks about the squeeze coming from the ecumenical council but he also talked about the bride's not going to be going through a bunch of punishment but is that the preparation that's bringing us to that place are we so late that all these things happening and look god has blessed us so much in this church and god has been so good to us and i told you there's been so many miracles testimonies every one of us could stand right now and tell testimonies and miracles of things that's god's done for us in the past year or two right amen amen but look in the past and we came up and prayed about it but look in the past three months four months six months of the things there's not been any there's not been any of us unaffected by some adverse things taking the place in our lives and our families everybody everybody in here amen everybody all of us illnesses diseases hospitalizations operations passing on i won't say death because they're not dead brother angel brother charlie sicknesses people that have been not able to come it's affected all of us all of us in some way shape or form every one of us our families have been affected by it and look friend sometimes people look at that from the outside and say oh that's the cursings of god friend i look at it and say oh that's the blessings of god you say how could that be the blessings of god that's because god loves us and he's getting us in the position and shaping us and creating us into that image that he wants us to speak because we're about to go home that's my view of it that's the way i see it people say well that's a cursing of you you shouldn't go there you shouldn't even go to that church and there are people in this city that tell others that come here they shouldn't go here don't ever proselyte anybody's saints in the bible one person jesus talked about was a proselyte he said he's threefold more child the hell he was to start with that's nothing good spoken about it a proselytization in the bible that's of the devil but is the truth it's absolute truth and other people will look at it and think that's a curse no it's not it's not a curse i i think it's a blessing i think it's just god because he's mindful see because if you if you don't belong to god god just leaves you alone right i don't want to say he doesn't care but again who does who does tap to yell out in the backyard when when the kids are misbehaving it's joel not the other boys i i don't want to say god doesn't care about the rest of them but those aren't his children sir you are amen that's the way i see it amen god the lord that heals all of our diseases and i tell you as much as i was disturbed because i was looking so forward to having brother charlie nearing our church that chuck's testimony helped me a lot it did because i've been in tears this week over that and i appreciate that brother charlie that meant a lot to me not that i didn't believe that but when you hear a testimony like that and from his own son it just speaks volumes amen does to me did to me anyway witness to me what a blessing that is god's in charge of saints yes god's in charge of his children satan he's not in charge of his god's children satan's not out here taking god's children from this earth absolutely not not allowed to do it it's not scriptural amen can't do it now god's in charge of that praise the lord and how do we know any one of us could be the next one before the rapture i don't know i don't i'm trusting not i hope not that's my desire i hope not but then again when it come right down to it jesus finally had to say lord not my will but thou be done amen let's stand if we could is working a masterpiece in his bride yes she's to be the perfect image of him ready to take that rapture sometimes i feel like we maybe speak of that rapture a little differently than maybe we should kind of as an offshoot you know all the raptures here the rapture is coming the rapture's at hand but friend to me is so much more than that for a rapture to ever happen his bride internationally and some people say well they don't act like it well maybe they're not a part of it i don't put anybody in or take anybody out that's god's decision but i know god's people at god's time in god's way are going in a rapture regardless who is in it regardless not who in it who's not in it god it's going to happen amen i just want to be ready help money lord to get ready whatever it takes to eat in all of our lives lord i want to be ready amen praise the lord i don't want to be the one that's the hindrance let's sing this little course here if we can here we go worship the lord a little bit before we go amen god is so good to us he cares for you amen
