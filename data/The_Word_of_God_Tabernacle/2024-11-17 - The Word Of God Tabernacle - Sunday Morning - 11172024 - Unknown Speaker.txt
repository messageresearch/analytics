I'm still here praise the Lord Jesus praise the Lord try to trace your footsteps it's kind of to look back and think where would I have been what God has did the turn here and the change here and the foring the road there and the crossroad and which way do I go what do I do and God always makes it work amen regardless of uh of any of our failures and mistakes and any of it he makes a way for us all toess this batt I can't even imagine I think back when I was just Joel's age we first came in this message and truth and I knew in my heart it was always something it always right I knew it was right I knew Jesus Christ I worshiping and serving God was right I always knew that and it wasn't because of the house I grew up in either uh that helped me I'm thankful for that am but I know I know now that that was already in me amen before the foundation of the world God placed that seat in me I knew it already we knew it and I you know and I say that because I know that identifies and witnesses to you all as well prise amen and U some it may have took a little longer but I knew my whole life and I just I knew I didn't serve it didn't want to serve it my flesh riled against it many times but in me I knew it was right always knew it was right amen never expected to preach uh could have seen a look on my wife's face when that happened uh she's like I never I never I never bargained to marry a preacher I wasn't bargaining to preach so we're kind of in the same boat here but we do what we can for the glory of the Lord and what he puts in our lives and what he has us to do that's what we can do amen yes praise the Lord I'm thankful God is good like like a bad but I just have a little and I'm fine amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus well Joel if you weren't if you didn't have some bumps and bruises I wouldn't think you were a boy I mean that does that come in the territory bumps and bruises come in the territory when you're a little boy amen sometimes when you're little girls too buten mostly when you rambun as little boy they just come they come of the territory amen so let's stand to our feet if we could we'll go to the scripture here and turn into First Kings with me first Kings the 21st chapter First Kings 21 read a couple of verses of scripture and let you be seated delve into the story here a little a little bit and get to a specific point we've made this point before but recognizing that uh all things will come to pass amen amen some things may come to pass after we're gone we don't know uh depending on what it is or us specifically but all all things all prophecy will come to pass all that the Lord has put all the Lord has spoken it will come to pass amen praise the Lord that's um that's the word of the Lord yes amen First Kings chapter 21 uh we'll start with we'll just start with verse 17 to begin and then um and then we'll go back but let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer we good Lord Jesus we're so very thankful again father of this beautiful place you've give us for this time to come together Lord in out of the world as the world is shoving us out more and more Lord but we're not upset about that we never were part of the world to begin with but Lord we're so thankful father that you've give us a place to come and just learn of you and to meet with you and expect you Lord to be here as you always are God this is your house we are here Lord as your honored guest to to worship and to praise you father that's what the guest does when he comes into the honor the man's house of honor is they give him honor we bring honor into your house we bring sacrifices of worship and praise to you Lord this doesn't belong to us it belongs to you God and all that we do we want to worship worship and praise you in it father may your Holy Spirit move in a special way now Supernatural way God as you through your word father would speak to our hearts and show us in here God the things that we would need to know Lord for us today and for our walk with you and Lord just to draw closer to you have faith Lord our our faith increased and Lord just to be more like you father as we go out that door today if it Be Your Will then when we came through that door God we just rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hind or and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done God we commit this service to you what the purpose is you've set it forth before God we know that in your mind before the foundation of the world you saw this service unfold father it was a purpose to it for all of us God that all of us have made an effort to come here Lord there's a purpose for us for everyone God let that purpose be manifested today as your word will not rorn void let it come into our hearts and let it continue to cultivate in US Lord that true Spirit Lord that true life that we desire so much more to be more and more every day Grant it today father as we commit it to you the blessings of your word every request every need that was made known we commit it to you now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen now First Kings chapter 21 we'll begin with verse 17 and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to me Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he uh behold he is in the vineyard of nabal Wither he is gone down to possess it Thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place where dogs lick the blood of nabal shall dogs lick thy blood even thine and Ahab said to Elijah hast thou Found Me Oh My Enemy and he answered I have found thee because thou has sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord behold I will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that shut uh shut up and uh and left in Israel and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nabat and like the house of Bop the house of ahaja for for the provocation wherewith thou has provoked me to anger and made Israel to sin and of Jezebel also spake the Lord saying the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of jezrael and you could be seated if you'd like want to start back with this story we all probably know it heard it read it um heard it ministered on a little bit but I want particularly to recognize uh sort of a an extension of what we talked about the other day couple of services and even brother no hit on it a little bit to recognize that uh first of all we know everybody plays their part yes amen everybody in the world plays their part whether it's uh a a part that is less pleasurable whether it's a part that puts ones to death whether it's a part that uh uh uh puts uh uh puts you under persecution whatever we all have our part to play whether it's a part uh that is detrimental to the gospel if it's a part that is a church or a Ministry that is harmful to the message everyone has their part to play yes everybody amen brother bam said Hitler had a part to play he said Stalin had a part to play amen and God did not stop those men until they were done with what God needed to be done yes amen and we know the fulfilling the Fulfillment of the scripture that was brought about in that uh uh uh in what the Lord did there amen we know what scripture had to be brought about and Israel had to be driv back to their Homeland and all that God did to bring it about for the script scripture to be fulfilled amen and the scripture will be fulfilled every letter of it every word of it it will be F if it has not it will be fulfilled there's not one word in here that will go unfulfilled it will happen amen and this that God is sending Elijah down to prophesy and as we read this part of the of the instruction that God gave to uh to Elijah in two specific separate places he God says Elijah you tell him Ahab thus saith the Lord amen amen now that's not a man it better not be uh that's not a human that's not a man if it is that man needs to make his heart right because he's a liar he's Satan possessed and needs to come to the altar but when you say thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord you speak in the name of the Lord that is coming from the Throne of God that is God using you as his instrument to speak and he told him twice in this specific instance you tell him thus sayith the Lord this is going to happen thus sayith the Lord this is going to happen that's why you saw brother brandom the word prophet of today a true Prophet a true prophet's word a word prophet's true word come to pass amen trust me California will sink yes amen I know the curse was on LA California will sink brother brandom talks about the West Coast even California will sink we know the things that have come to pass in the prophecy and the things that's been spoken God never promised brother brandom specifically that these things would happen while he was here thankfully of the encouragement that God gave to brother brandom several of the things that the lord gave him did happen several of even the Sevenfold Vision that God gave brother B actually came to pass amen we know that and we know that California is going to sink we know the things that that God has done and Prov and shown those things will happen this will happen God told Elijah go tell Ahab this is going to happen what was it thus sayith the Lord the dogs are going to lick your blood where you killed and allowed nabos blood to be to be spilled amen the dogs will lick your blood in that exact same place amen and thus sayth the Lord for your Jezebel wife she will be eaten by the dogs by the wall of jezrael thus sayeth the Lord now that's going to happen amen speaking inside the story we know it's already happened but speaking inside the story at that specific time we know as Elijah spoke that to Ahab it was going to happen period now Ahab didn't think anything about it apparently he just called see you notice how he addressed Elijah he said uh hast thou Found Me Oh My Enemy well if you weren't an enemy of God you wouldn't be an enemy of God's people right if you weren't an enemy of God you would not be an enemy of God's prophet right if you're a if you are a friend of God's Prophet then you would be a friend of God you notice the difference he but see he couldn't differentiate the two he's he's thinking I'm in good standing with God but he hates God's man Elijah who spoke only what God Said speak amen amen praise the Lord there's another one we know we'll talk about again in a minute but look at the story as we go through it you see uh um I I I I I can read through it I can preface it but or I could paraphrase it but the Story begins back at the first verse 21st chapter of course the story starts for this specific thing and it came to pass verse uh 21 and one now and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a Vineyard which was in jezrael hard by the place of Ahab king of Syria and uh or Samaria excuse me and Ahab spake unto nabal saying give me thy Vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near un my house and I will give for uh give thee for it a better Vineyard than it or if it seem Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth of it in money well that sounds fair amen but it wasn't it it wasn't ahab's to buy it was nabos to sell it's not up to Ahab it's up to nabal and nabal said to Ahab the Lord forbid it me the Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance my posterity she or my inheritance of my fathers to be even unto a posterity the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and Ahab anybody that was a Godly person at that time knew Ahab was crooked yes and knew that he had caused all Israel to fall into sin but there were godly people as there always are amen just in this leodan church age that has fallen into the disarray and of course the scripture the ne the the lukewarmness that has fallen into even though that last Circle that brother random drew that God said was that that it was completely black out there was still a little sliver of light in there because there's still going to be some of God's people in there amen so even though all of Israel had blackened out there were still some people that were in there that were godly people people of Integrity people that had a a a a grasp on understanding their Heritage and where they came from and and and what their inheritance was it meant something to them it wasn't just a train it wasn't just something that you go uh like brother Tom does to the to the gym show or something and buy and trade and like Mah does buy and trade gems and and this and and horse trade and bargain and sell a little this for this to try to get this maybe make a little money off this there was no bargaining here this was his inheritance this belonged to his family this belonged to his father and God forbade if you will forbade uh nabbo from selling that thing to s that Vineyard his inheritance to such a wicked man as Ahab amen so so Ahab so NE said God has forbidden me to sell you my Vineyard and the fourth verse and Ahab came out of his house heavy and displeased because of the word which nabot the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said I will give I will not give Thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed turned his away his face and would not eat no bread now that's pretty much what I did when I was six right and didn't get my way right when I was a little child and didn't get my way I would throw a temper tantrum amen I didn't specifically but I know as a child we would get all upset didn't get my way so I'm going to pout I'm going to go lay on my bed in a ball and stare at the wall like a child I'm not going to even eat dinner I refuse my dinner no bread no water I'm just going to ball up in a ball here and I'm just going to be a little baby and I'm going to Suk as the king of Israel I'm an assault over the fact that nabbo won't sell me his Vineyard what a baby what a child right what a horrible example of a leader in the situation the person the man that was over all of Israel uh was so infantile to to walk away and not get his way so much that he I'm not eating and suck over the fact that nebot wouldn't sell him his Vineyard I it's a pretty pitiful it kind of explains the rest of what's going on too cuz you know what you got here in Ahab you got to spoil brat that's what you got it needss a good whooping yes I mean might get trouble that's the truth though he just needs a good whooping amen uh probably maybe a little too late now and then he married then he doubled it up and he married a spoiled brat who always got her way who needed probably more than a whoop um and the two of them made a marriage and the two of of them now over the Kingdom of Israel right a horrible sight but he amen deserving of a whooping decided to go and lay in the bed turn his face against the wall and refuse to eat anything so Jezebel comes to him fifth chapter fifth verse but Jezebel his wife came to him and we know the kind of woman Jezebel was amen we know the kind of person that she was she did the things she did because of her character notice that a lot of people talk about making and all this stuff and calling Jezebel makeup and I know what brother brandham said but I want you to get to the root to understand what brother brandham said Absolut amen a jezebel is a dominating female Spirit that's what a jezebel is Right amen she did what she did because of her because of her character amen she lived the way she lived and produced herself because she was uh she was that type of woman amen that's why she did it she's a jezebel and you say a jezebel it doesn't mean that she wears jeans or cuts her hair or whatever I mean those can be attributes of it uh but paint her face all up that can be attributes of it but uh but a jezebel is a dominating female Spirit that's what a jezebel is amen so this so it it characterizes her in this story better his wife came to him Jezebel said unto him why is thy spirit so sad and thou eatest no bread and he said unto her because I uh spake unto nabo the jezreelite and said unto him give me my give me thy Vineyard for money or else if it please Thee I will give thee another Vineyard for it and he answered I will not give thee my Vineyard now can you imagine the suling and the Weeping and the clearing of the throat and the whole he wouldn't give me my V wanted the vineyard he wouldn't give me you can only imagine what the story is like amen but Jezebel now seventh verse Jezebel's wife said to him does thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel in other words you're the king of Israel you can take whatever you want right amen by proper means by legal means by ethical means or Not by ethical means or moral means but the bottom line is you're the king you can do whatever you want there you go that that's that's exactly the mentality of a spoiled brat you can do whatever you want no you can't you re you really can't uh I know that flies in the face of a lot of modern day thinking but you really can't not not with God Amen not get away with it amen people say well well if you can do whatever you want then you just go in the jewelry store here at the mall just take everything you got walk out and go home P it on eBay or wherever you want to make a ton of money build a big house have a big car and you just do whatever you can't do whatever you want right amen but when you're in this position like this as a childish mentality who a spoiled brat now in power you talk about you talk about uh Power without character being satanic I mean this is pretty much the epitome of having having power without character to rule it with amen are you not the go the governor of all the Kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread and let thy heart be married I will give the The Vineyard of nabbo the jezreelite now look who's responsible amen right amen look who's responsible it's his wife it's ahab's wife mean Jezebel is ahab's wife I mean I know she's a separate individual but he god holds Ahab responsible for her actions right amen so eth verse so she wrote letter now she wrote letters I'm going I'll say Ahab actually but now again who's responsible see but she wrote letters in ahab's name sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the Elders of the no and the Nobles that were in the city dwelling with nabal and she wrote in the letter saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people and and set two men sons of Bal yeah it tells you we've already gone over what the sons of bilar was and the the the uh the uh Antichrist or anti the anti-god uh uh godlessness of Bilo amen so we know what kind of men she's asking to be set up as judges set up sons of Bilal before him to Bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme God and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die that is Jezebel's instructions there there's there's nothing righteous to this there's there's nothing that nabo has done to hold him guilty of this he has not done this he's Guiltless of this crime but yet she's sending forth through again illegal immoral unethical means to murder this man right to Murder She didn't throw a stone but she murdered him Ahab didn't throw a stone but he murdered him through his wife amen carry him out that he may die Stone him that he may die 11 verse and the men of and the men of his City even the elders and the Nobles who were the inhabitants in this in his city did as Jezebel had sent them sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them and they proclaimed a fast amen and set naboth on high among the people you notice just setting a fast or you you can see how the things that God had set in place to be a a a a religious a spiritual experience needful for the people and to reach God the festivals and and and the sacrifices and and the fasts all those things were set in place by God so that it would it would help try to bring God and his people together and in in more of a celebration and unity together this fast was meant to be a spiritual thing not it wasn't meant to be placed in a position of a facade if you will to make it put on an air like we are performing the actual spiritual ritual uh that that God had set forth through Moses we're going to perform that to to try to legitimize the Cracker Jack court that they're about to hold against Neal and there is no Court here because the man is Innocent but they're going to kill him anyway so there is no court there is no truth there is no justice but they're figing a religious symbol of holding a fast to make it look like something that's Godly you notice how that is so rampant anymore Saints to make it try to look like or symbolize is something that God is pleased with when it couldn't be is a billion miles from God nothing even resembling close to something that's godliness but let's just do this let's hold this fast we'll make it look to the people like it's legitimate like it's something that's a religious uh ordinance is taking place no it's not it's it's two men by the instruction of a jezebel to go and wrongfully murder Mur a man who has done nothing wrong just to take his property amen now you think that you think that sets quite right in God's core you think that sets quite right in God's mind but you see a lot of the same thing happening today oh it must be of God because of so and so well this must be God we held a fast this this is happening has got to be the will of the Lord because we had prayer meeting every Wednesday night oh that's that's a nice and I have nothing is prayer meeting but when you come across just trying to make something look like a symbol of something so that it's going to present itself uh in it's in its front form like it's something that's Godly what what amen you can't make something look by like it's God by putting a religious symbol on it amen and then call it God that's right and saying it's Godly or saying it's the will of God it doesn't work that way tell Ahab later in the story as we get to it that amen because he found out real quick as we already know what his Pro we already know what his Doom is because it's been prophesied we already read that part but you you ask him and see if he had not preferred listening to a a a Godly Man and being a friend of God instead of an enemy of God but you notice they put it's a fast so that that legitimizes it that legitimizes an innocent man's murder because they hold a fast because it looks Godly now this is the ritual right that we're supposed to take to make it look like it's it's on the up and up oh God amen hypocrisy in its rawest form but it's true and it happens so much Saints and people hold forth things and say oh this is this is godliness my mind help us Lord I'm going to move on from that amen they proclaimed a fast and set nth on high among the people and there came and there came in two men children of Bal sat down before him and the men of Bilo witnessed against him even against nabo in the presence of the people saying saying Nebo did blaspheme God and the King Then They Carried him forth out of the city and stone him with stones till that he died just because of the witness of those two men because of the witness of those ungodly men amen those devil worshippers those Satan possessed individuals because of the witness of to a a good Godly honest man was put to death because of that for doing nothing wrong nothing wrong now they put him to death now people think oh I get away with it it's okay nothing's happened to me amen but look who does God hold responsible he didn't say anything about in his even in his uh uh prophecies God didn't say anything about these two men he didn't say anything about the city he didn't say anything about them the fast setting Nebo he didn't say anything about that he said you tell Ahab thus sayth the Lord you don't go to the town you don't go to those men don't even go to Jezebel you tell Ahab it's his responsibility he's the one in charge he's the one responsible you tell Ahab tell him thus sayith the Lord because you did this I'm I then they sent to Jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead and he came to pass when uh Jezebel heard that nabbo was stoned and that he was dead that Jezebel said to Ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of Nebo the Israelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not de alive but dead and it came to pass when Ahab heard that naboth was dead that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of nabbo the jezreelite to take possession of it it's like the kid who had his face against the wall and somehow sulking in the little in this little fetal position that he finally comes out and he and Jezebel here say here's a sucker yay I got a sucker or or or somebody ice cream I get some ice cream I I have now he comes out and he's all happy cuz he's got his possession amen did he ask how it happened well it doesn't say so in the scripture does he even question Jezebel doesn't say in the scripture right all he cares is he's got his sucker he's got his lollipop now he's got his fullow of ice cream he's good now he can come out of the fetal position with his face against the wall and try to act like some semblance of a man again he's finally got his pricee he's got his Vineyard but at what price at what price God told Elijah thus say the Lord Ahab the dogs will lick your blood where nabos was amen thus sayith the Lord look for it's going to happen yes it it might not be in five minutes might not be in 5 days might not be in 5 years but it's going to happen yes it is because the prophet spoke because the word Prophet Elijah spoke and it's going to happen amen it will happen praise the Lord let's go over to uh the 22nd verse or 22nd chapter 22nd chapter let's start at the sixth verse now they've got a time this is three years later I think three years it says three years of peace between Syria and Israel so I'm I'm assuming in that time is that transition time it's about a threeyear period now it's gone by and josphat goes down to Israel the king of uh uh the the king of Judah josphat goes down to C Ahab king of Israel and while they're talking Elijah Ahab says uh you know rou Gilead that belonged us that's part of our land and Syria is holding on to it wrongfully it doesn't belong to them belongs to us you know what he was right Ahab was actually right that property that piece it actually did belong to Palestine it belonged to Israel it was their possession it was a part of the land that God gave them he is right it's true he said but Syria sets up there enjoying the land that is our inheritance now look friend you can't have it both ways you can't have it and say well you know this is God's word but I don't like this and I don't like this and I don't like this and I don't like this and you just start ripping Pages or you start blacking out it doesn't work like that Ahab is willing to take nabos Vineyard by uh by death he's he's willing to cause Israel to uh to sin and to C commit adultery against God but yet when it comes to the righteousness the truth which is true and right he says but now that's our land yes it's true and if you were in the right position and if you were the right man and if this was the right time God would send you forth to go get it but Ahab looks at Jehosaphat he says that's ours I'll go get it if you'll come with me jles says absolutely I'm with you my men are your men my horses are your horses let's go but shouldn't we inquire with God about this because God didn't give him instruction to go God didn't tell them yeah it belongs to them but God didn't say ramoth Gilead has been in the hands of the syrians long enough it's time you go gu guys go get it he didn't say that he didn't send Elijah down there to say you go tell Ahab it's time to take possession of Ramo Gilead back into Israel again you go and as you go into Syria that those men will be as can stalks they'll fall before you right amen and you will take it and possess it but God didn't tell him this is Ahab see Ahab again the spoil brat thinks he can have anything he wants Now understand it does belong to them but he wants to do it on his own ability he wants to do it out of his own pride and he doesn't care whose life it costs he doesn't care what happens to his men or to jehoshaphat's men let's go get it at the instruction of me or the instruction of God and jeat had just enough brother Rand said he had just enough God in him to say shouldn't we consult God first and they has good idea let's do that I got four 400 prophets top that one I bet you can't find more than 400 prophets I got 400 prophets go get them and bring them here amen and every one of those 400 prophets that's a lot of men that's a lot of prophets Saints that's a lot of professing prophets that's a lot of hiring prophets if you know what what I mean there's tons of hireling prophets but one true word Prophet amen amen there's plenty of hireling prophets out there 400 I got 400 of go get them okay great we'll have them come in here they'll they'll speak before us and tell us and they all come forth every one of them amen and as they start coming forth a uh Ahab and jehos spat and they start uh telling us y it's fine go up you're going to take it next one come along yep you're great God be with you you're going to take the land next 400 how many how long would that even take I'd get so bored of every single one of 400 people coming up and say yeah you got it go get it the Lord's given it to you 400 two hours of sheer boredom yes just listening to One after the other yep you got it go get it the Lord's with you yep you got it go get it Lord's with you so on one after the other 400 and jat says you know what Ahab I just something not said right with me do you maybe have one more one more that we could really in inquire of the Lord with just just one More's like I didn't why are you asking me that I just shoveled 400 before you every one of them in perfect Unison to tell us to go take it to do it it's our land go do it 400 you want one more yeah just just just something just if you just got one more if it just is there just one more and they have finally relented and said yeah yeah yeah yeah there there's one more guy out there but I hate him I I hate him why do you hate him so Ahab he's always speaking evil against me well why is he doing that Ahab because everything you do is against God and everything this man says is PR God so of course everything that he says is against you because everything you do is against God right hello amen you think someone eventually would wake up and smell the roses smell the coffee smell something cuz there's something the fair is going on if one man who always spoke in the name of the Lord that actually came to pass and what came to pass was against me I would I would start to maybe a little common sense and say well maybe God's against me and if God's against me why I want to find out I don't only want to find out I want to change it I want to fix it I want to make things right with God no see but there's so many people out there that don't and a prideful person is the hardest nut to crack right a prideful spoiled brat is the hardest nut to crack you can't hardly ever get that person to see that they need to repent be humble and give their heart to God Amen they're too entitled that's right they think they can they think they own deserv and should get everything and everybody else should bow down around them but isn't there just one more I yeah there's one more but I hate him Jos fat oh don't say so can you go get get it the king called night first the king of Israel called an officer said hasten hither Micah the son of emblem oh you're in for it now king of Judah uh the king of Israel and Jehosaphat the king of Judah set each on his throne having put on their robes the void place the entrance of the gates of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them zedekiah even the head Prophet the head hirling come up and said the son of Chan made his horns of iron and said it actually a symbols of the Prophet see horns of iron this is another religious symbol what does this do it's again to fool you into thinking this is some Godly Expedition God is not in this outside of the fact that he's orchestrating everything around to make sure that all the stuff that happens all around you comes and brings you right back to the place that you die and the dogs Leck your your blood not just lick your blood but the exact same spot that they did NEOS because that's the prophecy amen amen wow every bit of the circumstance has to be worked out to bring it that's the only part God is playing in this he is not what they have amen go up now zedi the son of the the son of Chan had those ORS of iron iron he said thus said now zedekiah says thus sayith the Lord you are a liar you want me to tell you where Liars go Liars find their place in hell that's where Liars go amen I I I'm probably a bit dramatic about that but I get so sick of the lying that goes on around the world today yes people don't think anything about lying anymore they care nothing they lot you used to be I think you used to be put on a l I think half the people in this world would pass the lighter Tech test today because that doesn't mean anything to them anymore used to mean something so when it means something I know I'm getting down a rabbit holes here but I got something to say you know used to be when when uh uh you you a person would lie they would they knew it was wrong and their body would react and it would and it would react on this machine and tell them said that person is lying I I bet you probably half the people in this world today could lie and not even not even trip a a li T right because it doesn't mean it's second nature anymore they don't care it doesn't matter to them in fact I wonder if a lot of people even recognize you're even lying right and if there's anything even wrong with it people of God where they justify actions so readily that it doesn't matter what they do anymore it's Justified oh they're just stealing a $1,000 worth it's okay it's Justified because they've been oppressed really let's see how oppressed when I'll just say personally when I'm slaving myself out on a job working to make a little money to pay some rent and pay the power bill and put a little food in my tummy how about you come do that yeah oh no too enti for that I shouldn't have to do that I just go into the store and steal everything and then every and everybody make excuses well they lied well what's the excuse for that you know and of course politics is the epitome I I mean politics is I I know there's probably some good people there friends but politics is a place where most people go to uh enhance their lying skills I I just think the greater far majority uh most of are just and the weird part of it is this side is calling them a bunch of liars and this side's calling them a bunch of liars that's you want to talk about the you want to talk about the epitome of a pot calling a kettle black yeah right it's just it it's like I said the other day look usually usually when someone's harping and pounding on something you know why cuz they're usually the ones guilty of it great amen that's usually true amen that's the way of the devil though see because he he knows especially you as Christians you keep your front door guarded but he wants to try to sneak in that back if he can just get a wedge on the back door and try to come in that way amen that's that's exactly what he tries to do bring that to bring that spirit in there right amen but zedekiah friend zedekiah is just flat out liar right you know what brother random said about those men who try to prophesy or come forth in the name of the Lord say thus sayith the Lord it doesn't happen he said they need to go get prayed for because they've got a devil on them amen that's pretty Stark but it's the truth he said thus sayth the Lord he's lying God hasn't told him anything but he said it thus sayith the Lord anybody can say it thus sayith the Lord with thee shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to G rth Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall deliver into the king's hand and the messenger that was gone to call Michael spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good now look uh this messenger first of all my all these 400 prophets Micah they've all they've all spoke good they've all spoke good of the king and we want you to speak exactly the same way speak only what is good you know what that's exactly what he did to most people the word good is a relative term because what's good to you might not be good to me Micah like Micah thinks Sushi is good I don't amen so that's a relative term he might say let's go get something good I say yeah that's great he pulls into a sushi restaurant I'm like I thought you said good see it's relative but in truth the word God good is not a relative term because the only one that is good is God amen amen God is the good standard there is no other standard for good and if it's anything other than God it's not good so when he says say something good that's exactly what Micah did he said what God Said right and God's the one that's good so he said what God said he said that which was good it might not have been good to Ahab it might not have been good to zedekiah those four under prophets but what Ahab but what Micah said was absolutely good because it's what God Said Amen praise the Lord Micah said as the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto me that will I do I can imagine the reverberation around the world today is still happening from this messenger's eye roll you can imagine when Micah said I'm only going to say what God Said that messenger iroll must have been so atic you can probably still feel it today oh here we go again yeah there you go again you know why because you got a guy that's only going to say what God says you have a prophet that only going to say what God says you got a man who was murdered that wanted to honor his leg Legacy his Heritage by God by refusing to sell the The Inheritance to an ungodly man amen so you got a couple that are in there and Micah just happens to be one of them but again I can only imagine that messenger is probably thinking oh my we in for it now amen did you feel I felt his eye rolled again just then still rolling his eyes are still rolling Micah said as the Lord liveth what the Lord say to me that will I speak so he came to the king now look I I I I love this part you just got to read the Bible see this is this isn't a cartoon friend it's not fictional this it's not something that's dramatic or this is this is a story of events that actually took place from Witnesses he said and he came to the king and the King said unto him Micah shall we go up against ram of Gilead to battle battle or should we forbear and look what Micah said and he answered him go and prosper for for the Lord shall deliver into the hands of the king he said the exact same thing the other 400 said but but look what Ahab he could not have said it in the same context because look what Ahab said the king said unto him how many times shall iure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord mik's like okay you want me to tell you the truth so you can imagine what mik is probably telling him said he probably did the exact same thing that all the 400 went up he said and he answered go and prosper the Lord shall deliver into the hands of the king yeah is that what you wanted to hear if I fulfill money is that what is that what you wanted me to say is that what you were looking to hear go yeah go go do it God God will be with you you'll take it go yeah whatever and then ahab's like you know what Micah you're just playing with me right right right you've always just told me what was right in the name of the Lord he said okay you want me to tell you what's right in the name of the Lord I'll tell you amen I'll tell you he said I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills of sheep that have no Shepherd you want to know the truth that's the truth am praise God you are not going to take it you are not going to conquer it you are not going to overcome it it is not going to be yours you are going to die in battle if you go up there you are going to be a dead man because God showed me Israel like sheep on the Hills having no Shepherd you're a dead man Ahab if you go you're a dead man and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man man to his house in peace no master dead the king of Israel said unto hos did I not tell thee that he would pry no good concerning me but evil now he's calling God evil that's what God said if God is speaking evil of what you're doing then what you're doing is evil amen if God is speaking evil of what you are doing then what you are doing is evil amen amen okay and he said hear thou therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven standing around I love this is such a great story Heaven standing by him on the right hand and on his left the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ram of Gilead because see notice what is God doing he's working all these circumstances right all this has that God's even called a counsel up in heaven of all the evil of all the evil spirits to come up and try to find out which one is going to be able to convince Ahab because ahab's got to go to Ramo Gilead amen he's got to go to Ramo Gilead so what do we do and one said on this manner the other said on that manner and there came forth a spirit that stood before the Lord and said uh that stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him a spirit a spirit yes and the Lord said unto him wherewith he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so because the prophecy of Elijah from years before is about to be fulfilled and I need someone I need a lying Spirit to go down or I need a spirit need a lying Spirit came forth I will go down as a lying spirit and I will put a lie in the mouth of all those 400 prophets you say now how would you call a zedekiah a liar because the word calls him a liar amen amen not only do he know he did not hear from God but we know right here that God sent forth a li spirit in every one of Elijah's uh ahab's prophets and zedekiah was one of them he's a liar I will put a lying Spirit Thou shalt persuade go and do so now therefore behold the Lord ha put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets you imagine one lone man he's got the king of uh of of Judah josphat he's got the king of Israel Ahab he's got the seriousness of this entire Israel going up to to uh to Syria to try to go to battle to take rou Gad he's got 400 prophets sitting here that he's flying in the face of and Micah by himself amen this is how we know when Micah got so stubborn didn't realize that part but Micah stood there bull stubborn in the face of all of that in those 400 prophecies that every one of you is a liar amen that that's not easy friend that doesn't just happen just because you have a passing relationship with the Lord amen you've got to have something yes to be able to stand there and call it out to Ahab like it is the king of Israel who could put you to death with you know just with one single action say take him out son but he's calling all 400 of those prophets those men those all four of them I mean basically he's standing there looking over and said all 400 of you guys are liars you're all a bunch of liars God showed me that a Spirit came before him and that Spirit left him and went in all 400 of you to lie right now that that took God Amen people might say something like that took gumption or something to know that took God to have a man stand there like that and call all 400 of those men you're a bunch of liars but that's the truth amen had to be done amen now therefore behold the Lord put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these Prophets The Lord has spoken evil concerning them but get but zedekiah the son of chenana the chief liar went near and smoked Michael on the cheek and said which way the spirit of the Lord uh depart from me to speak unto thee Micah said behold I'll see one day you'll find out one day when thou shalt go into thy inner chamber to hide thyself you liar and the king of Israel said take Micah carry him uh back to the uh uh back unto Amon the governor of the city of joash this King's son and said uh uh thus thus sayith the king put this fellow in the prison feed him bread of Affliction water Affliction until I come in peace and look what Micah's last parting Micah said if you return at all in peace God hadn't spoke to me praise the Lord God hasn't spoke by me and said and then he turned around with his last breath and he said all you people listen so they could bear witness to what's about to happen that what God spoke through that man was the truth that was his last word oh hearken old people every one of you listen what I've told you is the truth that's thus sayith the Lord that is God speaking today you will be witness of it because your King's about to die had l a little bit amen he's about to die now what did God have to do God sent them to battle and even even Ahab tried to disguise him I'm going to condense it now a little bit go Ahab tried to tried to to uh uh disguise himself to make himself not look like the actual King oh that's so and they went through and they started chasing Jos because he had the robes the King on and he screamed out and they realized no that's not Ahab we're going after Ahab and so one looked at him and Drew bow and shot him the arrow he died right there in the Chariot amen battle raised around he died right there in the chot of course they did not at that time take ramoth Gilead they run scared and Scattered because it wasn't thus sayeth the Lord right they ran scared they got it later absolutely yeah but not then they ran scared and Scattered and Ahab died right there and they took him uh they took him off but what but look look at the specific prophecy here let me see if I can find it because I'm trying to move this along they shot him with an arrow the joints of the harness which is a miracle shot really you got it's like it's almost like David's slingshot with Goliath there's like that big of a spot in his entire body you can shoot and it would kill him the arrows shot him there he said take me out for I'm wounded 35th verse the battle increased that day the king stayed up by The Chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out in uh out of the wound into the midst of The Chariot but that's not the prophecy what was the prophecy the prophecy was the dogs will lick your blood where it licked nabos that's the prophecy there went out a proclamation about the host going down in the sun saying every man to his City exactly what Micah said right exactly what God showed Michael Amen to the sing every man to his City every man to his own country so the king died and was brought to Samaria and they buried the king in Samaria but that's not the prophecy now comes the pro the Fulfillment of Prophecy and one washed the Chariot in the pool of Samaria so they took him and they took him aside and they buried him but then a caretaker a nobody a footwash flunky took the Chariot that was full of blood to uh to the pool of Samaria and washed the Blood Out Of The Chariot and as he washed the Blood Out Of The Chariot the dogs LIF up his blood yes at the exact same spot that they stoned nebar the exact same spot that the dogs licked his blood is the exact same spot that they licked his blood he was never he wasn't even there Ahab never never even went to that part to that point but the Chariot did and along with the Chariot came his blood when they washed the blood out the dogs licked up his blood exact same spot amen you said how is that going to be and a person you say well there's a prophecy I know that that my dogs my blood's going to be licked up by dogs amen and and I know where nabbo was killed I know where the dogs s his blood you know what I'll just never go over there didn't have to he didn't have to go I'll avoid that prophecy by not going over there no no that doesn't work that way amen uh he never went over there but his blood did yes the Chariot did the blood did and they and and this nobody washed the blood out for the dogs to lick his blood fulfilling the prophecy that Elijah had given amen what was the other prophecy that the dogs would eat Jezebel yes not lick up her blood but eat her yes by the wall of jezel y That's the prophecy yes amen you know how to try to avoid that don't go to jezrael Jezebel but we already found that doesn't work if the prophecy is the prophecy and it's a true prophecy by a true word Propet it's going to come to pass no matter whether you don't go to jel or not if if at the wall in jezel the dogs are going to eat your body you don't have you just might as well take sleeping pill and just go lay down it's over done I mean you might have more time than that but I mean the bottom line is it's going to happen and there's nothing you can do about it amen I mean it would be nice if there was some repentance maybe maybe the Lord would have been I don't know but uh the prophecy came forth that was it it was going to happen now but in Second Kings I want to get this and I'm closing I had some other scripture but uh you remember you remember brother random called Elijah Jezebel's Pastor amen he did go look it up brother randam called Elijah Jezebel's pastor but in the second Kings uh the ninth chapter we want to fulfill this other scripture this other prophecy second Kings 9 let's just start with verse 30 and when juu was come to jezrael jezrael heard it this is a man of God obviously the army of Israel and Jezebel heard of of of jiu coming to jezrael and she painted her face she tired her head and looked out at the window that just made she made herself pretty she made her herself look uh young or as young as she could or um vibrant uh if you will her face uh she didn't look all tired and washed out that's what that's what it means she when she tired her head it means she made her try to make herself more alive and more vivacious looking uh uh with with the painted face and and she looked out uh out of the window and ju entered in at the gate she he said had zerai peace who slew his master and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who in other words who's on the side of the Lord yes who's on God's side amen because I'm on God's side and if you're on my side we're on God's side who's on my side who and there and they looked out to him two or three units and he said thr her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he troed under her her underfoot he just rode over her amen and when and when uh when he was com in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a King's Daughter so he commanded Ed them to throw her off the roof to her death by the wall of Jezreel amen King's Daughter in in a pronounced place and that was the most pronounced place you could be especially as royalty at the wall in the wall through all out the window at the wall of jezrael bam she's done he runs over her and he goes in after running over her body he goes in and eats has lunch pretty good P trami sandwich wash it down with a little water hey you guys go go see about that jeze she was the King's Daughter anyway least go out there and bury her they go out there and when they went to bury her 3 35th verse they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull the feet and the palms of her hands the dogs that ate her right where by the wall of jezel exactly what brother what uh brother exactly what Elijah prophesied right she became a dog's exr Jezebel it it it's hard to enunciate such a descriptive word to understand the kind of woman Jezebel was but you can understand of the character of woman she was by the fact that God allowed her to be eaten and defecated by a dog that I'll tell you all you need to know about how what kind of woman Jezebel was and there's probably a lot of uh nothing left but her skull feet and hands the palm of her hand therefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the Lord which uh which he spake by his servant Elijah the uh Elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezel shall dogs eat the Flesh of Jezebel that's exactly right the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dumb upon the face uh face of the field and the portion of jezrael uh uh so that they shall not say this is Jezebel no Remnant in other words there's not it's just going to be scattered out in the dung of the field there's not going to be a grave to say here Jezebel no there's part of her there's part of her right amen there's not going to be anything left over her that that ought to tell y'all you need to know the kind of character that woman was right people think I get away with it I can do anything I want just go heab don't worry about it we'll just make sure and get some Liars over here we'll get some false Witnesses I I'm sure none of us have ever had false Witnesses against us I'm sure nobody's ever come against any body here to say something wrong about you make others look and look at you in a different yeah know denn is shaking his head um yeah I'm sure that's never happened to anybody here see it's the same thing it's it's the same Spirit yes amen same thing happens today yeah you say oh curse that person or you can say God help that person right you have a choice yeah amen my choice is not God killed them God not and I don't think that was that was anything that would have been said Neo probably even though it cost him his life probably wouldn't said that but this was God's judgment yes this was God's judgment among upon them amen and it was his to be met out now when this when God sent the prophet to prophesy it was going to happen even if he had to bring this one over here and had to do this one over here he had to it had to come on it had to come on ahab's heart to feel like he wanted to go to Ramo Gilead he had to have je uh Jehoshaphat there he wouldn't have gone by himself he wouldn't have gone if Jehoshaphat would withheld his men and his horses he wouldn't have done it he wouldn't have gone if there hadn't been the lying mouth and the and the M the lying spirit in the mouth of all those prophets he wouldn't have gone all those things happen God manufactured all that to happen just so the prophecy of Elijah could be brought forth shot with an arrow bleeding in the Chariot buried in Samaria but did not lick the blood until the pool of Samaria which Ahab was never at but his blood was amen amen God brings his word to pass it may not be the way we think it's going to be it may not happen the way we have it conceived in our minds but God is going to bring it to pass Amen in his way in his time the right way the right person God's going to do it praise the Lorden the best thing we can do is just continue to pray trust the Lord and have faith amen faith and patience sometimes it takes time faith and patience amen sometimes it seems like three years is forever sometimes it seems like it was two days yes amen but it will happen yes it took almost 7 was it 700 years 800 years for when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive right amen before it actually happened it's been how it's been 196 since we've been uh uh I can't even add 60 years since brother BR almost 60 years since brother Bram said that California was going under right he's gone on been gone for how many years I imagine probably most if not all the people in that service that stood there and and listened to it live or gone men that we know like brother green brother McHugh brother Billy Paul they're all gone but you know what it will sink yes it don't matter if I'm still here or you're still here or not it will yes period amen amen there's nothing anybody can do about it yes they could try to bring the most stable cords they can and fly helicopters or airplanes all whatever hover all day long and try to hang that thing it won't happen right it's going to break off it's goty you know what becomes more real to me too because every time I fly over that salt and sea I think about it and we fly right coming back from Riverside California area we fly right over the salt and sea I took pictures of it I remember what brother ramam said about it right amen Plum back to the salt and sea it'll break off all that just comes flooding back to understand it's going to happen yes amen we might have things things you pray for things you ask God for it may not come exactly like you think it's going to but it will come it will happen God will bring to pass he will he gives us the things that we have need of Amen we just have faith patience believe it God will continue to do it amen a true word prophit his words will happen it will come to pass yes amen we know it we've seen so much of it happen so far people can be critical of it they can write I hear this uh I hear this news I'm sorry to keep you but I hear this new new story that's coming out supposed to be like a Tarter now I don't know if you've all heard about it's a 10 a Tarter thing is sounds like it's mostly against the message and uh how stuff has happened in the message and stuff that pastors knew about or or brother brandom or something or uh that people in the 1960s oh imagine this somebody in the 1960s whipped somebody with a belt did you did y'all know that happened it's just it's it's just it's foolishness Saints it's ridiculous you could go down pretty much any house in America any middle uh middle americ neighborhood and the child's being whipped with a Bel not abused but uh but corrected should be probably there was some abuse but they're still Abus anyway they don't use it the other it's probably more mental abuse now today than it was yeah I thought what kind of a revelation is that a man spanked a kid with his belt in 1960 anyway it it seems like these kind of people they get such a hatred but there's this there's a spirit there you know and God's in control of all this so amen whatever's coming Lord let it come if it's our time let us we're ready to go I I'm I'm I feel we had a little more grace maybe with this colonel election and uh and all but anyway that may just be the may turn out to be just the opposite right uh but either way God's in control of it yes right uh I I like the way michah said it michah said I vote who I vote I know who I'm voting for I know who I want he said but ultimately God's in charge whoever God says is going to happen amen and that's the truth and that's what matters doesn't mean we don't engage doesn't mean we don't do something me it's like saying well you know I I'm a born again Christian I know I'm going to heaven so what's the point in going to church that's right I mean you all are believers I don't need to preach to you anymore I just go home amen but no we still get engaged we still plant our potatoes we still as I did I voted we still we still plant our potatoes amen but this guy he's like a lot of the others they all they he he's he's dubbed it the message if you've not seen it he's dubbed it the message we call it the message we use we we use words is if you go to any message Church you'll hear words used like the bride yes oh the end times oh my the Seven Seals this is horrible stuff there should be such an outcry we use the word the term the bride in any message church but then you see how notices where he goes over and finds I know there's things that's happened I know there's churches even in this town has done things that's actually okay things that have been done wrong uh but it's just it's like me saying okay well that's you know every message believer is like this okay well then every reporter is a ball liar how about that right every every every reporter is a is a low down crook I just take and put all of you are there some Crooks yeah are there some Liars yeah that doesn't mean all of them are right amen we just need to be who we are as Christians yes amen be Believers live the life we know to live yes amen and live it the way we're supposed to yes and we do it as an example before the Lord and for everybody else they witness these people I've heard have been told that already gone and uh interviewed Tim puit and uh been the voice of God and stuff so it's all right amen nothing to worry about God's got it under control interesting as brother Dennis said the times that we're living but amen we are here Saints we know it amen let's stand God's got it all under control yes he do and we trust trust him with it yes with every bit of it amen I just want to do this amen this we sang this many times sanctuary and we sing that again amen
