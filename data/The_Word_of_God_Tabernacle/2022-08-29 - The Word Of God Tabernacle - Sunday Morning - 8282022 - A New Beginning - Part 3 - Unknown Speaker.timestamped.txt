[24:12] in your name

[25:03] talked to abraham he saw lazarus resting
[25:07] in the bosom of abraham he said send
[25:11] someone to warn my brothers my family

[37:31] to be in the house of god

[37:37] people back 50 years ago was asking
[37:39] brother branham should we still go to
[37:40] church are you still advocating church
[37:42] he said absolutely if there's anything
[37:45] you do make sure you get to church and
[37:47] lord i think that kind of uh pinpoints

[37:53] on our hearts this morning to be in the
[37:54] house of god

[38:53] this service today will be accomplished

[39:09] and
[39:10] uh for your glory and honor and to

[39:17] commit it to you let ourselves loose
[39:20] that you would have preeminence now we
[39:22] committed and ask it in the name of the
[39:24] lord jesus christ we pray amen amen
[39:27] praise the lord
[39:29] genesis chapter 1
[39:31] read the first couple of verses again in
[39:33] the beginning
[39:34] god created the heaven and the earth
[39:37] and the earth was without form and void
[39:39] and darkness is upon the face of the
[39:41] deep the spirit of god moved upon the
[39:44] face of the waters you can be seated if
[39:46] you'd like
[39:52] praise the lord now we're going to
[39:53] continue all of the thought we left off
[39:55] with last week the new beginning this
[39:57] will be part three
[39:58] uh that we uh that we began a couple of
[40:01] weeks ago
[40:02] and uh
[40:04] excuse me reiterate a few things that we
[40:06] had left off from last week and try to
[40:08] get back into sort of where we left off
[40:11] but
[40:12] before we get to that point there's some
[40:14] things that i want to get into first of
[40:16] all from the book of genesis again
[40:19] we're actually going to try to start in
[40:21] genesis and
[40:23] go over to revelation and end up in
[40:25] genesis so
[40:26] uh we're just trying to encompass the
[40:28] the the seed chapter and the finishing
[40:30] chapter uh of the bible the the books
[40:33] genesis through revelation uh but let's
[40:35] turn over now staying in genesis now the
[40:38] the eighth chapter genesis chapter eight
[40:43] and like i said i want to highlight a
[40:45] few things here before we move on to
[40:48] trying to get to because i told you last
[40:50] week
[40:50] there was some scripture and things that
[40:52] sort that really tied it together that i
[40:54] wanted to do it just would have been too
[40:57] lengthy for one service uh so i kind of
[41:00] split that up and bring us back to that
[41:02] point but i want to lay this foundation
[41:04] first because last week
[41:06] uh as we began the first week trying to
[41:09] lay out and paralyze a parallel the uh
[41:12] the understandings of the new beginning
[41:15] and the andaluvian beginning
[41:17] or end and then the bc beginning and bc
[41:20] into a.d and on into the day that we
[41:22] live today and what we're on the cusp of
[41:25] right now that's about to take place
[41:27] with this bride going home and what's
[41:29] left and what happens
[41:31] so the whole point of the new beginning
[41:34] remember we the the whole premise of
[41:37] this uh title and thought here is
[41:40] getting us into that new city revelation
[41:42] 21. so at the end of all of this we'll
[41:46] we'll get into that last part of it but
[41:48] uh trying to draw those parallels and
[41:51] those understandings through the
[41:52] scripture uh we ended up with noah and
[41:55] the ark and uh methuselah and and
[41:58] and enoch naming methuselah what he did
[42:01] the enoch would understand when there's
[42:02] the issue of waters it'd be time to get
[42:04] on the ark
[42:06] and of course
[42:07] enoch's dad
[42:09] living
[42:10] 777 years and trying to
[42:14] to see everything the types and shadows
[42:16] of the old testament teach us about
[42:18] what's going on now
[42:20] what we know in the new testament what
[42:22] we've seen through the church ages and
[42:23] what's god and what god is doing for us
[42:26] right now amen it's nice all to know and
[42:29] we can preach everything but we got to
[42:31] make sure to understand and apply it for
[42:32] what who we are now
[42:34] what we are in our lives and where we
[42:37] are in our lives and in in life period
[42:40] uh and as time continues to unfold
[42:43] genesis chapter eight uh we're going to
[42:45] read a few verses of scripture here then
[42:47] we're going to
[42:48] then go over to verse 9.
[42:52] start with the 15th verse genesis
[42:54] chapter 8
[42:55] verse 15 here
[42:58] now this is after the flood
[43:00] and we've gone through the andalusian
[43:03] world
[43:04] into the flood and now we're going to
[43:06] talk about after the flood amen after
[43:09] the flood and then we're going to finish
[43:11] it off with the other thought from the
[43:13] last week so chapter uh chapter 8 verse
[43:16] 15. and god spake unto noah saying
[43:19] go forth
[43:20] of the ark out of the ark
[43:23] uh thou and thy wife and thy sons and
[43:26] thy sons wives with thee
[43:28] bring forth with thee every living thing
[43:30] that is with thee of all flesh both the
[43:33] fowl of cattle and of every creeping
[43:35] thing that creepeth upon the earth that
[43:37] they may breed abundantly in the earth
[43:39] and be fruitful and multiply upon the
[43:42] earth
[43:43] and noah went forth that his sons and
[43:45] his wife and his son's wives with him
[43:48] every beast every creeping thing and
[43:50] every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon
[43:53] the earth after their kinds went forth
[43:55] out of the ark
[43:57] so again we're on the other side of the
[43:59] other side of the flood now
[44:01] and noah building an altar
[44:03] unto the lord and took of every clean
[44:06] beast and of every clean fowl and
[44:08] offered burnt offerings on the altar
[44:11] the lord smelled a sweet savior and the
[44:14] lord said in his heart i will not again
[44:16] curse the ground any more for man's sake
[44:19] for the imagination of man's heart is
[44:22] evil from his youth
[44:24] neither will i again smite anymore every
[44:27] living thing as i have done
[44:29] while the earth remains seedtime and
[44:31] harvest and cold and heat and summer and
[44:34] winter and day and night shall not cease
[44:36] now let's jump over to the 11th verse of
[44:39] the 9th chapter
[44:41] 11th verse of the 9th chapter
[44:46] and i will establish my covenant with
[44:47] you
[44:49] neither shall all flesh be cut off any
[44:51] more by the waters of a flood neither
[44:53] shall there be any uh
[44:56] there any more be a flood to destroy the
[44:58] earth and god said this is the token of
[45:01] the covenant which i have between me and
[45:03] you and every living creature that is
[45:06] with you for perpetual generations
[45:09] i do set my bow in the cloud and it
[45:12] shall be for a token of a covenant
[45:15] between me and the earth and it shall
[45:17] come to pass when i bring a cloud over
[45:20] the earth that the bow shall be seen in
[45:23] the cloud
[45:24] and i will remember my covenant which i
[45:26] which is between me and you and every
[45:28] living creature of all flesh and the
[45:31] water shall no more become a flood to
[45:34] destroy all flesh
[45:36] now god give
[45:38] the promise here now this is after the
[45:40] flood and i i want to get into that
[45:43] promise in the second half of this today
[45:46] but that promise that god gave an
[45:48] understanding after the flood
[45:50] after the destruction
[45:52] god gave a promise amen now we know in
[45:56] the transition time between the between
[45:58] the bc and a.d god also gave a promise
[46:02] amen he sent his only begotten son that
[46:05] was a promise that god had given that he
[46:07] was going to do
[46:08] and that promise god fulfilled now god's
[46:11] given us a promise in this last day each
[46:14] one has had its own promise now none of
[46:17] those promises have ever gone away when
[46:20] god gave that promise here in genesis
[46:22] chapter 9 you can go outside and look at
[46:25] the sky when it rains or clouds and you
[46:28] can see the same promise that sets there
[46:30] today
[46:31] you can have the same promise that they
[46:34] had uh
[46:35] when we began the new testament with
[46:37] jesus christ that didn't end there that
[46:40] promise is still the same today as it
[46:42] was 2 000 years ago so as god continues
[46:46] as he sets forth his promises he doesn't
[46:49] promise and then take away he promises
[46:52] through perpetual generations that we
[46:55] can enjoy and and realize the the grace
[46:58] of god in our lives for the promises
[47:01] that he gave us he gave them
[47:03] in the andalusian world the rainbow
[47:05] he gave them at that time the transition
[47:08] between old testament new testament his
[47:10] only begotten son jesus christ that
[47:14] obviously promise still resides today
[47:16] with us one natural one spiritual and
[47:19] now we know that we've got a promise
[47:21] that's coming ahead of us
[47:22] we're at the end of this time
[47:24] or that promise that god's fulfilling to
[47:26] this bride that we're experiencing and
[47:30] we'll reach the
[47:32] the the pinnacle of that experience when
[47:34] we have our body changes we go into
[47:36] rapture amen the promises that god gave
[47:39] each one has its promise as each new
[47:42] beginning takes place god promises
[47:45] something now there's a transition of
[47:48] each time and there'll be a transition
[47:50] for this time but as we know
[47:53] god first destroyed it with water then
[47:56] he dropped his blood on it and reclaimed
[47:59] it and now he's going to destroy it with
[48:01] fire where the elements of the even the
[48:03] atmospheres explode to where again that
[48:06] new city the holy jerusalem can come and
[48:09] set up that that god has set forth now
[48:12] as we're entering in after the flood i
[48:14] just wanted to draw those comparisons
[48:16] and we'll come back to that but uh but i
[48:19] want to get back into now the after the
[48:21] flood part so let's go to leviticus uh
[48:24] chapter 23
[48:26] and i want to talk about this part
[48:28] before we finish up with the other
[48:29] genesis excuse me leviticus chapter 23.
[48:36] now leviticus
[48:38] chapter 23 i think i said the other day
[48:40] 26.
[48:42] that was my mistake if i have to have
[48:43] said that i forgot uh when i was
[48:46] referencing that i think in part one i
[48:48] may have said leviticus 26 it's
[48:50] leviticus 23 are the feast days
[48:53] leviticus 23 are the feast days that god
[48:56] gave to the jews the promises that god
[48:59] gave the first feast was the feast of
[49:01] the passover second feast was the feast
[49:04] of unleavened bread third feast was the
[49:06] first fruits fourth feast was the wave
[49:08] sheath the wave offering the loaf
[49:11] that god the first to come to maturity
[49:13] the fifth was the feast of the trumpets
[49:16] the sixth was this feast of atonement
[49:18] that god making atonement with his
[49:20] children and we'll probably get to that
[49:23] um
[49:24] if the lord allows
[49:25] in this study as we go through it
[49:28] because that's a very important one as
[49:30] we end up as we end up at this time in
[49:32] humanity uh the feast of atonement for
[49:35] the jews but the seventh now that's what
[49:37] we're going to talk about in the 33rd
[49:39] verse
[49:40] the seventh
[49:41] the completion as we know seven is
[49:44] completion we talked about that last
[49:46] week the uh laymak
[49:49] noah's dad
[49:50] had uh had a perfect completion with his
[49:54] name 777.
[49:56] so just a few years before the flood
[49:58] gets so we know seven is completion that
[50:01] seven is the tabernacle so hold in mind
[50:03] now
[50:04] uh that we know the three is perfection
[50:06] five is grace seven is completion so on
[50:08] and so forth as seven is completion it
[50:11] winds those things up now we know that
[50:14] the winding up of this through these
[50:16] seven church ages which are a type of
[50:19] the seven churches of asia that was that
[50:22] was in the scripture those seven church
[50:24] ages you know a lot of people uh
[50:26] christians don't even believe in
[50:28] dispensationalism
[50:29] uh they believe that those seven
[50:31] churches that god was talking to or
[50:33] jesus there in revelations two and three
[50:35] was just to those churches there they
[50:37] don't believe in dismissalism where
[50:40] actually each each church represented an
[50:43] age that we've lived through since the
[50:45] crucifixion of christ
[50:47] they don't believe that
[50:50] of course that's how we know brother
[50:52] branham taught it and and we see it
[50:54] through the scripture
[50:55] as it identifies and recognized that in
[50:57] the scripture it wasn't just those
[50:58] churches that he's talking to each one
[51:00] of us as you look at the descriptions
[51:03] that jesus gave of each one of those
[51:05] churches it doesn't completely match
[51:07] that church but it does match each
[51:09] church age
[51:10] that's why
[51:11] the seals had to be broken that's where
[51:14] that's why the seals had to be open and
[51:16] expose that so we at this last day can
[51:19] receive and understand that revelation
[51:21] that god gives us the tactics of the
[51:23] enemy back from that time till today how
[51:26] that
[51:27] white horse rider red horse rider and
[51:29] black horse writer and then pale horse
[51:31] rider ran through those church ages and
[51:33] identify that to see him today the pale
[51:36] horse riding today you know a pale horse
[51:39] i don't mean to get into the seals here
[51:40] but you know that pale horse is just a
[51:42] bunch of mixed up colors
[51:45] that's exactly what we have today yeah i
[51:47] look and sometimes you go out the world
[51:49] and
[51:50] two places i've noticed you you can
[51:52] really see the spirit of the world today
[51:54] and that's in airports and malls
[51:56] i try to avoid the mall as best i can
[51:58] but i can't avoid the airports anymore
[52:00] but you see them
[52:02] i i look at one person goes by and say
[52:04] wow they look like they're from the 20s
[52:06] their haircut or their dress or whatever
[52:08] i get another one they look like they're
[52:10] the 40s
[52:11] oh they look like they're from i mean
[52:13] there's just all kinds the hairstyles
[52:15] and and the dress and all the things the
[52:18] way they look and you think my goodness
[52:19] there's just there's no identification
[52:22] to this age
[52:23] there really isn't because it's like all
[52:25] mixed up from all these other ages used
[52:27] to be when i went to school all kids
[52:29] mostly look alike nowadays you look at
[52:31] them and some of them has uh got this
[52:33] haircut or that because someone's hair
[52:35] is way down to here and some of it's
[52:36] just buzzed off some of it's nothing at
[52:38] all it's just it's just all mixed up
[52:40] there's nothing there's no
[52:41] identification to it it's cause the pale
[52:43] horse is riding today as the pale horse
[52:46] goes forth and all these spirits all
[52:48] mixed up and the devil trying to just
[52:50] destroy it every chance he gets because
[52:52] he knows his time is running short as
[52:54] the devil knows his time's running short
[52:57] he fights that much harder
[52:59] he fights that much stronger because he
[53:01] realizes his time is coming to an end
[53:04] and as he knows his time's coming into
[53:06] an end it just gets that much stronger
[53:08] so this step hill horse riding as it
[53:11] continues to write but it's an
[53:12] identification of the spirits that's
[53:14] going on in the world today
[53:16] uh that spirit as that as it identifies
[53:20] itself we can see it moving among the
[53:22] people you see it out in the world and
[53:25] that just that just is a part of the
[53:27] identification that god gives us but now
[53:30] as it goes through these seven feasts we
[53:32] know we're at we're at that end time
[53:35] we're at that point where time is going
[53:38] to run out or where this bride goes and
[53:40] uh
[53:41] and then there's a millennium time and
[53:43] we know that millennium time is a type
[53:45] of the seventh but now let's look
[53:47] because remember the millennium is a
[53:49] period of time right
[53:51] so let's go and look at this this is the
[53:53] seventh uh 33rd verse the seventh the
[53:56] feast of tabernacles
[53:58] the feast of tabernacles the tabernacle
[53:59] what is the tabernacle it's a place
[54:01] where people gather together
[54:04] it's a place where you have sacred holy
[54:06] assemblies together a tabernacle is a
[54:09] place of people who come together who
[54:11] who
[54:12] have a common thought a common thread a
[54:14] common belief in in in god or the lord
[54:17] jesus or whatever the tabernacle is a
[54:19] place where we all gather and come
[54:21] together like an assembly like we've got
[54:23] here this morning this sacred assembly
[54:25] that we've come us together
[54:28] feast of tabernacles now and the lord
[54:29] said unto moses saying
[54:32] speak unto the children of israel saying
[54:34] the 15th day of the seventh month
[54:37] shall be the feast of tabernacles for
[54:40] seven days unto the lord now you've got
[54:42] the seventh
[54:44] feast
[54:45] for seven days
[54:48] unto the lord on the first day shall be
[54:50] a holy convocation ye shall do no
[54:52] several work therein
[54:54] seven days ye shall offer an offering
[54:57] made by fire unto the lord seven days
[55:01] okay so each one of those a
[55:02] representation of the seven church ages
[55:05] going even up into the seventh church
[55:08] age or or uh the uh
[55:10] uh
[55:11] into the millennium
[55:13] if you will now
[55:15] seven church ages uh
[55:17] seven days you shall offer an offer made
[55:19] by firing to the lord on the eighth day
[55:22] shall be in holy convocation unto you
[55:25] and ye shall offer an offering made by
[55:28] fire unto the lord it is a solemn
[55:31] assembly and ye shall do no several work
[55:34] therein now notice that god has
[55:37] placed he's in a position to where he
[55:39] says there'll be no several work done
[55:42] therein no work done therein now as this
[55:48] seventh feast
[55:51] reaches a place of completion
[55:54] and those seven days of that feast reach
[55:57] its place of completion
[55:59] for the first time god speaks about an
[56:03] eighth day
[56:05] now you can't make an eighth day
[56:07] scripturally because you mess up the
[56:09] pneumatics of the bible
[56:12] you you've lost out of your threes five
[56:14] sevens tens 12
[56:15] you've gone past that see
[56:18] so what is the eighth day of
[56:20] representation of
[56:22] an eighth day is simply a rolling over
[56:26] into the first day or rolling over into
[56:30] the next event
[56:32] which in this case would roll over from
[56:35] the millennium into an eternity
[56:40] this eighth day is the beginning of an
[56:42] eternity you had a seventh day where
[56:45] there's no work done therein but there's
[56:47] an eighth day that god speaks up to the
[56:50] children of israel that is going to be a
[56:53] type of course of us of a beginning into
[56:56] an eternity at that point there will be
[56:59] no days feasts
[57:02] naturally
[57:04] naturally now the bride those who've
[57:06] been born again us
[57:08] we've already escaped those things
[57:11] those things don't mean anything to us
[57:13] you know through the bible especially
[57:15] paul tells now if you want to
[57:18] uphold the law if you want to
[57:22] try to live the law
[57:23] of course without christ in your life if
[57:26] you want to try to do that you live by
[57:27] the law you die by the law then the law
[57:29] applies to you
[57:31] but when you're born again and the
[57:32] spirit of god has come into your life
[57:34] then then
[57:36] that law doesn't cease to exist but
[57:39] you've transitioned or trans opposed
[57:42] past that law because you've now entered
[57:45] into christ
[57:47] and christ the word is perfect
[57:50] that's why the only thing about you a
[57:53] born-again christian
[57:56] that makes a mistake or sins as we'll
[57:58] call it is your flesh
[58:00] or your spirit even but your soul
[58:02] belongs to god yeah you can no more sin
[58:05] we've talked about that several times
[58:08] you can no more sin who you the real you
[58:11] there is no more sin the because in your
[58:14] soul you've been born again of the
[58:16] spirit of god
[58:17] so as that has taken place in you
[58:20] spiritually as you were born again
[58:23] rolled you over into that place of
[58:25] eternity
[58:27] your soul has been bought paid for and
[58:30] sealed until its destination
[58:33] amen
[58:35] it's as eternal as god is why because it
[58:37] is god
[58:38] it is the life of god in you
[58:42] we say that so many times but i don't
[58:44] think sometimes we apply it properly to
[58:47] understand the full ramifications of
[58:50] what that means to us
[58:52] and what that means to us is you have
[58:54] already entered into that place
[58:57] you have already gotten if you're born
[58:59] again in the spirit of god and your soul
[59:01] has now been purchased by god and god
[59:04] lives in you
[59:06] and has become the permanent prominent
[59:08] resident of your soul and can no longer
[59:10] be open is sealed until this destination
[59:14] you are just as good there as you
[59:17] is the time you will be there physically
[59:20] already there because you've rolled over
[59:23] and entered into that time that's the
[59:24] spiritual application of this practical
[59:28] uh physical carnal uh feast that god was
[59:31] giving the jews
[59:33] they did it as a practice as a human
[59:35] exercise we do it as a faith
[59:39] we do it as belief
[59:41] we do it as a born-again experience that
[59:44] is give us that place of
[59:48] not only the seventh day rest but in
[59:50] entering into eternity
[59:52] we gotta understand look see friends if
[59:55] you're born again in the spirit of god
[59:56] it's already there amen
[59:59] because that was an attribute of god
[1:00:02] remember i told you about the uh
[1:00:04] intellectual property
[1:00:07] that we have on the earth today when
[1:00:09] somebody has a thought puts it down on
[1:00:10] paper and certifies it was their
[1:00:12] original thought that becomes their
[1:00:14] intelligent property intellectual
[1:00:16] property nobody can take that from you
[1:00:19] nobody can take your intellectual
[1:00:21] property and use it for themselves
[1:00:23] without giving you credit
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:26] legally now this may sound wrong and i
[1:00:29] don't want it to sound wrong
[1:00:30] but legally
[1:00:32] a person can't take an original thought
[1:00:35] that i had in when i wrote my book i
[1:00:38] wrote that book
[1:00:39] when i wrote the book
[1:00:41] if it was an original thought god gave
[1:00:43] me that i put in that book nobody
[1:00:46] no minister should say that or preach
[1:00:49] that behind a pulpit without giving me
[1:00:51] credit for it
[1:00:52] now that sounds terrible sounds kind of
[1:00:55] puffed up i don't mean it that way i'm
[1:00:57] just giving you an example honestly i
[1:00:59] don't care
[1:01:00] i i it doesn't bother me anybody can
[1:01:03] take it and read it and preach it
[1:01:04] whatever they want that's fine that's
[1:01:05] the whole point of it it's god's anyway
[1:01:07] but you understand legally legally in
[1:01:10] the earth uh by the by the law if if
[1:01:13] that was original thought of now if i
[1:01:15] put something in there like i have uh
[1:01:17] einstein or other thoughts and i put
[1:01:19] credit so so and so on and and put those
[1:01:22] credits in there you look and see a book
[1:01:23] and you have credits because somebody
[1:01:25] said this before me i'm not claiming
[1:01:27] this is my own thought that's your
[1:01:28] intellectual property
[1:01:30] that intellectual property is god's
[1:01:33] thought
[1:01:34] that
[1:01:35] placed in you
[1:01:37] becomes that eternity who he saw you in
[1:01:40] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:01:41] world
[1:01:43] you are god's intellectual property
[1:01:46] because he thought of you before the
[1:01:48] foundational world
[1:01:49] that german seed that was in him that
[1:01:52] became you
[1:01:53] is now who you are it's your soul
[1:01:56] not not your body flesh but your soul
[1:01:59] the real you that's sealed until its
[1:02:01] eternal destination now this is the
[1:02:02] practical application to what god is
[1:02:05] telling us through that rolling over of
[1:02:07] eternity that eighth day
[1:02:10] puts us into eternity
[1:02:13] now i want you to know something now i
[1:02:14] found this uh out
[1:02:17] years ago
[1:02:19] i can't remember how i come across it
[1:02:22] but i found it in one of my notes
[1:02:25] but do you know that
[1:02:26] the land that the ark landed on we all
[1:02:29] know the ark mount ararat you know the
[1:02:32] land turkey and all that's around
[1:02:34] that that uh that place of the or of the
[1:02:37] resting of the ark that old land and
[1:02:40] turkey around there is known as the land
[1:02:43] of eight
[1:02:45] that's what the land turkey and the land
[1:02:47] around mount ararat where the ark landed
[1:02:50] is known as the land of eight
[1:02:54] new beginning
[1:02:56] that's what god told noah
[1:02:58] go forth this is your new beginning go
[1:03:00] forth
[1:03:01] you and the animals you and your wife
[1:03:03] your sons and their wives and go uh uh
[1:03:06] be fruitful and multiply
[1:03:08] new beginning
[1:03:10] the land of eight well god's telling us
[1:03:13] here god gave that promise to to the
[1:03:15] jews
[1:03:16] on the eighth day well there is no
[1:03:18] eighth day that's a rolling over of the
[1:03:20] week as a rolling over into another
[1:03:22] beginning
[1:03:24] a new beginning an eternity as we see it
[1:03:27] to us as an eternity spiritually for us
[1:03:30] it ends up in god
[1:03:33] bringing us into that place of eternity
[1:03:35] and frankly again that's where we live
[1:03:39] that's who we are
[1:03:41] who we really are soul
[1:03:43] not your body not your spirit your soul
[1:03:45] it's who you really are now look at this
[1:03:47] future home
[1:03:49] 1964.
[1:03:53] i think i mentioned the other day
[1:03:55] you wanted to try to listen to this it's
[1:03:57] very lengthy uh maybe over a week or
[1:04:00] something or whatever your schedule
[1:04:02] allows to be able to listen to this i'm
[1:04:04] not going to ask you if you listen to it
[1:04:05] or not but it is a powerful message
[1:04:08] future home of the it's actually a
[1:04:09] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:04:11] and the earthly bride that's the whole
[1:04:12] title
[1:04:14] notice now he says notice seven days
[1:04:17] only has to do with the old creation
[1:04:20] world time
[1:04:21] seven days
[1:04:23] notice he's talking in the spiritual
[1:04:26] seven days that's the millennium the
[1:04:28] rest day seventh day
[1:04:29] the seventh day that's the millennium
[1:04:31] the rest day as god labored six days
[1:04:34] rested on the seventh well
[1:04:36] you said well you see the eternal being
[1:04:38] he's the almighty all-powerful
[1:04:40] i looked up the rest and basically what
[1:04:42] it means is he just quit working he just
[1:04:44] ceased from his creation
[1:04:46] uh sometimes i look at words like that
[1:04:49] and i and
[1:04:50] uh
[1:04:51] you know like god repented
[1:04:54] it it's almost like god changed his mind
[1:04:56] uh when you look in the bible says god
[1:04:58] repented with us
[1:04:59] and our
[1:05:00] our definition of repent it doesn't mean
[1:05:02] the same thing
[1:05:03] when it says god rested it means that he
[1:05:06] just ceased from his labor it just means
[1:05:08] he ceased from his creation he no longer
[1:05:11] created so we call that rest i guess
[1:05:13] when you
[1:05:14] stop working and you're sitting i guess
[1:05:17] that means you're resting so
[1:05:19] but god labored six days created six
[1:05:22] days rested the seventh church labor six
[1:05:25] days rest the seventh of the bride
[1:05:28] through the church ages into this last
[1:05:30] now
[1:05:31] uh rolling over into the millennium
[1:05:34] she rests she has that rest day
[1:05:36] and again
[1:05:38] that
[1:05:39] is going to be the last half of the
[1:05:41] sermon today
[1:05:42] amen that's going to be the last half of
[1:05:44] the sermon against the reason that the
[1:05:45] lord put all as well on my heart to sing
[1:05:47] rest little bride rest amen amen that
[1:05:50] millennium is that rest well look if we
[1:05:55] if we have
[1:05:58] in your sp in your in your soul
[1:06:01] uh the part of the significant part of
[1:06:04] who you are that third innermost being
[1:06:06] if that
[1:06:07] if that is the real you
[1:06:09] then and that's where we draw our faith
[1:06:11] from
[1:06:13] that's where we draw our our strength
[1:06:15] from really god that i mean i have my
[1:06:18] human strength their spiritual mental
[1:06:20] strength but my real strength comes from
[1:06:23] god
[1:06:24] that's the soul that's the inside person
[1:06:26] so that's where my faith just draws from
[1:06:28] i don't have faith in this body this
[1:06:30] spirit i don't have faith in
[1:06:32] none of my faith is any you know that my
[1:06:34] faith is in god
[1:06:35] well if that faith is in god it's in
[1:06:37] that god that lives in me
[1:06:39] that lives in you see that's where our
[1:06:41] faith draws from so if your faith is
[1:06:44] drawing from that then that's where you
[1:06:46] also get your peace
[1:06:48] because you know that god honors his
[1:06:51] word yes you know that god is going to
[1:06:53] take care of you you know that god is
[1:06:55] going to make everything work together
[1:06:57] for your good because you love him you
[1:07:00] know that that puts you in a perpetual
[1:07:02] state of peace well if you're in a
[1:07:05] perpetual state of peace things you can
[1:07:07] rest on that yes yes you can just rest
[1:07:10] there's no reason to worry there's no
[1:07:12] reason to fret there's no reason to get
[1:07:14] upset all tore up over things and the
[1:07:16] events and stuff that happens you're at
[1:07:18] rest yes you just believe at that rest
[1:07:21] that god has entered you into that rest
[1:07:23] now that is the soul because if you've
[1:07:26] entered into that place of eternity then
[1:07:28] how can you not understand or believe
[1:07:31] that that rest is uh that is inherent in
[1:07:33] it it comes with it
[1:07:36] it's a part of it that peace that rest
[1:07:38] that's in there
[1:07:40] is it's there now we don't have to go
[1:07:42] over there to have rest now for this
[1:07:44] body that's different
[1:07:46] uh this body will will continue to labor
[1:07:49] but in that soul of man that that rest
[1:07:51] is already there
[1:07:53] because it's already in that eighth day
[1:07:56] it's already entered into that
[1:07:58] eternities
[1:08:00] praise the lord
[1:08:01] that's what and that's what we draw from
[1:08:04] as christians that's what we draw from
[1:08:06] is that soul
[1:08:07] that's what we live by that soul
[1:08:09] permeates to that spirit that spirit to
[1:08:12] the flesh and it tries to bring this
[1:08:14] flesh under subjection to what the soul
[1:08:16] is
[1:08:17] that life that's in there praise the
[1:08:19] lord so that's where we live
[1:08:22] that's where we live
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:24] god labored in the sixth day
[1:08:26] rest of seven this the church the bride
[1:08:29] labors six days and he's talking about
[1:08:31] bride general
[1:08:32] not just the individuals rest the
[1:08:34] seventh day but you're still in a time
[1:08:36] element i ain't speaking of eternal but
[1:08:39] if you see there's no such thing as
[1:08:41] eight days you go back it's no such
[1:08:43] thing as an eighth day you go back to
[1:08:45] the first day again or the starting over
[1:08:48] or the entering into eternity
[1:08:51] and time will cease
[1:08:53] amen after the millennium and the and
[1:08:55] the and the gog and magog and the white
[1:08:57] throne judgment and the evil are cast
[1:09:00] out
[1:09:01] there is no more time at that point when
[1:09:04] we get to that new beginning that this
[1:09:06] whole
[1:09:08] this whole uh series is about that new
[1:09:11] place that new jerusalem there is no
[1:09:13] time
[1:09:14] there's no time there you know we talk
[1:09:16] about well uh getting together under an
[1:09:19] oak tree for ten thousand years and just
[1:09:20] talk it over and it won't be like you
[1:09:22] began
[1:09:23] because there is no beginning
[1:09:25] there is no end
[1:09:26] that's what eternity is eternity had no
[1:09:29] beginning and it has no end it just
[1:09:31] continues on now i know i don't know
[1:09:33] about you my little
[1:09:35] finite p brain just can't comprehend
[1:09:37] that
[1:09:38] i was a kid i think i told you all this
[1:09:40] before when i was a little kid i asked
[1:09:42] my dad where did god come from well god
[1:09:44] just always has been well see i can't
[1:09:46] comprehend that but worry he had to
[1:09:48] start somewhere no he didn't
[1:09:51] the bible says he came from chemo so
[1:09:53] that was my dad's answer what is that i
[1:09:55] don't know i've yet to figure that out
[1:09:57] i've studied it a little bit but it
[1:09:59] gives me a headache so
[1:10:00] i just when i reached those places
[1:10:03] saints you just gotta put it aside and
[1:10:05] say you know i'm just
[1:10:07] it makes me understand
[1:10:09] why the last phrase of the last verse of
[1:10:12] the uh the love of god was written on
[1:10:14] the wall of an insane asylum
[1:10:16] because when you really start delving
[1:10:18] and understanding what the love of god
[1:10:20] really is it will drive you insane if
[1:10:23] you try to if you try to figure it out
[1:10:24] naturally it will drive you crazy just
[1:10:27] to try to figure that out but we but if
[1:10:30] we
[1:10:31] can just grasp it to just believe it
[1:10:34] and it doesn't have to be figured out
[1:10:37] that's where we that's where we are
[1:10:39] that's where we entered when when we
[1:10:41] talk about that city there is no time in
[1:10:43] that city
[1:10:44] no time
[1:10:46] time has ceased amen
[1:10:48] the sabbath speaks of the old law
[1:10:51] uh which was to pass away or remember
[1:10:55] the keeping of which passed away and
[1:10:57] remember what we said last week about
[1:10:58] what the scripture says when it
[1:11:00] has that phrase a couple of places like
[1:11:03] in my heavens and earth will pass away
[1:11:05] but my word mom
[1:11:06] or when peter talks about it when he
[1:11:08] says uh the the heavens and the earth
[1:11:11] will pass away it's the meaning that
[1:11:13] will go from one form to another it's
[1:11:16] not annihilated
[1:11:17] when the law
[1:11:20] came forth
[1:11:21] it was
[1:11:23] a
[1:11:24] penalty it was it was it was
[1:11:28] a a restriction that was set forth
[1:11:32] that had penalties if you broke it
[1:11:34] that's what a law is
[1:11:36] a law is something set forth that people
[1:11:38] say okay
[1:11:39] uh
[1:11:41] it's only safe to go on oracle right
[1:11:43] here up to 45. over 45 it becomes unsafe
[1:11:47] so we're going to put 45 as the speed
[1:11:49] limit out there if you break that speed
[1:11:51] limit the person who is in charge of
[1:11:53] enforcing it can give you a ticket
[1:11:56] for doing that a penalty see that's what
[1:11:59] a law is
[1:12:00] but when god
[1:12:02] uh when when that law came forth
[1:12:06] through jesus christ
[1:12:10] so many people
[1:12:11] especially people who just really
[1:12:13] basically want to live however they want
[1:12:14] to anyway just kind of say well the word
[1:12:17] the law was done away with no it wasn't
[1:12:20] the law was not done away with
[1:12:22] it was in fact in a lot of places it
[1:12:25] magnified itself amen as we know jesus
[1:12:28] magnified it many times
[1:12:30] uh
[1:12:32] thou shalt not kill thy brother
[1:12:34] that's the law but jesus came forth and
[1:12:36] said if you hate your brother in your
[1:12:38] heart without a cause you've killed him
[1:12:39] already
[1:12:41] you don't have to physically go do the
[1:12:43] axi magnify it but what it did is as
[1:12:47] brother branham is saying here about the
[1:12:49] sabbath speaks of the old law which was
[1:12:51] to pass away the keeping of the sabbath
[1:12:54] which passed away or changed from one
[1:12:57] form to the other
[1:12:59] from one form to another well that's the
[1:13:01] same thing see
[1:13:03] uh it changed
[1:13:05] not just there but to us
[1:13:07] as the bride
[1:13:10] it didn't pass away it just changed from
[1:13:13] the old law of keeping a certain day of
[1:13:15] the week
[1:13:16] uh precept must be upon precept here a
[1:13:19] little there a little hold fast that
[1:13:21] which is good stamina lips and other
[1:13:22] tongues i will speak to his people and
[1:13:25] here is the rest
[1:13:27] here is the rest what's that rest
[1:13:29] well he just said
[1:13:31] precept on precept hear a little there a
[1:13:33] little what is that that's the word
[1:13:36] that you hold fast to that word that
[1:13:38] word which is christ the holy spirit in
[1:13:41] you is that rest
[1:13:43] this is
[1:13:44] the rest see you enter into life not
[1:13:47] keeping a day you've entered into life
[1:13:51] not a day not a sabbath not a shadow not
[1:13:55] a law but life
[1:13:57] you've entered into life when you
[1:13:59] receive the holy ghost you've entered
[1:14:01] into life and those things
[1:14:04] change
[1:14:05] they didn't cease to exist they just
[1:14:08] changed
[1:14:10] praise the lord amen now to those who
[1:14:12] want to continue to keep that and they
[1:14:15] want to hold others guilty of that and
[1:14:17] they themselves are guilty holding that
[1:14:19] then those that live by the law must die
[1:14:21] by the law
[1:14:22] yeah those that if you want to try to
[1:14:25] uphold that and hold ever then
[1:14:27] then that becomes your standard then all
[1:14:29] the best thing i can tell you is good
[1:14:31] luck
[1:14:32] there's not a human ever walked this
[1:14:34] planet except jesus christ that's been
[1:14:36] able to keep it
[1:14:37] so if you want to try to keep it by the
[1:14:39] law you go right ahead but i'm going to
[1:14:41] take his grace yes
[1:14:44] now grace doesn't do away with the law
[1:14:47] but grace gives you a way of escape amen
[1:14:50] if this body makes a mistake or
[1:14:51] something then the grace of god is still
[1:14:53] prevalent
[1:14:55] you keep days shadows and things like
[1:14:57] that he said if you if you do that i'm
[1:14:59] scared of your experience see we don't
[1:15:01] pass into certain days and orders you
[1:15:05] pass from death unto life eternal life
[1:15:08] not days not times you pass into
[1:15:12] eternity
[1:15:14] that's the holy convocation that sacred
[1:15:18] holy gathering place
[1:15:20] that calling that god has called this
[1:15:24] convocation
[1:15:26] i don't mean it to sound bad but this
[1:15:28] convocation is not for everybody
[1:15:32] it's only for his
[1:15:34] and it belongs to him

[1:15:54] sacred calling
[1:15:55] it's a sacred assembly it's a sacred
[1:15:58] gathering together of people

[1:16:20] who is it jesus christ amen the promise
[1:16:24] that he gave thousands of years ago the
[1:16:27] promise it came to pass a couple of
[1:16:29] years ago and the promise that god has
[1:16:31] magnified for us in this last day amen
[1:16:36] praise the lord it's past us from death
[1:16:39] unto life yes not a keeping of sabbaths

[1:16:49] passed from death unto life saints
[1:16:52] that's what it is it's life

[1:17:12] but the s-o-n came forth
[1:17:15] and we honor that that's why we meet on
[1:17:17] sundays and we use our sundays mostly as
[1:17:20] sacred times as i guess you'd say a time
[1:17:23] of rest if you will
[1:17:24] amen but it's not sunday
[1:17:28] the bible says that sabbath the lord's
[1:17:31] day which we call the sabbath as the
[1:17:33] lord's day well according to the
[1:17:35] scripture
[1:17:36] uh john the revelator was on the ala
[1:17:38] patmos on the lord's day and he was
[1:17:40] there for two years
[1:17:44] it's a perpetual existence
[1:17:47] it's a perpetual sustaining to all of us
[1:17:51] it doesn't end
[1:17:53] it's just the promise it was given to us
[1:17:55] that we understand that one they will
[1:17:57] sweep even our bodies off of this planet
[1:18:01] praise the lord
[1:18:02] that's the new beginning we're looking
[1:18:03] to
[1:18:04] praise the lord but we're examining the
[1:18:06] scriptures see now that's
[1:18:08] the holy convocation
[1:18:10] that gathering place where do we gather
[1:18:13] we don't gather under
[1:18:15] word of god tabernacle
[1:18:17] we don't gather under some pastor or
[1:18:19] minister preacher

[1:18:23] or some great ministry we gather under
[1:18:25] the auspice of the shed blood of jesus
[1:18:28] christ that is our gathering place

[1:18:53] honest godly sincere people that wanted
[1:18:56] to know

[1:19:12] this is god's house but it's not a bill
[1:19:14] this holy convocation it's not a
[1:19:15] building
[1:19:16] amen it's not it's not a a a pastor or
[1:19:20] or a name or
[1:19:21] it's under christ
[1:19:24] that's the only place it could be so
[1:19:26] that holy convocation is the meeting
[1:19:28] place that we all meet under that shed
[1:19:30] blood
[1:19:31] seven days
[1:19:32] is uh which pass away or i have said i'm
[1:19:36] continuing on with this quote now
[1:19:38] we'll change to another eight days deals
[1:19:41] with new creation
[1:19:43] not all creation new creation eight days
[1:19:47] is new creation for it was on the eighth
[1:19:50] day that our lord raised from the dead
[1:19:53] now hold that as i've said a minute ago
[1:19:55] and read here now hold back
[1:19:58] because we're going to read something a
[1:19:59] minute to confirm that
[1:20:01] eighth day our lord raised from the dead
[1:20:03] on the eighth day there's your holy
[1:20:05] convocation the holiness
[1:20:08] it's not even considered in status
[1:20:11] feasted days feasted tabernacles this
[1:20:14] that pentecost jesus raised from the
[1:20:16] dead for our justification on the eighth
[1:20:18] day
[1:20:19] that is that beginning or new day that
[1:20:22] when he rose we rose with him
[1:20:26] new
[1:20:27] fresh
[1:20:28] new beginning
[1:20:29] praise the lord god gives us that that
[1:20:32] spirit now i want to go to revelation
[1:20:36] chapter 10. and i want to follow this
[1:20:38] quote up with this and then we'll go
[1:20:40] back to genesis and finish this
[1:20:47] revelation i already kind of handed to
[1:20:49] you what the next bit is going to be
[1:20:53] amen it's going to be on that rest
[1:20:56] on that rest try to lay the foundation
[1:20:59] so far and we'll see and get in and look
[1:21:02] at the scripture
[1:21:03] and that and how meaningful that is to
[1:21:06] us
[1:21:07] and how we can rest
[1:21:09] amen don't lose faith
[1:21:11] saints
[1:21:12] believe no god is with you god's hand is
[1:21:15] upon you
[1:21:17] and
[1:21:18] don't get the devil to make you
[1:21:20] disbelieve who you are
[1:21:22] because that's the number one thing he
[1:21:24] tries to do is to try to first thing he
[1:21:25] tries to do is get you disbelieve who
[1:21:27] you are
[1:21:28] then he tries to get to get you to
[1:21:30] disbelieve what god said
[1:21:32] he said well brother you how do you know
[1:21:33] that that's the exact same thing he did
[1:21:35] in the garden of eden from the very
[1:21:36] beginning that's been his tactics it's
[1:21:37] the same today it's always been yeah
[1:21:41] get you to doubt
[1:21:42] get you to disbelieve now revelation
[1:21:44] chapter 10 was built on this quote for a
[1:21:46] minute
[1:21:47] jesus christ
[1:21:50] that convocation
[1:21:52] he said in revelation 10 1 and i saw
[1:21:54] john the revelator saw another
[1:21:57] mighty angel
[1:21:59] come down from heaven
[1:22:00] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:22:04] upon his head
[1:22:06] praise the lord
[1:22:08] and his face where is it where the sun
[1:22:10] and his feet is pillars of fire now who
[1:22:11] is that
[1:22:13] that's jesus christ
[1:22:15] the covenant angel
[1:22:17] the covenant angel with a rainbow upon
[1:22:20] his head why because god had already
[1:22:22] given that token 4 000 years ago
[1:22:25] back after the andalusian flood that was
[1:22:27] the token that god gave
[1:22:29] was that rainbow
[1:22:31] and that covenant angel that came down
[1:22:34] here uh in revelation 10 is no more than
[1:22:37] or no other than jesus christ
[1:22:40] providing the
[1:22:42] the
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:44] togetherness the cohesiveness
[1:22:47] of bringing the old testament and the
[1:22:50] new testament together amen as the
[1:22:52] covenant angel
[1:22:54] that covenant that still holds true
[1:22:56] today
[1:22:58] it wasn't just a rainbow it wasn't just
[1:23:00] christ it wasn't where we're at all that
[1:23:02] god has done he continues to bring forth
[1:23:06] and that covenant angel
[1:23:08] that is the holy convocation god's
[1:23:10] promise god's promise is the same today
[1:23:12] as it was then god will absolutely never
[1:23:16] flood the earth again like he did there
[1:23:17] and destroy all man all animals all bees
[1:23:21] now there's floods around floods happen
[1:23:23] all the time but that wasn't the promise
[1:23:25] the promise said he would not kill all
[1:23:27] humanity and all human and all animal
[1:23:29] life with it that was the promise and he
[1:23:32] hasn't and he will not praise the lord
[1:23:34] because that was the just like you that
[1:23:37] was the world's baptism
[1:23:39] just like you
[1:23:41] jesus his blood shed on this earth was
[1:23:45] justification that was his
[1:23:47] holy baptism uh
[1:23:50] sanctification
[1:23:52] and then the world's going to receive
[1:23:54] inspiring baptism just like we did jesus
[1:23:58] that covenant angel was that one with
[1:24:00] the rainbow over his head now let's go
[1:24:02] back to the rainbow for a second and
[1:24:04] we'll finish this in genesis chapter 5
[1:24:12] not nine but remember
[1:24:14] after noah and his family left the ark
[1:24:17] they entered into
[1:24:19] an eighth day
[1:24:21] i'm gonna say that i know the scripture
[1:24:22] doesn't say that but they entered into
[1:24:24] an eighth day they entered into a time
[1:24:27] where god said come out of the ark and
[1:24:29] go forth and be fruitful and multiply to
[1:24:32] where again that whole land around them
[1:24:34] is known as the land of eight
[1:24:36] where they came out from the ark the
[1:24:38] land of eight now genesis chapter five
[1:24:41] continuing and
[1:24:42] finish up with this this rest
[1:24:45] this rest look
[1:24:47] we'll find the parallels here because
[1:24:48] it's very meaningful things and as i
[1:24:50] studied it it it meant more to me than
[1:24:52] ever
[1:24:54] uh genesis chapter 5 verse 28.
[1:24:59] and lamech lived in
[1:25:01] 182 years and begot a son
[1:25:05] remember
[1:25:08] last week when we read this scripture
[1:25:11] and it talked about
[1:25:12] so and so had so and so and then a bunch
[1:25:14] of other sons and daughters
[1:25:16] and he had so and so at this this man
[1:25:19] had uh this son
[1:25:21] at this age and then he had a bunch of
[1:25:23] sons and daughters and he had a this man
[1:25:26] had this son at this age and then a
[1:25:28] bunch of other sons and daughters so
[1:25:31] but this the pattern was changed here
[1:25:34] and there's a reason
[1:25:35] as we know the reason
[1:25:38] that lamock lived 182 years and begot a
[1:25:41] son
[1:25:44] and he called his name noah
[1:25:47] saying
[1:25:48] now see this this isn't any others but
[1:25:51] this one he called his name noah saying
[1:25:54] the same shall comfort us
[1:25:58] concerning our work and toil of our
[1:26:00] hands because of the ground which the
[1:26:02] lord god had cursed
[1:26:04] noah
[1:26:06] shall comfort us concerning this work
[1:26:10] how would noah comfort us well if you go
[1:26:12] and look in the
[1:26:13] in the hebrew you'll find noah's name
[1:26:16] means rest
[1:26:19] no his name means rest
[1:26:21] so when he named we talked about the
[1:26:23] need the significance of enoch's name we
[1:26:26] talked about the significance of
[1:26:27] methuselah's name we talked about the
[1:26:29] significance of lima but now noah's name
[1:26:32] as each one has had that significance
[1:26:35] and we talked about the significance of
[1:26:37] names
[1:26:38] how important it is uh the name is
[1:26:42] tacked on you it's very important
[1:26:44] that god
[1:26:46] through lama named noah
[1:26:49] and he named him noah for rest why
[1:26:52] because he knew what noah was going
[1:26:54] through before he was coming out and
[1:26:56] what he was going to represent
[1:26:59] thus
[1:27:00] thus
[1:27:01] he comforts us that comforting
[1:27:04] concerning our work and the toil of our
[1:27:06] hands
[1:27:08] that you can rest
[1:27:10] our toil
[1:27:12] the toil of our hands
[1:27:14] the work of our hands
[1:27:15] that we go through the curse of the
[1:27:17] ground that god cursed and guarded me he
[1:27:20] didn't curse adam now he cursed the
[1:27:21] ground
[1:27:23] but then god promised the ground
[1:27:25] did you notice that we read the
[1:27:26] scripture earlier i didn't point it out
[1:27:29] but i wanted you to see it god also
[1:27:32] promised the ground
[1:27:34] you want to go back and see it again
[1:27:35] yeah let's go back revelate uh genesis
[1:27:38] chapter nine let's go see
[1:27:41] and this is a tote 12th first cell
[1:27:44] uh
[1:27:46] well let me see
[1:27:48] let's start back with the 11th verse and
[1:27:50] i will establish my covenant with you
[1:27:52] talking to noah
[1:27:54] neither shall neither shall all flesh be
[1:27:56] cut off any more of the waters of the
[1:27:58] flood neither shall there be any more
[1:28:00] there any more shall be a flood to
[1:28:02] destroy the earth and god said this is
[1:28:04] the token of the covenant which i make
[1:28:07] between me and you
[1:28:09] and
[1:28:10] every living creature that is with you
[1:28:12] for perpetual generations his old
[1:28:15] brother you know that's not the earth
[1:28:16] listen
[1:28:17] 13th verse i do set my bow in the cloud
[1:28:21] and it shall be for a token of a
[1:28:23] covenant between me and who
[1:28:27] the earth
[1:28:29] it's not just it wasn't just noah and
[1:28:31] his family it wasn't even just the
[1:28:33] animals this was a promise god made to
[1:28:36] the earth
[1:28:37] that god had cursed when the original
[1:28:40] sin took place he didn't curse adam he
[1:28:43] cursed the ground
[1:28:45] remember and now
[1:28:47] god is telling the earth i promise you
[1:28:50] this will never happen again
[1:28:53] noah animals earth
[1:28:56] remember that that's where we all came
[1:28:58] from anyway all right it's from the
[1:29:00] earth
[1:29:01] praise the lord our baptism now
[1:29:03] noah's being named
[1:29:05] noah because noah means
[1:29:08] rest what is rest what does it mean to
[1:29:11] us to rest rest nor means rest look at
[1:29:14] the comparisons here before we move on
[1:29:17] look at the comparisons noah
[1:29:20] his name means rest
[1:29:22] to rest not not the rest of something
[1:29:26] but to rest the physical activity or if
[1:29:29] you can call it that of resting
[1:29:32] at the end of the andaluvian world or
[1:29:35] let's start from the beginning after
[1:29:36] creation we see on the seventh day god
[1:29:41] rested
[1:29:43] after the andalumian flood
[1:29:45] lament before that
[1:29:47] named noah rest
[1:29:50] named him noah rest
[1:29:53] at the end of bc as we know it came
[1:29:56] forth jesus christ our next new
[1:29:57] beginning
[1:29:59] jesus christ came forth and said come
[1:30:01] unto me
[1:30:02] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:30:04] and i will do what
[1:30:07] give you
[1:30:08] rest where's that rest so we work harder
[1:30:10] than we ever have saints but where's the
[1:30:12] rest
[1:30:14] the rest is not this body the rest is
[1:30:16] not the spirit that won't rest until we
[1:30:18] get to the other side but in our soul
[1:30:21] there's a rest yes because that soul is
[1:30:24] entered to that place of eternity where
[1:30:26] there's peace
[1:30:28] where there's the faith in god if you've
[1:30:30] got that faith in god saints again
[1:30:32] that's where that peace and that rest
[1:30:33] lies jesus came forth and said come unto
[1:30:36] me all you labor and heavy laden and i
[1:30:38] will give you rest now what about the
[1:30:40] end of this
[1:30:41] amen we go to the
[1:30:43] the wedding supper but then we come back
[1:30:45] to this earth again and we and then
[1:30:48] there's a millennium kingdom set up
[1:30:50] and that millennium means what
[1:30:53] rest it's a time of rest oh yeah we will
[1:30:57] build and inhabit the buildings and we
[1:30:59] will plant and we will eat
[1:31:01] that that we planted and those that we
[1:31:02] know that but it's a but it's a it's a
[1:31:05] place of rest
[1:31:07] the the thing that
[1:31:10] burdens us the most
[1:31:12] is that the toil of our hand or our mind
[1:31:14] is the spirits that we have to battle
[1:31:16] every day to do yes
[1:31:18] that's the real struggle
[1:31:20] that's the thing that rips and zaps and
[1:31:22] sucks every bit of life that it can out
[1:31:25] of you every day yeah and even night
[1:31:27] when you're tossing to and fro trying to
[1:31:29] get some sleep where do you think that
[1:31:31] comes from
[1:31:33] that's the devil
[1:31:34] amen but with him out of the picture
[1:31:37] it's rest
[1:31:39] perfect rest in the millennium there'll
[1:31:41] be rest
[1:31:42] just like jesus had in the beginning now
[1:31:45] as christ that covenant angel i'm going
[1:31:47] to close here that covenant angel come
[1:31:49] the rainbow upon his head
[1:31:51] that that was that covenant angel look
[1:31:53] at the rainbow promise that god gave as
[1:31:56] a covenant
[1:31:57] amen that's what he said as a covenant
[1:31:59] as a token as a covenant this is my
[1:32:02] promise to you i promise you this will
[1:32:05] never happen again
[1:32:06] that covenant angel that rainbow in
[1:32:09] itself
[1:32:11] you can look out there and say
[1:32:13] it's a it's a constant reminder of
[1:32:16] course we don't get a constant reminder
[1:32:17] of it because it's only about this time
[1:32:19] of year we actually see rainbows but
[1:32:21] when we do see a rainbow
[1:32:23] we know what it means
[1:32:25] i don't know about you saints but every
[1:32:26] time i see a rainbow i was flying the
[1:32:28] other day we were going through some
[1:32:30] clouds and it looked like it was a
[1:32:31] rainbow going all the way around the
[1:32:33] plane i couldn't tell for sure but when
[1:32:35] you look out it started as far as i
[1:32:37] could see it started up here and went
[1:32:38] like this i can only assume
[1:32:41] but it's that
[1:32:43] that promise that god made now
[1:32:45] scientifically
[1:32:46] it's when light hits the water crystals
[1:32:50] and it reflects and retracts an item on
[1:32:52] my i don't know all those words you're
[1:32:54] probably smarter than i am but
[1:32:56] when it does all that then it produces
[1:32:58] these beautiful colors
[1:33:00] amen who did that
[1:33:02] that's god how many colors does the
[1:33:04] rainbow how does it produce in the
[1:33:06] rainbow
[1:33:08] well they say it produces seven when you
[1:33:11] look at the light you look at the
[1:33:13] rainbow
[1:33:14] red orange green blue indigo violet i
[1:33:18] think are the
[1:33:20] set seven colors they say anyway you
[1:33:22] know the rainbow when you look at it
[1:33:23] ain't meshed together all the time but
[1:33:26] to me what it is i'll tell you what it
[1:33:28] represents to me of course the seven is
[1:33:30] completion but what it represents to me
[1:33:32] and i don't know about you again when i
[1:33:34] see a rainbow
[1:33:36] it does something to me
[1:33:38] it calms my spirit it really does but
[1:33:40] when you see that rainbow that'd be nice
[1:33:42] to see more of them
[1:33:44] what it is representing to me is the sun
[1:33:48] shining on the dark cloud
[1:33:50] that produces god's covenant
[1:33:53] you know what takes a dark cloud to
[1:33:56] produce that covenant
[1:33:59] amen i know we don't enjoy the dark
[1:34:01] clouds of our life friend but it takes a
[1:34:04] dark cloud to produce the covenant the
[1:34:06] rainbow
[1:34:08] the sun
[1:34:10] in itself doesn't produce a rainbow
[1:34:13] but when the sun hits your dark clouds
[1:34:15] so when you're sitting there
[1:34:17] and you're huntering over under the
[1:34:19] darkest cloud of your life just remember
[1:34:22] just let the sun come up a little bit
[1:34:25] god's promise will come forward
[1:34:28] and you can look at it and you can rest
[1:34:30] in your heart and your spirit and know
[1:34:32] who is in control
[1:34:34] because from the very first time god put
[1:34:36] that bow in this scripture on this earth
[1:34:39] it's the same today yes that's my
[1:34:41] covenant that's my promise that's my
[1:34:44] word that's my rest rest in it
[1:34:47] we can rest in it it becomes something
[1:34:50] to me it means something
[1:34:53] amen it means something to me it should
[1:34:56] put your spirit at rest because god's
[1:34:58] promises are just as true today as
[1:35:00] they've always been
[1:35:02] god rested
[1:35:04] know his name rest jesus come unto me
[1:35:06] and rest we're going to arrest
[1:35:08] millennium now i know he said do no
[1:35:10] silver work in the eighth day but that's
[1:35:12] eternity friends that that's rolling
[1:35:14] over the satans in the lake of fire then
[1:35:16] there'll be no more tempter then
[1:35:19] praise the lord when we get there it's
[1:35:21] nothing but perpetual rest but as of now
[1:35:24] we still have that rest
[1:35:27] just rest in it
[1:35:29] just rest in him
[1:35:31] let him be your rest your portion
[1:35:35] call upon not just our faculties and
[1:35:38] our our flesh or our spirit
[1:35:41] but the soul
[1:35:43] where god lives
[1:35:46] and recognize he's got everything under
[1:35:48] control
[1:35:50] nothing happens but why he doesn't know
[1:35:52] it
[1:35:54] and everything that he does he will
[1:35:58] he will
[1:36:00] he
[1:36:00] absolutely 100
[1:36:04] will
[1:36:04] make it work together for your good yes
[1:36:08] if
[1:36:09] you love him
[1:36:10] amen not just have a passing affinity
[1:36:13] people say well the scripture says this
[1:36:15] but this didn't happen it's not you
[1:36:17] can't just have some passing affinity
[1:36:19] for god
[1:36:20] it can't just be a part-time thing it's
[1:36:23] got to be you and him relationship
[1:36:26] amen what kind of a relationship would
[1:36:28] it be with my wife when i if i just
[1:36:30] showed up once every month and said hey
[1:36:32] how you doing see you later
[1:36:35] i mean you wouldn't have much of a
[1:36:36] relationship you showed up at the door
[1:36:38] or knocked on the door don't even have a
[1:36:40] key anymore
[1:36:42] amen just like just like the hoffman
[1:36:44] painting where jesus is standing there
[1:36:46] and there's not even a doorknob on for
[1:36:47] him to open it
[1:36:49] be the same relationship
[1:36:51] but if you truly love him if you have an
[1:36:54] unconditional faith-based loving god
[1:36:58] everything will work together for your
[1:37:00] good yes
[1:37:02] rest on it
[1:37:04] well if he did it at the if he did it
[1:37:06] then
[1:37:07] and all through at the end of the
[1:37:09] creation at the end of the andalusian at
[1:37:11] the time jesus came will he do the same
[1:37:13] thing today
[1:37:15] put you his children
[1:37:17] in a place of perpetual rest
[1:37:20] i just things that happen every day that
[1:37:22] we don't understand
[1:37:24] comprehend
[1:37:25] maybe not even agree with
[1:37:27] god i didn't agree with you doing that
[1:37:30] doesn't matter
[1:37:31] i love you and yeah
[1:37:33] i believe you anyhow
[1:37:34] amen it's going to work out yes as you
[1:37:37] promised it would and i still believe
[1:37:39] you i'm still here i'm still standing on
[1:37:42] the promises of your word yes praise the
[1:37:44] lord rest in insane
[1:37:47] rest let's stand if we could
[1:37:56] remember
[1:37:58] takes a dark cloud
[1:38:01] to produce that covenant rainbow
[1:38:04] rain a dark cloud has got to exist
[1:38:06] before the sun can produce that rainbow
[1:38:09] make those
[1:38:10] water droplets
[1:38:12] retract reflect whatever it does to
[1:38:14] bring those beautiful colors
[1:38:16] amen god promised it he said in the
[1:38:19] bible we read it when there's a cloud
[1:38:22] you'll see my bow there
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:25] god's word now the cloud itself doesn't
[1:38:27] do anything but when the sun hits it
[1:38:30] that's when it produces
[1:38:32] when god's allowed to shine in your life
[1:38:35] that's when it will produce itself
[1:38:38] and it'll produce rest
[1:38:40] amen it'll produce rest if we have faith
[1:38:43] to believe it it'll produce rest
[1:38:45] amen let's sing that course
