told us to watch that you'll unless you're prayed up and watching i'll come as a thief in the night and lord this night is this is not a time for us to be relaxed for us to take things for granted to us for us to live in any way like the world it's time to let go and let god have you rule and reign in our hearts it's time to be prayed up to to look every day for your coming father and lord help us

you father yes and lord bless our pastor lord as he labors with you your word and you speak through them to feed our hearts you know as your word says faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god and without faith it's impossible to please god let our hearts rejoice as we hear your word may our hearts burn within us amen as we met with you along the way this morning and you're saying we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord you can be seated if you like we have several praise reports today thankful amen the one we have that one's oh this is of course

the lord wonderful amen they say it doesn't matter in or out of the womb friend it does to god yes uh sister patricia has a testimony had the mri friday uh pray the doctor finds all is well amen uh pray my double vision will go away that was a prayer request i'm sorry i looked at it and thought it was a praise report so maybe that's prophetic amen we'll just take that i'll take that praise amen so sister pat had the mri friday all will be well and the double vision is gone in the name of jesus praise the lord amen uh sister julie had uh a couple praise reports uh to mention even with the situation with her uh truck she went to the eye doctor she told me she wrote in the text and she'd been praying for years that the lord would restore her eyes back to 2020 and she went back to she went to the optometrist the other day the optometrist told her that her eyesight is getting better uh her her prescription on her contacts had changed a half of a half a number whatever that means but it had gotten better and she i don't know about you but i've never gone to optometers and said my eyes were better uh except it be the work of the lord so she's very thankful the lord had touched her and uh touched her eyes and she had one more request and uh one more praise report and our job promotion thank you brother dennis she did get the job promotion she has signed the letter um acceptance letter and she starts on her new position the 15th so praise the lord so those are the two prayer rep praise reports that she had also uh had the privilege of uh baptizing brother hobby yesterday as we mentioned last sunday [Music] javier is sister sheila's grandson step technically step grandson but they don't consider him a step uh shariah's brother so i had the privilege of baptizing him yesterday got to talk to him for a little bit uh i was very pleased and honored that he asked me to baptize him honestly uh i've known the family obviously for a long time but i haven't really known javi very well because we had the school and when the school um the first couple of years of the school he wasn't there and then me and my family moved up to the white mountains and were there for a few years and that's the few years that javi attended the school when we got back and started working in school again he was gone he had graduated so i i never really spent very much time with him uh but i got to talk to him yesterday got to know him uh he really feels the lord moving in his life uh he actually has been giving up on the weekends at like 4 a.m and going up in the mountains and read his bible and pray and i said lord god will talk to a man like that yes it doesn't matter anything else and so i felt uh when we had i saw him at chariza's birthday dinner and i knew something was different about him and he made an effort to come over and speak to me but then when he asked me the other day if i baptized them it was it was quite an honor yesterday there were several of us that were there uh and uh just had a good time the lord it was a very good time uh and i'm just looking for wonderful things the lord to do with javier so um i appreciate that appreciate god's goodness so amen sister norma has a song she wants to sing for us today so she'll go ahead and come amen do you want to have a testimony on your heart when she comes my mind all three or four hands went up at one time good to have brother dennis back amen go ahead brother okay um i want to thank the lord that my wife got over pretty quickly and now she's doing much better and also this week our lower motor went out in our ac and thank god we have a good ac man and he got the motor in within two and a half days and he he charged me almost at the price of just putting it in wow so we're thankful for all that the lord does amen praise the lord have brother danny back too amen praise the lord brother pat you got a short one and she comes no oh it's just not sure okay we'll wait till after she gets done praise the lord i thank the lord for healing my body and for saving my family amen you all pray for me on your time i try to sing because i'm not a singer uh satan attacks my lungs but he's a liar so here i am my heart is like a house one day i left the savior in [Music] but one day he saw that door i knew the day come too soon i said jesus i'm not ready for us to visit that room cause that's the place in my heart where i don't even go off i have some things hidden there i don't want no one to know but he handed me the key with tears of love on his face he said i wanna make you clean left me in your secret place so i opened up the door and as the two of us walked in i was so ashamed his life revealed my hidden sin [Music] but when i think about that place now i'm not afraid anymore cause i know my hidden sin no longer hides behind [Music] i had some things in there [Music] amen now is there a place in your heart [Music] [Music] yes [Music] amen [Applause] i'm not a speaker but the lord's come to me this week [Music] get a message from brother brandon no i don't need a message from brother brandon we need a message from the lord well the lord says he gave the message to brother himself brother man's where i got it i'm just going to read the scripture i don't want the word to be mine my [Music] the holy spirit guided me to this and they shall turn away their ears from the truth for a time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they heap up to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall fall away they shall turn they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables this departure is at hand that's just what we gave you for today that's the scripture this day this scripture is fulfilled amen amen amen praise the lord be thankful to the lord jesus today yes amen he's so good to us add another song we'll just go ahead and get to the word though now amen maybe uh afterwards we'll look to that but let's stand to our feet if we could now somewhat the scripture testifying of itself today amen let's turn into turn in our bibles to proverbs we're going to go to proverbs chapter 29. proverbs 29 we'll just read a verse of scripture here amen like we said before you know we always look forward to the time that the lord blessed us on this earth and the end times the time that we live and uh that the things that are going on today is uh just hard to imagine but thank god he's got it all under control amen he's got it all under control proverbs 29 we'll read one verse of scripture but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer and then lord jesus father we're very privileged to be here today and we thank you so much for the grace and love and mercy that you give us thank you for this time of fellowship around your word lord and looking for you to speak to us now god from it lord may you reveal it to our hearts and show us in there what you have us to see and know because we're a needy people today lord we're more needful now than we've ever been and for that revelation that word to minister to our hearts and to open itself to us and for you to reveal yourself in a special way father lord we just come with great expectation anticipation of what you'll do for us in this service today coming in this sanctuary out from the world lord expecting to meet with you once again you promise that we're two or three are together in your name you'll be there in the midst and we know you to be here because you are the same yesterday today and forever thank you for the blessings of your word for these people that have come those who may be streaming lord we just pray as we commit it all to you and trust you that it'd be a sweet-smelling savior in your sight lord we rebuke every demonic spirit and we try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here now for we do it all in your precious lovely name in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen proverbs 29 18 we'll just read verse 18 and we'll let you be seated amen proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he you can be seated if you like i want you to want to speak on a thought that came on my heart the other day uh about what is our vision and then what is our vision because the bible's here uh the most wisest man in the world put this in the scripture uh solomon said without a vision people perish so to keep from perishing or going away from god uh there is to be a vision there is to be something that keeps us motivated keeps us moving keeps our eyes projected in a place in a way that is going to edify us and bless and build us up and keep us moving forward with him so many people today get stagnant and and their their experience gets stagnant and their relationship with the lord gets stagnant and their uh their uh experience in church and the things that they do for the lord they just kind of grow old and they kind of grow stagnant but there always must be a vision that vision should always be before us and as that vision is before us it is to be what is to propel us and to keep us pressing toward as paul said pressing towards that mark of the call of the of the high calling in christ jesus and to keep pressing is it's hard to do if you don't feel like there's something that you're pressing towards it's hard to keep that energy that effort that that vision if you don't feel like there's something that's there that you're that you're shooting for that you're aiming for that you're that you're working towards without that vision the people perish that people go away so that vision is what we want to talk about today and look at and examine our lives and finding out what is our vision what is my vision what is your vision so many times our vision gets on so many other things satan is going to make sure and put all kinds of things in front of us so that our vision gets put on that or our vision gets put on uh the world's condition or who's in the white house or what our government's about or sometimes we get our vision on what our bank account looks like or uh sometimes we get our eyes our vision focused on on a church or or even on a pastor or on a man or something or we get our vision off on somebody else or family or something but i want us to understand while all those things would be important in a person's life all those things mean something to us in our lives our vision as a christian our number one vision our number one goal our number one drive our number one thing that we shoot for continually and always keep our focus and our vision on is christ our vision should never sway to get off on something that's inconsequential something that's not significant to our eternal salvation or something that's uh that the lord's working out anyway you know so many times the things happen and we don't understand why or things come about and we can't explain them we sometimes can't understand them but god always has a reason and god always has a way and god always takes care of it and we we know that as many of us are seasoned christians to understand that of how many times the lord has brought us through and so that our vision can maintain on that one focus and that is him our focus our vision should always be on him our focus our vision should always be on trying to help others uh become christians others to get the same vision others to let christ be their vision it should always be our goal to try to help those that are in need those that are striving and and and sometimes even in desperation and in prayer and and whatever we can do to keep that vision because you know the number one way that we know that we love the lord jesus is that we love one another yes we can't say that we love him unless we love each other and if we don't love each other then how can anybody say i mean uh john says that how can we say we love him when we don't love each other how can i say i love god if i don't even love you and if i don't show how much i love you or produce or prove how much i love you then what good are my words i can say i love you all but all i want but if you get in the moment of need and i'm not there for you if if i don't if i have a possibility or way to help you and don't do it if i shut up my bowels of compassion against you how dwell is the love of god in me no matter what i say so if i if i say that i love him then then my love must first be to you amen because without loving you i can't love him right amen i can't love him without loving you so our vision is not just as we say well uh i'm focused on christ and that's number one absolutely it should always be but in but in conjunction to that is that we look at on the needs of others yes and and let our vision be on how can i help somebody else what can i do for somebody else how can i make this better or easier i mean i told you i i was more than honored please blessed to be able to baptize javi yesterday but the moment he asked me there there was never a doubt in my mind he asked me if if i would if it would be okay or if you would be available i said brother i will be available whatever i've got to do i will be available i will be there i will do it amen there just wasn't a question they say well i i don't know i i i can't do this or just all the excuses obstacles you know we always we have a life full of excuses reasons for this excuses for that of course i think there's differences in excuses and reasons but an excuse is just a way to get out of something and basically end up doing pretty much what you want to do anyway but the bottom line is always our focus our vision should always be on him and what can i do for him for jesus christ what can i do for him the best thing that i can do for him is to is to do what i can for you to do what i can and i don't mean just these four walls i don't mean just this church i mean hobby doesn't even come here never been here but that doesn't matter that's not the point the point is what can we do for one another as humans as christians as as a body of believers amen because that's what our vision leads us to so what is our vision what keeps you motivated what keeps you driving what keeps you persevering right what keeps you pressing toward believing that you are i'm just going to trust and believe you are what keeps you pressing towards that mark what keeps you motivated to continue to press this battle cause friend you know this battle gets hard as you know as well as i do this this is not a flowery bed of ease that we've chosen to walk this is a godly christian today i mean even god told us in the scripture those who live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution i mean that just comes with the territory so you know it's not an easy walk so what keeps you pressing what is the vision that you have that keeps you pushing and pressing what vision did you have that brought you here to church today did you come because of me lord i hope not you could be sorely disappointed if you come here for me did you come here because you wanted to see somebody else and you come here because you had nothing better to do why did you come today what was the vision that brought you here what drove you to this place what drove you to continue to live for the lord what what is it that is put before you that that keeps you going that keeps your eyes on him that keeps your vision on christ because that vision is the only thing that's going to keep you that's what's going to keep you bring you to the end point it's like this is probably a horrible analogy but it's kind of like the carrot at the end of the stick you know the carrot dangling in front of the the person at the end of the stick they just keep going and keep going and keep reaching and keep reaching and the carrot just stays out there uh that's probably not a good analogy because that's not exactly the way this works but it's something that keeps that person motivated or or or they've even done that with animals and keep something in front of that animal it'll just keep running and running and running and running thinking it's going to get to that to that end result that's a facade where we know the reality of jesus christ and that final that finish line is there if you keep your eyes on your vision on him let's look at a couple of places in the scripture um as we delve into this say john chapter 3 saint john chapter 3 verse 1. and then we'll start with verse 1. saint john chapter 3 verse 1. and you know the story very well most of you so we'll just kind of skim through it but i want us to see the point i'm trying to get to now there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him now nicodemus was the only one of that group of that sect that actually said these words to jesus he's the only one of them so you can imagine that as he verbalized this to christ that of the talks that went on behind closed doors between the pharisees and sadducees and some of the things that they would say now the sad part of this is is that he says that we know so my question then would be who is this we he's come there on his own at night no doubt no less he come at night by himself who is he representing because he said we know that thou art a teacher come from god no man can do these miracles except that god be with him who is he talking about so obviously all the talking that these that ended up crucifying him uh we're talking about it behind closed doors nicodemus was actually verbalizing we know that that thou art a teacher sent from god because nobody can do what you do unless god is with him amen jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god now that's pretty straight amen it's pretty understandable unless you be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god but look at what nicus did look at what nicodemus's vision is nicodemus had said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the uh enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born so you see what nicodemus's vision is jesus is trying to give him a spiritual vision but only vision that he can see is a natural vision so the vision that he had is not something that's keeping him continuing his vision is a temporal when the vision that jesus is trying to offer to nicodemus is an eternal spiritual vision except a man be born again he cannot see this the kingdom of god now what is that that's that the spiritual birth of course in the spirit realm uh that new birth of the the soul that a person experiences in this life when he is born again his old nature dies and christ comes and lives in him amen but that's not nicodemus vision so what is his vision about his vision is the same vision a lot of people have today it's something of the natural it's the same way a lot of people try to interpret or try to read or understand the scripture it's the same way that so many people try to explain the scripture and try to uh do away with its validity or try to say that oh it contradicts itself well to the natural mind to a human understanding it probably does look that way but if you take god at his word and let the lord reveal that word to you open to just like what jesus was saying you read in the natural if nicodemus is reading the word of god in the natural it looks like an impossibility for a human to be born again right does it not without spiritual understanding in revelation all you understand or see all your vision is how can i crawl it excuse me but in my mother's womb and be born again how can i do that see that's all the person's vision is and that's exactly what so many people get out of the scripture all they get out is the superficial uh human understanding of what they're reading instead of letting the holy spirit that wrote the bible reveal it to you and let you see and open it to you something new a newer vision a spiritual vision a vision that's not just temporal here on earth it'll take you from point a to point b but will take you beyond into the eternities that's what jesus was offering to nicodemus he was trying to offer him something that was in eternity not just here on this earth but of eternity it made me think when i was praying to you this morning about the things that we hear you know outside of maybe plugging our ears or getting earplugs or something like that you can't really control what goes into your ears unfortunately uh you can't really control that but you can control what goes in what you hear in your heart you can control that you can stop anything that does not belong there from dropping from here to here you can do that you might not can stop it here but you can stop and hear you've got control over that yes amen and that spiritual light that jesus is offering to nicodemus he cannot see it because he's looking through the wrong knives he's looking in the wrong place amen first of all he's looking at jesus obviously as he says here as a teacher come from god instead of god building flesh that's his first mistake and then so so you see it matters at what your vision is it matters what eyes you're looking through it matters what you're looking at it matters what what spiritual revelation or understanding that you have as to what your vision is right because you could take how you could take any number of people in the world today so what's your vision or or your eyes on jesus or are you looking at jesus amen and oh yeah certainly am but in what way nicodemus was looking at jesus too but what way was he looking at it he was looking at him in a whole different way than what those that are born again of the spirit of god understanding by revelation the word look at him nicodemus was looking at him in a different way than we look at christ today amen he saw he just saw a teacher he just saw a man a teacher that was sent from god instead of when you look at him what do you see god bailed in flesh amen that's how that's who i see how could a man enter into his mother's womb the second time jesus answered verily verily i say unto ye uh to thee accept a man be born of water and of the spirit now he's trying to expound it to him to try to get him to get to that place water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god not enter into your mother's womb but enter into the kingdom of god must be by water spirit praise the lord just like birth is today water blood life water blood spirit this is a natural birth water blood life it's the three steps that god always has god works in numerology amen the three steps water water blood spirits the same thing that spirit that come he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit marvel not that i said unto you ye must be borned again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearst the sound thereof but cast not tell whence he cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be his vision has not changed no matter what christ is trying to explain to him no matter how in detail he's trying to get him to understand his vision stays the same his vision is only on the natural right his vision is only on the temporal his vision is only on what he can see touch feel smell or hear his vision even though jesus told him about the spirit the supernatural his vision hasn't gone beyond that to see what the revelation that god was trying to get to him to understand right he could not see it amen and that's not necessarily his fault but he could not see it how can these things be then jesus goes and says said unto him are thou a master of israel and knoweth not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye received not our witness if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and moses and as moses lifted up the serpent of the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son speaking of himself here that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life perish should not perish so look look at verse 16 very popular christian scripture i've told you many times about how this is the first scripture i learned growing up as a baptist boy in a baptist church in north carolina how this was the first scripture that we're taught uh as we're growing up in a baptist church for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believed in him shall not perish but look at this should not perish what was it that solomon told us in proverbs 29 without a vision what happens amen without a vision you perish so where is that vision when jesus comes and basically gives us along the same lines of of that scripture god loved the world he gave his son to die and shed his blood that whosoever believeth in him should not perish should not perish whoever has that vision whoever receives that not nicodemus vision as he's speaking to nicodemus but the spiritual vision the spiritual revelation of who jesus christ is which is exactly what he ended up telling his disciples oh man who who do you say the son of man uh who do they say the son of man is oh some say you're elias and the prophets and this that and the other jesus got personal and said who do you say that i am thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed art thou simon for flesh and blood did not reveal this flesh and blood did not reveal it but my father in heaven has revealed this to you revealed what who jesus is amen not was is who is he what is that vision that jesus is telling us in the 16th verse here that will keep us from perishing now what does that perish that parish is not a physical parish because there's a lot of people today that denounce and do not and will not believe jesus christ and they're just as alive as anybody with blood coursing through their veins they can talk they can smell they can live their lives what's this perish that he's talking about it's a spiritual death it's a it's a separation from god just like in the garden of eden what was that death god told adam you do this you'll die adam did that did he die not physically right but there was a separation that took place between god and man yes you never read after that where god came down in the cool of the evening and spoke with adam lift to ear like he did before the fall didn't do it anymore because it was a separation what was this to be our vision now jesus giving us a new vision what is it it's the coming back together of god in man how through jesus christ and the blood that he shed at calvary was to bring the man and the human uh the god and the man back together again blessed is that man that sees this and knows that that word is being revealed to his heart and that vision of who jesus christ is the same one he told his disciples the same one back in the garden of eden the same one that solomon told us in proverbs 29 is the same vision that we are to have today that same vision if we have that we will not perish yes but have everlasting life amen now again to understand this parish is not a physical parish it's an understanding that there's been many of people that have passed away in christ jesus since his crucifixion that have actually died physically and gone into grave but again that's not what he's talking about right you will not perish spiritually will be with me for eternity will have everlasting life eternal life that's that vision that's where that vision leads us to oh saints if that vision just doesn't stay in front of us day and night every moment of our lives that vision is there oh it's so easy sometimes we we we spend so much time and so much effort especially in this message i hate to say it but we spend so much time and effort on on looking at other people and the faults and the mistakes and the things they do or where we get so caught up in the vision of so many other that we just lose track of what we're supposed to be looking at hey we lose track of what our vision is supposed to be yes it's not supposed to be at my brother or sister whom the blood of jesus christ covers them as well but we get our vision so scrupled up sometimes we have so much effort in looking at other things instead of instead of the vision god gave us instead of the vision that he's telling us that we will not perish praise the lord that's the vision that god give us that we maintain for him all the time should not perish but have everlasting life thank god for that vision he keeps giving it to man he keeps giving it to us amen day after day that vision it doesn't fail it just keeps on going amen that vision that vision is of christ it's not of william branham amen amen it's not a voice of god no no it's not a church or a pastor right it's christ it's the same vision that william branham came and showed us to pointed us it's the same vision that john the baptist came and said there he is follow him amen it's that same vision the vision hasn't changed people have changed but he has not for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world look and how many times that seems like that's the attitude that people have god come for the purpose of condemning man they're sinners and should be judged as sinners amen what if god had come walking your pathway and you were sitting just like them would you want the same thing amen what if your loved one what if your family member or someone is sitting in that seat of the uh uh of unbelief are you going to sit in the seat of the scornful amen i tell you friend it's a bad spirit today that people have that that uh they don't seem to care unless it hits their doorstep right it doesn't matter all the stuff going on everything happening around the world around the country doesn't matter until it hits their doorstep and then all of a sudden there's a big uprising oh goodness we can't have this this can't be like this we shouldn't have to put up with this well where have you been this has been going on for a year two years five years whatever whatever the situation has been going on forever and they only care now because it's on their front door that's right that's the same vision people have today and a lot of times unfortunately christians think oh god just come just just condemn the world no he didn't jesus christ came to shed his blood to save the world to save all of humanity that should be our vision not on you're going and you're not and you're a sinner and you're going to hell and you're this and judging everybody just sending everybody know what our vision should be jesus even said in james that he by his will he would that all would repent and come to the glory of god amen amen he doesn't predestinate by his will but that's what his will was if that's what his will was and what should be our vision what should be our will our will should be the same thing we're too quick to put people in hell instead of lifting them into heaven we're too quick of putting people down instead of trying to lift them and edify them build them up help them amen be good to them let people see jesus through you amen let jesus let let people see jesus through you amen i believe that yes god didn't send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be safe thank god for that because i was a part of that amen thank you lord he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil excuse me are evil i should say for everyone that doth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth tr uh doth trust cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are uh raw in god the vision that god's giving us that our vision should always stay on our vision should always be in what we should be looking at is the vision that god's given us to to continue to press the vision the word the revelation that he has shown us and being a blessing to those that are around us amen look at this no wonder in the scripture now the woman with the blood issue no wonder the little woman could touch his garment and be healed by it and a drunken soldier could spit in jesus face and feel nothing at all the woman touched him and virtue left christ came into her so much virtue came out of christ it healed her of probably what we know today as cancer a blood issue she was healed but a soldier would come and spit in jesus face and felt nothing whatsoever take a read hit him in the head nothing at all strip his clothes down naked feel nothing at all so you see it depends on what the person's looking at one person was looking at a god as savior as as a as a healer the other was just looking at him as a malfactor as someone that deserved to die the worst death on a on a cross what was their vision see it's a reason one could do it one way and one could do it feel no no virtue at all depends on how you approach it depends on what you're looking for when you uh when you go to church it depends on what you're looking for amen again i'll go back to the title what is our vision what did we come in here looking for today i'll just say right now let's just make it personal with us right now what was our vision what was the purpose why what were we expecting we expecting to hear from god today yes amen then that's what you're going to get yes were you expecting just to come and have a nice social gathering and go home have something to eat go home that's what you're gonna get yes depends on what you're looking for what did you come for because what you come for is what you're gonna get amen if you come to hear if you come to see him if you come to hear from him if you come to have him move in your life and touch you and the spirit of god to move among this place and to change lives that's what's going to happen lord amen that's what's that's that's the vision if you expect that vision to come into your life into it and for it to change you you say well i've been born again i'm a believer i've been i've been a christian for 30 40 years so i've been preaching for 33 years so it doesn't matter from glory to glory he's changing me yes i want to continue to grow every day in the lord i want every day my life to reflect him more today than it did yesterday yes and more tomorrow yes i want my life to grow to a place that people can see jesus in me more now than they did yesterday next week i want to get on that plane this afternoon and go to my job and have everyone on my crew look at me in a different way yes you're different than you were two weeks ago well in what way i'd like you to explain it to me they probably couldn't but it'd be nice to hear i won't i want to be that much more closer to him can we change absolutely yes can we get closer to him absolutely can we become more like him absolutely that should be our vision our goal our pain amen let it be to us lord according to your word look at this man now st luke chapter 19. this is a very good story kind of made into in a lot of ways because of the song that was written about zacchaeus a little kids song but this is a very serious story this is a very serious situation that nicodemus uh was living through at this time uh zacchaeus excuse me not nicodemus zacchaeus was living through it this time it's uh luke 19 verse 1 luke 19 1. now we're getting into a contrasting vision from nicodemus now you got two men you got two very successful men you got two uh uh one's a businessman in the church and the other is just a businessman so they're both somewhat equally uh philanthropists uh entrepreneurs businessmen successful people of statute zacchaeus and nicodemus but look at the difference luke 19 1 and jesus entered and passed through jericho behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of statute and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way now the difference in nicodemus now and zacchaeus nicodemus came by night they both wanted to see him they both had something to say but nicodemus came by night zacchaeus came during the day in front of everybody zacchaeus was so determined because he was a short fellow that he climbed up in a tree just to make sure he got a vision of jesus he was that determined i like the story the way brother brown tells it he goes over and grabs his own nasty garbage can or something and moves it up next to the tree and man probably in a three-piece suit and rich man you know the hair and everything and everything perfect in line 400 pair of shoes and getting up into the sycamore tree just so he can get a vision of jesus you imagine man of the little chapter he ran before climbed up into the sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house amen now zacchaeus was so determined to see jesus that when jesus walked by he stopped at exactly the tree he was up in he looked up at him i mean how did he know he was there well because he was god and he looks up at him he says zacchaeus now how did he know his name because he's god and he says zacchaeus come down and make haste because i'm going to go eat with you today i'm going to go sup at your house how many of you would be receptive to that call well he does it all the time does he not right he wants to stuff with us all the time he always wants to be a part of our lives he always wants to come into our rooms our homes sister norm is saying the song about that room amen he always wants to come into that house he always wants to go into that room he always wants to be a part of our lives he always wants to sup with us praise the lord zacchaeus just had the corporate body of god jesus standing there telling i'm going to go eat with you today oh can you imagine now it's surprising zacchaeus didn't just fall out of the tree but he got out of the tree somehow and he made haste came down received him joyfully when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with the madness to see exactly what we were saying earlier so ready to condemn so ready to put down so ready to judge this man who they didn't even make an account to understand that jesus first knew he was up there second knew his name how is he to know that and then tell him i'm going to come and eat with you today they're already condemning him first thing my what was their vision they were probably there as critics anyway they were probably there trying to find something wrong with jesus to begin with you know what friend it's just like the way you came here today you're going to get what you come for they got exactly what they came for they were looking for something to condemn and when they saw jesus do this what was the first thing they did they condemned them for it right oh he's going to go eat with a uh with a sinner with a rich man that's probably robbed all kind of people wealthy man which most of them probably garnered a lot of the wealth that they had in their church from men like him oh my that's a whole other story but the first thing they did was condemn him look at the contrast of visions between zacchaeus and those men that were following jesus not his disciples of course but the men that were following along with jesus just like they went down to the river when john the baptist came out there and they said oh we're we're believers we're here to support you and help you and john the baptist said you're a snake in the grass right he said if you're here for sincere purposes you show me some fruits of your repentance amen that's the exact same thing they came they got what they came for they came to criticize they came to find something wrong and in their eyes they found it but it didn't matter because zacchaeus got what he came for too amen he got exactly what he came for his vision was to see christ he was going to do it at all it costs in all expense and he got to see him not only did he get to see him but jesus went to eat with him 8th first zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor there you go amen how can i love him without loving you right and if i have taken anything from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold amen we'll say he was a rich man yeah but he didn't have to do that in fact a lot of people say that same thing oh yeah but they're rich but you don't you ever notice that a lot of the worldly rich people the the richer they are the more they want yes they don't want to give it they want more giving they want to make more i i say when is enough enough in my opinion when is enough enough for us well sometimes it's not it never is for some people right so you say oh he's rich didn't matter most of the time rich people like him businessmen rich people like him they're not giving out money they're trying to get more and more money right they're not gonna they're not gonna have a dollar go down their bank account unless it's not some kind of an investment that's gonna earn them more money or a tax dodge or something that's the truth that's so that's what money does to people amen the love of money is the root of all evil right and and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he also is a son of abraham praise the lord for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost now contrast him as well with the rich young ruler think about the reach on brother he had the exact same opportunity the rich young ruler came to jesus purposely and called him good and jesus said why are you calling me good there's no good but god the rich young ruler had nothing but good things to say about him the rich young ruler wanted to see him he wanted salvation he even asked jesus he said how can i have eternal life how can i keep from john 3 16 happening to me where i perish and jesus said well you can do these you do these deeds you do these this works these things that you do and keep these commandments and rich young rulers all happy in his life in his heart he's thinking well i've done all those things since i was a youth i've kept all those commandments since i was a child i've got it made i'm a shoe-in to make it to heaven then jesus hit him where it hurt said then sell all you got give it to the poor he couldn't do that where's zacchaeus he said the half i have not not all but the half i have i give to the poor and if i've if i've uh uh cheated anybody i'll restore to them fourfold what i cheated from see the difference after that salvation was come to his house but after the rich young ruler he built more and more barns because he got more and more stuff he just got richer he just got more popular he just got more wealthy but you see at the end what happens to them right but you notice he got salvation where the rich young ruler did not right rich on ruler oh he loved his neighbor jesus told him love thy neighbors thyself oh i've done all these things well if you love your neighbors so much and sell all everything you've got and give it to them you say you love your neighbor so much then sell what you got and give it to them and take up your cross and follow me now he didn't love his neighbor quite as much as he confessed to did he because he couldn't do that he was a man of wealth and he wasn't willing to allow that well to go and look see how the different visions cause the different results zacchaeus and his vision and and the approach but what was one looking for one was looking for anything he had to do to get it he was going to and the other was just looking for a nice easy way to enter in without having to do a whole lot or give a whole lot or be anything there's a rich young ruler and it didn't matter because after that he got richer and richer and richer and that's what happens a lot of times to people when their vision what happens to their vision amen their vision changes our eyes should always stay on him i'm going to finish with this scripture i'm skipping a few things but amen uh revelation chapter 3 revelation chapter 3 we'll read a few verses of scripture here close just a minute revelation chapter 3 let's go to the 14th verse amen 14th verse praise the lord revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of course this is talking about the laodicean church age the laodicean church and of course the church age uh unto the church of the laodiceans right these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god who is that that's jesus right in the scripture you see that's jesus the beginning of the creation of god again speaking of himself that beginning of creation i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest listen now thou sayest who is it this layout to see an age because thou says that i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing knows not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked he said i counsel thee because it knoweth it not see knoweth it not thou art wretched miserable poor blind blind and naked willingly remember the scripture tells us willingly they for that are willingly ignorant of the truth willingly ignorant they are blind willingly amen blind poor blind naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raimen now that rich is not with the world's wealth and goods that rich is in the lord amen the goods of god the blessings of the lord in our lives that's the that's the riches that we obtain by being a christian by being a godly holy ghost-filled son or daughter of god the riches of god that thou maybe is rich not in the world's wealth but in the wealth of god with white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint amen anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see put on the eye sound because at this point and you know as well as i do as a person born in this world a human you're born a certain way you look at things a certain way yes when you get into the spiritual realm and going to church or something or whatever religion people may follow they look in a certain way they see by a vision and as this vision begins to develop in their lives it begins to develop naturally and humanity and in our humanity and our carnality we see certain things with our eyes natural but jesus says here you're poor and blind naked rich wretched miserable blind to buy i sat anoint thine eyes with isaf so that there's that point that a person comes to it that i hope trust believe we've all come to that point where that eye sab has been applied by the holy spirit to allow you to be able to see things differently not in a natural like nicodemus but like zacchaeus in the spiritual to see something that's beyond what you understand as a human that it's telling you that it's saying that that word begins to expound to you and that the vision of christ becomes so real that everything else begins to fade away everything else loses its luster everything else becomes a secondary thing matthew said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you what is first him what's the vision him that i self what does it do it'll change your vision it'll change your vision from a natural clouded vision of just the uh the normalities of life to that spiritual realm the spiritual life that that god wants to show us in himself in his word that zacchaeus saw that his disciples saw that god spoke of that that we see that solomon tells us that vision that points only to him that vision that drops the scales off our eyes so that we can see you say well how how can that be well you go back in the scripture and look go back to the very beginning and look in the garden of eden how did they receive a different vision than they originally had after the fall before the fall they had a specific certain vision did they not after the fall just like satan the serpent told you your eyes will be opened and you'll know good from evil you'll know bad for good and and you'll be as gods and all these and that did happen it was seen in a different way all of a sudden they realized they were naked and adam and eve clamored to find something to cover their nakedness and god comes down and begins to speak and now oh we got to get we got to hide we got to try to find some place to get away from him i i i i'm exposing myself like this but in his physical condition he was no different than he was before the fall he was just as naked before the fall as he was after he wasn't more naked after the fall his eyes just came open his vision changed he began to see things in a different way that he could not that that was veiled from him before he couldn't see it you think about the the tabernacle in the wilderness there were three veils in that tabernacle you go you look in the outside you can't see what's on the inside but if you go past that veil you can see what's on the inside but you can't see what's in the second realm you can only see what's out in the parlor the front room well if you go on the next one you say what you can see a whole different thing but you still don't know what's in the holies of holies right you still don't know what's behind that badger skin until you actually go behind it and nobody went behind there but the high priest and he had to do it exactly perfectly according to the scripture or he dropped as a dead man they had to put bells and pomegranates around the bottom of his garment so as long as they kept clanging and ringing they knew the man was okay but if he dropped dead and the bells quit ringing they they had a rope tied around his waist they didn't go in there and get him because they'd have dropped dead too they had a rope tied around his waist and when he went in there if he dropped dead they just pulled him out with the rope because they weren't about to go in there amen but his vision changed each time you say nothing can change all the circumstances be the same but you look at it in a different way it's a different vision it's a different vision what's our vision what is your vision today yes what are we looking at what captivates our attention not just physically physically too absolutely i know we're talking about the spiritual vision and that's the more important but i'm talking physical too what has gotten your attention what gets our vision what gets our attention what keeps us continuing to press i know there's a desire in the human to want to live i understand that but to live not just to live or to live not just to exist a lot of people just exist i'm talking about living what is it that causes that that keeps you pressing what keeps us with the understanding in our heart how close we are looking in a vision for a rapture for a body change for the lord return what is this is keeping that before us amen because we know that that vision stays there yes let's don't get our eyes on all the other stuff friends say amen keep our eyes focused only on him let our vision be him amen and let him lead us and show us whatever that purpose and reasoning that he's got we continue to press this battle toward the prize of the high calling in christ jesus amen praise the lord let's stand if we could jesus christ himself came exactly exactly like the bible said he would exactly like the jews taurus said that he would and when he got there what did they see what did they see even jesus when john sent his disciples to go talk to jesus jesus asked after he answered the question well just go tell him what you've seen go tell him what you've heard go tell him what you've witnessed in my life he'll know who i am yes but then he began to expound to the disciples and say what did you all come or to the the people around him what did you all come here for what did you come to see did you come to see your man in soft raiment did you come to see a reed shaken in the wind what would you come for what was the reason of your being here amen same question can be asked today what is our vision amen what is our vision today yes praise the lord blessing is uh listening is song i think it's song number eight oh i want to see him praise the lord amen as i journey through the land singing as [Music] but my lord leads me on
