TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all pleasing to him yes music no attitude in tune whatever that's all that matters amen praise the lord we want it to be glorifying and magnifying to him amen i have a couple things i wanted to mention to you but instead of leaving you standing for that we'll just read the scripture and then we'll let you be seated i have a couple testimonies i want to give to you report and all and uh i just got to the place there you know several of us missing today uh that aren't here with us for various reasons and we miss them all when you're not here if you're streaming we love you god bless you but we miss you when you're not here but uh um but it's just just the power surging through this place with those testimonies and sometimes it just takes a little personal touch like that to make a difference but um i thought we just turned it into a testimony meeting almost uh just feeling the power of god and the testimonies and the things that the lord is doing for us done for us you know it's not a strange thing for uh in in in reflecting on sister norman's testimony uh to be going down the road and the lord to show you something before it actually happens and then when it happens you're prepared for it because god prepared you man otherwise you could have been like one of those butterflies it's on your windshield uh that's just but that's the world but that's god's protection to us and watching over us amen just like my daughter my grandkids last week the other week and uh uh who is it old skate that test the uh brother danny with the car uh anyway i'm gonna start before i let you sit down uh but uh let's turn to first thessalonians chapter four again and we're on the rapture part 13. if you have some superstitions of some kind you might want to enable it 14 i don't so it doesn't bother me it's number 13. amen praise the lord first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we're going to begin reading amen before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could precious lord jesus father it's certainly a privilege to be here again we thank you so much lord for your spirit that's moving amongst us even now god and feeling that anointing and the power that's surging through this place right now god and lord hearing the testimonies and the things that you do for us done for us knowing god that those are just samples and those are just examples of things that you just continue to do for us all the time yeah and those are things that we recognize those are things that we acknowledge and and that we see that you've done for us lord if we can acknowledge and see those things how many things do you do for us every day that we don't even know about yes that we don't even recognize or or or or aren't cognizant of it lord god you're just so good to us and we love you so much there's just nothing like living for you father and we we thank you so much for all the wonderful attributes that you are to us and and the grace that you give to every one of our lives father lord none of us want your justice lord but if you weren't a just god how could we trust you but lord we can trust you today because you're just and because you're just you shine your grace and your mercy because you're a just god that mercy in our lives we thank you lord for this time of fellowship we thank you for this place that you've given us lord thank you for each one of those that have come those who may be streaming lord thank you for all that you've done and given and lord we just give you thanks and praise for it lord we pray god that you continue to bless the remaining part of this service yes we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to come and hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way god that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done here today may it be pleasing to you father and as lord we give you the glory for it we thank you god now and and offered up to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god the dead of christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you can be seated if you like for those of you who remembered uh i appreciate your prayers for us the minister's meeting that we had yesterday uh it was very much a success uh it was still a very good spirit this is the third one we've had here in arizona and it's been a real blessing and i thank the lord for blessing me had several people from the south so kind of made me feel a little more at home a few black brothers that came from south carolina and uh i enjoyed their testimonies and the spirit and the fellowship and um and it the theme of the the theme of it was the the message brother branham priest on the five true characteristics or identifications of the true church of the living god uh that brother brown preached i think it was september 11 11 1960 since it was september 11th yesterday that was kind of a theme that was chosen and uh and those characteristics and and it was beautiful to read uh to re-go over those characteristics through the couple of brothers that spoke the format is we get there and we have prayer and brother caleb says something brother steve uh robinson says something who kind of organized it uh a little bit and then we have an elderly minister he has like 45 minutes or so to speak a younger minister 45 minutes and they did a really good job uh but uh one of the focuses on that was the the church of miracles uh the one of the identifications of that true church is is miracles working in that church in that group of people and it reminded me because it was a brother there from south carolina named betty perry uh precious brother loving known him 30 years or more probably longer than that actually and uh and it and and when the brother mentioned that about that characteristic it made me think of a miracle that uh that brother benny had told us when we were at a fellowship meeting one time in north carolina i think we're actually in south carolina at that time at that meeting and he was telling us about and it had just happened so you know when a miracle takes place in something that's just outstanding you know what it does to you and how it affects your spirit and and how it makes you act and react and and then when you see that on the west coast or in arizona you can multiply that times about a hundred in in the south uh for whatever excitement we reach here in arizona you can you can take that excitement and multiply by times 100 in the south those people uh they get excited and his excitement his exuberance was in his face in his voice and he told the testimony of some sisters that was in his church it just happened like i said uh right as those meetings were going on uh there was a car load of them going down the highway uh 50 55 60 miles an hour whatever it was they had a head-on collision now yeah i don't need to tell you a 60-mile an hour head-on collision doesn't usually end up very well uh not a single person in the car was hurt not killed not hurt wow you understand i'm not saying no one was killed no one was hurt wow from this car in a 50 mile an hour head-on collision impact wow police showed up and he started to interview people somebody that was behind them saw the accident happen the police interviewed that person and that person said uh identified the crash and what happened afterwards so the police came to the to the sisters that was in the car and said uh and interviewed them and said okay where's this gentleman and they're like there was snowman they're like no ma'am there there's eyewitnesses that saw the crash happen and they saw a man get out of your car and help all of you out now where is he i want to know what happened to him i need to interview him and they said sir i'm sorry but there was no man in the car with us there was six of us and children where could we have put a man there was no man and they said we have eyewitnesses that they saw at just directly after the wreck a man get out of the car and help every one of you out now where is he gone not to be found now the test the testimony was told here this morning reminded me of that amen of that uh brother dennis and uh that entertaining angels unaware see you just never know saints amen what god's doing in it made me think of that i and other thing i was thinking uh one time some precious friends of ours in north carolina they made a turn to an intersection somebody blew through a red light and right at the point of impact that when they saw what was going to happen they screamed out jesus and the car went right through wow amen went right through them the car went right through them and they turned and kept on going now needless to say you can imagine all they felt after that happened uh but that's just the lord that's that's that's serving god and you say well you know i had a wreck it smashed me up and that didn't happen well it might be one in a million but it still happens yes amen you just trust the lord and that or whatever god does and one time jesus stepped over every single sick body at the pool of bethesda to go to one person and people would sit there and say well why didn't he heal all of them well that's not his predestinated will that's right whatever his predestinated will is that's what we want like what the angel was saying angel third was saying angel was saying he's either going to come home or go home yes praise the lord amen i mean what greater testimony can you have our selfish flesh you know if the lord does choose to take him which we're believing he's not if that's the lord's will then i believe they want it and if that's the lord's will then that's where we all want to go that's what we're all looking for aspiring to so uh that's just just uh that's just what we look to amen and thank god for amen you know i woke up yesterday and as uh probably most of the nation maybe some of you was reflecting on 9 11 20 years ago what happened maybe where you were when you first heard about 9 11 some of you weren't even born but 20 years ago when 9 11 happened i remember exactly where i was i was at the tabernacle we had just started tlc school and we were having a bible class and i was in the chapel upstairs with my bible in my hand when brother richard giberti came in and told us what had happened and didn't register at that at first but when i woke up yesterday i was reflecting on that it came on my heart now i'm going to say this i wanted to mention it to you i mentioned it to the group yesterday i told brother caleb i said i i woke up thinking this way and it came on my heart i said why don't we have a moment of prayer for the ones that have gone on there's there's something going on in the spirit realm saints there's something going on in the spirit realm the world will try to blame it on covet but it's not coveted right there's a lot of people that i know that have passed away that wasn't coveted just in the past couple of weeks just in the past couple of months going on in the spiritual i've never seen it like it is now people that are going on beyond the curtain of time that are passing on now in large numbers it's almost a daily event where you hear somebody that you know personally and may not have been a close friend or a relative but you know or know of that person personally on facebook or through uh people letting you know of the people that have been passing away it's been a lot i've never seen it like that before it used to be where you'd see one here or one there used to be a thing where people would say well they go in threes you ever heard that now they go in threes and two passed away and you're like well i wonder who the third one's going to be that kind of thing but this has been dozens dozens of people that have passed people i know people that and again not all coven maybe half of them may have been because of cobin but not all of them are it's just it's it's like we were talking about that vehicle whatever it is that god chooses if it's our time to go then uh actually if it's our time to go if you're a christian you should want to go i've said this before uh i believe if i have a lot of time here and and god has me and i'm being a purpose and god using me praise the lord but if that when that time ends i don't want to be here any longer than i need to be i just soon go i love my family i love my grandchildren my children i love you i love the church uh but whatever god's done with me it's like brother branham said i read that quote last week i don't want to come to that door as a coward right amen that door is there for a purpose and that door is there to relieve us of this past house amen but but i say that because i believe there's something very significant going on in in the spirit realm uh i don't think it's a coincidence of a lot of things that i see happening naturally amongst the bride and amongst churches and people that i know i don't think it's an accident the lord put this on my heart to bring about the rapture and there's something that there's just uh if we could just break into that channel and and the lord would uh of course we knew everything was god was doing every time he did it there would be no need for faith right but i i just want to let you know i believe in my in my spirit and what i see it there's something significant happening in the world today amen very significant spiritually significant i'm not talking about just at the afghanistan thing and and 9 11 just happened the 20-year anniversary i'm talking about the spirit realm just there's very significant things that are happening in the spirit realm right now that we need to be very cognizant of yes pray continue to try to keep yourself before the lord the best you can read your bible pray stay in contact keep that relationship that you got with jesus strong let that relationship be stronger than ever right now i read brother dennis gave that too it's just uh it is so very true friend uh and i and i believe that if you're listening to me and if you listen in the future whatever it is there's just i believe it's that time to buckle and cinch that girder up that much tighter now uh something's going on amen i'm anxious to see what the lord does next amen praise the lord so we're just going to trust him in that so when we when we end the service uh i want us to get together and pray and i want to pray for those who have gone i want us together hold hands if we will maybe pray for brother angel jr and um and and if you're streaming and if you want to do that at home or if you're somebody there or just bind your spirit with us uh however it may work i want to do that we'll do that lord willing afterwards amen so uh i appreciate that and what god is doing for us amen praise the lord i hope i hope all these testimonies and things like that is not lost on us no amen don't let it be lost on us saints it's god god is mindful yes god loves you amen praise the lord there's been there's been people i know that have died tragically there's been saints of god that i've known that died in traffic accidents you go why did they die and god shows sister norma to back up or brother danny to swerve or go through those people i don't know but that's the sovereignty of god that's the trust we have in him that he protects us and keeps us and whatever he sees down the road is his perfect will that's what we want to do now let's uh let's move forward in the rapture part 13. uh we talked quite extensively and we probably could continue to talk more about the the resulting condition and what this world is supposed to be like at the time of rapture jesus was very specific about it we went through two or three uh services of that and no doubt with all the things that's still going on around us and all the signs and all the uh things that we can actually see with our eyes just just natural things that are happening and we can identify them in the scripture uh i felt to to to move on from that part and i want to talk today about uh those that go in the rapture and the scriptural precedent that is given to us of those that go in the rapture now we know and again saints a lot of what i give you know i'm not some deep uh i don't know called revelated maybe uh a scholar or something that i i just try to bring what the lord puts on my heart and maybe it's simple stuff maybe it's something you know but whatever it is the lord has somebody wants to hear it right amen and maybe that's me and if it is that's fine too so bear with me if you will but uh but i want to talk about the fact that the only ones that go in this rapture are the predestinated gentile bride that's the only ones that this rapture is for and there's lots of people on the earth there's a lot there's there's a jew and gentile but this rapture we're talking about is only going to be for the predestinated gentile bride now i say predestinated because so many times our vision gets narrowed and understandably but it gets narrowed to the point that we see what's in front of us and what's going on and what's happening right now so many times it seems like our verbiage makes it toward the raptures only for those that are alive and we and sometimes we displace those people that have gone on before the people that have gone from the very first church age to this church age peter paul john i mean all the uh the reformers down through the ages and all those that gave their lives to the martyrdom and and the dark ages and all they're all a part of that same rapture saint so but the only way to be in it is to be a predestinated seed now we know that in this last day and of course if you die in christ before that rapture the the key to that the the the ticket that you need to have is the token right but there is also the the uh the discussion that people have and sometimes forget that the fact that there are people who die before they get to the age of accountability now what happens to those people what happens to the children if they die before the age of accountability now brother adam says they go and they're going to be in heaven right they will be in heaven we know that because they didn't reach that age now we mourn and grieve and we're very sorrowful at the at the loss of a young child when they're killed or whatever it is but there's one thing you can know that child is going to be in heaven praise the lord i don't care who they are where they came from right the thing of it is now though do they go in the rapture does every one of them they're going to be in heaven brother and so they're going to be in heaven everyone if they before they get the age of accountability to the place that they can receive the holy spirit are they going to be in the rapture as well yes they passed on amen they've gone on uh and they will be in heaven but that but will they be in the rapture or will they be a part of the group that still uh uh is in the grave for the thousand years through the millennium and come up in the second resurrection the so that prompted this word i put in here and that is the predestinated gentile bribe brother madam says because the question was asked him and questions and answers do do children are there going to be children in the rapture or will there be children that go in a rapture people children that die beforehand will they be in the rapture and he says it depends on whether they are predestinated of god or not they will be in heaven amen but that does not mean that they will be in a rapture only the predestinated of god go in a rapture amen only the predestinated of god going to rapture so only the predestinated gentile bride from the first church ace till today are going in this rapture right only the predestinated so even if they die beforehand even if they were children even if they were so young they did weren't able to get the holy spirit they'll only be in the rapture if they are predestined of god amen and that's just the thoughts of god right the predestination of god is just the attribute the thought of god if you are the elected and the predestined in god's mind is a thought of god an attribute of god before the foundation of the world that predestination lies with you if not it does not right that does not mean now that if you weren't predestined or in the thought in god's mind that does not mean you're going to hell you might but it's not a hard and fast see that's where the separation that god has between the sheep and the goats right amen but there's the bride that is his bride but there are those who are granted eternal life amen they're given eternal life and that group will be there yes they'll be outside the city i'm kind of getting ahead of myself but they'll be outside the city the new city as workers they won't be in the new city they won't be inside the walled city they'll be outside but they'll be granted eternal life they'll be given life that's a group of people that are that that maybe were saved but weren't filled with the holy spirit maybe they remained virtuous but they didn't have the holy ghost maybe they reached a place of adulthood and they they died outside of of of the whole of being born again yes but they still might make uh they won't make a rapture but they still might make heaven amen so that being said let's go to matthew chapter 25 now and we'll talk about the ten virgins did you get that mica oh it's been a big steal praise the lord matthew chapter 25. i also like to say we we had a wonderful time last sunday night me and brother john went down to we didn't go together but we ended up there to brother rogers church down in sierra vista and we had a really good time in the lord last sunday sunday sunday afternoon it was a very good spirit we had communion foot washing afterwards i believe the lord really blessed the service the song service was outstanding and the spirit was moving and it was a it was a nice sweet spirit last sunday night so i enjoyed that i really appreciate brother roger inviting us to come down i want to have communion here too uh hopefully in the next couple of weeks uh brother neil no noel johnson's supposed to be here october 3rd sunday and i'm thinking of wanting to try to have it before then so hopefully before october 3rd but i haven't uh i haven't set a date yet it won't be next sunday probably the sunday after actually now i think about it it'll probably be the sunday after next two weeks from today lord willing we'll have communion for watching but we had a really good time with the lord last sunday night god really blessed it so thankful for that matthew chapter 25 now uh how many times this uh parable god jesus gives is used um so many times but as it refers to the end time and and beyond even it's a very good reference of scripture then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom now again as we've said before in pat times past we got to recognize and acknowledge all ten of them were virtuous okay all ten of the number of virtues they were undefiled by man by man's ideas doctrines opinions dogmas they were virtuous to the lord amen virtuous to the lord and five of them were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept so we've only got one variance between the wise and the full foolish virgin at this point and that is that the wise had oil in their vessels and the foolish did not right they did not have oil in their vessels they did not take any extra oil but uh but the wise did so that's the only variance at this point and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him i believe an end time message did that for us correct amen as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so will your message four run the second praise the lord amen amen so we know that we know that cry has been made behold the bridegroom coming go ye out to meet him that's i believe that's what we're doing now that's what the bride is doing how is she doing it through the word right amen that's spirit then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps so this is still no variance they all rose and they all trimmed their lamps all of them were slumbering and sleeping but all of them rose and they all trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out so now obviously the wat the foolish virgin had oil but they did they only had it in their lamps they didn't have it in their vessels so when their experience burned out when their anointing went away when they're uh tingling their flesh or their little uh gift of expression speaking in tongues or whatever when that was all gone what did they have the wise still had oil in their vessels the foolish did not because that's all they had they jump they dance they shout they praise the lord they spoke in tongues they did all the things that the wise virgins did but they did not they weren't born again right they did not have oil in their vessels we know oil represents the holy ghost they did not have oil in their vessels they only had it in their lamps what is the lamp a lamp is the outward uh expression of light that comes forth that's what a lamp does a vessel is a storage place for the oil which to me i type that as the soul right the soul of man is that storage place that stores that uh that oil the holy spirit so that it works itself outward so that the lamp that shines forth to the world shines forth of god through your lamp right it's done through the oil well the anointing will do the same thing but it'll only do it for a short period of time right an anointing will come on you an anointing will cause you to to share a gift it'll cause it to be operated it'll cost you to cause you to have some kind of experience tingling in the flesh or weeping and crying coming to an altar and all those things are expressions of an anointing but a life lived is the only expression of oil in your vessel 24 7 365 366 leap year it shows that there is uh that there is oil in the vessel when a life is lived yes that's where the difference comes amen the devil can jump and shout the devil can speak in tongues the devil can manifest any kind of a gift brother brown said he could but he cannot bring that word or live that word word by word can't do it why because that's the oil that's the born-again experience that causes the individual to live a godly christian holy ghost-filled life there's the difference so when their oil went out now the difference now these people there's they were still virtuous okay now there's others that they may experience that anointing and they're not virtuous they've sold themselves out into denominations and they they prostitute themselves to uh uh to doctrines and dogmas of man of this world and and they are in no way virtuous to god right in no way are they but there is a group of people that will remain virtuous and yet still not be born again right remember the spirit would be so close it would deceive the very elect the very predestinated if possible that's the only closeness of spirit that there is you look at the world and you see the catholic church denominations you even see the nominal christian the charismatics and you see them out on the street they look absolutely nothing like a biblical christian right nothing they don't look anything or express themselves in any way like the godly christian does in their dress in their talk in the places they go the things they watch the music they listen to in no way do they express themselves in a way that would make you believe that they have the holy spirit because there's nothing biblical about their lives right if there's nothing biblical about their lives or what they watch or what they listen to their music or how they dress then then you can't believe that that person they only received an anointing of some kind they only received a spirit that came on them and that's all they had but now that person still remains virtuous to god now there's debate are the is this group of people in the message or is this group of people not in the message i've heard debate both sides brother branham said to be people come out of those denominations but look friend that was 60 years ago if there's going to be a coming out there's already been a coming out is there one or two or whatever still may be there i don't know that's up to the lord could be there could be some still in denominations uh but i but i've had people give arguments on both sides i believe it could be both but i i i believe it's very difficult for a person to remain in a denomination and not prostitute themselves to the hybridism of the dogma from that denomination right yes very difficult now a person can be in the message and receive the truth of the message and still not be born again right they live on that experience they sit next to us in pews and uh and in different churches and and special meetings and things maybe even a minister or two i don't know but they don't defile themselves with the dogma of satan and the world and the hybridism of the word they stay pure to the word they just didn't get born again yes see and and there's the difference there's the separating point because the predestinated of god receive that spirit and become born again they have an experience that transcends beyond just an anointing that affects their lives in every day that they live and everything they do and everywhere they go their influences like i said last week is living in a different dimension you look at everything differently because you live in a different place right the ungodly music that you hear out of this world today has no interest to you because you're a different creature yeah it doesn't even appeal to you because you're not that you you don't live in that dimension you don't live to feed off the things of satan in the world right you that that's not your that's not your absolute that's not what you live on when you become born again you become someone that's gone beyond those the things of the world and you have no appetite for that anymore right there's not even a desire there's not even an appetite for it that's why a born-again son or daughter of god cannot sin because there's no longer an appetite you'll make a mistake slip up and do things you shouldn't or say something you shouldn't get a little anger or something whatever it is but you're not thirsty for that you're not right you're you're your spirit your soul is not um dictating to you to to be that kind of person anymore your your spirit your soul the the life that's in you calls you to to be a word body yes to be a godly holy ghost christian that's what it calls you to be the separation between these two the the line seems very fine but the difference in the two is the difference between going in a rapture and being here through the tribulation now again i speak that as an alive and remain group correct because only the alive and remain that fit the foolish virgin category is going to go through the tribulation because the others have already gone on they've passed on already so those will go through the tribulation period they'll have to steal their testimony with their own blood right but they'll be there they won't be in a rapture the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years while the bride is in the millennium the wedding supper in the millennium they won't be there they'll come up in the second resurrection but be granted life right you read on the rest of uh uh of chapter 25 down at the bottom it talks about that he goes into the parable of the talents and then he goes into the parable of the separating in the 21st verse of the separating of the sheeps and the gods amen scofield says that's not the white throne judgment but i beg to differ with him and i believe brother brown did too uh and he talked about this isn't here this isn't present present but there's there's there's never a time where all of humanity comes to one place at one time except the white throne judgment that's the only place a scholar like uh like dr scofield would be and not recognize that everybody according to this scripture is gathered before the throne of god and that's what it says he said as he sits upon the throne of his glory and all of the nations come and gather before him well there's no other place scripturally there's no other place that is to happen but the white throne judgment right so it's so it's got to be so the parable that jesus gives now is then as the bride as christ and the bride are judging the world each one of them comes up one at a time there's a judgment that takes place and there's a separation the sheep from the goats right now the goats at that time that the the the the goat represents the unbeliever if you will that's it's a a metaphor the goat it is just the unbeliever that goes into hell they get cast out into outer darkness but the sheep are granted eternal life right and then of course jesus gives the parable there where he says uh you fed me you clothed me and when you did it to the least of these my little ones no you weren't born again but you were you were good to them you you helped them and you were there for them uh but you you know you you didn't get the holy ghost but i grant you life because you took care of mine amen and so there will be those people that are there now in scripture and of course the type that brother branham gives mostly is uh zenoch and noah a lot of times people talk about noah as the end time or the end time bride but noah did not represent the end time bribe right noah did not represent the predestinated gentile bride of this last day or well let's say last day from these church ages they go on a rapture uh he was a man that typed the uh the uh the foolish virgin yeah enoch was the man that typed the wise virgin so enoch was the wise virgin noah was the foolish virgin because enoch raptured one man before judgment ever struck the earth one man went into rapture was caught away did not taste death there was one man that's right they say eight souls were saved in the flood absolutely but only one man went in the rapture mine does that mean that the type of that and the numbers is going to be the bride and and then the the the the foolish version those that go into the tribulation will be eight times as many i don't know brother brown talk did numerology a lot we don't know uh he preached one in a million i know i know brother brown did that but there was only one winning rapture only one person that whole time went to rapture eight went over the tribulation yes they came on the other side yes they were saved from the judgment of that day but you notice how noah when he come out on the other side became a drunk at relation with his daughter in birth moab which was evil wicked and died to death noah did but enoch raptured yes enoch made it out before any of the judgment ever struck yes that's the type i'm looking for saints that's the place i want to get i know a lot of people say well if i don't go on a rapture then i just hope i'm a foolish virgin my my mind you have no revelation of what a foolish virgin's going to have to deal with when the tribulation gets are you right yes none that's right oh my god i don't want to be if i felt like that that was ever an option in my life i would find an altar somewhere i'd find a place where i could meet god somewhere wherever it was and i'd be on my face till i knew that that that i wasn't a part of that group amen amen oh my what is it going to be like people are scared of death coven can you imagine what they're going to do when the tribulation hits right and they're scared over a little germ why ain't nothing eyes not seen here's not heard what's about to strike this earth and it probably john did the best he could right and what was shown to him but how could you really pin what's going to happen how could you put it in words to where it would be descriptive enough to understand but i want you to see this enoch and noah both of course who were acknowledged uh in genesis but were acknowledged in in uh in hebrews amen and in the new testament of course uh jesus talked about the these days right here being as the days of noah and maybe we might expound on that lord willing uh if if he'll allow us some point but jesus even said as it was in the days of noah right so we know there's a significance to that so let's look see uh enoch and noah in genesis chapter 5 verse 24 there's one very genesis 5 24 there's one very distinctive characteristic that both of these men had even though one of them went in the rapture and one of them went through the tribulation there's one very distinctive unique characteristic about both of these men amen just very much like the ten virgins we just read right uh it it it was striking and i've seen this and i've preached on it before but when i was looking at it more this week and yesterday it really struck me as to really how how close this is and how uh similar the types are but now genesis chapter 5 we read it last week with enoch genesis 5 24 and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him now what is the very most distinctive characteristic about that verse enoch walked with god that's the very most distinctive characteristic about that scripture is that enoch walked with god amen that that is uh that was one of the things we talked about last week before the rapture what was it like what was enoch like before the rapture well he the bible says he walked with god amen hebrews says he had a testimony that he pleased god well how did he please god because he was walking with him right amen he walked with him talked with him was pleasing to him but the the characteristic in genesis he walked with god now once you understand in the andaluvian world there's only two men that this ever describes actually in the scripture that these two men that that it's described exactly this way the other one is genesis chapter 6 verse 8 and 9. genesis 6 8-9 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah did what walked with god now obviously there's other characteristics about noah that weren't mentioned about enoch like he was perfect and a just man in his generations but the outstanding thing was noah walked with god just like enoch walked with god amen the five foolish were virgins and the five wise were virgins they all walked with god but one group go in the rapture and the other group did it amen amen when the when the foolish virgin went to go get the oil the bridegroom came and god took them in a rapture and the foolish virgins well what's happened what's going on now look we know it's going to be a secret catching away it's going to be quiet secret the world won't know but if there's any group of people that will know when the rapture takes place it's going to be the foolish virgin because if she's in this message and she comes to church on sunday morning and half the church is gone including maybe the pastor and i say maybe what do you think they're gonna think what's gonna cross their mind when they say where did so and so go i don't know they're not answering my call they're not answering my texts i don't know they always call me back they always text me back they always show up for work and all of a sudden they're gone the only group that may understand that may know now the world may say well they're gone and you know we don't know what happened to them where they went maybe they ran away changed their identity in the world like we said the past two or three sundays the world makes up all kind of excuses for the things that god is doing in this world i told you one of the biggest ones climate change that's one of the big excuses they use for what god's doing in this world today but man is always trying to make excuses but if there's ever a group that's going to know what happened to that group it's going to be the foolish virgin now to be a secret catching way don't get me wrong i know that but if anybody's going to know what happened when it happened it's going to be the foolish virgin they're going to come up and say these people are gone my pastor's gone uh the the the brother i usually set to next to in church is gone and all these people aren't showing up and and and they're always there and they're gone what happened they'll know those people will know i believe they will anyway right enoch so so when the bridegroom came back and they said they said let us in let us in you know what let me go back to that um you can turn back if you'd like to we know the story but there's one other point i wanted to bring out about it and i wanted to do it by reading it i didn't just want to give it to you because it's i know it but read it to you the foolish eighth verse the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out the wise answers saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut the door was shut who shut the door do you think the wise virgins shut the door well certainly the foolish virgins didn't shut the door because there and when did he close the door he closed the door after the bride was separated from from judgment from this world right when else did god shut a door in enoch or with noah noah went in the ark the bible says god shut them in god shut the door so god shut the door then when did he shut the door he shut the door on the believer and the unbeliever the believer couldn't get out you believe unbeliever couldn't get in so god shut the door there god shut the door here god's the one that does the door shutting not man right right amen and nor would i want to amen but a just god and his righteous uh and we'll say even anger here shuts that door and there's nobody else getting in you can plead you can scream you can cry you can beg but there will that door will not come open it won't come open on the ark and it won't come open when god shuts it here and they screamed and yelled we did this we did this and he said depart i don't even know you now i brought this out before but i felt it very important to do again there's a couple of places that jesus in his parable says that i know ye not one of them is if you find in the greek one of them now they're translated to the same verbiage in english but one of them refers to jesus saying i never knew you as in i never had relations with you i never you were never a part of me i was never a part of you i i have no acknowledgement of you uh you were never in my thoughts you were never in my mind we never had relations with one another i did not know you and this i knew you not is i'm ignoring you it's a different word when jesus here says i know you not to the foolish virgin it's i'm ignoring you i'm not listening to you now you had your chance amen and and you'll have to go through this period you'll have to go uh wait through the through the millennium and and and be asleep for the thousand years uh to come up in the second resurrection i'm grossly paraphrasing them obviously but that's that's basically the gist of it but i'm ignoring you right now you had your chance you had the opportunity and you didn't do it i offered you over and over again the opportunity and the chance to receive my spirit into yourself and it and it didn't you did so i'm ignoring you now and that's that's what that that i know you not not that god never had them or or or was relation because see later in the 25th verse he actually grants them life or 25th chapter he actually grants them life but at that time that's not the time for it that time's the time of a rapture and only the predestinated gentile bride of god goes in that rapture amen the foolish tribulation period i don't know you so all of them virtuous enoch and noah both walked with god they both had the testimony that they walked with god they had that testimony but one went in a rapture and the other went through the tribulation like i said had relations with his daughter became a drunk ended up birthing moab and died to death amen type of the tribulation now and and the door was shut right at that time prophecy of jesus isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive brother brown says 800 years wasn't 800 years it was 700 and some odd years was negan was he rounding up i don't know i don't bring you anything that i don't know that the lord's revealed to me or i can find the scripture in the message i don't i just don't do it now i've had different people tell me different things and and uh and i've had people tell me like this is the way it happened you know i'm sorry brother but where is your where is your authority on that i i because if it doesn't come from the scripture that's the third that's the authority and of course the the derivative of the scriptures the message we have you can't find it i you know i don't know what your authority is to tell me this is exactly how it happened um i i'm sorry i can't go with you there you may be right and that's fine if you are that's great but the good part isn't to have anything to do with my salvation but just telling you that's what brother branham said if you get those conflicts of those things this is another one brother brahm said and this is still on the first seal he said what was it like enoch you know noah watched enoch for when enoch come up missing he no judgment was at hand he got to hanging around the ark but noah didn't go up he just lifted a little piece rode over the tribulation carried through the tribulation died of the dead enoch was translated without death the type of the church being caught up uh with those which are asleep to meet the lord in the air the rest of the church carried through the tribulation period now brother pat made us this of course you could look in the scripture because that's where brother pat got it from this uh chart if you've gotten it looked at it there's still more over there if you don't have one you can clearly see obviously that enoch was not alive when the flood took place but i want to bring you something interesting because i i've actually had people tell me about that too and i don't know if it's true or not and i and and and and i don't know i'm not bringing this as doctrine to you i'm just giving this is something that maybe you can chew on and you can decide for yourself but enoch had methuselah we know that scripturally methuselah was issued from enoch's lineage he was he was his son enoch named methuselah obviously as his son well if you look at methuselah now there's a couple places you have to find it but it's spelled differently methuselah spelled two or three different ways scripturally and in the greek lexicon spelled two or three different ways so you have to find but this is m-a-t-h math o-u-s-a-o-u-s-a-l-a methuselah that methuselah means when he dies there shall be an emission or a sending forth of waters upon the earth that is the definition of this methuselah in a th o that's right that's the definition of that that methuselah's name enoch named methuselah methuselah the definition of the name on the meaning of the name is when he dies there shall be an admission come forth or ascending forth of waters upon the earth which would be outstanding considering the fact that it had never rained on the earth before then why would enoch have named methuselah methuselah that then unless he knew by being walking with god maybe on one of his walks with god god said you know you know i'm going to do this this and this and so enoch named methuselah methuselah so when methuselah dies there's going to be an emission well you know when methuselah died the exact same year that the blood came amen it was pretty easy for me to find because like i said brother pat put it in this chart that you can see methuselah died right before the flood came amen now people smarter than me or have more time to study it out than me can look at the exact dates month day time whatever uh that's not necessarily significant to me the fact of the matter is methuselah died right before the flood noah named methuselah methuselah knowing that that was the meaning of his name that when he dies there'll be a flooding of water coming on the earth now is that what brother branham was referencing or is that what the holy spirit was speaking through brother branham to reference i don't know right i don't know but i find it quite quite outstanding that that those two things match together right i mean surely we you know as christians we don't believe in coincidence anyway but surely that's not a coincidence that enoch would name his son of methuselah amen knowing that that's what it meant and he died at the exact same time the flood came but nevertheless the fact is that when brother branham said that he walked with god he walked with god and and then he was not because god took him very well enoch went in the rapture the wise virgin noah went through the tribulation as the foolish virgin now this this i'm going to close here no good teacher got in god hiding and revealing himself in simplicity now this is the albuquerque one so this is after the seals not the one before the breach god hiding himself in simplicity no good teacher and this was in albuquerque no good teacher believes that the church the bride he said the church goes through the tribulation you notice when brother branham started when the holy spirit started to reveal to brother branham the distinction between the church and the bride the calling out of the bride from the church he started fluctuating back and forth especially when he was in mixed company uh he did it at home too but when he was out visiting other churches um you know you get so used to saying something one way even when something comes to you and you you know it's different it's hard to change from that so when you mention it then uh then it's like calling uh it's like it took me forever to make sure and called joel joel instead of micah because i mean for 31 years he's been our son we call it my cuts on a boy comes in hey my guys no it's joel you know you get so used to saying something one way you know it just it just happens that way and that's what brother brown did and many times he would do that sometimes he corrected sometimes he didn't but he's correcting it here he said now the church goes to the tribulation but not the bride the church goes through the tribulation for purification sure under the sixth seal which which baffles the thought of people who believe the bride is going through the tribulation period because the point of the tribulation period is a purging time the sixth seal the the tribulation is a time of purging and purifying well why does the bride of christ need to be purified when the blood of jesus christ has already purified her she's been found not guilty and god has put his own life in her right right then why does she need to go through purification for blood of jesus christ has purified her amen amen she's as pure and white as as as god has washed her in his own blood right amen so if the sick seal is that purging period the bride doesn't need purging she's him right she's become him there's no purging for her to go through but the church does the foolish virgin does because they did not receive that oil they they need to go they have that time of need to go through that purification that uh that purging period amen brother venom also includes again i'm closing another group in this he said the bride goes through the purification the church goes through for purification under the sixth seal right he said israel does the same thing for the hundred and forty four thousand the church so the the church the the foolish virgin and the hundred and forty four thousand go through the tribulation for a purification process purging but the bride does not go through that time she's at the marriage supper of the lamb amen proving once again that this rapture is only for the predestinated gentile bride amen she goes the bride is forgiven she goes straight into glory in a rapture that's right see my opinion the last member will be will be caught up one of these days it might come and you would never know anything about it remember it's a secret secret catching away he'll come in an hour that you think not and that's the period of time that we're living right now amen amen that's the period of time that we're living right now i believe that uh there's people that are going on again that i mentioned that are that are passing away by large numbers large numbers people i i personally know even friends of mine uh that i know from back east and from from california to north carolina uh passing away right but they're and then i don't know why i i don't know that i'll ever know why i don't know if i need to know why but i do know there's there there must be all these believers leaving must be a reason spiritually something happening in the spirit realm we see all the things that's going on around us and we can recognize what's happening see amen we know the bride the bride is she's become him she's she's in she's in his coffers she's the she's perfect she's bird she's the bride sinless but all the other thing that goes on around her that has it has an effect you can feel it and when you and when a loved one goes on or or a good friend or something it you feel it you're happy for them but you miss them you know because it's a it's a part of the flesh the bible says that there is a time to mourn amen and we mourn and then we thank god for their life and that they're with him and we move on right amen praise the lord the the the the morning period comes when there's a time to celebrate them you know the bible says that we should uh the bible says that we should cry when they're born and celebrate when they die we'd as humans and our selfish flesh we do just the opposite amen but understand again this this rapture that we're talking about even from the dead in christ that rise is only for the predestinated elected chosen gentile bride of jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord and we see that identified to us very plainly i think in the scripture that tells us that amen let's stand if we could amen i don't know why they keep sending me texts i get texts i'm preaching and people sending me texts i'm going to look at my phone when i'm preaching or even in church sometimes but uh praise the lord i'm thankful the stream has started working so amen appreciate the micah's efforts sometimes uh human machines and mechanical devices and man-made things just don't always go the way you want them to or think they should sometimes they don't work probably right but thank god that we have them so i'm looking into getting some new equipment too uh a new camera to hang up over there for streaming so we'll see if it's something that looks like it's going to work out then we might do that and so we'll have an actual camera and a microphone and things like that and how many of you enjoy brother john's song leading yeah i've enjoyed it and brother zach on the guitar and it's like that talent in matthew 25. amen god gave one five gave one five talent and he made five talents for his five talent and he said well done good and faithful servant but the one who buried his talent and hid it in the ground god cast him into outer darkness amen so i praise the lord that we have people that are willing to lead songs and play the piano and guitar and whatever else and if you got one let me know sing or play or amen just give it to the lord amen for his glory and honor amen that's what matters the most we do it all for him yes just to worship and praise him yes praise the lord amen you love him today amen amen god is so good to us isn't he amen let's sing this course number 360 amen before we go today song number 360. greater is he that's in me than he this in this world praise the lord [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] seeking him he may devour [Applause] but god has promised us [Applause] is [Applause] is [Music] amen praise the lord amen so thankful greater is he that's in us amen yes praise the lord jesus so thankful for that amen we have something that we can stand beyond this world that we live in amen recognizes something greater in us amen amen living in us praise the lord living through us amen that identifies to the rest of the world amen who we are yes amen thank you jesus
