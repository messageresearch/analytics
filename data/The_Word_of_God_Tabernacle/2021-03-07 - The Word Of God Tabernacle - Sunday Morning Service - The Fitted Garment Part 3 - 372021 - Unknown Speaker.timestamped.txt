[12:30] sister sharaya asked prayer for her and
[12:34] her family

[12:46] sister sheila also mentioned that

[12:53] sick i guess
[12:54] um let me see what it was food poisoning

[13:00] vomiting and very weak and a fever so
[13:03] he's doing a little better today

[14:13] has a couple other ones as well uh for
[14:15] his
[14:16] family members um for his mother-in-law
[14:19] just that she would

[37:45] amen exodus chapter 28 we'll read the
[37:48] first four verses here
[37:51] and take thou unto thee aaron thy
[37:54] brother and his sons with him from among
[37:56] the children of israel that he may
[37:57] minister unto me in the priest's office
[38:00] even aaron nadab abide
[38:03] elazar ithamar aaron's sons
[38:06] and thou shalt make holy garments for
[38:09] aaron thy brother for glory and for
[38:11] beauty
[38:12] and thou shalt speak unto all that are
[38:14] wise hearted
[38:15] whom i have filled with the spirit of
[38:17] wisdom that they may make aaron's
[38:19] garments to consecrate him
[38:21] that he may minister unto me in the
[38:23] priest's office
[38:24] and these are the garments which they
[38:26] shall make a breastplate
[38:28] and an ephod and a robe an abroaded coat
[38:32] a miter and a girdle and they shall make
[38:35] holy garments for aaron thy brother and
[38:37] his sons
[38:38] that he may minister unto me in the
[38:41] priest's office
[38:42] you could be seated if you like amen i
[38:46] want to uh
[38:47] i wasn't sure after last week uh what
[38:50] maybe the lord would
[38:51] have for today but uh i wanted to just
[38:54] continue on the thought that we've had
[38:55] the past couple of sundays that'd be all
[38:57] right
[38:58] uh on the fitted garment and so the lord
[39:01] really this would be the fitted garment
[39:02] part
[39:03] three and uh probably be the last part
[39:05] of this
[39:06] uh but felt like this would be something
[39:08] that would be edifying and a blessing to
[39:10] to his children today and felt led to do
[39:13] it so
[39:14] we'll just continue on out we went
[39:16] through of course elijah elijah the
[39:18] mantle of prophet
[39:19] we've talked about extensively about the
[39:21] wedding garment the bride garment the
[39:23] word garment
[39:24] uh for this last day and how this bride
[39:26] is to be clothed in that garment
[39:28] and for that garment to make a
[39:31] make a consecration of her because of
[39:33] the word
[39:34] the consecration of the word and the
[39:36] word in her life and her becoming the
[39:38] word
[39:38] clothed in the word becomes a
[39:40] consecrated individual
[39:42] in themselves uh it goes back and think
[39:44] about the type and there's many of them
[39:46] through the scripture
[39:47] and there's many references to garments
[39:50] in the scripture
[39:51] uh there's very specific detailed
[39:54] uh garments through the bible if you if
[39:56] you look through the bible which i'm
[39:57] sure most of us have read all through it
[39:59] or
[40:00] most of it you notice that maybe and
[40:02] maybe you haven't noticed that
[40:04] garments actually play a very particular
[40:07] and large part
[40:08] of the bible in god's mind a lot of
[40:11] people think in the world today that it
[40:12] does god doesn't care what you wear
[40:15] well yes he does he's very specific
[40:17] about it too
[40:18] he's very specific as you could read
[40:21] here
[40:22] if god didn't care what we wore he would
[40:24] have left adam and eve alone
[40:26] when adam and eve clothed themselves
[40:28] with fig leaves
[40:30] they were clothed from the nakedness
[40:32] that they found themselves in when they
[40:33] fell into sin
[40:34] and that was appropriate enough in the
[40:36] sight of god god would have just left
[40:38] him alone
[40:39] if god wasn't particular about what you
[40:41] wear what the garments we have on our he
[40:43] would have just left them alone not done
[40:45] anything for them
[40:46] but that wasn't sufficient that wasn't
[40:48] what was pleasing to the lord
[40:50] so god made them garments himself he
[40:53] made them garments and he threw the
[40:55] garment into the bush now remember
[40:57] the garment that god made for them was a
[41:00] godly
[41:00] holy garment that god had done but he
[41:03] put it
[41:04] in their possession for them to put on
[41:07] and then he did not put this on them if
[41:09] you look at the scripture
[41:11] he threw it in and brother brown tells
[41:13] us in his dramatization several places
[41:15] and he threw those uh bloody sheepskin
[41:18] and then for them to put on they had to
[41:20] dress themselves
[41:21] so as god provides the material as god
[41:24] provides the
[41:25] the way and and what we know is right in
[41:28] his eyes
[41:28] it is still up to the individual that we
[41:31] dress ourselves
[41:32] it was it was up to them in the garden
[41:34] of eden to dress themselves
[41:36] it was up to this priesthood even though
[41:37] that god had given them specific
[41:39] instructions
[41:40] it was up to them to dress themselves it
[41:43] was up to
[41:44] uh uh well just all through the bible it
[41:47] was specific of course with elijah and
[41:49] elisha it was very specific in the new
[41:52] testament
[41:52] when you come into a wedding and you
[41:54] didn't have the specific wedding garment
[41:56] as
[41:56] as an invited guest would have on you
[41:59] were considered as the bible said jesus
[42:01] said a thief and a robber
[42:02] because you couldn't get into that
[42:04] wedding without the proper garment on
[42:07] but they had to have that proper garment
[42:09] and they had to dress themselves
[42:11] but they had to have the garment see if
[42:14] you don't have the garment you can't put
[42:15] it on right
[42:16] but if you have the garment you need to
[42:18] put it on and so there's the whole
[42:20] different thing that we understand
[42:22] of the holy spirit that comes in our
[42:24] lives the holy spirit the anointing is
[42:26] there
[42:27] and the garment is available but the
[42:29] person has to put that garment on
[42:31] notice last week when we talked about
[42:33] the holy spirit coming on the day of
[42:35] pentecost
[42:36] the holy spirit come and swept through
[42:38] that upper room maybe similar to this
[42:40] room today i don't know it was 120 of
[42:42] them so
[42:42] it's a whole lot bigger than this room
[42:44] but maybe similar swept through that
[42:46] room
[42:47] and that holy spirit come and it lit on
[42:49] each one of them
[42:50] and it went into them so it wasn't just
[42:54] okay for the garment to be there
[42:56] it had to come and be a part of them
[42:58] they had to put that garment on that
[43:00] garment had to be something that was
[43:02] uh the prominent part of their lives
[43:05] just like it always has been
[43:07] just like it was from the garden of eden
[43:09] all the way through the scripture
[43:10] it's a very specific thing that god has
[43:13] so it's very important
[43:15] we talk about the title of the fitted
[43:17] garment it's very specific it's very
[43:19] important
[43:20] through the bible and in god's eyes
[43:24] makes the difference one way or the
[43:26] other what what god desires to have
[43:28] for us to wear physically yes in our
[43:32] normal
[43:32] natural bodies but also spiritually what
[43:35] we wear
[43:36] now in the spiritual aspect of it so
[43:38] garments have played a big role
[43:40] all through the bible you look as if you
[43:42] go
[43:43] through the bible again this year some
[43:44] people start the bible at the beginning
[43:46] of each year and read through it at the
[43:48] they take the year to read through it
[43:50] and if you do that that's fine if you
[43:51] don't that's fine as long as you read
[43:52] the scripture but
[43:53] i want you to just pay a particular
[43:55] close notice over the next 6 8 10 12
[43:58] months however long you're reading the
[43:59] bible and see
[44:00] how many references it gives it even
[44:02] talks about in
[44:03] let leviticus of the importance of the
[44:06] leprosy's garment
[44:08] the garment that lepers that lepers were
[44:11] to wear
[44:12] and and whether they were tainted or
[44:14] whether they were cleaned or whether
[44:16] they need to be burned
[44:17] think about um brother i believe it's
[44:20] brother biscuits testimony
[44:22] uh and i it just came to mind so i'm
[44:25] sorry about the details but
[44:27] uh there was a brother and sister that
[44:28] went on the hunting trip i believe when
[44:30] brother branham got the silver tip
[44:31] grizzly
[44:32] anyway their son always had epileptic
[44:34] fits
[44:35] and they prayed for him and they didn't
[44:37] know what to do for him and they did
[44:39] everything they possibly could do
[44:40] and brother branham said next time you
[44:42] go home
[44:44] he wears this specific shirt he said
[44:47] next time you go home
[44:48] and he and he has this bitter the man
[44:50] called his wife or something i think
[44:52] uh and please forgive me if i get some
[44:54] of the details wrong because the the
[44:56] gist of it is what i'm trying to get to
[44:58] but i'm trying to fill in the blank so
[45:00] it makes a little more sense but
[45:01] i believe he called to his wife said
[45:03] next time our son has that fit brother
[45:05] graham said next time he has that fit
[45:07] you take that shirt that he's got on and
[45:09] you take it off of him and take it and
[45:11] burn it
[45:13] and those and the the episode the
[45:15] seizures go away you don't think that
[45:18] that's important friend
[45:20] i mean how many without a profit or
[45:22] understanding those things
[45:24] would go tell somebody okay she actually
[45:27] went when he's having this fit if i
[45:28] remember the story right she had to
[45:30] actually
[45:30] jump on him and rip the shirt off of him
[45:33] she had because he was under
[45:35] he was out of control and she had to rip
[45:37] that shirt on him and take it and burn
[45:39] him immediately
[45:40] but the epilepsy went away she just
[45:43] stopped
[45:44] they quit because of a garment
[45:48] you might not think it's important
[45:50] friend but it's very important
[45:53] so much so let's continue to read this
[45:55] can we do that
[45:56] let's continue if anybody and if
[45:58] anybody's watching this
[46:00] anybody ever watches this if you don't
[46:03] think that it's it's important to god
[46:06] listen to this now we got the
[46:10] the fourth verse and all of these
[46:12] garments all these parts of garments are
[46:14] very important
[46:15] uh brother banh talks about i had them
[46:17] all written down here just before we
[46:19] continue on this
[46:20] uh the priesthood of course was to be
[46:22] hallowed and consecrated
[46:24] so once you understand and and keep that
[46:26] in mind as we go forward with this
[46:28] before we finish this because we'll get
[46:29] to that part
[46:31] obviously with the bride itself too
[46:33] that's hallowed and consecrated to the
[46:36] lord
[46:37] the garments now were to be holy
[46:40] garments
[46:41] now a holy garment is something that is
[46:43] set apart
[46:45] uh i looked up the hebrew
[46:48] of it and i couldn't dare try to
[46:51] pronounce the hebrew word
[46:52] but it means apartness holiness of
[46:55] course
[46:56] sacredness or separateness to be
[46:59] separated
[47:00] to be apart to be designated as someone
[47:04] or someone's
[47:05] that is a special called out to be
[47:09] what hallowed and consecrated before the
[47:12] lord
[47:13] taken out of just like brother branham
[47:16] tells us just like the scripture
[47:18] says the bride was taken out of a church
[47:21] why was the bride taken out of the
[47:24] church
[47:25] well the church put jesus on the outside
[47:27] knocking to get in
[47:29] so the bride had to come out because
[47:31] she's allowed him to come in her life
[47:34] the church has not the church has put
[47:36] him out so the bride had to come out of
[47:38] that
[47:39] revelation 18 be not partaker come out
[47:42] of her my people and be not partaker of
[47:44] her sin
[47:45] see so she had to come out to be howled
[47:48] and consecrated
[47:49] see to be set apart to be
[47:52] separate uh to be sacred
[47:56] the sacredness the holiness of it
[47:59] of course we get from the holy garment
[48:01] but the thing of that that i wanted us
[48:02] to get there
[48:03] was how god has called this bride out as
[48:06] a
[48:07] separate unique consecrated group of
[48:10] people
[48:11] holy yes uh uh sacredness
[48:15] but the apartments amen it's the whole
[48:18] thing that god
[48:18] calls us out of the world he calls
[48:22] us out of the church he calls us out of
[48:25] denominations to set
[48:26] us apart it's a it's a
[48:29] group of people it's god's wife amen
[48:32] it's god's wife
[48:34] and and uh men if you had a wife
[48:37] there's not many of us here uh of what
[48:40] we think about
[48:40] our wives and how much they mean to us
[48:43] and how much we
[48:44] chose that out of all the other wives in
[48:48] the world
[48:48] billions of women in the world we
[48:50] forsook for that one woman
[48:52] that we took into our bosom and took as
[48:54] our wife and you think about that
[48:56] just in a physical sense of what god's
[48:58] done in a spiritual sense for his bride
[49:01] and how much he loves his bride how much
[49:03] he wants his bride to be apart from the
[49:06] world
[49:06] to be separate from the world recognize
[49:09] what god did
[49:10] what did jehovah do with the with the
[49:13] israelite
[49:14] bride that he had espoused himself to to
[49:17] begin with
[49:18] he put her away for spiritual
[49:21] fornication
[49:22] because he called her out he called her
[49:25] apart
[49:26] from all the rest of the world he gave
[49:28] her everything that she needed
[49:30] and made sure that the traditions and
[49:32] all the things that they were to follow
[49:34] and live and do
[49:35] were separate from the rest of the world
[49:37] it made them look off of course
[49:39] made them look crazy silly why do you do
[49:41] that why do you act that way we went
[49:43] over that
[49:43] past couple of weekends but but but it
[49:46] showed them as a part
[49:47] but what did they do they began to marry
[49:49] themselves back up into the world again
[49:52] they were no longer no longer the
[49:55] separate
[49:56] group they were no longer the called out
[49:58] or apart group from the world
[50:00] and god put them away for their
[50:02] spiritual fornication
[50:03] because as they married themselves back
[50:05] up to the world again
[50:07] they began to fornicate god's word with
[50:09] man's idea
[50:11] and when they fornicated god's word with
[50:13] man's idea with man's opinion
[50:15] god put them away for spiritual
[50:17] fornication
[50:19] so what does he do this last friday he's
[50:20] telling this gentile writer this last
[50:23] day
[50:23] you are a separate group of people i
[50:26] have called you out
[50:27] i have ordained you i have called you
[50:30] to be a separate group apart from the
[50:33] rest of the world
[50:34] that's why you look different that's why
[50:36] you act different that's why you talk
[50:37] different that's why you go to different
[50:39] places
[50:40] or don't go to certain places that's why
[50:42] you're a separate
[50:43] group of people because i called you out
[50:46] of her
[50:46] to be not partaker of her sin
[50:50] amen that garment that god gave you now
[50:53] is that word garment that we stand
[50:55] holy consecrated it's a holy garment now
[51:00] and and aaron's garment now was to
[51:02] consecrate him
[51:04] but this garment i want you to notice
[51:06] now
[51:07] let me find it here this garment
[51:10] that that that they were supposed to
[51:12] make to them
[51:19] to consecrate him to minister the office
[51:21] it was supposed to be
[51:22] a garment of beauty it was supposed to
[51:25] be a garment of beauty
[51:27] but that beauty was unto the lord it was
[51:31] supposed to be a
[51:32] garment that they would minister to who
[51:37] not to you to him
[51:40] that's who we minister to we obviously
[51:43] do minister to one another but when
[51:45] we're ministering to one another who are
[51:47] we ministering to
[51:48] we're ministering to him i can't love
[51:51] him without loving you
[51:53] well how we're going to minister to one
[51:55] another how are we going to minister to
[51:57] this world
[51:58] if we're not ministering to him true
[52:00] that's why he said this
[52:02] priesthood is called out consecrated
[52:04] separate
[52:05] holy garments to minister where to me
[52:09] that's what god says so they can
[52:12] minister unto me
[52:13] in the priest's office that's why there
[52:15] has to be
[52:16] the place that god made the consecration
[52:19] that god had made and the garments that
[52:20] god had made
[52:21] but now look at this oh here it is of
[52:23] the second verse how shall i make holy
[52:25] garments for thy brother
[52:26] for glory and for what beauty
[52:30] amen for glory and for beauty well the
[52:33] glory is just the glory of god it's just
[52:35] a separateness
[52:36] amen of god is this it it is what we
[52:40] feel when the holy spirit comes into
[52:42] your life when the holy spirit and that
[52:44] anointing is on you you feel the
[52:46] presence of god
[52:47] that's the glory of god on you amen and
[52:50] that glory of god is exactly uh to bring
[52:53] the beauty of the holy spirit
[52:56] now this beauty is not a worldly beauty
[52:58] it's a godly beauty
[53:00] it's a beauty that that god is pleased
[53:02] with not that the world looks at
[53:04] you walk down some runway and half
[53:06] dressed or a third
[53:07] or probably not even a fourth dress
[53:09] anymore uh and show yourself off to the
[53:12] that's oh that's so beautiful no it's
[53:13] not that's a cankered sore friend in the
[53:16] eyes of god
[53:18] what's beautiful in the eyes of god is
[53:20] what's according to his word the
[53:21] properly dressed
[53:22] uh person the word dressed person
[53:26] the person that's dressed according to
[53:27] god's word in this last day
[53:30] amen it's very important i consider it
[53:32] important
[53:33] people in i i mentioned last week about
[53:36] uh
[53:36] uh this video that this man that we did
[53:39] the job for
[53:40] wanted to show me this church in
[53:41] colorado and the minister you know
[53:43] and a lot of the ministers today
[53:45] especially these big churches they like
[53:46] going to these big churches because
[53:48] you know the minister's all laid back
[53:50] and he's got flip-flops maybe shorts why
[53:52] and shirt or something and
[53:53] you know and he he tries to expound the
[53:55] gospel
[53:56] looking like he just okay
[54:00] i'm not going to say anything else
[54:03] looking like something i would not look
[54:05] like
[54:06] because i think it's very important yeah
[54:09] i come here dressed the way i do
[54:10] not because i'm a minister because i i
[54:13] understand the importance of what
[54:15] i believe that i'm giving to the lord
[54:17] this this is a part of my worship
[54:20] uh this is in my heart to give to the
[54:22] lord and that's why i do it
[54:25] different people dress different ways
[54:27] and that that's their choice and
[54:29] you give his unto the lord in your heart
[54:31] but that's why i do what i do
[54:33] amen i i think it's very important
[54:36] we don't come to god just uh just
[54:39] any old way uh wearing a rock and roll
[54:43] concert or something like that you know
[54:45] or
[54:45] uh just like a hobo in the street
[54:49] i don't even know if that's a term they
[54:50] use anymore that's probably not
[54:51] politically correct i don't really care
[54:53] but anyway
[54:54] uh you're not supposed to look like just
[54:56] i mean you
[54:57] if that's all you got that's fine right
[54:59] i mean that's perfectly fine
[55:01] if that's the best the person has that's
[55:03] fine
[55:04] but it's important that you give from
[55:06] the heart see
[55:07] and that's part of the worship now let's
[55:09] go you see
[55:10] how important it is and if people and if
[55:13] you're watching today
[55:14] you don't if we don't understand or see
[55:17] how important it is to god let's look at
[55:19] this
[55:20] let's start with the fifth verse now
[55:23] and they shall take gold and blue and
[55:26] purple
[55:26] and scarlet and fine linen and they
[55:30] shall make the ephod of gold
[55:32] a blue and a purple of scarlet and
[55:35] fine twine linen with cunning work now
[55:38] cunning work just means
[55:40] crafty it means uh uh
[55:43] you need to have somebody that knows
[55:44] what they're doing right it needs
[55:46] i forgot the the workmanship i forgot
[55:49] the exact
[55:50] word in there that that hebrew gives but
[55:52] it that that cunning just means that it
[55:55] needs to be a
[55:56] someone that's a workman it needs it
[55:58] needs to look good
[56:00] it's supposed to be crafted see
[56:03] yes y'all have the two shoulder pieces
[56:05] thereof joined at the two edges thereof
[56:08] and so
[56:08] it shall be joined together and the
[56:10] curious girdle of the ephod which is
[56:12] upon it shall be of the same according
[56:14] to the work thereof
[56:16] even of gold of blue and purple and
[56:18] scarlet and fine twine linen
[56:21] and thou shalt take two onyx stones and
[56:23] grit and grave
[56:25] on them the names of the children of
[56:27] israel six on
[56:28] uh six of their names on one stone six
[56:31] of their names on the rest of the other
[56:32] stone according to their birth
[56:34] according to their birth with the work
[56:37] of the engraver
[56:39] in stone like the engravings of a signal
[56:41] shalt thou engrave the two stones
[56:44] with the name of the children of israel
[56:45] thou shalt make them to be set in ouches
[56:48] of gold
[56:49] and thou shalt put the two stones upon
[56:51] the shoulder of the ephod for the stones
[56:53] memorial unto the children of israel
[56:55] and aaron shall bear their names before
[56:57] the lord upon his two shoulders for a
[56:59] memorial
[57:00] and thou shalt make ouches of gold and
[57:02] two chains of pure gold
[57:04] at the ends of wreath and work shalt
[57:07] thou make them and fasten the reed and
[57:09] change to the ouches
[57:11] and thou shalt make the breastplate of
[57:13] judgment with cunning work
[57:14] after the work of the upon do i need to
[57:16] go on
[57:17] [Music]
[57:18] do you you see here we can finish the
[57:21] rest of this chapter
[57:22] and many of the other parts of the
[57:23] scripture how very detailed
[57:26] to the thread right right to the very
[57:29] thread that is in these garments of how
[57:32] specific
[57:33] god is making this now if you were to
[57:35] say oh well
[57:37] uh why uh it says onyx stones
[57:40] but let's just take a couple of
[57:41] carbuncle stones it won't really matter
[57:44] we'll just take
[57:44] carbuncle is a lot easier to find so
[57:46] we'll just take a couple of carbuncle
[57:48] songs and we'll just carve the names of
[57:50] the children of israel in there god
[57:51] won't care yes he doesn't
[57:54] he said make it onyx and that's exactly
[57:57] what he said and that's exactly what he
[57:59] meant
[58:00] anything less than that would have been
[58:02] displeasing to the lord
[58:04] he said gold purple scarlet uh blue
[58:08] oh well i i think red would look good
[58:10] well my favorite color is green well
[58:12] let's throw a little bit of
[58:14] no fine twine
[58:17] linen why cotton is good it feels more
[58:19] comfortable no no no
[58:21] find everything about this i want you to
[58:23] understand
[58:24] how important it is and people say well
[58:26] god's not in the details
[58:28] yes he is if there's anybody that ever
[58:31] was
[58:32] it's god right he cares to the very
[58:35] thread of this garment to the very
[58:37] thread
[58:38] now the seriousness of this and we can
[58:40] continue reading
[58:42] now brother the bible goes specifically
[58:44] into directions
[58:45] on the breastplate right the ephod the
[58:48] girdle
[58:49] the robe everything about it and
[58:52] each stone that's supposed to be in
[58:54] there and the names that are supposed to
[58:56] be carved on the onyx stones on the
[58:58] shoulder now all this has
[59:00] significance and meaning of course but
[59:01] that's another message uh that they
[59:04] carries on his shoulders with their
[59:06] names pointed up to heaven all six of
[59:08] all twelve of them six on
[59:09] one and six on the other according to
[59:11] their birth he
[59:12] they weren't even to just put down names
[59:14] randomly it had to be according to their
[59:17] birth
[59:18] amen because that was specific to god
[59:21] that's the way god wanted it that was
[59:22] his desire
[59:23] and if we're here to try to please the
[59:25] lord we're not doing this because we
[59:27] want to do it the way we think it should
[59:29] be done
[59:29] but that's exactly the way god people
[59:32] approach god today
[59:33] that's exactly the same attitude a lot
[59:35] of people have about being able to
[59:37] please the lord or going to church or
[59:39] reading the bible or translating the
[59:41] bible or something
[59:42] they have this idea that they can that
[59:45] that they can just do it however they
[59:47] think is okay
[59:49] it doesn't work that way
[59:54] people say well that's the old testament
[59:56] well
[59:57] then let's just take the old testament
[59:58] throw it away right
[1:00:00] it's also in the new testament but if
[1:00:02] you don't want to look at the old
[1:00:03] testament we can just throw that
[1:00:05] just throw that in the garbage and just
[1:00:06] forget about the old testament
[1:00:08] but understand that everything in the
[1:00:10] old testament is
[1:00:12] physically as type and shadow of mostly
[1:00:14] spiritually what happens today
[1:00:16] we know what the human thunder means
[1:00:18] today right we don't have the 12 stones
[1:00:20] above
[1:00:20] the breastplate the holy spirit is here
[1:00:23] right amen
[1:00:24] we know what the breastplate is it's
[1:00:25] still the same it's god but it's got
[1:00:28] to be pleasing to the lord amen now the
[1:00:30] seriousness of this
[1:00:32] reflects the seriousness of what goes on
[1:00:35] in this last day
[1:00:36] it reflects the seriousness of what's
[1:00:38] happening today
[1:00:40] because disobedience to god's word
[1:00:43] brings death
[1:00:45] and disobedience to god's word here
[1:00:47] brought physical death
[1:00:49] disobedience to god's word today brings
[1:00:52] spiritual death
[1:00:53] if anything if any part of this was off
[1:00:58] if the miter the girdle the coat the
[1:01:01] road
[1:01:02] the effort the breastplate in any of
[1:01:04] this
[1:01:05] to the very thread and color
[1:01:09] was off and that high priest tried to go
[1:01:13] aaron tried to go behind into the
[1:01:14] holiest place the holies of holies
[1:01:17] he dropped dead pray for them they even
[1:01:20] god even told them to put the
[1:01:21] pomegranates and the bells around the
[1:01:23] bottom
[1:01:24] of the robe i believe it was the road
[1:01:27] yeah the rope which was the outside
[1:01:29] garment
[1:01:30] which is strange because robe is out but
[1:01:33] the coat was the coat was actually an
[1:01:36] undergarment if you go and read it the
[1:01:37] coat was a tunic or an undergarment
[1:01:39] which today we use a coat as an outer
[1:01:41] garment usually but the robe
[1:01:42] was the outer garment and around the
[1:01:44] bottom of it was the pomegranates and
[1:01:46] the veils pomegranate bell pomegranate
[1:01:48] bell pomegranate bell
[1:01:49] and as you walk through there as brother
[1:01:51] branham talks about it he says
[1:01:53] when this man this high priest went in
[1:01:56] behind it to that hole as of holies that
[1:01:58] those bells had to ring holy holy holy
[1:02:01] lord god almighty as he walked into that
[1:02:03] holiest of places and if there was
[1:02:06] anything out of sword if there was
[1:02:08] anything out of place and what god had
[1:02:10] said that man would drop
[1:02:12] dead they put a rope they put a rope
[1:02:15] around him
[1:02:17] that when he went into that holy of holy
[1:02:19] place that if
[1:02:20] anything was off and he dropped dead
[1:02:23] they could pull him out with a rope
[1:02:24] because you didn't dare go behind that
[1:02:26] holy place
[1:02:27] if you went into that holy place you
[1:02:29] dropped dead too
[1:02:31] because it was had to be exactly the way
[1:02:33] god
[1:02:34] had orchestrated it to be that's how
[1:02:36] specific he is
[1:02:38] you look at this and see we can again
[1:02:40] continue to read this
[1:02:42] very god's very detailed about it
[1:02:45] very detailed well if he was very
[1:02:47] detailed
[1:02:48] about this uh uh uh this situation this
[1:02:53] this outer garment this uh this fleshly
[1:02:56] thing
[1:02:57] then what do you think that god is
[1:02:59] specific about his
[1:03:00] word and the revelation of his word
[1:03:03] today
[1:03:06] you don't think god's specific about his
[1:03:08] word today
[1:03:10] about the application of his word about
[1:03:12] the revelation of his word
[1:03:14] i mean he even tells his bride for this
[1:03:16] last day he even tells his people
[1:03:19] that we're not even cast our pearl
[1:03:21] before swine
[1:03:22] right right you know that the bible says
[1:03:25] that we are the the beautiful
[1:03:27] jewels and and precious gems and this
[1:03:30] uh uh great golden nuggets that god has
[1:03:33] given us
[1:03:34] that we are not to cast before swine
[1:03:37] right
[1:03:37] right to be trodden under their feet
[1:03:42] we're not supposed to do that now to
[1:03:44] witness to people that's all right
[1:03:46] to talk to people about it to try to
[1:03:48] encourage people that's okay
[1:03:50] but when people turn away from it and
[1:03:52] they deny it
[1:03:53] and they want to trample over it you
[1:03:55] just leave it alone right
[1:03:57] you don't push it you don't try to make
[1:03:59] it you can make things worse more than
[1:04:01] you can better
[1:04:03] amen that's why if i do something like
[1:04:05] that i try to feel led of the lord to do
[1:04:07] it
[1:04:08] there's nothing wrong if you just feel
[1:04:09] inspired or something you just think man
[1:04:11] i really want to talk to this person
[1:04:12] about the lord there's nothing wrong
[1:04:14] with that
[1:04:14] just be careful amen just be careful
[1:04:16] because you can make matters worse than
[1:04:19] better
[1:04:20] amen because i'd rather somebody
[1:04:23] have a chance to get in than to
[1:04:26] completely blaspheme the holy ghost and
[1:04:28] have no chance at all right
[1:04:30] yeah and because of sometimes it might
[1:04:32] be that you push it so hard
[1:04:34] that they blaspheme it then we've made
[1:04:37] it worse than better
[1:04:38] yeah but god is very specific about in
[1:04:41] this last day
[1:04:42] and his word and his word garment very
[1:04:45] specific about it that's why he
[1:04:47] uh that's why he went into great detail
[1:04:50] about it
[1:04:50] now there's a garment of course that a
[1:04:54] a an invisible garment that this bride
[1:04:57] for this last day is supposed to wear
[1:04:59] in ephesians chapter six
[1:05:02] we talked about this uh i went into
[1:05:05] great detail about all of this
[1:05:07] uh a year or so ago something like that
[1:05:11] but the whole armor of god ephesians
[1:05:14] chapter six verse
[1:05:15] um we'll just say verse 10
[1:05:18] we'll just start with verse 10 here
[1:05:20] ephesians chapter 6 verse
[1:05:22] 10 finally my brother be strong in the
[1:05:25] lord and the power of his might
[1:05:27] put on the whole armor of god now who's
[1:05:29] supposed to put it on
[1:05:30] you are i am we're supposed to put on
[1:05:35] our own armor put on the whole armor of
[1:05:38] god
[1:05:40] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:05:42] wiles of the devil
[1:05:44] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:05:46] blood but against principalities against
[1:05:48] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[1:05:51] this world against
[1:05:52] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:05:55] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:05:57] of god that ye may be able to withstand
[1:06:00] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:06:03] stand
[1:06:04] stand therefore now what day is this
[1:06:07] that evil day what day are we living
[1:06:10] a very evil wicked day
[1:06:14] stand there for having your loins gert
[1:06:17] now i could i i have a message where i
[1:06:19] kind of compare these two but
[1:06:21] that that would take a whole another
[1:06:23] hour but just listen as i read through
[1:06:25] this
[1:06:26] to compare this with what uh
[1:06:30] god gave the high priest or the the
[1:06:32] priesthood dear that we just read in in
[1:06:34] exodus 28 listen now
[1:06:37] having your loin skirt with the truth
[1:06:40] having on the blessed
[1:06:41] the breastplate of righteousness your
[1:06:43] feet
[1:06:44] shod with the preparation the gospel of
[1:06:46] peace above
[1:06:47] all take the shield of faith wherewith
[1:06:49] ye may be able to quench
[1:06:51] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[1:06:53] take the helmet of salvation
[1:06:55] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:06:57] word of god now that
[1:06:58] matches almost exactly everything
[1:07:01] god gave the high priest or the
[1:07:03] priesthood at that time the arianic
[1:07:05] priesthood
[1:07:06] for them to go into that holy place
[1:07:09] the girdle was a sash the coat was an
[1:07:12] undergarment the robe was an outer
[1:07:14] garment with the pomegranate's bells
[1:07:16] which covered the top part the ephod was
[1:07:19] a shoulder
[1:07:20] mantle uh outer garment that the
[1:07:23] that the breast plate was on the
[1:07:25] breastplate was above the girdle which
[1:07:27] the breastplate covered the heart
[1:07:29] the girdle covered the uh the uh
[1:07:32] reproductive area which uh having your
[1:07:35] loins
[1:07:36] gert it says here notice this having
[1:07:39] your
[1:07:40] your lawns gird about with truth well
[1:07:43] that's
[1:07:43] exactly what the girdle did the same
[1:07:45] part of the body
[1:07:46] all this covered and of course the miter
[1:07:49] was the helmet
[1:07:51] the headpiece that was the that was in
[1:07:53] the arionic priesthood that god asked
[1:07:56] us to have of course the the the helmet
[1:07:58] of salvation the sword of the spirit
[1:08:00] which is the word of god
[1:08:02] sword which is the word of course now
[1:08:04] that's the
[1:08:05] the the weaponry that we have to defeat
[1:08:08] the enemy
[1:08:09] is the word of god that word is what god
[1:08:12] gave us
[1:08:13] to destroy the enemy with now this
[1:08:17] chosen garment that god gave us
[1:08:20] now again a year or so ago whatever we
[1:08:23] went through this that whole
[1:08:24] teaching there uh of each part of that
[1:08:27] and
[1:08:28] what it meant and and we made some time
[1:08:31] i have before
[1:08:32] do the same with those uh priests
[1:08:34] garments the arianic priesthood every
[1:08:36] bit of it
[1:08:37] even to the the consecration of their
[1:08:40] garments and the consecration of their
[1:08:41] bodies
[1:08:42] to be washed and and and the cakes that
[1:08:44] were supposed to be offered and some
[1:08:46] that had oil and smeared and some that
[1:08:48] had mingled it
[1:08:49] every bit of it representing of course
[1:08:51] christ
[1:08:52] and that priesthood every bit of it had
[1:08:54] meaning
[1:08:56] signification so uh but lord willing we
[1:08:59] just go to that but understanding now
[1:09:01] how important this garment is how
[1:09:04] important these garments are to us
[1:09:06] you say well brother newton and why do
[1:09:08] we today you're talking about a
[1:09:10] priesthood
[1:09:11] you're talking about an arionic
[1:09:12] priesthood at that time which we're not
[1:09:15] even a part of the levitical priesthood
[1:09:16] anymore
[1:09:18] uh this this this bride the ministry
[1:09:21] this gentile ministry the last day is
[1:09:23] not
[1:09:23] it's a replication of levitical
[1:09:25] priesthood but it's not an example of
[1:09:27] the
[1:09:28] levitical priesthood or a following in
[1:09:31] of that
[1:09:31] we're not levitical priests amen
[1:09:34] but in first peter it tells us exactly
[1:09:37] so you say well that's just
[1:09:39] that's just you brother you know it's
[1:09:40] not
[1:09:42] it is not just for the priesthood today
[1:09:46] notice um in first peter
[1:09:51] first peter chapter two
[1:09:57] wherefore laying inside all malice and
[1:09:59] all god
[1:10:00] hypocrisy envies and all evil speaking
[1:10:03] as newborn babies desire the sincere
[1:10:05] milk of the word that ye may grow
[1:10:06] thereby
[1:10:08] if so be have tasted of the lord that
[1:10:10] the lord is gracious
[1:10:12] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[1:10:16] disallowed in the god and precious
[1:10:19] ye also ye also not the priesthood
[1:10:23] not the ministers but ye also as
[1:10:26] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:10:29] house
[1:10:30] unholy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:10:34] sacrifices
[1:10:35] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:10:38] that is for every one of us to do that
[1:10:41] scriptures for every one of us
[1:10:43] to fulfill a holy royal
[1:10:46] priesthood to minister
[1:10:49] amen to minister you may not stand up
[1:10:52] here and ever say a single word friend
[1:10:54] but you minister with your lives through
[1:10:56] the holy spirit
[1:10:58] and the token that's upon you every
[1:11:00] single day
[1:11:01] to have that token on display shows to
[1:11:04] the rest of the world
[1:11:05] who you are who you belong to
[1:11:08] what your life is like in a part of
[1:11:11] that's the holy spirit
[1:11:13] they might understand it in fact they
[1:11:15] probably won't
[1:11:16] they probably don't understand it they
[1:11:18] your old fashion
[1:11:20] or or or whatever they want to say but
[1:11:23] the truth of it is they're witnessing
[1:11:26] the holy spirit
[1:11:27] and they don't recognize it right
[1:11:29] they're witnessing
[1:11:31] the manifestation of jesus christ again
[1:11:34] and they don't know it
[1:11:36] a lot of them won't know it but it
[1:11:38] doesn't change the fact
[1:11:40] of what god is doing in our life right
[1:11:43] ministering
[1:11:44] witnessing our lives this uh
[1:11:47] this priesthood ministering to the souls
[1:11:50] that are in prison
[1:11:52] out in the world today and we offer up
[1:11:55] those spiritual sacrifices
[1:11:57] acceptable to god by jesus christ now
[1:11:59] what is acceptable
[1:12:01] by god or to god what's acceptable to
[1:12:04] god
[1:12:04] only thing that's acceptable to god is
[1:12:06] what's in his word
[1:12:08] it's the only thing that's acceptable to
[1:12:09] him anything else is not acceptable to
[1:12:12] god
[1:12:12] well i think i'll offer my degree or my
[1:12:15] lld or my
[1:12:16] uh uh thing that i did in college and
[1:12:23] i'll just offer up my my accomplishments
[1:12:27] and
[1:12:27] you know i i've got a doctorate's degree
[1:12:30] or master's degree or something and
[1:12:31] i'll just offer him you know what i
[1:12:34] think
[1:12:35] that i can give well that's the exact
[1:12:36] same thing kane did
[1:12:38] right came what he had was fruits and
[1:12:41] vegetables and that's what he tried to
[1:12:42] give to god
[1:12:43] without revelation of course then meant
[1:12:46] nothing to god god rejected it his
[1:12:47] countenance failed he killed his brother
[1:12:50] there's the result what'd it do brought
[1:12:52] death
[1:12:53] displeasing to the lord brought death
[1:12:55] now this was a little more indirectly
[1:12:57] but it brought death to abel but then
[1:12:59] god put seth in his place and raised up
[1:13:01] another one
[1:13:02] of course god told cain that his blood
[1:13:06] then
[1:13:06] spoke to him still still
[1:13:10] uh still manifesting itself so if we
[1:13:13] want to do something pleasing to god
[1:13:15] we need to make sure it's what he says
[1:13:17] is pleasing to him
[1:13:19] not what we think might be pleasing and
[1:13:22] again
[1:13:22] he's very specific about what he's
[1:13:25] pleased with
[1:13:27] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:13:29] scripture behold i lay in zion a chief
[1:13:31] cornerstone elect
[1:13:33] precious he that believeth on him shall
[1:13:35] not be confounded
[1:13:36] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:13:38] precious but unto them which be
[1:13:40] disobedient the stone which the builders
[1:13:42] disallowed
[1:13:42] the same has made the head of the corner
[1:13:44] and a stone of
[1:13:46] stumbling and a rock of offense even to
[1:13:48] them which stumble
[1:13:49] at the word being disobedient whereunto
[1:13:52] also they were appointed they were
[1:13:55] appointed to it but it stumbled at
[1:13:57] it when they stumbled they fail
[1:14:01] amen many are called
[1:14:05] okay many are called appointed
[1:14:09] few are chosen many are called fewer
[1:14:12] chosen
[1:14:14] understand there's a difference just
[1:14:15] like the bride being called out of the
[1:14:17] church
[1:14:19] brought out of the church but ye amen
[1:14:23] you you are a chosen
[1:14:26] generation a royal priesthood
[1:14:30] and a holy nation a peculiar
[1:14:33] people do you think you're peculiar
[1:14:36] people
[1:14:37] no yeah if you don't think you're a
[1:14:39] peculiar people look in that mirror
[1:14:42] i mean you'll find out real quick
[1:14:44] especially if you've seen all the things
[1:14:45] out in the world today
[1:14:46] how peculiar you are it's strange
[1:14:50] but you look at it you say and you get
[1:14:52] out in the world
[1:14:53] and you got hair sticking everywhere and
[1:14:56] all kind of colors and piercings and
[1:14:58] tats and tattoos and
[1:14:59] everything and drawers hanging down and
[1:15:02] uh
[1:15:03] everything and you think man those
[1:15:04] people are crazy you look over there's
[1:15:06] another one there's another one there's
[1:15:07] another one there's another one there's
[1:15:09] they're everywhere well you know what
[1:15:10] that means that means you're the crazy
[1:15:12] one not them
[1:15:14] in their world you're the crazy one
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:18] in their world you're the oddball so
[1:15:21] we're the odd ones you look at it say
[1:15:23] yes i'm peculiar
[1:15:25] and we are but we're supposed to be
[1:15:28] we're not supposed to follow in line
[1:15:29] with the rest of the world and the rest
[1:15:31] of everything else
[1:15:32] you take a lot of the churches out today
[1:15:34] you line them all up and you say well
[1:15:37] okay well i think she
[1:15:40] i don't you can't tell the prostitute
[1:15:42] from the other one
[1:15:43] right and vice versa and all about it
[1:15:48] there's no difference so well that
[1:15:50] that's a faithful car singer in our
[1:15:52] church
[1:15:53] okay well what's the difference
[1:15:57] the difference is many are coffee or
[1:15:58] chosen
[1:16:00] people love to do it but they do it on
[1:16:02] their own you can't do it right you have
[1:16:03] to do it
[1:16:05] we have to live our lives
[1:16:08] consecrated to the lord and where we're
[1:16:11] consecrated to the lord that means we
[1:16:14] are
[1:16:14] dead my opinions my thoughts my feelings
[1:16:18] the way i think it should be
[1:16:19] gone everything about every kind of a
[1:16:23] a a man's idea or opinion or dogma
[1:16:26] church tradition gone consecration means
[1:16:30] i do it
[1:16:31] by the scripture the way god asked for
[1:16:33] me to do it
[1:16:34] amen that's why you're a peculiar people
[1:16:38] a royal priesthood you are chosen by god
[1:16:43] amen chosen and picked by god
[1:16:46] as a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:16:48] peculiar people that you should
[1:16:50] show forth the praises of him who have
[1:16:54] called you out of darkness into his
[1:16:56] marvelous life
[1:16:57] which in time past were not a people but
[1:17:00] are now the people of god which had not
[1:17:02] obtained mercy but now i've obtained
[1:17:04] mercy we were
[1:17:05] heathens gentiles heathens clubs on our
[1:17:08] backs we weren't even a people
[1:17:10] but god called you when god called you
[1:17:13] he made you something
[1:17:14] it's the glass in the chicken yard when
[1:17:17] god called you took it out
[1:17:18] cleaned it up put it in service
[1:17:20] justification sanctification the holy
[1:17:22] spirit who did that that was god
[1:17:25] god picked you god chose you god's the
[1:17:27] one that set you apart

[1:17:45] this
[1:17:45] to this uh souls that are imprisoned we
[1:17:48] minister
[1:17:49] because of the lives that we live
[1:17:51] because of who we are
[1:17:53] because of who god has made us to be
[1:17:56] amen
[1:17:56] amen this whole armor amen let me see
[1:18:01] if i can sneak another one time runs out
[1:18:04] so fast
[1:18:05] uh revelation 19.
[1:18:12] revelation 19 chapter 1 we spoke of it
[1:18:15] briefly a few moments ago
[1:18:18] and after these things i heard a great
[1:18:20] voice of much people in heaven saying
[1:18:22] hallelujah salvation and glory and honor
[1:18:24] and power unto the lord our god
[1:18:26] for true and righteous are his judgments
[1:18:28] for he hath judged the great core
[1:18:30] which did corrupt the earth with her
[1:18:32] fornication and hath avenged the blood
[1:18:34] of his saints
[1:18:35] at her hand
[1:18:39] revelation 13 and 17.
[1:18:43] amen and again they said hallelujah
[1:18:45] their smoke rose up forever and ever and
[1:18:47] the four and 20 elders and the four
[1:18:49] beasts
[1:18:50] fell down and worshiped god that sat on
[1:18:52] the throne saying
[1:18:53] amen hallelujah notice that the four
[1:18:56] beasts
[1:18:57] also four and twenty elders fell but the
[1:18:59] four beasts
[1:19:00] right fell and worshipped god and a
[1:19:03] voice came out of the throne saying
[1:19:05] praise our god
[1:19:06] all ye his servants and ye that fear him
[1:19:09] both small and great and i heard as it
[1:19:11] were the voice of a great multitude
[1:19:13] and as the voice of many waters the
[1:19:15] ministers the gospel going forth
[1:19:18] the the end time message and as the
[1:19:21] voice of mighty
[1:19:22] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[1:19:23] lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:19:26] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:19:28] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:19:30] lamb is come and his wife
[1:19:32] hath made herself ready
[1:19:35] she's made herself ready based on
[1:19:39] what the previous scripture has told us
[1:19:42] the voice of many waters the multitude
[1:19:44] coming forth the thunderings of the word
[1:19:47] the message the truth of god's word the
[1:19:50] vindicated
[1:19:52] worthy hour going forth and ministering
[1:19:55] to those people
[1:19:56] the justification that came in through
[1:19:58] sanctification to the holy spirit
[1:20:01] ministering by the word in a last day
[1:20:03] vindicated word prophet william brown to
[1:20:06] bring that word
[1:20:07] to a people now she's clothed in that
[1:20:10] word she has that word
[1:20:12] she has that word we got we got it on
[1:20:15] computers we got it on the internet we
[1:20:17] got on
[1:20:19] mp3s we got it on ipods we got it on
[1:20:22] books we got it
[1:20:24] in more ways than i could probably even
[1:20:26] think of right now
[1:20:28] but then what does that bride have to do
[1:20:30] with it
[1:20:31] it says the wife
[1:20:34] had made herself ready
[1:20:37] just like adam and eve did in the garden
[1:20:39] of eden just like these
[1:20:40] uh the aryanic priesthood just like
[1:20:43] those all through the scripture had to
[1:20:45] do
[1:20:45] you have to put that garment on you have
[1:20:48] to wear that garment
[1:20:49] let that garment show who you really are
[1:20:52] let it let it live through you because
[1:20:55] this
[1:20:56] isn't a physical garment of a bloody
[1:20:58] sheepskin or a
[1:20:59] fine twined linen but this is a garment
[1:21:02] listen
[1:21:03] that was granted to her eighth verse
[1:21:06] that she should be arrayed in that fine
[1:21:09] linen
[1:21:10] now it's i said not find linen but i
[1:21:12] meant
[1:21:13] literally tangibly fine linen
[1:21:17] this is a spiritual garment it is clean
[1:21:20] and white
[1:21:22] for the fine linen is what the
[1:21:24] righteousness of the saints
[1:21:26] which is what the righteousness of jesus
[1:21:28] christ which she has become
[1:21:30] because she's his wife the two become
[1:21:34] one
[1:21:35] the twain are now become one
[1:21:39] some of you may have noticed this got to
[1:21:41] close here in just a minute
[1:21:42] y'all may have noticed this you notice
[1:21:44] that tabitha
[1:21:47] i don't get off the street this right
[1:21:50] here
[1:21:53] this came from zach and tabitha's
[1:21:55] wedding
[1:21:57] i found it as we were cleaning up
[1:22:00] and there was thousands of these little
[1:22:02] things to have the hat all over the
[1:22:04] place
[1:22:05] uh some would call it litter but
[1:22:08] it was something that had been cut to
[1:22:11] made up his little hearts i don't even
[1:22:12] know what this is
[1:22:14] but i found one on their wedding day
[1:22:18] and i took it and i put it right here in
[1:22:21] my bible
[1:22:25] now i think it's matthew 20.
[1:22:31] if i remember right or it's right in
[1:22:33] there you know the scripture
[1:22:36] where it says whom god hath joined
[1:22:39] together
[1:22:40] let no man put asunder i took that
[1:22:45] there at their wedding and i found it
[1:22:46] and i went to that scripture and it sits
[1:22:48] there in my bible
[1:22:49] been there ever since however many years
[1:22:52] they've been married
[1:22:53] sets here you see it's freight on the
[1:22:54] end but if you ever wonder what that is
[1:22:56] sticking out of my bible that's what it
[1:22:58] is
[1:22:58] it just sits there where it says what
[1:23:00] god had joined together that no man put
[1:23:02] us under
[1:23:03] hallelujah god has joined together a
[1:23:06] bride he has married a bride
[1:23:09] if god has married a wife no man
[1:23:12] can put her away no man can divorce
[1:23:15] or take her asunder because the two have
[1:23:18] become one
[1:23:20] the twain flesh had become one
[1:23:23] he is the word well if she is his wife
[1:23:26] she is the word also
[1:23:28] if he is righteous she is righteous also
[1:23:31] and she has that wedding garment on to
[1:23:33] prove it and to live it
[1:23:36] so that that word manifest through her
[1:23:39] as the wife of jesus christ
[1:23:41] amen and let no man no man
[1:23:44] put asunder the two that have become one
[1:23:48] they cannot be divided they cannot be
[1:23:50] separated
[1:23:52] amen i was going to go you see in
[1:23:55] deuteronomy 22
[1:23:56] most of you know that scripture
[1:23:59] it talks about the woman shall not wear
[1:24:01] a garment pertaineth to a man
[1:24:03] but i want to read this quote to you

[1:24:26] brown
[1:24:26] ever preached there or preached period
[1:24:29] you should
[1:24:30] remember that night before i seen that
[1:24:32] i've seen the preview of the bride i
[1:24:34] stood there
[1:24:35] seeing a beautiful little lady just
[1:24:36] correctly dressed in things
[1:24:39] that beautiful lady correctly dressed
[1:24:42] was she dressed in
[1:24:44] marching this way there was somebody
[1:24:46] standing by me in the vision and i seen
[1:24:48] they said the preview of the bride
[1:24:50] i seen her go by they come on this side
[1:24:52] and went up around
[1:24:54] i heard it coming up the church was
[1:24:55] coming up from uh from this other side
[1:24:59] uh there come the asian church oh you
[1:25:02] talk about such a filth

[1:25:16] by a witch now he doesn't say it in the
[1:25:19] rapture message
[1:25:20] but if you go back to recognizing his
[1:25:22] day it says she was
[1:25:23] led the the the last day
[1:25:27] this this uh a gentile of miss america
[1:25:31] was led by a witch

[1:26:01] paper like a gray holding in front of
[1:26:02] her of course gray you know it's
[1:26:04] hypocrite
[1:26:05] not black or white just of course
[1:26:08] laodicea
[1:26:10] i stood there in his presence and i
[1:26:12] thought oh god as a minister if that's
[1:26:14] the best we could do
[1:26:16] you know how you feel then i thought god
[1:26:18] hide me if i could just get away from
[1:26:20] here
[1:26:21] all i've done and that's all that we can
[1:26:23] have to produce
[1:26:25] and then when them women pass by all
[1:26:28] doing all kind of rock and rolls and
[1:26:29] short hair painted faces
[1:26:32] they pass by like that supposed to be
[1:26:34] virgins to jesus
[1:26:36] christ then when she passed by like that
[1:26:39] i turned my head you know with this
[1:26:41] just holding that in front of me was
[1:26:43] disgraceful he said you know basically
[1:26:45] hiding himself from
[1:26:46] the back of them so he was just
[1:26:48] completely they were just naked
[1:26:50] from behind he said they were going on
[1:26:52] like that and i turned my head to weep
[1:26:54] like that and i
[1:26:55] just couldn't stand there to see that
[1:26:58] standing there we know uh that me a
[1:27:00] minister of a church and that's what i'd
[1:27:02] produce for him
[1:27:03] he said oh just let me die let me fade
[1:27:05] away and as soon as it went out
[1:27:07] every one of them would uh would come
[1:27:09] they would go out to a certain place and
[1:27:11] they would drop off
[1:27:13] and i then heard a sound as it as those
[1:27:15] went away and i heard a sound something
[1:27:17] like onward christian soldiers
[1:27:19] and i looked here come that sainted
[1:27:21] bunch of little girls just exactly the
[1:27:23] way they was
[1:27:24] all correctly dressed hair hanging down
[1:27:27] their back smooth
[1:27:28] clean marching like this to the step of
[1:27:31] the gospel
[1:27:32] she was the word
[1:27:35] amen of course what was she dressed in
[1:27:39] she was dressed in the word all
[1:27:40] correctly dressed beautiful
[1:27:42] i looked out at every nation i was
[1:27:44] looking back and passed by and seeing
[1:27:46] them instead of going down
[1:27:48] they started going up each one of the
[1:27:50] others was dropping off as they went off
[1:27:52] to the end
[1:27:53] this one as they went off to the edge of
[1:27:55] the vision they started going
[1:27:56] up they started going up and i noticed
[1:27:59] him trying two or three of them at the
[1:28:01] end he says of course you know at the
[1:28:02] end of that vision he said
[1:28:04] some up at the back of it he started
[1:28:06] screaming stay in line and he left the
[1:28:08] vision seeing he kept saying
[1:28:10] woke up in his room saying stay in line
[1:28:12] stay in line
[1:28:13] but notice that bride of this last day
[1:28:15] yes
[1:28:16] he talked about that at the end a little
[1:28:18] getting out of step a little bit
[1:28:20] but she's still a bride amen she's still
[1:28:23] dressed in
[1:28:24] fine twine linens clean and pure
[1:28:27] holy righteous without spot wrinkle or
[1:28:30] blemish

[1:32:32] amen so god richard bless you today
[1:32:35] appreciate you coming and being here so
[1:32:37] god is good
[1:32:38] i'll let you know where we're going to
[1:32:41] be week to week
[1:32:42] we may stay here the man asked me if we
[1:32:44] were going to stay here i said
[1:32:46] well i'm not sure um originally when i
[1:32:49] came in
[1:32:51] it's like 350 dollars for the room
[1:32:54] and i said well we only need it for a
[1:32:56] couple of hours
[1:32:58] and he said 175 and then we're standing
[1:33:01] here talking and talking and he knocked
[1:33:02] 25
[1:33:03] off to 150 and i thought well
[1:33:08] you know that seemed okay because that's
[1:33:11] basically what we were paying at the
[1:33:12] other place
[1:33:13] six hundred dollars a month really 150 a
[1:33:16] week
[1:33:17] but then i called every hotel
[1:33:21] all the way from torterro every hotel on
[1:33:24] the interstate all the way down to about
[1:33:25] right here
[1:33:26] i didn't want to go any further south no
[1:33:28] offense but most of the hotels just
[1:33:30] south of here
[1:33:31] not nice places so uh i knew the days
[1:33:35] inn had one but it's kind of small
[1:33:37] so i called all of them they either
[1:33:40] didn't have one
[1:33:41] uh root red roof was closed down for
[1:33:44] kovid
[1:33:45] uh they were way too much some were 450
[1:33:48] dollars
[1:33:49] um one lady lied to me up on cortero
[1:33:53] uh initially the room was available
[1:33:56] and uh and then when i told her what we
[1:33:59] were doing she said hold on a second she
[1:34:01] came back said no the room's not
[1:34:02] available
[1:34:03] anyway uh which is okay uh i checked
[1:34:07] around tucson malls two or three hotels
[1:34:09] and going forward
[1:34:10] anyway so i called back
[1:34:13] uh friday afternoon and told him here
[1:34:16] that we would take this
[1:34:18] and he said okay well then he said we'll
[1:34:21] be 125.
[1:34:23] so i'm assuming that we paid 125 for
[1:34:26] today
[1:34:28] and at 125 i probably willing to just do
[1:34:32] it for the next few weeks
[1:34:34] uh i saw brother uh brother roger
[1:34:36] brother john
[1:34:37] yarborough friday and we called the
[1:34:40] realtor the other place while we were
[1:34:42] sitting there
[1:34:43] and they got an agreement on the air
[1:34:45] conditioning unit for their place
[1:34:47] but they're still trying to work
[1:34:48] something out with marana
[1:34:50] because it's 2400 square foot space and
[1:34:52] there's only one bathroom
[1:34:54] steel only one bathroom a lot of these
[1:34:57] places they're
[1:34:58] they're decent prices to get into but
[1:35:00] for a church like this
[1:35:03] they almost all of them only have one
[1:35:04] bathroom so
[1:35:06] it can be a complication uh with a
[1:35:09] bigger space
[1:35:11] so they're trying to work that out
[1:35:12] they're trying to work out an agreement
[1:35:14] with the landlord
[1:35:15] uh on the price but he doesn't think
[1:35:17] that's going to be a problem
[1:35:19] and once that's done and they get the
[1:35:21] air conditioner put in
[1:35:22] then we can move in that's so it but it
[1:35:25] may be another month
[1:35:26] or so before all of that happens but
[1:35:29] it's in the hands of the lord amen so
[1:35:31] whatever his will is
[1:35:33] i found out the building on first avenue
[1:35:35] is about four thousand dollars a month
[1:35:38] would be perfect uh but uh that's just a
[1:35:42] bit more than what we can afford so
[1:35:45] uh but there's like 20 25 parking spaces
[1:35:48] that's freestanding building it's
[1:35:50] i got two bathrooms big open space in
[1:35:52] the middle and
[1:35:53] but anyway um so
[1:35:56] it looks like that i'm still keeping my
[1:35:59] eyes on that one
[1:36:00] so um so just keep that in prayer if you
[1:36:03] would
[1:36:04] and um and we'll just i'll just let you
[1:36:07] know during the week
[1:36:09] war will be next next uh next sunday
[1:36:12] brother dennis have been talking to
[1:36:14] somebody out on wrightstown road
[1:36:16] if y'all know where right town road is
[1:36:18] it's halfway between here in new mexico
[1:36:22] that is offering us one of their
[1:36:24] buildings at their church
[1:36:26] to go into so we'll see we'll see what
[1:36:29] the lord does so
[1:36:30] i appreciate you coming to be here today
[1:36:32] but uh
[1:36:33] uh appreciate him most of all yes so
