TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] morning things have said that in a while I mean a good morning part since we've had evening service systems we've started the church here for past four years or so now a little over four years but good morning to you welcome to the first church service live we've had it in three months hard to believe some in some ways it seems like it's been longer than that in some ways it seems like shorter but very thankful to be back in the house of the Lord again and you know everywhere that God has two or three or gathered I consider the house of the Lord so I believe there's more than that of us here today all as obvious you can see there's still little kinks and things we have to work out to get this or we'd like it to be not that we're gonna be here forever I just Lord willing plan on having this little place here is a temporary place for us just maybe for a few weeks he with the Lord supplies when I felt the Lord to try to find something that we could definitely have this is the first place the Lord brought woman was here I felt to come over here and this was with all the hotels here this is the first place - Lord sent me - I went to the other hotels but there wasn't anything there there was a process Jean at the Days Inn there was a much smaller a little about half the size of this room and it was 150 dollars so that didn't work the sizes or the price really we could have made the price but the size just wasn't going to work and went to the Red Roof down here and they weren't renting theirs out so anyway just this the first place that came was the place that the Lord wanted us so here we are thank thankful to the Lord for that they've been looking diligently at places around around town trying to find something that would soon and would work in a good area and the price range and everything and something more permanent I'm figuring if the Lord's moved us out of the place we were then there's got to be something more permanent something that he wants us to be in that's going to be ours so that's kind of that's really what my aim and goal is I've had a couple of suggestions of other churches to maybe rent to us take their facility when off times but under the current circumstances we can do that and that that would be fine I just you know we've been doing that for four years I just feel like if we're moving on then let's just move on and move to a place again that's more permanent and the place that we can call ours we can set things up the way we'll want them and just have them that way and to be a church obese just for us we come in there and just everything that happens the spirits and also just be a different situation scenario so but I'm very happy and thankful to be here today trying to give Michael a little time to play with the piano over there appreciate exactly Tabitha bringing their piano here but Zack didn't warn me a couple of key stuck so Micah's trying to work on that a little bit but we're thankful to be here today appreciate the Lord's blessings to us let's just stand to our feet we'll open our service in prayer just invite the president's Lord Jesus having this service as I wrote to you yesterday in faith trust the Lord is gonna bless us to be with us and comfort us I have some I want to say but I want to say it during the message so and then for those who are watching and streaming and those who may get this that are a part of our congregation I have Mike to turn the cameras off I got some personally I want to talk to you about that I do not want to be on YouTube or the internet or for anyone else to hear but because I believe it's a word the Lord gave for me to you so I'm gonna record it for those who aren't here today for them to be able to get a copy but the Lord willing towards the end here so let's just bow our heads now if we could by his presence Lord Jesus father we're very thankful God again and lord did you give us a place to come that you give us a place to assemble a place that we call a church a place that we can come in out in the world and we can gather together more with those of like precious faith as you admonished us even that or as that they approaches Lord that we gather together father and we're here together in faith believing the God you're gonna watch over us and you're gonna protect us and keep us safe Lord we know that you had job hedged about Lord and that you protected him and kept him from all the wiles in the evil and Lord we know how you who could say you could only get to job when you let down the hedge more but we're believing that your holy angels are encamped around about us today father and that you're keeping us safe and watching over us and blessing this service lord I pray that you bless each one that come today Lord may you bless those that may be on the stream hook up here now and just pray God that your Holy Spirit would have the preeminence more than all that is said and done Lord we don't want to take for granted God what you do for us what you've given to us how you blessed us so Lord thought during the time where people are in great turmoil Lord and somewhere without jobs and money and Lord uh the food Food lines are just lined up Lord and my god you blessed us and you've kept us and you helped keep us healthy and strong and prosperous Lord for you now Lord may we take the blessings that you give us and turn it around Lord and not just give you praise and glory and honor and worship for what you've done for us Lord but Lord said let our purpose on life God be shown may it be may you be glorified and everything that we do and say in every purpose Lord that we have when just committed to you we rebuke every demonic spirit that may try to infiltrate hinder or hurt this service in any way they got this place this time these four walls God for the glory and honor of the Lord Jesus Christ each one come here today are representatives of yours God for your glory and honor so God may you get the glory honor and praise of all that said and done here today cuz we committed and given into your hands father we thank you God for all you've done for us and just looking forward to what you continue to do you've given us another day God to preach or word another day to spread that word around the world and wherever you would take us and send us and whoever you'd have us talk to and witness to and whatever purpose you have father another day that we can live for you God let us not take this day for granted let it let us not take the next breath we have for granted but give it to you with all that we have within us father is serve you with fervor and zeal Lord we just give you thanks and praise Lord and pray your Holy Spirit would have preeminence now on this service that you would be glorified and magnified and all that we say and do may what we do now be pleasing to you may you find favour with our little group here God as we've assembled this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you it can be seated if you'd like and we just have a few songs song service we won't be too long this morning the Lord willing but we do what we also want to be obedient to the Lord and what the Lord has for us today so amen let's turn over in song number 426 I've had a textbook that said they're getting sound with no video even we're trying to stream this - I mean there's quite a few people that weren't going to be able to make it this morning so we want him to continue to stream that and wanted to also give the levity to those who didn't feel like they should be in a group of people yet you know I think the I think one of the worst things that would come of this situation like I said in my last message and please I apologize for not having a midweek sermon this week but the one previous you know the devil could use this to try to drive a wedge and to bring differences into dis unifying God's people and try to make it dis against that and if you don't do this you don't do that and you know the worst thing you can do is is for those who and I'm just gonna say it bluntly but for those who wear masks to look down on the people that don't and for those who don't [Music] [Music] I thought it would be more comfortable to you as a group at least the majority would just continue to screaming so we just found a good compromise we got a place where and we're streaming so god bless you on the streaming in gov su 491 let's turn over there amen so glad to be together at the end day then Lord knows how much the little folks [Music] one homelessness a great expectation [Music] Purcell monster trade of me [Music] back to the top down [Music] amen when I came in at first all this place and I saw the lectern s will raise the Lord I have a little bit more of a full head like but I thought there'd be a shelf here there's nothing to put anything on and I haven't sang like this for a while so forgive me but I'm worshiping the Lord a man 361 appreciated roses 361 and we'll see this one more before we go to the Lord in prayer we bring the sacrifice of praise amen we bring that sacrifice of praise I got challenged one time about with somebody about the Old Testament New Testament oh we don't go by the Old Testament I said I absolutely do simple do you still sacrifice us in absolutely every time I wake up I sacrifice praise to the Lord every day I don't take an animal and slit his throat down two thousand square but I worship the Lord and offer up my sacrifice to praise the Lord Jesus amen that's what we come here to do today let's see it [Music] and the Roberts had quite a emotional physical drain and it's real need a prayer so please remember whether Robert I considered brother Robert Robert and brother Dana men of God yes and love them hold him up and not bending Roberts handful of times to preach for him and I wanted to have him up here sometime had had got to that point yet but just please remember him in prayer if you would also that request a prayer from brother angel angel had let me know last night in Priscilla that there her sister tested positive for Kovac 19 last night and they had been around her sister and they have been around the family and things like that so it doesn't mean they contracted it but they decided to stay home as a result today so please remember them in prayer probably now they're going to be tested as a result so please remember that family and prayers angel that ask that request prayer for their whole family and of course for his immediate family I think I'll just read this part but he said I'm also asking prayer for my family because we are being attacked by the enemy and I want the enemy to leave and provide to fill our home entirely with him alone I'm also asking prayer for God to help my children during these trying times to fill them and sealed it with the with the taupe and the Holy Ghost I'm also asking God to bring each one of them closer to him and make them in the likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ also restore their peace and love in their hearts he said the reason I'm asking is the enemy is physically showing himself and letting his presence known and it was affecting every so they're also well today to deal with the pain and now she doesn't have it and she's just in bed constantly for the last 2 or 3 days that she's been home and she's just in tremendous pain so he decided to save the day to take care of her god bless him and we need to pray for him he's a new Christian when he was we meet at the patio at the housing complex where we are and the Lord when we pray for him my friend Dominic is a the Holy Spirit gallery and and so the Holy Spirit Archie came on Derrick and you could see his chest flush and he just something like just flew out and he just and he just and so he you know he's been serving God I got him a mobile Bible and he can he wanted to come this morning but he he was being faithful to his mother so there's a lot of pain there we need to pray for him he's gone back to smoking cigarettes out left in one but back to smoking and I realized there's a problems there that we need to pray for him to even that I think it calms him down and he needs a lot of calming down and so he walks a lot to try to get rid of the excess energy so I think that's the reason he does it so his so we just need to pray for him he's got neurological issues so I asked him today and for them it's good to have you go by Dom or Dominic okay well come over there the other day to see you but really but it's good to meet you today though you know it might have been just with Derek Oh was it was good to have you with us today okay let's stand to our feet if we're good Donoghue thank you

we get to the other side oh my you know I just said and thinking and studying on the message today yesterday and just something hit me I started to get a glimpse than the thought of you know because I believe if we get on the other side it's gonna be the hardest is I got and God loves his children he wants to give their hearts desire and you know he said if we delight ourselves in him he would give us our heart's desire and believe more so we get on the other side and I started getting a glimpse of what it might what what my cabin my place of abode or whatever you want to call it and that new cities gonna look like and you know what made me think about when brother Branham used to talk about me we've got his little cabin down by the river and he says you hear him singing about the blood of Jesus or something he said old brother bill made it and marries the Lord you can do the same again it just comes in such plain view to think all what a day it'll be what a place it is the Lord has already said he's prepared for us amen that wonderful place praise the Lord Jesus anyone have a quick testimony now real quick now in just a couple minutes I don't want to be too long today we only have a certain length of time room two so a man just yes sister mentees well those of you who have seen bright Hill if you're watching online I know any Joel and Priscilla have seen it that one the bride has no I yes day before yesterday I went Friday excuse me was about two or three days ago I went to a stop sign it's free and in the afternoon and I just happened to look at Brian Hale it was on Nikki and I think it was a Latoya and I happen to look over and her eye was open God gave her an eye there's never been an eye there and it was flaming it was one eye it was open the bride is a week and her eye was flaming like brother branham's eyes were flaming when he went up that Matthew told Billy Paul this is the hour I've told you about this this is it and there it was like this there's white formations underneath her nostrils I've never seen them before and it looked like white mucus coming out of her nose and I realized the talk with Tom about this and I realized this is the seal of the hour that the Holy Spirit in us bringing us to repentance looking for that last little piece under the bed sweeping the house looking for it everywhere that we can this is not a time to be playing praise the Lord that's some true things we're going home maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe next week maybe next year maybe ten years from now but we're going home ready to go home amen do you want to else real quick I don't but I mean we've been going through a lot past three months I thought maybe you have if you have something to share I don't want to stop you so okay um daddy knows but my car has been a little past I have a check engine light on got a hole puncher like $3,500 with the repairs done to it and now about six months nine months later the lights on lights are flashing on the dashboard my tire was flat and all kinds of stuff going on I want to thank God for holding the tire up I waited too long to get new tires but I was waiting for finances to do so but it would get down to life flat flat and tire was falling apart there was no tread left but the Lord kept it good enough to where I could drive to the gas station pump it up and then keep going about my day coming to church and going to their house for streaming and whatnot and the engine light will come on and I'll just review kit and then go and then five days later I'll come back on and I'll rebuke it and so lord I need you touch this I don't want to spend $2,000 to fix something again it's a 2004 so in this great hole it'll go off again and five days later come back on I'll just keep rebuking it I want to thank God for keeping the car man praise the Lord master mechanic it's not just a healer friend easy our bodies he is a healer of every disease in the ailment my cart door will just erase the might and say he will be clarity anybody else Amen god bless you today again welcome you appreciate your being here today we're going to stand to our feet now and go to the Word of God turn our Bibles if you would with me to Genesis chapter 3 I had mentioned to you on one of the videos excuse me there's so many of that just running together the stream in the ones who did it like this the midweeks someone kind of run together that I've mentioned to you that I was going to plan when we started meeting live like this again to continue on the crisis of mystery God to reveal to the mysteries of God in Christ as I titled it and I wanted to continue forward from that from the revelation point that we had talked about the last message we spill spoke on that but the other day in prayer I felt really compelled to bring this message today so we all know who the enemy is tactus the enemy reminding us of the tactics of the enemy and so I want to approach that thought today if we could you know it just it's a subject that's very felt very seldom ever talked about but Lord willing we'll just get into it here but this let's bow our heads for word of prayer there before we before read the Word of God Lord Jesus we thank you Father I feel so inspired of a heart right now Lord and just ready to bring this word you gave to me and Lord to give to your people and just trust that your Holy Spirit is going to speak through these lips the words you have us to hear Lord let it fall into of each one of our hearts Lord God believing that this truth of your word Lord comes to us to recognize the day and the hour that we live there's a lot going on father there's a lot of disruption there's a lot of disturbance there's a lot of need Lord there's not of there's a lot of people in the Father we're just believing that God you're going to speak to us and help us recognize the truth in your word Lord of where we are in that word of what part we play in that word of what it means to us God Lord I'm thankful father for these that have come today I'm very thankful for those that are streaming Lord and watching and and I'm appreciative too for those who will watch maybe at a later date but God we're thankful to be here to have this place and have you present with us so Lord may your Holy Spirit Lord break forth this word to us not just by words not just by the letters but reveal to us in here what you'd have us to see and though we give you thanks and praise for it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen now Genesis chapter 3 I'll just read two verses to you when we go back to verse 1 of course we feed on this a highlights of different points of time but let's go to verse 6 and 6 and 7 and we'll let you be seated and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat the eyes of them both were opened they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons you can be seated if you like now now again the the point of this that I want to make is of course the tactics of the enemy and the devices of the devil and the time that we're living today and there's a lot going on is there's a tack of the enemy on every side and you know as well as I do that I wanted to bring this out but before I get into this but you know as well as I do as as soon as you try to now hold this is because we know this but when it gets into reality sometimes that we forget about it or we lose it but but understanding that that when you when you work to try to make a step towards God the sate is gonna it's not going to let just you let that go Satan's going to be there to try to pound you every chance you get the the closer you get to the doors of the kingdom the closer you get to God the closer you come to making that relationship with Jesus Christ the more artillery Satan is going to fire in your direction he's going to try to turn your attention and different things and try to get you distracted and try to pull you away from what you know is the truth from what you know it's real from what you know this Bible this word this message is the truth say he's going to try to pull you away he's going to try to bombard you with everything he's got a lot of times the biggest mistake people have when they come in Christianity they think they're coming into this great wonderful flower tea bed of ease if you know all your problems are going to be solved then everything's going to be perfect and you're just gonna ride and crest every wave and it just doesn't work that way because as a Christian we give our lives to the Lord and the Lord allows things to happen to test us to make sure that we are firm in what we know and what we believe in who we are if we don't know that it's like kinda like the pressure message for each a couple weeks ago if we don't know that if it's not settled in our hearts then when the real test does come that they will falter failing and and fall back that happens to many people how many people you probably know personally that just went along for a long time we're doing wonderful and and great then all of a sudden something happens and shakes their faith and they just don't know what to do and and sometimes they even use the verbage god help but they use the verbage I don't know where to turn if you're a Christian friend you don't know where to turn you're not a Christian a Christians know where to turn because there's only one place to turn to because when that artillery starts coming in and try to bring doubt and try to see the division and try to dis unifying all these great bombs get locked at you all these problems you said well I never had these problems when I wasn't serving God well of course not the devil had you all right he wasn't he wasn't disrupting your life the disruption of life comes when you're serving God the closer you get to him the more disruption there is we know that we've had prayer requests and things from people that's gone forth and and things that's happened in lives and you you know if some of those things has happened and it's gone through with prayer requests even sister Julia included a lot of you as a part of a text last week of the situation she'd been going through and you know it just shows that when you're when you're moving towards the Lord and when you're trying to do something you feel God is leading you to do Satan's not gonna let that go he's going to continue to love those those those bombs in your area you look around you think you've crossed over and all of a sudden there's bombs are all around you will understand friends we're in the middle of a warfare this is a warfare this is the battleground and world Satan Zenon's ground so if we're in the middle of this battle we're in the middle of this war now it's not the time to doubt now it's not the time to sow seed of discord now it's not the time to pull away because remember what does the pressure do the pressure either draws you closer into Christ or it drives you further away and when someone says they don't know where to turn you're driving further away when what we should be doing is getting closer to God so God I don't understand it I might not be able to figure it out or why're we always have second question why but lord I trust you you've never failed me you've always been there you've never failed me so I trust you Lord in family regardless I know this is the truth I know you weren't real I know this message is right but now look as we go back to the scripture let's get into Genesis chapter 3 for a minute and let's go back to verse 1 Genesis Trika chapter 3 verse 1 and see because this this is after God's creation and God has brought Adam along and and he's created and made a woman for him a hell pain and and now we've got a beautiful place just think of it just imagine when you become a Christian or even last week you've been a Christian for forty years but last week you're in the middle of this beautiful barnaby God's created that garden for you it's a beautiful place you seem like nothing to go wrong everything is right everything is beautiful everything's filled with joy and a bird singing and rainbows and life is good right garden to me and he's had a Garden of Eden experience good man and you feel like you're in the middle of Garden of Eden and all of a sudden here comes a bomb that you weren't expecting well that's what's happened they're in the middle of this beautiful Garden of Eden but that beautiful Garden of Eden is about to be disrupted God does everything for a purpose remember fragrance we spoke one joke before but God had job hedged remember that God had job hence Satan couldn't even touch Joe cuz he went to God God God says why have you considered Joe Satan said I can't even get to him you've got an edge I can't touch him God says ok let down the hedge and I'll prove to you that he belongs to me no matter what you do to him he's going to clean that much closer to me and God lowered the hedge Satan attacked him and then more Satan attacked in the closer job got to go oh let that be our testimony the more Satan might attack you just get that much closer to God just just Nussle up next to MZ he's that breasted one that we that we receive nourishment and strength from and you just muscled up next to God don't let all the distractions and all the things in the world take over that just come just click take that and just clean that much closer to God it's all happening for a reason but now the Garden of Eden there's a bomb about to be unleashed God's allowing the Satan to influence the serpent the closest one to the human race remember the link between the monkey and the man the place that the evolutionists cannot find because they can't find that link they can't prove evolution as a fact because of that lent missing link well we know where that missing link is he's crawling around his belly every fiber of his being has changed from the curse in the Garden of Eden that's why we can't find him but now the influence of Satan upon the serpent has brought this bomb into the Garden of Eden now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made now God made this serpent of course God made Lucifer which became safe the devil God made every beast of the field God made the serpent he was upright more like a man only seed that could cross with the woman of course it couldn't be with that with the animal I forgot now the only one that could cross over only seed that could mix with the woman so Satan found an instrument that he could work in and remember Satan is always going to find an instrument that he can work in understand don't be that instrument god help you don't ever be that instrument but Satan is always going to have an instrument that he can work in and the instruments he tries to work in the most are those of influence those who are influential positions namely pastors great amen a lot of times you won't hear things preached especially in the nominal world today about the devil and the devices of Satan because everything is again ranked those puppy-dog tails and everything is good you are wonderful and you are great and the grass is green and the sky is blue and you're just prosperous and you know that that's what you get that but so much of it all the time which is I don't want to say anything negative about anybody but is that that's not reality people like to hear those kinds of things if the positivity is fine we should all be positive a friend there's a devil out there that wants to drive you with him to a burning hell rate and that is a reality that we all must recognize but the devices of the devil see the serpent was more subtil now we know what the word subtil I've mentioned to you probably a couple of times but if you bear with me to give the definition the subtool if you go back in the Hebrew you recognize that that word subtil this put in there means shrewd crafty slime beguiling we understand that she he beguiled Eve he was sly he was shrewd even even in Scofield notes he talked about her brother and said this too but talked about how the serpent was probably a very beautiful creature and you think well how would you know the serpent would be a beautiful creature because of the beguiling abilities that he had to seduce Eve not to mention the fact that after he was cursed you can see him slithering around on his belly now every movement he really makes is very graceful many of them have colored very beautiful I've seen some very beautiful snakes although I didn't cut their heads off they keep a try so that's a good thing but anyway their movements are beautiful a lot of times their colors are beautiful you see one of the most deadliest snakes when he gets riled up he'll jump up and his is the Cobra ice you look at it and thing from the back hand fronts a beautiful animal beautiful reptile creature well that's just a signification of what it was in the Garden of Eden when God cursed him down there on the ground it changed every Faculty of his beings he he couldn't he could talk when he was the serpent in the Garden of Eden he could communicate with Eve but he could not communicate now so every part of every part of that was changed but now as this beautiful subtool beguiling individual sly crude crafty but again the word that I found a couple years ago that struck me the strongest when I first looked at this was the word sensible the word sensible and subtool it to me would identify the serpent as much as the crude slime crafty part because what he offered and what Satan is offering today sounds to the common ear to the human mind as something that makes sense drink I don't know how many times I've said this but we don't look for things that make sense a lot of times things that make sense to the human mind are things that are contrary to God a lot of times the things that don't make any sense are things that is godly I mean you make sense to one day being ready to eat not with cancer and the next minute you don't have cancer at all to be seen in your body what sense is there in that there is none what sense is there in you coming here today and listening to this lump of clay up here speaking to you today what sense does that make it makes no sense to the common man to the natural minded it's not sensible but it's sensible to not God instituted it that way to bring his word so how do they know unless they err hear the word and how do they hear the word without a preacher that's God's Way and how much sense did it make for Adam and Eve to fall in the Garden of Eden and God's rid the resolution God's remedy was to kill two lambs and throw the sheep skin in for them to wear made more sense for them to take fig leaves which I've become way more acutely aware of recently because of my wife's desire for figs in the trees at the zika's house I begin to really see what these fig leaves really look like more so and and I can see it think that would create a good covering it says apron but it just means covering a place that would that would cover to sew together to join together now that made more sense than taking a couple animals and killing them why would you do that because there had to be a sacrifice to meet the sin the sin was a blood hemoglobin sin and the sacrifice had to be a blood hemoglobin sacrifice when Jesus came and gave his blood that blood of man of a perfect male was June was to annihilate the original sin which was a blood transfer a semen transfer it wasn't a fruit or a an apple or apricot er or a fig or something they ate it was a relationship we know that and the sacrifice had to make the sin but to the natural eye it doesn't make any sense no sense so let me help me get past this point so something that is sensible many times because because I not used the phrase all a lot oh that makes sense mmm oh that makes sense well that's fine when it comes to something of a world or something that you're trying to learn or something to enhance your intelligence or something so well that makes sense that fits there yeah okay that makes sense that's fine nothing wrong with that but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the things of God and we're talking about the things of God we draw a strap strike contrast between the things of God and the things of the world the things that we learned that the things that we see taste feel smeller here is a different situation we draw a very stark contrast between the two we're talking about God now and you're talking about godly things it's not always that that's sensible right because what seems to be right to God is wrong to man and what is right to man is wrong to not we know that's a scripture I mean I paraphrase a little bit but that's that's the Bible it doesn't make sense to us it's probably God if it doesn't make sense to if it doesn't work with God then it probably makes sense to man and that's the track that Men goes off on that's the way they go with it that's why so many people leave the message then they think oh well what well that makes sense well yeah well I never knew that before oh well is it coming to you by knowledge or is it be coming to you about revelation let's continue to read now the serpent we've established was more sensible crude crafty sensible then the Lord got it mate and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now that's the first trick of the devil to sow doubt sowing doubt is the first trick of the devil it's the first in the trinity of the deception of Satan that's the first to get it out first thing if Satan's ever going to get a hold of you he has to cause you first to doubt to get you to doubt what you believe to get you to doubt what you've known your whole life for most your life or whatever the scenario is doubt that's the first thing he does and that's what Satan is doing to eat now Eve knows the word because her husband told her he Adam told her that what God said now the fact that Adam told her did not make it any less the Word of God if I tell you something God give to me as a revelation through the word message whatever it doesn't make it any less of the word or any less truth by my relaying that to you as it was when it came to me or if you witness to somebody is no less a word to somebody as it was when he came to you or to me so when Adam got it he got it fresh from God remember the voice of the Lord the Bible says the voice of the Lord will read it the minute walk with Adam in the garden in the cool of the day no doubt what they talked about God told Adam we could read it here that God told Adam you can either the fruits of the tree of the bar but don't eat the fruit of this in the midst of the tree now we know trees represent people in the Bible the Med so on but that deception came through doubt that's what he tried to get her to doubt now again I'm bringing this to us to refresh us and help us remember and remind us when these things are going on it's just the device isn't the enemy yes it's just Satan trying to draw you away it's just Satan trying to defeat you to get you away from what is true and what is real the first thing he uses in his Trinity of deception is to get you to down yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden you notice the question mark at the end of that sentence that question mark means it's a question he's asking her which is showing in her mind the seed of doubt oh they God really say this now she says the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she die now is that the truth that's absolutely the truth that's exactly what God told Adam and no doubt exactly what Adam told Eve so what did Eve have at this moment did you have a knowledge of what Adam told her or did she have a revelation of what God told Adam understand let me say that again did she have a knowledge of what Adam told her or did she have a revelation of what God told Adam see there's a big difference there it's subtle but it's big difference if she simply had a knowledge of what Adam told her all she had was knowledge but if she had a revelation of what God told Adam then she had something that changed her life that become a part of her that she could not doubt many times I give you the I'm not a Chinese woman I lived the life of a white male I've said that to you many times that's the greatest description I know of revelation I can't doubt I can't deny I live the life of a Chinese woman because I'm a white man understand so if God's revealed something to you and you know it's right you can't go off of that because you know it's just a part of who you are when somebody tries to bring something contrary to you no matter how sensible it may sound you know it's wrong right because God has already revealed to you the truth so is she speaking to the serpent a knowledge of Adam's message to her a revelation of what God told to Adam which of course then told her obviously she's speaking of simply the fact that Adam told her this is what it is now what she said is no less the Word of God understand whether it's my knowledge of Revelation is no less the Word of God it's still the Word of God amen even spoke by the devil which will maybe hopefully Lord willing we'll get to in a few minutes even if spoken by the devil himself it's still the word God it's still the Word of God so it's still the Word of God but the difference is cheese has simply a knowledge of what her husband told her rather than a revelation of what God told out you see that was that was Cain enables problem - that was Cain's problem what bagels brother Abel had a revelation not simply knowledge Cain had a knowledge of what of what was told to it not a revelation man Hebrews 11 says enabled by revelation by faith faith is a revelation offered to God a more excellent sacrifice it was revealed to him that it wasn't fig leaves but it was it was of knowledge by Cain that it was Bakke life fruits vegetables leaves whatever because that's what Adam and he tried to do in the beginning they tried this so fig leaves together to try to hide their nakedness from who from each other I mean they've already been joined together as one so who are they sewing fig leaves together I mean just animals around who are these sewing fig leaves together the hide themselves from there's only one that's right right they're only trying to hide themselves from God because they've realized that they were naked well shall I say the same thing brother madam said sixty years ago if Apple's made women realize they're naked it's time to pass the apples again because they're out on the streets naked again but let's continue on revelation or knowledge now she having knowledge obviously because she repeated God's Word the way that it was given to Adam but now the second part of the Trinity of Satan's deception and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now every part of that is the word except for one part one word not God said ye shall surely die the serpent said ye shall not surely die so what's he done he's caused her to doubt first that's the first thing he comes to you it's always going to make you to doubt second thing is he's going to try to hide read the word he's going to try to take the word which most of you know all of us here I believe know is the truths it's God in letter form he's gonna take that and hydrate it from what you know is the truth from what God has give to you as the truth he's gonna hide read it by taking the word itself and make it say something that it doesn't actually say God said you will die the serpent said you shall not die so his first thing is to get you to doubt his second thing is to hybrid the word to make the word say something it doesn't say now that's a lot of the pitfalls that a lot of people fall into today a lot of Ministers they said well I don't doubt the word but how can you not doubt the word when you feel you have to bring your word or your version or your hybrid idea of what the word says if a person has two hybrid the word to make it say what they wanted to say or fit their own lives you don't believe the word you'd have to doubt the word two hybrid people will say I believe the word but then they'll preach what a seminary teaches they'll preach what a denomination teaches they'll preach what somebody comes to the contrary to the word they'll say that's hybrid then you don't believe the word our our spiritual growth is not based on your knowledge of Revelation or doctrine your spiritual growth is based on obedience to Christ in your relationship with him not how much you know not how much knowledge you gain but how close are you to the Lord what is your relationship with him that's the that's the spiritual that's where our spiritual growth comes from see now we've got the second part of the Trinity of Satan's deception it's right here the Garden of Eden he said well I thought his Trinity was Father Son Holy Ghost it is that's the titles evil spirits travel and the titles of Father Son Holy Ghost not Lord Jesus Christ in the Trinity of Satan in the Garden of Eden first is is doubt second is is hybrid now where does he go from there you can probably see you shall not surely die fifth verse now for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be God's knowing good and evil now was he right he absolutely was right what he just told her is exactly what happened he was right but it wasn't God's gospel it wasn't what God gave it wasn't God's Word it was serpents were so first he caused doubt second he calls hybrid ation of the word third he brings his own gospel in now he's got a new gospel to her and buy that new gospel she's accepted that new gospel cause first she doubted she had to doubt or she would have acted on it she would've either if there was no doubt you wouldn't even entertain it because you know it's not true sorry she had to doubt and she had to listen to the high predation of the word you shall not surely die which had 95 90 plus percent work to it all just one word just one word friends you shall not surely die hybrid a hybrid the word so now after she he's God rid the place of hydrating the word just manipulating what part of it now he brings his own message he's got her in position to receive his word by causing her to doubt and hydrating the word now she's in position to receive his message what was his message to get her to have relation with him God does know in the day ether of your eyes shall be opened he shall be as God's knowing good and evil that's his message it was true remember Lucifer was God's right-hand man it was true but it wasn't what God gave them what God gave them was don't touch it or you're gonna die period there was no caveat to it there was no exception there was no buts or maybes there was do it and death that's what God said period now people want to fool around with that and say well yeah but what about this and you know I think gods are loving God and yeah he is a loving God but he's not a dirty grandpa there that's not gonna honor his word he God expects us to live by his word and the judgment of that word befall those who do not so he said now we've got the Trinity see the Trinity of Satan's deception doubt hybrid new message that's exactly now after she received the new message what does she do just like anybody that receives a if you receive a new message that you really believe you really give credence to that message what's the first thing you do you have gone amen that's what a lot of people are doing that today in the streets of this country they've received a message and they're acting on it they're out in the streets they're acting on what the message was when you receive a message that you really believe the first thing you do is act on it when you become a Christian and you really believe that this was the way to live and this was pleasing to the Lord and this is what you wanted your life to be what did you do you acted upon it Peter said repent you repented be baptized we're baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and praise God hopefully 100 jeev that point what is you you've acted on and then after you got it you went to church and you lived your life as a godly life you witness to other people you wanted others to to receive what you've got you wanted others to to have what you had you acted upon that that's just normal I mean even in the world of business if somebody come to someone and let's just say for a moment that that a Warren Buffett came and you have the utmost confidence in Warren Buffett and he's been like the master of Wall Street his whole life but he's a multi-millionaire so obviously the man knows what he's doing is that he'd come and he'd give you some advice and said you should buy this so-and-so and stop he's so I you know I don't know I don't think I want to do that you got the money you got the time you can do it but you think it all well you know I don't know you know it's not that big deal with me I don't really wanted to do that you know the next day the stocks up 10 bucks next day it's up 30 bucks next day it's a hundred bucks you're like oh why didn't I do that you know a lot of times people do do that but most of the time if you receive something from something you truly believe and you revere and you hold up you act upon it if you were to get something you know is a surefire thing or something you know it's gonna be right you do something about it you act on it that's what he did she received Satan's new message through the serpent and she acted upon it the sixth verse when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that was pleasant to the eye and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof she had a relationship with a serpent and did eaten gave also unto her husband with her and he did he remember this the Bible says that she was to see but he wasn't he went out to take her and became sin for her that God wouldn't kill her God would have had to kill him to kill her just like Satan just like us you mean Jesus did the same thing for his bride we were racked in sin headed to hell faster than the Gentile people could head but Jesus Christ came along and he stepped forward and he embraced his bride and he took her into his bosom and he took their place so that he/she could become him now we stand in his righteousness because of the price that he paid for us and embracing us into himself now we become as he is now God can't destroy this US bride sinners as we were degradable desert ale we're never gonna see hell because he's Jesus step forward remember revelation five took the book redeemed all it was his now when God looks at you he doesn't see that sin he sees the blood of Jesus he sees the sacrifice because the sacrifice my friend is still there that blood is still there making intercession for us praise the Lord just like Adam did in the Garden of Eden Adam went out and embraced his wife and took her into his bosom had relation with her such a relation the serpent and Adam both had a child come forth from her came enabled he took her to himself see he did take and they both knew that they were naked see seven persons the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made a made themselves aprons it's the exact same thing people try to do today they try to hide behind religion they try to hide behind a botany life something that's sensible not God's provided way God has a provided way friend and that's the only way that's going to get us to him that's the only way this one excuse us from this world in line for sin it's not doing it the way we want to do it like many people I would try to tell you today you are your own God though you're not we are he is and we belong to you in ourselves in ourselves God has made us a part of him to speak and name just like in the Garden of Eden but we're not God amen but they did what they thought was right they tried to hide themselves and they heard the now listen here we go now and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day the voice of the Lord Adam and his wife hid themselves from presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden now the question here is why are they hiding themselves amongst the trees of the garden did they not already just so fig leaves together to hide their nakedness well if they saw the fig leaves to hide their nakedness why they go into the trees to hide themselves aren't they already covered see this is the son of God were talking about this is the first created son of God Adam that we're talking about he knew although the best he can do at the time was the fig leaves he knew that was not sufficient in coming into the presence of God he knew that that wasn't gonna was going to suffice for what God's law required was a lot of time but what God's Word required he knew it wasn't he was a son of God he knew it wasn't sufficient so he knew that they would still have to go in and try to hide themselves or separate themselves apart from the holy God because now they had transgressed his word and they had fallen from grace so they're dividing themselves from the presence of God hiding themselves in the trees of the garden which of course a lot of people do that in church - you know again people represents trees and the Bible represents people you know a lot of people come to church and though you know try to do the acts and play the part and they'll try to just hide amongst the trees kind of hard to do in a congregation like we've got we don't have enough trees to hide but a lot of people try to find big churches no boat unless on the back pew or something now try to hide themselves and they'll say oh I went to church today did you really probably not they probably didn't and hide themselves among the trees and they just become a part of it they scoot in this go down that's all it is to them but there's no place you can hide the God doesn't find the Lord called up to Adam and said unto Him where art dominance of course one of the most outstanding parts of the scripture where are now you mean you are almighty omnipotent all-knowing infinite God you don't know where Adam is of course he knew where Adam was he wanted to know if Adam knew where he was that's that that's my take God wanted Adam to know Adam do you know where you are do you know what you've done do you know what you have called do you know what situation and circumstance you find yourself in now where are you he's not God's not God's not a blind man in a dark room trying to find a black cat he knows where Adam was I mean people would read this part of the scripture like God saying Oh out of work could you possibly be Adam oh where I can't find you are you playing peek-a-boo with me today I can't that's not God we're talking about an almighty all-powerful omnipotent all-knowing unchanging it for my God how is he not gonna know where Adam is he knows exactly where Adam is he wants Adam to know out of where are you what have you done what have you caused do you know where you're standing now you know what's gonna have to happen now because I told you the moment you did this that we would be separated told you that as soon as you did it be school of the dog these cool to evening walks within you knew that there would be a great chasm that would separate God and man until the supreme sacrifice came you knew that this was gonna happen where are you let me move on and he heard and he said I heard thy voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself again he already covered himself from his nakedness right so to think leaves together but he still knew that that wasn't enough he knew his nakedness bear open before the Lord now it wasn't just a physical nakedness right now it's a spiritual nakedness and he said who told you that that was naked as thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should it's not either man said the woman whom thou gave us to me with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat now it's time to pass the book you know that's what happens a lot of times you know probably the worst part that that happens is politics today you know some little thing goes wrong and this one oblate mountain and that want to blame a pond that won't align that one and you know the problem is we're all at fault whole systems at fault but they want to put a bandaid on a broke and you've got to find out what caused the broke leg to start with not just put a bandaid on it well how'd you break your leg well I did this we're gonna do that again how did you break your ankle I jumped off the roof of the house we don't do that again you won't break rank like that again right right well that's the same thing happens today they said well this happened well how'd it happen well then don't do that again but everybody was passed above well this one did this you know Adam says well the woman you gave me and the woman's like well the serpent beguiled me and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go cuz he was not a recently on his belly does shall be the shop out eat all the days of my life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed proving again the serpent had his seed produced in the of the man came a man who was the Bible says was of that wicked one amen between I see her she is your Bruce ahead bruises heal now that's the subtlety of the enemy the cunningness of the of the devil the Trinity of The Devil's deception get you two down hybrid the word that you know it's true and then bring a new gospel that's exactly the only way a seminary a church minister denomination could do anything like that is first get people to either withhold the Bible which they used to do in old times the Catholic Church used to just hold this Bible back and not give it to the common people for them to read first you just it would hold it from them so they don't have it to read at all or you try to get them to say well that's not exactly what it means right well that's not exactly what it says and lord have Saints I don't know the Lord how many actually variations of the Bible are there today and how many interpretations how many what's the word I'm trying to go home you have in your mind somebody translations of the Bible are there today there's probably hundreds of translations when all we need is the one that God originally came to us amen all we need is the one that you give to us begin with but you looking oh they trying to figure it out they try to make this and hyper distant and then what they had well you're not a Catholic unless you take communion but she let you take the uterus and all this like taking the Holy Spirit well you can't be a bad just unless you're baptized in the name of Father the Father Son the Holy Ghost so we you can't be a Methodist about whatever they all have their own little things as they go by that that's their doctrine that's their dogma and they all wind this up they're all winding this up today oh lord help me this later they're all winding this up today in the World Council of Churches just hold on for a minute because I want to get more to that I found something out yesterday that I didn't even know but anyway look at this price of misery got revealed when evil went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church the bride goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornication with the world of man's wisdom and rejecting the authority of God's Word leave this now and faith without works is dead August 1950 the first sin that was ever committed look at this now the first sin that was ever committed and what is sin unbelief unbelief first sin first not really ever committed was doubting God's word amen there we go in the Garden of Eden chapter 3 verses one two and three doubting the word first in ever happened doubting the word is that right God said ye shall eat the day either of that day you die Satan said surely you'll not die and he gave and he got heed to doubt God's Word and to seeking knowledge is that right Amen said thinking minutes before remember Satan punts the first hole through Eve's mind of her thinking to let the taste of his wisdom and knowledge get through amen let me read this last one god of this evil age and notice he preached that kind of scientific social educated progressive gospel to eat that struck me the other day I want to go to a Matthew chapter 4 but that struck me I believe it actually was yesterday just contemplating on the Lord and thinking of the things of the Lord yesterday Sonia was gone from house running errands and I had about spot right around the time that I thought I got that vision of what the Lord has prepared on the other side that cabin or that place of abode that's looking forward to going to and I started thinking you know when when in the natural life and I want to feed off of this quote if you will if I read it again that social educated progressive gospel progressive people who's even in the message we want to say this is a progressive gospel it's not a progressive gospel God's Word is God's Word from the moment of creation even before then Jim than it is now God's words not changed God's words God's work period it's not progressive it is what I did now I may gain a more of an understanding or a revelation of it to me personally but the gospel is up the words not progressive it is what it is what's brought me to the ball you know in this country we have counterfeiters in the world not just this country but I use this country in the in this country we have counterfeiters people that try to get around earning the money from themselves and and working for it which we should do and they try to print it they've been doing this for years they they print the money well let's just get somebody that's a good artist and they'll just draw this business and we'll just make places we'll just print our own money and we'll just pass an office as the real is the genuine you know if there's a counterfeit there's got to be a real true there's a counterfeit it's got to be a real that that counterfeit came off of if the counterfeit doesn't have a real then that is the real it can't be a counterfeit if there's nothing you came off of because that would be the original or the real one there's an so if there's a counterfeit there's got to be real so if there's a real and there's a real hundred dollar bill and somebody decides that they want to print a hundred look just like the regular hundred OBO but it's not one not backed by the government or anything else not that any of the money we have is now but anyway that's beside the point they they try to make it look exactly like that dollar bill so the crook is progressive in their intelligence and in their ability to make a counterfeit look just like the real so what does the government have to do the government has to take and retool that hundred-dollar bill and change it and change the paper and the color and everything else so that it becomes harder to counterfeit but then the counterfeits get more progressive and they figure out how do we do this or how do we steal this paper how do we get and and then the government has to change the dollar bill again has to change the hundred dollar bill nobody counterfeits a dollar but a hundred dollar bill so they have to they have to figure out a different way to make the $100 bill less counterfeit able and then I started thinking but God doesn't do that God never changes the work even though there's millions of counterfeits out there today - God's Word God never changes the word God does not have to bring anything of a progressive nature on his word his word is what it is now the Bible says if this word is hid it is hid from those that are lost so if those are counterfeiting it that word for those who who received that counterfeit and believe it accept that counterfeit that means that the real was not for them to begin with they accepted received the counterfeit as it is which is of no value the $100 counterfeit bill in this world today is of no value the counterfeit gospel is of no value because it doesn't have what it doesn't have the of God and if it's counterfeit it will not have the backing of God why is a piece of paper that looks just like $100 bill but counterfeit not worth anything because it's not backed by our government of course again I don't think the real is anymore anyway but again that's beside the point the counterfeit is not backed by the government the counterfeit gospel is not backed by God it's not backed by God it's worthless out there who's preaching it I don't hear care whose mouth that's coming out of it's worthless but God doesn't have to change his two draws two counterfeiters because he knows the counterfeiters are there to throw up those that work predestinated to receive the real but if you're real and you're predestinated a counterfeit won't do a counterfeit is not good enough right if it's a counterfeit gospel there's got to be a lot of stuff made up about it a lot of stuff that they have to try to produce to manufacture to make it look like something to try to make it produce into something try to muscle up her or try to rile you up into some kind of emotion but that's not what the gospel is about the gospel is about the purity of the word of your relationship with him that's the gospel people counterfeit it but what does that produce in Matthew chapter 4 let me read this through fairly quickly because again Satan in the Garden Feed showed his Trinity of deception he does the same thing when he meets Jesus face-to-face look here now then was Jesus led up of the Spirit of the wilderness to be tempted of the devil that was the purpose of the Spirit leading Jesus into the world whom the purpose was for him to be tempted of the devil and people said I don't want to be tempted well Jesus was purposely led by the spirit and people want to say that but it's the truth but remember his will won't lead you where his grace can camp amen you may be it it may not be the easiest road to take but gotta be there wins when he had fasted forty days 40 nights he was afterward 200 and the tempter came up to him he said a gift thou be the Son of God there we go down remember the first thing he tries to do to you is to get you to doubt first thing if there's doubt coming is the devil period God doesn't cause you to kind of doubt the word Satan does if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread and when he answered him he said is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of the 13 mm of God how did he defeat the enemy with the word and then the devil taking them up into the holy city now Satan's not and he's not an idiot so look what his now God doesn't change his word ever stays the same but look at Satan trying to progress himself in his deception of Jesus the second is in the devil takes him up into the holy city set up in middle of pinnacle and Satan said unto him if thou be the Son God again he's trying to get him to down but look at what he says now cast thyself down for it is written now Satan's trying to bring a progressive gospel to try to deceive the word Jesus with the word he ups his game if you will he steps it up a bit because he realizes that Jesus is defeating him with the word so what does he counteract that with the word he says catus lights up for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the soul that's the word amen in songs jesus said unto him it is written again or it is also written thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God now this reminds me of of a snake handling church is back east you think well there's still some of those yes there are they're probably from what I know they're all in the south back east they actually literally had it's poisonous snakes in the church boxes of them and they pulled him out and they handle them to earn church service many people have been bitten and killed because of it but they actually literally do that I don't think there's many of them whether but what they do is they manipulate and they pervert God's Word like Satan just did Satan just perverted God's Word that's God's Word but he's misusing it that's like those people misuse mark 16 which says you can take up a serpent and it will harm you right now I believe just like I tell you I was going to tell you about the service today I believe and that this is my revelation this is what God has showed me I believe that in the service of the Lord God protects his own that's why I call this service in the service and we are here in the service of the Lord we're not doing this selfishly we're not doing this close trying to gain something or we're doing this in service for the Lord that's why we are here today when Paul was was going around preaching the gospel and he got to these barbarians and he was there at night with a fire and I asked common struck him in the hand I think a baby I gave this analogy the other day and he that snake struck him on the hand and then these barbarians thought he was a devil and they weren't listening to it but when that snake come and struck him in the hand he looked at it he just shook it off in the fire mark 16 they'll take up serpents and won't harm them in this situation Paul is in the service of the Lord and in doing a service for the Lord Satan tried to come and take him away to take him out and he killed him and that snake come and grab the meat just shook it off on the fire he just kept talking they looked upon him and said oldest devil he's going to die any minute that was a you know that's one of the most venomous snakes there are he's gonna die any moment they were just waiting just watching waiting for him to die he just shook it off the fire he kept going so when Paul didn't die the men that were there looking at him thinking he was a devil now thought he was a God because he shook off this poisonous snake but that was in the service of the Lord now Paul had gone over and said well you know what I'm just gonna tip the Lord I just picked the snake up and you know that's a misapplication of God's Word Satan is miss applying God's Word yes so Jesus uses the word to Cammisa plication it is written thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God we're here today not in the purpose serving the purpose to tempt the Lord we're not here to say I defy hoping not to know we're in a service and in the service for the Lord I believe no everybody a revelation that's up to them I don't look down on anybody thinks different than I do and and I trusted trade they don't look down on me but my revelation is in the service pool of war God's going to take care of God's gonna protect us and can I give you this bit of information if God desired to take me he wants to take me right now if he's done with me I'm gonna be better off anyway I'm not scared to die right but anyway that that's that's beside the point but you understand the mist application of the work here that saint is he's moved his game up to use the word but he's miss applying it and Jesus corrected it now the third time Satan doesn't even try to get him to doubt first time get him to doubt second time he's hydrating the word how to be hydrated now he said exactly what the word said but the hybrid ation here is the Miss applying the primer that's the hybrid ation of the word in this situation again the devil taketh him up into the seating high mountains short of all the demons of the world the glory of them and said unto him all these things will I give the Intel about that will fall down and worship me then say of Jesus unto him get thee get the hint Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve now notice each time as Satan progresses in his revelation in his message in his doubt hybrid new new word Jesus uses the word every single time he doesn't progress he doesn't change he just uses a different part of the word to attack the part that was being brought to him at the time Jesus didn't change it is written it is written it is written and he just read today will defeat the enemy on every ground today just like it did did in the mouths of believers that work will produce exactly what it said amen today as it always has it'll do the same thing today because it's still God's Word so let's not be we're not ignorant but let us not be dull of recognizing when that enemy is coming in and he'll come in like a flood we know the Bible said you come in like a flood friend you accommodate you make a step towards God you do something else for the Lord you make a move and or church or wherever and you make that step though you just expect those those balls he's gonna be lobbing those bombs at you Satan's gonna be lobbing those bombs that you match again he's gonna try to get you to doubt he's gonna kind of try to change it from you and try to hybridize it there from you or something in amen all this counterfeit anti messy stuff is nothing but a lot of us but it's backed by what a man's opinion a man's idea there's a prophet of God backed up and vindicated by God not by man and what he did and what he said and God vindicated and backed it up with words the vindication for all this other there's no vindication it's just their own word it's just their own opinion but God all doesn't change God's not gonna God doesn't have to up his his way of doing things he does have to progress it is the same and it defeats him every time he meant on every level every time praise the Lord Amen god bless you today amen I pray someone said the bless you today in some way Amen god bless you on the streaming better turn the streaming off now for just a few moments now there's a couple things that I wanted to mention to you I know I did a little
