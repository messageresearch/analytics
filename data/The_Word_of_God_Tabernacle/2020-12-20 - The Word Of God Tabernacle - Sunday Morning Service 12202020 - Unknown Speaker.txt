earth [Music] everywhere [Music] christ was [Music] on the mountain over [Music] jesus christ that jesus christ amen and then let's sing that um old classic uh oh come all you faithful it's a popular song this season you know some people sing this song they don't know the true meaning of what you know or any of these type of songs uh you know they just sing it because it's a season but we know the true meaning of why we sing songs i'll start with the verse [Music] him [Music] oh [Music] lord [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] let's start off with the verses [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] sure [Music] me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is hey man uh there weren't any prayer requests that came in the bag that i saw this morning i didn't get any on the phone either i don't know if anyone has a spoken prayer request they want to make known at this time or knows of any needs uh that should be mentioned in prayer this morning oh yeah i i forgot so just now um my roommate um he's been my roommate for about two years or so now but his grandmother has been through a whole battle over the last 10 years or so with she was smoking and she quit and she's been quit for forever but she developed cancer in her lungs and then her lung capacities only to about 50 and now she's to basically um i think she's holding on she probably would have passed by now her one last wish is to have a christmas dinner with her family and they're doing that today oh wow um so i don't i don't know when but it's probably gonna be pretty soon that god takes her and they're all really close so they're all they've been crying for like the last week and spending time with her and she's comatose and then she's back and live and happy and she's come with us for a day um so i just want to keep that family in prayer um the pickets is their name i definitely want to keep that that family in prayer does anyone else have a fair request or a spoken prayer request they want to make them all right let's just stand and of course we want to remember brother bennett while he's out traveling uh he's up in the white mountain so i believe he's going to be making his trip back home today right yeah okay today so he'll be driving back home today so um i know this around this time the traveling starts picking up so we just want to uh pray the lord watch over him as he comes back and has a safe trip back home amen uh brother dennis would you mind and if we all just lift up our hands as brother dennis prays for the needs this morning amen lord jesus we come before you in humbleness of heart knowing father you didn't come to be served but you came to serve others and lord may we follow your example knowing father that you're the greatest one that ever lived on the face of this earth you come with such a desire and such a plan to die on the cross for our sins father without you we are nothing without you will surely fail and lord if there's any good that comes out of our lives it's you that gets the the glory it's you that is worthy of all praise honor and glory in our lives and lord this request of the pickett family this grandmother lord that is dying and desires to have a dinner a christmas dinner with a family lord may you make things where she'll be able to enjoy that time with her family and the burden that's on my heart above all lord does she know you has she accepted you may you place that strongly in her heart to accept you as lord and savior of her life as if she hasn't made things right with you we know lord that's why we're here we're here to live our lives for others as the prophet taught us knowing once we live our lives for other others we look in heaven in the face and help us to always reach out to the laws to always reach out to the ones that are dying and sick and and just needing a touch may we be like them in the book of acts that they took notice that we have been with jesus and lord bless each and every one every request every hand that was raised father may you come on the scene and move on their hearts and give them their hearts desire knowing father that you are desirous to bless us to to see that your family your children are happy and by faith we reach out our portion from the blessed our brother roger as he brings forth the word may you use them to speak to our hearts and may our hearts be open to receive from you our portion that we have need of of the bread of life in your name we pray father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen now you may be seated if you'd like at this time uh does anyone have a song special or uh testimony uh do you wanna yeah yeah yes sir um yeah song and uh testimony uh so i think everyone was here last week except of course roger i had given testimony about having problems with my knees and that they were getting better and monday the next morning there's no pain it's all gone i want to thank god for for touching me and helping helping me because it was weird it's just a sudden onset so usually when that happens i know it's just the devil so i've just been rebuking him and like daddy preached taking action i didn't baby it i kept walking i kept doing things when hiking with the family so i just want to thank him this song is not a christmas song but it i read a scripture i think and it was in joel or it could have been psalms about harvest time and this came on my mind so if you know it i know my family knows it but if you know it feel free to sing along i look and see earth gold enriching selfish [Music] it's [Music] the grain is falling [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's i prayed a prayer lord help me be faithful in all [Music] a precious moment

wait it's growing [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] thank you brother man can you have a quick test on your song specials this morning and i will just sing one more song i was going to try to sing a little song special here but um i guess we'll i'll try it i feel glad to try it out as singing if you know it too uh let's try to see but it's uh let your word be born i believe it's it

[Music] by this moment [Music] reach out and touch the lord as he passes [Music] reach out [Music] god bless you thank you for this opportunity to be able to worship the lord jesus with you i thank brother bennett for inviting me to speak in his absence i appreciate very much that you all being here if you can take your bibles and turn with me to luke chapter 1 verse 26. i'm going to read several verses of scripture luke chapter 1 verse 26. and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary an angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his city and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb shall bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david he shall reign over the house of jacob forever of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen that i know not a man an angel answered or said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called the son of god behold thy cousin elizabeth hath also conceived a son in her old age this is the sixth month with her who was called baron for with god nothing shall be impossible amen yes mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her mary arose in those days and went into hill country with haste into the city of judah entered into the house of zechariah and saluted lisbon they came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary that the babe leaped in her womb elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost she spoke out with a loud voice and said blessed are thou among women blessed is the fruit of thy womb for which it is that this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the baby leaked in my womb for joy blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord mary said my soul the magnify the lord and my spirit have rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest date of his handmaid for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty had done to me great things and his name holy is his name his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered a crowd into the imagination of their hearts it put down the mighty from their seeds and exalted them of the lower degree may the lord have the blessing of the reading of the word you may be seated i'd like to to speak on a christmas message and i know sometimes around the the message is not a popular thing to do because they say that christmas is a pagan holiday i was with brother benny the other day and we was on a job site and somebody asked him he said do you celebrate christmas and he said no we don't he said we celebrate the birth of christ and i thought that was just an outstanding answer because of the importance of the birth of christ he said well it's not the right time why is it at the wrong time because of the truth of what it is satan has done all he can to take away from who it was right that was born there amen he's changed the time of the year he's made a pagan holidays surrounding his birth he's done all these things why has he done that because the truth without a birth there's no death right without a death amen we're lost that's right great there's no salvation without a death okay and so this morning i would like to speak and most of you are familiar with me but i'm always looking at things a bit differently and this has been kind of odd for me because we do a service here on saturday night and not long after i got the saturday night service done scripture started flowing through me for this morning i had a hard time getting ready for the service that's just ahead of this because i had so much material here and that's very unusual for me to know anything besides a starting point right okay it just is but i'd like to go back and just take a few minutes and i'd like to cover the first few verses of this a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary do you realize that the king of kings didn't come to earth as a king right he could have chosen any way he wanted to to come that's right but he chose one of the poorest families that there was they were so poor that they didn't have a blanket the rapid man you say hold on but they was the full the reason he was wrapped in swatted clothes i know the meaning of that but they had to be poor right to not have the needs for a baby we can't imagine that today right even the poor's the poor people knit blankets they give them clothes they do their stuff they hand me down from families but you see become so bored [Music] he come to a poor family am i bring life an angel came to her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this being and the angel realized that his presence troubled her well what we need to realize that we have let become common to us the supernatural of god right now we explained it away this was a very act that was promised in isaiah 7 14 a virgin shall conceive but there was so much time lapsed right they're relatively sure they have forgotten it i'm gonna ask a question because i'm going to get right down where we live this morning and if i offend you i apologize if i offend you but the word offends you i don't apologize right amen okay but have we been so long since that we was in the meetings of brother brown since the tapes and the supernatural prayer lines have we forgotten that haven't just become quote that brother brown said instead of the life right amen that was manifested there right right it's become a doctrine it's become legalism yes it's become do's and don'ts right with the life of christ is forgiveness and love and power amen we've come become judgmental because people don't believe the message so we think that they're less than we are right right that's garbage yes religious spirit yes sir amen that would let come in i told you it's going to get down where we live today people won't know if somebody's in the message that's nonsense amen are they in christ amen that's the devil separating you from somebody else that making help right that's true that's a religious spirit that's not the holy ghost i want to show you something that's where we're going to go today the angel said you will be overshadowed by the holy ghost it is words right he said by the holy ghost you'll be overshadowed and what did that produce in mary life yeah i read it to you what did he produce because elizabeth said right just her very greeting yeah this was was filled with the holy ghost just her very greeting yes and a baby leaked in a womb just at the very greening of mary because the holy ghost had overshadowed her right paul says in galatians see if i can find it real quick my children of whom i travail at birth again until christ be formed in you amen the spirit that god is to perform in us not our knowledge right right not our knowledge amen it's the spirit of god that's to come out of us amen we're to love one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you can't love your neighbor without the love of god that's right yes because you got eyes that's looking at you and looking at somebody else and we're seeing what we don't like right we're seeing their lifestyles that we don't like we don't like their mannerism we don't like who they are so what do we do we open our mouth and we execute law on them right wow when we do that we're shutting down our own life we're shutting ourselves down amen we won't criticize somebody else we don't like them we don't like how they do you know what that proves you don't have the holy ghost amen i told you you're going to be strong today you can't speak negative and have the spirit of god remember right right right you can't do it now this is being filmed live going around the world also we have about 500 people that watch these services because the pattern that was given to mary can't be broken brother branham said we must receive the word the same as mary did she didn't receive it intellectually she asked a question and he answered her he said how can this be i know it's not a man right but we've let the religious spirits come in we would let the message spirits i remember the last service i was with my uncle he had gone to macon georgia in 1955 the last service i was with him five years ago he's gone to be with the lord now but he took 20 minutes before he played a tape and he talked about what he saw in macon not about what he said we're more interested in what brother brown said than what we saw hmm he said wait my brother listen he talked about jesus christ being manifested in those services healing the sick the lame to walk setting the cactus free that's what he saw he wasn't talking about brother brown got that one the brother was against that one listen when people come against us it's more of a test for us than it is them right yes but we get an attitude it's time that we get back to the altar for a refilling he said brother this is not a christmas message it is a christmas mission they could be birthed it's greater in our hearts right folks there's trouble on every side yes amen right and i'm going to say something here that i haven't i've only talked privately to people that have only voiced it a few times and i may be incorrect here but i believe the pandemic is on many levels going to usher in the closing out of the world but this is just the beginning yes yes it is but you know what all this testing's about it's not about what you got the virus or not it's about you willingly giving up your dna okay they couldn't get it unless you willingly give it up okay so now they got a track of you okay and i'm relatively sure for us to travel overseas they're going to make us get right yeah there's going to be no choice about it there's a lawsuit of doctors in europe because this vaccination is going to make women infertile around the world you talking about control the enemy is coming in like a flood right but see if the enemy keeps us fighting each other keeps us criticizing each other i don't like this i don't like that folks i i i i'm going to run out of time here but that's the spirit of the enemy right yes amen amen well i'm critical to you brother dennis that's the enemy spirit that's not the holy ghost you said well but i'm just speaking fact that's nonsense because i show you something and i've done this before and i i don't mean to pick on you brother dennis but can i use you just a minute okay i trust you don't take it personally but i can come up to you and i say man you got them sticking cowboy boots on what you trying to be like somebody big you know i could criticize you right for what you dress for the way you speak and where does that go right in here okay we take that but i can say well dennis i love you and appreciate you he said but you don't know me i said but i do know you because we're one in christ make a move okay but you'll have a hard time receiving that we'll receive the negative that quick right well we won't receive the positive about each other right we say brother i appreciate it hey i appreciate you too what we just done we have just reflected when somebody was trying to encourage us we didn't receive it right if we don't receive the spirit of god amen in the depths of our heart like mary did brother brother said we must receive the word not the printed word the spirit words amen just like mary did that christ be formed in us if we want to know what spirit we are watch what comes out of our mouth amen yes okay example when jesus walked down to the pool of bethesda and he told the man pick up the bed and walk and then what he went to carrying his bed the pharisees said it's not lawful for you to carry your bed it wasn't marveling at a man that had been on the bed for 38 years was up walking carrying his bed they was almost right they was only concerned about what they saw that didn't add up to what they wanted right right right amen they wasn't looking at the miracle they couldn't receive that hmm but roger the message is important yes but we don't enter receive it intellectually we receive it in our spirit amen that's right he said well why don't we listen to tapes why don't we read the scriptures it's because we feed a spirit right right you are what you eat yes true that's right it's true that's in the natural yes i'm 98 pounds less than i was because i eat less you are what you eat but when i was 300 pounds my blood sugar was up here we're talking about a complete healing right amen i've checked my blood sugar and that's just happened in the last two months i controlled it with diet exercise my blood sugar's so low now that i talked about in the 80s with nothing right if you believe god amen you have to receive it okay i shared a testimony last night on the service i have struggled for weeks with my ears my sinuses makes it feel like my water ears are full of water and then it runs out and makes them itch it gotten to the point i was getting up at night the night before last after i got up something said to me why don't you ask me to fix your ears right and i told him lord i'm sorry all right i just never thought about it see we are so critical the way somebody worships right they would have never believed the religious people that day would have never believed the king of kings laid in a manger wouldn't have believed it the king of kings will come at least to the daughter of problem of man but die right he said i come to save that that was lost it was undone right he said i come to do that he said love covers a multitude of sins oh yes let me if i don't watch it i'll run completely out of time i need to go back here i know that most of you people here have heard me read this scripture before ephesians 6 and 17 take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is right yes the word of god amen okay so what was that that come to mary here the word of god that had been spoken by isaiah okay right what was come to us in our day it was what was spoken by malachi amen behold i send you elijah the prophet right well the people of this day raise elijah the prophet higher than god raised him right go back there with that scripture with me just a moment turn with me and if i take too long today you'll just deal with it okay verse 5 behold i send you elijah the prophet behold i send you he tells you who he's sending right him too before he tells you who he sinned so what does that make it more important elijah the prophet or who he's being sent to right hello see what we've got here that's the fulfillment of the word spoken by the prophet malachi and we beheld it in our day but we've done the same thing with it that they did if you're not a jew if you're not a pharisee that they're dealing with christ we've done the same thing with our day it's not by the letter of this message because it wasn't by brother branham's learning right that he was able to do that that's right amen it was by the spirit of god that he received amen amen okay see today we like to put but about them higher than us that means we don't have to be responsible to what the spirit spoke to right okay because we can't reach that if we place him higher but if we really want to know the truth he said that we must receive the word the same way that mary did now i'm going to get hard on you again mary was a little bitty nobody woman right hey she wasn't even a man that he come to but in the jewish law her word wasn't even allowed in court right but yet god found it expedient to come down to realize i've got so many scriptures this morning i can't begin to get done this i say then as apostle paul speaking in galatians 5 16 walk in the spirit and not in the fulfillment of the lust of the flesh lust has nothing to do that word lust there has nothing to do with sex it has to do with pride it has to do with things like that because out of the mouth do we speak what's in the heart okay out of mary's mouth her salutation after she received the holy ghost we should be centered in christ to the point and out of our mouths blessings enviance murders drunkenness revel in such like what you i tell you before as i vote so told you in times past the day which do shall not inherit the kingdom of god right amen what's the kingdom of god i want to go someplace here what is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is the authority of god right or wrong now stop and think about that what is exercise from the kingdom the queen or the king their authority and they're not questioned right right or wrong thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven that's right that's right in earth this earth this 16 elements of dirt that the authority of the word would come to me like he didn't marry repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ amen listen most of what we don't like about someone else let me go back here i need to go here it says they shall not inherit the kingdom of god it does not say that shall be lost right you say that but roger because the kingdom of god and salvation is not the same thing right now i've got you really upset because all the people that you cut out because you didn't like their actions are still in right you didn't put them that's right you can't cut my dear wife i said you know i said people don't like me a lot of times i said but they can't throw me out because it didn't put me in right true that's right amen that's right okay i've got a saying you can get angry with me you can dislike me but unless you're a snake you got to get glad in the same skin you got mad at right yeah it's true true amen you know so what was that in the garden of eden a serpent a snake so unless you're a snake you got your glad in the same skin you got mad here right if you're born again you're not a snake amen satan may be hammering at your heart you know i got a request not long ago a person wanted to pray for their spouse i think we need to start judging people let me go here i've just got a few more minutes quit judging people for what we see because you realize that the law said that mary was to be stoned right anyone that was pregnant without being married was to be stoned to death she accepted the black mark right yeah exactly she accepted that everyone i walked around said oh she was pregnant because they could see the signs right before they got married she was pregnant what were they doing i was executing judgment on somebody that they had no idea what they were talking about and i'm afraid that we do that way too much yes you can't give life not to destroy it that's right right and if we're sons and daughters of god we are givers of light givers of life not destroyers of life what comes out of our mouth better not be negative amen amen well people come to me they tell me a certain minister's done certain things this this this and i said listen i said what do you think about it i think i think it is not my responsibility i'll tell you how strongly i believe this i want to talk about a circumstance that some of you may know about some of them may not because it's been many years ago but there was a minister in the west they were stepping out on his wife and some people in his church suspected it so they heard a private detective to catch you you know what they caught it they destroyed the man you know why because they went contrary to the word the word says your sins will find you out right it didn't say any part in me or anyone else you're a sin fighter okay when we take on that role we're executing judgment without god's authority he said but oh he's wrong god's to deal with it not me god's to deal with it that's right not me you say oh no about roger oh yeah yes amen right okay now and i can call the name on this brother graham snelling that was the second pastor of the branham tabernacle there was one before him and then graham snelling was put in brother graham snelling got caught in adultery brother brown come off the field went and talked to graham he went to the church he said don't put him out graham has repented amen okay we won't take that right we'll be judgmental on that we don't like it six months later graham got off in false doctrine brother graham come off the field again and he took him out of the pulpit he didn't ask him anything we'll judge somebody for something that could be put on the blood but something that will damn our soul we'll sit under day in and day out right right okay because the spirit of god it's a religious spirit a false doctrine is a religious spirit right and a religious spirit will stam your soul right right it will if we are going to look at the true spirit of christmas it's the holy ghost amen amen it's nothing else but the holy ghost amen i i go to share a personal thing here 1987. my youngest brother took his own life my dad ended up being the longest servant deacon at the brethren tabernacle in the history of the church he had been on the board probably 20 years in 1987 maybe not quite 20 years i think he went on in 1970 or 71. because of the the things that was happening in a lot of the family members around said dad should step down dad should do this that should be that i said because this house wasn't in order is this that him and mom was at odds with my youngest brother and just taking his own life dad told me later said i wasn't praying about it is that one talked of his brother which was brother collinson he says god i don't think i'd resign what was it it was a thing that pulled him through but we want to take god away from people because of what we see happening right well that's just for caesar but the spirit of god is eternal life forever amen see they just tried to get us to the the enemy trying to get us to lose faith in god right just the mayor of speaking brought life yes saint john 14 12 a very familiar scripture verily i say unto you not to you all unto you he that believeth on me singular he the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go within my father i got a question for you how many people did the angel gabriel appear to how many people did the angel gabriel appear to just one correct mary singular one person amen we try to the enemy tries to make the gospel the group of the word of god tabernacle or the group of tucson tabernacle or the group of the branham tabernacle but it's not amen it's individuals that god speaks to their heart amen amen is god doing the speaking right brother graham said the greater works in one several places she said you can't do greater than what christ did but there's one quote maybe two but i know for sure why he said greater works is imparting eternal life how do we impart eternal life how do we impart eternal life anybody got any idea i've done told you you have to have it you have to have it to impart what did mary do when she went to elizabeth's house she imparted eternal life is that simple it was not complicated for the dentist yes it's not complicated zach it's just merely speaking about what you have amen amen not what you want to have what you have am i that's right too many of us are talking about what we hope to have hmm but not about what we have it's a woman i'm gonna ask you a question and i told you i read through the scriptures shall not inherit the kingdom of god i said this is proof that you don't have the holy ghost because you can't get in the kingdom of god without the holy ghost right okay when the scripture says mark 11 23 when you stand praying forgive amen okay do you know if you don't forgive all the times you've asked for forgiveness is not forgiven right now yes amen you don't receive grace until you give it out right evidence that you've got grace is when you give grace to somebody else amen right amen amen but somebody's spitting in your face you say lord bless you and you walk away yes wow you're not folding up five real firmly and minister them real strongly okay when we're able to give out grace when we're able to give forgiveness when we're able to behave in the very worst of circumstances when people are against us but people don't understand us they talk about about us brother doug mccues told me one time that he was at that meeting that brother branham was at when the angels of the lord come to him and told him that there was a trap set for him okay and i think that if it was a trap set for him there's a lot of traps set for us exactly yes exactly okay yes and i think we don't realize how much the traps are set for us yes he said that the young people were sitting on the front row and it was about a four foot stage up there like an auditorium you know where i'm talking about about four foot high stays all the way across and they were sitting on the front row and he said they were literally making love and they didn't and the voice spoke to me him and said whatever you say is the way it'll be okay got to be careful what you say here now right he said i could spoke and they would have carried them out he says but neither do i condemn thee i forgive thee why grace come out his mouth right because he had received grace right correct amen hallelujah we can't give eternal life if we haven't received it right i'm gonna make a statement here in closing there's way too many people that claim to be message believers that have got an intellectual holy ghost not a real holy ghost right say what's the difference it's because that you have studied not that you've received right okay you say oh i can't do that jesus said you could yeah when he told peter he said you've not been taught this by man right but been showed this by my father in heaven amen hello that's right and it was talking about who he was so there's such a thing as an intellectual holy ghost yes yes and that's where the religious spirits dwell they think they're right and they have no grace for nobody let's look at jesus's life in closing when they brought the woman caught to him in adultery he said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more right when they was absolutely accusing her we caught her in the very act but you know they were contrary to the word because they were supposed to bring the man and the woman they only brought the woman according to the law if you're going to live by the law if you're going to judge somebody by the law you know you gotta be judged so folks all right i trust that today i don't know how good a job i've done because i had so much today but i want us to be able to lay aside because the spirits around the message will condemn you for even separate celebrating christmas i was raised at the branham tabernacle they always get a suit of clothes to brother branham and brother neville as a christmas gift he always got a new suit and the kids they give a box of candy and an orange to every kid in attendance to the sunday before christmas years later all the widows and divorced women to give a food basket people say you shouldn't do that brother brown gives gifts to his children but he did he said well no here's where i'm gonna go with this are you more spiritual than brother breton was okay intellectually you may be but in real holy ghost leadership no no amen right you know you can cut people in and out because they want to recognize christmas or residential birth of christ listen you have no authority over them all you do is exercise this judgment on yourself [Music] amen that's all i used to get floods of people criticizing me for my stand on christmas but after i saw that quote without a christmas there's no easter without easter we're lost hallelujah amen why do you think that the devil drug it from april to december trying to make havoc of a truth right the bottom line is the day you're born is not as important as your birth is hello the day you're born is only a date but your birth is life amen right that's right so why don't we make a big deal and try to cut out all the worship of a risen savior amen let's come set us free amen if we love him we love one another yes we see imperfections in everyone's life me being in the ministry you know what that does that puts it on a big screen yes right okay and the devil's pointing them out hey look there look at that you know what's he trying to do murder my influence right okay right yes it says some of you were murderers you know if you're criticizing somebody else murdering their influence from christ that's right okay shall not inherit the kingdom of god shall not inherit the authority of the power of god right you can't speak cursing and life right they can't come out of the same mouth they can't do it just the salutation of mary that's all it was i know the scripture don't say this but there's quotes on brother branham said john the baptist was dead in the mother's womb and justice speaking filled merry with the holy ghost and the baby leaked in her womb amen hello we right it it's like merry christmas it's not intellectual it's not what i got to do that's right that's not what i gotta do you know why do you think they criticized this message why do you think it's turned into legalism why do you think there's so many naysayers because there's a truth there right well if we do battle with the day sayers we're in the same ditch they are amen okay because there's no love in that there's no none i go back look what brother newton said he said we don't celebrate christmas we just celebrate the birth of christ i like that so much that's so well put okay what his birth was the wise men brought gifts okay what was the wise man doing bringing gifts to honor his death um that's right hallelujah okay why do we give each other gifts he said but i don't give somebody gifts because i don't celebrate christmas well that's your problem i like to express my love for somebody i care for yeah right exactly okay scripture says how can i love a god that i have not seen when i don't love my little man that i have seen that's right how many you say i want to be able to walk away from anything want to be able to speak with the spirit annoyance i don't want a religious spirit no regarding my speech right i want to speak as given by the holy ghost have you raised your hands glorious gracious heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity to come here today yes you saw the hands that go up lord they around the world by trust just speak the eternal health each
