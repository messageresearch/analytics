TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello everyone god bless you today uh sorry for the confusion and the lateness again got a new computer yesterday and i thought i had everything set up but uh digging quite a couple of little details i didn't quite have in there and i had to do it two or three times and it finally then went through so uh my sim my apologies for that and uh putting urls in any just computer stuff is unless you know what you're doing it's kind of difficult to go with it but hopefully everybody's there hopefully everybody's okay hopefully everybody's got it streamed and lived and ready to go so again i sincerely apologize um we'll see what happens next week but um we'll probably stream again next week but uh you all know the building and things i was gonna announce this at the end but uh and i will give you some more detail at the end but i'll tell you hopefully next sunday will be the last streaming and then uh we can have live in person service there in our new building uh hopefully the target date is august 2nd so maybe we get past this point and i'm kind of taking just a couple of minutes here so that we get past this initial thing and hopefully everybody gets signed on so um if you don't maybe you can get the prayer requests and all of what we give maybe when it gets archived so but uh just trust us to be a blessing to you today i want to read a couple of prayer requests that we have that's been that's coming to us today um also first of all as i said to you yesterday i have not been able to verify yet to make sure that this is a valid request but we're going to we're going to pretend it's a valid request we're going to assume it's a valid request until i hear something otherwise that i got a email or a text from tabitha yesterday about brother donnie's daughter erica uh who has been diagnosed with liver cancer uh in the text said something about a couple of sets of twins which probably some of you may already know uh but cancer is usually not a very good thing um usually when it gets to the liver it's already been other places but we know a mighty god that is more than able to heal that is more unable to deliver and it can bring her through perfectly healed and well so we're just going to remember that request in prayer also continue to remember from last week sister kelly batman um well i i hadn't i've texted this week but i haven't heard back uh talked brother dave who does talk to her some and he hasn't heard back from her if anybody knows you can let me know but uh please remember sister kelly batman and heard from brother dave that she had a stroke weaker week or more ago so just trust that the lord's hand is upon her to touch and help and bless her and her family uh also we want to continue to remember um uh brother dennis sister leah in prayer uh for her situation of course the doctors and the requests we had last week for peach also want to remember brother uh sister sheila's brother harlan in prayer she hasn't heard from him lately but just trust in the lord's hands going to be upon his life and the lord's going to touch him and help bring him through this situation but just continue to remember him in prayer as well if if you would please also i had an unspoken request for sister shrine uh she has a new job opportunity upcoming so just want to remember that in prayer if you would as well also want to remember in prayer uh brother pat had sent me a request for to remember austin continue to remember austin and his girlfriend yuli that came to our service here a few weeks back so good to see them and have them in service but remember them in prayer that the lord helps continue to provide their jobs for them and that they don't shut things down again there uh in louisiana so that they can have their jobs and continue to work so you want we definitely want to continue to remember that in prayer um so thankful to the lord that god's blessed us there and remember those requests to prayer um i know there was a prayer request or two i think i missed last week i hope i didn't miss any of this week but uh god knows our requests if anything's on your heart or anything you know of please just remember that in prayer we want to continue to remember uh sister priscilla and her family are mother and family sister in prayer brothers the lord would just continue to comfort them the loss of their um their sister martha we had the funeral service celebration memorial thursday and i thought it went really well uh the pastor there i thought did a good job and uh kept things going and some really wonderful things were said about her and of course it's very encouraging to know that uh someone has made the commitment to the confession to the lord jesus and had mentioned the priscilla the desire to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and things like that so and got to meet a few good people there and friends so just appreciate that time but remember them in prayer martha still has gone to be with her reward with the lord and her reward so just remember her in prayer as well as you if you would so and again if there's any other requests please continue remember help us we got we got pray for us we have some work to do on the building before we get it ready and me and brother roger's been very very busy um the past few weeks month or so so we're just you know we talk about the work to do and all and i told him i said brother it's not necessarily the work i think it's work that we can do uh i think it's the time getting the time to do it is probably the biggest thing right now so certainly remember that in prayer if you would and i just thankful the lord provided that for us i'll give you some more details about it and all i sent you a picture hopefully you got the picture and description or the address of where it's at it's a nice place and i believe the lord has provided us i looked at it yesterday on my maps and uh it is exactly 18 minutes from here to the old church and it's exactly 18 minutes from here to the new church for us some of you probably have to drive a little further most of you i think it's going to be a little closer uh but uh i believe that you would come with the words priest irregardless so god bless you and let's just go to the lord in prayer now if we could father god we thank you so much for your blessings and your love to us thank you for helping us lord

blessings upon in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you today i'm going to be reaching a little bit because uh i'm using a laptop that the camera is right here so uh and my phone and recording and things like that so i trust it won't bother you too bad but let's go into the scripture we're going to go and uh maybe lord willing maybe not take quite as long this week but uh maybe get about 45 minutes or so and just see how the lord leads this and where he decides to take this today um in revelation chapter 10 we're going to go continue on with the the mysteries of god in christ this will be part six and this is god revealing himself to his people part two so we're going to continue on kind of try to before we left off last week and begin back again with revelation 10 7 as we begin every one of these services like this so revelation 10 7 says but in the day's voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery singular of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets amen i remember of course so many times that we look at this as the mysteries that are to be finished the mysteries that are to be done all those mysteries wound up in jesus christ that god was able to bring in the condescension of jesus to bring him to us a people so where we could see him and feel him and hear him and record his voice and record it as in written down and be able to be privy to that and through the revelation that god gives us in his word for today but uh i want to go through this and there's a few points that i believe the lord wants to make in here uh with this and beginning back in genesis uh i want to go back to genesis chapter one and read that again as we did the other day uh and uh lord help me again this is not my fortess to preach to a camera and of course i'm watching myself and it's 10 seconds behind so uh just trusting the lord's anointing today genesis chapter one verse one look at this now again in the beginning was the in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light now there's several things in here i want to bring out a point a part of now we understand there's uh there's the parts of this that scripture that is spiritual that it's of the spiritual element and the spiritual realm there's those are this that are of the natural uh that go come forth as the natural now uh if you go back to this you look it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now that's a statement that's selfish sustaining that statement in in and of itself means exactly what it says that in the beginning god created the heaven and earth that's it that's that that's the end of that now how he did it when he did it how long it took him it doesn't say that notice now when he began now look though and the earth was without form and void so it had been created and the heavens and the earth all this this had been created we don't know how long again or uh or or that but look so the earth was without form and void in darkness upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god then moved upon the face of the waters the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters if you go back to david uh in the psalms i believe it's psalm 104 you'll see that david even talked about that how god moved upon the earth to reform the earth well that's what he did he created it and then as he began to speak he began to form that earth into the way that he wanted it to be now i'm saying this because we we're obviously trying to in our our limited abilities bring down the almighty omnipotent all-knowing eternal infinite god down into a place to where god can reveal himself to us uh and and knowing that god did this and knowing that created that god created all these things then god's spirit came notice now god's spirit came and it moved upon the face of the waters god's spirit came now remember god created man in his own image when god created man he eventually now it took him a process but eventually man became a trial being man became body spirit soul that's what that's what man became the body the spirit on the inside of the soul that's on the inside of that triune being so if god made us in his own image then that must mean that god himself of course is tron being that we try to again wrap our little p brains around i mean there's so much more to this than we can imagine or say or think but just to try to bring it down into a way that we could maybe grasp it a little bit including myself if you will but now the spirit of god is moving out upon the face of the waters and as that spirit of god moved out god's spirit came out moved out upon the face of the waters and god said and god said that was god's word god said let there be light now that began the six day creation that we know of or the six day reforming world as you want to say of what god had created god had already created the heaven and the earth and then the spirit moved out upon that creation and then god began to speak and as god began to speak now you notice of course in god as always has always been uh that the the triune being a father son spirit uh all those have been there of course that's all a part of god jesus is the almighty god we read last week all these supporting him now if that spirit moved upon the face of the water and god spoke amen now god spoke when the spirit of god and notice that spirit of god the spirit of god is as said in the hebrews is the mind or the breath of god that that moved upon the face of the water so now if we in in our human abilities have to think before we speak and we although some of us probably don't think before we speak as my dad always told me that but but literally we think before we speak it has to be a thought before it becomes a word well when the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water that spirit is the mind of god or the breath that breath now who's in the mind of god amen so go there with me so as that spirit of god mind breath moved upon the face of the water god spoke so that if you will it now the word logos doesn't appear until the greek so the the old testament translated from hebrew so uh but if you if you take the same definitions if you will you can see that the the logos uh moving upon the face of water the mind the breath of god becoming rhema or the spoken word as as that mind of god became spoken word it it spoke and as it spoke it created we know hebrews tells us that uh that the these worlds were framed by what the rhema the word of god as god spoke the spirit became tangible that was in the spirit realm came down by the faith and spoken word of god into a reality into something tangible something you could touch see feel smell something that became a tangible for us humans well first it began there in the elohim as elohim as he spoke in his mind the spirit of god moved and he began to speak and when he spoke it created oh friend if we could just get to the point to understand the power of the spoken word and understand that we as children of god in the commission of god gives us his spirit to speak what does that do it it can create another world and go live on it amen just the power of that spoken word the power of the spoken word today god in us is the same now as it was then when it created that word spoke god said now when god said go look going back in the hebrew now uh from logos rhema which are greek words from the new testament but if you go look and you see that that that spoke when he spoke that's a verb if you go look in the hebrew it'll show you that word speak in the hebrew is a verb it's a it's a word of action so it wasn't something that we see at the spiritual it's something that's tangible he spoke when he spoke he created something came forth he said let there light and let there be light and there was light amen light came upon the heaven and earth that god had created amen that's that's seems very simplistic but it's true by faith these worlds were framed were framed by the word of god when god spoke let there be now that part of god of course that brought in the condensation this is just sort of laying the outline or even the beginning part of it if we could say beginning because the bible says in the beginning god spirit god creating bringing forth life as he did in the womb of a woman named mary through the holy spirit because it was always in him to do always a part of god oh think of this always a part of god in him to do to be able to even before the fall in the garden of eden this was in god this is a part of god for him to come out for him to bring forth that that sought that attribute in the mind to speak the spirit of god moving in the womb of a of a woman to create a blood cell that became jesus christ as we know the son of god the only begotten son of god created in the womb see god condensating himself bringing himself from one position from one state and bringing himself into a way that he could reveal himself to his people that he could reveal himself to us oh friend i guarantee you adam loved that time of fellowship with god in the cool of the day but i can't imagine he would love that any more than he loves the time to be able to fellowship with us that he loves to be able to come down and talk to you and to be able to fellowship with you and be able to bring back and everything that happened to bring back the uniting of god and man again that god and man could have that same fellowship was god revealing himself to his people only way to do it be able to condensate down into a kinfolk a kinsmen redeemer someone who was kin to us that we could be able to see him again tangible feel him hear him we can still read his words in this beautiful holy bible still today the life-giving words that we can read that means so much to us amen in the beginning god now i'm going to not today come back into the garden of eden but i want to hit a couple of other high points this was going to be the service today a couple of other high points that accentuate or highlight back to what we just talked about and read now you may be going with me already in your mind but physically go with me in the bible to saint john chapter one saint john chapter one i know what you're all thinking because you're all getting it in your mind right now in the beginning god uh in the beginning was the word see there we go back see in the beginning so we look now genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created saint john 1 in the beginning was the word amen in the beginning god in the beginning was the word now that word greek is logos of course spirit word logos is a thought or concept thought or concept now you see why i draw that back to where the spirit of god was in the beginning when the spirit of god moved remember thought his mind or breath see the spirit of god uh and the logos now in the beginning was the word the logos which is the father concept uh listen now though the expression or utterance of that thought the expression or utterance of that thought now that takes us right back to genesis 1 1-3 the mind of god the expression of god the thoughts of god brought into expression or utterance as we know as word word tangible rhema that comes forth out of god out of you out of jesus that word but in the beginning now it's saying the was the word the rhema the the logos of god that logos came forth that logos brewed over that logos that came and and and showed himself in the form of adam that logos that came and was the representative of jesus slaying the lambs that logos that came forth and was there in the form of melchizedek that logos that came and was the pillar of fire in the day in the cloud of night the children of israel that logos that came and was and fellowshipped and was in a body form with abraham when he was going to go down and and check on sodom and gomorrah it's the same logos that came and became jesus christ god condescending himself how many types shadows in the old testament through the bible do we have probably the most prominent one the paschal lamb isaiah 12 our of exodus 12 the paschal lamb and the passover lamb so many times types how about how about isaac how about isaac and the type of isaac packing the wood up the mountain to be a sacrifice as acceptable by god i'm going to get up there isaac said my father hears the wood and all the words that where's the sacrifice where's the lamb for sacrifice abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb god will provide himself a sacrifice but look at isaac the man the boy tote his own cross tote his own wood up the hill amen the wood and the fire but where is the sacrifice god will provide himself but see now in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god of course all a part of him all a part of him from the beginning that condensation doesn't just come down and end with jesus christ that condensation then comes in the form of that holy spirit to live in you to live in us so that we now are the manifestation of that thought that god had before the foundation of the world that brewed over and and became jesus christ the holy spirit in you in you and i in his people in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the same was in the beginning with god amen all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so everything of course is just simply saying that everything was made by him it was made by him it was made for him and there was nothing that is made today that you can see that wasn't made by him in him was life now that life that word life is zoe or the literal life of god the literal almighty life of god is zoe it was in him was life and the life was the light of men what is that light now notice that light still yet in logos form had not come into tangible form yet had not come into reality yet but it was still there in him was that light who was that light that light is jesus christ he was that light that was in him when he came to the earth what did he say i am the light i am the light of the world he said that i am that light he uh when he said that but now in him was life the life was the light of men jesus the light of men the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended that not that's why the unbeliever doesn't like it doesn't believe it doesn't want to have anything to do with it uh they don't want to listen they don't want to go to church they don't want to obey they don't because the darkness doesn't understand it the darkness will never see the light the darkness will never comprehend or understand the darkness will never have a revelation of the light to them that's just what happens the bible says that if this law if it is uh um if it is heated it's yet to those that are lost that the the god of this world has blinded their eyes because if you go over in in john 3 it says that the men would rather they love darkness rather than light well the bible does say if you love the world of the things of the world how loveth the how well is the love of god in you well what is it they've chosen darkness over light they've chosen the world over jesus they've chosen the things of the world and the things of the uh of this evil place of darkness over the over jesus christ and when jesus came to his own people they rejected him but the people today they see the darkness they they can't pop comprehend it can't comprehend it here um they can't comprehend it they can't comprehend the light see the darkness comprehended not there was a man sent from john whose name god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men might believe him there was a man sent from john amen notice this a man sent from john god whose name was john or dares i say there was a man sent from god whose name was william branham the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light he came to bear witness of the light amen he was not that light but he come to bear witness of that light who is that light that light is jesus amen that light is jesus see that all men through him might believe the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe it was not the light but was sent to bear witness of that light he was the witness of jesus christ that was the true light see each other in succession like that like john the baptist did were here for that purpose that was the purpose that they were here for their purpose was to bring that light into life to to help people see through revelation that light and who that light is amen so to be able to see that uh was was the light of men that was the true light who is that jesus jesus was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world now i want you to see how this is condescending how here i want you to see how this has come from one spot to the next where this is uh uh coming down from the beginning in the beginning being the word downing into this place now to where the light is beginning to shine and that john the baptist was here to bear witness of that light to help everyone understand and see how this was a witness of that light john the baptist was here that's why he was able to say that you know behold the lamb of god which take away the sin of the world because there he was the lamb of god now let's look here the true light which every uh which light of every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him but the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god who is that now that's that's brought from in the beginning was the word the light the life that was in god that was coming forth that was shining in the darkness down into john the baptist which began to under uh reveal or begin to preach jesus christ that word and as that word came forth then it began to come in in the human flesh and and then showed us as we then receive the power to become sons of god now it's gone from that part to in each one of us from that in the beginning to now with us that gave us the power to become the sons of god now what does that make us does that not put this bride in that position of being a part of god almighty of being that thought that attribute does that not show the revelation of jesus christ to his people so that we can see him and and he could be revealed to us the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and now he is the same yesterday today and forever the word may flesh that look us that would be flesh that word that attribute that creation that came down into the womb of mary that created a blood cell that became the lord jesus christ became flesh that word coming into flesh wine so that we could see it so that we could know it that it would be revealed to us somehow that's why jesus looked at his disciples and he said who do men say that i son of man and some say well some say you're this and some say you're that and some say these others and and then but then jesus looked and got very personal with him and said but who do you say that i am and peter of course became the spokesman of the group stood up and said that thou art the christ the son of the lady god and jesus looked at it and said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and upon this rock what is that rock that rock is the revelation of who jesus christ is that rock is that revelation that rock is jesus and the and dares i say the understanding but the revelation of the truth of who he is not some trinity not some father son holy ghost not some errant baptisms or uh titles but the lord jesus christ and who he is and who he is to us his bride how was he able to do it he came down so that we could come and so that he could come that we could be uh that we could be partakers of that so that we could see that the word became flesh and dwelt among us and he's standing there amongst his believers dares i say to us today who do you say that he is because that's what really matters not what they said but who do you say that he is that's what matters to me who he is to me who is he to me who is he to you because that's what really matters for that revelation it's who he is seminary or some other church or denomination but who is it to you not to your parents not to your spouse not your children nephews uncles nieces whatever you personally who is he to you that has to become a revelation god has made it possible so that that that spirit in us recognizes that that that spirit of god because they're the same spirit the two become one is to literally hybrid or attempt to in in people's minds hybrid the mind of god to hybrid the word because you see and understand now who that is where that came from what it represents to hybrid that is to hybrid the mind of god you can't hybrid god's word his word is pure his word is right look revelation chapter 3 revelation 14 and the angel church laodiceans write these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god let me read you a quote there from the church age book just a moment you can see it in the smyrna church age god came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost and in the virgin womb of a tabernacle for the purpose of death the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god who that is who jesus is that beginning of the creation of god remember where we just came from in the beginning of this we came from i know i've said a lot in probably a short period of time but we notice where it came from where it began where was it the elohim the great almighty in the beginning created the heads and the earth the spirit moved upon the face of the waters and god spoke and said let there be the word became flesh and dwelt among us the logos became rhema and it became physical it became tangible see but jesus that true and faithful witness is the beginning of the creation of god that creation that brought us salvation and i want to read this one scripture uh before it was one more scripture before i close here because my time does certainly seem to get away awful quickly on me but let's go to the first uh chapter one colossians chapter one and begin with verse 12 of uh colossians 1 12 look at this now giving thanks unto the father which has made us meek to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints and light who had delivered us oh there's so much in here i want to talk about who had you may need to visit this later who had delivered us from the power of darkness look at this let's go back to the 12th first version giving thanks unto the father which had made us meet that means able to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints where in light who is the light jesus so he has made us meet or able to be partakers of the inheritance god has made us able to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in christ in light now it transitions from giving thanks unto the father who's made us able unto the light which is the who in the 13th verse who had delivered us from the power of darkness amen he delivered us the power of darkness and has translated or moved us not translated as in transformed but translated us as in moving from one spot to the next or putting us from one position to another has who has delivered us from the power of darkness and hath moved us or translated us or changed us into the kingdom of his dear son jesus amen he's moved us he's translated us from the grip of the power of darkness that held us from the beginning of the garden of eden to this time today has moved us now after he's delivered us from the group of darkness moved us now over into the kingdom of jesus christ praise the lord in whom now jesus in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who's that jesus we have now the forgiveness of sin through redemption through the blood of jesus christ who is the image now again he's talking about jesus of course this is this is the theme of our services here this is the theme of our crisis the mysteries plural in christ see uh that is our life that is our message that is our hope that is our speech that is our our faith that is our everything jesus christ who is the image or the expression of the invisible god jesus christ the created blood cell we just read the beginning of the creation of god was that expression of the invisible god the spirit god became tangible the spirit god came into flesh and was that expression now not just humanity as human beings but in every way in every facet was god in the expressed image of jesus the express image of god in every way you can go over to the second verse of the second chapter read verse nine for in him jesus dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead ugly all the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in christ so when he says here that that jesus is that expressed image of the invisible god that means in every form and fashion in every way not just as you looked at him as as a flesh being but in every way he was almighty god that's why isaiah called him the almighty god because that's who he is the almighty god the firstborn of every creature for by him jesus were all things created that are in heaven and they're in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things we read that genesis 1 we read that saint john 1 he is the beginning of all things and by him all things stand or consist they stand today because of who he is god said let there be there was the spirit of god moved and god said let there be and there was and it stands today everything that it was in him he created was by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist that includes us all things stand today and he is the head of the body the church jesus christ who is the beginning amen revelation 3 4 14 we just read who is the beginning he is the beginning of the creation of god the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and all things down that brings us although i probably take one more subject of service on this that brings us to the second part of christ the mystery of god revealed first part god revealing himself to his people second part having the preeminence in that body of believers see in this we get that scripture and the head and he is jesus is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell all right so there is colossians 2 9 in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bottle 10th verse says that now you we are complete in christ who is the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in christ and have um where please the father in him should dwell all the fullness and having made uh made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now have he reconciled and the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreportable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which we have was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul and maybe minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god that is still the commission we have today that is still the commission given to us today fulfilling that word of god even the mystery as it is his fault as it has been spoken in history which has been killed from ages and from generations but is now made manifest to the saints now what was that that was hid and what was that that was made manifest christ god the invisible god untouchable by man unable to understand comprehend by man became tangible that was the great mystery that was hid all that time all those years now become known how has it become known oh you can look back and you can see adam's part you can see god's part in the garden of eden with the lamps you can see you can see the pascal lamp like we said earlier and you can see the the pillar of cloud by a day and the pillar of fire by night the children as you can see the the melchizedek and the one that came to abraham and discerned the thoughts of the tent behind him uh you you saw the paschal lamb and the the sacrificial lamb you you see isaiah talking about him coming forth and then coming and then that prophecy coming true where a virgin did conceive brought forth a man child all those things that paul is talking about has now been made known now it is not a mystery but it is manifested what is manifested uncovered or revealed to the saints it's not for everybody he came to those that were his own you read the bible he came to those that were his own to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to the work which worketh in me mightily that work of christ that now i'm working in each one of us that proves who he is showing jesus the same yesterday today and forever he was the same yesterday amen different form still god today he was when he walked here he is today he will be through eternity the same yesterday today and forever if god revealed that to us to see that in him lays lays the responsibility for us to know who we are today it was imperative for john the baptist to do what he did and declare jesus and for them to follow jesus and not john the forerunner of the first coming of christ it was imperative upon the second run of the first of the second the first the forerunner the second coming of christ brother branham to do the exact same thing to point a bride to jesus christ there's people in this country there's people in this world there's people all over that say brother bran appointed people to himself and made this that lied about this that whatever the only thing that that man tried to do the most was to get people to understand who they were and jeru and and for jesus christ to be revealed to them and for them to follow christ and not him if that's not a message i don't know what is but that was what it was brought to us so that it could be revealed to us that we could know because if if we can't see the revelation of that word then how are we ever going to see us revealed in that word how are we ever going to see ourselves in the word how can we ever see ourselves being the word unless we can see and recognize what god has done where it is today what's going on in our lives today where we're at in this end time where are we friend is a late hour and we're in this last days god unfolding himself god revealing himself those scriptures i wanted to read to you maybe next week we can transition if the lord terry's into that part into the next part and uh and and try to get into that preeminence that god wants to have in his body of believers that that falls squarely on our shoulders friend now this far this first part god condensating himself into the place that he could reveal himself to his people you that that was that was god working that work and and in that god created the the vehicle the possibility to bring the second part to past which is to have preeminence in us and to live in us amen so lord whitley maybe next time we'll get get to that place and and friend just try to try to do we what we can define to see ourselves in the word to see ourselves in christ and to know our position today this brian's not going to go anywhere until she knows who she is and and getting to that place that we know who she is we got to know where we came from who we are and what's going on today and what god's done for us where he's brought us from all these mysteries we talk about are simply contained in this one lord jesus christ other people and some father son holy ghost who were they it could be any father i'm a son i'm a father i'm a human being but if this one man is contained all this one lord jesus christ died and gave himself for us amen in him contains it all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen praise the lord so god bless you today i prayed son pray something once said to bless you help you in some way today god is good to us god's blessed us revealed himself to us shown us his word help us to see that word and then that word would be revealed to us that it would be recognizable of who we are in him amen god richly bless you let's bow our heads for a moment of prayer if we could now precious jesus father we're so thankful god today that in my little in our little humanity feeble pea brain efforts lord it what you do for so transcend transcends that lord and brings it all to the place that it has to be a revelation it has to be something that transcends just human knowledge or something that we learn i thought it's something that only you can do and in doing all of this for us lord you've brought it to pass just as i believe you brought it to pass to them there the disciples they didn't have a full grasp of it maybe like the bride and we do this last day lord but they had what they needed for that day and and peter stood forth and said you are the christ the son of the living god they knew that and it was something that they lived upon lord and god we know today what you've given and through the word that you brought us this message of the hour father that did nothing but point us to you thank you lord for helping unfold manifest reveal those things that we can see who you are lord not just in the similarity of the human or just in the form of a man or something and a good man or a prophet or something but lord is god almighty veiled in flesh the beginning the creation of god thank you today lord for speaking to us from your word thank you for these that have been a part of this service god i pray that you had blessed it to us exceedingly lord and help us lord to do only what would be according to your perfect will for our lives keep us all heads to protect the lord from all the germs we don't diseases a fear lord because we know that you are with us lord we do ask your protection and your help and leadership and for some place you'd have us not to go lord i pray you'd warn us lord and keep us from it but lord keep us in your protective care help lead us in goddess according to your perfect will for all of our lives god move upon and request every need it's upon the people in the hearts of the
