even think to tell to put that type that last verse in here praise the lord but i'm so glad he set us free amen i'm so glad he loosed the chains that bound us amen and liberated us to serve and to worship him praise the lord you know there's brothers and sisters in christ are living in countries today that don't have the liberties that we have and i'm so thankful to be here to be in this country as far down as it's gone and as far down as it'll continue to go it's still the greatest in the world in my opinion i'm so thankful to have that liberty and that freedom to be able to worship him amen thank you jesus we have a couple of prayer requests to mention to you today god amen sister sherida had texted me a little earlier and said that alice was up most of the night not feeling well she threw up said she's doing better this morning but they were going to stay home and uh alice gets thinking about it alice is going to get some rest uh make sure all is well with healing there so let's just continue to remember them in prayer if we could uh sister alice also sister julie had texted me and uh she said that uh she had a really bad headache this morning when she woke up she's been uh not feeling well and throwing up so it's remember sister julian prayer this morning as well the lord would just touch her also she has to request a prayer for a co-worker first named greg he texted her and said he really needed a touch from the lord didn't say whether spiritual physical financial i don't know but greg had enough confidence in julie having enough confidence in us that we would bring him before the lord and that god would just move on his behalf and touch him and the situation in his life this morning and also her of course remember her and prayer is not feeling well amen brother danny wrote out a request here says please pray for the people of ukraine thank you again buddy uh pray for the people of ukraine they are one of the bravest people on earth russia is a lot more powerful uh than ukraine has it outmanned and they are willing to die for their country that's the truth brother and uh zielinski that president he is set right there yeah amen even though putin's threatening to come and cut his head off he's staying right there i'll tell you it's a lot different than the ukrainian situation they they hit the hills but uh you're right brother they're very brave people as bombs were following a group of ukrainians huddled by a big rock started praying uh we never give up hope that is the truth amen there are believers i believe voice of god has put out memos about the believers that are over in ukraine and i'm sure there's probably believers in russia that that will be adversely affected by what's going on as well so let's just remember them in prayer if the lord would just touch them and continue to keep their hand his hand on them amen we all need it don't we amen i mean they feel the immediate effects of it friend but this will reverberate around the world uh this will have this not only in europe and uh but all around the world this this will reverberate around the world i think it already has begun but you know uh remember what brother branham said remember what god said god showed brother branham that was one of the political visions that god had gave brother branham watch russia watch russia yes watch russia amen at that time russia was the soviet union it wasn't even russia right but notice now today it is named russia yes and that voice that prophecy that god prophecy watch russia yes watch russia so we know amen we can't lose vision of that saints that's from god almighty watch russia praise the lord so we see that that's happening today what are we supposed to watch for amen watch for what's happening all the all the disturbance everything that's happening when they go down to get that oil that's exactly what's going on today yes uh brother dennis is this a um is this a testimony this is a testament i just i usually say the testimonies for a little for afterwards so i'll have the prayer request first and then we'll go to the testimony so amen so we remember that amen remember those people and keep them in prayer if we could amen and i had unspoken requests on your heart amen let's stand to our feet if we could amen and just keep these knees before our hearts we have brother dennis pray for us today and lord jesus we borrow our hearts and heads in unison of the faith knowing that we serve a living god yes that's mindful of our needs and lord we know we're in the last hours of your coming your bride the rapture is imminent and the dead in christ will show themselves soon i believe and father this is a time to be serious in our walk with you not to take anything for granted or to even in any way get mixed up with the things of the world help us father to be the best christian that we can ever be and father us believers being assembled together is a good sign that we want to be better christians yes you said you assemble ourselves together the more so as you see that day approaching what is it gonna take to wake up your people father and lord we are needy people we know we serve a god a five-star general that's leading the way yes we know that there's so much that's happening there's only one fear that the pride stands with it's the fear of god to do your will father yes and lord help us to recognize the day and the hour and the message has come forth then the carcass has come the eagles are feeding on it and lord help us not to be in any way uh complacent likes a days ago to make any excuse why we cannot obey your word because it's your work in us that makes us obedient it's your battle that gives us a victory father yes and lord there are needs has been expressed there are some that need a healing touch for father you are a great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of my infirmities and with your strides we are you you want us to stand on your word you want us to take you at your word and father we stand for our healing we stand for our deliverance from mental anguish we stand for our needs to be met jehovah jairo for them they might need financial uh needs father or them that need they're so spiritual warfare i heard my sister say all these demons it seems like they're fighting us everywhere we go and lord we have our our spiritual warfare our armor that you have given us as you prophesy it's a spiritual armor help us to recognize that lord we are victorious we are more than conquerors in the name of jesus yes hallelujah in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen thank you lord jesus praise the lord you can be seated if you'd like amen amen praise the lord god is mindful of us isn't he amen praise the lord jesus micah has a short testimony he wants to give everyone um here just for a moment i just want to thank you all for praying for me for my instance licensing and get a job so a couple months back coming out of safeway up at an oracle on this one side roads i saw a insurance agency sign and somebody told me that i get my license to call them so thursday i called them and she was like well just come talk to me i don't it wasn't an interview or anything so i i've been in industry forever and i love helping new agents so i met with her friday got there at 10 30 didn't leave till three o'clock um doing a bunch of talking um ultimately they decided to take me on as an agent and she's she's nazarene but still very much a nominal christian she said she's been praying for a new agent so lord just worked it all out and they're giving me a bunch of different tasks she's going to because right now i have my health and life lines of authority she's going to pay for me to get my property casually which is like auto home stuff like that so that way i can have all of that book of business she's going to let me use her office to do my own personal business for health and life and i'm taking on their website their marketing and stuff as well that they're going to pay me for so towards opening doors for me so i think him for doing it and you all perfect praise the lord jesus so thankful god's mindful whitney always works on both ends testimony from brother dennis he said this past tuesday as i was coming down the stairs my feet went out from under me as i hid the tall floor i landed uh and i landed face first but my face did not hit the floor because i landed on my right shoulder and arm and i thought i had even broken my arm but praise the lord the impact was so hard i just badly bruised myself no serious injuries and today it's still sore but i can now slowly raise my arm and feel the pain is gradually diminishing knowing god does watch and take care of his own amen praise the lord jesus a little bit different brother dennis than when maybe joel or emma fall it's a little different than when we were a little younger and fell uh doesn't heal quite as quickly amen sister norma has a praise report here as well i said i would like to give the lord lord god all the glory for his mercy and grace to us ronnie daniel kathy and myself yesterday coming home from prescott area daniel our son-in-law was driving us home and we were on i-10 and the road was bumper to bumper with vehicles when there was a loud pop or bang i heard kathy yelled daniel daniel the car in front of us suddenly came to a dead stop on the highway daniel hit his brakes and was completely stopped uh also my mind went blank and the only thing i could think of is lord help us i sat quietly waiting for a car semi truck to hit us in the back which didn't happen thank the lord we didn't get hurt killed or or even have an accident thank you jesus walk mercy to us thank god for a small voice to warn us uh going to be emergency uh two or three times i had to tell him i had to tell the lord i placed myself in his hands and trust him for whatever he has amen or whatever it was praise the lord thank god another keeping us safe keeping us in his hands amen watching over and blessing us there's nothing like being a christian saints people sometimes will say oh those were just circumstances all those things just happen no they don't and no they don't not to a christian they don't amen they happen for a reason and purpose and the lord has his hands on it all right amen praise the lord we had a good uh good memorial service last night i think sister and t sister lydia for coming and being there as a part of it it was a really good service i i believe things went real well and i really enjoyed hearing so much of the family get up and talk about their dad and their brother and uh it spoke a lot to me about the charlie i didn't know and and i appreciated that and and the kind of man that he was um there's uh a couple of more things i usually get a couple of extras for you if you would like to have one i only have two more or two or three more back there on the table uh maybe you can look up there's a lot of nice pictures in here it's very unusual most of these just have an order of service or something but they put a lot of nice pictures in here of him and his family and all and i thought it was very well done so uh this was him i don't know how he was here i never got to ask sister teresa but uh not sure how old he was here but he's closer to that now than he was when he left us i told i told billy i said that's you you remember billy who came here a few weeks ago their son and sat here had the gray that looked just like him i mean he looked just like his dad there but it was a good service really enjoyed it uh well attended and appreciate the tucson tabernacle for opening their doors uh and allowing us to have it there also uh i had an extra card i think back there too if anybody wants it a little memorial card that they had for brother brother charlie born september 29 1947 past january 27th uh 2022 amen enjoy the testimonies to how uh they were at a lucky's grocery store remember lucky's yeah he used to live it was a lucky's right across the street from when we moved to tucson at orange grove in oracle i used to go in there and get some thrifty ice cream but that's where she met charlie she's sitting in the parking lot i think as the story goes and he walked out helping her mom with groceries and the lord spoke to teresa and said that's going to be your husband i said praise the lord that's that's outstanding amen happens a few times happened to me i know that didn't happen to her sorry but it happened to me i knew when we were in high school she was going to be my wife everybody's joking and she's denying it oh y'all are going to get married jesus dying and in my heart i'm saying yeah we are 36 going on 37 years now yes i was right about something i wasn't right he's the one who told me amen so he's the one that's always right amen praise the lord let's sing his song amen before we change the service today another he set me free amen set me free praise the lord amen thank you jesus if you're watching again if you're at home with a song book is 388 i mean if you want to look at the psalm book here we'll have the words up here once like a bird let's sing it to him [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] glory to god he sets me free [Music] [Music] [Music] glory to god he set me free [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] set me [Music] praise the lord jesus ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free praise the lord jesus amen thank god for that the truth has come back today is living in us yes amen thank you jesus praise the lord he set us free today so thankful he watches over us and he keeps us in his protective care amen hallelujah such a privilege to be people today saints amen such a privileged people to be called by his name praise the lord jesus let's stand now if we could we'll go to the scripture amen go to the bible today hebrews chapter 10. amen like to say as we get started here i really thoroughly enjoyed brother roger last week uh that message was just outstanding i really appreciate the lord using brother roger and appreciate him giving himself to the lord and you and the lord using him to speak to us yes amen praise the lord jesus we're going over to uh hebrews again hebrews chapter 10. amen we're going to read a couple of verses of scripture here starting with the 25th verse hebrews chapter 10 verse 25. you love the lord jesus praise the lord so thankful he's with us hebrews chapter 10 verse 25 before we let us bow our heads for another word prayer for good precious lord jesus so thankful again today father for what you've given to us done for us and your presence in our lives your continual perpetual presence that's in our lives lord you never leave us or forsake us god and we're so thankful that we can trust in you have that peace of understanding lord that you're here and that you're watching and guiding us through all of the things that we see that's going on in the world today truly lord it's a time it's a trying time it's a it's a waking up time lord it's a time of reckoning it's it's a time of knowing who we are lord yes it is certainly not a time to be playing church it is certainly not a time to be straddling offense it is certainly not a time to try to pretend like we're something that we're not god this is a serious hour that we're living lord this is a serious day god and lord i pray that lord somehow today every one of us in our own lives lord would cinch up that much closer to you lord and in your image and in your likeness and become more like you and lord let this word come into our lives and power and manifestation lord let it be done here in this congregation today father that you would sweep through this place lord once again and fill all this house oh god and feel the pulsation of the holy ghost running through us lord and and taking every life and every heart lord and healing and mending and blessing and strengthening but revealing your word to our heart lord and give us the strength to continue to press this battle to press this mark to press towards that prize lord that our precious brother charlie has already attained today yes lord it's all it's there looking waiting for us oh god that we get to that place lord let this time be a little portion of that as we draw closer to you bless these your people lord that if here today that have come put forth the effort lord help those who may be streaming not able to come lord we just commit everyone to you when we do we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt him or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory the honor and the praise for all that is said and done here today yes for it is in is uh in your precious name the name of the lord jesus christ that we do these and we say these things that we gather together you promise to be here lord and we know that you are so let your word lord accomplish in us what you have for uh to accomplish today we committed to you and we thank you for it now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen hebrews chapter 10 we'll begin reading with verse 25 in hebrews 10 verse 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that they're approaching and boy don't we for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for a judgment of fiery indignation which shall devire devour the adversaries you can be seated if you like amen i want to talk about uh entitled this today uh something the lord had put on my heart a couple of weeks ago called misinformation uh misinformation i guess for lack of any other title uh that's just what i want to call this today misinformation because it's it's going around it's around the country especially and it seems like that everybody today wants to be the arbiters of truth everybody wants to be the ones to be the ones that are listened to the ones that are believed the ones that say that they are the ones spewing and spouting the truth everybody thinks that they know what the truth is everybody thinks that they have the truth when in reality the only ones that truly have and know the truth is the christian amen is the true holy ghost born again filled christian amen those are the ones because they realize what the truth is and others they think they have truth and they want to let you know that everything else that you're hearing other than what they're saying is misinformation oh it's it's misinformation what is misinformation and see what it really break it down what really is misinformation well if you look up in the dictionary misinformation is classified as this false or inaccurate information well that's kind of a given right false or inaccurate information but where does that information derive from again who has taken it upon themselves to become the arbiters of what truth is or what misinformation is who has given that person who has given that organization who has given that news organization or that politician or that banker or that who has given these people the right to become the arbiters of what truth is right how do they know what misinformation is maybe they're misinformed maybe they misunderstood but yet they people presented as though this is the absolute fact and truth and anything else other than what i'm telling you is wrong it's misinformation who died and made them the boss i mean that's that's the thing i've heard for many years who died and made them the arbiters who's the one that that relinquished what real truth is over to their hands that they can stand forth and say listen to us and everything else is lies who'll give them that authority who'd get who had put them in that position nobody that i know of except themselves because they have a microphone or a camera or some way that they can spew whatever they want to to the world amen the only way that they the only way it's like brother rogers said last week the only power the devil has is what we give him right he has no power whatsoever he's very deceiving and deceptive and beguiling but he has no power at all only power he has is what you relinquish to it well the only power any of these people have to try to get before you and say that they're the arbiters of truth is the power that you give them right it's the power that people give them if you give them that power they will use that to bring misinformation you say how do you know it's misinformation because if it's not according to this it's misinformation amen the second part of the definition of misinformation is false or inaccurate information especially especially that which is meant to deliberately deceive now that got my attention because that you can look at it and say who is the deceiver amen who is the deceiver the deceiver is not the president the deceiver is not the news organization the deceiver is not the the minister of the spouting misinformation the deceiver is satan satan's the deceiver now he has all of these outlets that he's able to use to spew his misinformation but satan is the one that is out to deliberately deceive just like he did in the garden of eden where did misinformation start in the garden of eden that's right when he told her 99 of the truth that was all true what he told her oh yeah that you shall become gods you shall no good for me well you shall know he was absolutely right but he changed one word from what god's word says one word that one word changed every bit of the tone of what he was saying and brought it into a misinformation to deliberately deceive deliberately deceived and to understand that's exactly the motive that satan has today the same motive he had in the garden of eden is the same motive he has for this world for this country and for you if you'll listen to it he wants to bring misinformation in your life yes people say oh i've heard from god have you does it match this does it match this because this matches this this is the message this matches this if it doesn't match this i'm afraid we got a problem misinformation it's not it sometimes people do things like that and they and they bring it forth and it's not necessarily meant to deliberately deceive but the person the one who is sent forth to try to deliberately deceive you is the devil right and he'll use all kind of means to do it like i said he'll use people of authority he'll use churches he'll use people to claim that they have certain gifts he'll use governments he'll use presidents he'll use anything right down to even 99 of the truth to try to deceive you that's inside the deceptions exactly what he's shooting for because deception will get you off the path that you should be on deception will get you away from the word because the word is a straight narrow path deception takes you off of that path and if you can if you go off of that path you have to come back where you got off or you're going to continue to be deceived right and that deception is going to lead you into the darkness that is against the word it may look like something that you've twisted that brother branham said or that the the bible says but it really is something that's off of the the spirit and the of the letter of the word to bring misinformation to deliberately deceive to get you away from the word because he knows that you and the word are becoming one he's no match for that he's no match for you he's no match for the word amen your mere presence should absolutely shudder the devil every one of his minion demons your mere presence should call the devil to knock on his knees so hardy bruise them right now obviously physical application but you understand what i'm saying yes your presence just because of you being the word yes the misinformation is to take you away from that look what about look what it says in revelation here revelation chapter 22 verse 18. revelation 22 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man anybody doesn't matter who it is i don't care how who they claim to be i don't care how long they've been preaching i don't care what kind of gift they claim to have i don't care how big their church is i don't care how much they can talk and speak and great orchards and claim to come then have the lld's and the degrees and i don't care if they've been ascended to the highest realms of the power in the world or it doesn't matter any man any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of this book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so what is god telling us the seriousness of this situation the seriousness of this misinformation the position of taking of becoming an arbiter of what truth is one word one word added one word subtracted you see the the judgment that befalls somebody that tries to become that arbiter leading people astray one word well it's not rocket science does we know what happened in the big art and the garden of eden in the beginning that's exactly the way his tactics were then he hasn't changed his tactics he's the same devil today he does the same way today exactly this evening now he's been coming along with more cunning and crafting and trying to deceive more but one word that's all it takes one word any added any subtracted so what is that where does that put us if we're not speaking the word then what are we speaking right if it's not the word then what is it it's misinformation if you want to be an arbiter of truth then that truth is going to derive from this scripture that's what truth is yes anything outside of that is not true because look friend truth let's just go back to let's just go back to the garden of eden why don't we do that in genesis chapter four genesis chapter four adding subtracting self-appointed arbiters an arbiter now is something of ultimate authority someone who claims to or feels like they have ascended to the point of being the ultimate authority the ultimate authority it's amazing how everybody seems to have the ultimate authority on everything of course everybody tries today to point to science and reason and medicine and all that when we know that how we know they themselves will even admit how quickly science and medicine changes because they gain more knowledge and as they gain more knowledge things change and as things change what was a couple of weeks ago isn't today but yet over here they claim to be the arbiters of truth we have exactly what you need well two weeks later they find out well that might not have been exactly what you needed why because they're not the arbiters of you yes the arbiter of truth says by my stripes you're healed that's arbitrary truth that that is true nobody can dispute that that is a fact now if people want to try to come and and and make it something that it's not well then that becomes misinformation all it takes is one word add it or subtract it and that becomes misinformation because that's not the truth the truth is in contained in this word now look uh genesis chapter four so there is no there is only one ultimate authority yes we know that yes there's only one ultimate authority and we know it's not the news we know it's not the government we know it's not it's not any of us amen there's only one truth praise the lord genesis chapter 4. let's begin with verse 1. and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was the keeper of the sheep but cain was the tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought up the first things of his flock and of the fact thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto canaan to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wrong and his countenance fell the lord said unto cain why art thou wrote and why is thou countenance followed if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted my mind talking to the serpent seed himself giving him a space to repent giving the very serpent seed the opportunity to repent right now you want to talk about the grace of god friend and that there is no greater grace of god than god going to the devil himself and saying if you'll just do right i'll accept you right wow if people want to try to take god's grace and make a disgrace out of it oh lord help us god is telling you if thou shalt do well thou shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well senteth lie that the door and unto thee shall his desire and thou shalt rule over him be his desire rule over him what is that grace of god telling us that grace of god is telling us that it extends as far as anybody will receive it right as long as it's received and accepted for the condition for the purpose god gives it forth not just to live any kind of life and be any kind of thing and do whatever you want and the grace of god will cover it no no no no to receive it as it's given to us in the word as god has given it it'll extend to anybody that's willing to receive it right brother branham said if satan will come through the blood and be your brother yes but he can't he won't he refuses to which takes us back to our first scripture he refuses to he knows what is right now look at cain here cain a derivative of that seed the first child unbelief the first the sin that came in and infiltrated in the garden of eden cain was that one who felt like he now became the arbiter of truth now you know my story my story scripturally when cain and abel were born they were twins one of the serpent one of adam and when they came forth i believe that adam being the son of god adam took his sons and treated them i i would think out of respect the same as i would do my son my children take them to the garden of eden show them all the things god did show the animals and abel this this fellow over here he's a lion i named him a lion because he's always lying around no i don't know my name but he landed he named him that for a reason could be i don't know but he named it that i named it because so and so see this giraffe look at his neck see this king and he's talking i believe these are his sons he's talking he's taking them around he's showing them the garden of eden he's still the fruit trees and you know god told us that we could do this and not this and you know all that all that uh all that a man do with his sons all that all that a man would teach his sons and i believe that that he told him about the fall and what had happened and what caused the fall and and the only way that him and their mother were able to come back out into the presence of god again albeit not the same way that they did before but at least in that in in that presence again was it god himself took the sheep and he slew the sheep and he took the bloody sheepskin and threw them in for adam and eve to come out and be able to come into his presence again not the same way as it was because they were separated at that time that fellowship could never be the same again not at that time not till jesus came could not be the same again but that bloody sheepskin is what was acceptable to god because god's the one that did it right adam didn't do it he didn't do it god did it right it was god's decision that it took blood the life of an innocent one to allow the the sinner to come back into god's presence again don't you think adam relayed that to his sons don't you think or to cain and abel don't you think he told them let them know i know i'm adding to the word but just paraphrase a little bit dramatizing i i believe he did i mean just in actuality told them this is what happened this is what happened cain though rejected what his dad said it's revelation uh relevant uh hebrews 11 4 tells us that by by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain well we know faith is a revelation right something that was revealed to them when adam was telling uh uh cain and abel abel got a revelation how did david get to revelation because he was of the seed of god how did cain not get that revelation because he was the seed of man he was the seed of the serpent right amen he didn't have that revelation he didn't have that understanding it was by revelation that cain received that uh that uh understanding of what was pleasing to the lord but even after god came to king and accepted abel's sacrifice and not cain's instead of correcting his misbehavior he rebelled right he became the arbiter of truth he rejected what his dad told him he rejected what his brother did he rejected what god told him he rejected god's grace he spurned god's grace and it was nothing left for cain at that time but judgment right he himself became the arbiter of truth i'm going to do it the way i want to do it and i don't care what you say god i'm going to do it the way i want to do it i don't care what that bible says oh you people i don't believe brother around was not a prophet's old-fashionedness there's nothing to that i believe it the way i want to believe it and people today are becoming their own gods they're becoming their own arbiters of truth just like cain did in the garden of eden he became his own armature of truth and rejected every bit of truth that was around him right to accept his own misinformation his own lie that he had cooked up in his mind to think that this i'm gonna do it this way god if you don't like it i don't care my isn't that just the same attitude people have today i'm going to do it the way i want i don't care what you say i'm going to do it however i want i'm going to act however more i'm going to live how i want and i don't care what anybody says preacher can preach what he wants bible can say what he wants i don't care if god it shall come i'm going to do it the way i want to do it and people live their lives exactly that way yes so much to the point that they just don't even believe in god anymore and their actions testify to it i don't care what their lips say their actions testify that they do not believe they do not believe in a god they do not believe in an almighty god of judgment who is the truth and the arbiter of truth can become his own arbiter people today are becoming their own arbiters of truth well i'll believe this part of the bible but i don't want to hear this part of the bible oh why is it why is the old testament even there to begin with we shouldn't even be following that old testament if without didn't have the old you wouldn't have the news that's right amen and without the types and shadows of the old how do we even see and understand what the new even means what god's even doing through when jesus is here and on and why we're here today i've heard brothers i've told you this before i've heard brothers say oh that's the old testament do you still sacrifice i said i absolutely do every time i go to church every day of my life i try i offer spiritual sacrifices unto my god giving praise in my lips amen i absolutely do now i don't take an animal and slit his throat and go build an altar and slit his throat and all the things that they did in the old testament but i take the spiritual application that there was in the old testament and applied in my life amen amen just like i do other things because it's the word of god they've become their own arbiters of truth by saying well i i i'll do this but i'm not going to do that i'll take this part of the word but i'm not going to take that part of the word and then when you stole them in the new testament that it's a follow-up of what's in the old well i you know that that's that's an allegory you know it didn't really mean it like that well you want to what do you say to somebody like that right they've become their own arbiters of the truth they don't want to hear the truth they don't want to know the truth the the truth in them are not on speaking terms and all that they have all that they know all that they give is a bunch of misinformation and all they have to do is find another little group of people who believe the same way and they form a little group and they're just a big group of misinformed people yes dares i say lost without christ they will be lost yes it's the same you got today you got half this country believing well probably even more than that it's just nothing but lies the things that's going on it's just nothing but lies it is what they want it to be see misinformation doesn't mean that it's that it's false information you know that misinformation isn't completely just something that's false misinformation can also be withholding facts about a subject that is pertinent to what you're telling them if you're withholding something that's valuable in what you're giving to people if you're withholding that not telling them that's misinformation right because they can't make an informed decision with only half the details right you got to know the whole story to understand what is actually happening what's unfolded now just like cain the world is doing the same thing god's coming down and saying if you'll just do what i tell you i will accept you and they're spurning every bit of grace god is trying to show to them yes they're rejecting it and remember brother graham said when you spurn grace there's nothing left but judgment yes right those who receive the knowledge of the truth and reject it remains no more sacrifice for sin people a lot of times put try to figure that out friend but it's really not hard listen to this two different powers of transformation or this is a power transformation god said our brother branham said cain was such a person religious indeed certainly but he had the wrong seed in him see and therefore it brought forth the serpent seed satan had hissed over his seat of uh of eden and that's what brought forth the king he put he's he's not at the brown tabernacle so he words it a little differently than he normally would uh basically he said satan had hissed over this seed we know what happened he's uh he's just in a different place so he's he's tamping his words down a little bit i guess and that's what brought forth the king he put his poison upon it look now he cain knew the perfect will of god he knew the perfect will of god came to it but he refused to do it there you go hebrews 10 26 knew the perfect will of god and refused to do it people worry about that scripture sometimes people think that maybe they cross that line no no don't don't get that in your mind but now if you've received the knowledge of the truth and you absolutely flat out reject it you don't want to have anything to do it brother brown said cain knew the perfect will of god and refused to do it right from his daddy or well we'll say daddy from his stepdad from adam from his brother who who according if we take the scripture chronologically cain's sacrifice came first but after abel offered his sacrifice and god accepted abels and rejected cain's don't you think oh i see what's acceptable to god now abel would you mind me using one of your sheep i want to offer the same sacrifice but he didn't humble himself to do that and a lot of times that's one of the biggest things missing in people today is humility people don't want to humble themselves people don't want to humble themselves to the truth of god's word people don't want to humble themselves to a to a a message or or to a truth today people want to be built up in themselves oh i got it i know it i this is it and and they put a period at the end of their revelation you put a period at the end of your revelation you don't know my god you don't know the real god because my god does not have a period at the end yes he has a comma maybe or to be continued but he doesn't have a period because he's god almighty he's omnipotent all-knowing omniscient omnipresent he's infinite he's all-knowing he's all-powerful he's god how can that have an end there's no period to it people put a period on it and said this is it other than that become the arbiters of truth they self-appointed themselves the arbiter of truth all they have to do is have a few people listen to them but cain refused to do it he proved them to be the serpent seed when the scene uh when he seen the perfect will of god he refused it he had seen god's vindicate god vindicate abel's message he know that that was the will of god he saw it he saw god vindicated and what did god say to him he said if you'll just do the same thing and do worship like your brother you'll do well i will receive you yes that's the same thing he says to people today i will receive you if you just accept it the way that that's pleasing to me am i and people don't care they don't want to be pleasing to god why i don't know power popularity money you name it why do people do these things just flat out rejected to pride to humble themselves to the will of god too prideful to humble themselves to to the simplicity of the word god help us he was too prideful he was of the wrong seed if you do the same thing then then you do well now god's power to transform this is a a little earlier he preached these within a few weeks of each other god's power to transform but notice cain come to worship but he had the wrong seed in him now notice remember brother branham said when they came they built the altar just the same and brought the best he said he's just as sincere as he could be kane was just as sincere as abel built this built the altar and everything was just perfect exactly the way it was supposed to be everything he was just as religious he was just as pious he played the part he looked the part but when he come to the sacrifice when it comes to the thing that god looked at and accepted or rejected he could not do it he had no revelation he was willing to have church he was willing to have a big steeple building glass-stained windows he was willing to do all of the uh the things that needed to be done but the sacrifices where he fell short and that's exactly where people fall short today they want church oh people are okay with church they're okay with going to a building don't touch any of my life now like i was saying last night people wanted people want a god that'll be their savior but they don't want a god that'll be their lord right they don't want a god that will tell them what to do they don't want a god that will make them humble themselves and die to themselves so that they take up the mantle of christ and live by his spirit and by his will cain come to worship but he had the wrong seed him serpent seed the his of the serpent had hissed over him for the seed of the uh the seed of the woman he knew the perfect will of god but refused to do it he said did you know that listen now knows the will of god but just refuses to do it come on well if satan knows well god refuses to do it don't his children do the same yes the children will be the same satan knows the will of god but he just refuses to do it well then that's where you fall hebrews 10 26 that's where people fall they know the truth and they just flat refuse to do it i'm just not going to do it i'm not going to live that way i'm not going to accept it like that now some people say oh i can't live like that well what you're saying is you're not going to live like that right because the bottom line is you can if you want to people do what they want to do i found that out long time ago people are going to do what they want to do that's just happens the way it is and unfortunately it happens way too many times and if god's not a part of it see and that's where people have a a lot of people have a problem they want now follow my thought here they want god to be a part of their life and they do they're a lot of people they're sincere and wanting god to be a part of their life but they don't want god to be their life i don't want god to be a part of my life i want him to be my life he's either my life or nothing right not just a part of my life if you've got god as a part of your life well then you can put him here or take him out here well if you don't want him over here just pull him out you know if you don't like god here he just you just fit him in where you can and that's what people do yes they just fit god in wherever they can because he's only a part of their life he's not their life right if he's your life you'll be obedient do whatever he says be led by his spirit follow his word humble ourselves to obedience if he's our life if we are dead and he is alive in us then that's that's how we obey him that's how we live our lives but people most people just want him as a part of their life right i just i just want you over here god when i'm sick i need you to i need you to heal me uh when i need a raise at my job lord just speak to that man lord if i need some guy he's just i need you then you know then then oh prolonged god can just but that's just they just stick him in here and stick him in there and and he's just all this the rest of their time they're just going about their lives not even recognize or acknowledge that god even exists even people do that about the message amen satan knows the will of god he just refuses to do it how many people the same way god have mercy there remains no more sacrifice for sin at that point you know it won't do it no sacrifice for sin or rejections he had seen god vindicate abel's message now i want you to think use your thinking man's filter now for a minute abel's correct message that god vindicated to be the truth abel's message had been received and cain sought and knew that god had vindicated but he just refused to do it same thing today they've become the arbiters of their truth a man was baffled one day about this i'll close here in just a few minutes a man was baffled about this didn't understand it most probably the most powerful man on earth at the time saint john chapter 18. st john chapter 18. we'll begin reading uh verse 33. saint john 18 33 then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it of me pilate answered him am i a jew thine old nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done well see they became the arbiters of truth that's why they delivered christ to pilate because they were the arbiters of truth right at that point you're even even your chief priests have delivered you unto me what have you done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hens pilate therefore said unto him art thou that a king then jesus answered if thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth the truth there's only one the truth it's not uttered by buddha it's not uttered by muhammad it's not uttered by any arbiter of their own truth in the world today there's only one truth it's not a written letter it's not in script it's not something anybody's uttered it's not something that's been projected or broadcast there's only one thing truth and that truth is a person that person is jesus christ amen that's the only the truth that exists he is jesus he is the arbiter of the truth because he is the truth and if what we're giving what we're saved what we're doing doesn't reflect him and this word then it is misinformation and it is not an arbiter of truth right an ultimate authority an ultimate type host amen i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice aren't you thank god for the truth thank god for jesus christ yeah thank god for being a part of that thank god that i can put my name right there everyone you and bennett is of the truth because he hears my voice you put your name there you are off the truth because you hear his voice because you recognize every other voice is a lie and his is the truth he said that every man's word be a lot his words be true that word that truth is a person remember used to be a man was only as good as his word people lie don't think anything about it anymore it it it's so it's so sad give me this little caveat here that society and in a godly nation that people have gotten so loosed from their morals and the truth that lying and stealing mean nothing to people anymore i installed a ring doorbell on what was my client mary's house or son selling it i did a lot of work over there and i had to download an app to put the doorbell in well that app i guess i'm a member of now i get ring uh alerts all the time from around the neighborhood of things that happen lost dog or uh stuff like that and i can't tell you how many times i get alerts because of people just stealing a package off somebody's front porch thinking nothing about it some people come and they're all uh covered up and masked and all this stuff and they come and they they grab the package and they run and some people just walk up to the front door and they'd grab it smile on the camera and leave they don't care absolutely do not care you know why because they know nothing's going to happen to them yeah doesn't matter anymore and the sheer disregard people stare to death about russia people stare to death about china friend to this nation absolutely enemies to this nation but to a child of god the thing that's become the worst to this nation is ourselves yes this nation has destroyed itself not russia yeah russia hasn't destroyed people used to be scared to death of communism i'm not for communism i hate it but this nation was destroyed by communism there's a rise of people mostly young people that want socialism in our country even sitting in congress and they believe socialism or communism is the way that we should go that's not killing this country what killed this country was ourselves right when we rejected as a nation when we rejected god in this message we rejected him yes and when we rejected him what happens when spur uh grace has spurned judgment it's been in our judgment ever since and our morals and our ethics and our have all just downhill down yeah now if you're not careful a little infiltrated in our lives you just tell a lie and say oh i just told a little white lie no there is no such thing eliza lie yes amen blue green yellow purple whatever color you want to put on it is still alive and people lie don't even think anything about it it means nothing to them anymore why just it it's a little bit of a light if it's a lie it's a life ranger if you're giving it to deceive people that's misinformation it's a lie it's not true i don't care what color it is right and it means nothing to people anymore to lie our presidents our government they lie all the time the people that claim to be the arbiters of truth and and news programs every day they lie just lie lie they don't care you know why they don't care cause no repercussion right why do people go in and smash these counters and take all the jewelry and all this stuff out run out the door why why do people go in the cvs's in the walgreens with bags and come out loaded with bags full of stuff and just walk out the door my wife saw it over here at burlington and just took stuff just walked out the door she saw it he just walked out the door yeah you know just having a nice day let's see their music or whatever just going to go have a bird or go fence some of the stuff they just stole to go to panda or something they don't care yeah absolutely no moral about it it's sad but it's where the nation has become why because people think that they know better people have come to the place that they think they know better right and when you get to the place that you know better than god we're lost friends we are lost pilate said unto him what is truth what is truth truth's not a what truth is a who truth is a person truth is jesus the truth was standing right there in front of pilate he's asking truth what is true why because at that moment this man is the arbiter of his own truth because he's powerful he's in charge he's the one who makes the rules he's the one that breaks the rules he's the one that says what comes and goes your life even told jesus your life is in my hands tell me something that'll cause me to release you i can kill you right now or i can set you free jesus said you have no power at all my father had to give it to you amen that's the truth praise the lord oh you know friend when you talk and think about how how that is that that that authority that power amen and the fact that he he himself not pilate have power over his life because jesus said i have authority over my life paraphrasing i'll lay it down i take it up again well people worry to death about all the things going on in this world today friend who has the power have you given and relinquished it to the devil or is that power in the truth do we believe that truth is that truth living in us is that true is that truth that we listen to and obey amen if it is then what are we worried about what are we scared over what are we fragging about there's nothing to be worried or scared frightened over amen god has it under control same god today proverbs i close here proverbs chapter 16 verse 25 proverbs samuel says there's two different places or uh um solomon says it's two different places this and his phrase exactly the same way i looked it up again the other day the wording is exactly the same in both places i just picked proverbs 16 25 there is the way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death yes there's a way that seemeth right to man man becoming the arbiter of truth and that man says well this is what's right what gives him the authority to say that the only way he could have an authority to say anything like that is if people gave it to him to listen to him and obey him same thing with the devil the only way you have power if you listen to it and you obey it yes if you obey it then you've accepted that person as the arbiter of truth and if you've accepted that person as the arbitrator of truth you've rejected christ christ the word has no effect then but there is a way that seems right to man it looks okay looks good seems right exactly the same wording two places solomon says this what a warning friend that it does seem right to man it looks like it might be right but the end of that is death god help us never to choose the way of a man yes never to choose or put somebody on a pedestal as being the arbiter of truth people do that to pastors you know yeah brother bannon warned against it fought against it yes they called him jesus christ and baptized his name and put him on this pedestal he fought it and fought it even had that vision about the snake it got beheaded but wiggled into the into the water well what's the water represents people multitudes people how did that snake get its power then from the people yeah brother branham rejected it flat out over and over and people still do it people come against this message because they think brother branham said that no he did not he was absolutely against it yes but it wiggled in that water and it got into a multitude of people again and that's where it gained its strength back because people continued to believe it they saw brother branham just like cain saw abel saw it and thought wow that's you know made a carnal interpretation of a spiritual revelation and they do the same thing today but he only brought a man a person can only bring what god has given to bring it is contained in this scripture any one of us we're not the arbiters of our own truth we are not disputed misinformation our ideas about what we think the bible says or what we think the message our quote might say no it is don't tell me what he said don't don't tell me what he meant tell me what he said don't tell me what the interpretation of it is what does it say because what it says is going to interpret itself right by bringing it past that becomes the truth because we recognize it and see it as the truth amen god help us that way that seems right to man and people think oh surely god will accept this surely god will be okay with this surely god i i'm a good person friend look this is not the time to be playing church now i don't know that that scarlet dress of that vice president was what brother branham saw i don't know beautiful woman evil heart i don't know i don't know if what's going on over there now with russian ukraine is a fulfillment of that vision that god gave brother branham those seven that unfold i don't know i do know that the exclamation behind it is watch for it see what's going on see what happens when this takes place and when this is going on do you know that there's like nine pipe energy pipelines coming out of russia into europe and seven i believe that seven of them go through ukraine seven because ukraine is the big bulk of land between russia and europe seven of those pipelines go through ukraine i'm not saying that's it i don't know but i know what's going to happen but i know when russia gets to that place that man maybe gets mad or accidentally or something pushes that button for him we're gone this bride's gone raptures happens amen how close are we brother ram said that in the 50s yes how much closer are we today yes oh my god help us it's not a time to be playing church it's not a time to be straddling fences and say well you know i i i'm a good person god will accept me you know hell's going to be full of good people yes with good intentions i don't say that lightly i don't say it easily it's hard for me to say because i don't want anybody to go there but the fact is there's going to be god just told me to accept that that that truth that arbiter that that that truth that is jesus christ the word amen that that word and continue to engulf in my life the truth will set you free friends yes amen truth will set you free maybe now the little message the the songs the lord give me about being set free the emancipator and god's setting us free but it's the truth that sets you free it's christ the truth the word is what sets us free amen woe unto that person that sees that word that knows that word like like like brother brandon said cain even satan knows the will of god and just flat refuses to do it you know i believe over in peter it says it's been better for that person never to have known the truth at all right but to have come to that truth and rejected it yes my it's a bad fearful time for humanity saints is about to hit this earth already started yeah pray for those in ukraine thanks brother danny for that pray for them there's believers there and again i i believe there's and brother green went to russia and found believers there i believe there's i believe there's still believers there amen there's a lot going on and what's going to happen in this country who knows well we know one thing it's going to be burnt border forward coast to coast destroyed we know what's going to happen but we'll be gone though praise the lord yes amen pray for them pray for those that are that need god amen we we all need him more and more every day yes amen let's stand if we could you know there was a man named jonah one time jonah didn't necessarily feel like he knew better he was just running from god he was just trying to get away from the truth he was trying to get away from the responsibility that was coming his way he uh he didn't know and he was he was trying to get away from it he was trying to run from it but as we probably have done before in our lives try to run from it god always has a way of bringing us back to where we should be he always has a way of of of causing us to come back to work uh to where he wants us in in his life yes amen and i believe he does it gently he did it to the jews amen call and and caused russia to rise up as one of them hitler and mussolini and stalin to to drive those jews back where they were supposed to be right bring those jews remember the great eagle on bringing back the prophets and the bringing them back on eagles wings you know all that was done for for that purpose nothing happens like this friend but what there's a purpose and there is a purpose amen there's a purpose i can't say that i am the arbiter of truth to know what that purpose necessarily is outside of what the scripture has said what brother branham or the prophecies has come amen i
