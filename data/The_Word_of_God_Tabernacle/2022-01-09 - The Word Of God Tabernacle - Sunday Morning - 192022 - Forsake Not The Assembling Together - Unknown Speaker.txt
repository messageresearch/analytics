came because there's something that draws us there's something in our heart that just can't wait those doors to open come and fellowship with those your brothers and sisters amen around the precious word of god worship and praise him oh has he been good to you this week amen you had a good week in the lord this week amen i got a miracle i want to give to you today amen joel's got a miracle he wants to give to you today i'm looking forward to what the lord's got in store for the rest of our service amen i'm believing he's here amen you believe that yes praise the lord amen i'm so thankful to be here god bless you we have a couple prayer requests we want to bring your attention today amen uh micah has a couple here he wants to mention um he said please keep me and remember um we're writing them down now so apologize got something on your heart we just keep it to the lord but are before the lord and we'll remember that in prayer god knows anyway but if you want to have the prayer requests read up here we're going to write them down now we're going to write them down if you do it here we have other pads you can take them on your own paper whatever just keep reminding us of that so that we don't let it slip but i'm only going to have reading the prayer requests and the praise reports as they're given to me so micah wrote these down said please keep me in your prayers as i am at the tail end of preparing for the state insurance exam i plan to schedule to take it this week thank you brother micah so i remember that amen he took a practice test this week and passed so i don't believe that this is going to be any different amen in fact the only difference it'll be is that his score will be higher amen but if it's like real estate when you pass your pass if you pass by one tenth of the point you passed if you fail by a tenth of a point you fail that's all they care about if you pass you pass you move on so but i believe i believe he's already he's gonna pass so but uh please remember him in prayer if you would you also uh last week you remember he put a prayer request for his friend uh he uh put it again here please continue to remember the lady i mentioned last week who at 42 is expected by medical standards to die from the flu her name is amy and she is still alive i ask that if it's god's will she'd be made whole so i could use this as a witness and testimony to my friends amen so prairie requested that micah has on his heart if we can remember those we also had a we want to continue to remember brother charlie and sister teresa in our prayers the last report i got from sister teresa last night is she is feeling a lot better she said the doctors called her yesterday and said that pneumonia looks worse but she's feeling better so that's the main thing to me doctors can only read what they can read instruments can only say what they can say but we know by faith in god's word that he has already healed amen she's doing much better um he prescribed more meds but she's feeling much better today this was yesterday or last night she said charlie is uh has not really improved he does say he is ready to meet the lord he also is grateful that so many people are praying for him he's also uh what the doctors have said but i'm thankful that we hold brother charlie up in prayer that he's going to come out of that hospital yes that's my profession that's my confession brother charlie satello is going to come out of that hospital he's going to sit right back there again in this congregation and have church with us amen he has progressed he's come along uh at one point they had him on 100 almost 100 oxygen and he was still not able to breathe and saturate the oxygen but as the weak went along the oxygen level dropped even down to 70 percent the nurses dropped his oxygen to 70 percent he started breathing on his own and his oxygen levels were staying good he he's no longer sedated to the point that he even called his brother yesterday if you're friends with david sotelo uh he put out a facebook that charlie called him and said to have people pray for him that not knowing that we maybe not knowing that we already have been intimately affectionately fervently praying for brother charlie amen and believing that god is i already see the improvement god's already it's already moving god's already healed him i believe that amen also sister sheila said uh yesterday that she is feeling a little better this was again yesterday uh still coughing a lot amen so please remember her in prayer you know how that coffin you know in your chest and your throat and all it's it's really difficult so please remember to continue to remember to pray for sister sheila also of course one prayer request that came up yesterday that most of you know about i sent it out brother angel right before church sent me an update about priscilla and he said they're still waiting on a hospital there at northwest urgent care still waiting on a hospital bed uh giving her antibiotics and pain meds but nothing has changed she's still bleeding internally and there's no improvement on the holes in here intestines yet we are waiting for bed to open so they'll transfer her immediately they've done all they can do for her where she's at so she really needs a bed to open up to get in uh for the physicians and all to really see her so he said please continue to pray for her she's in a lot of pain uh was up with her until a 9 a.m this morning and she just fell asleep he said uh he texted me at ten she had just fallen asleep at nine um and they're still praying that a bed comes open uh quickly so please remember her in prayer their surgery is a last resort because the surgery comes with some very high risks the doctors are very concerned that the what they call cocktail of sedation medicine they have to give her could kill her uh so please they're not sure her heart would be able to take it so please remember her in prayer so surgery is a very last option prayer is the first option best option and the most important option so we continue to hold sister priscilla and the family in prayer uh god would move upon and touch and heal her and raise her up out of that bed amen so we got some very serious illness amen that's going on in our family here but by god's grace and through his healing virtues they are well in jesus name amen amen praise the lord you have an unspoken request on your heart yes amen the lord knows all our hearts today amen the lord will bless you let's stand to our feet if we could and take these news to the lord today in prayer brother dennis would you pray for him lord jesus we come before you in humbleness of heart yes knowing there are some serious needs amongst your family and father we need to take these things to heart lord we know that you're putting your true bride in the position that she needs to pray more knowing that true love is caring one for another yes and putting ourselves last and putting you first and others uh uh next and our and father may you just put that uh fervency in our hearts more than ever to pray to call in your name amen there are yes precious loved ones that need a touch they even need a miracle that we serve a miracle working god hallelujah it's still the same yesterday today and forever yes you are not relaxed you're not taking a vacation you're not far away you're very present help in a time of need and help us to recognize that lord help us to live a victorious life we all sin and come short of your glory but there's power in the blood of jesus christ as we repent and make things right we can't count before your throne in boldness knowing this we bring our petitions known to you that you'll hear us you'll give us the desires of our heart brother charlie i believe needs a miracle but as our pastor said we're going to stand on your word that he'll be back in fellowship jesus he'll have a testimony yes they'll accept this church on fire that set the believers on fire and lord all the other serious requests this lady friend oh brother michael lord that she needs a miracle it not even herself but we believe for her we just believe that above all if she doesn't know you of lord and savior of her life that she will give her heart to you and that you'll heal her completely known you already paid the price in full at calvary and father our brother is going through a test it seems like it's real involved and lord there was a testimony already that he took a pre-test and he did well laurence he takes the test this week may it come forth with flying colors that you'll get the testimony you'll get the glory for all that we do it's not of ourselves we are failures empty us of ourselves may we die daily by anything good that you can use in our lives it's you that gets the glory father and help us to learn to lean on thee god who is rich in mercy your love is still with us your presence will always be with us to the very end may we be more caring loving and concerned about one another lord bless each one has made an effort to be here but bless their hearts as they raise their hand you know what they have need of random other desires of their heart may their cup runneth over may there be joy unspeakable and full of glory let that may the testimonies come forth that truly father it's your life in america this is the victory yes granted lord bless our pastor as he brings forth your word bless our hearts to open up to receive your word in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord praise the lord thank you lord amen you can be seated if you like amen i want to sing this song we don't really sing very often it's a little bit lengthy but amen they come number three in the songbook actually amen it's on the board on the screens too though for you if you want but number three in the song book come from the east and west lands afar they come praise the lord let's sing it to him now they come from the east and west they come from the lands [Music] face a glow with light divine bless partakers of his grace as gems in his shine since jesus has set me free i'm happy as lord can be no longer i bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as not but darkness has taken flight now i shout the victory for jesus has set me free [Music] [Music] no sorrow is no nor death in that goodly land my savior has gone before preparing the way for me sir [Music] stand open by night and day all the to the lord who giveth more grace whose love has prepared the way [Music] [Music] now oh jesus is coming soon our trials will then lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin [Music] [Music] when our lord and glory comes we'll meet him up in the end since jesus has set me free [Music] i'm happy as heart can be no longer i bear the burden of care is your soul sweet to me my soul was as black as nine but darkness has taken flight now i shout the victory for jesus [Music] hallelujah amen praise the lord they come from all over don't they yes we came from all over amen we're pretty much a representative of tucson the far east side southeast side west side northwest side southwest side amen i'm looking at the entirety of tucson here amen praise the lord amen because god's blessed us the center of tucson sister matisse lives right down here close to downtown now pretty close anybody amen we got it covered praise the lord you came from all over to come and be here today because you know why you didn't expect to come for me you didn't come for one another you came because you knew he would be here yes amen to meet with him praise the lord that's the number one thing praise the lord jesus amen micah gave me a little exhortation yesterday when he started to write this song down and i don't know if he wanted to give it or you want me to read it oh you can read it i'll read it then sometimes it's good for the person whom the thought came from to exhort uh themselves but as he was writing this song uh putting it in the computer to have projected up here we get to this last verse um best partakers of history as gems and his crown just shine you know micah's kind of a gemologist a little bit it's not officially but kind of likes gems and those things and when he was typing that i'll just write what he texts me um jim's in his crown of shine he said this came to me in gemology the brilliance of a gem now think of that the gem is you amen that jim is us that gemini's crown is us that gem is classified by what's called a reflective index the reflective index is a measurement of how the velocity of light which is him changes when light passes through a mineral or the gym you get it as that light passes through us the gem the mineral a high reflective index is linked to the dispersion of the light into the mineral which gives minerals such as diamonds their fire that's why they shine so brilliantly and that's why so many people like them so much to be a gem in his crown we need to be clean and pure so when his light hits us we reflect the brilliance that he is if we let our lives get muddled uh uh when his light hits us it's not going to shine reflect as brilliantly uh as it would to others yes amen you know i thought that was worth mentioning amen i did i wish he had done it i thought that was worth mentioning amen i agree with that that's so very true praise the lord isn't it joel i heard joel has a testimony do you want to come up here and tell it are you okay right there i think you could come up no you've come up in the same force before you sure uh on friday okay hold on hold on just a minute if you're not going to come up hold on a minute i want to make sure everybody hears you okay so friday night uh after the party i when uh my dad was cleaning up the wheels of my walker i just felt to walk and then i just started walking and now i can walk without a walk and i know that god would just kill us every ass amen praise the lord amen thank you lord amen do you all get that yes amen his dad went to clean off because he was at the birthday party for mariah friday night uh there peter piper and he's come and he's he's putting pressure on his foot but he's still got his walker and they take it home and he goes to clean i guess often joe's like i feel like i can walk that right i believe i could he walked into church amen praise the lord thank god for that amen so appreciate the lord's goodness amen praise the lord i was so good to him you know that infection could have got so bad he could have lost his ankle his foot his leg amen but god was merciful so thankful to that you know so many times people look at things and they think oh that is so horrible how could god have allowed that and i was on the job tuesday i gave this testimony a little bit on the if you if you saw the recording i put out wednesday night by the way it's still open to the public on our website but micah's going to make that into the congregation only part of our website so if you haven't seen it you want to and not have to get into that part of the website you go ahead and watch it but it is still available to the public uh wednesday night but i gave a little bit of it but tuesday we were in hereford me and brother roger was in here for doing a mini split on a house and we had to run some pipe around the house and uh it was in concrete so we take a hammer drill that's corded a lot of times because it drills into the concrete a lot easier killing yourself to put a hole so you can drill some concrete bolts or screws into to hold the pipe on the wall and we had done one side of the house we were going around the front of the house and so it was a corded drill so i brought the drill around and it got hung on the drop cord got hung in a little twig if it had been something significant i'd have walked over and you know lifted it up and it was just a little trick so you know how many times in my life i've done this with a drop cord and you and you pull on it to whip it up to get it over that thing to bring it to you well when i pulled to whip it it came loose now this is a 250 dollar hammer drill and the plug on it is about that big and that big around very thick very hard plastic and when i went to whip it and pull it it came loose and it came and hit me right there you see the spots uh there on my nose and on my forehead where that plug came and hit me right there it happened so fast i didn't even see it when i pulled i just felt a bam on my head didn't even see it and i thought what was that took me a second to figure out what had happened and i came to myself and i started to go back to work and blood just started pouring out on the ground like oh something's wrong here but once i and and i went to the van and cleaned it off and put a bandage on it so i didn't bleed all over everybody's stuff and you know it's been fine i kind of felt woozy when i was in the van because it hit me it hit me really hard right here uh as you can see i don't know how it did this did not even touch my glasses didn't even move them i didn't even have to adjust my glasses it hit so perfectly now that sounds odd considering what it did to me but it hit so perfect god those angels surrounding it guided that thing to hit so perfectly on my face that it didn't even disturb my glasses must last break and i went home and told my wife she said see that's why you pray i said i said i did that's why it didn't go here or here and as i started thinking i thought one inch either way and that thing would have put my eye out it hit that hard it would have shoved the glass right into my eyeball i mean it could have been very very disastrous uh if it broke my glasses i'd have been without my i couldn't have seen to finish the job i had to drive home from benson um god was just so merciful amen and people looked at that well my if you just shouldn't happen well things do happen things they do happen but if we're prayed up and we're trusting the lord he makes everything work together for our good and it just it just happened again that it hit so perfectly that it i just i bled a lot but other than that it it i i put a bandage on it and we kept working and finished to finish the job uh drove home and took a shower you know praise the lord that i thought i thought so much what a miracle it was yes i'm so thankful that god he one one is either way and it could have been a whole different story saints and i'm so thankful that god is merciful to us praise the lord so that's my testimony today i thank the lord he watches over us yes amen i and oddly enough i already had what i spoke on wednesday i already had on my heart to bring so this didn't have anything to do with what i was saying with him always being there that didn't have anything to do with this if i had already had that so it just it was just god god orchestrates it also he knows exactly how to do it where to do it and amen thank the lord he's good amen praise the lord just i don't know how people can't serve the lord jesus he's so good to us amen micah had a song you wanted to sing for so amen lord bless him uh there's been a lot of talk about the rapture and stuff in the last couple of weeks to be in the new year uh stubborn losing our enthusiasm for the coming of the lord yes hallelujah i can almost hear the trumpet amen [Music] his hallelujah the dead in christ shall rise [Music] those that remains [Music] jesus we're is everywhere cause at the midnight ride [Music] the bride of christ amen when jesus steps out hallelujah [Music] yes [Music] and when jesus steps [Music] our [Music] eyes that we make [Music] jesus [Music] amen hallelujah thank you jesus praise the lord amen thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise the lord isn't that what we're living for yes looking forward to that time amen i believe it's soon and very soon amen we're going to see the king praise the lord jesus amen thank you for that micah let's stand to our feet if we could go to the word of god now amen may have noticed um thankful we uh craig fixed the heat for us i mean i had the heaters around i didn't i didn't even i never even forgot to mention to him that the heat wasn't working but i came in yesterday after our brother's breakfast and came in and pray in what i do in here on most of the day on saturdays and he had a note sticking on the thermostat it said the heat's working and so praise the lord i just i don't know how i just fought to check but checked and so now it's working so thank the lord for that makes it a little easier on me anyway not that you're necessarily uncomfortable but i had to come in and plug in two or three heaters and position them around so it was nice just to come push a button and there it was amen so i appreciate him doing that yes i mean he's supposed to do that as a landlord but sometimes that doesn't always work out that way so i appreciate him doing that amen now if you turn your bibles with me in hebrews i'm going to go to hebrews chapter 10 reading beginning with verse 22. hebrews chapter 10. i'm going to begin reading with verse 22 hebrews 10 22. amen before i read it though this again bow our heads forward good lord jesus we're certainly grateful to again today lord for you're bringing us together again lord we're missing a few and certainly we do miss them we love them so much father and there's those that are seeking body needed today those who aren't able to make it we're just trusting and praying that your hand of mercy would be upon them bless them be with them heal them strengthen them lord bring them in once again father at your hand would be upon them and touch them lord we thank you god for those that were able to come those that are here today put forth the effort lord to be in the house of god may you bless them exceedingly bless every one of us father for a great needy people needing of you lord expecting you again to move in a mighty powerful supernatural way in our presence once again in this assembly in this congregation in this building this place has been consecrated lord for you we thank you lord for coming and being here and visiting with us for the song service and just trusting you now to speak through these lips what you have to be heard hear through the ears of each one of us lord what should have to be heard and may that word come and reveal itself to all hearts that we would live what you would have for us to live and encourage and strengthen and bless and correct and whatever purpose you send this word forth for today we trust that it would be accomplished lord i pray god thanking you for all that you do for us every day the miracles the the the this the fact just the sheer fact that we know that you are always with us yes lord gives us such a peace yes thank you for it lord bless us now god as we go into your word speak to us from it lord we pray in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen hebrews 10 verse 22 it says let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience in our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another in so much more and so much the more as you see the day approaching for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for the judgment of and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries you can be seated if you like i don't want to take a thought of that that just kind of struck me here a few weeks ago that i believe the lord put on my heart and took me to this scripture and that is the 25th verse 25th verse which we have quoted many times which we say to one another many times which we use for the purpose of of of our assembling together one one thing that we use scripture wise of our assembling together for it says that we are not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but even that much more as we see that day approaching so that that came to me very strong with the things that's going on in the world today with what's happening around the world today now i want you to notice it it seems that that is a great influence and and what's happening and recognizing what the scripture says about it uh is significant to me uh but when you look at that and you see what's going on today and as the lord began to unfold this to me yesterday uh me and sonia had something to do yesterday afternoon she kept texting me says well when are you going to be done i'm like i don't know when i come here on saturday saints i don't know when i'm going to be leaving right however long it takes the lord to unfold this and bring this to me for today is how i'm going to be here that that's all i know so that's what i do and that's what i told him but as the lord began to unfold it things became so prevalent my mind and heart i started thinking it's amazing uh what is happening and and sometimes the devices that that the enemy uses that's contrary to the scripture uh and we've got to be aware of those things we got to be cognizant we need to have our spiritual understanding our spiritual acuity on high alert with what's going on because the devil lulls us so many times into accepting a lower part of what the scripture is trying to help us to do to understand to do one of those things is the assembling of ourselves together amen assembling together now i want you to see something here and i don't mean this in a wrong way so i'll probably have to expound it a little bit but it doesn't say church it doesn't right i just read it and i quoted it you want to read it again it says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching did you hear the word church it does not say church but now that being said church that we have here a building of his house a place to come a designated place designated time designated purpose is always probably first and foremost paramount to our gathering together so i'm not negating the church part but it's also important that we gather together with those of like precious faith even if it's not church you think about the the word assembling the word assembling simply means gathering in one place amen like the sisters do when they go and have a lunch together it's good i i can't tell you how good that does my heart when i know the sisters are getting together to have a lunch and have fellowship and come together as one unit as one entity as one group as a representation of this congregation right uh and having a meal together it's it's it's following the scripture it's assembling together it's gathering in one place yes we had the breakfast uh the brother's breakfast sunday morning uh i hate that several of you weren't able to make it but uh me and brother dennis and brother danny had a good time yes yesterday morning but that that is a gathering together it is coming together it is a fulfilling this scripture really because we the three of us at least assembled together like precious faith amen it matters when we have our dinners together i really enjoy our dinners and and this is probably the most important reason not the food not the uh not having to go to a restaurant or whatever just just the gathering together part just being together all of us together as much as can come anyway together and be together and enjoy one another's company enjoy one another's fellowship and fellowship together and get to know one another and get closer together become a closer knit uh group and and that's a big part of it because that's that's the way this body is supposed to be that's the way this bride is supposed to be uh and things on top of that harmony's coming up this week you know i i don't know how much we'll be able to make it but i want to try to go to at least one but that that is another uh a fulfillment of this scripture of assembling together of those of like precious faith people coming together amen but the assembling together that that we have that we talk about here uh that that is a part of our church now there's obviously other assemblings that you can do uh we we have a gathering together of a bride internationally very much right we're not only the same building we're not the same state we're not the same country we're spread all over the world but we're assembled together we're assembled together under the same auspice of the shed blood of jesus christ we share commonality we share a same language we share a same desire and the same uh holy spirit and all those things in that comment that's that is that is a one place that one place is jesus christ so i understand that there are the gatherings together uh we have the streaming uh that people can gather together like that but there's and i understand that but there's nothing that can take the place of me looking in your eye and you're looking in my eye and us standing arm and arm face to face hand in hand fighting this good fight of faith there's not a substitute to it this country especially i imagine probably the world but this country has become since i was even born has become more and more urbanized as as time continues on people are coming closer together and getting closer uh in proximity with one another when i was growing up i couldn't imagine how houses that you see sometimes when you go around you could actually stick your arm out one window and the other person stick your arm out their other window and shake hands they're so the houses are so close together they could literally stand in their house and shake hands with one another and stick your hands out the window that's how close it is but people have never been more apart than in this day right they're coming closer together they're urbanizing more but they're but they're drawing further apart than they ever were used to be a time where um you'd go down the street or have neighbors you knew your neighbors you knew and it wasn't a snooping it wasn't anything like that it's just that you loved each other you appreciated them as a neighbor you're in a good neighborhood with good people and you loved one another you needed an egg a cake you went next door get an egg if they didn't have one you go to the next one cup of sugar whatever it was gallon of milk they would give it to you too right you see that today very rare i'm sure it probably does still happen to some degree but it's very rare of course it used to be back then where uh you didn't have a store every half a mile that if you could just hop the car go to the store a half a mile and you've got an egg you used to be you get in your car if you lived in a certain area a certain place like we used to you could you'd have to drive miles just to try to get some sugar or egg or something right so it was a little different but people used to know one another they used to fellowship they used to be a camaraderie there used to be a neighborhood they were neighbors and and in some degree it's kind of like that i know brother pat knows his neighbors i know brother pat's neighbor but by and far we've come closer together and drawn farther apart and that's exactly so that's identifying the world spirit and understanding that we ourselves are supposed to avoid that spirit as best as possible why because it's contrary to the scripture if it's contrary to the scripture you know it's not god so what is god just the opposite which is what the word says so if there's a spirit that's becoming prevalent in the world and we see this contrary to the scripture then we need to get away from that spirit and guard ourselves from it and one of those things is to be able to understand how important it is of the assembling of ourselves together of each one of us coming in one place at the same time arm and arm hand in hand together as brother and sister fighting this good fight it's important if you don't think it's important saints why is satan fight it so hard right yes he fights it so hard and he's making it more more convenient amen and and i i don't mind saying i have contemplated stopping the streaming yes but i'm not but it it becomes a convenience and it shouldn't become a convenience it shouldn't become an excuse it shouldn't be come to the place well we can instead of driving 15 miles to church we can sit here and just watch it no if it gets to that place it's gone yes right as far as me and the pastor of this church if he gets to that place in our lives and i'm not saying it has don't believe it has but i'm saying if it does it's gone right now streaming's over that's how i feel about it because i truly believe that that gathering together like we're doing right now is very important but it's very important at this point that there are people like the frajos like sister sheila and those and and others who tune in maybe that don't live here that want to see it and want to be a part of it and and and it'll stay there as a result but it can't be a substitute right kova can't scare people's and see copenhagen's been one of those things too what has coveted done covet has drawn people apart even more than they were before separated people apart even more than they were before dividing people even more than they were before yes arguing fussy complaining worried scared fear more than they were before people was it one of our stories yesterday maybe brother dennis brother danny i can't remember but somebody told me recently they went somewhere and and and this lady she had on well anyway she's living in a bubble and good for her that's fine i'm not i'm not i'm not criticizing her because if that's your faith level that's fine if that's your faith level then that's what you do that's that's that's okay i'm not complaining i'm not criticizing her for it but but you come in her presence and if i get the story right and i'm not can't remember if it was told yesterday and she's like no stop stop don't come near me i mean that that's the whole spirit of it and and that's a part of the result of what's happening with that demonic devil that spirit that's infiltrating in the people of our country that's dividing and ripping it apart even more just like it's trying to infiltrate or tries its best to infiltrate in the churches in the local assemblies and don't let it see because it's not supposed to be that way we're supposed to gather together with those of like precious faith satan loves to keep us divided right you know that satan will do anything he can to keep us apart right a roaring fire is a beautiful thing but if you take a coal out of that fire and set it over here that fire just blaze on but that coal will go dead in no time right because it's separated out yes and i'm sorry but streaming's not a substitute for that you've got to be in that fire yes you've got to be in that fire amen i'll leave it right there let's go to another matthew chapter 18. another scripture matthew 18 19. their strength friends their strength that comes from being together we draw strength from one another that's why there's just the scriptural reference of laying hands on one another actually physically putting your hand on somebody it makes a difference yes amen um have you had any problems since the last time we lay hands on you sister try you look like that no when you passed out in the parking lot oh no no there's power that comes from laying hands on each other there's power not that not that god doesn't hear our prayers right i mean i would have loved and i asked sister teresa and she said no nobody's allowed to go see charlie because i was going to go i said i just want to go put my hand on him right but but even at that god god is touched by the feeling of our infirmities so he hears our prayers when we're not able to but there's strength to that yes there there's such a strength and well you ever heard the phrase strengthen numbers yeah right strength in numbers we bind together this shows us this this shows a a force a strength satan sees that satan sees you why do you think especially parents with children why because i say that because it happened to us why do you think that sunday mornings are always the worst mornings great yes everything can snap together during the week and the mornings can go fine and you can get them to school or whatever you got to do and everything plays along but when it comes sunday morning everything falls apart can't find the right clothes can't do this something that gets on the kid and that they don't want to get dressed or whatever it is something is nothing goes right on sunday morning not because that happened to us i know and we had to drive an hour to church so we know it's not easy it is a battle but the the worst of the battles on sunday morning why why do you think it's like that because satan does everything first of all to tear your spirit up right now he wants to keep you from coming but if you do press on and you do come he wants your spirit so tore up that you don't get anything when you're here to disrupt the flow of the holy spirit that's in here by your spirit that got so tore off that you're unable to receive what god wants to give to you amen first of all he wants to keep you from coming period because he doesn't want you here because he knows their strength when we come together he knows that he knows we draw strength from coming here and being here together he knows that that's why he fights it so hard praise the lord so if it's like that we need to press further that much more to make sure we come against that spirit and obey the word and assemble ourselves together amen amen there's strength to that saints amen that's why he fights so hard that's why you see things happening the way you see it in the world it's a spirit it's a prevailing spirit matthew chapter 18 had you turned there verse 19. matthew 18. let's see order don't want to start here matthew 18 19. again i say unto you that if two of you agree together uh shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven how many two now god that doesn't mean that god doesn't hear each individual's prayer that's not what he's saying but he's talking about how this how there is strength in numbers yeah right if one can face uh can chase a thousand two can chase ten thousand tell me there's not strength in numbers that is math that does not add up am i correct right if one can chase a thousand then two should chase 2 000 so how does 2 chase 10 000 right it's sort of like compound interest i guess amen it just rolls itself over 1 000 to 10 000 what would three do if they were together just three well he said the scripture says here that if any two come together touching anything agreeing on anything praise the lord well how many of us here this morning are agreeing together for brother charlie and sister priscilla and sister sheila and the sickness and the thing the prayer requests for micah and the different things that's been on your hearts and your unspoken if we all hear believing that and holding that before the lord how many devils can we chase out right praise the lord one thousand two ten thousand according to god that this those devils don't have a chance against us right none amen because that's the word two if you agree on earth is touching anything that ye that they ask it shall be done for them by my father which is in heaven praise the lord yes so that settles it for where two or three two or three are gathered together in my name there i in there am i in the midst of them yes now the biggest problem most people and you've probably heard me pray this several times but the biggest problem a lot of people have with this scripture is they don't gather in the name of jesus christ they come together in the name of a church or denomination or a pastor or some kind of nicolaitanism or some kind of worldlyism or whatever it is or or legalism they gather together under some other different kind of auspice than than the name of jesus christ and if it's in any other capacity in any other name it will not work it only works where two or three are gathered in his name that's when it works that's why we're here and we're here in his name in his name only not wigan brown no sir no sir we're here in the name of the lord jesus christ praise god that's when things begin to move yes because he's here because he promised he would be here yeah a lot of people think that big churches and huge congregations is a sign of god's blessings well if that's true the catholic church is the most blessed group on earth because they got the biggest prettiest buildings they got the largest groups they got the most members that there are of any group in the uni in the world under those criteria they're the blessed now the bible says where two or three are gathered right jesus said fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen praise the lord when they were in the upper room 120 of them he chose 12 disciples always little numbers not this is not that there's anything wrong with a larger church i don't mean that at all but you can't measure the success or the blessings of god based on a building or the number of people amen brother branham talked about one man standing on the street corner eating soda cracker drinking branch water winning souls to god amen which is more important right a witch is more blessed yes amen john the baptist has come climbing out of the wilderness with locust and honey calming off his beard it looked like a wild man but he had something from god right who was more blessed the pharisees and sadducees who went up into their hollow halls of their kingdoms and their palaces and stuff and come out and and declare proclamation on john the baptist that you are wrong man and you are going to hell you were of the devil it did the same thing with jesus call him the eldest book right you're a man calling yourself god no he was god condescending into man but they failed to see it which one was more blessed they crucified him and hung them up on a cross cursed it it's him that hangs on on a tree right but which one was more blessed amen the one that was hanging there or the ones that did it amen you got we've got to watch what that that measurement where do we meet that measurement thing amen now that coming together see where two or three are gathered in my name that's the key in his name so we come together in his name that's the reason we're here we come together in his name let's go over to ecclesiastes chapter 4. amen dear three are gathered in my name what uh what a beautiful thing it is that god gave us saints and made it to where we can do it and thank the lord we still live in a country where we're not threatened of persecution and imprisonment or death even for doing it yes yes praise god god give us nice vehicles god's provided for us for gas or whatever it is or transportation somehow god allows us to be able to get here yes amen thank god for it so under those criteria basically we are without excuse yes great amen god help us but it gives us strength and you know i believe you know what i'm talking about i'm not trying to tell you anything new i'm just trying to encourage us in the fact that we can guard ourselves against those spirits and try to get us laxadaisical and try to keep us away from the house of god right that's right and then try to keep us away from assembling together try to keep us away from being together with our brothers and sisters amen those of like precious faith fellowshipping loving one another spending time together you might not agree with everything they say amen in their fellowship but that's not the point the point is that in the spirit of god we're drawing that strength together from one another for the purpose of serving the lord amen ecclesiastes chapter four verse nine two are better than one now that's the bible you hear that in the world a lot of times but it's actually scriptural two are better than one amen praise the lord i have that philosophy when i talk about candy bars or steaks two is better than one absolutely but scripturally it accounts to us to understand that two together is better than just one the one coal goes out very fast listen to listen to uh his his uh reasoning two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow amen amen but woe to him that is alone when he fallen and friend we do fall yes every one of us we have very possibly will again right fall not backslide but just just fall in a place that we really need that encouragement and then like the eagle and the the eagle gets in this moping stage when it gets in its moping stage those other eagles come around and they they fly over that eagle and in smoking stage and they drop him down some food say here eat that it'll do you good it'll strengthen you if that eagle set there in that moping stage he alone he just dies right he'll just die but he's got some other eagle buddies that come and they get some flesh for them and they fly around and they drop it to them and they encourage them and they eat that and you'll give you strength and encouragement and get you into the heavens again see that's what we need that's what one of us what we do for one another and i don't know how many times that in the years of this congregation i know of particularly other places i have too but uh here i'll just say because it's us as this congregation has happened over and over again with the encouragement sometimes it's through calls or texts or something but there's nothing like being together right nothing like being here it seems like people getting listen to this circus it seems like people get into despair and then they and and so they don't come to church because they're in despair when the fact of the matter is by not coming to church makes your despair worse it's cyclical the despair will make a person not want to come to church but not coming to church will keep you in despair that's right amen that's that's how it works if you're in despair being here with those of like precious faith and your brothers and sisters and encouraging is the best medicine you can have it's the best encouragement you can get amen but if you sit at home and you stay at home that that that coal just sits there doing all it can to stay kindled it'll just get more despair more in despair if you get despair you come come to church yes i hate to use it as an example but you know when our first son passed away um we were in quite a despair right quite a despair and i i i will exhort my wife in this she missed one service she went to a c-section had a a child that passed a day and a half later and she only missed one church service there was no streaming then this is 32 years ago there was no streaming then amen one service and i just exhort her for that because and i know you have your stories but i can tell you that she sat there and she probably got absolutely nothing out of the service outside of the fact that she was there she cried the entire time that's all she could do probably did a little myself but she cried the whole time but just being there and being in that presence and being with those people and feeling that spirit and that encouragement step at a time it got better better better i will say it got easier but it got better each time to help lift out of that despair see one good strong eagle you drop a morsel of meat down to the the moping the eagle that's in moping stage that one that's all nice but he needs more than that when they're that down in that despair it takes more than the one and that's what the scripture is trying to exhort us to understand that helps us more than anything you understand i have people who say well i'm depressed this the best place to be if you feel discouraged this is the best place to be right amen praise the lord two are better than one because they have a good reward if one fault lift up his fellow woe to him that is alone when he falls for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warmer alone and if what prevail against him two shall withstand him amen strengthen numbers praise the lord strengthen numbers and a threefold chord is not quickly broken or two or three if one can chase a thousand to ten thousand what can three do and a three-fold chord is just it's just a chord that's that's intertwined with each other it's not like three growths that are just together like but they're intertwined threefold is they're intertwined together they're all wrapped together like electrical wire they're all wrapped together they make one chord because they're all together that's what threefold is they're all that's the way they were in the upper room it went one night and one accord 120 up one minute and one accord i tell you that was quite an accomplishment friend for 120 to be on one mind at one accord i don't i that would be a challenge today yes to get 120 to be in one minute and one accord but that three-fold court is not quickly broken two's chasing ten thousand having these three chasing i mean it's not common mass you can't even really figure it out but but when that three-fold chord is together and make up one chord together friend that's that that is a formidable foe that satan cannot defeat he'll he won't leave you alone he'll keep coming against you but he can't defeat it and i more than almost anything like to see that in this church right with us that not three but however many we have 30 that if everybody comes that are all intertwined together make one chord amen not not not a word of god tabernacle quarter jesus chord amen not a mutant being a chord not a way your brain above right jesus accord for jesus that's that's what we're to be yeah amen not because it's this church because i believe we should be that way for all believers around the world that's how we're going that's how we should exist here that's how we're all going to go together we're all going to go together we're looking for a rapture all the believers around the world the alive and remain group well the dead that have gone on we're all going to go together right as one yes all together so that togetherness that love is so important it's the love that bonds amen it's a three-fold chord that's wrapped around love is what's holding it together the love of the word a threefold court see is not quickly broken and we know that if they come together that that three together oh my better is a poorer let's let's move on from that amen let's go over to acts chapter 2. another scripture here i want to close amen praise the lord i believe that's why david wrote in the psalmist that he inhabits the praises of his people he inhabits the inhabitants the praises of israel which is his people which we are his people he inhabits the praises we come in here and we worship and we praise him that that that brings the manifestation of his spirit real to us and then we feel the moving of that spirit in us amen not not that that spirit takes flight but it moves in and and becomes a part of us that's when faith begins to reverberate in you and when that faith reverberates then there's nothing impossible to god's children nothing then we take hold of of something in agreement god is bound to do it yes but that takes us together all of us together praying together the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much yes the verb effectual fervent prayer of righteous people avail of how much more than just much right praise before the throne of god acts uh acts chapter 2 verse 42. look what they did in the book of acts now just after they received the holy ghost they've all been born again now received the holy ghost and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship in the breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common praise the lord sold their possessions goods part of them to all men as every man had need they continued daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and giving favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved how did they do it together as a church as a group as an assembly how do we do it exact same way as a church as a group as an assembly we come together and being together causes that causes that faith that strength that that we need that boost that we need to continue to press on amen it it's it's what makes the difference that three-fold chord amen that that roaring fire together we make a difference psalms we'll go to psalms i read one more scripture i want to read a quote to you and then we'll close psalms chapter 107. praise the lord psalms 107 verse 1 oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever the redeemed of the lord say so i just said it amen whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gather them out of the lands from the east from the west from the north from the south here we are sitting here this morning remember when brother brown went i believe it was to the seals was it the seals he said look we got them from all over or no no i believe it was future home it was a future home message stopped he said look here look at how we got people from from this direction and then from that direction and then from this direction and then from that direction see i get that was why i guess the lord inspired me to put that they come yeah the east and west north south lands afar i labeled it here just in the few people we've got here pretty much every single part of this city represented right here you come in to this central location praise the lord amen right north south east west north south they wandered in the wilderness in a solidarity way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they cried unto the lord in their trouble notice how it's it's together in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses and he led them forth by the right way and that they might go to a city of habitation all that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful words to the children of men praise the lord why do you think god had instructed moses the original tabernacle in the wilderness why would god want moses to build that place if he didn't desire for them to come together in one place notice the children of israel that they were they were in a a central locale they were all there camping together in the wilderness but god still had moses build a sanctuary he still helped him build a place where god could come down into the holy place into the holies of holies and that the people could come in and they could gather and they could worship god put other uh uh people in charge and and set ministers and a priesthood in there to minister to the people so that they would come together to draw the strength not just from the word not even just from god's presence in that holy place but from one another why did god do that if there was if it wasn't a purpose and a strength to it we have a representation of that here today the only difference is that his holy place is us this is his house this is the place that we prayed over and is dedicated and consecrated to him service to him there's not going to be any bingo games and all mess in here we're never going to have suppers that that take up this sanctuary this is god's house this is a place of holiness and reverence yes the holy spirit is very timid yes very timid yes the slightest out of out of the way and that spirit moves away from them from you right amen that's why we do everything with reverence and holiness that's why even michael put up here in respecting the sanctuary after we've after we've dismissed right we got a place of fellowship we live in tucson friend we're hardly ever reigns and weather is usually beautiful even to step outside in fellowship and spend time together i love that i i i it just it does my heart good to see people that are together and fellowshipping and talking and enjoying one another's company and drawing strength from one another amen i know just what he did for me this week the miracle in my life and and what he did for joel the testimonies the testimonies that we have yeah they make such a difference to us yes amen they we draw strength from those encouragement it helps us amen praise the lord so god's given us this place and it's for that purpose yes and we need to keep it that way right and continue to this gathering together amen it's gathering together some of us go to jobs every day some of us um go to doctors or go shopping or there's there's all kinds of people all over wherever you go there's people there's people all over the place but there's nothing like coming into the place like this or calling a brother's breakfast or a sister's lunch or a church dinner or something and then you just come and it's kind of it's kind of like you come into that little bubble right we had a little well not a little but we had a like a six-person booth at denny's right here yesterday well yesterday in the morning and it was like we were just sealed off we were just we were away from the world all people people everywhere right but when the presence of god dropped in in our conversation and all that was there yes nobody else knew anything about all that it was just us in the lord it's beautiful yeah amen i personally draw great strength amen great strength from that and i i as i know you do maybe the lunches are the dinners we have here but it's all a part of it yes assembling ourselves together this is the centerpiece the our church times our church services is the centerpiece of that but off of that we have our other times we spend time together amen i'm so glad i'm so thankful i hear so many times people uh they go visit family and and their family and they love them but they're like i'm so glad to get away from there because they're not believers and and i say that sarcastically i guess but uh you know i've heard people say those type things because it's hard to be around and i'm so thankful my family we all we serve the lord very much amen all serve the lord together not necessarily at this congregation which i'm very thankful for that too but that we just all serve the lord amen we spent a lot of time together which i'm very thankful for for that reason and i'll draw strength from that amen i draw strength from being with my grandchildren my daughter my son-in-law my son my wife i draw strength from all of you all the time and i i'm gonna say something to you it i i draw a tremendous amount of strength seeing you sitting there and i draw a lot of strength here standing here seeing you sitting there this morning i do it makes me and my position and the spirit the lord give me it it blesses me so much and i try not to and the lord helps me but it's very discouraging when there's only one or two of you out there it i don't mind telling you it discourages me it does and and i and i that's that's something i have to get over because where two or three are gathered amen uh i i've told you this one time before i read this when i was in florida and you know we had congregations sort of like ours 20 30 people and uh uh we had a little room where i studied and but it was kind of right next you could kind of see people come in as they come into church and you can hear the door open and hard you know just a handful of people and i got so discouraged sitting there and it was hard for me to even read the bible sitting there and and go over my notes and things and final preparation for the sermon and um and then god spoke to me and he said don't concentrate on those i'm probably paraphrasing this has been 25 years ago or 22 years ago something like that don't concentrate or worry about those who aren't here but focus on those that are yeah and i try my best to do that but i i have to be honest as a human being it gets discouraging when i step out and there's two three people it's hard but it but it conversely though uh i draw so much strength in seeing us here right we're together you mean why do you think i leave out there before anybody and shake your hand and try to greet you and say hello and i draw strength from that i draw strength from your handshake and from your greeting i do it makes a difference to me let me this i usually i meant to read this last week must have been a reason i didn't because the lord gave me a quote that i wanted to look up and it turned out that it was in this that i wanted to read last week so i said well praise god it must have been a reason i didn't read it last week not that i couldn't read it both weeks but it is the word to a church a word to the church brother adam gave in christ the mystery of god revealed i used to read this the beginning of every year i haven't done that here i'd like to do that but it's always a good reminder to us and i hope if you're streaming you're listening sitting here listening said love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let it stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving sweet kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and give him respects he'll lead you through he's ordained of god to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does listen now when he does just cling that much closer together praise the lord and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out get out or come in and be one of you that's all and that's exactly don't never clan among one or talk make yourself clannish we are one i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand i want him to stay there even a little tip of my finger i want it to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another right with one another now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline the church how we behave ourselves the church of god how we got to come here together set together in heavenly places don't stay home probably said don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder get in here and fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you get to praying because we're in the last days where the bible exalt i think he means exhorted oh it exhorted us too much more as we see that day approaching that day that is this day that day approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister say lord don't let me ever have the root of bitter to spring up because it'll affect him it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison asset of malice jealousy hatred that'll just take the holy spirit right away from you it'll run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up that uh take that buckle as the brother testified minister he said uh that vision the buckles the whole armor of god just put it on tighten up move right up close together uh to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and god will bless you yes amen what a wonderful prescription like i said i used to read that every year every january it's a good reminder to us yes amen because the enemy can come in those spirits the devil he doesn't like us standing together he doesn't like us staying as one group it doesn't like us loving one another and being and saying good things about each other he wants to separate divide and bring division and hatred that's his whole motive yeah but if we do exactly that what brother branham is just talking about we see results makes a difference i don't want to become complacent i said last week saints i don't want to become complacent here i don't want to become complacent with my walk with the lord i'm going to always the best i can continue to grow more like him to become closer to him every day amen every day praise the lord and it helps when we're together like that to become more like him praise the lord let's stand if we could amen i truly believe the lord's here now amen amen he's here to do whatever we have need of here today whatever your desire whatever we need is a congregation yes we're here together brother bannon of scripture talks about the protection of the prayer the blood over a specific individual assembly and each church has it each church has it yes and when when one goes out and or they transfer to a a different assembly then they fall under the protection of the blood of that assembly whatever happens in this assembly to those who have counted themselves as a part of that group happens to the whole assembly it affects the whole assembly it makes a difference that's why we come together in that love and that unity and that peace and the sweetness the brother brown just hold on the holy spirit together loving one another pray for one another then you see things happen right and you see god move you see a person on a deathbed rise up and come out of there amen like brother charlie was you know that's exactly what the doctors told teresa i'm not sure if she wanted me to share this but that's exactly what the doctors told her when she was at home sick had pneumonia the doctors the doctor called her at home and said yours your husband will die of cocaine that's what they said no that's not what god said that's not what i'm gonna say yes amen i'm going to believe the word that says we're two or three or gathered and our uh by his stripes he is healed and we're going to believe that as we gather together amen the same for sister priscilla and sister and the sicknesses the things that the devil's just been trying to attack us with amen he is already a defeated foe yes praise the lord amen listening this course you probably know it that's going to have us turn to it but we probably know greater is he that is in me amen than he that is in the world do you believe that today yes amen yes sir [Music] [Applause] [Music] tells us is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all [Music] the whole is know [Music] amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but god has promised us today is overcoming amen [Music] [Music] amen thank you jesus praise the lord praise the lord greater is he that is in us praise the lord then he that is in the world praise god i know there's very important stories that we read in the bible where single men have done outstanding things but a lot of times it takes it takes more than one two three group congregation if uh satan comes at you like a roaring lion and you're all by yourself over here weak and depleted how much chance you think that lion has it getting a hold of right right amen but if you're with a group and you're with people and you've been strengthened in the word speaking the whole and that whole group comes against that lion he didn't have a chance that's right amen praise the lord let's cinch and bind brother graham said that buckle sign it sent you mind that much closer together amen we're not always able to be together amen but in heart and paul wrote most of all these letters here from prison he wasn't able to be with them many times he says i'm not able to be with you in the flesh but you take your assembly and you come closer to god you get closer together even if i'm not able to be there praise the lord amen there's value to that that's why satan fights it so hard it's a prevalent spirit of this world today of this country especially and you see that's satan's eating that's why that's why we resist that so much amen praise the lord god bless you love you appreciate each one of you come and be here today and remember i did mention uh during the summer of the sermon harmony in the desert is this week starts wednesday it's going to be at the tucson tabernacle i'm assuming it's going to be the same times so i don't have a flyer or anything but i'm sure if you looked it up you could find it if you're interested in going as a result of that we will not have service here wednesday night in lieu of the service they'll the starting of harmony will be at the tucson tabernacle so it'll be the tucson tabernacle wednesday night thursday night friday night saturday night sunday afternoon amen so remember that if you can't go or not able to go then please pray for them if you can go lord i believe the lord will bless you richly for doing that we're also going to be having a minister's meeting uh this friday at amazing grace tabernacle at 10 o'clock so please pray for us pray for the brothers and we usually have a minister's meeting the first three we had was been in phoenix but because of harmony and different people they anticipated coming from out of state for harmony that we'd have it now here in tucson so that's going to be saturday so please remember us brothers in prayer it's also another one of those gatherings it's also another one of those assembling together amen and that's what we do so and we try to do it to try to get closer to the lord get closer to them one another as ministers and love and hopefully result in all of us becoming closer together amen i believe that's the purpose and it's a it's i hope that's the trust that's the purpose in every one of us that comes hard so please remember us in prayer though it's a lot of spirits a lot of people a lot of men a lot of different ideas there's already been you know things said but that just man don't worry about that you just roll over the top and keep going but sure appreciate your prayers for that uh if you would remember the prayer requests we had here uh it's good to see sister norman back and well the lord touched her and so thankful for that god bless each one of you uh i also wanted to uh remind you as far as the restroom is concerned uh i keep the little heater in there to because the women's heater works good so i just turned it on when i come if it gets too hot you can adjust the knob i don't like coming in and out of the ladies room but just to do that but the men's room doesn't so that's why you see the heater in there if it gets too hot turn it off i don't ever go in there so if y'all happen to go in the men's room and it's getting warm or something you can just turn the heater off but it's really cold there in the morning so when i come in so just remember and i keep it unlocked so i see people grabbing the key you don't need the key uh i unlock it we only did it that one time when we had the dinner so that because that room was open but that room's not open anymore so uh just leave the bathroom door unlocked so i unlock it about 10 o'clock when people are starting to show up and just leave it unlocked for the whole service gets too confusing where's the key and some people come in with the key and they're in there and they got the key and somebody else comes in they leave lock the door and the people are stuck in there i guess you can lock it from inside just we just leave it unlocked during church so i unlock it just leave the key there and just come in and out and then when service is over uh sony goes and sprays it all down with lysol and we get our soap and lock it up and turn the heat off and stuff like that so um we'll just try to remember that keep the key in one place and it'll just be unlocked since that room is locked so you don't have to worry about that amen why does it always feel like i've forgotten something um god bless you love you appreciate you i draw a lot of strength from you amen i love you very much pray for you and your families amen god's so good to us i appreciate the lord helping me this week keeping me safe and i appreciate your prayers i wrote i put in i don't think i wrote it but i put in the recording i did wednesday night that i appreciate your prayers for me too because those are protective prayers that keep me safe too and brother rogers thank you for that because we do we do some work that's potentially very dangerous that that happened to usually was just a crazy freak thing that is like a one in a million thing uh you know you'd think you know be nicer if my one in a million was the publisher's clearinghouse showing up my front door but but it had to be the thing in the middle of the face but i'm thankful god kept that and he keeps all of us so so i appreciate your prayers for us amen god's good to us so god bless you pray something was said to bless you today and appreciate each one of you love the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord we will have we won't have wednesday but we will have a regular service here next sunday morning just like normal cancel sunday there's harmony's not until 3 o'clock or so it used to be in the afternoon so we're not i'm not concerned about that i would advise you if you are going to try to go to harmony to get there as soon as you can you know the tabernacle and how limited the parking is and if the attendance is anything like it has been in harmony in the past which i'm thinking is probably not going to be uh being the fact it's at the tabernacle and coven it's probably going to be less attended but the parking as you know the tabernacle is very limited so i would advise getting there or as early as possible if you could so that would help but anyway so god bless you love you appreciate you my gracious heavenly father lord god has come to you at the close of this service lord thank you for everything you've done for us through the week then you've given us and what you shine through us yes lord lord help us as we go our separate ways keep us safe through the rest of this week lord and may you bless harmony in the desert may it be a blessing to those who watch or attend father god and we commit everything into your hands and expect to come sunday should you tarry lord and we thank you and commit everything into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord god bless you today my so [Music] you
