[19:57] um
[19:58] let's go over some testimonies and song
[20:00] specials with anyone as long but
[20:02] i do me and our family me and my family
[20:05] have a testimony for sure
[20:09] it was friday afternoon my wife was
[20:11] going out to the store in our
[20:13] car or suv
[20:15] and they didn't get very far maybe
[20:18] five miles but they were on the freeway
[20:20] so they they were
[20:22] traveling on the freeway at 65 to 70
[20:24] miles per hour and
[20:26] uh
[20:28] she's my wife it was just my wife and my
[20:30] kids that were driving the car i was at
[20:31] work and um
[20:33] to have the started losing control of
[20:34] the car start swerving you know she
[20:36] wasn't sure what was going on and they
[20:38] ended up spinning out into the median
[20:40] um
[20:41] so i left from work you know she called
[20:43] me and um i just want to praise god that
[20:46] no one was hurt they are all fine
[20:50] uh the car is fine uh nothing we didn't
[20:52] hit anybody they didn't hit anybody they
[20:54] they didn't hit anything
[20:56] they didn't get injured in the accident
[20:58] so i mean i couldn't
[21:00] what happened i think is something to do
[21:02] with the tire um what we found out later
[21:04] is that some there was a malfunction
[21:06] with the tire
[21:07] um so i was able to get it towed home
[21:09] and uh fixed it up yesterday morning so
[21:12] i drove it around before we came today
[21:13] to just to see if anything was going on
[21:15] but
[21:17] just looking at it you wouldn't even be
[21:18] able to tell
[21:19] anything that happened to it so
[21:21] just really uh thank the lord
[21:24] in better words it's like he
[21:26] the way the car landed it was in the
[21:28] meeting a dirt median and on the freeway
[21:31] but
[21:32] it's like he landed them onto a pillow
[21:34] of just like soft dirt and there's a
[21:36] bunch of weeds and stuff but there was a
[21:38] tree maybe like 10 feet
[21:40] away you know there's railings guard
[21:41] railings they think so they spun
[21:43] into it so they could have spun into a
[21:45] car into anything but uh the lord really
[21:47] had his hand over them and amen
[21:49] blessing us with keeping them safe and
[21:52] keeping our car safe it's just it's just
[21:54] a miracle amen thank the lord this

[38:39] praise the lord you know that's one
[38:40] thing that we
[38:42] seem to forget about a lot of times
[38:45] is that it's in his time
[38:47] amen
[38:49] patience is a virtue but it's a virtue
[38:51] that seems to be very scarce nowadays
[38:54] because we always want everything
[38:56] instantly we want everything right now
[38:59] we want god to do it this very second
[39:02] but you know it's much better if we just
[39:04] allow him to do it in his time and in
[39:06] his way
[39:07] everything works out as the song says
[39:10] beautiful in his time
[39:12] amen we met we mess it up so many times
[39:16] by trying to make something happen or be
[39:19] that uh that isn't isn't to be or isn't
[39:22] the right time
[39:23] but uh the lord makes all things
[39:26] beautiful in his time
[39:28] and we got
[39:29] everything in this world it's
[39:31] instant and fast and quick and right now
[39:34] and we can fly across the country in
[39:37] three hours
[39:39] it used to take days weeks months we can
[39:42] fly in a few hours we can get around the
[39:44] world we can get on the other side of
[39:46] the world half a day
[39:48] a man can't even i don't even know how
[39:50] long it would take them to have done it
[39:51] on a boat or ship or amen and and and
[39:55] used to be they couldn't do it at all
[39:58] and
[39:59] won't even talk about rockets and things
[40:01] that shoot up into the sky and uh get to
[40:04] the moon and
[40:06] it's just incredible microwaves uh
[40:10] cars
[40:11] modern conveniences
[40:13] it never seems to be enough for humans
[40:16] but you know if we can just get along
[40:18] with the lord
[40:19] we just get still before him
[40:22] just let him do it his way his time
[40:24] we know it'll work out right amen
[40:27] praise the lord so
[40:28] i appreciate the lord's goodness to us
[40:31] amen appreciate each one of you being
[40:33] here today trust the lord just bless you
[40:35] richly there was a couple things i
[40:37] failed to mention

[41:41] certainly me and my wife can understand
[41:42] how that feels and what they're going
[41:44] through and understanding that there's
[41:46] no way we could have ever even attempted
[41:48] to imagine going through it without the
[41:50] lord jesus
[41:52] but the funeral is this wednesday so
[41:54] what did you ask would ask that you
[41:56] would pray for them pray for the family
[41:59] and all those that are involved you know
[42:01] the lord has the way and a reason for
[42:03] doing things sometimes you may never
[42:05] know what that reason is
[42:07] maybe this short of the other side but
[42:09] god has everything under control but
[42:11] again i just pray that you would
[42:13] i'd ask that you'd pray for them pray
[42:15] for the family and those with the
[42:17] passing of this baby and also next
[42:20] saturday uh sister norma's daughter
[42:23] kathy and daniel who made our pulpit are

[42:29] that you'd uh ask to pray for them and
[42:31] pray for the marriage the union
[42:33] everything uh there that it would go

[43:10] taliban is starting to go door to door
[43:12] checking for christians
[43:14] checking their phones for bible apps and
[43:17] stuff like that
[43:19] so just pray for them if you would
[43:21] also
[43:23] there's a category four or five
[43:25] hurricane hitting new orleans right now
[43:28] and louisiana
[43:30] new orleans i'm sorry but it's a very
[43:34] wicked city uh been there a couple times
[43:37] is all it's a it is a hotbed for demonic
[43:40] spirits but i know a lot of precious
[43:43] brothers and sisters that live in that
[43:45] vicinity not necessarily new orleans
[43:47] proper but in that vicinity around uh so
[43:50] just pray for them pray for the people
[43:52] pray for the christians the bride the
[43:55] uh god's children
[43:57] uh it looks like it's going to be a a
[44:00] pretty bad storm according to all the
[44:02] prognostications so
[44:04] uh ask you to pray for a lot lot praying
[44:06] for amen
[44:08] but we know the one who is listening we
[44:11] know the one who asked us to ask
[44:13] and we'll answer our needs according to
[44:15] his riches and glory amen so let's
[44:18] remember that and again i appreciate the
[44:21] lord's goodness appreciate each one of
[44:22] you being here today those who may be
[44:24] streaming lord bless you richly i'm
[44:26] thankful that brother angel
[44:28] third there seemed there seemed to have
[44:30] been all my texting
[44:32] some confusion
[44:34] angel third is priscilla's husband and
[44:37] the father of
[44:39] uh the five children that come here with
[44:42] uh uh savannah and shira and uh
[44:45] always give them to moses and savannah
[44:48] and uh and uh cheyenne and serenity and
[44:51] mariah
[44:54] that's angel third angel jr is his
[44:57] father who is genevieve's
[45:00] husband
[45:01] okay so there there's there's not a
[45:04] there's not an angel senior involved in
[45:06] this in fact i think angel seniors
[45:08] passed away if i'm correct with that
[45:10] this is we're referring to angel jr and
[45:12] angel third
[45:14] angel third who
[45:17] tested negative for covid and is doing
[45:19] better he told me yesterday he is doing
[45:22] better uh the infection's going away
[45:24] he's getting his strength back he's
[45:25] being able to have a conversation
[45:27] without losing his breath
[45:28] uh so apparently the pneumonia is
[45:30] lifting
[45:31] so we're very thankful for that but
[45:33] angel junior is still in the hospital
[45:35] and put him in icu yesterday
[45:39] it doesn't sound like he's getting
[45:41] better but it doesn't sound like he's
[45:42] getting worse
[45:44] he's able to talk to angel and as far as
[45:48] i can
[45:48] recall
[45:49] uh and
[45:51] but but he's in icu now and they've got
[45:53] him on antibiotics and things like that
[45:55] so uh continue to remember the freyjol
[45:58] family and of course angel jr being in
[46:01] the hospital and genevieve of course
[46:03] sister jenny we call her here
[46:05] remember her in prayer too she
[46:08] had been quite discouraged over this
[46:10] period of time and understandably so
[46:12] so please remember them in prayer as
[46:14] well if you will amen let's stand to our
[46:16] feet again if we could and turn in our
[46:19] bibles to first thessalonians chapter 4.
[46:22] we're on the rapture part 11.
[46:28] amen the rapture part 11.
[46:31] it's kind of a continuation of the last
[46:33] few services but with a little caveat to
[46:35] it um
[46:37] it's it's we're going to continue on a
[46:39] little bit with the with the condition
[46:41] of the world at the time of rapture and
[46:44] uh i want to
[46:46] if there's going to be a subtitle i
[46:47] haven't been subtitling the micah has so
[46:50] if you go on the website
[46:52] which i hope you go on the website maybe
[46:54] at least weekly daily whatever but if
[46:56] you go on the website you'll see micah's
[46:58] put a subtitle to each one that's come
[47:00] like after part four or five uh to each
[47:03] one of these and i guess if i were to
[47:05] put a subtitle on this one it would be
[47:06] the signs in heaven and earth
[47:09] the signs that are to be in heaven and
[47:11] in earth amen so the rapture part 11. so
[47:14] we'll read this person of the scripture
[47:16] against first thessalonians chapter 4
[47:18] verse 13 the rapture um
[47:21] scripture for will but before we do
[47:23] let's just bow our heads for another
[47:24] word of prayer
[47:26] precious jesus
[47:28] father it's indeed a privilege lord
[47:30] to come in here and honor you once again
[47:33] lord and believing expecting you to meet
[47:35] with us father on this hallowed
[47:37] ground in this hallowed place lord
[47:39] that's been dedicated consecrated for
[47:42] service for you lord expecting and
[47:44] believing you god that you are here lord
[47:46] and that you move them in and out
[47:48] amongst the avenues of our heart lord
[47:51] that you touch and bless and strengthen
[47:53] us in every way god help those who may
[47:55] not have been able to make it today
[47:58] those you may be streaming father and
[47:59] each one that's here we just pray that
[48:01] your holy spirit would abound once again
[48:05] lord and and touch each one god each
[48:08] sick and body needy lord of many
[48:10] requests and many desires and many needs
[48:12] father that there are out there today
[48:14] god and in our little congregation but
[48:17] we believe father that you are the giver
[48:19] of every good gift lord and that you are
[48:21] our healer you are our great physician
[48:23] you are our family physician lord and we
[48:26] thank you so much that you are touched
[48:27] by the feeling of our infirmities it's
[48:30] so good lord to hear the wonderful
[48:32] positive blessed testimonies lord of you
[48:35] in our lives god and what you do for us
[48:37] and lord is so good to know that your
[48:39] hand is upon us in every way and no
[48:41] matter what it may look like god to us
[48:43] and what the circumstances may present
[48:46] themselves as we know god that out all
[48:49] things work together for the good of
[48:51] those that love you and we love you lord
[48:54] the world there's a lot of people in the
[48:56] world today they have a a passing
[48:58] affection for you lord they might have a
[49:00] little uh
[49:02] a little uh
[49:05] like for you lord
[49:07] as the world would say god but but
[49:09] there's a group of people lord that have
[49:11] an unconditional gophel love for you
[49:14] lord and those are the people that trust
[49:16] you that believe you god that all things
[49:18] work together for our good even if we
[49:20] don't understand it lord
[49:22] and god i pray that your holy spirit
[49:24] would come again once again now
[49:26] and lord as we've turned back the pages
[49:28] of this bible to speak to us from your
[49:30] word it'll not return void father and i
[49:33] believing that you're accomplishing that
[49:35] in each one of us as you would see fit
[49:38] we just give you the praise honor and
[49:39] glory and rebuke every demonic spirit
[49:42] that would try to hurt hinder or
[49:43] infiltrate this service in any way that
[49:46] you would get the glory and the praise
[49:48] the honor for all that is said and done
[49:49] here may it be a
[49:51] sweet smelling savior to you as we
[49:53] offered in the name of the lord jesus
[49:55] christ we pray amen amen
[49:58] first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not
[50:00] have you to be ignorant brother
[50:02] concerning them once you're asleep that
[50:04] you sorrow not even as others which have
[50:06] no hope for if we believe that jesus
[50:08] died and rose again even so them also
[50:11] which slip sleep in jesus will god bring
[50:14] with him for this we say unto you by the
[50:16] word of the lord that we were to alive
[50:18] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[50:20] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[50:22] for the lord himself shall descend from
[50:25] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[50:27] the archangel with the trump of god and
[50:29] the dead in christ shall rise first
[50:31] then we which are alive and remain shall
[50:33] be caught up together with them in the
[50:34] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[50:37] so shall we ever be with the lord
[50:39] wherefore comfort one another with these
[50:41] words
[50:42] amen you can be seated if you'd like
[50:46] amen i took a little part when i was
[50:48] been a couple weeks a week since
[50:50] ministering here uh it's strange when
[50:52] you
[50:53] uh basically minister every service for
[50:56] as long as it is and then there's a
[50:59] couple of weeks there where
[51:00] you you don't minister at least not here
[51:03] a couple weeks ago in san diego there's
[51:06] a little bit of a struggle um
[51:08] uh preaching through an interpreter i've
[51:10] preached
[51:11] through interpreters many times but uh
[51:14] when you're not used to it and it's not
[51:15] something you do on a on an ongoing
[51:17] basis it can be a little bit challenging
[51:20] so
[51:21] i'm thankful that uh you all here or
[51:24] americans or
[51:25] or here we know english and speak
[51:28] english and we don't have to have
[51:30] interpretation here so uh i think it
[51:32] makes a little bit a little bit better a
[51:34] little more the spirit flows and i
[51:37] appreciate god's goodness so now
[51:40] again we want to talk um i want to talk
[51:42] about the the rapture part 11 and about
[51:45] uh the signs in the heaven and earth
[51:49] amen the science in heaven and earth
[51:51] at the time of rapture all this of
[51:53] course uh
[51:54] is the accumulation of what we're
[51:56] looking to in the scripture of rapturing
[51:59] condition we talked about rapturing
[52:01] condition of a group of people we talked
[52:03] about rapture and condition of the world
[52:05] and and now we talk about the rapture
[52:07] and condition of the signs that jesus
[52:09] told us that we look to the heavens and
[52:12] in the earth so let's go to saint luke
[52:14] chapter 21.
[52:16] amen and we'll uh begin our scripture
[52:19] reading there
[52:21] verse 5. now
[52:24] um
[52:25] saint saint luke chapter 21
[52:28] is
[52:29] is the same
[52:31] segment that we read the other day in
[52:34] matthew 24. matthew 24 and saint luke 21
[52:39] are the same account of that event that
[52:42] his disciples came to jesus and was
[52:44] asking in those questions
[52:47] i picked saint luke 21 this time because
[52:51] it's there's a couple of other points
[52:53] that are made in here that matthew
[52:56] doesn't make in matthew 24. so man uh
[52:59] saint luke
[53:00] chapter 21
[53:02] we'll begin reading with verse 5
[53:05] saint luke 21 5. and as some spake of
[53:08] the temple how it was adorned with
[53:09] goodly uh goodly stones and gifts
[53:12] he said as for these things which ye be
[53:15] held behold the days will come in the
[53:18] which there shall not be left one stone
[53:20] upon another that shall not be thrown
[53:23] down
[53:24] and they asked him saying master
[53:26] but when shall these things be and what
[53:29] this and and what sign will there be
[53:32] when these things shall come to pass
[53:34] and he said take heed that ye be not
[53:37] deceived now it's the same thing the
[53:39] same thing the first warning that jesus
[53:42] gave that was recorded in matthew is the
[53:44] same
[53:45] first warning that's given by jesus here
[53:48] in saint luke take heed that you be not
[53:50] deceived for many shall come in my name
[53:53] saying i am christ
[53:54] and the time draweth near go ye not
[53:57] therefore after them but when ye shall
[54:00] hear of wars and commotions be not
[54:02] terrified for these things must come
[54:05] must first come to pass but the end is
[54:08] not by and by or is not yet
[54:11] then said they unto him nation uh
[54:14] unto them nations shall rise against
[54:16] nation and kingdom against kingdom and
[54:18] great earthquakes shall be in diverse
[54:21] places and famines and pestilence
[54:24] and fearful sights and great signs shall
[54:27] there be from heaven
[54:28] but before all these things they shall
[54:31] lay their hands on you and persecute you
[54:34] and uh delivering you up to the
[54:36] synagogues and into prisons being
[54:39] brought before kings and rulers for my
[54:41] name's sake
[54:42] so now i i want to continue on a drop
[54:45] down in
[54:46] in the same chapter but i want to focus
[54:48] on
[54:49] verse 11 right now jesus said there will
[54:53] be great earthquakes not just
[54:55] earthquakes
[54:56] but great earthquakes
[54:58] shall be in divers places now that word
[55:02] divers is diverse or
[55:04] multiple numerous
[55:07] okay so the earthquake seismic activity
[55:11] is supposed to be on a dramatic increase
[55:14] at the time of the rapture at the time
[55:16] of the end when all these things begin
[55:19] to unfold
[55:20] the the seismic earthquake activity is
[55:23] supposed to be increased to a place that
[55:26] it becomes more and more prevalent and
[55:28] noticeable
[55:30] diverse places numerous many okay
[55:33] diverse places that maybe didn't even
[55:35] know before of earthquakes taking place
[55:38] so well there's never been an earthquake
[55:40] there before well it's never been an end
[55:42] time like there's been now yeah amen
[55:44] that's why the things are happening the
[55:46] way they are so well it's never been
[55:47] like that before of course now the world
[55:50] they think they have an excuse they
[55:52] think they have a reason because they
[55:54] call it climate change well climate
[55:56] change to me i mean there's probably
[55:58] some truth to that but they what they
[56:00] don't realize that that it's scriptural
[56:03] they want to make it scientific or uh or
[56:06] all the other things that go on with
[56:08] what they can control and understand
[56:10] see the supernatural things they can't
[56:12] control the supernatural things they
[56:15] don't understand so they have to try to
[56:17] justify it in a way that they can try to
[56:20] put it in a little box and say well it's
[56:22] because of this
[56:24] i mean
[56:25] there's been
[56:26] such ridiculous
[56:28] things come out about that i heard
[56:31] somebody this week blaming the rise of
[56:34] al qaeda on climate change
[56:37] i mean that's how ridiculous this thing
[56:39] is to me it's not it's more of a money
[56:42] maker than anything i mean you look at
[56:44] the high people that are up there say
[56:46] like an al gore i mean they've become
[56:48] multi-millionaires just because they
[56:49] preach this i'm not saying there's not
[56:52] some climate change i'm not saying that
[56:54] amen
[56:55] the climate's getting ready to change
[56:57] because it's september's this week and
[56:59] it's gonna start getting cooler and
[57:01] climate change a couple months ago and
[57:02] it really started raining here pretty
[57:04] good climate change didn't it got real
[57:05] humid outside anyway i'm not i'm not
[57:08] saying that there's not a little truth
[57:10] to that because brother banner said men
[57:12] would destroy themselves right and
[57:14] that's the place we're getting to that
[57:17] this is happening all of the pulling out
[57:19] of the of the minerals and and the oil
[57:22] and the deposits in the earth
[57:24] you can't do that and not expect there
[57:27] to be a ripple effect
[57:28] if you go look in a tub of water and you
[57:31] reach in uh to grab a stone at the
[57:34] bottom of the water there's gonna be a
[57:35] rippling effect to your hand entering in
[57:37] the water and pulling that stone out
[57:39] right now it might not be significant to
[57:42] you to look at but there's going to be a
[57:44] change there's going to be an effect and
[57:47] when you keep dipping into this earth
[57:49] pulling all the stuff out of it there's
[57:50] going to be an effect there's going to
[57:52] be a change to the to the makeup of this
[57:55] earth for that reason men are killing
[57:58] themselves and then and then
[58:01] the earth starts groaning and the earth
[58:03] starts shaking and the earth starts
[58:05] belching and that's exactly what's going
[58:07] on but we know that it is scriptural to
[58:10] be doing that because there's going to
[58:12] be earthquakes in different places
[58:15] there's going to be these
[58:17] these famines
[58:18] and pestilence and fearful great sights
[58:22] in earth and in heaven
[58:24] things that they never knew before
[58:27] to my knowledge there's still huge fires
[58:30] roaring in california
[58:32] oregon washing nothing why is it there
[58:35] you think you look around the rest of
[58:37] the country and they say they blame all
[58:38] that on climate change but
[58:40] but why is it in all the rest of the
[58:42] country
[58:44] oh sure we have some fires here in
[58:46] arizona but as far as i know they're all
[58:47] out
[58:48] we have fires in other parts of the
[58:50] country but as far as i know most if not
[58:52] all of them are out but the west coast
[58:54] is still burning to the ground
[58:56] why
[58:58] see
[58:59] you you can say it's one thing but when
[59:01] you isolate it down and you realize
[59:03] there's something more going on than
[59:05] just what science can say they can prove
[59:08] that's right and what they can put in a
[59:10] little box and say it's xyz and they
[59:13] label that xyz or climate change or
[59:16] whatever and they label it this and now
[59:18] they've got an explanation to tell you
[59:21] why things are happening the way they're
[59:23] happening
[59:25] what are they doing
[59:26] they're circumventing everything that's
[59:29] in this in the scripture that tells us
[59:32] why it's happening that way you cannot
[59:34] put god in a box
[59:36] you cannot put the holy spirit in a box
[59:39] you can't just say here's god in this
[59:42] little square like denominations do and
[59:44] say this is all god is
[59:47] this is who god is this is all god is
[59:50] and this is what we know and what we
[59:52] have about god when friend you can't do
[59:54] that
[59:56] you can't put the supernatural in a box
[59:58] you can't put god in a boss you can't
[1:00:01] say well it's
[1:00:03] this is all there is to god and that's
[1:00:05] all there's going to be
[1:00:06] it doesn't work that way and when they
[1:00:09] can't explain it
[1:00:11] when they can't deny it because it's you
[1:00:13] know it's here you can't deny it you
[1:00:16] can't explain it then they get to the
[1:00:18] place that they gotta figure out somehow
[1:00:21] that they can say oh
[1:00:22] world
[1:00:24] now remember
[1:00:25] this allowed to see an age more than any
[1:00:27] age because god described it that way is
[1:00:30] a prideful age
[1:00:33] we are built up and and and puffed up in
[1:00:37] pride this age just lay out the cnh by
[1:00:40] by description revelation 3 is a
[1:00:43] prideful age
[1:00:45] and and as smart as intelligent as these
[1:00:48] people are they feel like they have got
[1:00:51] to be able to explain everything
[1:00:54] because they're so smart right we know
[1:00:56] everything
[1:00:57] and they've got to do that if they want
[1:01:00] to portray themselves to the world as
[1:01:02] god
[1:01:04] if the government and medicine and
[1:01:06] science is the ultimate in this world
[1:01:09] which is what they'll preach to you
[1:01:11] they're the ultimate don't you dare
[1:01:14] question their authority
[1:01:15] don't you dare bring up the fact that a
[1:01:17] hundred years ago
[1:01:19] scientific facts are not even close to
[1:01:22] what they've proven to be today
[1:01:26] don't even begin to touch the medical
[1:01:28] world or the government oh they know it
[1:01:30] all
[1:01:31] and don't don't don't even dare to begin
[1:01:34] to question their authority because
[1:01:36] you're wrong and you'll be what they
[1:01:38] call today canceled because you because
[1:01:42] they know better they're prideful they
[1:01:44] have to be able to explain everything
[1:01:47] reason away
[1:01:49] things that are happening in this earth
[1:01:51] today that only christians and dares i
[1:01:54] say only god's bride when he breaks it
[1:01:57] right down to it know what is going on
[1:02:00] amen they know it because they see it in
[1:02:03] the scripture they know it because god's
[1:02:05] revealed it to them they know it because
[1:02:08] we have that anointing of the holy ghost
[1:02:11] that is leading us in that way and as
[1:02:13] god does that he reveals himself to us
[1:02:16] to help us know this is that time
[1:02:19] this is what's going on that's the
[1:02:21] greatest sign we can have to recognize
[1:02:24] that this is a rapturing day
[1:02:27] this is a day for rapture
[1:02:29] earthquakes
[1:02:31] shall be in diverse places famines
[1:02:33] pestilence you say brother newton
[1:02:35] there's been pestilence and there's been
[1:02:37] people sick for uh
[1:02:40] and hungary and famines that that's been
[1:02:42] going on for for hundreds of years if
[1:02:45] not thousands of years that's true but
[1:02:48] when you start adding all of the things
[1:02:50] up and you start
[1:02:52] grouping them into a
[1:02:54] into a group
[1:02:56] because
[1:02:57] jesus didn't just say this is going to
[1:03:00] happen
[1:03:02] or this is going to happen
[1:03:04] he said this and this and this and this
[1:03:08] and this and this is all going to happen
[1:03:12] it's all going to come together
[1:03:14] it's all going to be there at one time
[1:03:17] and all these things are going to happen
[1:03:19] to the point that men begin to die
[1:03:22] because of the fear of their hearts yes
[1:03:25] amen amen
[1:03:27] earthquakes
[1:03:28] in different places in diverse places
[1:03:31] volcanoes
[1:03:32] sas seismic activity extreme weather
[1:03:37] um
[1:03:40] i've had people tell me in the past
[1:03:42] couple of weeks my son has an app on his
[1:03:44] phone i think sister sheila has pointed
[1:03:46] out we saw the earthquake in haiti again
[1:03:49] of of all the shakings that are going on
[1:03:51] around this country and around the world
[1:03:53] now it is constant yes this this earth
[1:03:58] uh this earth is is is
[1:04:01] is having a
[1:04:03] gastronomical jubilee it is belching and
[1:04:06] burping so much underneath the surface
[1:04:08] it's rocking and rolling places all
[1:04:11] around the world
[1:04:12] continuously
[1:04:14] not just a little earthquake here not
[1:04:16] just a little something over there
[1:04:18] but continually
[1:04:20] and there's going to continue to be
[1:04:23] great earthquakes
[1:04:25] in these multiple places
[1:04:28] because that's what god said i read an
[1:04:30] article a couple of weeks ago that there
[1:04:32] were six active volcanoes on the uh
[1:04:36] through the alaskan islands
[1:04:39] down through their six volcanoes active
[1:04:42] at one time
[1:04:44] just along the islands now they don't
[1:04:45] report it so much you don't hear it very
[1:04:47] much because it's not inhabited it's not
[1:04:50] affecting directly affecting people from
[1:04:52] but this is going on as we know it right
[1:04:55] now
[1:04:56] and and
[1:04:57] and we can see it we can know it and it
[1:05:00] helps us to realize that these that
[1:05:02] these pestilence
[1:05:04] that are happening today
[1:05:05] uh that this
[1:05:07] i now personally i believe it probably
[1:05:10] came out of a lab but it wasn't that
[1:05:12] wasn't an accident
[1:05:14] it was all purposeful friend
[1:05:17] and and now variant upon variant or
[1:05:19] whatever they're saying is gonna happen
[1:05:21] now i don't know
[1:05:22] i i i honestly um
[1:05:26] i i don't
[1:05:29] freak out about it it's
[1:05:31] i i want this to sound right i don't
[1:05:34] want this to sound bad i mean i attended
[1:05:36] the funeral of two precious friends last
[1:05:38] week that died of kobe but so i don't
[1:05:40] want to understate it but i want to
[1:05:42] understand look friend that
[1:05:45] is is not something that's that's
[1:05:47] adversely affecting my life it's just
[1:05:50] not
[1:05:51] uh
[1:05:53] it's
[1:05:55] it's not something that uh that that
[1:05:57] rolls my spirit over it it just doesn't
[1:06:01] it's these pestilences that's going on
[1:06:02] in the world today and look
[1:06:05] could covet
[1:06:06] let me ask you this could covet just be
[1:06:09] one of the beginnings of that
[1:06:12] i remember when aids come out oh my they
[1:06:14] had no cure for aids and everybody was
[1:06:16] going crazy about aids and then of
[1:06:17] course it was a rebuke on the gay
[1:06:19] community and things like that but the
[1:06:21] whole point was it was nothing then you
[1:06:23] had uh sarge you had n1h1 or h1n1 or
[1:06:27] i've heard the the pig flu swine flu the
[1:06:30] the chicken flu the the cow flu the uh
[1:06:32] and it's just it just keeps building and
[1:06:35] building well now they've got something
[1:06:37] that has
[1:06:38] that has actually struck fear in the
[1:06:40] hearts of people yeah
[1:06:42] uh
[1:06:43] when all this other stuff was going on
[1:06:45] it's like well okay you know and moving
[1:06:47] on and yeah thousands of people died
[1:06:50] but
[1:06:51] they've gotten everything positioned
[1:06:54] understand me now the government
[1:06:57] the medical community the world at large
[1:07:01] they've gotten this perfect storm now
[1:07:03] with coven
[1:07:05] to where they've struck
[1:07:06] fear in the hearts of people
[1:07:09] and when they get fear on the people is
[1:07:12] when they can bring control on the
[1:07:15] people
[1:07:16] and when
[1:07:17] when someone else
[1:07:21] listen to me when somebody or something
[1:07:24] else can gain control over you
[1:07:28] you will forget and lose your identity
[1:07:32] yes and when you lose your identity and
[1:07:35] you don't realize who you are
[1:07:37] you can't have faith
[1:07:39] and without faith it's impossible to
[1:07:41] please god
[1:07:42] and without faith you'll never go on a
[1:07:44] rapture
[1:07:45] if you lose that identity friend that
[1:07:48] and that's exactly what people are doing
[1:07:51] call them names you can put just robot
[1:07:54] one robot two robot three because that's
[1:07:57] all the humanity is becoming
[1:08:00] controlled and manipulated by the powers
[1:08:02] that be
[1:08:04] all that's a part of what we see in the
[1:08:07] scripture
[1:08:08] you say well that's a that's a big leap
[1:08:11] brother knew i don't think it is
[1:08:13] because it all brings down to the
[1:08:16] laodicean church age this end time age
[1:08:19] to help us the bride recognize the
[1:08:22] rapturing time that we're living
[1:08:25] the fulfillment of scripture where all
[1:08:28] these not just a pestilence
[1:08:30] not just a famine not just an earthquake
[1:08:32] here or there but the accumulation of
[1:08:35] all of the things that jesus mentioned
[1:08:37] coming to a head at one time right now
[1:08:40] or in our in
[1:08:42] plentiful supply
[1:08:45] now let me continue let's drop down to
[1:08:47] the 25th verse
[1:08:50] amen and keep in mind let me read the
[1:08:52] 11th verse again first and great
[1:08:54] earthquakes shall be in diverse places
[1:08:57] famines and pestilence
[1:09:00] and fearful sights and great signs shall
[1:09:04] there be from heaven 25th verse and
[1:09:07] there shall be signs in the sun and in
[1:09:09] the moon and in the stars and upon the
[1:09:12] earth distress of nations with
[1:09:15] perplexity
[1:09:16] the sea and the waves roaring
[1:09:20] why are the seas and the waves roaring
[1:09:22] because the earth beneath it beneath it
[1:09:25] is shaking and rocking and belching
[1:09:27] that's why
[1:09:29] because everything around it the seismic
[1:09:32] activity has the effect on the water
[1:09:34] that is that it's housing this earth is
[1:09:37] housing the water and when the earth
[1:09:39] begins to move and shake then it has an
[1:09:42] effect on the water look at the big
[1:09:44] tsunamis that have happened and white
[1:09:47] people and and towns really off the map
[1:09:50] just swept it right onto the ocean
[1:09:54] amen thousands of people
[1:09:57] but there's going to be distress
[1:10:00] distress of nations
[1:10:02] now
[1:10:04] with the current
[1:10:06] conditions that's happened
[1:10:09] with this with governmental decisions
[1:10:11] that have been made and yes i'm talking
[1:10:13] about the united states
[1:10:16] you see now a distress among nations
[1:10:20] even some of the closest allies the
[1:10:23] united states has is criticizing the
[1:10:26] united states
[1:10:28] actually see some people in power
[1:10:33] in other nations
[1:10:35] are saying they will no longer rely on
[1:10:38] or support the united states
[1:10:41] well where does that put us friend i
[1:10:43] mean we're the most powerful nation on
[1:10:45] the earth still greatest place to live i
[1:10:47] believe but
[1:10:49] we can't do it alone
[1:10:51] we have to have people that that are on
[1:10:54] our side
[1:10:55] now it's becoming it's almost to the
[1:10:58] place i won't say it is but it's
[1:11:00] seemingly almost to the place that it's
[1:11:03] each country for itself
[1:11:06] each country looking out for their own
[1:11:08] interests
[1:11:09] looking out for their own way and saying
[1:11:12] you know what
[1:11:13] we're gonna take care of number one
[1:11:16] now if we can do anything to help you we
[1:11:18] might right if it's in our best interest
[1:11:22] amen and i don't have a problem with
[1:11:25] that i honestly think that was donald
[1:11:27] trump's philosophy the united states
[1:11:30] first and will help you in every chance
[1:11:32] that we get as long as it helps it
[1:11:34] doesn't denigrate our country
[1:11:36] right now that's out the window but
[1:11:39] the world
[1:11:41] the world scene now is at the place at
[1:11:45] at great distress amongst one another's
[1:11:48] with perplexity now you might not
[1:11:50] understand what that word means i didn't
[1:11:53] i had a working knowledge of it but i
[1:11:55] looked the definition perplexity means
[1:11:58] unable
[1:12:00] unwilling or or
[1:12:02] not able not unwilling but unable
[1:12:06] to be able to take care
[1:12:08] of conditions they don't understand
[1:12:13] now today
[1:12:14] in in a perplexed society
[1:12:18] we have having multiple things that are
[1:12:20] going on that men and governments and
[1:12:24] countries
[1:12:25] have no idea what to do about it
[1:12:30] they don't have the answer now they're
[1:12:32] going to make something up
[1:12:35] they're going to do the best they can
[1:12:36] and of course they're going to control
[1:12:38] the people in the meantime
[1:12:40] they're going to do the best they can to
[1:12:42] try to put a a put a box around it and
[1:12:44] say it's x y or z
[1:12:47] but the truth is they have no idea
[1:12:51] they are unable to tackle the dilemmas
[1:12:55] that are hitting this world today
[1:12:57] nobody has the answer
[1:12:59] he said biden's a horrible president i
[1:13:01] agree
[1:13:02] but
[1:13:03] donald trump didn't have the answer for
[1:13:05] this
[1:13:06] amen you know who has the answer christ
[1:13:10] god his word there's no government
[1:13:13] there's no nation there's no president
[1:13:15] or governing body that has the answer
[1:13:19] falci doesn't have the answer
[1:13:21] the medical field the science world they
[1:13:24] don't have the answer
[1:13:26] the only answer is in christ in his word
[1:13:28] that's the only answer
[1:13:30] and if you follow him and let him reveal
[1:13:32] that word to you and live according to
[1:13:34] just a good godly humble christian life
[1:13:37] then god will reveal to you and when
[1:13:39] it's time god will take you home
[1:13:41] that's the rapture and conviction seeing
[1:13:43] the perplexity that's going on they
[1:13:46] don't have the answers
[1:13:48] for many years they've had the answers
[1:13:50] they don't there is no answer today

[1:14:42] not the answer
[1:14:44] the answer lies in christ in his word
[1:14:47] it's the only place there's an answer
[1:14:49] the answer is to understand we're living
[1:14:51] in perilous times
[1:14:53] the answers to understand by the word of
[1:14:55] god jesus said what it would be like and
[1:14:58] it's here amen is it going to be today i

[1:16:27] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:16:29] glory and when these things begin to
[1:16:31] come to pass when these things begin to

[1:17:11] one more verse 36 look at this now 36
[1:17:14] verse this is the beautiful ending to
[1:17:15] this
[1:17:19] 36 watch ye
[1:17:21] are you listening you're listening
[1:17:23] streaming
[1:17:24] read with me
[1:17:26] watch you therefore and pray always
[1:17:30] are we doing that yes amen
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:35] watch ye therefore
[1:17:38] and pray always
[1:17:40] are we doing that i'll say it again
[1:17:43] i'm not
[1:17:44] i know michael is very jubilant in his
[1:17:47] uh uh
[1:17:49] answer but you don't you don't have to
[1:17:51] answer
[1:17:52] you know it's in your heart you know
[1:17:54] you're streaming you know if you watch
[1:17:56] this you know
[1:17:57] watch ye therefore and pray always
[1:18:00] why
[1:18:02] that ye may be accounted worthy to do
[1:18:04] what
[1:18:05] escape
[1:18:08] amen you know what that means that means
[1:18:10] with all this that we just read and all
[1:18:12] that we just said and everything that's
[1:18:14] going on in our lives in this country
[1:18:16] around the world can be escaped
[1:18:19] there is a way of escape
[1:18:22] amen that you're accounted worthy to
[1:18:24] escape all these things that shall come
[1:18:27] to pass and to stand before the son of
[1:18:30] man

[1:18:34] ye be found worthy to escape
[1:18:38] to escape so if there is a way of escape

[1:18:44] his children not to become privy or or
[1:18:47] or
[1:18:48] subjects of
[1:18:50] of this end time hallelujah
[1:18:53] has provided a way of escape for her

[1:19:01] that the death angel pass
[1:19:04] god's bride is safe amen at last right
[1:19:08] and though death angel sweeping through
[1:19:11] the place god took care of his children
[1:19:14] death didn't touch his people
[1:19:16] there was a way of escape god always
[1:19:19] makes a way of escape for his people
[1:19:21] let this death angel pass because the
[1:19:24] bride is safe
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] where is she safe in that token
[1:19:29] the holy ghost the inoculation that god
[1:19:33] has given his bride for this last day we
[1:19:35] are safe
[1:19:37] there should be no men's hearts failing
[1:19:39] for fear amongst the children of god
[1:19:41] because they're brought they are safe
[1:19:43] amen
[1:19:44] safe in christ safe in his word

[1:21:50] judgment
[1:21:52] then comes sudden destruction and in
[1:21:55] spite of all their carnal preparations
[1:21:58] they will still be unprepared for what
[1:22:00] comes upon the earth carnal preparations
[1:22:04] they build better buildings in
[1:22:06] california
[1:22:08] oh it we stand withstand all these

[1:22:12] levees and stuff in new orleans to help
[1:22:14] the water and thing pump pump all the
[1:22:16] water that we've made everything so much
[1:22:18] better
[1:22:20] but the destruction that's coming to
[1:22:22] this earth
[1:22:23] there is nothing man
[1:22:25] has done or could do that's going to
[1:22:27] save them from it
[1:22:29] nothing
[1:22:30] the only safe place is in christ
[1:22:34] despite all their carnal preparations
[1:22:35] they will still be unprepared for what
[1:22:37] comes upon the earth
[1:22:39] there are those who in spite of all
[1:22:41] their worldly efforts are actually
[1:22:43] opposing themselves and they don't even
[1:22:45] know it
[1:22:47] objects of pity they are indeed
[1:22:50] amen now i want to go
[1:22:52] i won't finish that let's let's go over
[1:22:54] to genesis now
[1:22:58] genesis chapter 18.
[1:23:05] earthquakes in diverse places
[1:23:07] pestilence
[1:23:09] famines
[1:23:11] fearful sights
[1:23:14] things that government medicine science
[1:23:16] has no answer for the world has no
[1:23:19] answer for
[1:23:20] what is that that's perplexity
[1:23:23] they don't know how to fix it
[1:23:24] they don't know how to make it better
[1:23:27] that's their whole thing they they want
[1:23:28] to be able to explain everything they
[1:23:30] want to be able to put it in a little
[1:23:32] box and there's things that they just
[1:23:35] can't do it so they make excuses
[1:23:38] genesis chapter 18
[1:23:41] verse 16 let's read this
[1:23:44] this is a visitation of god and gabriel
[1:23:47] and michael brother brown said the three
[1:23:49] angels
[1:23:50] one was the lord jesus the lord god
[1:23:54] that came and visited abraham
[1:23:57] before the destruction of solo
[1:24:00] 16th verse
[1:24:03] genesis 18 16. and the men rose up from
[1:24:06] thence and looked towards sodom
[1:24:08] and abraham went with them to bring them
[1:24:11] on the way
[1:24:12] and the lord said and and
[1:24:15] the lord said shall i hide from abraham
[1:24:18] that thing which i do
[1:24:20] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[1:24:22] a great and mighty nation and all the
[1:24:25] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[1:24:28] him
[1:24:29] amen that includes us
[1:24:32] that includes the bride
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:36] the royal seat of abraham was jesus
[1:24:39] jesus we came from as our savior from
[1:24:42] the side of of christ came the bride
[1:24:46] so that's us he's talking about us
[1:24:48] amen amen and god is not going to let
[1:24:52] his son
[1:24:55] be ignorant to the things that he's
[1:24:57] about to do right amen
[1:25:00] amos says surely the lord god will do
[1:25:02] nothing except you reveal his secrets to
[1:25:04] this his servants the prophets that's
[1:25:06] why there had to be in this last day a
[1:25:09] seventh angel prophet messenger to come
[1:25:12] to bring the word so that we could see
[1:25:14] him in the word and unfold and reveal
[1:25:17] everything that he had intended to do
[1:25:19] through the scripture
[1:25:21] now this bride this last day he's gone
[1:25:24] on she was a part of he was a part is a
[1:25:26] part of that bride this brighter the
[1:25:28] last day now
[1:25:30] god
[1:25:31] must make her
[1:25:33] privy to those things that he's doing
[1:25:37] because he's not going to hide those
[1:25:39] things from his own
[1:25:41] so if there's something significant
[1:25:43] that's about to take place she's going
[1:25:45] to know it
[1:25:47] god's going to reveal it to her we don't
[1:25:49] know the day or the hour okay so don't
[1:25:51] get me wrong there i i never go against
[1:25:55] the scripture and say well the bride was
[1:25:56] she's gonna know the day or the hour no
[1:25:58] but i believe that she will know when
[1:26:00] that time arises
[1:26:02] and that that time that we're looking
[1:26:04] for of the season is here yeah yeah
[1:26:08] because you revealed it to abraham and
[1:26:10] abraham was his representative on the
[1:26:12] earth at that time well who's his
[1:26:14] representative on the earth now god
[1:26:17] always has representation on the earth
[1:26:19] you know that well who's his
[1:26:21] representation now it's the gentile
[1:26:23] bride
[1:26:24] we're at that representation of him on
[1:26:26] earth right now well he's not going to
[1:26:28] leave us in the dark morning he left
[1:26:30] abraham in the dark amen so we know
[1:26:34] and all the nations of the earth shall
[1:26:36] be blessed in him for i know him that he
[1:26:40] will command his children and his
[1:26:41] household after him and they shall keep
[1:26:44] the way of the lord to do justice and
[1:26:46] judgment
[1:26:47] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:26:49] that which he hath spoken of him and the
[1:26:51] lord said
[1:26:53] because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is
[1:26:56] great
[1:26:56] and because their sin is very grievous
[1:27:00] i will go down now and see whether they
[1:27:03] have done all together according to the
[1:27:05] cry of it which is come unto me and if
[1:27:08] not i will know
[1:27:10] now there's three of them
[1:27:12] we know the scripture tells us there's
[1:27:14] three of them
[1:27:15] where do these three come from
[1:27:18] well abraham had his tent pitched
[1:27:20] outside of sodom
[1:27:21] but as abraham had his tense
[1:27:24] tent pitch he was out there and he sees
[1:27:26] them coming towards him now the
[1:27:28] scripture does not
[1:27:30] describe in detail if you will how they
[1:27:34] came to him
[1:27:35] but he saw them coming
[1:27:38] and he ran to meet them and bowed down
[1:27:41] and said my lord
[1:27:44] which we know would signify that
[1:27:46] the one there was god
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:51] the other two angels
[1:27:53] they came for a purpose those three came
[1:27:56] for a purpose
[1:27:58] what was that purpose to visit abraham
[1:28:01] well god had already visited abraham
[1:28:04] amen but god had to make abraham aware
[1:28:07] of what he was about to do
[1:28:09] so he had to come by and when they got
[1:28:11] there abraham said oh come rest your
[1:28:14] feet set let's kill the fatted calves
[1:28:16] you can have milk and uh
[1:28:18] and and
[1:28:20] rest yourselves and eat and and abraham
[1:28:22] did that for them wash your feet
[1:28:26] and that was abraham's welcoming of them
[1:28:29] but that's not why they came
[1:28:32] they came for the purpose of the
[1:28:34] investigation of sodom and gomorrah
[1:28:36] look
[1:28:37] i will go down now and see whether they
[1:28:40] have done altogether together according
[1:28:42] to the cry which come to me and if not i
[1:28:44] will know
[1:28:45] what is that that is an investigation
[1:28:49] god said i will go
[1:28:52] did he go
[1:28:54] he stood there with abraham
[1:28:57] but who went
[1:28:58] his representatives
[1:29:01] the angels that came with him
[1:29:03] they went down to sodom but but god
[1:29:06] stayed back with with abraham and begin
[1:29:09] to talk to him
[1:29:11] while the other two went down to do the
[1:29:13] investigation
[1:29:15] but what was their purpose of coming
[1:29:18] their purpose of coming was to
[1:29:20] investigate what was going on in sodom
[1:29:22] to see whether it was what was reported
[1:29:25] or not now of course god always knows
[1:29:28] but he gives everybody every one of us a
[1:29:31] fair chance that's what justice is
[1:29:35] that's why god told
[1:29:36] abraham's lineage and family will
[1:29:39] continue to practice justice and
[1:29:42] judgment
[1:29:44] what is justice
[1:29:46] justice is saying okay i'm going to go
[1:29:48] and give them a fair chance
[1:29:51] and see whether it is that they are what
[1:29:53] they say they are or if they're going to
[1:29:54] repent or what's going to happen and he
[1:29:56] says i'm going to go check it out and
[1:29:59] investigate
[1:30:01] but they came by abraham because abraham
[1:30:05] was his representative on earth and he
[1:30:07] needed to let abraham know what he was
[1:30:08] about to do
[1:30:10] that's why he came by abraham
[1:30:13] to let abraham know this is what i'm
[1:30:15] going to do
[1:30:16] and when we go down there we'll know and
[1:30:19] god sent his investigative angels to go
[1:30:21] look
[1:30:22] and see is sodom what it says it is now
[1:30:25] when they left from abraham
[1:30:28] we have in our minds that these two
[1:30:30] angels just
[1:30:31] continue to just walk down to sodom just
[1:30:34] just like you're walking and just like
[1:30:36] you're on a hike
[1:30:38] well where you going going to sodom
[1:30:40] but we don't know how they went down
[1:30:42] there
[1:30:44] we don't we don't know how those angels
[1:30:46] ended up in sodom we don't know that
[1:30:49] we just know they went there
[1:30:52] how did they get there
[1:30:54] they were in
[1:30:55] they were in theophany corporal bodies
[1:30:57] sure because they ate and drank
[1:30:59] but we don't know they could have walked
[1:31:01] it
[1:31:02] but we don't know
[1:31:05] how did the angels come to brother
[1:31:06] branham
[1:31:08] right
[1:31:08] was he said that was he standing out
[1:31:11] there at sunset mountain running up the
[1:31:12] side of that hill and hear that
[1:31:14] explosion going there and then some
[1:31:16] angels coming walking over the hill
[1:31:20] no it didn't happen that way
[1:31:22] now see this we can get a description of
[1:31:25] we can get an understanding of how that
[1:31:28] happened because brother branham was
[1:31:29] there and he told us how it happened
[1:31:31] right
[1:31:33] they didn't come walking over the hill
[1:31:35] there was an explosion
[1:31:37] and all of a sudden those seven angels
[1:31:39] standing right in front of him in the
[1:31:40] shape of a pyramid
[1:31:42] just like that faster than that
[1:31:45] there they were
[1:31:47] there they were right in front of him
[1:31:49] explosion fam there they were
[1:31:51] how did these two angels get to sodom i
[1:31:53] don't know
[1:31:55] but they could have gone the exact same
[1:31:57] way that these angels came to brother
[1:31:58] brown
[1:31:59] they could have left the presence of god
[1:32:01] and abraham and finn and sodom just like
[1:32:03] that right
[1:32:04] these are supernatural beings friend see
[1:32:07] that's the one thing i've tried to
[1:32:09] explain to people who just can't get a
[1:32:11] grasp on the cloud right is it first of
[1:32:14] all don't let that have any bearing on
[1:32:16] your salvation because it doesn't
[1:32:18] on anybody's
[1:32:20] but you can't all these naysayers
[1:32:23] and critics they keep trying to put god
[1:32:27] and the supernatural in a box and you
[1:32:29] can't do that
[1:32:31] look friend i believe what what brother
[1:32:34] branham said was about that and i
[1:32:36] believe that that was supernatural that
[1:32:39] took place
[1:32:41] and people said well it was here then
[1:32:43] and it was here there and it had to go
[1:32:44] over here and it had to drift this way
[1:32:46] and it had to happen that way no it
[1:32:47] didn't it could have happened anyway god
[1:32:50] wanted it to happen right those seven
[1:32:53] could appear right now in this room if
[1:32:55] they wanted to right
[1:32:57] that clown could be right on the ceiling
[1:32:59] at this second if you wanted to
[1:33:01] it could be right over top of this
[1:33:02] building it could be out there when you
[1:33:04] go outside
[1:33:05] right
[1:33:07] and in and you know and in a blink of an
[1:33:10] eye
[1:33:11] they could be from outside this building
[1:33:13] to africa
[1:33:16] just like that
[1:33:17] because they're supernatural beings
[1:33:20] you can't put that in the box
[1:33:22] you can't just you can't just corral
[1:33:24] that down to say oh it's got to be this
[1:33:26] way and it's got to be that way no it
[1:33:27] doesn't
[1:33:28] it can be any way it wants to see well
[1:33:30] they got their picture taken in february
[1:33:32] and brother brandon wasn't down there
[1:33:34] doesn't matter
[1:33:37] they could be there then they could be
[1:33:39] there then they could be over there then
[1:33:40] they could have came from this direction
[1:33:42] they could have done this they could
[1:33:43] have done that
[1:33:44] because they're supernatural beings they
[1:33:46] could have been where the one at any
[1:33:47] time
[1:33:50] abraham begins to have a conversation
[1:33:51] with god well will you destroy it for
[1:33:53] this many would destroy it no
[1:33:55] it fears down to 10
[1:33:56] god said no i'll not destroy it if i
[1:33:58] find 10 did he find 10 no
[1:34:01] so it got destroyed
[1:34:03] but the point of the angels was the
[1:34:06] investigation
[1:34:08] now let's talk about the signs in the
[1:34:10] heavens for just a few minutes
[1:34:12] have you ever noticed
[1:34:14] at the increase of the activity in the
[1:34:16] heavens of all of these things that they
[1:34:18] don't know what they are
[1:34:21] they've dubbed them years ago ufos
[1:34:24] because they call them unidentified
[1:34:26] flying objects
[1:34:28] and they don't know what they are
[1:34:31] some people say well it's the government
[1:34:33] because they keep it a secret
[1:34:36] since when has the government been able
[1:34:37] to keep secrets
[1:34:40] the government can't keep secrets
[1:34:42] especially nowadays
[1:34:45] there's there's leakers on that this
[1:34:47] country is so divided and particle uh uh
[1:34:50] uh party partisan
[1:34:52] democrat liberals whatever
[1:34:55] they're so divided now all it takes is
[1:34:57] one and it leaks out and that's and
[1:34:59] everybody knows about it
[1:35:01] government can't keep a secret
[1:35:03] he said there's all kinds of things
[1:35:05] there probably are things that that we
[1:35:07] don't know won't ever know
[1:35:09] but people say oh they know what these
[1:35:11] things are they're in control of that
[1:35:12] but they won't tell anybody no you know
[1:35:14] why the government doesn't tell people
[1:35:16] about what ufos are because they don't
[1:35:18] know
[1:35:20] they don't know and they're embarrassed
[1:35:22] that they don't know because they're a
[1:35:24] bunch of prideful arrogant people who
[1:35:27] are supposed to be able to be so smart
[1:35:30] that they can explain everything and
[1:35:32] they have no idea
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:35] you don't hear about it from them
[1:35:37] because they just don't know
[1:35:40] the pentagon actually in the past month
[1:35:42] released a statement about these objects
[1:35:45] because they're becoming so prevalent
[1:35:47] now i don't know if they're more
[1:35:49] prevalent now i would say they are
[1:35:52] but i also say there's more video
[1:35:54] cameras around now than there used to be
[1:35:57] it used to be people say i saw so and so
[1:35:59] and they put you in a room about the
[1:36:01] size of our front room with a bunch of
[1:36:03] rubber on the walls
[1:36:05] you saw what yeah okay you come with me
[1:36:07] i got a nice room for you it's padded
[1:36:10] we'll give you some medicine and you'll
[1:36:11] be okay
[1:36:13] but now they've got phones and cameras
[1:36:15] everywhere
[1:36:16] you say oh no i didn't just say i saw it
[1:36:19] i took a picture of it i got a video of
[1:36:21] this thing screaming through the sky
[1:36:24] people say there's nothing on the planet
[1:36:26] that can go that fast or maneuver like
[1:36:28] that or even they've had some navy ships
[1:36:31] in san diego
[1:36:32] see these things dip beneath the ocean
[1:36:37] and shoot through the ocean at
[1:36:39] supersonic beyond supersonic speed and
[1:36:41] they have no answer for it
[1:36:44] they don't know
[1:36:46] there's still to them ufos because
[1:36:48] they're unidentified to those people
[1:36:50] they have no clue but they're so
[1:36:52] prideful they won't just come out and
[1:36:54] say look we don't know what this is
[1:36:57] we don't know if these are aliens we
[1:36:59] don't know if these are beings from
[1:37:02] other planets we don't know if this was
[1:37:04] a greater intelligence but i'm here to
[1:37:06] tell you this morning friend that we
[1:37:08] know
[1:37:08] yes
[1:37:10] we know what they are
[1:37:12] we know if these things are screaming
[1:37:14] through the sky because we had a prophet
[1:37:17] come and tell us what they were yeah and
[1:37:19] showed us in the scripture
[1:37:21] where they're identified amen
[1:37:24] investigating judgment angels
[1:37:28] are we at that time yeah
[1:37:30] if we're at that time then all that's
[1:37:33] going to begin to increase
[1:37:35] it's going to become more and more
[1:37:37] numerous
[1:37:38] and that's exactly it's become so
[1:37:40] numerous that uh certain uh
[1:37:43] media outlets are starting to pick it up
[1:37:45] even more now
[1:37:47] and people are starting to do special
[1:37:49] reports and investigations special
[1:37:51] investigations on these things that are
[1:37:53] dipping beneath the ocean and screaming
[1:37:56] navy planes
[1:37:58] on their radar picking these things
[1:38:00] screaming through the sky that they have
[1:38:01] no idea because their planes won't go
[1:38:03] that fast
[1:38:05] there's not a rocket that we built to go
[1:38:06] to the moon that won't go that fast
[1:38:09] and maneuver like that
[1:38:11] they can go across the sky faster than
[1:38:13] anything we've invented and stop just
[1:38:16] like that
[1:38:18] and hover
[1:38:21] move diagonally
[1:38:24] but we know what they are
[1:38:26] the world calls them ufos you know what
[1:38:28] i call them
[1:38:30] ifos
[1:38:32] because to me they're identified flying
[1:38:35] objects because they've been identified
[1:38:38] to the bride she knows what they are
[1:38:40] because she's had a prophet come and
[1:38:42] tell her what they are
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:48] i've got some quotes i might skip some
[1:38:50] of it because it's it's
[1:38:52] 12 it's time to close
[1:38:55] he said did you notice the angels that
[1:38:57] came down and investigated sodom before
[1:38:59] sodom was destroyed do you remember that
[1:39:02] there's a three of them that came down
[1:39:04] stayed with abraham there were lights
[1:39:06] brother adam said there were lights from
[1:39:08] heaven that came down in the
[1:39:10] investigating judgment
[1:39:14] look uh look where they're found around
[1:39:17] the pentagon all these things they
[1:39:18] follow the world's judgment
[1:39:21] sodom
[1:39:22] there is one representative will be
[1:39:24] represented among the churches will be
[1:39:25] christ himself vindicating himself
[1:39:28] sights in the heavens
[1:39:31] above the signs the earth beneath
[1:39:34] certainly
[1:39:36] that's exactly what's happening right
[1:39:37] now
[1:39:39] he talks he tells about junior jackson's
[1:39:42] dream
[1:39:43] that junior had
[1:39:45] about seeing brother bannon when he came
[1:39:47] out west
[1:39:49] and he and he said he saw it he looked
[1:39:51] back east and he saw this look like a
[1:39:53] little spot he called it that looked
[1:39:56] like a flying saucer
[1:39:58] that was shooting towards brother
[1:39:59] branham
[1:40:00] that's the way he identified it
[1:40:04] see the world don't know what that
[1:40:06] you is
[1:40:06] you know it's on we know what it is we
[1:40:10] know it's investigating judgment angels
[1:40:13] see they don't realize what it is see
[1:40:15] let me uh let them think whatever they
[1:40:17] want to they call them flying sausage or
[1:40:20] whatever but that's because they don't
[1:40:22] know
[1:40:24] they don't know what it is
[1:40:26] my
[1:40:27] he talks about the example he had in
[1:40:29] sunset mountain let me read you a couple
[1:40:31] here i'm going to close
[1:40:34] he said in christ revealing his own word
[1:40:39] we could have uh we could not get any
[1:40:41] continuity amongst medics among
[1:40:43] scientists different ones if einstein he
[1:40:46] said had only had had the spiritual
[1:40:49] application
[1:40:50] to the physical application as he
[1:40:52] studied the laws of light and so forth
[1:40:54] he could have told us something but of
[1:40:56] course we know einstein didn't have a
[1:40:58] spiritual application
[1:41:00] thank god we know one who did
[1:41:02] when we hear his message on the great
[1:41:04] center somewhere in the skies
[1:41:06] ever contacted with that center you
[1:41:08] could create earth
[1:41:10] do anything and the power would be
[1:41:12] unlimited
[1:41:14] you see these little pockets going
[1:41:16] through the air they call them saucers
[1:41:17] so forth
[1:41:19] well
[1:41:20] he said i said i better leave that alone
[1:41:22] here all these people come up missing
[1:41:25] don't hear from them they're standing
[1:41:26] here and then they're not there that's
[1:41:28] the way the rapture is going to be
[1:41:30] one of them will rot drop right down and
[1:41:33] this terrestrial body will take on a
[1:41:35] celestial body and there won't be hide
[1:41:38] here bone left
[1:41:40] the rapture
[1:41:42] it'll be transformed in a moment of time
[1:41:46] dropping right out of space and taking
[1:41:48] home taking us home
[1:41:52] we see what's going on now but they
[1:41:54] don't know what it is little children
[1:41:56] listen
[1:41:57] it's going to pick you up one of these
[1:41:59] days don't worry
[1:42:01] amen he's going to pick you up one of
[1:42:03] these days
[1:42:05] i'm looking forward to that day friend
[1:42:06] amen amen he says we're living in the
[1:42:08] shadows of his coming and those shadows
[1:42:10] are becoming more positive year by year
[1:42:13] we see the signs appearing fearful
[1:42:15] sights we see in newspapers magazines
[1:42:18] moon turning to blood they even had a
[1:42:20] movie about the blood moons
[1:42:22] uh
[1:42:23] that uh
[1:42:25] preacher whatever his name is hey no it
[1:42:28] was a haiti i had the blood moons oh
[1:42:30] they can have them but they can have uh
[1:42:33] uh movies about blood moons but they
[1:42:34] have no idea what it is
[1:42:36] they got no revelation about it i went
[1:42:38] and watched it one time with some
[1:42:39] brothers in the theater i saw the blood
[1:42:41] moon movie and it meant it made
[1:42:43] absolutely no sense
[1:42:45] it didn't
[1:42:46] it wasn't scriptural
[1:42:48] it was just something to try to get
[1:42:50] people to say oh this blood moon and
[1:42:52] there's going to be signs in the heavens
[1:42:53] blood but what does that mean
[1:42:55] what's the point what's the purpose
[1:42:57] and he had no clue
[1:42:59] there's no revelation there friends see
[1:43:03] fearful sights we see the newspapers
[1:43:05] about the moon turning to blood we hear
[1:43:07] of earthquakes all around the world
[1:43:08] blasting the whole world
[1:43:11] amen
[1:43:12] he talked about finding the earthquake
[1:43:14] that shook the time of jesus
[1:43:16] and history repeating itself to be the
[1:43:18] same way
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:20] things will be taking place like we see
[1:43:22] them today and people and the world
[1:43:24] doesn't know what they are they don't
[1:43:26] know how to explain them
[1:43:28] i had somebody ask me here what about
[1:43:30] those flying saucers the ufos and things
[1:43:33] and you see them all the time now and
[1:43:34] they're all over the news and people
[1:43:36] have pictures of them in videos what is
[1:43:38] it that's going on up there
[1:43:40] sights in the heaven
[1:43:42] fearful to those who don't know
[1:43:45] it's a blessing to those who do know
[1:43:47] right because we know what they are
[1:43:48] right we know their purpose being here
[1:43:51] we know what they're accomplishing and
[1:43:53] we know that that one of them's going to
[1:43:55] drop down and pick us up one of these
[1:43:56] days
[1:43:57] amen
[1:43:58] praise the lord
[1:44:00] i i saw
[1:44:02] a movie one time that brother john hall
[1:44:05] recommended i'm trying to remember the
[1:44:06] name of it
[1:44:09] uh
[1:44:10] but but it was it was like about
[1:44:12] supernatural things
[1:44:13] and prophecy
[1:44:15] and uh and at the end these kids these
[1:44:18] two little kids running towards the tree
[1:44:20] of life and and these look like space
[1:44:22] rockets coming off the earth like this
[1:44:24] and one of them picked those kids up and
[1:44:26] took them away i thought my this my this
[1:44:29] person might have a bit more revelation
[1:44:30] than what we think
[1:44:32] amen
[1:44:33] but
[1:44:34] i believe
[1:44:35] not the movie but i believe what the
[1:44:38] prophet told us and and and matches with
[1:44:40] the scripture
[1:44:42] amen that's the main thing matches with
[1:44:44] the scripture so what day are we living
[1:44:47] what time is it friend where are we at
[1:44:49] is it rapture time
[1:44:51] i believe it's rapture time frame
[1:44:53] amen those investigating judgment angels
[1:44:56] are becoming more more prevalent all
[1:44:58] around us those ufos to the bride or
[1:45:01] ifos because we know exactly what they
[1:45:03] are
[1:45:03] amen
[1:45:04] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:45:14] amen
[1:45:17] can i add something
[1:45:19] god revealing himself
[1:45:27] a video
[1:45:29] of what you were talking about
[1:45:32] and these are inter-dimensional beings
[1:45:34] you could see them come into our
[1:45:36] dimension they would just all of a
[1:45:37] sudden appear and you can also see them
[1:45:40] go to the spot and then disappear they
[1:45:42] were coming in and out of our dimension
[1:45:43] you could see it
[1:45:45] and there were these these lights
[1:45:47] and then they'd zip around and then they
[1:45:49] would disappear
[1:45:51] in that spot and then they would and
[1:45:53] then another one would just
[1:45:55] up here and then
[1:45:56] zip around
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:03] amen
[1:46:04] we know what they are praise the lord
[1:46:07] thankful
[1:46:08] to know
[1:46:10] it's like
[1:46:12] when we were talking about the cobot and
[1:46:14] the vaccination
[1:46:16] and the thing that's going on around the
[1:46:17] world today that the vaccination is the
[1:46:19] mark of the beast
[1:46:21] you know without this message and
[1:46:23] without the truth of the word revealed
[1:46:25] word for the day and a vindicated
[1:46:27] prophet we would never know that right
[1:46:30] you could i appreciate brother dennis
[1:46:32] pointing that out how prevalent
[1:46:34] uh and how important it is to understand
[1:46:36] that what we are privy to in this
[1:46:39] message and what we know
[1:46:40] and i can look at that and i say oh no
[1:46:42] that's not the mark of the beast because
[1:46:44] i know it's not the mark of the beast
[1:46:45] but the importance of why and how we
[1:46:48] know that
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:50] is the importance of how and why we know
[1:46:52] what we know about these other things
[1:46:54] that's going on around the world today
[1:46:56] the the ufos and all this we know that
[1:46:58] because because we believe a message
[1:47:01] that's right amen we know that message

[1:54:46] you streaming if you're still there
[1:54:48] brother newton
[1:54:50] um i heard that
[1:54:53] um
[1:54:54] there is some christians that converted
[1:54:57] you know from islam
[1:54:58] and
[1:55:00] we're at right now
[1:55:10] and the united states
[1:55:13] is fighting them coming here
[1:55:17] so the man
[1:55:18] i don't know if you know who glenn beck
[1:55:20] is
[1:55:21] he's
[1:55:22] raised money and
[1:55:24] getting them out of there yeah but he'd
[1:55:27] have to
[1:55:28] that's hard to do there's only one way
[1:55:30] out of there and that's cabal airport
[1:55:32] and cabal is completely guarded by the
[1:55:34] taliban well he was able to get
[1:55:37] two thousand christians wow
[1:55:39] so we just practiced his heart that god
[1:55:41] will get
[1:55:43] his children that's a tough one yeah
[1:55:46] yeah that's why i was saying that i i'd
[1:55:48] heard the taliban's going around
[1:55:50] i i don't i don't know and i'm not going
[1:55:52] to accuse the
[1:55:54] united states of
[1:55:56] yeah i shouldn't have said that making
[1:55:58] those people stay there but
[1:56:00] but i do know that they're doing very
[1:56:03] little to help them get out
[1:56:06] they're like uh you know we know so and
[1:56:08] so well get them to the airport we'll
[1:56:10] get them home
[1:56:13] i'm sorry i can't hop in my car and
[1:56:15] drive down to t.i.a and go take a flight
[1:56:18] it doesn't work that way in afghanistan
[1:56:21] and cabal and
[1:56:23] governed by the taliban it doesn't work
[1:56:25] that way
[1:56:26] but anyway
[1:56:27] i know they're not making it even easier
[1:56:31] so god bless his heart for trying to
[1:56:33] help rescue those people because that's
[1:56:35] yes just pray for them it is
[1:56:38] it is a horrible
[1:56:42] i'm sorry i'll close we have
[1:56:45] um
[1:56:46] a very divided country politically
[1:56:49] um
[1:56:50] i have my views most of my views are
[1:56:53] based on the fact that one party
[1:56:55] believes in abortion and the other
[1:56:56] doesn't that's that's my biggest thing
[1:56:59] but um we're killing babies let's put it
[1:57:01] that way
[1:57:02] see
[1:57:04] a beautiful smile see what can you
[1:57:05] imagine if
[1:57:07] how people somebody can kill that
[1:57:09] beautiful baby anyway that's my view but
[1:57:13] but there's actually a a
[1:57:16] general consensus among both sides
[1:57:18] they're actually starting to agree now
[1:57:21] that this whole afghanistan thing was a
[1:57:24] disaster
[1:57:25] a horrible horrible disaster so anyway
[1:57:29] um
[1:57:30] yes please
[1:57:31] let's continue to pray for them and
[1:57:34] god bless this man's heart for trying to
[1:57:36] help people get out christians and
[1:57:38] because i like i said i did hear they're
[1:57:40] going door-to-door knocking on doors and
[1:57:42] checking phones for bible apps and stuff
[1:57:44] like that so and they'll and they'll
[1:57:46] kill them on the spot no i mean they
[1:57:49] they have no
[1:57:51] the the girls and women will be sex
[1:57:53] slaves and they'll kill the men and
[1:57:55] uh yeah it is a ruthless horrible
[1:57:59] ungodly
[1:58:00] scenario that is unfolding and is going
[1:58:03] to just get worse if the if if and when
[1:58:05] we do leave for good
[1:58:07] which is supposed to be in three days
[1:58:10] so anyway
[1:58:11] uh it's just sad i hate to keep talking
[1:58:14] about it but it's really been sad to me
[1:58:16] i've seen some of the videos and stuff
[1:58:21] did you say that he's getting people out
[1:58:24] other ways other than cabal aircraft i
[1:58:27] don't know how he's doing it but he
[1:58:29] could be getting him to other countries
[1:58:30] since america won't take him well we'll
[1:58:32] talk about that later well the reason
[1:58:34] i'm saying well i'm not going to
[1:58:36] ask if you could send the link to pastor
[1:58:40] so pastor can send it to everybody else
[1:58:43] so they can do their research and if
[1:58:44] they want to donate to this
[1:58:47] to this cause
[1:58:48] to get the people out if you can't give
[1:58:50] america can't get them out the airport
[1:58:52] can't get them out then this then this
[1:58:54] man
[1:58:56] heard that he was getting them out other
[1:58:58] ways out of the country other ways and
[1:59:00] uh
[1:59:01] okay
[1:59:03] amen i just hope i pray that's true so
[1:59:06] um and i believe it is because i know
[1:59:08] who you're talking about and
[1:59:09] uh
[1:59:12] so god richly bless you appreciate you
[1:59:14] coming i mean
[1:59:17] we're at the end this this is the end
[1:59:19] time it's later than we think yeah and i
[1:59:22] believe just any moment in time

[1:59:28] sincerest gratitudes and thanks to the
