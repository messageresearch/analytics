than we normally are so let's stand to our feet if we could and then we trust in the Lord's hand upon each need and every request he's mindful of them amen I believe in faith you know one of the greatest tries that uh or or probably the greatest fry that Martin Luther had is the judge shall live by faith amen and faith alone praise the Lord brother Dennis would you take these to these Lord Jesus we bow knowing that we're coming before you uh caring and loving God yes mindful of all our needs and help us first of all to get ourselves out of the way that as we approach you Lord there'll be no sin that there to sin our hearts that you'll wash us and cleanse Us by your blood yes Lord if the prophet said there's one provided place of of worship a place that you meet us every day is under your shed blood fathers and Lord may we come boldly there are a lot of needs that's been expressed this morning uh different ones that need a healing touch yes you remember all of them and you're Mindful and you're caring for each and every one that needs a healing touch yes and father you love each and every one of us and Lord we call you on to see to minister to each one that's not feeling good for thou and a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed yes it's the finished work you have accomplished already as Calvary and father we claim each portion to each one that the testimonies will come forth that you truly are yes [Music] a great physician oh Lord we are trusting in you in everything there's a fight that's going on harder than ever before and father I'm recognizing it more and more it has to be you to have that yes preeminence to have control in our own selves the best we can we'll miss it by a million miles even the best life we can live thinking that that we're doing good he we know that your work teaches us to trust in you father yes he just think it's when he stands take heed lest he fall and Lord you have given us a word a message they'll get us ready for a Rapture yes if the lights are shining brighter than ever before Oh Lord help us to recognize just stay with your word as your Prophet after you gave him the revelation of the seals he did continue to preach the Deep things of your word he pointers to get back to the word to love one another to to um eternal life as he taught us with living for one another and large to we know as the second Timothy Paul said Fearless times will come where people will be unthankful and holy without natural affection and so forth and Lord that's even getting among your people help us to die to the flesh Die daily to get out of the way that your life will be fully manifested in us that we can be a Billboards for you written yes is our pastor already said use our brother Noel to speak to our hearts May our hearts be open to receive your word this morning we want to be better Christians better prepared never lose our enthusiasm for your coming for father you could come today you could come 10 years but father we always want to be ready [Music] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Lord you can be seated if you'd like amen one more we got um in the in the Burgundy book if you want to look in the books I'm like confirmative book we'll have it on the um we'll have it on the screen here one more Valley one more Hill I don't know if any of you know this song we'll sing it quite a bit North Carolina and ran across it here I was looking at songs the other day and it's popped out to me the Lord put on my heart to try to sing today so [Music] finally pay for a note if you're looking in the book there it's 97 in the Burgundy book and again we'll have it here on the screen one more Valley one more heel I mean he believes that man almost home praise the Lord amen let's sing it to him [Music] and the waves cover me and the Lord clouds won't let the sun shine through then a boy seems to say each other be a brighter day don't allow the storm to hide sweet Heavens fear cause you've got more and more Valley one more year and you've got one more trial One More Tears [Music] maybe one more mile to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home don't let Satan see your tears learn to smile through all your fears hold your head up high and give the world a smile just be faithful all the way it will be worth it all someday for we'll all will be over after a while because you've got one more Valley one more here and you've got one more trial one more [Music] curve in life's strong maybe one more month to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get all let's sing it again foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Valley one more heal one more trial one more tear the Lord knows it all praise the Lord that we're here at this time at the end amen and thankful praise the Lord you see things happening in this world today friends it just it used to be that you mentioned it when you're ministering you prayed about it you thought about it but nowadays things are happening so to the point that an alert unless the Lord just gives you words I don't know what to say anymore right I I just I'm out of words as a preacher and that's pretty detrimental when the preacher runs out of words I don't know what to say about the things going on in this world today it's just absolutely incredible what's had I saw this morning an article of kids are going into grocery stores now dumping all the milk out on the floor yeah I put them in jail you put them in jail for a while they'll quit doing that stuff yeah but they just don't it I I don't know I don't know what else to say Amen but the Lord's in charge yeah he's in control amen and I believe that we're at this time I'm ready to go home and whenever whenever he calls us we're ready to go home praise the Lord so again we're very happy to have brother Noel Johnson with us today and looking forward to what he has to speak to us trust the Lord just Minister through him to our hearts amen whatever that might be so let's stand to our feet one more time amen praise the Lord would sing brother Green's old song for he is Lord his brother Noel comes today [Music] every knee shall bow every time [Music] Jesus Christ I want a great wall in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ again it's my privileges to be with you this morning amen you take your Bibles open them to Genesis the second chapter read just two verses there you know we believe we're at the end time it's not coming it's actually here yes there's something that God is trying to do in our lives to prepare us for that we're just coming and so the sermon like a pilot returning back to Eden and hopefully that'll make more sense when we get into it Genesis the second chapter starting in verse 16. and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for the day thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die yes and let's just pray our most gracious and loving Heavenly Father it is again our privilege to gather ourselves together around your word and to sit at your feet and receive what you have for us yes Jesus yes for things you've impressed upon me Lord and things you've been showing me in the word yes Lord and Lord with your assistance with your with your permission Lord I would like for you to express to the people that which you've been showing me yes yes or Lord I believe it'll help us all on the hour in which we're living yes to be able to realize there's coming a day when it's days soon our bodies will be changed and all of a sudden we'll hear the marriage supper amen and then after that Lord we're going to come back and Rule and reign with you you'll be with me this morning take control of this vessel and use it for your honor and your glory by asking Jesus Christ's name amen amen you seated you know it's interesting that when God began to give a commandment to to Adam and Eve he said in a tree of the knobs are good and evil thou shall not eat it for the day thou eat us thereof Thou shalt surely die when God had taken Adam and Eve and placed him in the garden they had I mean the Fellowship they had was unhindered Adam could look into the Realms above him he could see the angels He could see God he could see the throne he could see everything there was to see that Dimension was not that Dimension was open unto him because Satan is the prince of the power of the air He has blocked that that's why we can't see right but I noticed listening to what brother Branham has often says he says you know there's angels all around us yes he sees up he can see that right when he prayed for somebody he said oh he's he's into God deserving he says you you you have this oh and you you have the same thing they have they're crying out for help yes I reviewed both of you in the name of Jesus Christ and they would go amen so he could see into a realm that for the most for most of us we we just don't enter into that realm but yet that realm still affects us yes that realm really it's guiding it's controlling what is going on in the world Satan's Eden he controls it all um okay but we're not part of Satan's Eden right amen we are different we are God's children and it's God is trying to take his children and he's trying to make us aware of just who we are trying to make us aware that we're not part of this world we're not part of Satan's Aiden no we are Sons and Daughters of God that have been fully restored to our rightful position with our father amen amen the more we can begin to recognize that and recognize brother Madam in one place it says when the bride realizes who she is and what she possesses she'll do the Greater Works when we begin to understand that we are Sons and Daughters of God we are the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ amen and Jesus Christ blood was God's blood so we are the purchase of God's own blood and so he we are we are God we are God's possession we are God's children and Satan has no rights to us amen we are no longer part of this world right we are a different creation of which Satan should have no part but we have to withstand him you know brother random when he hit when he was growing up he was a prize fighter right a price fighter when they get in the ring he says now you hit me real gentle and and I want her to hit you very hard either we'll get through this no they're looking for The Knockout puns they're looking for one way to lay that guy out flat right well when Satan gets six of his ugly head hit him in the head given everything you got yeah lay him out flat let him know I am not going to tolerate you you don't have any possession with me you have no part with me make your bags pack them get out of here amen because that is our rights yes that is our right as a son and daughter of God yes sir and what is God God is not just some wimpy little thing oh I wonder if they're going to survive today I wonder if they're gonna when I want all these poor people I wonder if they're going to be able to make it through tomorrow no my God's an awesome God Amen I mean there's nothing he can't do by a spoken word the universe came into manifestation yes sir everything is subject to him that's Satan and all of us demons we can access our father and we can tell our father this guy is bothering me yes just you know I only need 10 000 Angels come on just just clean them off you know but we have access to everything Heaven is yeah amen but we have to be willing to access it yes in Christ the ministry of God revealed brother Brown says it's a revelation it says Eternal as God's word is eternal look but but the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to re to redeem and restore Eve the original condition in the Garden of Eden right so what is the whole purpose of Salvation what is the whole purpose of the Plan of Redemption to get us back to Eden Amen to get us back to that relationship to get us back to the position where really we there is no sin to our church we'll be in glorified bodies yes yes you know when we think about the body that you see is not me amen there's a theophany that was a part of God from the beginning yes that's who I am the only problem I have is that's the offering still trying to take this flesh and and tell it no this is not you no you're something higher than what you precede and so what you need to do is get in touch with your theophany so to speak and be able to enter into a realm in which it lives and be able to have the faith in God because God is through that theophany is working on officer or something in that nature but we have to begin to believe who we are amen and until you can accept the fact that you're a son and daughter of God I mean really accept the fact that you are a manifestation of God himself yes until you can accept that fact Satan Satan will win amen but it but when you begin to accept that fact and then Satan sticks up his ugly head as they Satan I suggest you leave right now otherwise you're going to get bloodied because I'm going to beat you to a pole yes and how do we beat him we do it with the word right when Satan attempted Jesus Christ what did he do Satan says oh it's written and Jesus says yeah but it's also written amen he always took him back to the word because brother Brown says the word of God will defeat Satan any time anywhere under any circumstance yes but you have to believe that word and you have to believe that God will honor that word amen you have to have faith in God faith is not believing for something faith is believing in someone amen do you believe in someone and you believe that someone has the ability to heal you believe that someone has the ability to create you believe that that being you can do anything and everything and if you have that kind of faith in that being then all you do is go to him and says father because he is our father father I have a need today amen and just laid out before him amen and then it's not begging no we are not Beggars right I am God's son amen I do not have to beg for what he's already trying to give me yes it's like when when uh we're at youth camps that I was at a few years back um God showed me something all right because we'd have the minister would get up there he prayed something you know make an altar call him yeah you know everybody come forward we'd pray for this one pray for that one then the next Sun the next evening what we'd have another service and they always went ahead everybody that came back the first night was there a second time so he prayed for them third night was the same I said Lord I don't understand what's going on here and so some thoughts came in my mind and he says you know it's like a woman she's out there and she's going through the village and she's begging for this and she's all dirty and her hair's all messed up and she's she hasn't eaten her decent meal in weeks and she's going can I just have a little piece of bread please use a little piece of bread I'm just so I would do just a little barcel of bread just so I can survive and should we go to this one and this one and this one and finally she says you know there's a good man on the hill oh I'm sure he'll I'm sure he'll be he'll be kind to me I'm sure he'll go ahead and he'll give me just just a little more celebration I'm so hungry so she goes up when she knocks on the door the gentleman of the house opens the door looks at her and she begins to beg he looks at her and says sweetheart what are you out here begging for you're my wife oh look at your hair's all messed up and your clothes are so dirty yeah because we have you caught with the the you know the there's a shower there's a bath you know washing by the water of the word amen and we have we've had we've had this the banquet spread out for you yes just waiting for you to come home amen just go down after you've got yourself clean why don't you go in the banquet room and just feed yourself you don't have to beg right you are his wife amen yes how many men have your wife been crawling our hands and knees and you know hobby would you give me just a little bit of something and I haven't eaten for two days now I just would like a little bit of something that's in the fridge now yeah right I mean she's basically the one who goes in the fridge and serves you you know but I mean but but here again this is the point amen it's not a matter of begging right it's a matter of accepting what he's already given to you yes and you can go and you can eat freely amen why did God why do we have the message on tape or on CD or whatever we media you to use now yeah that is God trying to feed the bride and let this is who you are amen you are not someone with you little person no you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are his you are his wife you are the one he loved from the beginning of creation Hallelujah and he wants to feed you he wants to encourage him he wants you to overcome the things of this world because only by over and you can only overcome through him yes amen you're not going to do it in yourself amen no you have to rely upon him like Jesus himself you know Satan says you're hungry you haven't eaten for 40 days take this sounds make him into bread Jesus so you don't live by bread alone amen by every word of God Amen if God had told him to sure he could have sure you know I mean here again what do you do you go back to the word because only through the word can you defeat Satan amen we say oh we believe God heals and he does but until you make that personal to yourself no God your word says you have healed me and once you read once once you make that promise um to where God is promising you then all of a sudden now there's an obligation yeah but then once you want to remind him of his obligation then you thank him yes as I hear again going back to the Youth Camp there was a young lady and she was crying and crying and crying and in front of the minister just went over to her sister what are you wanting oh I won I freaking don't know what it was he said sister start thanking him yes don't beg start thanking him amen amen so she started thanking God for what she was seeking for and a few minutes later all of a sudden she just had her hands raised up and she was running the aisles because now God was wanting to give it to her but she was not willing to accept it right but once you're willing to accept that all of us are okay that changes the whole picture amen yes we know that God in the beginning it says the Bible says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth that's in Genesis 1 1 right but you go into John the first chapter now and we begin to find out in what form God was in when he began the process of creation so in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was done anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men amen so God is a spirit nobody can see a spirit we can feel a spirit we can we can sense his presence but yet just to see it to see a spirit as a physical being is not an option because they don't have physical manifestations if you will right so God had to create himself in a physical form where he can sit there and he could create a universe where God can come and he could express himself to his family because then God was a family yes and he wanted to have anyone to fellowship with his family amen but he can't fellowship with him in spirit no they had they had to take on bodies that's why it says in the beginning God had the logos in the beginning was the thought of in God's mind and this thought was with God in the beginning and this and this thought finally came into manifestation in a theophany form amen but so you have to realize we were in that theophany when that's the often it was formed yes amen all of God's children was in that theophany when that's the often it came into manifestation right and then from that point on God was wanting to take and have that which was in that's the often he wanted to come into manifestation so God could fellowship with his children yes praise the Lord because he could not fellowship with Amen in any other form yeah well this is what we are we are an expression of God we are a manifestation of a thought of God from the beginning yeah in numerous in numerous places because it goes on in Genesis in in Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air and the cattle and over everything the creepers upon the Earth amen so God created a man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so when Adam was first formed that's the officer with that within that theophany there was him and his wife amen okay and God blessed them but they were in theophany form at that point and goes on in Genesis 2 and God formed and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils a breath of life and Man became a living Soul yes so that's the oxanae which is our soul now all of a sudden Gammon dwelt in the human flesh amen and in that human flesh God had to put him in human flesh because he was supposed to he was supposed to rule the Earth but he could not he could not experience what the animals were experiencing until he was made flesh right amen God could not experience Humanity until he experienced it in Jesus Christ amen that's why he had to come in human flesh that's why he had to become our Kinsmen Redeemer he didn't have to experience everything we experienced from it being a baby being a totally helpless individual yes where his mother had to feed him mother had to clothe the mother had to bathe him mother had to correct him mother had to teach them how to walk mother had to teach them how to talk mother had to teach them all of these different things yes he but he was God Amen when he came into manifestation he was God yes but he had to experience everything we experienced right amen the Bible says he and he was tempted in all the ways that we are tempted yes but he never sinned right he never doubted God Amen because brother Brown says sin is unbelievable right so he always in in that when he actually knew what the purpose for his coming into manifestation when did he do he know that we don't know but as a child he had to grow up and he had to learn different things but see there was a nature in him that was a manifestation of his father yes I am I am an expression of my death amen because because a lot of the a lot of my Expressions the same as my dad had because I came from him right okay and each of you you there are certain traits that you have there are certain things that you do and say oh yeah you know your mama just your mom acted just the same way your mama smiled just the same way you smile or your dad had this this kind of a a mannerism or something and you know it's just like your daddy did right because that's part of you so in Jesus Christ when he was when he was formed when he came even as a baby the only nature that dwelt in him was that of God Amen and so all of the attributes of God oh God he what he what did he Express the only thing he could express as a child was that of the nature of the god that dwelt in him amen and so he never doubted his father he never doubted God right he never sinned but everybody hit here again but yeah did Mommy have to correct him sure because he had to learn to conform to the society as Society was in his day sure we have to we have to conform to society our society as it is in these days amen we can't get on the freeway and do 90 miles an hour there's a law against that because I think there still is here yeah um but you know I mean there are certain there's certain restrictions that we do have and so we conform to our the laws of the land simply because we don't want we don't want to offend if you will but you know it's interesting when God had taken Adam and Eve place them in the garden there's only one stipulation God had given to Adam don't go to knowledge don't rely on knowledge right amen rely upon me I am your father I will guide you I will direct you I reveal things unto you don't go to knowledge because knowledge reasons yes Faith merely accepts amen and this is what we're going back to we're going back to a condition where really we don't look at knowledge we don't look at how we feel we don't look at how the things going on around it no we sit there and we enter into a realm with God in which faith in which Faith controls are all our every action amen and so like I said do I do I yeah there are days I don't feel good so God's healed me all right so why should I accept it amen you know brother Brown says you know every man has faith yeah you give it to you can take you can take your faith and give it to Satan except what Satan's trying to give you or you can take that same faith and give it to God and rely upon God's promise amen so which one every whoever you give it to that's what you can expect I mean Satan doesn't give up easy not you don't feel good fine I mean there are days I haven't felt good so what do I do my body tells me if you really want to overcome go to bed get some rest drink plenty of fluids okay and the following day or two you'll be fine because the body is telling you I have to have time to heal yeah right I have to have time to repair myself amen so if I give it a chance to do that it'll do that yes if I ignore that when my body is trying to tell me then okay it'll whenever you're sick and you think oh now I'm feeling great today and you go out and you ignore that yeah then the relapse is generally worse than the original amen So Yesterday may take two days to overcome now you now it's a week okay because the body God has made it to heal itself right yes you have to give it a chance so I I'm not negating that but still God has already healed me amen and God has already healed me then I should be able to enjoy that I should be able to I should be able to allow my body to repair itself because it will yes if I if if I would give it the chance amen brother Brandon questions and answers he says and he walked through the Garden of Eden first as a theophany like the holy spirit is here now walking here now it led animal life it controlled everything but it couldn't kill the soil sorry see so God put him in flesh so that he could till the soil and gave him his five senses to chill the soil and to fix up The Vineyards and so forth and then the man and and then the man still looked Lonesome oh this is he said brother this is a beautiful picture look for when he for for when he was first made he was made two people together he was made both male and female the man was the Bible said that right God made God made man both male and female created he he him see now when the man was separated from the theophany and put in flesh he wasn't just all together there part of his being was still in theophany see um but about Adam see he see there was something lacking and that very crave showed that there was a mate waiting for him you get that in the very thoughts that we have here the very thoughts that we have to die here that were troubled and perplexed we longed for a life that has no death but the thing that struck me there he says he says Adam when he was created he was male and female right often he formed amen and then God took that the offering Place Adam the Adam part of that in a temple of clay but he said there was something missing because there was a part of Adam still in theophany for yes well when God created that theophany within that theophany was male and female and so what until Jesus Christ has his bride he's not complete either amen we are the other half of him amen and when you start looking at the godhead when brother Ram says oh that God was the important to Christ in Christ he pour in the church he said don't see the Oneness of the godhead amen don't you realize you are a part of Jesus Christ from the very beginning yes if you are part of Jesus Christ from the very beginning that elevates you to the place where you're part of God praise the Lord amen I haven't been able to fully comprehend that to realize that I am that that I am an ex I am an expression of God that is true but to take the next step up above that and say yeah I all that God is I you know I can express I mean I cannot die for somebody's sins that I mean obviously there are limitations that I have in my flesh but where we're going back to an Eden there will be no hindrance anymore it would be like Adam was in the garden Adam was a Son of God and as a Son of God he controlled nature yes Jesus Christ when he was on this he was on on the Sea of Galilee he was heated he was tired he wouldn't lay down the boat his body needed rest because it was physical yeah and all of a sudden the disciples came and woke him up don't you carry the repairs don't you see the storm around us they're both showing up with light and we're all gonna die he just look around says peace amen be still yeah he didn't scream and shout stand up and phone with him out amen he didn't have to he knew who he was yes amen be still brother Brandon when all of a sudden God still go back up through the mountain Brothers obviously God's going to take me home because nobody can survive this blizzard that's going on you know I guess in Colorado where it was yeah and uh and God spoke to him and speak to the storm whatever you say that's exactly what it'll be yes sir well so he he didn't jump up and down and scream and shout he said no he says dorm cease son you come out and Shine for the next however many days it was yeah until we finished our hunting triple and then you can come back and you can have your snowstorm again but as soon as the words went out of his mouth the storm stopped amen and the sun came out right why could he do that God gave him the permission to say I mean that's when we get down to the spoken word brother Ramsey because brother somebody asked brother Brown does everybody have the have the spoken word can everybody speaks the word brother and said well yeah it relies in everybody but he says whenever the spoken word expressed itself through me he says it was an unction from God yes right God instructed God gave permission amen well when when we come to the place in our relationship with God where God can speak to us and give us the words to say yeah yes yeah then it'll happen amen because it's no longer us speaking but it's God speaking through US yes right right I don't know if I related about the timing we were in in Israel and in India and this lady she um anyway this guy told her to fast for 40 days and 49th I relate that here okay but so what happened was all of a sudden looking at the situation and all of a sudden Works came into my mind look don't don't look at the stupidity of the ACT but look at that sincerity of a pardon yeah that may not be the spoken word but I don't see why I couldn't look at it that way certainly I mean it wasn't me I mean I was I was a mess amen but here again God needed an instrument to speak his word and he just used me for that yes right amen amen questions and answers in Hebrews brother Branham says and Adam was lonesome and God should show that that they could not be separated now I'm going to get back to the same thing just a second says look he never went and got dirt and made a Eve but he made from the original dirt amen Adam yes and he took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate and that was Eve she was made for the man and part of the man she was a part of him in the beginning in the creation and the theophany she was a part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided into another creation she had to be made in the same creation amen amen but see that applies to us if we are part of Jesus Christ so what did God do he took a part of that that's theophany which was God yes and then that's theophany we existed and so he took that part of the theophany which was himself and he took that part of that the offering he placed it in human flesh that's why we have the seed of God in us amen it's not theophany that was a part of God from the beginning and that theophany is the real us brother Brown talks about that in in different ways but that's the offering is the real us and what God is trying to do he's trying to take that theophany which was a part of him from the beginning and he's trying to sit there and make us realize who we are and begin to step into the position step into the realm that God has called us to live in brother Branham lived in that realm he didn't he didn't do the the day he was born he didn't do it as a as a Baptist Tracer come in God gave him visions and okay he didn't understand what was going on but yet you look at the progression of his life yeah yeah and all of a sudden when it got down to discernment of Spirit and the people having the different problem all of a sudden he could look into the other dimension he could see the things which were going on so more and more of that that other dimension became more of a reality to him than the dimension in which we're living here Amen in fact there are sometimes people said brother Bradham could not differentiate between which realm he was in because the other realm became such a reality to him right amen but here again we have to begin on Earth we were a part of God from the beginning he's trying to get us back into the into what we what we always are you always were amen but we have to be willing to accept this we have to begin to accept the fact of who we are and what we are because only only as we can do that can we begin to defeat Satan amen amen right the bride realizes who she is and what she is she'll be she'll do she'll be a common Invincible Army amen well then why are we defeated because we don't know who we are brother Brown says Jesus Christ because he can tell the story why he knew who he was he can go to he could find this one that was that had died he could speak the word and see them raise up he could do all the he could take bread and fishes and feed multitude because he knew who he was yes and one place he says I'm trying to get you away from the stare in this scare you don't know who you are you're not willing to accept the fact that you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen but we have to make the transition we have to get out of our thinking as human beings and we have to be able to be willing to accept the fact I was a part of God from the beginning right and now he's trying to use me as it is to express himself through because now is the time when now is the time when we are to come to adoption yes where our word is the same as God himself speaking amen but he has to have the preeminence he has to have the control and he said in one place he says he wanted to have the three things God wanted to accomplish what he had to have preeminence and amen he did that in Jesus Christ now he wants that same preeminence in his new body the church after that we'll go back to the eating condition yeah yeah but he has to have the preeminence amen he has to have the control until we're really until we are willing to relinquish the control of Our Lives to him amen he cannot do what he's wanting to do amen and once you can take and once you can begin to take your life and yield it to him and allow him have the preeminence and you begin to realize it's not about you it's about him it's not what you do it's what you will allow him to do through you amen all of a sudden then you would rest yes because all of a sudden you realize not me doing this God doing this right I get up in the morning and I have my list of things to do and I get a phone call Something's Happened and well that changes today so Lord what do you want where are we going today and what are you wanting to do today because it's no longer me at that point it's him right when I go overseas I realize I really have no control when I get back to the States I figure oh yeah I can still control my life I'm coming to find out no that ain't true either yeah because now God is wanting more and more to take control of my life he's wanting to lead me he's wanting to guide me he's he's trying because if somebody needs to be ministered to how is he going to do it Amen brother round says you are his hands you're his eyes you're his feet your legs your his mouth yes sir if he wants to speak he has to speak to somebody right yes if he needs to go someplace you have to carry him because where is God he's in you so you have to carry him to wherever he's going amen God wants to say somebody's hand he only has your hand to do it with hands have to be laid on somebody he has to use your hand yes I mean you have to begin to understand we are a part of him and he but he wants to he has to have the control amen because if God would release the power that is within us Moses had that power he was supposed to speak to the Rock he got mad he smoked it didn't bring the weather he smoked it again yeah that that made it so he never got to go in the promised land right amen I think it was Elijah or Elijah one of those and all of a sudden oh ball head old ball head and he ain't why didn't you go with you Elijah he got mad yeah call that a bunch of she bears and killed a bunch of kids yeah by the Ramses that was that was the voice of an angry Prophet yeah that wasn't God's will right so you understand the power that dwells within us he has to have the preeminence so that we do not use the power that dwells within us in the wrong way amen amen we understand in First Corinthians 15. he says we were we were God's seed was sowed into a body that's corruptable but it's going to be raised up and incorruption amen we have to go through the process we are going through we have to develop character or the browns's character is not a gift right character is something that forms in your body over time amen over time all of a sudden you get yourself in situations and and so all of a sudden it's how you act or how you react all of a sudden that shows the character that's within you yes very much amen with brother Branham there was one time there was a couple of young people they were they came into church and they started making love in the front of the church there and brother Brad says don't do that there's other places don't don't do that here he warned him two or three times and God says whatever you say that's exactly what it'll be amen if you listen to the tape there's a pause what was brother Branham gonna say Amen he says I forgive you for that because that's Christ amen amen how many other ministers would have said I forgive you for that how many other ministers Witnesses spiked Yourself Dead yeah you're going to be out of cripples here you're going to be you know how would we react amen I try to avoid Atlanta because there'll be a lot fewer drivers in Atlanta if I went through Atlanta yeah but see that be using the word of God in the wrong way I would demand them out of existence yes anyway but you understand what I'm trying to say on this but it has to come to the place where he has the preeminence in our lives where he's the one that actually has the control amen basically the union of the bride of Christ brother Brown says if you're married to Christ Christ is the word of God in Saint John the first chapter it said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ was the Living Word he always was the word he is still the word he always will be the word he was only the manifestation of the attributes of God for he was the son of God yes he goes down he said and so were you amen amen Sons and Daughters of God before there ever was a moon a star or a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God you're you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in God in the beginning right yeah he's relating us when he talks about Jesus Christ now he's relating that to us Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God because he was a the Son of God Amen but he said now also what are you you were part of that attribute you're part of that theophany so now you also are in a manifestation you are an attribute of God that has been expressed and so he's trying to raise us up into the level of believing this is who we are amen what God was in Jesus Christ he's now God in his in his bride God in his church he's trying to get us to Revelation this is what you are amen you are not sin just Sinners saved by grace he says you are Sons and Daughters of God that have been fully restored to your rightful position with your father Hallelujah and what God is trying to do he wants to men he's trying to manifest himself through you the same way he did through the body we call Jesus Christ amen Jesus says it's not me who does the work it's a father who dwells in me he does all the words brother Brown says I never do I never performed a miracle he said I was only standing there when God did this amen because he realized it wasn't him it wasn't about him right right but he was merely standing there and God used him in order for this to be to be expressed well what's the difference where does God dwell amen if all of a sudden God died with brother Branham where in the world are hurt yeah but if we begin to realize that the same God that dwells in him dwells in us and the same God that dwelt in him wants to produce through us the same thing he did through him yes sir it isn't us becoming prophets amen no it's recognizing we're Sons and Daughters of God yes it's recognizing we were a part of God from the beginning and now what he's trying to do is gain preeminence in his bride so that he could live his life through her so he can express himself to the world Amen yes we are in Satan's Eden you know um listening to a brother the other day and he and it talks about you know there'll be Darkness upon the land and gross Darkness upon the people and the brother said you know he used to be you know he tried to stay away from all these people with purple hair and tattoos from their fingertips to their toes or you know but all of a sudden he began to realize there the way they are because of the gross darkness that is upon them forcing them in that direction amen that's right that's right he said a lot of them were good people yeah in fact one of them he related I dreamed that brother Branham had and brother Brown said all these people were were in bondage they were in a prison and you know it makes the concrete and bars and all this other stuff and Jesus came by and said deliver them brother and said well how can I deliver them you know I I don't have the strength to break the bars and the concrete so he said in the name of Jesus Christ Gates of Hell give way amen or something to that effect and once the word was spoken then all of a sudden all of a sudden he said you hear this crackle Miss crunches the bars fell down you know everything but it's the word yes it's being able to speak the word is being able and all the people were delivered brother the Bible says or brother around him anyway he said you know God was telling brother he says they're good people yeah but they're influenced because of the darkness that's upon them yes right that's all they know he says you know you the person that brother round talks about you know Pearson wants to deny that the son exists so it goes down the basement pulls down the shades locks the door you know and he has one little five watt light bulb gone oh that's that's all the light there is no there's a sunshine outside amen but see that's all they see yeah and everybody that that has remained in that basement that's all they see is that little five watt light bulb yeah well you go into you look at the at Society why is the perversion why I mean they're trying to take kids and fight and in the school system they're trying to have them go through sex changes and all this other perversion amen but they go home and what Dad doesn't know who he is Mama doesn't know who she is and they're all tattooed and head to toe and you know he's trying to be her and her she's okay but see that's all they see that's the spirit that's the darkness the gross darkness is upon them amen but you know the Bible tells me that in him was life and the life in him was the life to the world yes and so as we go and interact with people in in the way that we interact with in our daily walks the only light that they're going to see is the light that's expressed through US amen amen because in Jesus Christ was a life amen and that life was the light to men well if we hide the light and we all of a sudden won't let that life Express itself then then the world will remain in that gross Darkness but you know the the darker the world gets you can take a feeble little light and it'll shine very very bright yes we were in Carlsbad Cavern a number of years back and they turned off the light well when you're what 300 feet below ground or something like that uh I mean it's dark yeah and the guy waited a few a little while until our eyes would begin to try and find any light and then I just took you could take a candle simple candle you could sit in there and if you're distance man that shines so bright we could see everything right but see if we do not allow the life of God to express itself through us the gross Darkness controls yes but just a little bit of light it'll break that Darkness amen it'll make it so they can see a way different than the way that they're in yes and this is what God's calling us to do yes you know it's interesting when Adam and even followed Eve desired knowledge she says well look at all the other female animals look at them bringing forth children after their economy well I'm a female why aren't I bringing for I mean this is obviously what what I would assume her reasoning would be and that's where Satan tempted her but then there was the fall I mean she she did not she went to knowledge rather than Faith she went to knowledge rather than relying upon God amen and the sooner she left God and she took our knowledge she died yeah but then when God came down and the cooler of the evening he had out of where yet isn't this a time we normally get together in a time when only I come down and we Fellowship in the cooler in the evening anyway there was sin Adam says I'm hiding over here okay but you know when when in order for God to again have fellowship with his children God performed the sacrifice yes God took an animal and threw that animal and he took the skin of that animal and gave it to his son and his daughter yes he made the sacrifice if we are in Christ we are in the sacrifice God has made for us amen it's not about us it's about him yes he has restored the fellowship he has paid the price he has seen sure that that we have free access to God he has into it that there will be unbroken Fellowship between us and between him amen and that's his desire we are his children yes I mean the parents they liked it they're like the kids to come around you know even when they're being naughty I mean you know I mean I wasn't always a perfect little angel I mean there were times I had to stand up and have my dinner because I couldn't sit down for different reasons but I was always my Father's son yes my father always loved me amen amen I mean yeah when I did things wrong yeah it separated our fellowship for a little while but I was always his son my father always loved me yes well if I knew something wrong yeah I'll get you know spiritually speak to me I'll get corrected I expect to yeah but here again but God has made the way where I can go back and I can have unhindered fellowship with him because of what he has done for me at the cross amen everything I need is back there amen everything without exception we need healing the stripes they laid on his back before they crucified him that was for me amen that purchased my healing yeah so my healing has already been paid for that's right so why do I have to endure it all I have to do is thank him yeah say you've already healed me I am obviously here yes I'm just waiting for its expression praise the Lord okay and so I thank him for healing me even though I may not feel good because I mean here again I don't know any other way to react with this anymore uh yeah like I say if I have a fever and sore throat and a bunch of other stuff yeah I yeah my body tells me you lay down drink flavor fluids get some plenty of sleep yeah you will allow your body to correct itself yes I was having pains in my chest so I went to my doctor he sent me to a Cardiologist they did an ultrasound on my heart I said well don't we there's one little spot we can't determine if it's what's growing what's there is an inside or outside your aorta okay so they headed archive okay if that's the only way I I can find out what's going on okay go ahead you know and uh anyway they put put the thing in did this put the dye in and doctor says you ain't got no blockage nowhere don't call me I'll call you amen okay so I know that the heart the pains that I've been having are not heart related they're obviously something else indigestion or pulled muscle or who knows what but I wanted to know so I would know what to pray for yes yes I know my wife when we were in Youth Camp all of a sudden she fell into a shower for her her children are really bad I mean she couldn't even lift her arm we saw that we saw the the orthopedic surgeon and he he took x-rays or gas scans or whatever and he's oh yeah you've torn three muscle or tendons or whatever the thing is and uh um Okay so he says well he says over time it should heal itself and but we'll send you to physical therapy so you can strengthen the muscles and the tendons and stuff and for the next month I guess you basically she endured you know going to physical therapy and then we're having our youth camp our our cat meeting and all of a sudden um the spirit of God just kind of moved through the audience my wife raised both of her hands and just began to scream and praise God Amen she was healed praise the Lord yes why she had to wait till then God never tells us these things so he healed it wasn't the doctor it wasn't the therapy it wasn't anything else no it was God himself intervening on our behalf and healing her yes and so and and she she always was thanking God and then we went back to the doctor um deeper the appointment and she showed all the range of motions and stuff and he says wow you know and my wife testified to him yeah see God touched me and God healed me he says you know I believe God does that I believe in Divine Healing healing yes and so he Rejoice with us in the fact that God had touched her and God had healed her but it was another indication to him that God does do this yes okay amen right I might have quoted this last time but it's in the Legacy in church Aid brother brother Brown goes on and and talks about who who is Christ in this in the in in this generation he says he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church there's a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom he's creating his own bride yes so God created you with all of your problems and all of your short timings and all of your personalities and warts and all he created you for the way that you are because he hasn't he has a use for you some people know how to take engines apart and put it back together again um I know how to put the gas in I know how to push the button to start yeah okay um other people like I say they have a better knowledge of that my my brother he understands computers and programming and how to do this that and the other and I know how to turn it on I know how to use certain programs I'm limited yeah he has a lot more knowledge than I have but God wired him that way but he's wired me this way yeah yeah amen okay I cannot become him he cannot become me I cannot become you you cannot become me amen he made us different yes he made us different for a reason okay so is but if God the Creator created himself his bride okay and he goes on and talks about Jesus Christ he was the god-man he was the son of God and he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of a new race and he is the head of that new race amen and we are a new creation we are no longer part of the old creation right amen we are distinct from that creation I am not part of Satan's End Amen that's Adam's creation right that's that that that creation Satan controls no I'm part of a different creation yes I am a part of a creation that God himself has created I'm a part of that new creation in which God himself has now coming and dwelling in me and God now wants the preeminence in me amen God is trying to express himself through me and so he's trying to show that creation there's a distinction between that creation and this creation praise the Lord you know he can only do that when all of a sudden I allow him to have their preeminence in my life amen he has the premise in my life that all of a sudden that creation can see a different creation and if there's something inside of them they will respond to that new creation yes hallelujah amen brother round says this is a true revelation of God uh days of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished who is God what is God I'm looking at him right I mean in reality I'm looking at him where does God dwell today he dwells in you yes okay so so you are you are the true revelation of God but he has to get in and finish molding and making you into into his very image because that's the whole idea that what God is trying to do it's God who we're working in you to willing to do of his good pleasure amen he's not I mean I I like to do woodworking I take a piece of wood and if the wood could speak it says all right what are you gonna do with me so I take it to the I take it to the I run through through the planer take off some rough edges and smooth it all out the wood wouldn't like that if it could speak because all of a sudden a lot of it is being chewed away yeah and then all of a sudden I take it over to the bandsaw I sit there and I start cutting out perimeter and I mean that really hurts you know like cutting off arms and legs and stuff and then all of a sudden then I take another pattern I lay it on top of that and I start doing the end until until that image that I see now comes into expression amen right well that's what he's doing to us yes you've probably already gone through the planer you're probably already gone through the band saw and now he's sitting with the intricate work and he's starting to make the fine amen until the very image which God saw in the beginning now all of a sudden that comes into manifestation yes praise the Lord that's a brother round goes on and says his Sovereign power brought up the paths by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will amen by his omniscience and his omnipotence he brought it to pass it's not about you amen it's all about him Jesus prayed an awful lot because he wanted to find out Lord what are you wanting me to do today he never chose the twelve until God had showed him which ones to pick out yes brother Branham prayed a lot because I mean especially when you get to the latter part of his ministry because he had God would he had to be sensitive enough to the spirit of God whether God could tell him I want you to go here I want you to go there I want you to do something that time that that lady was praying and brother Brown was on a flight home that all of a sudden the plane was grounded brother Brown didn't know why he got up in the morning he was going to mail a letter or something like that and all of a sudden God told him walk yeah yeah brother I'm supposed to I'm supposed to meet up they're going to pick you know and God just I don't want your arguments just walk amen where am I no walk yes so he walked amen and finally there was a colored sister and she was leaning on the on the gate Martin Parson been waiting on you God showed me a bit he was coming by the way where's I think his hat or something was he didn't have on and brother answered do you know who I am no never heard of you before yeah you understand the revelation of the Seven Seals you understand the church all of a sudden the seventh seal you've got a revelation to the seventh seal right no no but she had a relationship with God she says I am not sure tonight woman where is your Elijah yes amen that prayer brought that plane down so that God's Elijah could go to her house and minister to her need yes amen we need the same relationship with God that that lady had yes where we could pray and God will God will change world events Amen to bring to pass what he what we have praise the Lord yes amen brother Brown and the church in this condition he says on that day that John baptized Jesus at the River Jordan one of the greatest events that everyone said he could take in place taking place right there he said the Dove and the lamb United together that's when God and man became one yeah that's when Heaven and Earth Embrace each other Hallelujah that's when God was made flesh uh that's when God came down in the spirit form and was made a man and dwelt Among Us amen and God and man was made one on the great Memorial Day when John baptized Jesus yes and then then and then in making God his promise that was speaking of the time that Jesus Christ was baptized he said that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and will see yes until Christ and the church has United together again amen amen so when all of a sudden Christ unites with his bride he said that will be a greater event than when God came down and dwelt in that body because he's old Christ amen amen brother Branham goes on in the Messiah he says now for instance when a man gets saved it's just like the light that comes into him is about the size of this little button on my shirt he talks about and talks about we are there there's where there's we dwell in three Realms the outer the The Flash and the spirit and the soul he said there's only one entrance into the Shekinah Glory where God can enter into him and take over in the control tower and that way is through self-will yes whether you will to or not it's up to you but that's the only Avenue that's open to man and God where God can come into his heart is by self will yes it puts him right back like Adam and Eve on free moral agency again you can choose the right or the wrong either one that you want to he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can become back into the same condition that he was when he was in the garden yes he said you have to will to do God's will it just doesn't happen amen because your flesh is going to say I don't want to yeah it's time for going to church I don't want to I don't feel like it I could go out mowing grass I could go out fishing I could go out boating I I could go out hiking there's a whole host of it beautiful day outside why am I in church you have to Will there has to be something inside of you that desires to do whatever God wants done amen amen yes and like I said like brother Brown says you choose amen you choose to follow God's word or not yes you choose to believe God's promise or not you choose to do the things that you know are righteous or not amen it's your will it's it's self-will and so here again brother Graham says you have to choose I'd say otherwise it's you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right I'll go with you and I you will be a part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like husband or wife was one person you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the fathers and me I am in you and you and me amen we'll understand the godhead yes how could Jesus Christ be God because the spirit of God dwelt in him and the spirit of God dwelling in him became the expression that God was able to fully Express himself through that body amen that's how God and that that's how God and Jesus Christ literally became one because that spirit of God had the control it had the preeminence oh I just love that Satan gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ now the Christ was reported in the church there you are it makes them all one amen it makes them one it makes them one because it became God himself so dwelling in in him until Jesus Christ until he was a full manifestation of God and now all of a sudden it'll be God coming in in his sons and daughters and he will have the preeminence in their lives where literally God will be able to live his life through them yes and the closer we get to that The Closer we'll get back to Eden the closer we'll get back to the way Adam had in the Garden of Eden the closer we will get to the place where we we will not walk by knowledge we will not walk by how we feel we will not walk by the whatever is going around no we will walk by the direction of God and God himself amen will be God living his life through us and then we will become the expression or the manifestation of God Christ the ministry of God revealing and and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of of his godhead deity through his church amen not just through the prophet no through his church yes sir the prophet God fulfilled what God wanted to fulfill in brother Brown's life amen and I'm not doing away with him I'm not trying to in any way in any way make you know put that down we would not know who we are if it hadn't been for what God's told us through that Prophet yes God sent that Prophet to tell me who I am amen without that prophet's message I would not understand who I am and what I am and what God is trying to do in my life amen but Hannah he says God can express himself the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and and the bridegroom amen but but the eve of the last day she's not going to do it she's not going to fall she's predestinated to do it you know sometimes we wonder if we're going to make it there was a time when he lied to us having a bad day he went off into the mountain hit himself in the cave God says he's God said what are you doing here I'm the only one everybody else is forsaken you know I'm all that's left yeah I'm tired of fighting I'm tired of all the stuff going on just take me home I said what do you mean you're the only one I have reserved myself seven thousand you're not the only one amen I reserve I have kept God kept them yes they never kept themselves right God kept them amen God has a bride how does he how do we know he had he has kept her amen he has kept her pure he is revealing himself to her it's God doing it's not us doing this right we would be out in the world doing the things of the world we'd be in Satan's eating just you know enjoying ourselves out there if it wasn't for the fact that God had predestined us before the foundation of the world that he's going to come and reveal himself to us yes and by him revealing himself to us he's drawing us to himself until until more and more he he is taking the preeminence in our lives amen God reserved that's right that's why he has it do you know I says I hear ministers oh God's going to have oh no no no no no he has one amen I'm part of it I'm part of it yes how do you know I'm not out there in that world and and there's something inside of me that's moving me and guiding me and directing me and I'm pulling my teeth and whatever you know trying to get me to do what he wants me to do amen amen I mean if it wasn't if it wasn't for God guiding and directing my life yeah I wouldn't be able to claim being a son right I would be doing my own thing sure but there's something inside of me that's changing me from the inside amen it's molding my character and making me to become more like him praise the Lord yes Christ the ministry of God brother Brian goes on and he says when I see God's great power revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight uh the leading amen he said he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there have to be a shave waved again in the last days Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bride aid for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has been has turned back again in his sole power and being waved over the People by the signs and their Wonders that he did back there yes the full maturity of the word has been given to us right amen that's what we have access to yes but he has to have the preeminence yes amen he had it in brother Brown's life it's true he had it in Jesus Christ he had it in Paul he had in some bunch of the others we could we could name but only as they yielded themselves to God could God fully Express himself through them so we have the full maturity of the word has been given to us amen but now it's us coming into the position where God has the control of us so that he can express himself through out yes what shall I do with Jesus called Christ he says it's a uniting time of God and his bride I believe the mechanics is here they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the rapture the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the blood but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just like just exactly like that a H but even the last days is not going to be because she's predestined not to fall he knows that that he'll have her um he has a spot the church would be there without spot and wrinkle amen notice then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separated them in death now Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original original Eden restoring back his bride and fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden Christ in the bride amen we were a part of God from the beginning we can accept that and we can accept the fact that God has taken in place his seed in US and the only thing that seed can manifest is the life that was in that sea and the life that was in that seed is the life of God himself that means the only thing that seed can produce is God amen amen but we have to allow it Jesus Christ talks about you take seed and you throw it on on you know I throw a sour sowing seed oh yeah the seed in one place is thrown on the Rocks there's no place it could get any any grass but no moisture another one of the ground's packed because people walk by and the birds are picking it all up another one oh yeah the seed went into went into another place but the weeds choked it all out but couldn't produce but he says every now and then Fallon's a good ground yes yeah is 40 and 16 100 but see in the bride it has to be it's it's not Fallen by the wayside it's not falling the Rocks it's not no it fell into good ground amen and now God is trying to take that which was a part of him and bring it into full manifestation yes and so it could be God living his life now through Us Praise the Lord amen let's just close in a word of Prayer the most gracious loving Heavenly Father it has been our privilege to sit at your feet and to receive what you'd have for us this morning thank you so take the words that have been spoken Lord and Quicken it to all of our hearts Lord give me a greater understanding of that which I've been just preaching here this this morning the Lord you and I are one and now you're trying to live your life through me so Lord I take take control of this life they control the lives that are before me and so begin to buy your spirit mold and bake us into the very image of who you are yes Jesus said Lord we can be the full expression of you or yourself Grant this Lord for I'm asking it in Jesus Christ's name amen foreign has given us today to understand for God to reveal it to us um it's not a matter of understanding something it's a matter of God revealing it to you yes God reveal to understand that it's God Christ in you the hope of glory then then that's what makes all the difference amen it's Christ in you praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen appreciate the message amen trusting and believing it was a blessing to you but I know of course if false our lot and our position to recognize that placement that we are and not necessarily where we came from although that's valuable who we are now although that's very important where we're going amen well God is laid for us and spoken to us and showed her who we are in him amen praise the Lord and I want to sing this little course number 544. creation [Music] let's sing it Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'm a brand new man amen let's see it again time Hallelujah hearing me and I've been born again [Music] and I thank God he justified me and of his fullness I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man all things are passed away I've been wondering that's what I am I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man foreign amen praise the Lord Jesus brand new in Jesus Christ amen the same yesterday today and forever yes amen power without character is satanic amen power without character you know a lot of times people equate that to Supernatural power but it could be any kind of power just power over your own life being a free moral agent gives you power do you know that and without the character of God to mold it in you to make the right decisions to speak the right word to do the right things to become the right person it's satanic yes that's why people end up as brother Noel was talking about living in that dark place amen they don't have the character with the power they have to make their lives and themselves Godly amen Holy Ghost born again of what you consider I guess I'll guess what you say today normal uh that's probably not even a word anymore but that power they have without the character then that's what you end up with yes amen they have power of decision I'm going to do this to my body they have that power without the character to mold it the way that the word says then you end up in the Darkness you end up with satanic looking things and uh the celebration of the Halloween and all that's coming up amen people know people know exactly where it comes from they know what it does they know the point and and still do it churches I I don't understand it I don't understand it but anyway I choose to live in the light amen amen but the power without the with the power without the character amen is satanic praise the Lord doesn't have to be Supernatural just decisions you make every day right where you conduct your life the things that you say the way you speak to other people amen that has value in weight and without the character of God molded in you like he said molded in you praise the Lord help me Lord I'm still growing yeah still still molding himself in me to be just like him praise the Lord be to the place that the reflection of Jesus Christ is so true in my life that people can't tell the difference amen amen amen praise the Lord I believe that's where he's probably that's the exactly one point said brother Noah was trying to make to us amen points he was reading in Christ and mystery God revealed or uh the uh and a couple of those quotes that's what that Prophet came to do that's one of the things yeah and what brother Noel was trying to get for us today so let that lesson be to us and let that character cause the only way that character can mold more in you is more of you has to die the only way amen it's like filling a glass there's only so much water is going to go in here if you try to put more water then this can contain it just flows out but the only way to put more water is to take more water out or you want to put juice in whatever it is you want more of Christ in you more of you's got to go away right die away so that more of him is alive in you amen that's what the new birth does lives in you continues to grow in you praise the Lord when he's born in you he does it's not a little infant and amen it grows into a mature adult Jesus said be thou perfect amen like my Father in Heaven is perfect that perfect is full of Age full grown mature and that's what he wants us to be in his word praise the Lord so God reaches to bless you and appreciate each one to come and coming in here today and today was a day I was gonna wish my granddaughter happy birthday her
