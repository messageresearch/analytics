Keep us burning for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Have a couple prayer requests to bring your attention today. Amen. And brother Dennis writes out a request for him and his wife Leah. Says, "Please remember my wife Leah in prayer. She's recovering good uh after her surgery, but still has days where she feels pain and discomfort. Also for brother Dennis uh with foot, knee, and back problems, which uh makes things uh makes it hard to get around at times. Thank you. God bless you." Amen. I imagine it does. uh kind of the three components you really need to take a step. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kind of hard without feet, knees, and back uh to be able to even walk. So thankful to have brother Dennis back with us. Brother Danny, of course, too. Amen. God richly bless you. So thankful that you're able to be with us back with us again today. Amen. Sister uh uh well, I don't remember. My wife told me last night, "Who told you about Sister Dorothy?" Was it Norma? Okay. It's usually Sister Norma. I almost says Sister Norma without verification. So, uh, but it was Sister Norma. Uh, let us know that Sister Dorothy is now on hospice care at home. Uh, her daughter Dee said she is not doing uh, very well at all. She's getting weaker and weaker. So, uh, Sister Dorothy may be going home to be with the Lord here pretty soon. So, Please remember her, the family in prayer if you would. Amen. We don't know what the Lord has in store. This is Sister Dorothy's last few days on this earth. And um she's run a good race. She's fought a good fight. She's kept the faith and Amen. And I believe Sister Dorothy's &gt;&gt; uh ready to go be with the Lord. Amen. So, but please remember her in prayer family if you would. &gt;&gt; Uh also got a text from Brother Roger Collins this morning. uh he informed me that his mother died uh passed away this morning. So hate using the word die. A Christian doesn't die. I I just don't when talk about Christians, I don't use the word died. &gt;&gt; Uh they passed away. They went from one dimension to another. That's all it is. &gt;&gt; Uh and of course, sister uh brother Rogers mother was most definitely a godly sister, Christian in the Lord. Uh but she did pass away. I believe he told me this morning actually. So, please remember, of course, she lives in Georgia, so they're three hours ahead of us, but uh please remember brother Roger, uh his family in prayer, if you would uh the passing of the mother, uh I told brother Roger, of course, we would be praying for them and if there's anything at all that we can do for them, uh to please let us know. So, please remember that in prayer if you would. Uh also, got some finalization on Sister Lydia's memorial service. As I text you yesterday, Sister Religious memorial service will be Saturday morning, uh, the 6 August 16th at 11:00 a.m. Amen. at the Tucson Tabernacle. So hopefully everyone of you can go be there, be a part of that. Sister Lydia's memorial service uh is Saturday the 16th of August at 11:00 a.m. at Tucson Tower. Uh I am very appreciative to brother Dan uh and the brothers there to allow us to use the church tabernacle there. Although the VAS were very much part of the tabernacle for many many years. Uh I got a text from brother Robert Figureroa who remembers sister Lydia back before she was even married. Uh last name Loftton I think he told me. So back in the apostolic days I didn't even know that. I think that's what he told me anyway. Uh, oddly enough, Sister Lydia and and Brother Robert, their uh, children, Brother Robert's son Bobby and Sister Lydia's uh, daughter Jennifer graduated the first year of TLC uh, school that we had uh, at the at at Tucson Tabernacle. The first year of TLC school, they were the two graduates uh, Bobby Figareroa and Jennifer Via. So, uh, but, uh, please remember them in prayer if you would. Uh, the Lord will just bless the family, continue to comfort them and be with them and, uh, all that they're having to do now. So, just please remember them. Uh, I am, as I text yesterday, headed back to Houston. Um, so I appreciate your prayers for that. Not I I will not be, at least for the most part, I will not be working outside this week. So, it will be somewhat better. It's still going to be warm and humid. U but uh at least it won't be so much in the sun. Uh my manager told us yesterday what little we're going to try what little we kind of need to do still outside is going to be done in the morning hours. Uh but I'm not even doing that. I've got stuff I have to do inside the tunnel. So, I won't even be outside. But it'll be hot and humid. But again, I appreciate your prayers for traveling mercies and uh and um and the work week. So, I do appreciate that very much. Anyone else have a request on your part today? &gt;&gt; So, Micah's leaving Wednesday. I mentioned last Sunday. Uh Micah is going on a trip. So, please remember him in prayer. He's leaving Wednesday. He'll be back in two weeks. 21st. So, give or take two weeks. So, he will be gone two Sundays from us. Uh but, uh please remember him. Lord bless his trip and grant traveling mercy sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. So please remember sister Judy Arnold. We mentioned that a couple Sundays ago. She's gonna have more surgery on her eye. Just remember else brother Dennis take his pray. Lord Jesus, it's an honor once again to be in your house. Yes. &gt;&gt; Worship, your house of praise, a place where we can truly hear the reveal word of the hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; A message that you have sent &gt;&gt; to get a bride ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I was thinking about it as I was driving to church. It's your grace &gt;&gt; that you have called us into your marvelous truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. your marvelous life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. It's nothing that we deserve or nothing we earn or it's not anything that that gave us the opportunity to receive the truth. It's all by your grace. &gt;&gt; It's all by your election. &gt;&gt; It's all by your love, Lord, that you let us recognize we were a part of you before the foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Handwriting is on the wall. &gt;&gt; The enemy knows this message, knows that we're better than any of us, but he cannot live it &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it takes your Holy Spirit in us to get us to the place where we can live your word, Father. We can obey your word. It'd be automatic, but it comes to praying. We'll just meditate and pray one for another. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. love one another more so as we see that day approaching. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; You'll come to a place where we'll have a burden for the lost &gt;&gt; knowing that you're coming is knocking at the door. Father, we see so many people on the streets that look troubled and worrisome and and maybe having mental problems, but they're your children as well. Father, let us have a burden for the lost. Father, &gt;&gt; oh God. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let us have a burden. The Lord, this assembly meets one time a week. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; there's many churches in this message that meet three times a week. And Lord, we struggle to obey you in that sense. Lord, you're a rewarder of them that diligently seek you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we must put that effort Brother Brown, I just heard him say that we got to fight for every inch of ground that we gain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua had to fight for every inch of ground that you gave him. But he knew that you were in charge. You were in control and he possessed the gates of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we this morning must possess the gates of the enemy. Amen. recognize when the devil is playing games with us. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Giving us an excuse not to obey your word in any way. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, there are many that are sick. They need a touch from you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; For thou are a great physician, our high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And with this, we are healed. We claim our healing. Our sister Julie having a headache. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; she's here by faith. Father, &gt;&gt; may you reach out and deliver her right now from that headache condition. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For the prophet said, we don't have to take anything the enemy wants to throw at us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater he that's in us than he that's in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I have overcome for you. You said, "Father, and Father, we I claim my healing. Um, oh, Father, I know by faith I'm even here by your grace, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; And Lord, I just want to draw closer like everyone else that's here. I want to draw closer to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. &gt;&gt; And Father, may you just continue to give me strength to do what I'm called to do. We're here for one purpose. We're not here to do our jobs. We're not here to please our families. We're not here to please our friends. We're here to do your will to be of service for you. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You have to be first. You have to be preeminent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Father, my wife who's been um doing good, but she has days that that she has so much discomfort. May you touch her and deliver her from that condition, Father. And Lord, for our loved ones unsaved, not serving you. My wife, she says she's a believer, but Lord, she needs to walk in the light of the truth of your word for this hour. Open up her eyes. &gt;&gt; Open up the eyes of our loved ones that are my servant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we believe for their salvation. We believe for their deliverance, God. And Lord, all the um requests, I can't remember them all, but you heard them. That's the main thing. You know what each and everyone has need of Father, &gt;&gt; for brother Micah to be traveling for traveling mercy. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And for everyone else that need to touch all the unspoken prayer requests, may you touch them all. May their cup runth over by the blessings of your Holy Spirit working in their lives. Bless bless our brother as he brings your word. Oh Lord, faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God. We're here to draw closer. We're here to hunger and thirst for your righteousness and we shall be filled and Lord in your name we pray. Name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be seated if you'd like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Micah has a song for us today. go ahead and sing for us song many times since I won't be out of town for memorial. So that's along [Music] kind of for a country [Music] to which I never been before. No sad goodbyes will there be spoken [Music] and time won't matter anymore. to the land. I'm longing for you. And someday on me I'll stand.

And someday [Music] on thee I will stand. [Music] There my hope shall be eternal [Music] and you love you the land of mercy. [Music] Now we are looking [Music] across that great river to where our faithful inside. We have just a few more days we have to baby. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Praise the Lord. Amen. How many's longing for that place? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Longing for that land, that place of perfect rest. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Anyone have a testimony real quick before we change? Yes, &gt;&gt; my refrigerator went out on Friday and just kind of knowing how hores are going everywhere and came to mind that a couple years ago I found a place called I got a wash. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Still running. So I called them and went down Friday and actually told my daughter I'll be back half an hour cutting it close &gt;&gt; and I bought a refurbish smaller on purpose. I think it has more dense than my bed on the outside inside. &gt;&gt; It's great. &gt;&gt; So, in less than 24 hours, God has &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Wonderful. He knows how to do it. Knows where to send us and shows us. Sometimes you just just how things work out the way they do. But you just give all the glory to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just walk in his will and he'll lead you where he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. He always takes care of us. Praise the Lord. Anybody else? Amen. If not, we'll just stand to our feet and then go to the scripture back over to Romans chapter 8. Read those few scriptures. Amen. To begin the service today. Romans chapter 8. Praise the Lord. 14-17. We'll begin our reading again. Romans 8 14-17. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Good to see each one. God bless you. Amen. Romans 8:14. Before we read, we just bow our heads for another word of prayer. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, for all that you've done for us, given to us, God. So many testimonies and so many things that we could say, so many so much exaltation, so much praise we could give to you, Lord, for all that you do for us so many times, God. &gt;&gt; As I've said many times, probably many, many times that we don't even recognize it, Lord. But we know it's your hand, God. It's your hand that leads us, guides us. We're just following that truth, Lord. and you just show us that path every step of the way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you take control of the remaining part of this service. Bless the reading of your word now, not return it void, but accomplish that in each one that you' sent it forth for. Bless us, God, and speak through these lips the word you'd have us to hear. Anoint every one of our ears as we receive this word today. May it become a part of us as we live it. &gt;&gt; And Lord, walk out of this place today if it be your will, God. And let this word continue to permeate from our very beings. &gt;&gt; Yes. We commit ourselves to you this service now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 verse1 14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption. Whereby we cry, Abby, Father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. children than heirs, heirs of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. And I did not anticipate this to be a very long service, but uh I ended last week u with uh sort of toward the end of this part of the position in Christ, but a little too much to continue on last week. Uh but um uh so we just roll it over into this week is so is uh so the Lord have his way but as I see it uh it shouldn't be a very long service today. I just want to pick up back where we left off last week though in Joshua. So let's go back to the book of Joshua. We were speaking of the parallels some of the parallels uh between Joshua and Ephesians and the positionally placing. Now, this is adoption part 23, position in Christ part seven. So, this positioning uh that we're going to finish up today. Uh this positioning is what Joshua did. That was his commission that God gave him of his commission uh for the children of Israel. We also find out in Ephesians where that book by the Holy Ghost positionally places the bride, Amen, in the body of Christ. We already know you're part of the body of Christ. Israel didn't have to be placed as Israel. They were already Israel. They were already God's chosen people. Uh we were already God's children. We were already a part of the body of Christ. We were already the bride of Jesus Christ. God didn't have to place us. It it's not a matter of being a part of God's body. It's what part of that body we play. The position that the Holy Spirit places us in. Amen. So that's the finalization of what we want to talk about here in the paralleling of Joshua and Ephesians. So let's go back to Joshua chapter 1. We'll just read a few verses here. And then there's another particular point as I was reading it this morning that the Lord pointed out to me that I want to make note of that has that goes along with something I had not seen before but kind of goes along with what we had spoke on two or three weeks ago. Amen. Now Joshua 1:1. Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun. Moses ministered, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore, rise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel, to that land that he was to divide out. Now, God gave the land, but it was Joshua's commission to divide out that land. Right. &gt;&gt; So, we come to a time where this great man, Moses, I mean, that's probably not a very good adjective to describe Moses. He was uh he was God's man that was uh one of the most transformable figures ever in history of humanity. Uh but Moses, this great man, reached a place where he come to his end. Amen. And Moses did the great job with what God gave him because Moses represented the law. We know Moses represented the law. Uh which in our case as far as we uh in Christianity is concerned would be considered uh the justification and sanctification part of that law to be justified and sanctified but not put into use yet. And remember we talked about of course that's where a lot of people end up is between justification and filled with the Holy Ghost. Same place that Judas Escariot found himself when we know in the scripture he was justified by what Jesus said in the word and Jesus then would with him standing there said sanctify them by thy word. Thy word is truth. So we know that he was justified and sanctified but he killed himself before he could go on to the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost. A lot of people end up in this place in this transition period. A lot of people in this message ended up in that transition period. Uh a lot of people with John the Baptist ended up in that transitional period where when John come up, John the Baptist said, "I must decrease that he increase." Amen. It's time for me to go away. See, it was Moses time to go away. Praise the Lord. and all that he did and the greatness of his uh uh uh placement on earth and all he did. It comes a time when it's his time to go away. It was John the Baptist time when when it come that time for John to go away. And John spoke of it specifically and said I must go away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John himself said that I I must decrease so that he who Jesus Christ that was standing there should increase. Amen. So my ministry is decreasing. Amen. Which was uh which was a representation again of the law. But then Jesus came forth and brought forth grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The law Moses had to go away so grace could be brought the grace dispensation and uh grace placement into uh that land was to come forth with Joshua. Amen. We know the uh but but we also know that a lot of people continued to hold Moses up in that standard and did not recognize Joshua in the position that God exalted him to. Amen. It's few not as many of course like it was Moses. Moses had a greater battle with those people uh especially Dayan and Kora. But uh Joshua didn't have to deal with that as much but he still had those people that were the Moses followers. Amen. John the Baptist had the same thing when when Jesus when John was in was in prison and Jesus ministry had rose to its prominence to the place that it was at the time. John even sent as the Bible said some of his disciples. Amen. Even though John said I must decrease and he increase. Even though he was in jail and Jesus ministry was the the prominent thing that was going forth at that time. John the Baptist still had disciples, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; John the Baptist still had people even though John himself said, "Follow ye him." Pointing to Jesus Christ, people still follow John. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it's just human nature. Sometimes it's just a fulfillment of a position a person is supposed to play. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I more so feel that last part is more accurate than the first part. uh that we all have a part to play. We all have Hitler had a part to play. Brother Ram said that we all have a part to play and they had their part to play. So John the Baptist sent his disciples, the Bible said his disciples to go ask Jesus, the one they should be following, the one that John the Baptist said to follow. So if you believe John the Baptist, why are you still his disciple when he himself told you to follow him? &gt;&gt; Amen. But he still had disciples, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses still had disciples. John the Baptist still had disciples. Same thing happened today. Same. Amen. There's a lot of people that all this message about is brother Brandham. That's all this is about is brother Brandham. And they're brother Brandham disciples. Even though brother Brandham himself said follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham did the same thing John the Baptist did and said follow ye him. I must decrease. That's his time to increase. It's my time to go away. And brother Random did go away. But brother Vanom still today has disciples. &gt;&gt; I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ myself because the the man that I believed in this message told me to. That was his advancement. That was his notice. That was his advice. Follow him. So we look to Christ now and recognize that this message isn't about brother Brandham. This message is about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just used that man to bring it to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I'm thankful for that. And God bless. I I can't wait to one day be able to meet Brother Brandham and shake his hand. Amen. and thank him for every fiber that I could muster my being to thank him for the sacrifice that he made to bring this message to us and obey the Lord and all that he did. But brother Bradom has gone away. Amen. John the Baptist was gone away. Moses was gone away. Now, as Moses went away, God began to speak to someone else, Joshua. As John the Baptist went away, it was Jesus time. When Jesus went away, of course, in the upper room, he anointed the disciples, filled them with the Holy Spirit, and away we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now we're at the end. We're we're not at a time. Look, saints, we're not at a time in history of a continuence, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're at a time of an end. Th this whole thing is almost over. Amen. We're not looking for another prophet. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a continuation. &gt;&gt; We're looking to get into the position and placement where this bride is ready to go home in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're ready for an end, not a continuence. They had a continuence. Thus, God chose Joshua to continue on to lead them over Jordan and to take them up to Jericho and to take them into the promised land and divide that promised land up to the children of Israel that God had already given them. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had given them, promised it to them. What is the promise that we have today? What did God promise us? I may be getting ahead of myself a little bit, but what did God promise us? We'll read it. He promised us the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham went away. Why? He had to decrease so that Christ increase. Our eyes aren't on a man. Only that man, Jesus Christ. Our eyes on brother Brandham. But a lot of people still are. There's several people's that's that's all there. I told you before. I mean remember years ago when me and my wife started really serving the Lord and got filled with the Holy Ghost and there were people even around probably more so then I don't there probably are now I don't know as many of them maybe now but I mean one of her comments was oh if brother Brandham were only still here and I've and I've heard that as recently as a few years ago from people if brother Brandham were only still here he would be 120 Honey, if he were here, he might be able to breathe. Uh, but the point is, the God that was in, Brother Brandham is is here. &gt;&gt; The God that was with brother Brandham is here. The God that led Brother Brandham is here. The God that spoke through Brother Brandham is here. The God that healed those people that Brother Brandham prayed for is still here. He's still the same God now. We didn't worship and serve William Brandham. to worship and serve Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's our savior. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not brother Brandham. Jesus Christ is my savior. Jesus Christ is my God, my lord, my savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will bow down one day next to William Brandom and worship our savior. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because he's got the same savior I do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he had to go away. Now, the promise that God had given the children of Israel was this land that was their inheritance. God had given them an inheritance. Keep a lot of these key words I'm talking about in mind as we go over into Ephesians in a minute. God gave this to them as an inheritance and said, "My servant Moses, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore, rise go over this Jordan. Thou and all this people into the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon, thou have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness to this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea, towards the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Think about a beautiful promise. Look what he says now. Be strong and of a and of a good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. Only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Remember Moses representation of the law. Amen. Command thee, turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. So even though Joshua brought in the placement, even though he was a representation of the Holy Ghost, even though he was to uh uh represented grace and their placement, he still was to follow the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people want to take the grace that and separate the grace of God versus the judge of the New Testament versus the judgment God of the Old Testament. Same God. &gt;&gt; God did not change from the Old Testament to the New Testament. He's the same God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just because grace was entered in to this uh in this place, this Joshua representing grace, the Holy Ghost, just because it was introduced didn't change the word and it didn't change God's desire for us to follow that word as he told as he told Joshua. Joshua is entering in to this new era. But God tells him, "Don't you dare turn the the word that I gave Moses, don't you dare turn to the right hand, to the left hand from it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That thou mayest prosper. Praise God. Whethersoever thou goest, a lot of people wonder why they don't prosper. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then uh for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee what? Be strong and of a good courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with him whethersoever thou goest. Be strong &gt;&gt; and of a good courage. What did we talk about the other day a couple weeks ago &gt;&gt; that brother Ram talked about when he got that sword in his hand that the spirit come and spoke to him and said that's the sword of the king. But it takes the hand of strong faith, strong faith to drive it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he telling Joshua? Be strong and of good courage. Three times. In how many? In four verses, five verses. Three times he tells him, be strong and of a good courage. Be faithful. Stay. Hold strong to that faith, to that conviction, to that truth, to that word that you know is right. Hold strong to it. Be strong in it. Take the faith. Take the faith with the sword of the word and drive it to the heart of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am with you. Amen. I am with you. Go. He He told Joshua, he tells us today, I am with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You take that sword, that word to the heart of the enemy with faith. Be strong of good courage. Because remember, this promised land was their inheritance. But they still had to fight for it. They still had to fight to hold it. They still had discouragement. There was still death there. They still had uh uh life that they had to live and and and all that they had the discouragements and things all that they had to go through. But look, it was a place of peace because God would give it to them. Amen. They used to have a uh back when I was a kid, they used to I don't know if they do it anymore, but they used to have what they called a mortgage burning. You guys ever heard of that or been to a mortgage burning? When a person or family or couple paid off their house, once the house got fully paid off, the bank would send them their mortgage in the mail. Amen. And they would take that mortgage to a fire pit and burn it to show as a signification, this is our house now. &gt;&gt; The bank has no lean on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was a sign of comfort. It was a sign of It was It was like a sign of peace that had come over. Amen. I own this now. This belongs to me. Of course, now if the government wants to take it, they'll take it just like that and there's nothing you can do about it. But anyway, uh because that's this world. But it belonged to them. See, and that's just said that the the children of Israel had that same peace that they had &gt;&gt; that it belonged to them. It was their placement. It was their inheritance. It's where they were supposed to be. What greater peace is there, saints, than being in a position and place where you know you belong? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, there is none greater. I I've wrestled times with with things and places and and things I've done and where I knew I didn't belong and maybe and just, you know, to myself, I'm like, this is just temporary. It's a stop gap. This is not going to last long. Whatever that just to keep that. But there was no peace there. There was no comfort. It was just all it was a constant struggle. Amen. But there was peace in it. Amen. Even though you know that there's something that's that you go through in life, see as they did fighting and struggling and they had to live in it. That was their promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we we don't couple our promised land with heaven. Our scriptural promised land is in heaven. Our scriptural canaan is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our promised land is in the Holy Ghost. And in the Holy Ghost, we have peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we know we belong. We know this is where we're supposed to be. We know that this is what God has called and mandated and predestined for us. So, we know that where we're supposed to be. So, there's peace. But look, saints, every morning you wake up, every night that you sleep, every day that you live, you're in a constant fight and battle with the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To fight for every inch of ground. God told Joshua, "Wherever the souls of your feet are, but you got to fight every inch to get that soul on that ground." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you got to have a strong hand of faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. to take this word to the heart of the enemy and realize and know that God said, "I will be with you. I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. Whereversoever thou goest, I am with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What what greater confidence can we have than to stand in faith and realize that God is with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we use the word. The word is God. And we take our strong hand of faith and take that work to the heart of the enemy. That puts us in our position. Let's go over to Ephesians now. &gt;&gt; Is that puts us in our position, our place where we're supposed to be &gt;&gt; where there's peace, where there's comfort. You know, we have struggles and battles and things that we fight all the time. The devil, every inch we fight for, but there's a peace in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a comfort in it. There's a settlement to know that you're where you belong. You're where you're supposed to be. You're doing what you're supposed to do. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're what you are what God has called you to be. Oh, there's nothing greater in life. Amen. And again, I will say again, I think that's one of the greatest struggles humanity has today. Because they don't have that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Most people, I dare to say, most people in this world today do not have that. &gt;&gt; They don't know where they belong. They don't know who they are. They don't know peace. They don't know comfort. Not not the comforts of having money and a nice bed to sleep in, but I mean the comfort of your spirit &gt;&gt; to realize that you are where you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are doing what you're supposed to do, what God what you were born and called to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's that rest. There's that peace, that comfort that's found only in our promised land. And our promised land is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's read it. Ephesians 1, we'll start with verse one here. Ephesians 1:1, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. So, you notice this isn't to just anybody. This isn't just to the world. This is this is on this is to the saints at Ephesus and the faithful. Hello. Anybody? Am I talking to anybody in here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Now, we'll talk about that heavenly places in a minute and recognizing what that heavenly places are. Heavenly places that bless us all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. again, chosen, adopted, elected of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved, in whom we have, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. What? His riches of the riches of his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. having made known unto us the mystery of his will. So the mystery of it has now been made known. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not a mystery anymore. Not to those that have believed. You get again go back to the Paul's introduction. Amen. This isn't to just anybody. This is only to the faithful in Christ Jesus. made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself. No wonder brother Bam could say the bride was will have thus sayeth the Lord or keep still. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she's she knows the mystery of his will. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained obtained an inheritance an inheritance. Praise the Lord. Amen. Sound a little familiar? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have obtained an inheritance. Now that inheritance belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. When you obtain something, that means you get it. It's yours. Belongs to you. an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, in whom al uh in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of what? promise. What was our promise? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's our promise. That's our promised land. That is our Canaan. Amen. Is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That is our position that we have in the body of Christ, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. Now, look here. Let me read this quote real quick. Adoption number one 5:1560 he says now the book of Ephesians now the whole book not just the first chapter of first 14 verses we just read you read the whole chapter the whole verse excuse me the whole book speaks on that uh of that adoption. Amen. Especially uh in parts of chapter 2 and three, you can read where it talks about uh who we are in him and our position and being placed in that body. But now the book of Ephesians, brother Brandham said, placed us positionally in Christ. The book of Ephesians &gt;&gt; placed us positionally in Christ. What they was in the holy land. We are placed not in the holy land but in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's our promise. That's our promised land. &gt;&gt; Not heaven. Again, that's where we're going to. Amen. That is where we uh will ultimately end up as also a promise that God gave us. But in in retrospect or in in in prospect of what the Old Testament is to the New Testament or what the children of Israel were to us today is that promised land is their natural land is our spiritual land. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost and again the representation of of all that they garnered all that they had in that land we have in ours. Amen. When we get to heaven there won't be struggles &gt;&gt; there won't be fights. There won't be uh uh uh having to fight for every inch of ground. There there won't be there won't be any more death. Uh there won't be any more sorrows, babies born, ambulance sirens or hospitals built or governments to go there. Nothing of the world. None of that will be there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's a whole different another echelon of promised land to us. But our promised land now here is the Holy Ghost. We are not placed in the holy land but in the Holy Ghost. Let us read. He said he talked about the the perfect church. Now, amen. Now we read through where it spoke of this heavenly places and heavenly places if you look here uh in Ephesians specifically speaks of in uh the first chapter 3rd verse 1 chapter 20th verse which we didn't get down that far second chapter 6th verse 3rd chapter 10th verse it speaks on heavenly places &gt;&gt; why because that's the book of Ephesians and the placement of the body of the people of us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. This heavenly places is the places that we are that is our calling. &gt;&gt; It is it is where we are to dwell. Christ the mystery God revealed. He said all right that's uh that's the ones he's talking to. Uh that ain't address he talk about outside world. Uh this is to you the gre faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you. Peace from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Now brother Bram says whereabouts in heavenly places in Christ. Praise the Lord. Heavenly places. Oh, he says how I wish I had time. Here I've got it marked here in my Bible about heavenly places. What is heavenly places? Listen real close now. heavenly places. Of course, you you could imagine just the phrase or the couple of words heavenly places garers up all kinds of imaginative things that you think of of perfection and and goodness and uh no sickness and all the things that you think of when you think of heavenly places. Sounds like this uh beautiful celestial type uh place of perfect harmony and peace and amen. But look what he talks about heavenly places and and what a place that that is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be in heavenly places of Christ. Heavenly places. All wish had time. Got it. It marked my Bible about heavenly places. What is heavenly places? Heavenly places just for a moment is the believer's position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The believer's position in Christ. Not your pos not being in Christ, but your position in Christ. The believer's position in Christ, where the believer stands in Christ is heavenly places. That's what he's telling us. Those heavenly places that he's talking about that we just read in the third verse. Amen. When it says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." 120. which he had wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand where in the heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now there's uh uh different thoughts and ideas of heavenly places. But what brother Badam is talking about is our position. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our position in Christ. What Ephesians Paul is re referencing. Of course, we know that the Ephesians church was more spiritual church or more spiritually advanced church. So, brother, so Paul spoke to them in spiritual revelations and spiritual truths to in I guess you'd say, I kind of hate this phrase, but in the deepness of the word &gt;&gt; um to to help them see more than what he could with the Corinthians. &gt;&gt; So, the placement that they have here and see what that placement is. Amen. Now look in uh the purpose. Look at our purpose. We have a purpose. Verse 9 and 11 gives us a purpose. Amen. Nine. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure. We had purposed in himself which he had purposed in himself. In whom 11th verse now also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him. Praise the Lord. That's our purpose. We've been predestined. God has given us. God has revealed to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. predestinated because we're predestinated in him. As he as Paul speaks on predestination, which a lot of nominal churches I know of don't even really believe in predestination. Uh a lot of times uh I I've come to find out I'll say this real quick. I've come to find out that it seems like when people have a hard time living it or or uh uh explaining it, they just discard it &gt;&gt; or don't believe it or or push it off somehow. Amen. And a lot of times that's the truth. If you can't produce it, if you can't live it, if you can't explain it, if a person can't legitimately explain predestination, which to me is very simple, but if they can't, they just say, well, you know, it doesn't exist or he meant something different or something like that. But predestination is an extremely important word in our understanding of the scripture and belief of God. &gt;&gt; If there's no predestination, then how do you have an infinite God? &gt;&gt; Right? You can't have a God that is all knowing, infinite without having a God of predestination, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and people say, "Well, you know, you're like puppets on puppet strings." No, no, no. Predestination does not do away with with a free will. &gt;&gt; Not at all. Amen. God just happened to predestined and know who you were and what you would do, where you would go, how you would act, what you would say because he's all knowing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He knows the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he predestined verse four as we according as he had chosen us. Chosen. Now remember that's a part of our adoption. That's our election. Chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. What is that? That's predestination. before the foundation of the world is predestination. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You were predestined. Then he goes on the fifth verse and says, "Having predestinated us, having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been predestined to fulfill the position that God has called us to. No wonder there's such peace in living in that position. &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder there's such comfort and and and and and peace in knowing you are where you belong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And no wonder there's so much turmoil if you don't know. &gt;&gt; If you don't realize or if you're where you're not supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And if you're in Jesus Christ, friend, you know that there's there's there's not a question about it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You you know you don't you don't say, "Well, I wonder if could this be it. It's it's God speaking to you. It's God's Holy Spirit moving inside you to show you this is who you are. This is where you belong. This is what I predestined you to. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you know that. &gt;&gt; And it comes up. Does this Does the devil bring discouragement? Of course he does. &gt;&gt; Does he bring darkness and dreiness and discouragement? Of course he does. &gt;&gt; But you just stand up beside that. You take the word of God with a strong hand of faith. You just drive it through his heart. &gt;&gt; Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have no place here. &gt;&gt; You have no right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's who we are. &gt;&gt; Strong and of good courage. &gt;&gt; Predestined. Verse 11. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance by predestination. I know that's not what the scripture says, but we have received an inheritance being predestinated. Amen. By predestination, we have an inheritance. God promised the inheritance of the land to the forefathers of Joshua who had even gone on before he was rose up. But I I believe I haven't done the genealogy, but I I would they the ones that he promised it to had been passed away before Joshua even came over and was and was bringing forth the fulfillment of that. Amen. He was a part of it. But it was the it was the inheritance that had been given by predestination. God had already called it. So I don't care how much they fight, battle, war, carry on over there. Who picks who? &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; This side or that side, doesn't matter. Israel belongs to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel's God's people. Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't care what anybody else says. That's their land. God gave it to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's promised to them. And it don't matter what president or what government or what prime minister or what uh country says what about it doesn't matter belongs to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Period. That's God. &gt;&gt; It's about to be fulfilled in its fullness here pretty soon in my opinion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we are predestined. We received an inheritance by predestination. Predestined according to the purpose of him which we read a minute ago. a purpose having purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're placed we're placed by predestin we're placed through predestination, but we're placed there by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're placed there by his grace. Verse six, to the praise of the glory of his grace. Of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. Made us accepted in the beloved. How? By the glory of his grace. Yes. &gt;&gt; By the glory of his grace, we have been made accepted in the beloved. Verse seven, in whom we have redemption. Praise the Lord. And that itself speaks of God's grace. Redemption to bring back by back through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. And oh my, how his grace must be abundantly rich to have forgiven me of my sins. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You You feel the way you feel about it. Amen. I feel the way I feel about it. And the way I feel about it is I can't imagine somebody having enough grace to forgive everything I've done. But his abundance of grace has done that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Forgive of sin. Placing by predestination through adop through his grace or by his grace through predestination. He has placed us. Amen. Now we sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. What a wonderful place to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful place to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Knowing the position that God has placed us in. Knowing the placement where God has put us. Amen. What a place. What a time. Let me read read this scripture which will bring us into uh Lord willing our next uh the next part of this 1 Corinthians chapter 7. I just want to read this to get us to that place. I'm uh I've delivered my heart this morning, but I want to I want to read this uh and Lord willing the next next week we'll uh um we'll continue on with this thought of it. 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 17. 1 Corinthians 7:17. I encourage to if you haven't in a while, go back and read the entire book of Ephesians. Very short. It's only six chapters. &gt;&gt; Uh just go back and they're fairly short chapters at that. But uh that shouldn't be an excuse. Uh but go back and read that. Amen. Read through it. uh and uh see it's beautiful what what Christ what God spoke through Paul to us today. Amen. As it was, you know, some some 2,000 years ago, but as fresh to us today. 1 Corinthians now uh verse uh chapter 7 verse 17. But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called everyone, so let him walk. As God has called everyone, so let him walk, live, so let him walk. So and so ordained I in all churches. Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. In other words, whether circumcision or uncircumcision doesn't matter. Just do what God called you to do. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Right? Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. But the keeping of the commandment of God is something. I know I'm adding to that, but the keeping of God's command is something. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. Art thou called, being a servant? Care not for it. But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's free man. Like likewise also he that is called being free is Christ's servant. Ye are bought with a price. Be not ye the servants of men. Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherever he was called, wherever you are called, abide in that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we've said so many times. Amen. To abide to live in that place, to walk in that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. as God has commanded you. Doesn't matter what somebody else said, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what somebody else has tried to encourage you or tried to give you instruction or even prophesied over you. &gt;&gt; You go by what the Lord has showed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that a prophecy from a genuine prophecy from uh gift of the spirit is is is not legitimate. I believe that as much as anything, but if you're in contact with God, God will speak to you personally. God will show you personally, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that. And even even I've told you the story uh of me and when I first started ministering uh as young a minister or young a Christian as I was at the time. I mean, we're talking a couple of months after having received the Holy Ghost even, uh there was prophecies over me to minister and all, but uh and my pastor and my dad were like, "What's going on? What are you doing?" as waiting on the Lord. Well, the Lord spoke. I said, "I know that." I said, "But even as young a Christian as I was, I' I've always felt like if God wanted you to do something, especially something as important as ministering the gospel, which to me is um well, I it's hard for me to put into words how I covet that importance of that uh and staying on the word, but um he's he's going to speak to me. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's he's going to reveal it to me. He's going to show me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that I discounted or did not appreciate the uh the confirmations of prophecy because I believe they were of the Lord. Amen. And here 30 almost 30 Well, what is today? August the 3. Yesterday was my first sermon 34 years ago. &gt;&gt; Uh August 2nd, 1988 was the first message I ever preached. August 2nd. This August 3rd. So this is 34 years. Am I for 32 years? Whatever it is, I can't add or subtract, but I can I can preach the gospel by the grace of God. Um but but I took it as I knew it was of the Lord obviously. Amen. And I thank God for that. But you do as God tells you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As God leads you, as God shows you, as God reveals to you, that's what you do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

Now, after the bride's gone, this world will continue to go on. After the bride goes in the rapture, this world will continue to go on. &gt;&gt; But it'll go on into apostasy. It'll go on to an Armageddon. &gt;&gt; Yes. It'll go on to a total annihilation where the world completely uh uh is not obliterated but is is conformed and changed. &gt;&gt; Amen.
