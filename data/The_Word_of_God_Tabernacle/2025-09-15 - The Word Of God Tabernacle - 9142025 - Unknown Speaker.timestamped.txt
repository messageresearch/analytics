[13:35] we love you for that, Lord. We thank you
[13:38] for this time, this place. We thank you,
[13:41] Lord, to be able to come in from out of
[13:42] the world, Lord, and just worship and

[13:47] been quite a week we've gone through in
[13:49] this world, Lord, just in this country.

[13:55] in the time of trouble, need. And we

[14:00] Lord, to continue to strengthen us and
[14:02] root over us, watch us, and keep us,
[14:04] Lord, in your hands, Lord, in your
[14:07] perfect will and to be led by your
[14:09] spirit. Yes,
[14:10] &gt;&gt; we rebuke every demonic spirit that
[14:12] would try to hurt, hinder, and
[14:13] infiltrate this service in any way that
[14:16] Lord Jesus, you get the glory, honor,
[14:19] and praise for all that is said and done
[14:21] here today. Lord, we just pray you take
[14:24] control of this service, Lord, as we
[14:25] commit it into your hands. May your
[14:27] blessings, may your perfect will be done
[14:30] in this place today. We commit it to you
[14:32] now in the precious holy name of our

[25:07] couple prayer requests to mention today.
[25:09] Um, of course you want to continue with
[25:11] my brother and sister Pat in prayer.
[25:13] Brother Pat did have his surgery Friday
[25:16] on his eyes. Eyes were still blurry, but
[25:19] the surgery all went well. The
[25:20] procedure, I don't know if to call it
[25:22] surgery, but the procedure on his eyes
[25:24] went really well and thankful for that.
[25:27] Of course, I guess I haven't ever had
[25:29] cataracts removed, but uh I hear that
[25:32] after something and mess with your eye,
[25:34] you almost always have blurry vision. So
[25:37] his vision was a little blurry but doing
[25:39] good and uh just appreciate the Lord for
[25:42] that. And remember Sister Pat, she's
[25:43] supposed to have her hip replacement
[25:46] surgery tomorrow. Uh so please remember
[25:49] that in prayer. Uh it's uh it's even
[25:52] though it's I guess be considered
[25:55] somewhat routine anymore with
[25:57] replacement of body parts, knees and
[26:00] hips, uh is still a serious thing. and
[26:03] cut you open and take a piece of you out
[26:05] and put a artificial piece of something
[26:07] in there. Um, so let's please remember
[26:10] sister Pat in prayer. Just trust the
[26:12] Lord that uh that all will be well
[26:14] there. And also I got a text from Sister
[26:17] Sharia this morning said she woke up not
[26:19] feeling well. So please remember her.
[26:21] And of course she also asked for our
[26:24] prayer. Uh I guess he just seems to have
[26:27] chronic back problem. But we're just
[26:29] trusting the Lord to touch him and bring
[26:31] healing virtues down for our heart
[26:33] today.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Danny's not here with us.
[26:38] Remember, brother Thomas is tearing them
[26:40] out still. Amen. So, we're just thankful
[26:43] to be here in the house of the Lord
[26:45] today. Does anyone else have a request
[26:47] on your heart?
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. My wife will be having surgery
[26:54] October second. This is the final to
[26:58] take care of what needs she has
[27:01] concerning her breast cancer and breast
[27:04] restoration and so forth. This one's
[27:07] going to be a little bit more extensive.
[27:09] So, this just
[27:12] remember
[27:15] October second. So, remember that prayer
[27:18] for Dennis's wife. Anybody else?
[27:23] Have an unspoken close to your heart.
[27:26] Amen. We uh
[27:28] appreciate your prayers for me. I'm
[27:30] going out this afternoon again. Same
[27:32] travel time at all. Going back to
[27:33] California, the same site.
[27:36] Not quite
[27:38] ready for what we're supposed to do, but
[27:40] there's stuff for us to do. So, we're
[27:42] going back there. So, I appreciate your
[27:43] prayers for that. Amen. It's going to be
[27:45] warm again. Uh not humid though,
[27:47] thankfully that it'll be warm again. Uh
[27:50] also want to remember in prayer, we've
[27:52] had uh some very what I consider tragic
[27:57] things happen this week with the loss of
[27:59] life. Uh that young lady in Charlotte,
[28:01] North Carolina. I used to be proud to
[28:03] say I was from Charlotte. Of course,
[28:05] when I was in Charlotte, it was one it
[28:07] was voted uh when I lived there one of
[28:10] the safest, cleanest, nicest,
[28:12] friendliest towns you could want to move
[28:14] to. And people flock there, especially
[28:16] from the northeast. They they uh run out
[28:20] of work. They all came and they started
[28:22] heading for Florida and they stopped in
[28:23] Charlotte and they found out what a
[28:24] wonderful place it was and they stayed.
[28:26] Uh but uh now it's uh not that way
[28:30] anymore unfortunately. So kind of a
[28:33] shame to even say I'm from there. Mike
[28:35] is from there. He was born in Charlotte.
[28:37] My daughter was born in Charlotte. But
[28:39] anyway, uh that young lady lost her life
[28:42] there. Please remember that and those
[28:44] that were affected by that loss. Uh,
[28:47] also uh the passing and the murder of uh
[28:52] Charlie Kirk. Didn't know him really. I
[28:54] knew of him, heard his name. Never
[28:56] really watched until after he was
[28:58] murdered. And I've watched a lot of
[29:00] things uh that he has said and debates
[29:04] he's had. And uh I I would venture to
[29:07] say today without reservation, he was a
[29:10] godly man.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. and he spoke of Jesus Christ often.
[29:14] Pretty much almost almost any answer he
[29:18] gave to almost any question uh reverted
[29:20] back to Jesus Christ and God and the
[29:23] Bible and Christianity and love. Uh and
[29:27] unfortunately uh
[29:29] &gt;&gt; I guess a young man couldn't debate him
[29:32] in words, so he shot it and killed it.
[29:35] But uh I have some things I want to say
[29:38] about that. I've been in turmoil kind of
[29:41] decision of what to do today. Um, but I
[29:45] pray that you pray for me and when we
[29:47] get going, the Lord will just show me
[29:49] what to do.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Uh, because it's a it it's a time for
[29:54] the bride to wake up, saints.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; It is a time for the bride to wake up.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; She needs to the the the midnight cry
[30:02] has gone out.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the bride wakes up
[30:07] when the midnight cry goes out. So, the
[30:10] five wise ver virgins. So, anyway, um
[30:14] just please pray for that family uh and
[30:16] and a lot of people that feel loss at
[30:19] that uh at that murder, at the loss of
[30:22] that individual. Um so,
[30:26] it's kind of a bad place uh that we're
[30:29] in today. Um but the Lord knows. But
[30:34] anyway, far as our prayers, we're
[30:36] remembering in prayer that the Lord
[30:37] would just help his He had a wife and
[30:40] two young children. Uh so the Lord, he
[30:42] was only 31. So uh he was younger than
[30:45] my youngest. Actually, he was born in
[30:47] the same year as Tabitha, but he was
[30:49] younger. Uh because he hadn't had his
[30:53] birthday, but anyway. So please remember
[30:55] them in prayer if you would.
[30:57] So let's stand to our feet if we could.
[30:59] We'll take these knees to the Lord in
[31:00] prayer and ask for
[31:04] these.
[31:05] Lord Jesus, it's an honor once again to
[31:09] be in your house of worship. Lord,
[31:14] we know that it's time to examine our
[31:17] hearts daily.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; There's a cry that will soon come out.
[31:23] The dead in Christ will show themsself.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; And we'll be going home.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And Lord, I heard to prophet
[31:33] teach many times that you desire to pour
[31:38] your Holy Spirit in us more than what we
[31:41] desire to receive it. And Lord, if
[31:44] there's some that are even present this
[31:49] morning or listening on tape that lack
[31:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that's a
[31:57] prayer. And each and every believer is
[32:00] present here this morning that they'll
[32:02] call on your name. They'll ask you,
[32:05] Lord, to come in their heart, to take
[32:10] away all worldliness,
[32:12] &gt;&gt; to take away all sin.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[32:15] &gt;&gt; we know sin is pleasurable for a season,
[32:20] but when it's finished is death if they
[32:23] don't repent.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us to walk in the light.
[32:27] For you are the light, Father,
[32:30] &gt;&gt; to take our walk with you serious. Yes,
[32:34] Jesus.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; You promise in your word that he that
[32:36] has begun a good work will perform it in
[32:39] the name of Jesus Christ.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; And Lord, what is it with certain ones
[32:44] that they just don't want to receive the
[32:49] greatest gift you've given to mankind?
[32:53] It's your own spirit, the baptism of the
[32:56] Holy Ghost living in us, Father. Father,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; and Lord, there are needs this morning.
[33:04] We can't even begin to have the
[33:06] compassion
[33:08] and burden to pray for one another if
[33:12] your Holy Spirit isn't living in us.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes we pray with just empty
[33:20] words.
[33:22] Words that are not meaningful.
[33:26] We know that the word says eternal life
[33:29] is well your prophet said eternal life
[33:31] is living for others.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; And when we live for others, we look
[33:37] heaven in the face. Thank you.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; And Lord, our brother Pat who had
[33:43] surgery recently on his eyes. Lord
[33:47] cataract surgery. Lord may you continue
[33:50] to touch our brother.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus. May his eyesight be fully
[33:55] restored because you said in your word,
[33:59] "Whatever we should ask, believe we
[34:02] shall receive."
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; It's doubt that gets us to the place
[34:06] where we're defeated.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; But greater he is in us than he is in
[34:10] the world.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; We claim your promises, Lord. When you
[34:15] gave it to us, he says, "Reach out. My
[34:19] fountain is unlimited. It'll never dry.
[34:22] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; And Lord, our my wife who's be having
[34:27] surgery, Lord.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, may you guide the surgeon's hands.
[34:32] May all go well for your honor and for
[34:35] your glory.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Grant and God.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I can't remember all their
[34:40] prayer requests, but you heard them.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; You know what they are.
[34:45] You won't overlook anyone because
[34:48] everyone is equal and precious in your
[34:51] sight.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; May you come in the scene and minister
[34:55] to the needs of the ones that have uh
[35:00] brought forth a prayer request, an
[35:02] unspoken prayer request.
[35:05] Father, for you, we know that you want
[35:08] us to have a victorious life. If you
[35:11] want us to have a joy that's unspeakable
[35:16] and full of glory and we claim victory
[35:19] and we claim the each and every request
[35:22] for the ones that have need of something
[35:25] from you, Father.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And bless our pastor, Lord. He's going
[35:28] back. He It's a tough job for the weak
[35:32] when he works.
[35:34] Be with him and guide him and and safely
[35:37] to his destination. give him strength to
[35:40] make it through the weak. And above all,
[35:42] I know he's a light amongst his fellow
[35:47] workers, Father.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know gross darkness has
[35:51] come upon the world, but there's a
[35:54] bride.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; There's a real light, Father.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; May we continue to shine forth for your
[36:01] name's sake as Jesus Christ truly is the
[36:04] same yesterday and today and forever.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Your precious. Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; May we pray, Father, name of the Lord
[36:10] Jesus Christ.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You can be seated if you'd
[36:15] like.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:19] Praise the Lord.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; I want to turn over to Psalm number 51.
[36:25] In the song book, we have it on the
[36:26] screen, but Psalm number 51 in the book.
[36:30] Amen.
[36:31] I say that for those of you here don't
[36:33] know, but there are people who watch
[36:35] online that like have a song book and
[36:38] might follow and listen to the song
[36:39] service. So, I mention the names whe
[36:41] they have it. They might not can see the
[36:43] screen. I'm not sure if they can see the
[36:44] screen on the camera or not. You might
[36:47] see it. I don't know if it's jumpy or
[36:49] blurry, but anyway, song number 51 of
[36:52] the song book. Glory to his name. Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Let's see.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Down at the cross where myior
[37:04] died. Now where for cleansing from sin I
[37:09] cried.
[37:10] There to my heart was the blood of life.
[37:16] Gloryy to his name.
[37:20] Oh sing glory to his wonderful name.
[37:27] Glory to that matchless name.
[37:32] into my heart was the blood of blood.
[37:37] Glory to his name.
[37:42] Well, I am so gorgeously saved from
[37:48] Jesus so sweetly alive with him. There
[37:54] at the cross where he took me in. Glory
[38:00] to his name.
[38:03] I'm singing gloryy to his wonderful
[38:08] name. Glory to that matchless name.
[38:15] To my heart goes the blood of
[38:20] glory to his name.
[38:25] Well, oh precious fountain that sees
[38:28] from sin.
[38:30] I am so glad I have entered in there.
[38:36] Jesus saves me and keeps me clean. Glory
[38:42] to his name.
[38:45] Oh, singing glory to his wonderful name.
[38:51] Glory to that fashionless name.
[38:56] There to my heart was the blood of God.
[39:02] Glory to his name.
[39:06] Welcome to this mountain so riches.
[39:12] Cast out your soul at the Savior's feet.
[39:18] launch into the bee.
[39:23] Glory to his name.
[39:27] I'm singing glory to his wonderful name.
[39:33] Glory to that matchless name.
[39:38] And to my heart was the blood of God.
[39:44] Glory to his name.
[39:48] I'm singing all glory to his wonderful
[39:52] name.
[39:54] Glory to that matchless name.
[39:59] There my heart was the blood of God.
[40:04] Glory to his name.
[40:10] Praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank
[40:13] you Lord God. Glory to that precious
[40:16] name. The name of Jesus. Amen. That
[40:20] precious, wonderful name. That name
[40:22] Jesus.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but every
[40:26] time I say it, it just makes me feel
[40:28] good.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; I just like saying Jesus. It just makes
[40:32] you feel good. And so it makes me feel
[40:34] good inside. Every time I call that
[40:36] precious name,
[40:38] &gt;&gt; that name Jesus, it means so much.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. First time that name was spoke, a
[40:44] baby came back to life. That's right.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; That ought to tell you something right
[40:47] there. Amen. Hallelujah. I tell you, it
[40:50] brings life in me. It seems like every
[40:52] time I say it, too. Jesus. Amen.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. The name of Jesus.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Glory to God.
[41:02] Amen. You love him today?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all stand.
[41:07] Does anyone have a testimony or
[41:09] something on your heart you'd like to
[41:11] thank the Lord Jesus for?
[41:15] &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord for his fil.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Anyone else?
[41:38] Amen. Wonderful. Praise the Lord. Look
[41:41] at that heart. That's just man.
[41:46] Like brother Dennis prayed, you have a
[41:48] heart for others so that they can see
[41:50] Jesus. Amen. Like like we do.
[41:54] She said, "That's just beautiful."
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, that's just just a a
[41:59] real heart for wanting someone to see
[42:02] Jesus like you do.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; That's uh that that's something that the
[42:07] world just can't match today, saints.
[42:09] They just don't know anything about
[42:12] &gt;&gt; being able to live for others and having
[42:14] that in your heart. God bless you.
[42:16] That's wonderful.
[42:23] So I had to
[42:29] see
[42:33] the words.
[42:39] So what I did is I walked
[42:42] to his door and Ius
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:11] But God is still faithful.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; God is still true.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Still right.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; I couldn't hear her testimony.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; She uh uh in her job there was a lady
[43:26] had called out sick. So she was taking
[43:29] care of a I guess a wing or an area and
[43:32] a man who was in there uh was a patient
[43:36] very foul mouth and she sat outside his
[43:40] door in Jesus name for him to
[43:43] &gt;&gt; stop that and she went in the door and
[43:46] he couldn't speak.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; He couldn't talk.
[43:50] So, I hope I got that from the distance.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Didn't know what to say. Walked in and
[44:03] praise the Lord.
[44:06] Do that every morning on the job, too.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Guys, I'm with they they can be they can
[44:13] be foulmouthed, but they're not like
[44:16] what you're talking about. They're
[44:18] they're not constant all the time.
[44:20] every other word. So,
[44:24] it's a little more tolerable. It's way
[44:25] more tolerable when they're someplace
[44:27] else and I'm doing something else. So,
[44:29] but anyway, Lord knows. Amen.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Power of prayer. God is good, isn't he?
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Let's go
[44:38] over to u I'm going to go ahead and uh
[44:40] delve into this today.
[44:43] Um maybe the Lord willing, we'll see how
[44:47] the Lord brings this up. He gave me
[44:50] uh several scripture things to speak on.
[44:54] Uh I want to if if I could even before
[44:57] we get to that point, uh I want to turn
[45:00] your attention not to turn to right now,
[45:02] but turn your attention uh maybe even
[45:05] through the week at uh Matthew chapter
[45:08] 25. Uh I'm not saying turn to that now.
[45:11] That's not what we're going to talk
[45:13] about right now. But um Matthew 25 and
[45:17] the uh the uh exhortation that we got
[45:21] from the prophet of God and from the
[45:24] scripture. Of course, he takes it from
[45:25] the scripture that to watch out when you
[45:28] start seeing uh the nominal Christians
[45:31] going after that oil. Amen. When those
[45:34] nominal Christians are starting to go
[45:36] after that oil, you know that's when God
[45:39] takes his bride home.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's about to be an
[45:45] explosion in this country, even in this
[45:47] world. I heard in the UK and London. It
[45:50] was hundreds of thousands of people that
[45:52] turned out in honor of Charlie Kirk and
[45:54] honestly was just a man. But uh but the
[45:58] but the whole fervor of this is uh
[46:01] Christ and the word and being a
[46:03] Christian and um and when when that
[46:08] great of a fervor is washing through
[46:11] because we know there's not going to be
[46:13] a revival. The revival is over. bride.
[46:16] The only revival is the bride's revival,
[46:18] right?
[46:19] &gt;&gt; As far as a nationwide sweeping revival,
[46:22] that is not going to happen. And you see
[46:24] even in other countries outside of this
[46:27] nation that
[46:28] &gt;&gt; that uh is starting to gain a fervor.
[46:32] And
[46:33] &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest with you, I think
[46:34] his death is going to uh
[46:38] energize
[46:40] uh energize that in people uh more and
[46:44] more. So, um, I I think Matthew 25 is a
[46:49] is a good scripture to learn to to look
[46:52] into to see what's about to happen and
[46:54] what's going on in the world today.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. What what is happening uh in the
[47:00] world. In fact, let's go um I want to
[47:03] turn in the scripture to second Peter
[47:08] uh second Peter
[47:13] and I want to read a couple of verses of
[47:15] scripture.
[47:18] This uh today probably won't be be very
[47:22] lengthy but I am fully depending on the
[47:24] Lord to speak whatever he wants to say
[47:27] today.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I have a couple of scriptures I
[47:31] want to read, but I just have to be
[47:33] honest since uh since some of these
[47:35] things has been happening. Uh it's just
[47:38] been boiling in my spirit and uh things
[47:41] that the Lord has been pointing out,
[47:43] I've just tried to pay attention to and
[47:45] um so I trust that whatever he wants to
[47:49] say today, it's it's it's up to him. I
[47:52] heard I heard again I I don't mean to
[47:55] keep giving accolades to uh to Charlie,
[47:58] but um I heard that a good friend of his
[48:05] said every time he went out to speak in
[48:08] front of people, which he had a lot of
[48:10] interaction on college campuses and
[48:12] stuff, he'd have them come and ask
[48:13] questions and just open debate. Uh he
[48:16] said every time before he came out to
[48:18] speak, he would pray and ask God to give
[48:22] him the words to say that he might be
[48:24] able to help somebody in some way turn
[48:26] to Christ. And you know, I think to
[48:30] myself, uh that's the same prayer I have
[48:34] when I come here
[48:36] every time we have service. So uh it
[48:39] means a lot to understand and know that
[48:41] uh your words have purpose. They have
[48:43] meaning. Uh there's a reason that God
[48:45] puts people in your lives. There's a
[48:47] reason God gives you gifts and things
[48:49] for you to be able to accomplish. So
[48:51] this isn't to all together outside of
[48:54] our uh our subject lately, which has
[48:57] been on adoption because that purpose,
[48:59] that point, that reason uh falls on
[49:02] every one of us. Uh like Madison uh in
[49:05] and her testimony to be able to speak to
[49:08] people and get in contact that she
[49:10] hadn't in a long time to be able to help
[49:12] share Christ. It just
[49:14] &gt;&gt; uh is just tremendous. Uh but um uh I I
[49:19] I want us I want to start today with
[49:21] this scripture reading uh in second
[49:24] Peter chapter 3. But before we do, let's
[49:26] just bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[49:28] Lord Jesus, God, we're just here at your
[49:31] beckoning. We're here, God, to do your
[49:34] will. Whatever you'd have for us today,
[49:36] God, it's in your hands. Lord, we u
[49:39] we're just depending on you as always
[49:41] and trusting you and believing, Father,
[49:43] that you are taking complete control of
[49:46] this service
[49:47] &gt;&gt; and speaking to us as you always will
[49:50] know that your word will not return
[49:52] void.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; But accomplish in each one of us that
[49:56] that you sent it forth for. Lord, we
[49:59] just commit ourselves to you. I pray
[50:01] again. Lord, as I say here now, as I
[50:04] just said to the congregation, Lord,
[50:07] shut my lips to anything that I should
[50:09] not say, open them, Lord, and freely
[50:12] speak through these lips whatever you'd
[50:14] have for us to hear today.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; And may you get the glory and the praise
[50:18] for it all. We commit this service to
[50:20] you now on the remaining part of it. In
[50:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[50:23] pray. Amen. Second Peter 3:1.
[50:28] This second epistle, beloved, I now
[50:30] write unto you in both which I stir up
[50:31] your pure minds by the way of
[50:33] remembrance, that uh that ye may be
[50:36] mindful of the words which were spoken
[50:38] before by the holy prophets and the
[50:40] commandments of us apostles of the Lord
[50:42] uh of the Lord and Savior, knowing this
[50:45] first, that there shall come in the last
[50:47] days scoffers walking after their own
[50:51] lusts, and saying, "Where is the promise
[50:53] of his coming? For since the fathers
[50:55] fell asleep, all things continue as they
[50:57] were from the beginning of the creation.
[50:59] You can be seated if you like.
[51:04] Pardon me.
[51:11] Notice here Peter
[51:14] is first of all making sure that he's
[51:17] giving an exhortation to the people of
[51:19] something that they would already know.
[51:23] uh stirring up their minds by the way of
[51:26] remembrance, stirring them up by
[51:29] remembrance. You know, sometimes as
[51:31] humans uh things kind of get pushed off
[51:34] to the side, things kind of get pushed
[51:36] into the back of our minds. And you
[51:38] know, today in this age of uh technology
[51:41] and all, we're bombarded with voices.
[51:44] We're bombarded with words. We're
[51:46] bombarded with information all the time,
[51:50] continuously coming into our into our
[51:52] minds, into our brains, into our ears,
[51:56] uh creating all kinds of things,
[51:58] emotions and feelings and things that
[52:00] happen in our in our uh uh in our bodies
[52:03] and our spirits uh that uh that have an
[52:08] effect on our lives. So Peter wanted to
[52:11] make sure to uh that they understood
[52:13] that this exhortation was something to
[52:15] stir up their minds. Bring back take
[52:18] back from the far back regions of their
[52:21] minds and throw it back up into the
[52:23] forefront. I know that's very carnal and
[52:25] hor probably horribly wrong as far as if
[52:28] you talk to a
[52:30] someone who knows the brain, but uh in
[52:33] my poor way of explaining it, that's all
[52:35] I know to say. You take that from the
[52:37] way that's in the back far reaches.
[52:38] Maybe things you've forgotten, things
[52:40] that may not have been. And we stir them
[52:42] up by bringing into remembrance those
[52:45] things because those things are as
[52:47] important as anything else that we know,
[52:49] anything else that we've heard, anything
[52:51] else that we've ever been a part of. uh
[52:53] are those things that the that we know
[52:56] that has come to us through the word
[52:58] through as as well Peter said word
[53:01] mindful of the words that were before us
[53:04] brought before us by the holy prophets.
[53:06] Amen. The word of God we just know it as
[53:08] the word of God. Of course those that
[53:10] were men that were moved by the Holy
[53:12] Ghost to write this word uh to bring
[53:14] that word to us so many times uh gets uh
[53:18] gets pushed back but it's brought to our
[53:20] remembrance. And the remembrance he's
[53:22] wanting to bring to them now is knowing
[53:26] knowing Amen. First, knowing this first
[53:31] that there shall come in the last days.
[53:33] Now, Peter uh uh the prophets here
[53:36] understood a good bit about what the
[53:38] last days were. If you read through uh
[53:41] Paul's writings even into revelation
[53:43] what Peter said, what John said, what
[53:45] Jude said.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Um is all those things that bring back
[53:49] in or bring forward into a point that we
[53:52] are now living in which is the last
[53:54] days.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Uh I've said before and I will say again
[53:58] that to me I believe this is the last of
[54:01] the last days.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, I believe this is the last
[54:04] moment of the last day of the last days.
[54:07] Uh I don't know how much closer we can
[54:10] bring that up to a realization to us,
[54:12] but uh as Peter said today, something
[54:16] again has been stirring in me to bring
[54:18] to your remembrance uh things that we
[54:21] know what the scripture says, but bring
[54:24] into remembrance what we're what the day
[54:26] that we're living, the hour that we're
[54:28] living, the time that we're living, and
[54:29] these are the last days. And he's
[54:32] wanting to remind us that it has been
[54:35] told through the scripture that in this
[54:37] last days that there would be scoffers.
[54:40] Amen. People that scoff at the word.
[54:43] People that would scoff at Christians.
[54:46] People that would scoff at your beliefs.
[54:48] Uh uh walking after their own lusts.
[54:53] Amen. So they're scoffing at you, but
[54:56] they're walking after their own lusts.
[54:59] It comes a time where it's a very
[55:00] pitiful place to where uh a a group of
[55:05] people and I will say a group of people
[55:07] because there's it seems to be to me
[55:10] that there's probably been a stirring of
[55:13] maybe a millions of people I hate to say
[55:16] it that way because I hope that's not
[55:17] true that actually celebrate
[55:21] uh this poor girl getting killed on that
[55:23] trail that rail system in Charlotte that
[55:27] celebrated uh Charlie Kirk getting
[55:29] murdered. uh people that I've heard of
[55:32] and seen and and even people in
[55:35] prominent positions, people of
[55:37] authority, people who are even at
[55:39] schools teaching young people, people
[55:42] that are in uh positions of of uh of
[55:46] government and have a a position to be
[55:49] able to make and write laws and to be
[55:53] able to celebrate this or somehow
[55:57] blame a very innocent girl for her own
[55:59] murder. murder or an innocent man for
[56:02] his own murder. I I hate to think that
[56:05] there's that many people out there that
[56:07] feel that way,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; but we do know that in the last days
[56:10] there will be scoffers. Now, that we
[56:13] talk about in the religious realm. So,
[56:14] that kind of puts uh uh the greater
[56:17] emphasis on the one that espoused
[56:19] Christianity, but uh the the scoffers,
[56:23] but they're walking after their own
[56:25] lusts. So, what are their own lusts
[56:27] there? Well, a lot of their lusts are to
[56:31] get rid of you,
[56:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Uh, one of their greatest lust. Now, I
[56:35] know when people talk about lust, they
[56:37] talk about man and a woman or man on man
[56:39] or whatever the filthiness, but uh, but
[56:42] there is a greater lust than that. U,
[56:45] there's a lust of murder. There's a lust
[56:48] of vengeance. There's a lust of uh, of
[56:51] of really getting rid of you. Uh there's
[56:55] people out there that believe that they
[56:57] are justified. The Bible says they would
[56:59] be uh they would be thinking they're
[57:01] doing the right thing by killing you,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Uh and and sadly, that's where humanity
[57:07] has come. But I want us to focus on
[57:10] understanding that yes, we've known that
[57:14] this was going to happen. But I want us
[57:16] to focus this morning to the
[57:18] understanding that friends, we're not
[57:19] looking at something to come. We're
[57:21] looking at something that's here. and
[57:24] acknowledge it and recognize it and call
[57:27] it out for what it is.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; It's the devil.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's two spirits working in
[57:33] this world today. And let me tell you,
[57:36] evil in this world, Satan's in. Now,
[57:38] remember, this is not God's economy,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; We're pilgrims and strangers. Uhhuh.
[57:44] Charlie was a pilgrim and a stranger. As
[57:46] a Christian, we're all as Christians,
[57:48] pilgrims and strangers. This is not our
[57:51] economy. This is not God's economy. This
[57:54] is Satan's Eden. This world went into
[57:57] the hands of Satan. And this economy
[58:00] belongs to him. Now, the earth, the
[58:02] rightful place of the earth itself,
[58:05] which is God's creation, belongs to him
[58:07] again. Amen. And he's going to take care
[58:10] of that one day. We know. But in this
[58:12] economy that we live, there's those two
[58:15] spirits that are working, saints. And
[58:17] the evil in this world is growing
[58:19] greater and greater exponentially. We
[58:22] talked about a minute ago where the
[58:24] spirit of God is moving among people and
[58:27] even the nominals out there are feeling
[58:29] that move and feeling that fervor and
[58:31] feeling that uh that that spirit moving
[58:34] and they see what's going on and they
[58:36] want to do something to combat that.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we recognize that the evil the
[58:42] forces of evil in this world are gaining
[58:45] such ground. Amen. And uh as much as you
[58:50] would say the the one side is not uh is
[58:55] not violent. Uh the one side that's the
[58:58] Christian, that's the nominal, that's
[59:00] the going after that oil, the ones
[59:02] that's desiring to live a Christian life
[59:04] and to spread the gospel. These people
[59:06] are not violent,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; right? But you got to understand the
[59:09] other side is very violent,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; They are their hatred has burned so hot
[59:16] that they celebrate a human life being
[59:19] taken. Human life, human life has become
[59:23] so devalued today. And the scripture
[59:25] said it would. Well, I got another
[59:27] scripture I want to read. But human life
[59:29] has become so devalued today that people
[59:33] will celebrate when someone else is
[59:35] murdered or killed. I don't care who it
[59:38] is. I I don't care how much you
[59:40] disagree. I don't I even Look, I
[59:43] disagree with the president, Donald
[59:46] Trump. I I I like him as a president. I
[59:49] think he's a great president. Uh I think
[59:51] he's evolved into a decent man. I think
[59:53] he was at one time not very much a very
[59:56] good man, but uh he's been a I think I
[59:59] believe a great president. But I
[1:00:00] disagree with him wholeheartedly when he
[1:00:03] come out asking for the death penalty
[1:00:05] for this young man. I do not agree in
[1:00:07] the death penalty.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham did not agree
[1:00:10] with the death penalty.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Uh that's the taking of a life and
[1:00:14] that's not up to you to do.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; It's not up for us to do as a
[1:00:17] government. Amen. It's not up for us to
[1:00:19] do as a judicial system to take another
[1:00:22] person's life. We still do it. Amen. And
[1:00:26] as much as that is wrong, I hate the
[1:00:28] thought of somebody like that living off
[1:00:30] of my tax dollars for the next 50 years.
[1:00:32] But uh it is wrong to take life
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; value life. Life is so precious. Brother
[1:00:40] Ram said life is so precious. God
[1:00:42] records every one of them in a book.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Even though they weren't ones that were
[1:00:47] to be predestined in his mind in the
[1:00:50] Lamb's book of life. But he records
[1:00:52] every life. Everyone that's born. That's
[1:00:55] how precious life is to God. Every every
[1:00:58] person has a soul that's worth 10
[1:01:01] million worlds.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how to devalue that down to
[1:01:07] something that you can just take as
[1:01:09] target practice is beyond me. I I I I
[1:01:13] just don't get it. I hear a lot of
[1:01:15] people screaming and yelling about
[1:01:17] taking guns out of people's hands. Once
[1:01:19] you take the guns out of people's you
[1:01:20] can't Well, first of all, you'll never
[1:01:22] do it
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; right. uh if you take the guns out of
[1:01:25] the uh respectable law-abiding people,
[1:01:28] all the people that have guns are the
[1:01:29] crooks, criminals, and murderers,
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But you it won't happen. You can't do
[1:01:33] it. But if you were to do it, you become
[1:01:35] you become a citizenry that is
[1:01:38] defenseless. Amen. Against any crooked
[1:01:42] government or whatever that would want
[1:01:43] to rise up. But they want to take all
[1:01:45] this. But that's not the problem. The
[1:01:48] problem is that I've had guns my entire
[1:01:50] life. And I'm sorry if this gets a
[1:01:52] little political. I I don't think it
[1:01:54] should because we're talking about life
[1:01:56] in the word, right?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; But I've had guns my whole life. Since I
[1:02:00] was a little boy, I've had guns my whole
[1:02:03] life. Not one of my guns has ever hurt
[1:02:06] anybody except maybe me when I was a
[1:02:09] little kid. Tried to shoot it and
[1:02:10] bruised my shoulder. I guess that hurt
[1:02:12] me. But none of my guns have ever killed
[1:02:15] anybody. Nobody. I still got guns today.
[1:02:18] They've never killed anybody. Right.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're in my hands.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Problem is not the gun. The
[1:02:25] problem's a person's heart. How if you
[1:02:27] take all the guns out, how are you going
[1:02:29] to take the evil out of people's hearts?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've had people that are right
[1:02:33] that are that are actually relatives of
[1:02:35] mine. I hate guns. They say, "Well, I
[1:02:38] hate guns, too." In the hands of a
[1:02:41] wicked, evil person.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I hate a car in the hands of a wicked
[1:02:47] person. I hate a knife in the hands of a
[1:02:50] wicked person. I hate a bomb in the
[1:02:54] hands of a wicked person. I I hate all
[1:02:56] the chemicals that a person can use to
[1:02:58] make a bomb in the hands of a wicked
[1:03:01] person. I hate all this stuff in the
[1:03:03] hands of a wicked person. A person we've
[1:03:06] had people that push others out on the
[1:03:09] uh uh uh out on the to the subway rails
[1:03:12] for the subway to run over them, kill
[1:03:14] them. We was that a gun? We've had
[1:03:18] people drive their cars through parades,
[1:03:21] kill six, eight, ten people.
[1:03:24] We've had people, this this uh young guy
[1:03:27] the other day plunged that knife in the
[1:03:29] neck of that poor girl. That wasn't a
[1:03:31] gun, but it was evil.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Wickedness. And that's the whole point
[1:03:37] I'm making. It's the wickedness. It's
[1:03:40] the evil that's taking over this that
[1:03:42] this world and it's continuing to and it
[1:03:45] will continue to because again remember
[1:03:47] I'm not trying to paint a bleak picture
[1:03:50] of the world that we live in saints but
[1:03:52] we know what reality is as Christians.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And we know before the sixth seal before
[1:03:57] the tribulation sets in in Armageddon
[1:04:00] the bride will be gone.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride will be gone. But the
[1:04:05] evil is starting to manifold itself more
[1:04:08] and more all the time. And
[1:04:10] unfortunately, it seems like the
[1:04:12] greatest indoctrinated group is becoming
[1:04:15] the young people.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; And if this generation is getting to
[1:04:18] that point, what do you think the next
[1:04:19] one's going to be?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; If they're getting more and more
[1:04:22] indoctrinated
[1:04:24] away from God, whatever else the
[1:04:27] indoctrination
[1:04:29] takes them to, murder, whatever, hatred,
[1:04:31] that's one thing. but taking them away
[1:04:33] from God. And see, people want to talk
[1:04:36] about I hear this word root causes all
[1:04:38] the time. Root causes. We want to have
[1:04:40] root causes. Let's find root cause.
[1:04:41] Let's go to the root cause. Let's get
[1:04:42] the root cause of what the problem is.
[1:04:44] And they never find what the root cause.
[1:04:46] You know what the root cause is? We
[1:04:48] turned our back on God.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; That's what the root cause is. Root
[1:04:52] cause is when you turn your back on
[1:04:54] Jesus Christ, there's nothing left but
[1:04:56] death.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what they've done.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Right. When you turn your back on God,
[1:05:01] there's nothing left. And that's what
[1:05:03] humanity has done. That's what this
[1:05:05] country has done. So where are we at
[1:05:08] today? We're living in a place where
[1:05:10] yes, you've got this great group of
[1:05:12] people that again, I'll call them
[1:05:15] nominal Christian. I don't know every
[1:05:17] one of them. I don't know their place. I
[1:05:18] don't know their position. This may be a
[1:05:20] stirring. You know what? This could be a
[1:05:23] stirring that's going on that's just
[1:05:25] getting started to me a after this last
[1:05:29] murder. I think it's just getting
[1:05:31] started. This stirring could be the
[1:05:33] thing that drives some people to it. It
[1:05:37] might drive the last seed in,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know what happens when that
[1:05:43] last seed comes in.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; The bride goes home.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it could be
[1:05:49] something that actually even drives the
[1:05:51] last seed in that is a part of the bride
[1:05:54] to get to that place. I mean when I was
[1:05:56] a kid we were Baptists. I don't know
[1:05:59] what you were what religion or if you
[1:06:01] were atheists but when I was a kid we
[1:06:04] were Baptists. So I personally myself uh
[1:06:08] I was young very young but came out of
[1:06:10] that denomination.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you did but everybody
[1:06:14] starts somewhere. So we don't know that
[1:06:17] last person. It could be that last seed.
[1:06:20] This this right now could be the thing
[1:06:22] that brings that last seed in.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; We don't know.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the greater work I see I see
[1:06:28] happening is this that I again call
[1:06:31] nominal stirring up to the place that
[1:06:34] they're going. And when and we know that
[1:06:37] the scripture says when they go after
[1:06:38] that that's when the bridegroom comes.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when the bridegroom comes.
[1:06:43] And that's uh a a word uh the scripture
[1:06:48] that I do want to read that to us too.
[1:06:50] But I want to read one more scripture
[1:06:51] before we get to that one.
[1:06:54] Uh in second Timothy
[1:07:00] in 2 Timothy chapter 3 is a very
[1:07:03] familiar scripture reading I'm sure to
[1:07:05] all of us.
[1:07:14] Amen. Second Timothy 3 verse one. This
[1:07:18] know also that in the last days here we
[1:07:21] go again saying the last days. We
[1:07:25] acknowledge that, right? We we accept
[1:07:28] that. We believe that. We know that
[1:07:30] that's talking to us.
[1:07:34] Perilous time shall come. You know what
[1:07:36] perilous means?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Dangerous. Amen. Savagery
[1:07:42] times, hatred,
[1:07:45] perilous times, un un uh unthinkable,
[1:07:49] unknowable. Um uh perilous is is uh
[1:07:53] unstable.
[1:07:54] Amen. Dangerous. Savage. You know what a
[1:07:57] savage is? A savage is a person that is
[1:08:00] is brutal and vicious.
[1:08:03] Now, if you want to think about brutal
[1:08:05] and vicious, look at what happened to
[1:08:07] just a couple in couple instances just
[1:08:09] this week that we know of
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; that we saw publicized, videoed. Amen.
[1:08:15] Not not to mention some of the others in
[1:08:18] a lot of these high crime cities that
[1:08:20] goes on all the time. Murders every
[1:08:23] week, every weekend.
[1:08:26] Killings, murders every week. But look
[1:08:30] at this this couple of times. savages. I
[1:08:34] mean, who gets up behind a little
[1:08:36] defenseless girl behind her and from
[1:08:39] behind plunges a knife into her neck?
[1:08:44] And who else
[1:08:46] will sit there? I mean, how bad can it
[1:08:49] be after watching blood gushing out of
[1:08:52] this girl's neck that you can sit there
[1:08:54] and do nothing,
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; What day are we living, saints?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:01] What is going on in this world? What is
[1:09:04] happening to people? Perilous times,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; It's perilous times. That person
[1:09:09] probably didn't want to get up because
[1:09:10] they were afraid it might happen to
[1:09:12] them. Dangerous, savagery, brutal,
[1:09:17] dangerous, vicious people. Amen. That's
[1:09:21] why you must have the shield of God
[1:09:24] around you at all times.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watching over you. But who does
[1:09:28] that? I who climbs up on a roof and just
[1:09:31] for no re basically what we can tell no
[1:09:34] reason at all just because he disagreed
[1:09:36] with it. You know, I mean I if we shoot
[1:09:41] people we disagree with I might as well
[1:09:42] shoot myself now because I disagree with
[1:09:44] myself fairly often.
[1:09:46] Amen. I do stuff and I look back and I
[1:09:48] think why in the world would you do
[1:09:49] that? That didn't make any sense. Why
[1:09:51] did you say that? I mean why did you
[1:09:53] think that I do that to myself much less
[1:09:55] other people?
[1:09:58] I might as well kill myself. Now, if
[1:10:00] you're going to shoot if you're going to
[1:10:02] shoot people you disagree with, we're
[1:10:05] all going to be dead,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what eventually is going to
[1:10:10] happen anyway. But we're all going to be
[1:10:12] dead. We'll all be shot. We'll all be
[1:10:13] killed. We'll all somehow be murdered.
[1:10:16] Amen. Because that's the place. Vicious.
[1:10:19] See,
[1:10:21] savagery, brutal. That's where it's
[1:10:24] become. Perilous. Perilous times. Men
[1:10:28] shall be lovers. Humanity, shall I say,
[1:10:31] not just men, humanity shall be lovers
[1:10:33] of their own selves,
[1:10:36] covetous,
[1:10:37] boasters,
[1:10:39] proud,
[1:10:40] blasphemers,
[1:10:42] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[1:10:45] unholy.
[1:10:46] What a place we have.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Unholy. And we have such a holy God.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Without natural affection. That that one
[1:10:57] seems to be taking greater hold in this
[1:10:58] world than anything right now. Amen. Is
[1:11:01] unnatural affection.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Which is could be one of the bottom
[1:11:06] lines behind the shooting this week.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unnatural affection.
[1:11:12] I know. I know it had something to do
[1:11:14] with the those poor kids that got shot
[1:11:16] up to that Catholic church. That guy was
[1:11:18] such a coward. He didn't even go inside
[1:11:20] the church.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, talk about a horrible
[1:11:22] individual. He stays outside and blows
[1:11:25] out the windows just to try to shoot and
[1:11:27] kill people. I mean, that's just that's
[1:11:29] just about as cowardly as you can get.
[1:11:31] Then go squat down outside the parking
[1:11:32] lot and shoot yourself.
[1:11:35] That's just but it's it's savagery.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's a murderous intent, idea,
[1:11:41] thought,
[1:11:43] try to eradicate anything that's not
[1:11:46] like you, anything that disagrees with
[1:11:48] you.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But dar said, "Now I don't I don't
[1:11:52] I don't want to
[1:11:54] don't get me wrong, please. I'm not
[1:11:55] trying to say that Charlie is Jesus
[1:11:57] Christ." But the same thing happened to
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ. Amen. The devil want had
[1:12:02] him in his sights the whole time. Kill
[1:12:04] him, murder him,
[1:12:07] take his take his life. And he finally
[1:12:10] got him and he hung him on the cross. Of
[1:12:12] course, Jesus didn't hang him. Jesus
[1:12:13] laid down his life. No man could take
[1:12:16] it.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; But he laid down his life. But the
[1:12:18] celebration in hell began and Satan was
[1:12:21] happy. Little did he know what he had
[1:12:25] unleashed by killing Jesus Christ.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Little did he know what he had
[1:12:29] unleashed. Now he doesn't just have
[1:12:30] Jesus to deal with. He's got millions,
[1:12:33] millions of believers, millions of
[1:12:35] people that follow him. Amen. I told you
[1:12:37] about that spider in I tell you about
[1:12:40] that spider in Florida that time uh that
[1:12:42] I heard about these big tree spiders in
[1:12:45] Florida that come and they fall off the
[1:12:47] trees and get in your house. They're
[1:12:48] hard to exterminate them. But there was
[1:12:50] one lady had on her wall in her kitchen
[1:12:52] is big old the legs are just big.
[1:12:55] They're harmless. Uh but it's a spider.
[1:12:59] But they don't hurt you. But this woman
[1:13:01] saw one on the wall in her kitchen. She
[1:13:03] smacked it uh with a roll of paper or
[1:13:05] something and Did she know there was a
[1:13:07] sack of babies under that woman, under
[1:13:09] that mother? And when she smacked that
[1:13:11] spider, she killed the mama, but she
[1:13:13] spread hundreds of little babies all
[1:13:15] over the place. She had to fumigate the
[1:13:18] house because there spiders everywhere.
[1:13:20] Hundreds of them went all over the
[1:13:21] place. Amen. That's what Satan tries to
[1:13:23] do. He might smack one, but what he did
[1:13:26] is he just he just uh I don't say
[1:13:30] enraged, but encouraged and brought
[1:13:32] about the fervor of those thousands,
[1:13:35] hundreds of thousands or even millions
[1:13:37] of people. Amen. And now he's got them
[1:13:40] all stirred up.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now what happens there?
[1:13:45] He's in for it. Amen. He knows he's in
[1:13:49] for it now.
[1:13:51] my mind. Unholy, without natural
[1:13:54] affection. Said that. Amen.
[1:13:58] Truth breakers, false accusers,
[1:14:02] incontinent, which means unable, fierce,
[1:14:06] and despisers of those that are good.
[1:14:09] Despisers of those that are good. Amen.
[1:14:13] I don't know about the girl on the on
[1:14:15] the the rail train, but the the the one
[1:14:18] kid shot up all those people in that
[1:14:20] church. Amen. This guy shot and killed a
[1:14:24] person that expoused Christianity as
[1:14:27] much as anybody probably that I know
[1:14:29] anyway. Amen. espouse Christianity and
[1:14:32] Jesus Christ and being godly and being a
[1:14:34] Christian and the principles of a good
[1:14:36] family life and having a mother and a
[1:14:39] father and uh things that seem to be out
[1:14:42] of sorts today for people uh but they
[1:14:45] hate them for it. They they despisers of
[1:14:48] those that are good,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Confused people in this world who
[1:14:53] are getting confused. uh doctors telling
[1:14:56] them things, teachers telling them
[1:14:57] things, people telling them things that
[1:14:59] they shouldn't that that young minds
[1:15:01] shouldn't be exposed to, uh telling them
[1:15:05] raising and say, "Uh, well, well, my
[1:15:07] child's born, they can decide whether
[1:15:09] they're a boy or a girl." And who does?
[1:15:11] That's just evil.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; And look at them and tell them, you
[1:15:14] know, well, are you a boy or a girl? You
[1:15:16] say, "Well, I don't know. Maybe today
[1:15:17] I'll be a boy. I don't know. Tomorrow
[1:15:18] I'll be a girl." You know, and they get
[1:15:21] so they get so they're not equipped.
[1:15:24] Humans, first of all, much less little
[1:15:26] kids, their brains aren't equipped to
[1:15:28] try to accept and receive and process
[1:15:30] that kind of knowledge that that thought
[1:15:34] process and they get all confused and it
[1:15:37] I imagine it becomes very depressing.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And very hard to what what do I do from
[1:15:44] here? You know, am I a boy? Am I a girl?
[1:15:46] what what uh
[1:15:49] they become so confused and they they
[1:15:51] don't know what to do and their life
[1:15:53] gets becomes a pure mess and then they
[1:15:55] become despisers of those that are good.
[1:15:58] Amen. Because that whole thing is evil
[1:16:00] to begin with. Amen. Traitors, heady,
[1:16:04] high-minded, lovers of pleasure more
[1:16:06] than lovers of God, having a form of
[1:16:09] godliness, but denying the power thereof
[1:16:11] from such turn away. For of this s sort
[1:16:14] are they which crept into houses and led
[1:16:17] captive silly women laden with sin led
[1:16:19] away with divers lust ever learning
[1:16:21] never able to come to the knowledge of
[1:16:23] the truth. Now as Janice and Jammers
[1:16:25] withtood Moses so do these also resist
[1:16:28] the truth. Men of corrupt minds
[1:16:32] reprobate
[1:16:33] concerning the faith. Reprobate. Amen.
[1:16:37] That means they're
[1:16:39] uh vile,
[1:16:42] uh disgusting,
[1:16:45] a reprobate, someone who is who is uh
[1:16:48] gone off on to the the nastiness, the
[1:16:52] filthiness, the the ungodly.
[1:16:55] Amen. Not not to return even not not to
[1:16:59] return apostasy, if you will.
[1:17:04] But they shall proceed no further, for
[1:17:06] their folly shall be made manifest unto
[1:17:08] all men, as theirs was also. But thou
[1:17:11] hast fully known my doctrine, manner of
[1:17:13] life, purpose, faith, longsuffering,
[1:17:15] charity, patience, persecutions,
[1:17:17] afflictions, which came unto me at
[1:17:19] Antioch, at Iconium, at Lististra, uh
[1:17:22] what persecutions I endured. But out of
[1:17:25] them all, the Lord delivered me. Praise
[1:17:27] God. Yay. And all that will live godly
[1:17:30] in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:17:32] persecution. Right.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. All that live godly in Christ
[1:17:37] Jesus shall suffer persecution,
[1:17:40] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:17:42] worse and worse. Deceiving and being
[1:17:46] deceived. Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; A lot of times a person has to be
[1:17:50] deceived first before they can be
[1:17:52] deceiving.
[1:17:53] They have to first be deceived by
[1:17:55] someone before they are deceiving
[1:17:57] others.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have to first be deceived.
[1:18:01] But continue thou in the things which
[1:18:03] thou hast learned and hast been assured
[1:18:05] of knowing of whom thou hast uh learned
[1:18:08] them. And from a child thou hast known
[1:18:10] the holy scriptures which are able to
[1:18:13] make thee wise unto salvation through
[1:18:15] faith which is in Christ Jesus. All
[1:18:18] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[1:18:20] is profitable for doctrine, for reprove,
[1:18:22] for correction, for instruction in
[1:18:24] righteousness, that the man of God may
[1:18:26] be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto
[1:18:29] all good works. Thoroughly furnished
[1:18:32] against the word that comes forth.
[1:18:34] Remember, faith comes by hearing and
[1:18:36] hearing the word of God. Amen. Hearing
[1:18:39] the word of God. Today,
[1:18:42] in a great way, our values are under
[1:18:46] attack.
[1:18:47] Yes.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; The way that we believe and the things
[1:18:51] that we hold dear are under attack by a
[1:18:55] whole another sect of people, possessed
[1:18:59] people, I will say, that want to
[1:19:03] eradicate anything that is godly or like
[1:19:08] God,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Or espouses God or projects God or tries
[1:19:13] to help others find God. They want to
[1:19:16] eradicate, kill it, do away with it. And
[1:19:19] they celebrate that fact even if it
[1:19:21] comes at the expense of a human life.
[1:19:25] Matthew 25. I want to read this. I'll
[1:19:27] close here in just a minute.
[1:19:33] Where are we at when human life has
[1:19:35] devolved
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; to the place of a senseless murder like
[1:19:38] that like those?
[1:19:41] But where are we even worse when there's
[1:19:46] people that are happy about it
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; and celebrate it not just to themselves
[1:19:52] but to the world,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; They'll get on a platform,
[1:19:58] this social media,
[1:20:01] and share it with the entire world that
[1:20:04] they're happy that this person died.
[1:20:09] I saw an interview of someone that said,
[1:20:12] "I wished I had done it."
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, you you talk about a humanity
[1:20:18] that's devolved
[1:20:21] that is become so devalued where it
[1:20:25] doesn't it means nothing anymore.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. When a person gets to the point
[1:20:31] that they think that uh that your life
[1:20:35] means nothing, that's a sad that's a sad
[1:20:38] state that we're in. But look, in the
[1:20:41] evil, remember the two spirits, those
[1:20:44] things are still working. Brother
[1:20:45] Brandham talked about that. Go look the
[1:20:47] two spirits that come up all the way
[1:20:49] through the scripture. They're they
[1:20:50] started with Cain and Abel still going.
[1:20:53] Those same those two spirits. Amen. And
[1:20:56] I will just simply call them good and
[1:20:59] evil. I I mean that's a simplistic way
[1:21:02] of saying it. That's just the way it
[1:21:03] basically is. You got good and you got
[1:21:05] evil. And those two spirits are there.
[1:21:07] But I want to focus for this last little
[1:21:09] bit on the good.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Matthew 25 verse one. Then shall the
[1:21:15] kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10
[1:21:17] virgins which took their lamps and went
[1:21:20] forth to meet the bridegroom.
[1:21:23] Five of them were wise, five were
[1:21:24] foolish. They that were foolish took
[1:21:26] their lamps and took no oil with them.
[1:21:29] Remember that. But they're all but
[1:21:30] they're still virtuous. Remember,
[1:21:32] they're still virtuous. But the wise
[1:21:34] took oil in their vessels with their
[1:21:36] lamps while the bridegroom carried. So
[1:21:39] it wasn't just something that you felt.
[1:21:41] It wasn't just a tingling on your flesh.
[1:21:43] You actually had an indwelling presence
[1:21:46] of the spirit of Christ in you. Amen.
[1:21:49] Not just an anointing like the what?
[1:21:52] Like the foolish. The foolish have an
[1:21:53] anointing. Absolutely. They have that
[1:21:56] anointing. That anointing makes them
[1:21:58] shout and scream and dance and worship
[1:22:00] and cry and all the emotions that go
[1:22:02] along with a lot of worship that we know
[1:22:04] that true genuine worship is the same in
[1:22:07] there as they're anointed of that Holy
[1:22:09] Spirit. But that anointing only goes on
[1:22:12] the flesh. You read back in Acts two.
[1:22:16] Amen. When they got the Holy Spirit, it
[1:22:18] wasn't just on them, but it was in them.
[1:22:21] Amen. There's a difference. And the wise
[1:22:26] had oil in their lamps and in their
[1:22:29] vessels.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the foolish now,
[1:22:33] but the wise took fourth verse. Let me
[1:22:35] continue to read this. The wise took oil
[1:22:36] in their vessels with their lamps. While
[1:22:39] the bridegroom carried, they all
[1:22:41] slumbered and slept. All of them were
[1:22:42] asleep. That's why I said, "Bride, wake
[1:22:44] up."
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; And at midnight there was a cry made.
[1:22:47] Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out
[1:22:49] to meet him. All the virgins arose and
[1:22:53] trimmed their lamps. Amen.
[1:22:56] They all prepared themselves. But what
[1:22:59] was the defining factor? It wasn't what
[1:23:02] they could do with their with their
[1:23:04] bodies or with their flesh, but were
[1:23:07] they born again?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did they have Christ living in
[1:23:12] them? Had they gone to the new birth?
[1:23:15] And the foolish said unto the wise,
[1:23:17] "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are
[1:23:19] gone out." But the wise answered,
[1:23:21] saying, "Not so, lest there," now
[1:23:23] remember this is just a parable. The
[1:23:26] wise answered, saying, "Not so, lest
[1:23:28] there be not enough for us and you. But
[1:23:30] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[1:23:33] for yourselves." And while they went to
[1:23:36] buy, while the foolish virgin went to
[1:23:38] seek for that oil. Amen. When they went
[1:23:42] to buy, the bridegroom came. That's when
[1:23:45] the bridegroom came.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; now, we're looking for our loved ones to
[1:23:48] appear any times,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in prayer and after
[1:23:54] prayer and during prayer a lot of times
[1:23:56] is uh probably more than others when my
[1:24:01] spiritual eye becomes open to think
[1:24:04] could it be today?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Could it be right now? When I open my
[1:24:08] eyes, is my family going to be standing
[1:24:10] in front of me? Is my mom, my dad, my
[1:24:12] son, are they going to be there? Because
[1:24:15] we're that close.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. I I
[1:24:19] don't know how I express that any any
[1:24:22] better. I'm actually kind of surprised,
[1:24:24] although it may come in the near future.
[1:24:26] I'm actually kind of surprised at this
[1:24:28] point that the Pope hasn't had something
[1:24:30] to say about uh this murder. Uh I I'm
[1:24:34] I'm kind of surprised, not that he
[1:24:36] wouldn't in the near future, it would
[1:24:38] surprise it would not surprise me if
[1:24:41] something was said or brought as an
[1:24:43] official statement or from him
[1:24:44] personally uh about this situation. But
[1:24:48] notice when the bridegroom comes
[1:24:51] is when the foolish virgin is going
[1:24:54] after that oil,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And if this move, and I'll say if
[1:24:59] because I don't know for sure, but it
[1:25:00] sure looks that way. The the way people
[1:25:02] are fired up now and fired up about
[1:25:04] Christ and fired up about the word. uh
[1:25:07] if they are at that place that they're
[1:25:09] that they're gathering together and
[1:25:11] having uh these as they call them
[1:25:15] revival or whatever going after that
[1:25:17] oil. Uh then we're living in scriptural
[1:25:20] time. We already know the last days. We
[1:25:23] already know that we're in the last
[1:25:25] days,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; But when they went to go by, the
[1:25:28] bridegroom came, right?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom came for the five wise
[1:25:33] virgins.
[1:25:35] the bride. He came to take her home
[1:25:38] while they were out looking for that
[1:25:39] oil.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; What time are we living now?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; What time are we in? Cuz I'll be honest
[1:25:48] that this is the first thought that came
[1:25:50] to my mind when I saw a lot of this
[1:25:52] stuff unfolding and developing. This is
[1:25:55] the first thing that came to my mind.
[1:25:58] They might that God might have silenced
[1:26:01] one voice, but I think all he did was
[1:26:05] unleash millions of other voices that
[1:26:07] are going to start crying out now and
[1:26:10] louder and more bolder and uh greater
[1:26:14] than than it's probably been maybe in my
[1:26:17] lifetime even I'll say. Now, what has
[1:26:22] that done? Well, you look in the nominal
[1:26:24] world. You look you look in the nominal
[1:26:26] world and you see the thing that they're
[1:26:29] the stirring that's going on.
[1:26:32] What is that thing that they're that
[1:26:34] they're looking for that they're going
[1:26:35] after?
[1:26:37] Well, brother Brandham, Brother Brandham
[1:26:39] in a couple of places talked to us about
[1:26:42] how when that nominal church goes after
[1:26:45] that oil, when that nominal church goes
[1:26:48] after that oil,
[1:26:50] the bridegroom comes, the bride's going
[1:26:53] home.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:54] So if all these all these things are
[1:26:58] evolving in front of us, uh the pope
[1:27:01] from America, I mean I we could go on
[1:27:04] for the next 30 minutes, but the point
[1:27:06] is we know all these things that have
[1:27:08] been happening and prophecy being
[1:27:11] fulfilled and scripture being fulfilled
[1:27:13] and things that's unfolding in front of
[1:27:15] us is bringing us to this point now.
[1:27:17] What what sort of people ought we to be
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; in all holiness? Amen. And
[1:27:23] righteousness. What kind of people ought
[1:27:24] we to be now more than ever?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; It's like Madison said, if you want I if
[1:27:31] you want to try to talk to somebody
[1:27:33] about Jesus Christ and get them in,
[1:27:35] now's the time to do it.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Now's the time to try to spread that and
[1:27:40] let the people know that that
[1:27:44] Jesus Christ is Lord.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; He's your savior and receive him. This
[1:27:50] now's the time to do it.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this
[1:27:55] I I all this happening is just is not
[1:27:58] coincidental.
[1:28:00] Uh prophecy again being fulfilled.
[1:28:03] Scripture being fulfilled.
[1:28:07] Is this that? I don't know. But it sure
[1:28:10] looks like this is going to create
[1:28:12] something that's going to bubble over
[1:28:15] now. Amen. And bring us to this this
[1:28:18] point in the scripture.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. I' look if you have any loved ones
[1:28:23] in past in Christ that have gone on
[1:28:25] before, look for them, saints.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; they'll be per you before you at any
[1:28:30] time. Any time.
[1:28:36] While they went to buy, the bridegroom
[1:28:38] came, and they that were ready went in
[1:28:42] with him to the marriage, and the door
[1:28:44] was shut
[1:28:46] just like it was on Noah's ark.
[1:28:49] Afterward came also the other virgins
[1:28:51] saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But it
[1:28:54] now look, it doesn't say they actually
[1:28:56] got the oil.
[1:28:58] Amen. There nowhere in the scripture
[1:29:00] says they went to go get it, but nowhere
[1:29:02] in the scripture does it say they
[1:29:03] actually got it. Amen. They still were
[1:29:06] depending on that anointing. But look,
[1:29:08] when this bride leaves, that anointing
[1:29:10] leaves, there's nothing of God left.
[1:29:13] He'll be dealing with the Jews,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; There's nothing left. them. What do they
[1:29:18] have? Their testimony. That's all
[1:29:21] they'll have left, their testimony.
[1:29:22] Brother Bam said they'll have to seal
[1:29:24] their testimony with their blood.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin does.
[1:29:30] While they went to buy, the bridegroom
[1:29:32] came, and they were they that were ready
[1:29:34] with went in with him to the marriage,
[1:29:36] and the door was shut. Afterward, came
[1:29:38] also the other virgin, saying, Lord,
[1:29:40] Lord, open to us. And he answered and
[1:29:42] said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
[1:29:45] not. Now, this is not the same where he
[1:29:48] told them, "I never knew you." Amen. As
[1:29:51] in, "I never had relation or never had
[1:29:54] fellowship with you." This is I'm
[1:29:56] ignoring you. Amen. I've turned uh this
[1:30:00] probably sounds crude, but I've turned
[1:30:02] my back to you. I'm not listening to
[1:30:04] you.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? They had their chance,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; They had their chance to get what the
[1:30:10] wise virgin had, and they didn't get it.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Now, what have we got? The bride has
[1:30:15] gone home, and the world falls into
[1:30:17] apostasy.
[1:30:20] I know you not. Watch therefore, for you
[1:30:23] know neither the day nor the hour
[1:30:25] wherein the Son of Man cometh, what day
[1:30:27] or hour that we're in. Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Watch therefore and pray.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:35] You don't know the day or the hour, but
[1:30:37] friend, I believe the bride knows the
[1:30:40] season.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we're in that season
[1:30:43] right now.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; We know that season is the last days,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; And we're in the end of the last days.
[1:30:52] How much longer can this go?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; How much longer can it survive? How much
[1:30:57] how much longer can it exist in this
[1:30:59] state?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; It's hard to know. Get into Christ.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Get into Christ.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Spirit. Be born again.
[1:31:09] Anything you've ever done, be born again
[1:31:12] with his spirit.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Peter gave us that uh he just gave us
[1:31:16] Peter gave us that uh recipe on the day
[1:31:19] of Pentecost. Repent, be baptized in the
[1:31:21] name of Jesus Christ, and you shall
[1:31:24] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; that's our promise. That's our promised
[1:31:29] land. We know that the Lord has promised
[1:31:32] that to us living in this evil world,
[1:31:36] living in this evil land.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh
[1:31:42] I'm not here to try to paint especially
[1:31:44] for our precious Madison who's so young
[1:31:47] uh paint a horrible picture, but friend
[1:31:49] to the bride that's a beautiful picture.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, it is.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; I mean the bride,
[1:31:55] the worse the world gets, the closer we
[1:31:57] are to going home.
[1:31:59] That's just scripture.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's it's not a matter of
[1:32:04] saying that um this world is a horrible
[1:32:08] place. I think we've kind of all got to
[1:32:10] the understanding to know that
[1:32:14] with everything that's going on and and
[1:32:16] all just as we know and how much of it
[1:32:20] we don't know,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; God have mercy.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; you see in the coming days when all this
[1:32:29] starts stirring, it's already stirring.
[1:32:32] Amen. You see it continue to stir and
[1:32:35] gain a greater fervor.
[1:32:38] We're at that time.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; My opinion, we're at that time, s
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:32:45] going home to be with her, Lord.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so looking forward to
[1:32:49] that. Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we
[1:32:52] could.
[1:32:58] I wanted to bring that.
[1:33:03] I wanted to bring that
[1:33:06] realization
[1:33:09] and what I felt in my heart that the
[1:33:12] Lord I felt the Lord showed me
[1:33:16] of what's about to take place, what's
[1:33:19] beginning to unfold.
[1:33:22] Can we uh this evening time?
[1:33:27] I want to sing this course and then
[1:33:30] recognize we are in the evening time.
[1:33:36] Darkness grows darkness to people. But
[1:33:39] at the evening time there shall be
[1:33:41] light. And we are in that light. We are
[1:33:44] that light because Christ is that light.
[1:33:47] And Christ is in us shining forth that
[1:33:50] light.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:55] Let's sing this.
[1:33:57] It is the evening time, saints. We're
[1:33:59] about ready to go home. Amen.
[1:34:04] This is the evening time.
[1:34:08] It's later than you think.
[1:34:13] The bride is preparing now for her Lord
[1:34:20] to me.
[1:34:24] All things are ready now.
[1:34:28] The bridegroom I hear.
[1:34:34] He that has an ear to hear the evening
[1:34:39] time is here.
[1:34:43] The God of this evil age
[1:34:48] has blinded the eyes today
[1:34:53] of people who walk their own way not
[1:34:57] according to God's word
[1:35:03] denying the things he's done
[1:35:08] of sending his only son,
[1:35:13] accepting the creeds of men, rejecting
[1:35:18] the word of God.
[1:35:23] Yes, this is the evening time.
[1:35:28] It's later than you think.
[1:35:32] The bride is preparing now for her Lord
[1:35:39] to me.
[1:35:43] All things are ready now.
[1:35:47] The bridegroom I hear.
[1:35:52] He that has an ear to hear. The evening
[1:35:57] time is here.
[1:36:02] There's darkness throughout this land.
[1:36:07] This world just can't understand.
[1:36:12] A prophet has walked this land
[1:36:15] proclaiming the way to God.
[1:36:21] If you would be saved today,
[1:36:26] then follow the words he gave.
[1:36:31] Believing the word of God. This is the
[1:36:36] evening time.
[1:36:40] Yes, this is the evening time.
[1:36:45] It's later than you think.
[1:36:50] The bride is preparing now for her Lord
[1:36:56] to meet.
[1:37:00] All things are ready now.
[1:37:05] The bridegroom I hear.
[1:37:10] He that has an ear to hear. The evening
[1:37:14] time is here.
[1:37:18] Yes. He that has an ear to hear that
[1:37:23] evening time is here.
[1:37:29] Oh, it's here, saints.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; God have mercy.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; There's anything we can do to help the
[1:37:37] kingdom of God, we should do it now.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Is there anything we can do for God and
[1:37:42] for his kingdom? Let's do it now.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know there's
[1:37:48] maybe a handful of people, I don't know,
[1:37:51] God knows
[1:37:54] that's still out there. It's hard.
[1:37:56] People don't want to listen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; They've turned their back on God.
[1:38:00] They've turned into scoffers turning
[1:38:02] their back on God.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:05] Jesus laid down his life
[1:38:08] knowing that all of humanity would need
[1:38:11] it,
[1:38:12] but realizing that very few would ever
[1:38:15] accept it.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; But he did it anyway.
[1:38:19] I want to be I am one of those few.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And if there's any others that we can
[1:38:25] help to bring in.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And make ourselves make sure
[1:38:30] ourselves we are ready.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now is the time.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; it is the evening time, saints. Amen. It
[1:38:38] is later than all of us could imagine.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you today. I
[1:38:44] pray something was said to bless and
[1:38:46] strengthen you, Lord. Just keep us, help
[1:38:49] us. We have time. If the Lord carries
[1:38:51] through the week and give us grace
[1:38:53] through the week and bless each one of
[1:38:55] you and jobs and whatever the Lord has
[1:38:57] for you and just bless you richly.
[1:39:00] Remember, Lord willing, next week, next
[1:39:02] Sunday, uh plan on having the Lord's
[1:39:05] supper and footwashing. So, please keep
[1:39:07] that in your heart and mind. Next
[1:39:09] Sunday, we'll have the Lord's supper and
[1:39:12] foot washing here at the church. Amen.
[1:39:17] So, God bless you. I think that was the
[1:39:19] only announcement I had.
[1:39:22] Anybody else have anything before
[1:39:24] anything?
[1:39:27] Amen. Again, please remember these
[1:39:30] requests. Amen. Those that we mentioned
[1:39:33] and brought before you our church and
[1:39:35] not in our church, but a part uh that we
[1:39:38] just have compassion, empathy, and love
[1:39:40] for humanity.
[1:39:42] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:39:47] Also had a birthday this week. My sister
[1:39:49] Nor.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord. Happy birthday to
[1:39:56] sister.
[1:39:58] We're so blessed and to have her with
[1:40:00] us. So, pray she had a wonderful blessed
[1:40:02] birthday. So, God richly bless you
[1:40:05] today.
[1:40:08] Amen. Lord be with you.

[1:41:02] minds, Lord Jesus.
