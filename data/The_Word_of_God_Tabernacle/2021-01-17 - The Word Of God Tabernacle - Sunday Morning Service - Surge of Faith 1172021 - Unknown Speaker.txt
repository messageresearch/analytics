TRANSCRIPT
========================================
morning everyone god bless you again today uh welcome to our living room once again fortunately uh circumstances are the way they are we're live streaming again from our living room today uh but i welcome you appreciate you being here appreciate you being part of the streaming service i pray if you watch it live or if you watch it archive that god richly bless you uh through what he would speak to us today and we thank the lord for his word we thank him for his goodness thank him for this day that he's given us this day is unlike any other day friend that we're going through and we've seen many days and i know there's been days in the past but this day is the day and this is the time in the season of a rapture that a bride's about to be caught away to go home to be with him and so shall we ever be with the lord it's a quite a time that we live but i'm very thankful that the lord has made a way in the ability to be able to still communicate and get together and spend time together just i would encourage you to please don't get comfortable being at home my home is a place of comfort i know that but there's nothing like gathering together with those of like precious faith and i believe that's scriptural and uh you come and you're there regularly you understand uh the spirit that's there and the lord's blessed our services so much and so just don't get comfortable sitting there i'm not going to get comfortable being here i never did and i'm still not but lord willing next week we'll be in service next week uh back the way things were i will have service next week there at our regular um building so i'll just remember that in prayer all of us are still perfectly healthy and fine me and sonia's perfectly healthy and fine joel and emma and zach and tabitha are perfectly fine uh that a false positive test hasn't affected us any so we're just very thankful that god's blessed us i work most of the week all week and um guys just take god takes care of his own so i appreciate that uh he never leaves us or forsakes us friend you know sometimes it seems like and maybe i preach a message on this sometimes but i was thinking about this the other day and that's praying and talking to the lord and i said you know it seems like humans get so conditioned in our minds and our spirits to accept failure and accept disappointment and believe that even those that are the closest and dearest to us in our lives are going to disappoint us and they're going to let us down and um and and even gonna hurt us uh and then sometimes it seems like we transition that over into the spirit realm and to god and it's almost like we think it's on some level that god's going to disappoint us eventually that god's going to eventually let us down that god's going to eventually leave us or leave us alone whatever you know bring disappointment as far as him but friend that'll never happen god can never leave god can never forsake god never let down god can never disappoint uh so we gotta morph ourselves out of that time thought of you know in this life in this world of how those things go along and just forget about that and know that god is always going to be there he's never going to do what we have and received from other humans so and based on that we're very thankful again today to have you here and to have this ability to stream today and pray that the lord bless you richly before we go to the lord in prayer now i have a couple prayer requests a few prayer requests actually uh didn't realize how many there were but i wrote a few of them down i usually can remember them but i didn't want to make sure and leave anybody out so i'll have a prayer request brother danny had sent me a request as we were talking uh yesterday he had told me that his upper dental plate had broken so it's kind of expensive to get a new one he was hoping that they could fix the one he has so please remember him in prayer remember that situation they could fix that plate so that he doesn't have to spend over a thousand dollars for a new one so remember him in prayer also remember sister lydia and their family uh fortunately and thankfully brother john and brother ralph tested negative for covid uh but she told me that jennifer's still not feeling well and lydia herself is having some symptoms yet so please remember them in prayer if you would god would keep his hand upon them and continue to heal and touch them also sister sheila had mentioned that harlan her brother is supposed to hopefully finally maybe have his court date this wednesday the 20th inauguration day uh no less uh she wants us to remember harlan in prayer the lord would just find favor with harlan and and with the relationship with his wife you know my prayers that they could reconcile and that they would serve the lord together and that god would bless their marriage and that they could be together but of course with this court date just trust in the lord would help harlan and help men that situation with his wife and of course find favor with the court system so please remember that in prayer and also i got a call kind of late last night wasn't too late but um that brother pat had called me in and told me that his first wife sonya had passed away um gonna be grieving of course with pat jr which was that was his mother brother pat's first son first child pat jr live in memphis and tennessee area there and so he was quite grieved and certainly want to remember brother pat and sister pat and of course the family pat junior and all those affected sonya was mars hundreds daughter of course so the ungram family and all those that are intertwined and connected there uh be grieving today so please remember them in prayer the lord would just touch them and help them now you know seems like a lot of light is leaving the world today a lot of people passing away a lot of believers um brother roger had showed me i'd known a couple of them but brother rodriguez showed me something somebody had said to him five message ministers went on to be with the lord in one week i believe it was last week not this past week but the week before five in one week had gone to be with the lord and you won ropi turner that didn't include brother jim diffendorfer we know here in tucson who did minister a little bit so a lot of light i spoke to a couple weeks ago at the church about that little sliver of light that god put in there for this last age that light is getting darker that darkness is encroaching in as that light goes from the earth and eventually the the culmination of the last of that light is going to leave this earth and it'll be nothing but total darkness uh but but but we're here so praise the lord and thankful for that but remember these prayer requests if you would and we'll pray together now and just trust the lord as he is mindful of those needs to hold them before the lord so let's pray if we put it together now precious lord we're so thankful jesus for all the greatness love and mercy that you give lord you're so good to us and we thank you for this word we thank you for the time to meet together lord even if it is just living room to living room or on their phones tablets computers wherever they are lord i just pray that your hand would be upon everyone bless those who may watch this in the archive and wherever this message may go god may you strengthen us by it and show us what you'd have us to see and know we believe lord that your hand is upon every request and every need that was mentioned today we believe that you god are the the way maker father you're the miracle worker you are the one that answers all these requests and needs and we lift and bind our faith together before you now in the name of jesus christ do you help brother danny lord his sister lydia and her family and brother pat and uh and harlan lord sister sheila's brother and any other request that we have god lord move upon your people even now father we just believe in god that your hand is upon each one to grant grace and mercy and lord that your light would shine upon their pathway again even if it's just a step at a time we're trusting and believing is as david said a lamp unto our feet and a light into our path lord may that word illuminate to us today god and shine forth to us through revelation to help us grow closer to you more like you lord may you make it more real to us than it ever has been father for we believe that word and we hold true to it we know that you never fail us lord men fell us people fail us even the closest and dearest ones to us sometimes will disappoint and fail us but god we're so thankful that you never fail us leave us or forsake us god we can have confidence to believe that your word is true it'll always always stand as we stand and you stand for us we stand for you god we just pray that you would speak through these lips now the word she'd have us to hear may your holy spirit move upon it lord may it sweep through every house every building every place where anybody may be watching or listening right now moving here god i pray to this home to this place and have your way once again father as we committed to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you now i've uh got a thought that uh kind of came to me yesterday is i had something i wanted to speak to this i still do have something that i want to speak to you about but i want to do it live in person and actually it seems to have grown into maybe two or three different services uh so i want to speak to you about that i mentioned to you in a text yesterday that something very serious i want to talk to you very important i want to talk to you about too that is off camera that'll be a that won't be stream that'll be something totally different but uh but the messages that i had on my heart so when it came to looking that uh we were gonna do the streaming again today the lord just almost as quick as i felt decided to do this instead of meeting in person uh put something on my heart as a i was texting back and forth with sister sheila and uh she was talking about the great surge of uh covet going on today and if you watch the news or listen to things that go on in the country in the world uh and this surge that's happening they always talk about the surge either either we're either surging or there's about to be a surge if you watch the news or listen to people this is the darkest hour this is the darkest time there's going to be a great surge there's a surge of this and the hospitals are surged with people and the covet is surging because of positive tests and now we don't even know how many of those positive tests are actually positive but anyway uh it just gave me a thought we don't need to worry about it be concerned with the surge of covet we need to be concerned with and look for a surge of faith a surge of faith today that's what we need more than anything because faith is what's going to take this bride out of this world faith is what helps mold and shape our lives every day faith is what gets us from moment to moment and day to day and week to week faith is how we live we don't step without faith we don't breathe without faith we don't live without faith and we need a surge of faith brother braden says it many many times if you're going to go look and just type in if you can in the search quote now a search of faith and see how many times he talks about it that surge of faith that we need and i just want to talk about that for a little bit today uh maybe a simplistic message or something just to be an encouragement to you but i want to start oddly enough we're not starting in hebrews 11 but i want to start in second kings second kings the sixth chapter and i want to read a few verses but then i want to revert back to the beginning of the chapter so uh but i wouldn't just read this to lay this foundation on this surge of faith that i want to talk about this morning so let's look at this second kings chapter six uh verse 13 is where i want to begin so let's look at that real quick second kings 6 13 and he said go and spy where he is now you'll get these he's when i read the rest of it in a minute uh it's actually the king of syria that's talking that that is the he that's the first he go and spy where he elisha is that i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan therefore sent heath through their horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city and when the servant of the man of god gaza elijah's servant the man of god was risen early and gone forth beholden hosts come past the city both with horses and chariots looked like a dire situation if you looked out your window today your house your apartment your uh your domicile wherever you are if you looked out today and you saw that there was horses and chariots around surrounding you let's just say the army of uh an invading country or even your own country army around you swords drawn guns drawn ready and you knew that they were there for you you knew that they were there to come and take you that would be a scary situation so this man of god this the servant of the man of god rose and went forth behold a host compassed the city with the horses and chariots and his servants said unto him now gaheza now said unto elisha alas my master what shall we do i see that's what the natural light thinks that's what the natural light and a lack of faith will do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen now what are you talking about a surge of faith see that man was looking through the eyes of faith he wasn't looking through the eyes of circumstance he wasn't looking through the eyes of what's going on and and the doubt and unbelief and everything that one that the world wants to feed you today he was looking through the eyes of faith which is the eyes that god wants us to have and put on and he says by faith there are more with us than there are with them so if you look out and you saw your domicile today and it was surrounded you knew that they were there to pick you up you could have the exact same faith to know and believe well there's more with us than there are with them there's more of us than than there are them amen there's because it's the same thing today god has no respect for person he doesn't look at elijah any better more than he does with us that same thing is for the bride of jesus christ today as it was then and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see now that's the eyes of faith that elijah's praying to god give to gehaza and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw wonderful and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about who elijah around about elisha amen that's where they were those chariots of fire the horses and chariots of fire had surrounded elisha now they didn't just surround elisha because of that circumstance i don't believe so because the scripture declares they didn't and we'll read that in a few minutes and they didn't just come past that at that time just because of elisha it wasn't just that specific moment because of those chariots that uh the king of syria had sent down oh no no these these horses and chariots of fire was with elijah elisha 24 7. they were there all the time because he was a believer he was a what we would call today a christian he wasn't a christian christ hadn't come yet but he was a believer he was a godly man he was a prophet of god now the prophet just puts him in a different office doesn't put him in a different sonship of christ or any closer to god than you are today doesn't make him any more important it's just the same faith that we have to have it's the same faith that surge of faith to believe now that surge of faith is something that that that we talk about the word surge as in something that is a that presses in hard but really the faith is there all the time it's just something for us that we believe it that we know when we say something or we believe upon that it's going to happen it's not a matter of doubt or unbelief or whether yes or no we know that god's going to do it it's there's not a question to it there's there's not a question to say well you know jesus even asked do you believe well that's a question well the question is yes i do believe or the answer is yes i do believe that's not a question that's a fact of statement yes i do believe will you either believe or you don't believe was i believe gaza believed but he wasn't looking to the right lens he wasn't looking to the right eyes that's why elijah prayed god open his eyes let him see through the same eyes that i'm looking through let him see what i'm seeing right now and recognize that there's horses and chariots of fire surrounding elisha are with him all the time they never left him they didn't come just because the horses of syria were there they were always there they never left him and if you believe that for him in the scripture and understand what the bible says and the promises for us today you can know the same thing as for you those same ones are there for us right now today they never leave you they don't come just when you're in distress they don't show up just when you're hurting or in pain they don't come just because you have some calamity going on in life they're always there they never leave you so no matter what compass you no matter what the devil tries to come and do to you no matter what he sends through you into your life to try to upset you it doesn't matter because the there always is more with us than there are with them always amen greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world why because we are all he is always there he never leaves us or forsakes us amen my wife's telling me nobody can see it i don't know why it looks like it's fine um to me can everybody hear it okay i only show one connected viewer here is everybody seeing this okay um i don't know it's showing up fine it's showing up fine here i don't know why nobody can see it um well i'm not i'm not sure how to change that or what to do about it it looks fine on my computer it's showing up fine on the stream on the studio it's showing up fine i'm not sure why it's not showing up anyway anybody see it let sonja know uh texture because i'm just gonna keep preaching so at least if you can't see it you can hear it because that's the main thing anyway so sorry this technology i'd rather be in person i always always always i'd rather be in person i don't i don't understand what the problem is here but uh it's working fine in front of me so we're just gonna keep preaching so let's go back to the first of that chapter and you can see me i don't know um but you can hear me hopefully you can hear me if you can hear me that's that's good but um let's go back to the beginning of the sixth chapter amen and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell with thee is too straight for us and a lot of times the way is too straight for a lot of people today they say they believe but they can't live it the way's too straight let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man of being and let us make a place there for we may dwell and he answered go ye and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered i will go so he went with them elisha did and when they came to jordan they cut down wood but as one was failing a beam the axe head fell into the water and he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed and and the man of god said where fell it and he showed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did swim now swim is i don't think the axe head grew arms and literally swam i believe this just came to the surface and floated there in the water but since when is iron float since when does an axe head or a piece an iron like that come from the bottom of the river to the top of the water and float if jesus can walk on water if if we with enough faith and the purpose to can walk on water then surely a night piece of iron can swim i mean the body of jesus weighed more than an axe head the body of peter who walked on water weighed more than an axe head what did it take what did it take to bring the buoyancy of that iron from the bottom of that river to the top of the water it took faith it took a surge of faith to believe now this wasn't something that uh that elijah had to go work up or make up he just said well where did he go in and he got a stick me put it in the cast in the water and then the iron came to the surface now why did it take that i don't know why did it have to take a a a stick or a piece of wood or something to throw in the water i don't know i don't know why it would look to be that way all i know is the iron swam because that's what the bible said the iron came to the surface now that helps you understand it wasn't just one circumstance in elijah's life this happened all the time this was something that was a part of elijah's life so those chariots around him those horses and chariots of fire that was around him wasn't just there because of the kings of syria that faith was always there so much so that the iron swamp now you think that's quite an and that's quite an outstanding testimony he said therefore take he uh said he take it up to thee and put it put out the hand and he took it he took the piece of iron out of the water and put it back in it wasn't this is not an allegory friend this is not something that um that's a story this this actually happened this is a piece of iron that floated to the top of the water not like a ship or a boat but just an axe head that had no reason to or buoyancy at all to float came back to the top of the water so he could get it now if it takes what kind of faith does it take to believe let's say for elisha to believe that that iron was going to come back to the top he did this knowing this was going to happen this wasn't a how was your faith day this was a it's going to happen day because it was it was always there he believed it he believed god and god honored his faith and it brought the iron to the surface now what kind of faith it takes for that to happen now if it takes that kind of faith what kind of faith is it going to take for us for for a rapture for a group of international people of all kindreds tongues nations people to to to have a body change to go on a rapture it it just because that defies as much as iron floating defies every law of physics science uh knowledge everything it defies this bride to to go in a rapture alive in her name dead in christ she rises alive and remains to go on a rapture is going to take a a faith greater than believing that a piece of iron can float like that because all of us around the world are gonna take a heavenly fight one day they're gonna go on a rapture well what kind of faith does that got to take it's got to be a rapturing faith a faith that's that that is enough to believe that it's not a how is your faith it is uh my faith is there i believe period i mean you know we stay home for two services because of a false positive and and and that's okay well what happens is if the real crisis hits uh is something even staunch or harder comes and friend harder times are coming uh i'm not painting a bleak picture i'm just talking about the world i'm not talking about the bride i'm saying the world in the world the darkness is just starting to come in in a in a way like it hasn't since the dark ages and it will surpass the dark ages because this is the time for us to move on uh to move upward uh to get out of this world uh it's a whole other time but i don't want to enter into that so maybe lord willing part of the next message next week but anyway let's just stay on understanding this surge of faith so when elijah was there with those men and they all saw that iron float uh what do you think how it was when his uh domicile was covered around surrounded around with the syrian army and knew he knew that they were there for him he knew that it wasn't like they were a mistaken identity it wasn't like they were there for dehaze or anyone else he knew they were there for him but he didn't panic he didn't fret gaza did he was worried to death he said oh master what are we going to do what are we going to do what are we going to do god said god open his eyes let him see there's more with us than there are with them and they opened and he saw those chariots of fires around about elisha amen those chariots of fire that always there and you may not see them friend but they're always there you may not recognize them or know them but they're always there they you may not see them with your natural eye but they are always there many times hopefully you probably feel the presence of those angels you feel the presence of those spirits that are there to keep you and to protect and to watch over that's that's god there watching over his own children now look what happened after god opens gahey's eyes and they see this this great uh uh a surge of faith i guess you could say that that guy that gaheza uh got when god opened his eyes you imagine can you imagine waking up and seeing the syrian army surround you and then can you imagine when god opens your eyes and you can see the chariots and the horses of fire all around you realizing that the mountains were full of them more with us than there are with them that didn't give you a surge of faith i'm sure it gave gays that a surge of faith but look what happens now these uh horses full of horses chariots of fire around about elijah 18 first now and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha miracle now not only are these people all around there and they're there for him knowing that the angels of god are all around him more than they are of the syrian army elisha just simply says lord just blind them blind and said they don't know who i am so when they come down here and they get in and they get i'll come to them i'll talk to them but just they won't know who i am blind and the lord smote them with blindness according to whose word elisha's amen faith according to whose word you got to believe this is a this is a this is a a message of faith this is a life of faith this is a speaking of faith believing amen and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek but he led them to samaria right in the hands of their enemy right in the hands of israel see it came to pass that when they were in coming to samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of syria can you imagine their surprise the king of israel said unto elijah when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them and elisha answered thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom the thou has taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master and he prepared great provisions for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their masters so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel amen that took care of it once and for all because why there was more with them more with him than there was with them there was more with elisha there was more on the believer's side it was more with us than there are with them i know the bible says that in this last day brother barum tells us this 200 million demons 200 000 000 demons 200 million demons loosed upon the bride for this last day friend but that hails in comparison to the angelic host that god has in camping us every day every moment you know if there's ever a time that something were to happen and and i've said this to you many times but god watches over his own and if something does happen if something does come up like this we know that it happened for a reason we know that god had to have allowed it and it had to have happened for a reason because nothing would happen to his children that he doesn't orchestrate or allow nothing there's not one thing that can happen look i i've read this scripture to you many times let's go to the book of job let's read here again refresh our memories about job and how job himself was hedged about amen you know that i pray that for you all the time friend i pray that for us for our church for our families for the bride internationally and then you know this cobit thing is an if there's a reason this covet thing is international it's an international thing that's hitting stuff like sarge and some of those things that happened in obama's administration things like that they were they were what they were they were kind of low-level things but this is something that has killed i believe over a million people internationally worldwide this is gripped and uh with fear pretty much every nation on the planet actually but i pray that god keep those angels and chariots of fire around you every day every moment every night and day your entire life protected keeping us i i know because i've heard testimony from you that and and us that's that's actually been around people that have gotten positive tests or showed symptoms and god protected you and god kept you and god blessed you god has watched over us and he still does i'm not saying that you couldn't get it uh sister lydia said she was still showing some symptoms and she didn't want to come to church with everybody until those symptoms were gone and i appreciate that i don't want a cold or flu any more than i won't covet and nobody wants to be sick so i say yeah if you have any symptoms by all means stay at home don't come with a group of people but i believe that god is continuing to bless and to keep his children and to watch over them i'm not saying that you might not get it i'm i'm believing that you won't because i'm believing my prayer my prayer is to keep us protected and and hedged uh so when that germ tries to cross that that break that that line of those angels those angels cut it off and don't allow it to come to you that's what i'm believing in faith so we're standing on that faith but we know that the scripture tells us that god has his people hedged not only was elisha there with those chariots of mountains full of the chariots and angels of fire around about them but look at what god was doing for joe of course job first chapter we won't be too long today so i'm just going to read these few verses here beginning with the sixth verse now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord satan came also among them the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job satan didn't bring up job why did satan not bring up job because he knew it was a futile attempt he doesn't quit he doesn't stop he still does it but he didn't bring up joke god brought up job god said hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and is she with evil or turns aside turns away from evil when evil presented itself job turned aside from it would not engage in it then satan answered the lord and said does job fear god for naught does job fear god for nothing there's a reason what god what satan is saying is god there's a reason why job serves you there's a reason why god why job trusts you and believes you there's a reason why job does that but see what satan doesn't understand because his whole world is based on that this whole world is based on filio at best love where one hand watches the other can't comprehend the fact that the children of god love god simply because he exists period not because he's done something for them or to them or because he's always there or the miracles and all the things we love god we serve god simply for the fact that he exists period we don't need a reason job didn't need a reason to serve god but that's satan's whole mindset if you will uh speaking in the natural vernacular that's his whole mindset oh he serves you because of something no we don't serve god because of something joke didn't serve god because of something job served god because he loved him because he was god and that's it amen that's that's why we serve him we serve him today not because of the things he does but because of who he is he simply exists and our love for him exists because he exists and he exists in us if he exists in us and that love he give us who he is is extended to him simply because he is but now satan is saying job sucks there's a reason why job serves you oh no there's not the devil has that has not thou made a hedge about him that's a surrounding that's a protective bubble if you will people talk about wanting to live in bubbles today i've seen people walk around town and they might as well have a bubble and discover the head to toe anyway and that's okay that's that's all right people you know they need they need to people need to live uh their life uh according to their beliefs and their faith and if that's as far as their faith takes them then okay that that's okay they they live that way but see what satan is recognizing is that those angels of god are around job satan is acknowledging the gods of the hedge a protective surrounding well what was the protective surrounding around elisha it was those angels and those mountains full the bible says surrounding elisha what's the same thing it was around job and satan acknowledges that and satan says you have a hedge about him and his house praise the lord all that he loved his family was hedged as well now were they under the same roof they may have been but our family may not all be under the same roof but they're protected by the same protection because you don't have to be under the same roof this is not a low cow faith this is not a locality a protection those angels are always with him always with us always with you always with our families you believe that faith amen believe that in faith it's that hedge surrounding him and his house and about all that he had on every side in other words i can't get to him i've tried i've sent my minions i've sent my devils i've sent my little demons out there to try to do everything they can and now they've buffeted the sister on the side and a brother on this side they've done this and they've done that but i just can't get to him praise the lord he just can't get to you what is that to get you to doubt to get you to unbelief to get you to go away from what god's promises are to you to take that surge of faith and get you worried about a surgical i'm not worried about a surge of cover friend i'm worried about my life having a surge of faith because i'm ready i'm getting ready i'm trusting god the bible says the bride has made herself ready to get out of here not to get used to it to become common i'm ready to get out of here amen praise the lord my family and all that i have every side that thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in his hand in in the land but put forth our hand now touch all that he had that he will curse thee did i face again there's a reason job servants should god as satan's reasoning there's a reason why i search it you take all that away from him and he'll curse you he won't serve you anymore see and then there's there there are people like that there's people that come to god and they say they've accepted him as their savior and they say they believe him they live for them and they go to church and they act and they do all the pomp and circumstance of a religious act and they become and join a denomination message or otherwise denominations of spirit friend a spirit uh it might have a title over it but it's just a spirit that spirit is in the message as much as it is anywhere no the message will not denominate the man said it wouldn't but the spirit of denominations around that around this message and that spirit comes so it doesn't matter whether that's got a name on it or whatever that spirit comes around and says and there's a lot of people that do that and as soon as the trouble hits and as soon as the trials hit as soon as the hard times hit as soon as there's a there's a temptation or something and i don't know where they go because that love was not actually there that spirit was not actually there that actual protection of god was was not there because they never really believed it may have looked like it sounded like it felt like it played the part blended right in but when that when the trial comes what do they do so yeah there are people that serve god on condition but they're not really serving god those aren't really god's children god's children don't serve god on condition they serve him because they love him period you exist if you're a child of god because of him period we are his children you read the bible you see in first in matthew the first chapter god said jesus said he come to save those that were his he come for his children amen i i had that little snippet of a midweek message there on our website his people that's what it says he came to seek and save his people and not the whole world uh i'm not responsible for my next door neighbor's car in the parking lot but i am responsible for mine i'm not responsible for uh the man down the street's wife but i am responsible for mine i'm not responsible for their life but i am responsible for mine god's responsible for his and his own and that's who he is responsible those who the ones that he has hedged that he has protected that are his own that belong to him and they and he loves them and they love him and we serve him because period there's there well there is no because just because he is no way the way to say it is hey because but it's because of that protection that god give us that we know it's there he doesn't have to do it but he does it because he loves us uh just like when our children were growing up we kept them protected because they were ours they belong to us and now they they they're out living their lives and they have god in their lives and god and the children grandchildren see and so uh they they live their lives in that and then the angels of god are encamped around about them and now their protection is there and now satan can come and do the exact same thing as he does with us all the time as he does with you all the time as he does with our family and say oh i can't get to him because you got him hedged well praise the lord well if we're all hedged then the only way that satan can even try to get to you is if god allows them and if god allows them there's a reason for it there's a reason say the lord why what what did i do what do i need to do where would you have me go from here lord just strengthen me in this trial whatever it is because we'll be closer to him when it's all done said and done at the end of it now this uh one more scripture i want to read to you before i close uh but i want to but i want to read this quote to you i wasn't going to do this but i'm going to do it anyway because brother branham said it so uh you you take it for what he said you can listen to the whole message i don't intend to take this out of context and understand this was 1954. a lot of things that came up in brother brown's life that god revealed to brother branham and things after 1954 but this is a very prevalent uh quote for today so listen he said what is cancer what is a disease we'll deal on that for the next five minutes now what is cancer what's causing that thing let's take a cancer anything you wish to take tuberculosis pneumonia whatever you wish to any disease diseases are germs let me pass something here quickly as our time's going listen did you know the bible predicts or says not really a prediction it's a prophecy the bible uh says prophet prophesies predicts that in the last days that there will be a drum warfare i'm not saying that the covet is a german warfare it could very well be a part of the beginning of that because listen there'll be a german warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the holy ghost think about that but with the angel or who had charged over these plagues was given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was why how much uh kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order in that condition immune now remember what we said a couple weeks ago the last service at the church in revelation 6 when you get revelation 6 i believe verse 4 jesus comes out of the midst of those four beasts and says you can take the wealth of the world you can do what you want to your people but don't you touch my people don't you touch the oil and wine well that's exactly what brother graham's talking about here he's saying that yeah these things are going to break out and they're going to fall out across the world internationally and those diseases will break out upon everybody without the baptism of the holy ghost but now look what he says he says but with the angel and this this and i tell you this to inspire me in my ministry the ministry that's his ministry the lord give but um but but this this one sentence this phrase here he said but the angel or who had charge over these plagues was given orders to touch no to touch no one on whom the mark was why why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brother what kind of ministers what kind of teachers pastors preachers have we got to be brothers to get this church in order to be in that condition the ministers the godly holy ghost five-fold ministry that preached the pure unadulterated word of this hour to get the bride of jesus christ in a place in a condition that this fits them immune he says immune diminished the word remember we talk we we talked about this couple weeks ago the the faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god and bringing faith upon the people through the pure word of god minister to a group of people internationally to get that group of people in a place of rapturing faith to get that church in that condition immune immune what is bringing the immunity it's not just the holy spirit but it's your faith it's your faith in believing that god has you hedged and protected and he's watching over you 24 7 all the time not just when you have to go get a test not just when you feel a symptom not just when there's some kind of calamity all the time those angels are with you all the time what kind of preachers what kind of message have we got to bring to you to raise our faith to that place to get us in the place of faith so that we'll stand in the face of that covet or anything else and said you're a lying devil you've got no place in me my wife my family or anybody that i choose is my my house that's hedged you have no place here god help us help us to somehow live and preach and believe that faith to that place immune immune now this is god's provided way of healing july 19 1954 you want to look it up and read it yourself my arms are so sore now he says from where the doctors has punched needles in to try to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth and brother branham you know he had to take those because he went overseas all the time you go overseas they require those inoculations they have to have documentation to show i've had this immunization before they can go over into foreign countries or they can come here they have to be immunized so brother branham had to take it they said my arm is sore now for taking this he said i told them i didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me it sounds a lot like today i guess but brother battle at that time his arm was sore from taking the inoculations yellow fever and so forth he said i told him i didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me amen but i'll tell you what god's going to do god's got a serum and it's called the holy ghost and when that serum goes in it'll inoculate you praise the lord hallelujah he says for these last days it'll inoculate you praise now that that doesn't help give us a surge of faith to realize those who are listening to this that are born again and filled with his spirit and how the holy ghost living in you through you you recognize and realize god's talking about you this is you this is us help us lord with the faith as i try to verbalize this the best i can what's in my heart and spirit right now to get to you friend at that ministry to bring that faith to a people to understand that satan cannot touch you not without god's permission cannot touch you amen can't touch you wisdom no wisdom whatever it is i'm not i don't worry about that can't touch you one more one more scripture i want to read to you psalms 34. i might could have guessed where i was going to go for my last scripture psalms 34. begin with verse 1 psalms 34 1 we'll close here after this he said i will bless the lord at all times his prey shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears delivered me from all my fears i am delivered from the fear of the devil they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them old taste and see what the lord o tastes and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him why because we know again david says here in the scripture the angel of god encampeth about us all the time it didn't again it wasn't just because those syrians had come to elisha those angels were always there they don't leave on vacation they don't go on lunch breaks they don't even take naps they're always there they are always in encamped around about us they're always there with you whether you can see them with the act natural i or not believe it by faith it takes that surge of faith to know that they are there i had somebody say so you know you know we're protected and catch it and and all and i know we stay away from people friend you're not catching because you stay away from people you're not catching it because god's protecting you that's why you're not catching it that's why god's with you and keeping you from it because god's watching over you and that's my prayer to you that's my standing in the gap for you as a congregation holding back and trusting that the faith the prayer of faith is saving it is protecting amen yes god's a healer but the angels of god are keeping us protected from from the things and it takes a surge it takes up faith to believe that that god is keeping us and protecting us and helping us and it's not just my prayer it's all of our prayer together we pray together pray you one for the other see we all pray together not for healing we're not looking to healing now we have prayer requests and we first need healing time protection i'm talking about god keeping us those angels watching over us that hedge that's around us angel of god and camping around about us doing away with the fear now you notice there in that passage there's two fears there's the original fear which is which is a a a a torment fear uh which is from the devil the second fear is the angel of the lord and camp round about those that fear him that's the reverence and love that we have towards god as is two different fears let's use the same word one's for poor men and the other is to bring faith see reverence that we fear the lord that we trust him and believe him and that's our faith towards him that we believe god's keeping you god's watching over god's blessing us god's providing for us what we have need of god is always there believe that search of faith that surge of faith is there for you i'm going to believe it and forget about the search of hope that's that's i'm not i'm not concerned about that i'm concerned about god's protection and watching over and keeping us i mean i've known people men of men of god children of god i've known some like brother jim and brother joel's passed away from it that were that were godly men and i believe them to be and love them but then and there's a reason why that happened i don't know why i can't explain it but i believe what i pray and i believe what i pray for my family and i believe what i pray for my children for my church and i believe that and we pray and believe for one another and and trust god in that amen i believe god's hand is upon you let's let that surge of faith take a hold of the bride because there's nothing but a surge of fear that's taking hold this world taking a hold of this country you know a lot of the things that's happened has been things that we talk about as far as our country united states from but this is something that's that's an international thing and it's got and it has to take something international to bring in an international um counter to it and not only that but it's got to take an international uniting of god's ride because this rapture is an international rapture this is a bringing together of god's children and we're going to go to meet him meet the lord in the air i'd be honest with you probably more than ever and i've been preaching this for years i'm more anticipation of seeing my loved ones appear at any time than i have ever been in my life can feel that pull uh greater than i've ever felt in my life i believe it gets stronger i believe it will as this time continues to march forward you look at our nation we got an inauguration coming up wednesday friend and the only thing i can believe i hope it's not true the only thing i can believe is the man that's getting in there is going to follow in the footsteps of the man that he was the vice president for who was a hater of israel turned this nation against israel for eight years fortunately we had four years of a president that loved israel and made it israel showed his alliance with israel and blessed israel and we know the scripture that when you bless israel god blesses you you curse israel god curses you this nation is about to start cursing israel again friend well we know what's in store for it so uh but we trust and believe that god is taking care of us there's some tremendous transition happening right now but the greatest transition i'm looking for is a translation and that's this bride go home so amen pray the lord bless you today appreciate you watching being here or listening i don't know if you ever got to watch it on video hopefully some of you did found it the numbers went up anyway a little bit but uh sorry for the confusion i don't know what happened but anyway next week we'll be in person will be a live two five four four north country club and i hope all you can make it again after we get done with the service next sunday got something very important to talk to you about so pray the lord bless you through the week god keep you
