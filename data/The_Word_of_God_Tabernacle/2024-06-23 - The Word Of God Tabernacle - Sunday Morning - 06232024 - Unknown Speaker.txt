did we serve a living God a god that is risen the only God there's leaders of other religions are waiting for them to rise but ours Jesus Christ has risen but not only has he risen he has come to live in the hearts of his people and no other religion can test that that my leader lives in my heart if they do they're blind or deceived father and we want to be right take redeem the time for the days

Romans chapter 3 we'll read a few verses of scripture here to draw a context from I'm going speak on missing the Mark today we uh finished up last time with the the mind and this has been a thought that been on my heart for a while so wanted to bring this today probably continue on if you will it might not be in the same um title as we go along through this and just see where the Lord goes with it but for today we'll just begin with this Romans chapter 3 uh verse 19 Romans 3:19 before we read just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're so very thankful father Your Grace your mercy the blessings love that you give us thank you Lord for this Fellowship thank you Lord for this place and the time that we have God to come in from out of the world to Worship You To Praise You Lord God to open back the pages of this holy RIT God that we could read it and feel blessed to know God that this word is is you in letter form that you spoke to us that you gave to us that we could see in it Lord the things that we need to know that make you happy Lord the the ways that we could act the the moralities that we can live and the things that we can do Lord that would be pleasing to you yes because our whole life Lord surrendered to you God is desired to to be led by you Lord to be pleasing to you God may you just bless it father today may you bless remain part of this service bless those those who are here today those who weren't able to make it God we just believe that you're still the miracle workking God to move on every request every need every heart every life every sickness you are still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you are still the great physician the sympathizing Jesus Lord who is here to do exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think believing Lord that your word is true we stand on that word today God may you just help us now Lord as we come into this part of the service and just Trust You Lord to take complete full control of this body these lips our ears each one of us God to accomplish that that you had this service pre-ordained for before the foundation of the world yes whatever purpose that it might be for every one of us God let us fulfill that purpose Lord we commit it to you Lord ask your blessings now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Romans chapter 3 we'll begin reading with verse 19 Romans 3:19 amen now listen Clos here now we know that what things soever the law say it say to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of God without the law is Manifest being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believeth for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God you could be seated if you'd like looking at that word s today as some of you may have already gathered by the title missing the mark looking at that word sin has been mentioned here a couple of times as Paul did to the Romans in this letter mentioned the word sin a couple of times sin is the word that means to well one of the uh things that it means is to miss the mark amen sin is to miss the mark uh to to do wrong to transgress uh an overstepping of the law uh the law is set because that was God's mind that was God's thought that was that's the things that we know that that was laid down in the scripture for us to follow uh for them back in the Old Testament to follow was to be the law it came apparent very quickly as God already knew obviously that humans cannot follow the law right it's just not possible we we fall we fail we make mistakes all the time we're born in sin shap become the world speaking Li so we fall short of that Mark continually we fall short of that of that Target see that Target is is that if you will that Target is that law amen that's the Target that we all shoot for that Target is is what we know that God laid out is uh Thou shalt not Thou shalt not uh that we know that God has put forth that's the mark That's the Target that we're shooting for and we all still uh shoot in that direction amen a lot of people think that when Jesus Christ came and shed his blood that it did away with the law not realizing that what he did was magnify the law he brought the L he brought a greater light onto the law because once there was uh a Grace given to the law then it helped us understand really what the consequences of the law was right but when the grace came it came even more boldly to understand that we are to live uh a Godly life A Life That's pleasing to the Lord uh to to sin is to transgress or to overstep the mark to miss the mark amen but the thing is today that I'd like to get to and I want to read back through this scripture again but the thing I want to get to today is that the world uh doesn't seem to care about missing the mark amen the only the only ones that really care about missing the mark missing uh the Target that God has set the only ones that really seem to care those that are Christians right amen the world doesn't seem to care uh they think that because they missed the mark uh they can just move the mark amen you can't move the mark you don't move the target amen if there's something wrong with shooting at the Target you got to fix the problem and the problem's not the target the target is just there as a stationary item for you to aim at you don't move the target but everybody thinks that the way to solve the problem is to move the Target right amen well uh I I I can't I can't hit this Mark so I'm going to move the target to make it fit doesn't work that way if you miss the mark you don't move the target you fix the problem the problem is me yes the problem is us the problem is Humanity not the mark not what God set as the target for us that's not the problem amen the problem is us and we miss that Mark but now look uh it's very poignant that he writes out here that we know that the things going back to the 19th verse again now now we know that the things which there uh things soever the law saith it sayth to them that are under the law amen whatever the whatever is saying is saying to those that are under the law amen now now if you're going down Oracle the speed limit is 45 if you're going down Oracle you're under that law right you're not under the law of the speed limit of Oracle if you're driving down river amen right you're not under Oracle law you're under River law right amen and River I'm not sure what it is probably still 45 but let's just say it's 30 if you get on River the river the River Road is 30 for example it's not I think it's 45 but uh just speaking hypotheticals the law that you have that you're under when you're under writing down Oracle you're under that law but once you turn on the river you're no longer under the law of Oracle you're under the law of river amen now you see when when you come out from under that law only those that are under that is the law speaking to the cop cannot stop you going down river and say the speed liement on Oracle 45 he can't do that that's that that is not a righteous way to judge a person by some other standard the only standard that you have when you're driving down river is what's what is on river right not what is on Oracle yes amen what is on Oracle now when the law speaks is speaking to those that are under it amen not those that aren't under it so understand those that are under the law as it speaks those things that the law law says it's saying to them that are under that law amen not to those that are not under the law now when you're going through life and you're under and and and you haven't accepted Christ you mean we're all under that law amen you're you're under the law to live by that to live by those rules and regulations and and anybody that wants to decide to reject Jesus Christ then you're sitting under that law but once you go in life and you recognize that Christ is the way Christ is the truth he's the way he's the life when you realize that and you turn that corner and you start going a different path and that's the path of righteousness the path of godliness the path that Jesus Christ would send you down you're no longer on this path you've turned the corner you're going down a different Road you're you're going down the path of of of Jesus Christ you you you've left not left uh but you you've turned a corner from strict law to being under grace yes amen now that doesn't mean that we don't obey the law that doesn't mean that the law loses effect doesn't have any effect but you're not under the law because the because the law has no effect on you anymore now you go down Oracle I hope I'm making sense with this if you go down the Oracle and you go under the speed limit the law has no effect on you amen amen none cop can't stop you nobody can give you a ticket nobody can write you up for doing anything wrong and if you're under this speed liit if you're if you're obeying the law the law doesn't apply to you amen amen it only applies if you're breaking it if you're going over it if you're transgressing it if you're missing the mark That's when a cop can stop you right amen but now when you go and you turn the corner and you go down the way of Christ the blood grace mercy love forgiveness uh sins gone amen what are you under you're not under that law amen you're under grace yes now that doesn't mean that we just sin willfully because we can oh God will forgive me no we don't take the grace of God and make a disgrace out of it because what does it do now look let's continue on it is only a law to those who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God so that just stops all the discussion that stops all the chatter it stops all the excuses well I got an excuse for this and I got an excuse for that and whatever else and you know the world's full of excuses today and unfortunately we become a society that accepts excuses in instead of holding people accountable to what their actions are uh which is a very sad thing but it stops all the mouth it stops all the Talking it stops all the reasoning all that's gone because you're under the law the law says if you go 46 and a 45 you're guilty Amen period you're guilty okay therefore by the Deeds by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight because you cannot be justified by a law you cannot be made as though you never did it amen which is Justified in the sight of God by simple law amen amen if the cop gives you a ticket that's on your record they might not you might can go to traffic court and not get any points on your license or no points on on insurance they may give you a little Grace if you will Grace for breaking the law amen traffic court is Grace for breaking the law it says I'm not I'm going to I'm going to charge you a penalty but I'm not going to do this and I'm not going to do this I'm going to let it I'm going to let it slide if you will but you got to go to traffic court whatever they even do that anymore I don't even know if they do anymore Anyway by the grace of God I haven't gotten a ticket in a long time thank the Lord uh but you but but the law does not justify you amen because then it says but it still goes on your record to say you did it amen justification says you never did it praise the Lord so under the understanding the Deeds of the law there can no flesh be justified amen because it'll always be there that you did it amen and justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin amen without without the law without God saying don't do this we didn't know it was wrong to do that right amen how would you know it's wrong to do something if there's isn't something there that says don't do it amen When God says don't do it then you understand that's something that you shouldn't do to please the Lord amen so you know that that's something and that knowledge brings about a transgression if there's not a knowledge of it there's no transgression there's no law if there's nothing there that God says don't do this then how can you transgress something that doesn't exist right it has to exist so the knowledge brought the the law brought a knowledge of sin don't understand that if you if you if that law is there and you miss that and you transgress it you've missed the mark you you sinned you've done wrong in the eyes of God you've done wrong in the in in the eyes of the law uh and in this case in the eyes of God you've done wrong amen when you've done wrong then you've missed the Mark when you missed the mark you don't go dig up the the speed liit sign and say Excuse me sir I think this should be 55 and just dig up the speed limit sign and and or or or take a piece of black tape and change the four to a five and say well 55 now amen that's what the world does though right you don't take black paint and try to paint over the four and make it a five and say okay speed limit now is 55 I didn't break the law yes you did because your mouth is shut remember you don't have a thought the law is 45 I don't care if you change the sign or not it's still 45 right amen but that's what people try to do they try to tape over the sign or bait the sign and make it fit their lives amen just saying that you can't live it doesn't make it not a effect right amen a lot of people say that but that's the truth amen you you can't change the speed limit simply because you can't drive it you can't you don't change the speed limit just because you can't drive it you don't change the scripture just because you can't live it right I've heard so many times people say well believe it I just can't live it then you don't believe it that that's my opinion yes amen if you believe it you're going to live it because to to believe something to have a revelation of something is is to be a part of you of who you are amen that's that that's like me saying I can't live the life of a white man I I I don't know the life of a white man I that that's just foolishness I live the life of a white man because I'm a white man amen right if if you're a Christian you believe it you know it's the truth and and and can't live it can't drive it then you're a transgressor of the law right God's not going to move that Mark for you psych story I think I told y'all one time about a sales consultant a man who used to call on us at at uh when I worked in business in Charlotte and was puring manager he' come in and talk to the old purchasing manager after I had got hired and he was talking to him about trying to start go to church he said church is like a glove you just find one that fits you I said man what a lie of the devil that is yes amen amen I don't go somewhere to try to find something that's going to fit me right amen I go somewhere that I'm going to change to fit him amen I want to be the one to change I want to be the one to be molded Into His Image I don't want his image to be molded to me oh my what a mess that would be right amen I I want to go go someplace that I'm going to be molded where the words preach that I'm going to be molded not something that's a glove that fit on a hand just go with whatever fits you doesn't work that way amen this is the glove amen put it on it doesn't fit change your life to where it will fit amen cuz that's the only thing that's going to be acceptable to God anything else is missing the mark right amen any other way you've missed the mark amen it's got to be God's way or it's or it's or it's no way so without without a knowledge of the law there is no sin there's no transgress if there's not something to say don't do it amen now let's go 21 21st verse but now but now look now we're getting ready to we're getting ready to make that turn on the river but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested praise the lord it's been uncovered it's been revealed it's been made known that the righteousness of God is with without the law is manifested praise the Lord what is the righteousness of God it's a pure existence of who God is amen it's not even necessarily an attribute of God it is it is just who God is amen and when you come into that place through the grace of God Amen through the blood of of Jesus Christ and through the grace of God and you come into that place of righteousness then there is nothing praise the Lord there's absolutely nothing that can be held guilty to your charge nothing the grace of God and the and the and the and the blood the of the annihilating of sin brings you into a place to where you are completely totally guilty Justified is though you never done it in the first place amen praise God you've turned a corner now amen and that corner has brought you onto the street of righteousness and that righteousness of God now that is without the law why is it without the law the same reason that if you're driving 44 to 45 the law has no effect on you amen yes you're living the life of God the law has no effect on you why because you don't steal because you don't commit adultery amen because you don't lie because you don't do amen amen if if you don't do these if you don't steal then then the law Thou shalt not steal has no effect on you amen amen just like going 44 and 45 has no effect on you what is that now that is the righteousness of God right now what happens now if if we do happen to transgress in some way because of our Humanity or our carnality the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ is there and you and you just ask God for forgiveness right amen you ask God for forgiveness and God is just and faithful to forgive praise the Lord amen and now the right it doesn't affect the righteousness of God because of who you are yes because of your status of sunship in Jesus Christ yes you don't lose any anything as a result because of the righteous because now the righteousness of God because of Jesus Christ the righteousness of God has now been manifested the righteousness of God without the law being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen friends that is without the law the faith in Jesus Christ the righteousness of God is without the law amen unto all of them that believe for there is no difference for all have Sinn all have missed the mark and come short of the glory of God right now what is the problem that so many times people have today don't want to do it I I I mentioned uh I believe it can't live it doesn't exist believe it don't want to live it I I can believe that but believe it can't live it I don't believe am because there's too many people I know that do live it amen and to say you can't live it when so many other people do live it it doesn't hold water with me amen you say I believe it and I don't want to live it that's a whole another story that I'll believe amen amen you just don't want to right amen that's where willful Disobedience comes in right I will just go find me a church or someone where the gloves going to fit me no then you've you've you've brought yourself I'm sorry friend this may sound hard but you have brought yourself at at that moment you have brought yourself outside of the economy of God yes right amen you've brought yourself outside of the cony of God yes instead of making excuses just own up to it amen I I I know I truly believe as I speak as a man I truly believe God will respect that more than he would the other the excuses let's go over to St Luke let's read a very familiar story amen Luke chapter 15 Luke chapter 15 verse 17 about prodical son of course very familiar scripture read amen chapter 15 has so many wonderful lessons in here and when he look now and when he the prodical son came to himself I just love that part amen when he comes to realize who he was amen he wasn't a popper he wasn't a beggar he wasn't a street uh uh urant whatever they call he was the son of a king amen amen and when he come to realize he wasn't a pig with his head in the SLO he he he wasn't a a beggar poer he come to realize he was the son of a king yes amen he knew he was the son of the king amen amen and when he come to realize that when he come to himself when he came to himself because himself was always according to his Birthright that's who himself was himself was always and there's and you cannot change it amen no matter how much uh uh my parents might have wanted to disown me they could not do it amen impossible POS all you need today is a simple DNA test that could tell that George Jim Bennett Jr was my papa there's no denying it amen could change my name they could change Theirs Whatever but there's no way you could deny my DNA said that I was his son can't change it myself that's who I am himself himself when he came to himself himself was according to his Birthright amen and his Birthright was he was the son of this King this man yes amen I don't know if he was a king but he was the son of this rich man and there's no way that that could be changed no matter what he did no matter where he went no matter what he said no matter how hard he wanted to distance himself no matter how much he sinned no matter how hard he sinned no matter how deep he went into sin didn't matter didn't change his Birthright at all so when he came to himself himself was always he was the son of the this man this rich man amen so when he came to himself he realized he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him father I did this because I didn't like my brother I did this because I have ADHD I did this because I had this disease I did this because excuse Excuse excuse Excuse excuse that's exactly what people do today oh this person's insane well yeah they're insane they just killed somebody well this person they have this well that makes them okay well they were underprivileged they were disadvantaged they were this that and the other whatever excuse one no no no had nothing to do excuses when he said in himself I will arise to go to my father and say to him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee no excuses pure simple repentance that's all it was that's all God expects God's not looking for excuses he's looking for Pure simple repentance I'm sorry I truly didn't mean to do that I'm sorry I truly didn't mean to act that way talk whatever it was whether it's an initial repentance from from sinner to Saint from or just repentance of your normal everyday life amen sure simple repentance I did this because no no no no no because I did this and I'm sorry right amen forgive me Father it's that simple right not complicated it's not hard need to you need to believe it from your heart though you need to mean it from your heart it needs to be it needs to be sincere not just listen well I'm I I've seen I we did it with our children I've seen it even this week with tabith and the kids uh say you're sorry sorry no you're not sorry you don't know I'm talking about tell her you're sorry sorry no you're that's not a sorry it's got you got to it's got to be from the heart you got to mean it amen you don't just look at God and say I'm sorry you know getall come back I don't want to have anything do with this anyway that's not that's not repentance right repentance is a sincere sorrowful attitude that you have in your heart towards God to say I did not mean to transgress I did not mean to go down this road make a mistake miss the mark Lord forgive me I'm sorry forgive me it's that simple this Rich Young Ruler uh this uh uh particle son he had that he he had got to the place when he came to himself he realized I'm I am the son of this man and I'm just going to go repent and I'm going to say I'll be the door matat if I can just be in your house again oh praise the Lord amen praise the Lord I have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of th hard servants he arose came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him I just that's just my vision of what I saw Jesus did for me when I came to him yes amen he knew I was coming and ran and fell on my neck and I felt such a warm presence amen amen praise the Lord Jesus putting himself that Spirit coming in you Amen to me brother brandom talked about a rain pelting experience to me it was like the the sun itself had come into my into my body it it was like something Indescribable right it just like the entire Sun that hangs out in the sky here came right into my body right that's just what it felt like praise the Lord kissed him and the son said as he rear said the son said unto him father I have sinned against Heaven I've missed the mark against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son amen but what the man didn't understand understand and what sometimes we don't understand is you don't have to be worthy to be the Son of God if you're a Son of God you're a Son of God this man was he was the son of this man he was the son of this rich man amen worthiness had nothing to do with it amen I could have been the worst son ever on the planet but my worthiness had nothing to do with my d D in my Birthright my father being George inett Jr had nothing to do with it worthiness had nothing to do with the position I have in Jesus Christ right God praise God now we desire to live a life that's worthy of the Gospel obviously but your sunship your Birthright your position in Christ has nothing to do with your worthiness right it's not about us anyway about him it's not about what I've done it's about what he's done it's not about who I am it's about who he is that's right praise God then what does it matter my worthiness is filthy rags anyway like brother Dennis prayed any of the best good righteous great Deeds I can ever try to offer to God is filthy rags in his side amen just nothing I could do anyway so many places so many people so many religions it's about what they do it's not about what I do it's about what he's done thank you Lord praise God it's about what Christ has already done for me amen that makes me who I am not my worthiness because my worthiness is nothing it's not my righteousness my righteousness is nothing it's all about him his righteousness his righteousness that has become you that now has turned the corner going down river and you're right there in line the grace of God is riding right along with youall amen and that grace of God is keeping you in line with the word of God staying with every bit and when we do transgress when we do maybe miss that Mark a little bit God forgive me we do like the prodical son and say I'm sorry Lord forgive me amen repent make it right if you got to go somebody else if your transgression you see he said against heaven and against you you he repented for that if it's a transgression against somebody go to that person right ask forgiveness I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend you amen a lot of times a person offends somebody don't even know they offended them but if you do go to them if they tell you go to them tell them I'm sorry just repent just be sorrowful our our horrible human pride is one of the worst hindrance we have in life because it it it prevents us so many times from telling the truth and just repenting yes and just being sorrowful and asking for forgiveness amen yes they may not forgive you Humanity a person's Humanity they may not forgive you but that's not on you that's on them now right mean you've done your part to forgive the good thing is God is just and faithful to forgive praise the Lord so when you ask forgiveness of him you repent it's made right amen you become into the righteousness of God now the father 22nd verse the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe put it on him put a ring on his hand shoes on his feet bring Heather the fatty calf and kill it let us eat and be married for my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and his found and they began to be married praise the Lord amen something just as simple as repentance he didn't try to move the mark he didn't try to move the target he didn't try to make it a different thing that that uh that that was unattainable no or or or easier if you will In the Flesh no just he fixed what what was wrong what was wrong wasn't the target so many times people try to rewrite the scripture because they think the word is wrong this isn't wrong right amen it's me that's wrong right praise the Lord let me read this key to the door 196 October 1962 Hebrews the 12th chapter says seeing we are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight every weight and the unbelief that does so easily easily beset us it says Sin Sin which is unbelief only one sin and that's unbelief right amen and sin means to miss the mark he says now he gives this analogy like you're shooting you missed the mark he said you better adjust your gun not move the Mark if I put my tri uh sight right on the bullseye and it shoots over to or three Ines if I move the target over and I put it on the bullseye again what's it going to do it's going to miss again am I I don't I don't take and then aim it down two or three inches to try to hit the center no just fix the gun just fix the problem Amen brother says you better adjust your gun fix the fix the gun amen fix this make it right repent do like the prodical son I'm sorry make it right yes amen then you can hit that Mark and you can hit that uh uh uh Mark that was put there for you see because there's something wrong you've missed the mark come back try over it means to turn around you've missed the mark make it right turn around when you want to be a Christian you go to joining Church go to join a church to be a Christian he says you've missed the mark you want to be Christian and be sprinkled in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost you've missed the mark amen amen why because that's not the scripture right amen praise the Lord there's only one thing you can hold that it's perfect in line and that's the scripture the Bible the word for heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away yes amen holds it in perfect in perfect stead amen now Romans uh Romans chapter 6 Romans chapter 6 I'm going to close in a few minutes here but let's go Roman Romans chapter 6 what uh verse one Romans 61 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid amen Grace is only there to cover because of the understanding that humans cannot live the law by the letter if a person person wants to shun Christ and the blood and Grace and try to live under the law then they're under the law amen everything about it they have to live that law they have to live it right they have to live it to a team amen but it says now shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin dead to sin live any longer therein see if you're dead to sin are you under the law because of righteousness are we under the law because the the righteousness of God is now manifested without the law right amen for ye know that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also walk in newness of light praise the Lord by the blood of Jesus Christ and if we walk in newness of life in the righteousness that is God if we walk in that righteousness what desire do you have to continue to sin the question was shall we continue to sin that excuse me that Grace May abound well if you're walking in the right righteousness of Jesus Christ you don't want to miss the mark amen you don't want to sin there is no abounding of sin you don't want to sin anymore that's the whole point amen for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not not serve sin amen amen for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we now now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death has no more dominion over him praise the Lord God which is perfect in line to understand what the law and Grace is about amen a lot of times we do it like it's a competition there's not competition between law and Grace right there is no competition amen amen knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more he's not dying again it it's like I had a brother we spent a lot of time with good friend and uh it was told that he was a different understanding of the message and we kind of pushed it to the side for a long time just had Fellowship as brothers and then he calls me up one night I guess this is probably probably the last time I ever talked to him actually and he was trying to bring that in I guess this was kind of his make or break moment is either newon was going to believe this or we were going to set part ways that's his decision not mine CU I don't believe that right if you're my brother you're my brother I don't care this that and the other I may differ with you but you're still my brother as far as I'm concerned amen someone wants depart from you that's their decision but he brought up this quote or this thing that brother random said about a woman that saw him being shot in the parking lot this brother actually believed that brother Brown was going to raise from the dead and be shot by a woman in the parking lot I said okay so uh this accident happens he passes away work finished passes away so he's going to eventually 60 years later now as of now he's going to raise back from the dead just so he can go to a uh I think it was Kmart we don't even have Kmarts anymore anyway parking lot and get shot and die again and you know no answer I it just some of the reasoning just baffles me but I I wasn't cond hope I pray I wasn't condescending I wasn't any of that just wanted to understand uh do you really believe this well the scripture says knowing Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more he died and raised from the dead was he going to die again raise again die again raise again I mean it it comes to a point to where even human common sense is compromised right it it it just doesn't ring true doesn't forgive me but it just doesn't make any sense anyway so knowing that Christ see being raised from the dead dieth no more death has because death now then has no more dominion over him praise the Lord that's amen it seems plain to me but I guess it just isn't always plain to everybody right my wife has to remind me of that all the time for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord now he preached that a lot even to the Ephesian Church which is just wonderful we spoke a little bit the other day let not sin therefore reain in your mortal body that you should obey it the lust thereof you don't want to that's the whole point of it see neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not for ye are sin missing the Mark has no dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace amen praise the Lord What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid it's making it very clear to say well to me it's very clear amen the understanding of say are you are you under the law no we're not under the law because of Grace right then it says well shall we continue to sin to let grace abound how can you sin if you're no longer under the law that's like going down Oracle with no speed limit if the city has not declared or sign put a signage that there's no speed limit on Oracle you can go as fast as you want there's no law nobody give you a ticket nobody can hold you accountable guilty there because there's nothing there so you you see where Paul's trying to bring it around to help them understand and I hope that makes sense here this morning What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey that's the whole point whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness if your desire is to do something then yeah you can say well I believe it but I I I just don't want to live it well you just want to live how you want to live amen it it that's your choice you can you can do however you want to but don't just say you know I I can't do something you know you can you just don't want to amen those who yield their s refer you know see y yield yourselves your members uh yield yourselves to O servants to obey uh his servants ye are to whom you obey amen if it's to obey sin and lust and well then you just you you fall right under that law right amen and if you're going to try to fall under the one you fall under all of it you can't just you can't just yield into one and say well I'm going to go under it for this one no the Bible says say you go under one you're guilty of one you're guilty of all right you can't just go and say well I'm just going to nullify this one and just go under here and it just be this no you can't do just that if you're under that one you're under all of it amen because you have you have rejected the blood of Jesus Christ and the grace that he gives right and once you've rejected that you have nothing left but law you have nothing left but judgment amen that's all that's left at that point see you've come under the place to where there is uh uh there is no Grace anymore once you're rejected right under the law to miss the mark amen don't move the mark don't change the mark don't change the don't change the speed limit it is what it is God said it God said it amen and if God said it then that's the way it is amen you don't change it it is the way he said iten that's the whole problem we have with some other uh uh well religions uh they they they want to go by a pope that says well uh we know the Bible says this but the Pope says this I don't care what the Pope says right yeah couldn't care less I want to know what God Said Amen and this is what God says amen not the pope not a fallible man who's influenced by we know don't know what who or where his influence comes from I don't care what he says if it's against this he's wrong right right amen this is the mark amen that's what we always shoot for we don't move it we don't change it I don't I don't have a bottle of white out in my desk that I that I white stuff out and Mark over I don't I don't own white out for my Bible I don't have a bottle of white out at my study desk no it is what it is it says what it says and it says what it means and that's what we obey amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen help us Lord not to miss that Mark to stay on the straight narrow you make that mistake amen do we repent God I'm sorry yes no excuse amen no blaming it on somebody else amen I don't you don't blame don't even blame it on the devil know years ago when I was when I was a young kid maybe Gabriel's age Joel's age uh 8 nine 10 years old it was just big saying going my my sister even had a shirt maybe even had a license plate I don't know the devil made me do it no he didn't amen I that was those who old enough to remember probably remember that that same in the 70s the devil made me do it no no the devil didn't make you do anything you were influenced and chose to do it yes amen that's that that is a complete fallacy the devil didn't make you do anything you did it because you wanted to he gave you an inroads to be able to do it yes amen praise the Lord let's sing this course I want to live the way he wants me to live amen it's in the song book here Michael put it on the screen for us I want to live the way he wants me to live praise the Lord that's all of our hearts desire if we're Christians today that's what we want to do is live the way he wants us to live amen praise the Lord Jesus our hearts desire Lord help us let's sing it to him now I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love oh I could never ever out love the Lord oh yes let's sing it again I want to live the way Jesus wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love oh I could never ever out love my Lord oh can we see him one more time now yes I want to live the way Jesus wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love oh I could never ever out love my Lord amen praise the Lord Jesus help us oh God live that life that is pleasing to you amen our whole heart's desire is to be a life live a life be a person that is pleasing to him amen amen and all the we do let us be pleasing to the Lord amen praise the Lord and when we do maybe again miss that Mark a little we just God forgive me yes amen repentance praise the Lord I believe brother green used to say repentance is the best bargain a Christian ever got any say think he said didn't he say that yeah amen praise the Lord just repent God I'm sorry forgive me amen praise the Lord God bless you something
