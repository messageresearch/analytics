lord i received yes lord i received lord i received all things are possible lord i received amen amen praise the lord jesus you know there's one thing about it saints people believe a lot of people say they believe amen but it takes a belief to really receive amen when you believe it to the receiving of it then it becomes you yes when you receive it it becomes a part of you praise the lord a lot of people believe it they say they believe it but they won't receive it to themselves so that it makes them and shapes them and changes them into the thing to what the scripture says what god wants us to be amen when we receive it praise the lord that's when it becomes you know that's what brother branham said was the evidence of the holy ghost receiving the word for your day yes amen receiving the revealed word that's that's the evidence of the holy ghost amen not just the people say they believe it satan believes it yes but when you receive it praise the lord amen brother graham said if satan were to receive it he'd become your brother amen he'd come through the blood and become your brother amen praise the lord which he was an angel of light like we said last week at one time he was an angel i praise the lord he was brother to them amen we've had several prayer requests to mention today so we'll just get to these here brother dennis has a prayer request said please pray for leah his wife of course this morning she woke up with a sore throat and feeling really bad also for her step dad andy is that correct andy her stepdad he is very weak and sickly at 87 years old uh very hard on her mother amen so we'll remember that sister leah her stepdad and mother of course in prayer sister leah woke up not feeling good today just remember that brother danny has a request here says my youngest son who is only 25 25 years old has a family of three daughters and a wife praying that he and his family will find the lord before it is too late he is not spiritual at all and for his children children's sake hoping that there is more to life than making a living and having a good time amen brother that's the truth praise the lord people could just understand and realize what a good time really is uh then they would come to the lord it's the only good time i know of praise the lord you know i was talking i forgot i was talking to the other day of just so many people in the past few days talking to i think it's sister vicki we stopped and saw sister vicki hyatt up in phoenix when we went up friday and she said i just don't know how people can do this without the lord how they can put up with it how they can live through it how they can sustain i said well uh i don't either but i think a lot of people they either a lot of people kill themselves but most people just drown themselves in alcohol or drugs or something that's that's the only way they can sustain life they think that's living sustaining life is from the bottom of a bottle but thank god i know better amen let's get my stimulation from the revelation of the holy spirit amen amen praise the lord sister norma has a request please pray for daniel and then you all know i made our pulpit here he's come to church here with us a time or two please pray for daniel he has a bad infection in his tooth face is swollen also his daughter is very ill and doctors don't know what's going on or what's wrong with it amen so let's remember daniel uh in prayer the lord blessed him to be able to bless us here amen so we'll remember him in prayer too the lord would just touch him amen with this request we want to remember sister sheila this morning i have a whole list i had to begin to write them down i knew there was no way i would remember everyone with all that's going on so but sister shelia texted me earlier she woke up i had a bad night uh last night woke up at 3am and uh she's feeling much much better but she's just after the bad night she had and not being able to sleep she can't hardly keep her eyes open so she said she would be streaming today so god bless you sister sheila if you're watching we're praying for her amen also want to continue remember brother charlie i was hoping maybe sister teresa will be here today give us an update on brother charlie as far as i know as of a couple of days ago it was kind of the same uh up and down a little bit his option will go up in the 90s and it'll drop back down but to my knowledge he's still breathing on his own so everything that's going on in him he's doing it on his own he hasn't been intubated or sedated anymore or put in a coma or anything like they usually do with a lot of those but he's healed so that's not going to happen anyway but uh please continue to remember brother charlie in prayer if you would just praying for that breathing on his own in oxygen to get up in the 90s and stay right amen see him here with us and amen trust the lord would bless him i also found out this week that brother paul sarshay come down with the bad uh cold and brother wilson hembree as well so please remember them in prayer i also found out sister joyce dougal had pneumonia was in the hospital so as please remember sister joyce in prayer as well we want to remember brother ralph and his family to be a family in prayer i had the the memorial service yesterday for uh for his mother he met at agt and uh it was uh it was a good service i appreciated being there meeting the family again i had forgotten uh i don't know how i forgot but it's been 11 12 years since we've been out of school but so many of the young ones that were there came to the tlc so i knew half the people that were there uh but uh it was a real blessing and uh to get to see the different ones again so but please remember brother ralph and the via family in prayer uh also continue or please remember sister vicki hyatt i mentioned to you friday um she's looking for a place up in washington she had moved in with her son dace and then circumstances changed they came to tucson she was in phoenix anyway i won't make a long story but um she's wanted to she's with some friends in phoenix now and she wants to move back to washington but she can't move back in with her son and all the apartments and everything within three towns are all full can't find a place for her to live so he's hunting for her a place she's hunting the place so just pray the lord would open some place for us she's going to be in phoenix till at least the first of march so please remember her in prayer if you would amen she looked really good those you know sister vicky um mountain folk over here so thank you sister vicky y'all might know sister piggy too i remember sister vicki and jack jack hyatt you remember jack his wife yeah okay praise the lord well that's who i'm talking about please remember her in prayer if you would uh lord would just bless her uh sister as you know sister priscilla came through her procedure well uh she's doing good awake god blessed her the doctor did the doctor actually did not give her a very good chance of waking back up from the anesthesia but the surgery went well took three and a half four hours i forgot what he told me three and a half hours so it took a long time as parts of her intestinal colon that was inflamed so much that the doctor was afraid if she scraped it the wrong way or mis moved somewhere that it would rupture it and be even worse so god bless the doctor in this case uh that took her time and went in and the operation was successful and he punctured it draining it so thankful for that unfortunately the doctor went out of town and of course priscilla came back woke back up praise the lord so we're thankful to god for that that's a miracle saints to me i consider it that way but then the doctor went out of town and she left instruction for her team and for the nurses not to give priscilla very much pain meds so last yesterday last night sister priscilla was in extreme excruciating pain and they couldn't get a hold of the doctor nobody was allowed to change the order uh brother uh angel mentioned a couple of nurses to me so i want to call their name out here that was so kind to sister priscilla um let me see if i could find their names here christine and lydia were the two nurses names that really took after priscilla to help her to do they what they could to get her meds and antibiotics up to word some painkiller to make her comfortable um they actually finally they did it themselves they actually moved it and they weren't supposed to a doctor came in and assessed it and he put it to work she could be comfortable uh he talked to priscilla this morning she felt sounded much better she wasn't in this much pain discomfort of course but not in the pain that she was so thank god for that she can now eat clear liquids uh not solids yet but coming up soon and he says of course according with the doctor said when she's able to start eating and passing uh having bowel movements she can go home so we're going to pray that's going to be very quick amen so she can go home i'm just of the advocacy that a hospital is no place for sick people the best place to get well is at home you want to get well go home as quickly as you possibly can you get well faster at home than you do in a hospital my humble opinion i'm not a doctor physician or anything but from my experience with what i've seen and visit hospitals or visit people seen people in hospitals and all and people get the sicknesses while they're in the hospital i've seen people get well and stay in the hospital and get sick again while they're there just go home get well that's that's my motto uh so we're hoping praying i'm hoping pray she goes home and that uh and then she gets well amen so praise the lord brother angel gave a little more exhort exhortation in that text but you got the gist and we're very thankful god bless sister priscilla god touched her healed her amen uh also one more my wife's client kay she was mine and her client that she takes around to doctor's appointments and things got a bad infection sore on her ankle foot uh and was hoping it was going to get better and go away been treating it but it's getting worse uh so that's how i got her to begin with well through somebody else but she had sores on her that i took her to the wound care center and those for some reason on her they just don't heal quickly so her name is kay again um i guess she's in her 80s but sonia takes her around the doctor's appointment shop for a little bit things like that so uh please remember k in prayer if you would lord would just touch that ankle and help make it better amen praise the lord amen so we're thankful for that you have my unspoken requests man i think we covered pretty much amen sister matisse not with us again today she's not feeling well either so let's please remember her in prayer she's still having uh feeling a little feverish so just just continue to pray for sister matisse as well amen so let's stand to our feet if we could amen will take these needs of the lord in prayer i believe the lord hears our prayer answers our prayer amen and his his ear is turned to the crowd the righteous today praise the lord so amen we thank the lord for that brother pat would you pray for us in these needs today brother lord would you know you are the healer yes no you want to take care of us and keep us yes jesus and we have needs we ask for these needs to be taken care of by the precious god and we appreciate all of you we've already been taken care of by you continuously constantly always amen thank you one of us the situations and protections and things that we need that you are always taking care of yes oh god become aware but we love you lord and we just appreciate you taking care of us yes thank you lord i know the people that we know that we care for we enjoy seeing you healing them and taking care of them too yes amen in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord god bless you could be seated if you'd like amen a couple of these prayer requests you know i have sometimes a little more detail on i just don't share as much unless i have the full um okay of the people that we mentioned i just know that there's some illness and i just want to remember them in prayer so praise the lord that's the most important thing anyway it's prayer god knows amen let's turn over well if you want to turn over you can i'm going to sing this song here um god on the mountain amen it's 698 you're at home or streaming you've got a book uh if you want to look at the book here we'll be on the screen of course psalm 698 god on the mountain praise the lord amen let's sing it to him today life is easy when you're up on the mountain and you've got peace of mind like you've never known but then things you're down in the valley but don't lose me child for you're never alone [Music] when things go wrong he makes them right and the god of the good times [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] he makes them is [Music] life is easy when you're up on the mountain [Music] but then things [Music]

saints praise the lord yes he is he's the god on the mountain he's god in the valley amen i know the song says when things go wrong he makes him right amen he's god in the bad times but when you serve the lord jesus the only bad thing is if we feel it is bad but it's not bad it's not bad it's not bad times that god has us go through those times to help us and to bless us and for some reason we may not ever understand it on this earth may not ever become a reality why god does certain things amen but it's for a reason amen and the valleys are just as good times as the mountains amen they don't feel like it they don't seem like it amen but it's god working his perfect plan in our lives and he will work everything out for our good because he promised to because we love him amen we love him and trust him amen praise the lord jesus sister norma has a song for us now amen if she wants to come amen god bless her thank you jesus amen bless her lord god bless you brother dennis the lord works on us our children the children of god you can't get away with anything amen he'll deal with it he sure hasn't dealt with me yes praise the lord [Music] amen it's my dissolution [Music] to live for him though [Music] it's my desire [Music] amen thank you jesus if you could sing were jesus brought me from to where i am today yes amen [Music] [Music] to amen hallelujah [Music] today yes maybe someone who may have failed to see the way you see i too once was low loss but jesus found me where amen and it's my desire to live for him hallelujah if you could see where jesus brought me from to where i am [Music] now you can [Music] is is [Music] to live for him amen amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] i just want to thank you all for praying for me um but i passed a couple days later i was able to apply and by the next monday i was officially a licensed life insurance station so thank you all for your prayers for the lord amen praise the lord i also want to thank the lord for touching my body um monday night i was feeling pretty bad and then by the time i laid down for bed i was just overcome with fever chills all that so i had the night chills for two days deeper for two days a sore throat hit um and it's all pretty bad for you because i've had papers and stuff before usually one night slowed out it's gone but this was persistent and i i've been making fun of the devil for picking on my nephew so i think it was a targeted attack because whatever i got from wherever i got it i've always been around someone mom and daddy the kids exact have at the friends no one else has got sick or got these symptoms so that i don't want to miss so i want to thank you for helping me touch me i was originally going to just play a song because my voice wasn't working but um i asked the lord if he would give me good enough to where i could see um and i was able to sing with the congregation so i'm going to try this one because it was on my heart while i was thinking that this week so i hope it's a blessing to you amen [Music] i thought number one would surely be me i thought i could be what i wanted to be i thought that i could build on life [Music] without you holding my hand [Music] i thought i amen [Music] but i can't [Music] without you holding me amen [Music] i can't even walk without you holding my hands again [Music] without you holding my head walk without you holding my hand [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen thank you lord thank you jesus hallelujah amen isn't that the truth saints praise the lord my mind how truthful that is can't even walk without him holding our hands praise the lord jesus amen let's stand if we could and then we're going to change all of the service now get into the scripture saw me reach for my phone sony got a text from sister theresa um and she sent the message she sent through said that she was just very exhausted and that they're supposed to be putting charlie in hospice care taking him to a hospice place don't know which one yet um that's just a lot of the devil i don't know why they're taking them to he's awake cognizant breathing on his own i don't understand just i don't know if they're just trying to kill people today i don't understand yes sometimes people going to hospice can get better yeah so he might be able to just do it on his own that might be a good thing it could be insurance too i know that's kind of the way it seemed like it was with julie's dad uh every time it got to a place that the insurance started running out that shipped him someplace else and and something else happened and shipped him over here and they put him in a hospice or assisted living or something and when the money run out then they shipped him someplace else so that could be it too yeah but my wife's right i've known a lot of people come out of hospice you know um but you know hospice uh it does a lot of good things uh but sometimes it's just it's just sad that our whole system seems to have just become about money right it really is it's just sad that it just seemed to have come without about money but but god's hands on brother charlie so um i just thank god god's with brother charlie and that's that's just the end of that for me i i haven't fretted about it i haven't actually fret about brother charlie in two or three weeks now honestly um i haven't been concerned over it i still pray for him i still keep him before the lord every day um but it hasn't i haven't just like the other day i mean i don't put it out but the other a couple days ago i got such a piece about priscilla i i priscilla just wasn't going to die i knew she wasn't but we prayed for her amen and keep her before the lord but it was just something that just came on my heart like i told you last week and all i can tell you i'm not telling you i'm prophesying i'm just telling you what the lord puts on my heart and that's all i can tell you is what the lord puts on my heart maybe it is prophecy i don't know i'm not a prophet to say to prophesy i just know what i feel the lord puts in my heart and the spirit that i feel and that's where i'm at so but we do continue to remember brother charlie in prayer and my wife maybe i believe she is exactly right sometimes it goes in a different environment and it's a a lot of times hospice is a lot nicer place it's not all chrome and styrofoam and whatever the hospitals are you know it's just a different environment so maybe maybe they'll let us go in and see him too i don't know i hope so um i hope so but we'll see anyway that's the message sister theresa uh sent to us so brother angel sent me a message and said yes better at home so i'm believing sister teresa and brother angel and i don't know if you sit with priscilla but we love you and sister sheila is going to be streaming so we love you miss you if sister matisse if you're there too amen god knows amen but we'll get to the word now amen turn to saint mark chapter 5 i thank god he's a miracle-working god yes amen praise the lord jesus saint mark chapter five we're going to read a couple of verses of scripture here before we let you be seated amen let's just read verse 34. saint mark chapter 5 verse 34. i often do that when i have a little lengthy reading i'll just read a little portion and let you be seated so um we'll just read verse 34 mark 5 34 let's pray though before lord jesus father again we approach your throne of grace boldly lord knowing that we're robbed in your righteousness not our own believing god that you hear and answer the cries of our heart we thank you so much for being present with us always lord we thank you for being here with us in this room god this place this church has been dedicated consecrated set aside for service to you for worshiping to praise you for those that are at home or where they may be listening watching god bless them each one as well father we're so thankful that you're with us that you never leave us or forsake us god we thank you lord for this day we thank you for each one that's here we thank you for your healing virtues we thank you for salvation we thank you from deliverance lord of demonic spirits and depressions of devils we thank you lord for always showing us god that you are present and that we can have the faith and belief that peace god to know that lord even as that song i sing in the bad times lord they're all good times because we're christians and we serve you and we love you lord and that makes every day a good day no matter where we're at or what's going on in life it's a good day because you're alive and you're the same yesterday today and forever you orchestrate our lives you lead us guide us direct us you show us what you have us to do every day father and lord everything that you allow god you allow for our good and we thank you for it lord bless each one lord bless this word lord bless your word is blessed but lord just speak through these lips the word should have us to hear trusting that word will not return void we rebuke every demonic spirit lord that may be here to try to help hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory the honor and the praise for all that is said and done here today where they may be watching and sending god do the same as well we give you the thanks to praise the glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen saint mark chapter 5 verse 34 very familiar story amen i will we'll read this and let you be seated and he said unto her daughter thy faith has made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague you could be seated if you'd like diane cavett sang a song last week kind of inspired this to my heart and after last week and i don't mind telling you last week i enjoyed the spirit of the lord with us so much and trust the obedience to the lord but it was hard on me uh that's just frank with you it's just hard on me uh bringing services and messages like that just just aren't easy i don't like doing that again i thought about the weeping prophets and what all he had to go through with the cursings that he continually gave to the to the country it had been really hard on him but uh things like that just uh it's truth you know what the scripture declares it but it just it's just hard to go into but they inspired me with that song they sang last week and and after that i felt like that unless the lord changed it to something else that i would just try to speak on maybe a little message of faith today and i titled the message today touching jesus which obviously goes of course along with the songs that i chose to sing today and of course this uh story in the bible that the lord gave us to to understand and to and to abide by but let's just read the whole story through again we know it by heart i'm sure we do we know the woman with the blood issue and what she went through what she was doing and her healing and all but let's read uh um let's see here let's just begin with verse 23. amen mark 5 23 and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years i found it kind of interesting that this man jarius who went to go heal his daughter she was 12 years old so it was it was unusual that jesus was going along the path to heal a girl that was 12 years old when along the journey she ill she he well he she received healing of uh of an issue that she had had for 12 years uh i don't know the spiritual significance to that if there is any i just found it unusual she had that issue for 12 years and the person that jesus was going to lay his hands on was 12 years old but at a certain woman had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many physicians and has been all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall behold and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague now listen how the progression of this story goes just told by mark of course here it's told a little different by luke but and a little different by matthew but um the premise of the story stays the same but follow the progression of the story see now and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched thee you know in other words jesus be quiet people will think you're mental people who think you've lost your mind lord you know there's people touching you and grabbing you and holding you and thronging you and you're setting who touched me everybody around here that's within arm's reach has touched you oh but he looked around he said but virtue has gone out of me see uh he didn't say it here mark didn't record that but luke did and he looked around to about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith has made thee whole go in peace be whole of thy plague while yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why trouble thou the master any further and as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe amen amen now we got this story here this uh woman with the blood issue and again as i wanted to point out as i pointed out to you to watch the progression of this story and see how it unfolded because it's very uh uplifting to us i believe to be able to have encouragement from in faith to see what this woman was able to receive from christ and the way she did now a lot of it of course is according to our faith uh jesus said that many times be it unto thee according to thy faith so it's it it's at the level of your faith and the levels of faith that each one of us have in most cases a lot of times is a little different now there'll be a time obviously when all of us bribe internationally will get to that level by hearing of the word of god to a rapturing faith the world will change our bodies and we'll go home to be with him amen but in living our lives and going through and depending on of course how much our lives are dedicated to the lord how much we read how much we pray uh coming to church and the ministering of things that build our faith and hearing of the word of god because remember that's what brings that faith that's what builds that faith that's what encourages and and exercises that faith up to a strong faith that you have the faith that you need to meet the circumstance when it comes to you it's like the song i sing friend uh this mckamey miss mckamey she is i'll call her sister mckamey she had that vision you know that at that one moment and you know it's true in life so many times at that one moment everything seems to be perfect everything's going great everything's wonderful and then all of a sudden bam the next second in life it seems like everything is turned upside down i mean it was strange of course it happened that way with me and my wife and uh when our first son was born you know you're happy you're gonna be new parents and you're gonna bring forth life into the world and then all of a sudden bam and you don't realize what's going on or why it's going on but you go from way up here to way down here in just moments it seems like uh i know with sister priscilla she was uh the friday night we were there with them at mariah's birthday party peter piper and and enjoying one another's company and having fellowship and enjoying a little bit of pizza and just enjoying life and the next thing i know brother angel's called me and says she's in the hospital i mean it's just like from here to here that quickly and it can happen that quickly now where is your faith going to me be to meet that when it does happen see that's just that's the place that we're looking for now to come to that place to all of a sudden build a ton of faith after it's happened is very difficult because faith gets built over a period of time brother branham referred to faith as muscles you know that yes a couple of places brother branham referred to faith as muscles you build your muscles you exercise your muscles well you don't go to the gym one day and spend two hours working out come out looking like arnold schwarzenegger it doesn't work that way the hulk lou ferrigno or who any of these bodybuilders you don't go in in a couple hours and come out all buffed up and looking like a giant doesn't work that way they hit the gym day after day after day hour after hour after hour taking care of their bodies eating and drinking the right stuff and see that's the same thing that happens with faith brother branham referred to that as muscle it takes time so when you when you're met with this as we call the valley uh it's not the time to go prayed up or try to get that faith that you need to meet that challenge your faith should already be there to meet that challenge so when the challenge comes you can face it head-on you can meet that challenge that's why we live our lives the way we do that's why we do the things we do that's why we take care of our bodies our spiritual bodies we eat and drink the right things amen we partake of the correct things so that we're prepared we listen to the word of god we let the word of god feed us we read the word of god see because the faith comes by hearing that word and that continues to build that faith and it comes to uh you know the the a person who has little bitty muscles or a person that has the giant muscles now we're talking about physical anymore we're talking about spiritual faith faith muscles amen have that faith muscle so when the enemy tries to come and he tries to hit your head on just poop and manifesting he's done right amen not physically of course the spirituals not this warfare is not of the flesh it's the spiritual warfare but you you're in that spiritual position when the devil comes up amen how many times we heard the story boo how many times you heard the story about old uh i just call him grandpa works i guess uh that when he had that dream the devil coming he's big muscles and built up and he's just gonna crush it down to nothing and all of a sudden he just he in his dream mustered up enough strength to just say boo and he noticed the devil got smaller boom the devil got smaller and he just kept getting smaller and smarter he kept getting bigger and bigger before the devil just poof he was gone amen it takes that kind of and but but it didn't happen just off of one thing or one time it takes time so it takes time for us to build ourselves to the place that we have the faith to meet that how many times you hear in a message where brother adam tells a congregation uh he that he brings a specific message and he tries to talk to them encourage them to the place that it helps increase their faith even just enough at that moment so they can receive what they're wanting by coming there right amen amen he says that many times he says i'm just here to try to help build your faith he talked to that little girl that remember that one time that girl come up and she said oh yes i got faith he said no you don't i mean i'm paraphrasing of course just go sit down and watch the prayer line a little bit it'll help build your faith and another one come up that'll come up no she just didn't get it yet another one come up no just didn't get it yet but when it was her time and after watching that and after seeing god on display and increasing her faith she got to the place to where she come up and she received what she needed amen praise the lord many times it brings us to that point of faith it's just a simple part of touching jesus now what was it of the faith of this woman that she had that she needed to get what she wanted her faith was to the point that she said in herself if i can just touch his garment if i can just touch the hem of his garment if i can just touch his clothes i don't even need to touch him if i can just touch his clothes that was where her faith was that's why she said that in herself different people say different things for different reasons oh if i could just have this oh if i could just touch this or whatever it is that's where their faith level is her faith level was to the place that she and herself said if i could just touch his clothes then i'll be well right that's where she was that's where god met her amen and that's what touched jesus that's what she didn't touch him physically she just touched his garment well with all the people around him how could he have known that there was one that touched him because strength left him the strength left him to go in and heal her now notice notice in the scripture when she touched him straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt her body was healed from that plague immediately she was healed praise god do you recognize that according to the writings here that she was probably she actually probably received healing before jesus even knew about it we always want to call jesus on the scene but you know this woman it would appear as though it was at least if nothing else it was immediate that she was healed before jesus could even turn around and say who touched me when he turned around and recognized the virtue had left him and turned around and said who touched me she was already healed amen she had already received her healing amen right amen oh thank you he just realized she was before she was healed before jesus even knew what was going on because she came up behind him the bible said i don't think this story accounts it but i think matthew and or uh yeah matthew and luke account she came up from behind him touched uh just touched his garment from behind praise the lord and everybody around was was touching him and throwing him but that one lady so what did she touch she didn't touch what she touched his garment because that was but it was where her faith level was it was her faith that touched him amen there's only one way to touch him today you must believe when you call on his name that's the only way to touch him today it's the same today as it was then only way to touch him he's not hearing a physical body anymore that we could see a tangible a body except of course his bride but jesus himself in a tangible body to touch or to touch his garment or to speak to or have him pray over us or something to that sort but our faith can reach out that's that's what we we touch him with amen no brother branham had no power other than what god gave him right and it wasn't his power to use it was god using it through him yes that's why the angel of the lord said get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray then nothing will stand before your prayer why because that's the love and the faith that you reach to be able to accomplish the scripture the scriptural precedent which we'll read a little bit later that's what the bible says sincerity love and sincerity brings faith get to people to believe faith which operates by love this sincerity which brings the result many people have different levels her level was right there and when she touched him it was by her faith not by her hand but that's where her level was now see if you had a if somebody there had had a different level of faith and jesus had been off in the corner somewhere or or been down the street or something and someone could say oh if i could just cast my eyes on him i would be healed then that would be their faith level to receive what they want they didn't even have to touch his clothes what's the faith level today we may not see him we may not feel him physically we may not uh uh be able to see a tangible body but our faith reaches him yes just as it does he doesn't even have to be here to see some people say well i gotta have him lay hands on me you know some people today oh with brother branham i've heard that oh brother branham we're still here well what about god right yes god didn't die with brother branham amen god didn't take away his gifts of the spirit when brother bradham passed the gifts of the spirit are still the same it just takes faith to operate it amen you just got to believe it but some are like oh if you would lay hands on me well that's where their faith is or if you just speak to me if you'll just give me a word and that's where some people's faith level is oh if i could just touch his garment that's where some are if i could just see him that's where theirs is where's ours where's our faith level right do we need to have somebody god in a corporal body here to touch you to lay a hand on you to pray over you to touch to look in his eye oh that would be wonderful i would like that too but our faith is what touches it am i amen our faith that's what touches god she was healed by her own faith jesus said see look here now he said daughter thy faith jesus didn't say i have healed you right jesus didn't say i make you well he said your faith your faith has made you whole go in peace it was her faith that did it jesus again jesus didn't even know what was going on he came up she came up from behind him and touched just his garment he didn't know what's going on she was healed immediately and jesus what happened who did that she came up and confessed thy faith has made you whole now people want to make other things out of it or turn it into something else but that's just how simple it really is a lot of times people's lives aren't to the place to receive that right amen the condemnation that they feel from their lives not lining up with the word that's the problem amen but god must be first god will be first yeah saint luke i got several scripture i want to read but let's go to saint luke chapter 7 now so keep your bibles handy i do have several scriptures i want to read i always give you time uh try to give you time to look them up but you can see i always to be a little more efficient i always put a tab where i'm going to a scripture i always do lie them down first second third fourth course of god changes it sometimes but that's that's what so i go to it fairly quickly so you can see the blue tabs i have i have several scriptures that i want to refer to today but don't intend to be uh too lengthy of course like last week but um but i want to try to go through this the best again st luke chapter seven now let's look at this other aspect of faith saint luke chapter 7 verse 44 and he turned to the woman and said and said unto simon seest thou this woman now we we know the story of course uh where she came in and she had the ointment and she cried and she dried her his feet she washed his feet with her tears and dried up with her hair and anointed and the the oil anointed jesus and and basically was a rebuke to simon simon was the one that had invited him but he didn't make him feel welcome this woman came in who was ill-reputed made him feel welcome who is the greater blessing but he turned to her and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into your house thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head though gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in had not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou diss not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is given the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven praise the lord thy sins are forgiven they said and then that said it meet with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgive his sins also so he heals and he saves and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace how was she saved by her faith her faith compelled her to do what she did to jesus her faith compelled her to come in and wash his feet and to anoint him and to kiss his feet and to make him feel welcomed and loved like she did how many times does jesus come into a church service and he's forgotten about right right or he's left out or he's not made welcome people sing and shout and scream and do all kind of things that but god doesn't inhabit just any worship saints he inhabits the worship of his people he inhabits the worship that come from your heart not just because you could scream shout play a piano sing like an angel whatever it is that doesn't draw god on the scene it's your faith that draws god on the scene it's your faith that brought jesus here today it's your faith that contacts him and touches him right now for whatever you have need of your home god will contact you touch your hospital hospice wherever you are you reach out that faith is what touches god nothing all the other foundries and stuff and and they're singing and shouting and praising and jesus is still sitting over in the corner with dirty feet unwelcome he was invited there oh you know brother graham said oh if i could have just been that courier if i could if i could have just been the courier that was assigned to go tell jesus that he was invited to go to simon's house for dinner if i could have just been that courier it had been a whole lot more than an invitation delivered he said i probably wouldn't even forgot to give the invitation amen praise the lord one of the courier when said here this is for you and took off he said oh my if i could have just been that fellow but you know he got there feet washed wasn't kissed wasn't welcome there's nothing about the welcome but she did all of that her faith it's what brought and jesus acknowledged so it's not just that faith that that healed the woman with the blood in you that faith is what saved this sin riddled woman this woman of ill repute this uh a ill-fated woman was healed though her sins were many was saved because of her own faith because she believed it she didn't just believe it she received it when she received it she acted upon it the others were sitting over there eating and saying oh i believe jesus is here but what did that amount to nothing they just kept eating their dinner leaving him dirty nasty stinking over there in the corner it didn't amount anything anything to them they just kept going on about their business oh i believe jesus is here and people do the exact same thing today have any church services around this country today where jesus tried to visit on the outside not welcome maybe he's even sitting in the corner jesus with dirty feet again just waiting for some kind of acceptance some kind of faith to reach out and offer a receptive uh reception of his word to receive his word is to receive him and the only way you can receive his word is to receive it by faith and that faith is what causes uh uh uh causes to move the hand of jesus is that faith thy faith thy faith has saved thee right jesus took a chance that took a time to even give that as an example as a lesson to simon and everybody sitting there i want simon i want you and all the rest to listen up here this is how you treated me i was an invited guest and this is how you treated me i'm not in her home she didn't invite me but i've been made more welcomed by her than i have all the lot of you and all you piety and your holiness and your righteous attitudes and all you would even have this woman in your home if she hadn't come in and sprung down at my feet you wouldn't have even let her enter the door but since she's been here this is what she's done and this is what she's done this is what she's done now she's been saved been forgiven because of her faith yes she acted on our faith people a lot of times they say i have faith and there's no action right there's no act if there's no action how is there faith with no action faith is faith is not a noun faith is a verb saints there's action with faith that faith moves now obviously in the english vernacular human uh faith can be a noun but it's not a noun it's a verb it's something you do is something you act on this woman was healed because of her action of faith this woman was saved because of her action of faith reach out and touch the lord thy faith saved by thy faith amen amen you got to understand faith's not even faith especially in this world of plenty that we have today faith not even faith unless all you're holding on to is christ the word it's not even faith right if you're relying on something else or some outside source or some other entity or some that's not faith faith is the pure unadulterated belief in god in his work and what he said he would do in his word yes believing that word amen he promised to bear our burdens didn't he he promised to deliver us from all evil he promised he would never leave us or forsake us he promised that by his stripes we are healed he promised to deliver us from oppression and depression he promised all these all these gifts all these blessings that god he's promised every one of them to us he's promised to be our birthright we was talking to sister vicky friday and she she admit she'd give give the trial to the lord and then take it back and take it give it to the lord and take it back you know i've said it like this many times people come to an altar and they'll they'll they'll they'll pour their heart out to the lord and they'll give that over to the lord and you know that weight is a sin you know that sin is awake excuse me if people carry around that burden is a weight that burden is something that that you carry around with you amen a lot of people walk hunched over because of that but uh it's a weight it weighs you down right and and people come and they'll try to throw that weight off but then when they get done praying they go they go home or something and they just throw that weight back on them again he said well how did they throw it back on they threw it back on by trying to do the whole thing they just gave to god by themselves they try to take control over it they try to circumvent the will of the lord look friends sometimes the will of the lord is the hard way in fact a lot of times the will of the lord is the hard way but we don't want to take the hard way i've had people pray oh pray for my children i said well what about your children what's going on and they'll tell me i said well i've got to be honest with you i'm not going to pray blessings on your child i'm going to pray that god does whatever he has to do to get your child where they need to be with the lord amen if that's hospital if that's imprisonment if that's homeless eating out of gutters whatever god's got to do to get your whole don't don't pray like that well then don't ask me to pray because i'm not going to pray for the blessings of god of your child when all it's going to do is make them a worse reprobate than they are now right i that sounds hard saints but it's the truth yes amen how many of us coming to the lord came on a flowery bed of ease this birth is a hard birth it's a hard life but god blesses us in it amen praise the lord god blesses us in it but the blessings the lessons of god so many times they're hard it's a hard way it's a hard road that we uh that we chose to take and i tell and that that's just the way it is don't ask me to pray for them if you don't want me to pray for god's will and for whatever needs to be done to get them to the lord i said isn't the end result of your child being saved what you really want am i giving somebody everything has never helped a single person right never never will what is it get uh uh get him a fish and they got a meal teach them how to fish and they got a meal for life nobody's ever benefited from being given everything their whole life nobody right that's why you see the tradition that kind of goes where the rich people the kids are always spoiled brats yes because they get given everything all the time you can't just give to them their lives sometimes have got to go into the doldrums of of of life the hardness of life to get them up where they need to be in the lord amen and that that's just and isn't that not what you really want don't you want your children say won't you want your family safe don't you want your family with the lord serving god don't you want to see them on the other side spend eternity together then don't you want to happen whatever needs to happen to them to get them to that point yes amen and i get that as a story friend but i've actually literally had people do that to me well then don't pray don't worry i won't amen unless god puts them on my heart of course if the lord puts somebody in my heart i'm going to pray for them i don't care what anybody else says but that's just the fact i don't i don't want them to just be i want their lives with the lord i want to born again filled with the spirit i want to see them in heaven i want to spend eternity with him and sometimes most of the time not all the time it comes the hard way it's not it's not the easy way holding on to christ that holding on to something you can't see it is is not an easy thing humanity and our human are human senses ct's fill smell here and imagination constant reason affection those things that are in our body our spirit they're not meant to trust or rely on things that you can't see our bodies aren't aren't built to trust in something or have faith confidence in something you can't tangibly hold or you can't see visibly or you can't feel we're not our human bodies aren't built that way amen they're not built for that so when you overcome this flesh to believe and have a faith in something or someone that you cannot see that you cannot touch that you cannot hold that you cannot taste it's hard to do it grace against every bit of our human emotion that there is our human being it goes against everything that we're that we learn as human beings yes we learn everything of what you can see or what you can hear or what you can taste or feel that's how we learn everything so then when you get older and become a christian and and you and you have to overcome this flesh with a faith that believes in something you can't see that's hard to do that's why brother branham would tell the girls sit there and you can see god manifesting and people being healed and the things going on and that'll help build your faith because see then it's something you can see but but to have a faith a a complete reliance of our lives of a faith in something you can't even see that that goes against every bit of our our humanity that's why we have to overcome the flesh and get past the flesh that's the only that faith is the only thing that can bring us beyond our humanity so that we can get to holding on to christ the word and him alone amen him only other people that were there when he was in a corporal body they could see him they could touch him they could hear him but how many people actually truly believed to receiving christ's message how many disciples did he have 12 one was the devil how many people around there believed it there were way more people that believed the message coming out of peter and paul and the philip the disciples than there was when jesus was here just think about that how many people how many people i mean there's probably now look around there's only one person in this room i know that knew brother branham brother pat how many people of that day would you imagine actually believed or received what that messenger was preaching that message that word that came forth a lot of them i believe were blinded just because of the man they were blinded of christ because of the man and all the things that he was doing all the things that was happening through him he wasn't doing them god was doing him through him but people would get so confused about that and then look at brother branham and see brother batman to the point that 50 years later people oh just brother branham were here where is your faith how many people actually then believe brother green said this several times how many church how many message churches there were in tucson when brother green left the scene or when brother brown left the scene two he said that he knew of tucson tabernacle and mesa church i think those are the two brother green mentioned i don't know i was i was only born 10 days before brother brown passed so i don't know that's what brother green's if i remember right brother green said message church roy carpenter and tucson tavern on two one brother passed away how many are there now 100 200 there's there's a couple dozen or more just in phoenix there used to be 14 15 here in tucson i don't know how many there are now home churches and people that just meet together how many of flagstaff show low pine top prescott there's churches all over the place it wasn't like that when brother branham was here but why has the message done by faith to bring multitudes around the world to hear this message and believe it how many are there going to be live and remain i don't know how many since brother branham's passing have there gone this passed on that died in christ that believed this message lived this truth and had faith in it amen what a lot when jesus was here but look how that happened three three thousand souls were just added at one message 15 minute message at the day of pentecost in the upper room that was 3 000 souls added that day there weren't that many when jesus when jesus is standing in the flesh it just goes to show saints my whole point is it's faith in christ the word not not in a person not an intangible individual this work is not a work of humanity it's a work of the spirit and the spirit of god that's when each every one of us says that by the moving of the faith that's in your life is what produces the results that's what brings the results it's the faith that does it let my faith move the hand of god praise the lord i think so many times we get confused too the will of well we want the will of god yes we do and i don't mean to confuse that or conflate that with with faith i don't i don't mean that people i want the will of god well you know i believe that god will help you to understand and know what the will of god is especially if it's something that's dear and close to you i told you the story about my sister several times i prayed for my sister to be healed i prayed for her healing i believed for her healing i trusted god for her healing i i i prayed and believed to the point that i knew my sister was going to be well but then that one night coming across interstate 40 from flag to show low the lord told me to stop praying for her and i found out why the lord told me why that a unto me according to your will lord i quit praying for her to be healed and god took her home amen is that simple yeah will you know the will of the lord god will show it to you you're a child of god saint god loves you god god's not just he's not some sinister god over the corner just saying oh just just wait for that person to really have faith and i'll strike them down god's not he's not that kind of god he's a loving merciful kind god he loves you you're his children and and he wants you to to be a part of that he wants you to know amen brother brown god tried to warn the shakira family about sister florence and and her going on but they didn't want it they didn't want to have anything to do with that god god used the prophet to tell him it's her time to go i'm going to take her home and friend it probably everybody was there and fought about against brother brown and with us probably gone now too we're all going to come to that place eventually if the lord doesn't rapture us home we're all going to come to that place so when is it going to be by what means is it going to be that's god's choice whatever god chooses to do but i'm going to hold on to faith if god says something different then that's okay amen but according to his word by your faith you hold on to it you believe that i remember my brother was he had a stroke and was supposed to die just right then they didn't expect him to live 12 hours i went to prayer to god i said god don't you take my brother until he's ready to go i said i my brother is not going to go to hell i'm believing in faith lord you're going to do with him right now whatever you have to do don't take him before he's ready my brother lived another week before the lord took him home and i had peace in my heart amen and it didn't change anything it didn't make anything any different it's just knowing who you are yes it's just standing on your own his word is standing on his promise with the faith that he gave you to use belongs to me it's my possession amen you don't own a house and property and somebody comes and trespasses and and does whatever they want to to your property and you're like well you need to get off my property unless unless you know fred down the street gave you permission then you can stay well fred's got nothing to do with your property it's your property yes unless bob down the street or something unless he said it's okay uh uh well or unless somebody you just met in jail or something if it's so it's okay then you can stay it doesn't work that way it's my property it belongs to me i say who comes on there and doesn't i say what happens on their what doesn't not them not the devil me the devil doesn't say what happens in my life the devil doesn't dictate what happens in my family i do right it's my property it's my faith it's what i believe hold on to that salvation let's go to another scripture i might have to go through them rather quick now saint uh not saint james james chapter five faith saints is so much more than just saying i believe right faith is so much more than just even quoting hebrews is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen it's so much more than just that faith is the very foundation of our spiritual welfare the statue of a perfect man doesn't exist without faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness love brotherly kindness none of that exists in your life without faith people try to they try to jump in a church and just get right up there with virtue or or knowledge or something because most of the time it's knowledge everybody wants to gain knowledge in this message why does everybody want to have a bunch of knowledge in the message but they've skipped faith how can you have knowledge without the faith to believe it that it's god's word you can have head knowledge but i'm talking about the actual godly knowledge that god gives you guys you can't even get it without the faith that's got to be the foundation so everything starts with faith everything every facet of your life even the things you can see touch phil smell here every bit of us by faith now it's a different type of faith like walking in this building and flipping on the switch and the lights come on i believe when i flip the switch the lights are gonna come on and they did amen sometimes i flip the switch though and one doesn't come on or it comes on for a second goes out because the bulb goes out or something you know but it's just a different kind of faith james chapter five let's read this james 5 13 is any among you afflicted let him pray amen any afflicted any afflicted pray let him pray is he married let him sing songs is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord well in the name of jesus christ i believe and pray that by faith that the holy spirit is going to pour out on my brother the holy spirit is going to pour out on my sister oh you say well what is that that's the oil the holy ghost is the oil that you pour out on that person it might not be a literal bot a bottle that you put on them or something but it's your faith that sends god to that person and pours out the holy ghost on them that's the holy ghost is where the healing virtue comes from you do that by faith amen let him call for the oldest of the church what have we done let them pray over him we pray anointing him with them with oil in the name of the lord they're anointed in the name of jesus by his stripes they are healed simple amen amen they could come here somebody's here and want to lay hands on them and and anoint them with oil that's fine too amen but so many times you hear people and about the only equation they put to this uh is a literal interpretation well they've got to be standing here in a church you've got to come up to that person and put your hand on that person and put oil on them that's not the only interpretation of the scripture you can pray for that person and you can send the holy ghost to their bed or where they're lying and have that oil poured out all over them in the form of the holy ghost because that's where healing is anyway healing's not the bottle of olive oil healing's in your faith amen and the prayer of faith shall save the sick heal the sick save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he had committed sin they shall be forgiven him now we've got james giving us an accumulation of the two stories we just read you got physical healing and you got spiritual salvation both at the hands of the believer by faith isn't that right prayer of the faith shall save the sick heal the sick and the lord will raise him up and if he's committed sin they shall be forgiven him praise the lord healing salvation where does it belong in your faith salvation belongs in my faith absolutely if it doesn't then why did jesus tell her thy faith has saved you why does it say the prayer of faith shall save the sick and forgive them of their sins where does salvation lie in your faith yes amen we say well i'm saying what about your children what about your family what about your loved ones you believe for them too yes same faith is it not brother ram said same faith that you believed your saved is the same faith you used for them why because it's the scripture salvation comes by faith yes your faith your faith in this unfailing word brought salvation to your life it'll do the same for them amen your faith yes your faith why because it'll bring them to that place you say well i'm not saving them i don't say that but your faith could bring them to the point that their faith gets to that place to receive it as well amen thy faith has saved thee sin shall be forgiven them confess your faults one to another well that's a long lost thing isn't it now i want you to notice something here real quick it doesn't say confess your sin this is not a catholicism find a boost somewhere uh holy father what sins have you committed what sins will go to hail mary's and penances and whatever no no it's not that it's not that i stand there and absolve anybody of anything and say do a bunch of penance and you're okay no it doesn't work that way if you could but it does say confess your faults it does say confess brother sister i have a i i have a fault here or i have a weakness or i have a spirit that's trying to get a hold of me would you pray for me amen no then then we run into the i'll tell you something if you don't tell anybody that's why people quit confessing to one another amen loose lips sing chips that's why so many people quit following this scripture and saying brother and it's not saying i have fallen into this sin it's not saying that i have committed this sin it just says there's just a devil after me i want you to pray for me just like just like the devil gets after you for a sickness the devil's trying to get on me with the sickness that's confessing and you have people pray for you it's the same thing well if the devil's trying to get on you for a sickness couldn't he get onto you for some other weakness that you may have and trust me satan has had his minions evaluating you since the moment you were born right and finding every spot every little weak place he can to try to get into your life he knows them very well and he'll do everything he can to exploit that weak spot right well there's nothing wrong with coming saying brother even if it's just to a someone you have a lot of confidence in or the past or myself whatever my wife or your friend or brother or sister whatever it is you're just saying that the devil's just trying to torment me torment with me with this would you pray for me i i i have a i have a weakness of alcohol would you would you pray for me i have a weakness with lust would you pray for me i have i had i have a weaknesses that smoke demon i gave up cigarettes 20 years ago but that smoke demon when i just get it just comes on me would you pray that's just confessing a fault that's just confessing something that you say you want god to help you with and you want other people to join in prayer together with you to overcome that to get past that amen that's the way i see it confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now that effectual effectual means powerful and producing it's a powerfully producing prayer that aids somebody it's also to aid one to bring assistance to someone but your effectual prayer should be a powerful prayer powerful doesn't mean yelling and screaming power doesn't mean pulling or pouring a bottle of oil over somebody that's not powerful or jackal i think it was jack cole anyway used to come up and punch people in the stomach devil come out of her i think that's a powerful prayer that's not powerful power the power of a prayer comes from your faith amen it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble that's what a powerful prayer is you stand your ground and know who you are that powerful prayer produces something it brings results the effectual effectual just means it's hot burning passionate uh desirous you you you have a desire behind your prayer you're zealous about your prayer you're passionate about your prayer your passionate powerful prayer will bring results in one another's lives i believe a church a church that prays like that for one another not even necessarily we said we'll just forget to confess your fault but we're just praying for one another in that venue just pray for one another like this scripture says he sexually fervently passionately powerfully praying with your faith honored before the throne of god will would be a church the devil can't do nothing with right it'll be a congregation satan will come in but he won't have he won't be able to do anything to anybody he won't have a chance yeah amen because they're praying one for another right elias was a man subject to light passions as we are and prayed earnestly that it might not rain and reign not on the earth for the space of three years and six months and he prayed again the heaven gave rain the earth brought forth forth her fruit brethren if any of you do heir from the truth uh and one convert him let him know that he which covert the center from error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins praise the lord even a man like elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and that's another that's another curse to our faith let me read first john now uh for ten more minutes five more minutes i'll do it as quickly as possible there's there's a there's a few things that the lord gave me to understand what is the hindrances to our faith what is our faith based on see because our faith is has got to be based on something because we're still human beings we're human beings reaching into a dimension that we've never seen or felt or we know it's there but we only know it because of faith we only know it because of god in his word but it reaches into a different place to get a hold of it because it's not here understand and and that faith has got to come to that place that each facet of that and there's more than this i just got five five here of things that will hinder our faith are things that we need to accomplish and do in life uh i had this one listed differently but it goes along with elijah here first john uh first john chapter 3 verse 19 i'm just going to read and hereby we know that we are of the truth and assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things so if our heart is condemned why would our heart be condemned because we're not living right right because we're not doing what we're supposed to do which brings us to number five that i was going to say obedience amen faith operates by your obedience if you're disobedient you won't have the faith to be able to to do what you want meet the challenge understand if you're if you're disobedient and you know and you're cognizant of the fact that you're living a life or doing things or something that you're not supposed to be doing in your life it's going to burden your heart and your heart will be condemned by that thing and trust me satan will make sure he lets you know how condemned you are and your heart will be condemned and you won't be able to get to the faith that you need to have to produce the results it won't work right obedience i i took uh uh luke 5 1-9 for that but i won't read that but that obedience is a part of our faith a lack of obedience will hinder our faith pure write it brother graham say full obedience to the word of god entitle you to the token amen now people say that they try to put you in their little box with that well you got to do it the way i see it or you don't have the holy ghost no no no full obedience is obeying what god's word commanded us in getting the holy ghost it's not seven virtues as some people would say it's not fulfilling every one of the statue of a perfect man in fact i don't think you can establish or accomplish the statutes of a perfect man unless you have the holy ghost right that's my contention about it but you understand without obedience your heart's condemned and and if you have faith and you're living the life you know you're supposed to there's no hindrances then your heart doesn't continue god is greater than our heart why is john saying that he's saying that because he's saying if there's something condemning you if there's something on your heart god is greater than your heart god is greater than that condemnation god is greater than that impediment get rid of it repent of it eradicate it from your life confess your fault one to another that we pray for one another now i i i'm talking about some rough stuff saints but this is just the way the scripture works and we're willing to do it or we're not right if we're not willing to do it it's not going to bring the results right that's just the fact you do it the way the bible says it will work if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards god then we have faith towards god if there's nothing if there's no condemnation if there's nothing lying in the way if the obedience in your life lines up with the word then you don't have to worry about it amen because you're standing on god's word god's promise you have to know the word for yourself some people see certain things certain ways some people see them the other way but it's got to come down to the full obedience in the word that entitles you to the token not a perfect life human life but the three-step process repent be baptized name the lord jesus christ for mission sin you shall receive the holy ghost those three steps must be obeyed in god's word before you can get the holy ghost that's the full obedience it entitles you to that token you understand there's there's if you're going into a room or you're going up some stairs or you're going into a store usually you've got something you're going to accomplish there's a purpose you're coming into that room for you came through that door today because you come in to have church for us to be here together and have church that's the purpose that you desire to have accomplished when you came through that door amen well when that was met that was it that was your obedience it didn't your obedience entitled you to be here today when you clicked on a button and you started streaming your obedience entitled you to that well when it's done that's it you understand some people say full obese well that means you got to be perfect no it doesn't it just means you obey the scripture that it gets you to the place of receiving the holy ghost that's all that means it brings you to the holy spirit praise the lord once you get the holy spirit then then your whole nature changes and everything about life changes you see we can't have any condemnation to have confidence and faith our heart can't condemn us right and if we're not obedient to the word there's going to be condemnation that faith's not going to be the way it's supposed to be galatians now i've said this scripture many times i think i've been having my book but a glacier galatians now 5 6 says for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor circumcision but faith which worketh by love so you can say i got all the faith in the world yeah but if you hate your brother how is that faith going to work faith come by here and yes it did i got faith i got big muscle faith but you don't have any love won't work it's like the angel lord told brother branham be sins get the people to believe faith be sincere when you pray operates by love and then people will be healed nothing will stand before your prayer faith operates by love if you don't actually have the love the prayer the faith is not going to be operated like it should or even at all it's operating works by love amen that love godly love not just a filial love god's love there's a there's got to also be forgiveness faith works by forgiveness if you're unwilling to forgive someone that will condemn you that will condemn your heart is un holding back forgiveness is disobedience to god's word people think they have the right to hold something against somebody else when you absolutely do not if you have the right to hold something against somebody else i don't care who they are or what they've done to you if you have the right to hold something against somebody else that gives jesus christ the right to hold something against you right do you want that no i don't god help me i don't want to hold anything against anybody because i don't want anything held against me and if god's god enough to forgive us enough to forgive them then i can forgive them too right yes and even if he doesn't forgive them i forgive them anyway you know forgiveness is for you anyway it's not for them right well if i forgive them that gives a leg up on me no it doesn't you forgive me gives you a leg up on them it's like the bible said you're pouring coals of fire on their head amen that forgiveness gives you the upper ground it helps you to be able to have your faith because now there's no impediment there's nothing in the way there's nothing condemning you there's nothing stopping it praise the lord confidence and forgiveness and one more humility those are the five that i've got here humility you've got to be humble before the lord for that faith to operate i'll read it real quick here romans 12 3. for i say the through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think listen to scripture now not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according to god according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith humility not to think about what he really is and the truth of it is i'm nothing so how could i think more than what it i'm nothing more than a child of god amen that that's who i am that's what i am but beyond that i'm nothing amen praise the lord that helps bring that faith that's how that faith will operate humility love forgiveness obedience confidence amen and and in god's word those five that the lord showed me in the scripture and then again there are so many more saints but those are the things the lord gave me one more scripture as i close here hebrews chapter 4. hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and as and of the joint joints and moral and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus is the son of god let us hold fast our profession professions are part of that faith too yes amen confession and profession we uh for we have not a high priest listen to this double negative now and turn it into the positive for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so what he's saying is we do have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen amen touched by the feeling of our infirmities what was our title touching jesus touched by the feeling of our infirmities your infirmity brings to faith your infirmity brings prayer and your infirmity will bring the confidence i believe god he's healed me before he'll heal me again amen he saved me he can save them he's still the same yesterday today wherever he hasn't changed he's here right now we might not touch him he might not be tangible to us we might not can see him but you know how you can feel him you can feel him not not like a touch like this but you can feel him amen in your spirit that is that god churning in your soul amen letting you know i'm here i'm present i'm with you yes praise the lord god didn't show up with the three hebrew children until they were actually in the fire amen we don't know if he will or not but we know he's able yes well he certainly did he certainly was and he certainly did they were even thrown in the fire and there he was like what is what's well there's four one there's a fourth one in there just walking around who is he he looks like the son of god praise the lord amen come out their bonds were they were loose and they didn't have a smell of fire smoke praise god god is good isn't he amen amen we've been in our own furnaces of fire from time to time and then some may feel like you are now right but god many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivered him out of them of all rights praise the lord all of them oh it is sometimes that all release comes at our leaving this world amen the release of that all sometimes means that we go home to be with him but it's still released yes praise the lord jesus let's stand if we could amen praise the lord jesus amen i want to see this one more song here i wasn't going to i was just going to sing of course but when i look at it i just feel like the lord inspired me for this yesterday i want to see this you could be seated

it together you know this song do you know what we'll start with the verse uh it's actually in the song book too if you're at home you have a songbook uh i forget what number it is uh 603. if your
