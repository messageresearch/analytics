[19:52] um but if you could just send in some uh
[19:55] brother bennett or to myself
[19:56] before service or if you want to write
[19:58] them down but i'll give an opportunity
[20:00] at this time if anyone has a testimony
[20:02] yes
[20:03] i actually have three so
[20:06] we heard this week about the lawsuit and
[20:10] um the her lawyer
[20:13] called our lawyer and said that
[20:18] she was going to get financed in that
[20:20] and then he received an email from the
[20:21] banker
[20:22] that he the word he used was wishy-washy
[20:26] and i just don't think that she's going
[20:27] to get financed so
[20:29] the lord is i'm just continuing to thank
[20:31] him and that we'll get our money back
[20:33] for
[20:34] what we gave the other one is that my
[20:38] dad went to get
[20:39] um his hearing checked and he was 48
[20:43] hearing in one ear and 60 something in
[20:45] the other and i was praying really hard
[20:48] and he was financed for his hearing
[20:50] needs and so
[20:51] i just thank the lord for that and then
[20:54] i am stepping out in faith because i was
[20:56] told that i need to have a root canal
[20:58] and
[20:58] i am claiming it that i do not have to
[21:01] have it like
[21:02] sister sonia and her foot so she didn't
[21:04] have to have foot surgery and i don't
[21:06] have to worry
[21:06] about so thank the lord for that yes
[21:10] praise the lord anyone else
[21:13] thank you lord yes um
[21:16] my wife was at that age she is able to
[21:20] apply for medicare
[21:21] and everything with the pandemic got to
[21:23] do online or go on the phone
[21:25] and she finally got it done and
[21:29] you know the card you can't even apply
[21:30] for any medicare insurance unless you
[21:32] have the card
[21:33] so they finally sent her the card and
[21:35] then she lost it
[21:38] so we prayed and i said it was such a
[21:40] hassle to get the card
[21:42] so i said let's go to the recycle bin so
[21:44] we
[21:46] went through the recycle bin i gave up
[21:49] she says then we look a little bit
[21:50] further and then she pulls it out
[21:56] oh
[21:59] amen yes this morning i
[22:02] when mother's day comes around because i
[22:04] had such a painful
[22:07] time starting many years ago even before
[22:10] i left
[22:11] my home in washington that i wondered if
[22:14] my children were going to call me
[22:15] um for mother's day and if they were
[22:17] going to text me or anything because i
[22:19] i'm always the one that has to initiate
[22:21] it you know to remind
[22:22] them here and i wish them a happy
[22:25] mother's day they have families now
[22:28] and so this morning i was deeply safe i
[22:31] don't dream anymore
[22:33] um um i i started to just
[22:37] just recently a little here and there i
[22:39] realized
[22:40] but um it had been my prayer many years
[22:43] when i came here i didn't have time to
[22:44] sleep i just had to sleep
[22:46] and so for me to have this dream this
[22:49] morning
[22:50] was of god i i heard
[22:54] sounds behind the door and i've dreamt
[22:57] that i was in bed
[22:58] and it was sounds that like from my
[23:02] childhood when we were
[23:03] young and we um were planning something
[23:07] from my mother and i heard whispering
[23:09] behind the doors are supposed to be a
[23:10] big secret
[23:11] and and there was excitement and then
[23:14] also the door opens and then comes my
[23:16] darla and she sits on the bed
[23:19] at the head of the bed and just release
[23:22] and so i i kind of rubbed my eyes
[23:26] and just kind of trying to come too and
[23:29] i saw these numbers flash six
[23:31] seven six and they go back six seven i
[23:34] finally rubbed my eyes and i finally got
[23:36] up in real life i looked at the clock
[23:38] and it was
[23:39] 701 or 702 and so i text her and i told
[23:44] her my dream she says i was thinking
[23:46] about you this morning
[23:47] because i was cleaning and everything
[23:50] doing some
[23:50] you know chores earlier in the morning
[23:52] and she said i was thinking of you but i
[23:54] didn't want to text you too
[23:55] early so i know all the rest of them is
[23:59] behind that door
[24:00] and sure enough the next one came along
[24:03] about two hours later and text me so
[24:06] about an hour and a half later so
[24:08] i am so blessed this morning thank you
[24:10] god has
[24:11] blessed me and let me know that the

[42:29] every day amen i'm so looking forward to
[42:32] that time
[42:33] amen i'm so thankful that uh and
[42:36] appreciative mike is saying that song i
[42:38] can't even begin to tell you i or count
[42:41] how many times my mom and my sister sang
[42:43] that song
[42:44] from the time i can remember probably
[42:47] not much older than joel i was
[42:49] i remember hearing them sing that song
[42:51] amen they're singing it together today
[42:54] and enjoying their time together and
[42:57] i told you all and uh here probably a
[43:00] year or so ago
[43:02] when my mom was going that night i told
[43:04] her i said don't y'all have too great of
[43:05] a party now
[43:06] without me i'll be there pretty soon so
[43:09] enjoy your time together and
[43:11] he then come together again the family
[43:13] reunion but
[43:15] they got one left and i'm i'm ready to
[43:17] go amen i
[43:18] can't remember a time friend
[43:21] that people live in such fear and
[43:25] and i used to think it was just pure out
[43:28] fear and to a level it is
[43:30] but i've just never seen a generation so
[43:33] afraid to die
[43:35] don't get me wrong we're all human we
[43:37] want to live
[43:39] and i appreciate god's goodness and the
[43:41] life that he gives every single day
[43:42] because we're not promised tomorrow
[43:45] but to see people that are so scared to
[43:47] die
[43:48] it makes you realize what a godless
[43:50] society we've become
[43:53] used to didn't be that way friend you
[43:55] know to die was to gain
[43:57] of course that's the scripture people
[43:59] don't know that today
[44:01] people are scared they're afraid i saw a
[44:05] video this week of a lady
[44:06] walking around the supermarket in a
[44:09] bubble
[44:10] she actually created a
[44:13] field around her of pvc and plastic
[44:17] all the way around her and she's still
[44:19] wearing a mask
[44:21] in the middle surrounded by all this
[44:23] plastic and she's going and pushing her
[44:24] little cart in the shop in the
[44:26] shopping center in the grocery store and
[44:28] she's got a mask on she's surrounded i
[44:30] think people are just scared
[44:31] right they've gotten so afraid
[44:35] that that they're just besides
[44:37] themselves now
[44:39] and i understand the precaution i
[44:42] understand wanting to preserve life and
[44:44] the loss of one is
[44:45] is horrible but you know
[44:49] what what greater love is there
[44:53] that that uh that a person laid down
[44:55] their life for their brother
[44:57] but people are so scared today they
[44:59] wouldn't even think to do something like
[45:00] that
[45:01] uh it just it just makes me understand
[45:04] it seems like that that this has just
[45:06] become such a godless society
[45:09] people are just scared of that right
[45:11] they don't know what's going on they
[45:12] don't know where they're gonna go
[45:13] they don't know where they're gonna know
[45:15] they don't know what death entails
[45:18] so they're they're just they're afraid
[45:19] they're scared
[45:21] and they know and and it's sad it's sad
[45:25] that way
[45:26] but i thank god that he's made a
[45:27] provision for us to understand
[45:29] that we've had a prophet that's gone
[45:30] beyond the curtain of time and realize
[45:32] it's just changing of our dwelling place
[45:34] yes amen
[45:35] just from here to there you know to be
[45:38] absent from the body is to be present
[45:40] with the lord that's the scripture so
[45:42] we just stand upon god the promise of
[45:44] god's word and
[45:45] thank him for his blessings and his
[45:47] grace to us so amen happy mother's day
[45:50] to all the mothers happy mother's day to
[45:52] all the potential mothers
[45:53] we kind of at this church turn mother's
[45:56] day into a happy sister's day not to
[45:58] belittle
[45:59] motherhood because in no way would we do
[46:01] that right because it's quite a
[46:03] honor to be a mother but you know we
[46:05] like to honor all of our sisters we like
[46:07] to honor
[46:08] sister sheila said they have four
[46:10] generations her
[46:11] and then her daughter julie and then her
[46:13] daughter shariah and they're all three
[46:15] mothers and
[46:16] little alice is not a mother yet but
[46:17] she's a potential mother
[46:19] and time with terry and there's a very
[46:21] good chance that she'll be a mother one
[46:23] day
[46:23] right you just that's just that's just
[46:25] where we stand
[46:27] and that's where we hold it and that's
[46:29] how that's what regard we hold it in so
[46:31] happy mother's day to you happy mother's
[46:33] day to those who may be streaming

[46:37] bless you
[46:38] there's nothing greater in the world and
[46:40] as most of you know
[46:41] i usually try to take a little thought
[46:43] on mother's day so that's what we're
[46:45] going to try to do today
[46:47] and just trust it be a blessing to you
[46:49] so let's just stand to our feet if we

[49:27] is according to your word the medicine
[49:31] or science of this world wouldn't want

[49:57] and savior jesus christ we pray
[50:00] amen amen amen saint matthew chapter 15
[50:03] verse 21
[50:05] uh let's begin reading here
[50:08] then jesus went thence and departed into
[50:11] the coast of tyre and sidon the old
[50:13] woman of canaan came out of the same
[50:15] coast and cried unto him saying lord
[50:17] are saying have mercy on me o lord
[50:20] thou son of david my daughter is
[50:23] grievously vexed with the devil
[50:25] but he answered her not a word his
[50:27] disciples came and besought him saying
[50:29] send her away for she crieth after us
[50:32] but he answered and said i am not sent
[50:35] but to the lost sheep of the house of
[50:36] israel
[50:38] then came she and worshipped him saying
[50:40] lord
[50:41] help me but he answered and said
[50:45] it is not me to take the children's
[50:47] bread and to cast it to the dogs
[50:49] she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of
[50:52] the crumbs which fall from their
[50:54] master's table
[50:56] then jesus answered and said unto her
[50:58] old woman
[50:59] great is thy faith be it unto thee even
[51:02] as thou wilt and her daughter was made
[51:04] whole from that very hour
[51:06] i mean you could be seated if you like
[51:09] how we could probably just uh take that
[51:12] for a moment and
[51:13] and fold our bibles and go home
[51:17] uh i i believe the story there kind of
[51:19] speaks for itself doesn't it right
[51:21] but there's a few things that i want to
[51:23] mention today that the lord had put on
[51:24] my heart and as i was thinking about
[51:26] mother's day and
[51:27] a couple of weeks ago and it came on my
[51:29] heart and it was sort of fresh in my
[51:30] mind again i guess because
[51:32] we had our prayer meeting a couple of
[51:35] weeks ago on a wednesday and
[51:36] in that prayer meeting this woman came
[51:38] up and her story and her story of faith
[51:41] because our study was on faith and the
[51:43] study
[51:44] that we had kind of i guess brought it
[51:46] back to my remembrance that wasn't what
[51:48] did it but as i was praying
[51:50] the lord put this woman on my heart in
[51:52] this story and then when i started
[51:54] dwelling on it and looking at i thought
[51:56] how powerful
[51:57] it really was and and what an
[51:59] inspiration it should be to all of us
[52:01] not just the fact of the mother although
[52:04] uh
[52:04] i would believe and say that uh the
[52:07] prayers of a
[52:08] the the the love and prayers of a real
[52:11] godly mother prevail before god as much
[52:14] or more than anything
[52:16] amen because you can read the bible yeah
[52:18] you can see through the scriptures how
[52:20] that god
[52:21] has honored the prayers of mothers to
[52:23] the point that
[52:24] people have been blessed and healed and
[52:26] children and and this
[52:27] is just one example of it but this is a
[52:30] tremendous example because think of this
[52:32] for a moment
[52:33] this woman who really had no claims to
[52:35] jesus
[52:36] i mean he really reiterates that to her
[52:38] and says i'm not sent to this woman
[52:41] i'm not sent i'm not here for her i'm
[52:43] here for the lost sheep of the house of
[52:45] israel
[52:45] she's not in that kingdom she's not a
[52:47] part of that group i'm not here to help
[52:49] her
[52:50] and when she cried out to him she cried
[52:52] son of david which she had no claims to
[52:54] him for
[52:55] yeah she was not a jew she did not know
[52:57] him or have claims to him the son of
[52:59] david
[53:00] but he ignored her in her first
[53:04] cry to him he ignored her could you
[53:06] imagine what would happen today
[53:08] if you went and asked somebody of some
[53:09] authoritative position
[53:11] and they just flat out ignored you a man
[53:14] is supposed to be a man of great
[53:16] compassion and love and
[53:18] and healing and blessing and the
[53:20] beatitudes and all that jesus laid out
[53:22] to the people
[53:23] and this great man that i want to
[53:25] implore to and believe that he's going
[53:27] to touch my
[53:28] daughter completely ignores me
[53:31] you imagine what most women today would
[53:34] do
[53:35] oh they'd puff up like a bullfrog eating
[53:37] bug shot and they'd walk oh dare him
[53:39] ignore me
[53:41] i'll go someplace else we've got plenty
[53:43] of doctors that can help my daughter
[53:45] wasn't a doctor in the land can help her
[53:47] but jesus christ
[53:49] but you imagine what the attitude would
[53:50] be but this was a godly mother it
[53:52] doesn't matter if she wasn't a jew it
[53:54] doesn't matter if she was the part of
[53:55] the household of the kingdom of god
[53:57] with the being a jew that is it didn't
[54:00] matter to her
[54:01] she knew where she could get help and
[54:03] she was going to get it and she wasn't
[54:04] going to leave there until she got it
[54:06] and it didn't matter what came on her it
[54:08] didn't matter what he said to her or did
[54:10] to her or didn't do to her
[54:12] she was not going to leave until she got
[54:14] what she came for
[54:15] that is the love of a mother yes and
[54:18] that is my title today
[54:19] emma a mother's love a mother's love
[54:23] again it's strange because uh
[54:26] that that's i guess the title for it
[54:28] that hit me today was
[54:29] a mother's love because that in itself
[54:32] stands alone
[54:34] those of you or mothers here today would
[54:36] understand that
[54:37] you would understand the love that you
[54:39] have as a godly mother now of course
[54:41] there's people out here that just birth
[54:42] babies and they're not really mothers
[54:44] uh even though it's inherent in them to
[54:47] want to be a mother
[54:48] they'd rather drown their kid and go
[54:50] spend ten thousand dollars by
[54:51] dogs right they'd rather go dump their
[54:54] kid in the garbage can and go out and
[54:55] spend five grand for a dog
[54:57] to mother than an actual baby but anyway
[55:00] that that's out in the world but i'm
[55:02] talking about real godly mothers
[55:04] godly mothers those that uh that
[55:07] have that love of god in them for their
[55:09] children
[55:10] and that a mother's love came to my
[55:13] heart and i wrote that down and that was
[55:15] going to be the title for today's
[55:16] message now i woke up this morning which
[55:18] i do a lot of times
[55:20] actually every morning i wake up but
[55:23] i got my subjects backwards there
[55:27] many times i'll open up the app and see
[55:30] what the temperature is supposed to be
[55:31] for the day or the weather or something
[55:33] like that
[55:33] and i looked and there's a little
[55:35] headline underneath the temperature
[55:37] and it said a mother's love is boundless
[55:40] and i thought wow that's just confirmed
[55:43] to me the lord just put that on there
[55:45] for me to see
[55:46] and it actually does say a mother's love
[55:48] which is actually my title today
[55:50] a mother's love is without bounds i
[55:52] think is what it says or boundless
[55:54] something like that
[55:54] a mother's love is boundless and that's
[55:56] exactly the description
[55:58] of what i saw in this in this story here
[56:02] this story doesn't encompass but about
[56:04] seven verses in the bible
[56:06] seven verses out of 66 books and all the
[56:09] uh the verses in this bible this only
[56:12] encompasses about
[56:13] seven but look at the power that's
[56:15] contained in those seven verses
[56:17] amen and that mother's love for her
[56:19] daughter
[56:20] she knew where she could get help she
[56:22] knew where she could get what she needed
[56:24] for her daughter
[56:24] and she just wasn't going to lead till
[56:26] she gave until she got it
[56:28] now god jesus ignored her and put her
[56:31] way in
[56:32] and then she cried after the disciples
[56:34] so much that the disciples came to jesus
[56:36] said jesus please
[56:38] get rid of this woman do something to
[56:40] her because she's just
[56:41] she's driving us crazy and she she's
[56:44] wearing us
[56:45] what can we do about this woman we we
[56:47] need to get rid of her somehow
[56:49] and finally she breaks through and gets
[56:52] to jesus
[56:53] and says oh god have mercy on me amen
[56:56] lord jesus and worshiped him jesus
[57:00] have mercy on me and she said i'm not
[57:03] here for the dogs
[57:06] you imagine if she didn't leave after
[57:08] getting ignored the first time she gone
[57:09] now
[57:11] most women anyway right but not godly
[57:14] women
[57:14] they know where they're standing they
[57:16] know where they're standing and they
[57:18] know how to stand
[57:19] because they have god's word standing
[57:21] with them on their behalf
[57:23] and this woman knew where she was
[57:24] standing and she knew what she wanted
[57:26] right she wasn't leaving but how many
[57:30] after being ignored with the lift how
[57:32] many now after being called a dog
[57:35] what have you look you square in the eye
[57:37] and called you a dog
[57:40] how many would have hung around right
[57:42] right how many would get puffed up there
[57:44] and
[57:44] went away and let their pride get
[57:46] bruised and went off you know what she'd
[57:47] have gone off and she'd have buried her
[57:48] dog
[57:50] but she stood right there she stirred
[57:53] firm and true and she looked at him and
[57:56] she said
[57:56] true master but even the dogs eat
[58:00] the crumbs from the master's tape amen
[58:03] she humbled herself right and then she
[58:05] become contrite
[58:06] because she was there needing something
[58:09] and wanting something
[58:10] you know how many times people come to
[58:12] god demanding god
[58:14] do something for them asking god on the
[58:17] on the premise
[58:18] of their pride and basically demanding
[58:21] god do something for them
[58:23] right god i got this down this is
[58:25] written
[58:26] and and basically saying god if you
[58:29] don't do this i won't believe you
[58:30] anymore
[58:32] what what is that to god right
[58:37] your loss but that's the way a lot of
[58:39] times people will approach you
[58:41] it's an ultimatum god i know you can do
[58:44] it you better do it
[58:46] now they might not say it exactly like
[58:48] that but that's
[58:49] or their feeling is and if you don't do
[58:51] it i'm not going to serve you anymore
[58:54] but this woman came with a contrite
[58:55] heart she was humble
[58:57] she wasn't worried about what he was
[58:59] calling her she had a love in her heart
[59:01] for her daughter and she knew the one
[59:03] that could heal her
[59:05] and she stayed there until she got it
[59:08] god looked at this and he wasn't sent
[59:10] for her
[59:12] he told her i'm sent to the outlaw sheep
[59:14] of the house of israel
[59:16] he wasn't sent for her but she still got
[59:18] what she wanted
[59:20] amen and i want you to know what's what
[59:22] the scripture says
[59:25] he said great is thy faith be it unto
[59:28] thee
[59:28] even as thou will right jesus
[59:32] didn't proclaim his daughter's heel you
[59:35] see anywhere that there were in that
[59:36] scripture reading
[59:37] where jesus said thy daughter is healed
[59:40] great
[59:41] i heal her in the name of me
[59:45] or whatever he didn't do that right
[59:48] he just said as you go and you believe
[59:51] you'll find it to be so amen
[59:55] so what did it it was her
[59:58] it was her faith it was what was in her
[1:00:01] heart for her daughter
[1:00:02] that moved the heart of jesus he didn't
[1:00:04] proclaim her and
[1:00:06] uh uh uh healed her mother had done that
[1:00:11] just through her heart her faith and her
[1:00:13] actions
[1:00:14] her faith is what reads god friend and
[1:00:16] we gotta understand that's what reaches
[1:00:18] god all the time is our faith
[1:00:20] amen you can have the most beautiful
[1:00:22] words the most swelling words you can
[1:00:24] stand before
[1:00:25] uh thrones and kingdoms and tens of
[1:00:28] thousands of people with your beautiful
[1:00:30] elegancy and
[1:00:31] and people want a beautiful orchard
[1:00:33] today but you want to have
[1:00:35] somebody that can talk to god
[1:00:38] who can reach god it doesn't matter if
[1:00:40] they know their adverbs and their
[1:00:42] adjectives and their nouns or whatever
[1:00:44] right somebody that can reach god
[1:00:48] somebody that can contact god and the
[1:00:50] only way you can do that is by your
[1:00:52] faith
[1:00:52] and that's what this woman did she
[1:00:54] touched god by her faith
[1:00:56] and she received healing for her
[1:00:58] daughter because she touched god with
[1:01:00] that faith
[1:01:01] he wasn't sent for her but she didn't
[1:01:04] care
[1:01:05] her faith reached god amen and jesus
[1:01:07] said go
[1:01:08] you'll find it as you believe as you say
[1:01:10] that's exactly how it will be
[1:01:13] being unto thee as thou wilt and her
[1:01:16] daughter was healed from that very hour
[1:01:18] amen it was her faith again it was her
[1:01:21] faith that would believe
[1:01:22] it was her faith that moved the hand of
[1:01:24] god and she was going to do what she had
[1:01:26] to do to get it
[1:01:28] amen and she got it and her daughter was
[1:01:30] healed
[1:01:32] reminds me of a story that brother
[1:01:33] branham told one time
[1:01:35] um let me see here got it printed out
[1:01:41] you probably remember this story i got a
[1:01:43] couple stories i want to read today
[1:01:44] that's okay good examples of a mother's
[1:01:50] love
[1:01:52] look at this when divine love is
[1:01:54] projected sovereign grace takes its
[1:01:56] place
[1:01:57] 1957 and then a little mother was
[1:02:00] screaming
[1:02:01] when i called for the prayer line and
[1:02:02] billy come to me and said daddy
[1:02:04] you're going to have to do something
[1:02:06] sounds a little familiar doesn't it
[1:02:08] the disciples came to jesus and said
[1:02:10] jesus you're going to have to do
[1:02:12] something
[1:02:12] we can't hold her back anymore billy
[1:02:15] comes to his dead he says daddy you got
[1:02:17] to do
[1:02:17] something a mother's baby died at three
[1:02:20] o'clock this afternoon the little
[1:02:21] captain woman
[1:02:22] her baby is dead and she's uh got it all
[1:02:25] covered up
[1:02:26] said when brother espinosa gave out the
[1:02:28] prayer card she didn't get one
[1:02:30] but there isn't enough ushers to hold
[1:02:33] that
[1:02:34] woman from this platform anymore right
[1:02:37] one woman holding a little baby
[1:02:40] swallowing clothes
[1:02:41] and there wasn't enough men ushers
[1:02:44] to hold her back right
[1:02:48] that's the heart of a mother that's a
[1:02:50] mother's love wanting to get something
[1:02:51] for her baby
[1:02:52] yes and she knew where she could get it
[1:02:54] and she knew where she stood and she
[1:02:55] knew how she could get it
[1:02:57] and she was going to the right place
[1:02:59] right not necessarily brother branham
[1:03:01] but to
[1:03:02] jesus christ she knew how to get it
[1:03:05] amen there wasn't enough ushers to keep
[1:03:08] her from that platform
[1:03:10] hey man she got that baby screaming to
[1:03:13] the top of her voice padre padre which
[1:03:16] means father
[1:03:17] a look down through that long streak of
[1:03:18] life and that woman frantically
[1:03:20] beautiful little lady
[1:03:22] tears streaming down her cheeks watering
[1:03:24] her arms screaming to the top of her
[1:03:26] voice
[1:03:27] i said to brother moore standing on the
[1:03:28] platform one of the managers i said go
[1:03:30] down and pray for the baby
[1:03:32] maybe that will console her little
[1:03:35] mother's love for that baby
[1:03:37] i turned to the audience to minister
[1:03:39] again i looked over at the audience i've
[1:03:41] seen the little spanish baby
[1:03:42] now this is a vision now brother
[1:03:44] branham's having he turns to the
[1:03:46] congregation there the audience since he
[1:03:47] calls it

[1:03:51] when he sees this vision he sees this
[1:03:54] little spanish baby
[1:03:55] setting up going amen there you go
[1:03:59] brother moore was trying to quieten her
[1:04:01] but he didn't satisfy her little heart
[1:04:03] a mother's love was being projected to
[1:04:06] god
[1:04:07] there you go a mother's love being
[1:04:09] projected to god
[1:04:11] this mother's love sin and i want to
[1:04:13] tell you friend

[1:04:16] i'm here today is because my mother's
[1:04:18] love
[1:04:20] that's the only reason i'm here today is
[1:04:21] because of my mother's love
[1:04:23] amen when i was worthless and in sin and
[1:04:26] wasn't worth saving
[1:04:28] my mother prayed for me right yeah my
[1:04:30] mother's love and my mother's prayer
[1:04:33] prayer prevailed before god and brought
[1:04:35] me to this to the place that i was to me
[1:04:37] right amen and i'm here today because of
[1:04:40] her
[1:04:40] yeah i miss her a lot
[1:04:44] this is a day i would be spending time
[1:04:46] talking to her on the phone
[1:04:48] right and i miss her greatly but i'm
[1:04:50] here because of her
[1:04:52] amen you look at these and as we read
[1:04:55] those stories
[1:04:56] and think about that i'm sorry if you do
[1:04:59] it maybe some of you didn't have a godly
[1:05:01] mother
[1:05:01] i don't know and and i'm sorry that you
[1:05:04] didn't but i'm so thankful i did
[1:05:06] amen maybe god knew that you would be
[1:05:08] able to come in
[1:05:09] even without the godly mother but god
[1:05:11] knew that i didn't have a chance unless
[1:05:13] i had a mother
[1:05:14] a godly mother praying for me amen amen
[1:05:17] i i've seen my mother prostrate before
[1:05:20] the lord i've seen her speak
[1:05:22] in tongues i've seen her raise and
[1:05:23] praise the lord i've i've seen her
[1:05:25] i've seen her sing songs till her she
[1:05:28] went
[1:05:29] hoarse my mother wrote over to 300 songs
[1:05:34] she one was her favorite the token but
[1:05:36] uh
[1:05:37] she sang and sang until she just
[1:05:39] couldn't sing anymore she loved to sing
[1:05:41] couldn't sing a lick she was like
[1:05:42] brother brandon just
[1:05:43] i mean you put a ten buckle on her head
[1:05:45] and it wouldn't sound any better
[1:05:47] but she loved to sing and i guarantee
[1:05:50] you one thing
[1:05:51] she might not have been able to touch
[1:05:53] hollywood but she touched the heart of
[1:05:54] god
[1:05:55] amen her voice might not have been
[1:05:57] something you'd put on records
[1:05:59] for to be sold by catholic or whatever
[1:06:01] but i guarantee you it's played today in
[1:06:03] the in the end
[1:06:04] of heaven yes praise the lord amen
[1:06:06] because of the godly mother i had i'll
[1:06:08] brag on her a little bit i love her
[1:06:10] she's here
[1:06:11] amen so i'm very thankful if you didn't
[1:06:14] maybe again maybe that was just god knew
[1:06:16] you'd be able to come in without one but
[1:06:18] he knew i wouldn't so he gave me a good
[1:06:20] godly mother and that's the reason i'm
[1:06:22] here today
[1:06:23] but a mother's love oh praise the lord a
[1:06:26] mother's love
[1:06:27] being projected to god and think about
[1:06:30] that i said just a moment brother moore
[1:06:34] i went down the baby was wadded up in
[1:06:36] some blankets
[1:06:37] i couldn't speak spanish to her neither
[1:06:39] could i understand hers
[1:06:41] but i just laid my hands on that little
[1:06:43] blanket that was wet
[1:06:44] because she'd been outside standing in
[1:06:46] the rain all day holding that baby
[1:06:49] her baby had died at 3 o'clock that day
[1:06:51] she went to the doctors
[1:06:52] and standing out in the rain for the
[1:06:53] service it was eight or nine o'clock
[1:06:55] that night
[1:06:56] she'd been standing there waiting with
[1:06:57] that dead baby in her arms
[1:06:59] blanket was wet
[1:07:02] now they tell me the baby had died about
[1:07:04] three o'clock i don't know
[1:07:05] couldn't say the dead people that i have
[1:07:08] written in my book
[1:07:09] is authentic that was raised by the lord
[1:07:12] from the dead the doctors would have to
[1:07:14] say so or the undertaker
[1:07:16] but laying hands on the baby something
[1:07:19] of course the baby let out a big kick
[1:07:22] under that cover
[1:07:23] and a scream that like you've never
[1:07:25] heard in your life
[1:07:26] what was it divine love had projected to
[1:07:30] the heart of god
[1:07:31] the love of god and sovereign grace sent
[1:07:33] back the vision for the healing for the
[1:07:35] child
[1:07:36] amen the woman got what she wanted she
[1:07:39] was persevering
[1:07:40] she stayed before the lord just like
[1:07:42] this woman that
[1:07:44] that jesus called a dog and wasn't
[1:07:46] enough ushers could hold that woman back
[1:07:48] the supernatural strength of this mother
[1:07:51] with her heart this dead baby
[1:07:53] wanting her wanted grace from god
[1:07:56] desiring and needing grace from god
[1:07:59] looking for god to have mercy on her
[1:08:01] child and a gift that was in a prophet
[1:08:04] to be able to show a vision
[1:08:06] and lay hands on that little baby to
[1:08:08] bring it back to life
[1:08:09] amen reminds me one time of uh uh of
[1:08:12] that story where this woman's out there
[1:08:14] and
[1:08:15] uh and and the congregation and and the
[1:08:18] lord speaks to her about this
[1:08:20] uh about this person that was uh in the
[1:08:23] prayer line to get healed by brother
[1:08:24] branham you thought well
[1:08:26] and god spoke to her and said go pray
[1:08:27] for her and
[1:08:29] and you know if you're standing and you
[1:08:32] know what we know and
[1:08:34] you're standing in line for the prophet
[1:08:36] of god to come pray for you or you come
[1:08:37] in the prayer line you're going to get
[1:08:38] prayed for by me
[1:08:40] and god speaks to you go pray for you
[1:08:42] probably think well
[1:08:43] uh why uh she's getting ready to be
[1:08:46] prayed by brother branham she's getting
[1:08:47] prayed to be praised by the prophet of
[1:08:49] god so why
[1:08:49] why should i go pray for god said pray
[1:08:51] for her
[1:08:53] and so she obeyed that voice and she
[1:08:55] went up lay hands on that lady said may
[1:08:57] i pray for you she said certainly sister
[1:08:59] she lay hands on her prayed for nothing
[1:09:01] happened it was
[1:09:02] the sky didn't open the the moon didn't
[1:09:04] fall
[1:09:05] uh there was no fireworks or nothing
[1:09:07] that's
[1:09:09] great things exploding all around she
[1:09:11] just went and sat back down
[1:09:14] this woman finally gets around she comes
[1:09:15] up to brother brown and brother branham
[1:09:17] holds her hand and she says sister
[1:09:18] you've already been healed
[1:09:21] she said there's no he said there's no
[1:09:22] need in prayer for you me because you're
[1:09:24] already healed
[1:09:25] she said god put on a heart of that
[1:09:27] sister sitting right back there and
[1:09:28] prayed for you right there you're healed
[1:09:30] right there
[1:09:30] go home and be well amen that was the
[1:09:32] end of it right
[1:09:34] because she had obeyed god to lay hands
[1:09:37] on her
[1:09:38] that that that and that's what moved the
[1:09:40] hand of god that healed that woman
[1:09:42] that that faith that brought her up and
[1:09:45] and surely she came all the way through
[1:09:47] but this gift on a man could tell that
[1:09:50] she was already prayed for that she was
[1:09:52] already healed
[1:09:53] because of the obedience of someone
[1:09:55] being able to stand before god and have
[1:09:57] the faith to believe
[1:09:59] that god was going to do what he
[1:10:00] promised he'd do
[1:10:02] amen now that's the same to any of us
[1:10:04] today friend
[1:10:05] he's the same god now as he was then
[1:10:09] he he didn't change his uh his god
[1:10:12] just because brother brown went off the
[1:10:13] scene
[1:10:14] he didn't die or go to sleep just
[1:10:16] because brother branham was saying we
[1:10:18] know
[1:10:18] that friend we've seen god move so
[1:10:20] powerfully here
[1:10:21] that that uh it's hard to describe
[1:10:25] sometimes
[1:10:26] right just the miracles the things that
[1:10:28] god's been doing for us and feeling his
[1:10:30] presence
[1:10:31] and knowing that he's real he's still
[1:10:33] the same today
[1:10:34] he's still a healer he's still a savior
[1:10:36] he's still a deliverer
[1:10:38] he still answers questions he still
[1:10:40] gives you deliverance and strength he
[1:10:42] still watches over you and leads you and
[1:10:43] guides you yes
[1:10:44] he's still the same right now as he has
[1:10:46] always been
[1:10:48] amen we just got to believe that now
[1:10:51] these mothers
[1:10:52] and that heart of my mother now that
[1:10:54] that faith
[1:10:56] shouldn't be exclusive to mothers but
[1:10:58] there's something special about it
[1:11:00] there's something special about that
[1:11:02] love and those prayers that go before
[1:11:04] god
[1:11:05] there's nobody can pray for a child
[1:11:09] that will equal right the prayer of a
[1:11:12] mother
[1:11:12] won't do it dad can pray for him
[1:11:14] absolutely we can come close sometimes
[1:11:17] but there's nothing that can touch that
[1:11:19] prayer of a mother it just can't do it
[1:11:21] right when it prevails before god and
[1:11:24] the true heart of that mother reaching
[1:11:26] to god
[1:11:27] it's not how good you can pray about it
[1:11:30] it's not how many times necessary you
[1:11:32] can pray
[1:11:32] but when your heart reaches to god for
[1:11:35] that child
[1:11:36] there's nothing prevails more than that
[1:11:38] does
[1:11:39] amen nothing it's just
[1:11:44] it's just the power of god that god put
[1:11:48] in her to be able to do
[1:11:49] president is something that god gave
[1:11:52] and that's that that spirit of female
[1:11:57] of woman now the world tries to muddle
[1:12:00] it all up of course with their
[1:12:01] what they call biology or whatever and
[1:12:04] men can be women and women can be men
[1:12:05] and men can
[1:12:06] even they're even talking about changing
[1:12:08] mother's day to birth person day
[1:12:11] birth people day because it's not just a
[1:12:14] woman
[1:12:15] you know you you know a man can give
[1:12:17] birth right didn't you know that
[1:12:19] oh it's silly anyway i don't want to get
[1:12:22] in that's just garbage
[1:12:23] but but still
[1:12:26] every day should be a mother's day but
[1:12:28] that mother
[1:12:29] this god put in her something special
[1:12:32] see and i think
[1:12:33] that's the reason the world combats it
[1:12:35] so hard
[1:12:37] it's because it's something that's godly
[1:12:39] something that's inherent and given to a
[1:12:41] mother that
[1:12:42] that no one else has and can't have
[1:12:46] won't have that baby lives under the
[1:12:48] mother's heart for nine months
[1:12:51] and that connection that grows and
[1:12:52] they're not just physically connected by
[1:12:54] the umbilical cord
[1:12:55] they're become spiritually connected
[1:12:57] together
[1:12:59] and there's nothing that can change that
[1:13:02] think about that
[1:13:02] think about that prayer think about that
[1:13:05] heart of a mother that stopped the jumbo
[1:13:07] jet in
[1:13:08] mid-flight and set it down in memphis
[1:13:11] tennessee
[1:13:13] you ever thought of that the prayer of a
[1:13:16] mother
[1:13:17] woman who probably couldn't even say her
[1:13:19] abc's
[1:13:20] little wash woman prayed to god and
[1:13:23] brought down a jumbo jet
[1:13:25] in the middle of its flight he meant
[1:13:27] safely of course it didn't crash
[1:13:29] we all know what i'm talking about yeah
[1:13:31] that time that brother brown was on that
[1:13:33] plane
[1:13:34] and that that colored woman was praying
[1:13:37] to god
[1:13:38] she considered herself in the scripture
[1:13:40] like that chinamite woman
[1:13:42] and she prayed to god and as she was
[1:13:44] praying to god a prophet of god was
[1:13:46] flying overhead
[1:13:47] and god said it's time for him to go
[1:13:49] across her path
[1:13:50] and he brought that plane down and they
[1:13:52] had to they had to land halfway in their
[1:13:54] trip he had to land that plane i believe
[1:13:56] it's memphis tennessee wasn't it
[1:13:58] land that plane there and everybody had
[1:14:02] to get off
[1:14:03] and brother brennan doesn't know what's
[1:14:05] going on you know people a lot of times
[1:14:07] today i'll say oh brother ralph knew
[1:14:09] everything no he didn't
[1:14:10] right he absolutely did not he was the
[1:14:13] prophet of god
[1:14:14] but he only knew what god showed him yes
[1:14:17] and sometimes it was only a step at a
[1:14:19] time
[1:14:20] because this prophet with his own
[1:14:21] testimony gets off the plane
[1:14:24] and god says walk with me he takes him
[1:14:28] down this road
[1:14:29] turn left he toads hurts left and god
[1:14:32] i'm gonna miss my plane i gotta get back
[1:14:34] on that plane to go where i'm supposed
[1:14:35] to be
[1:14:37] walk with me yes turns him this way
[1:14:40] turns him that way
[1:14:41] and he comes across that color woman
[1:14:43] standing at her gate
[1:14:44] the story picks up led by the spirit i
[1:14:47] was going along
[1:14:48] humming to myself and i noticed this old
[1:14:50] lady
[1:14:51] she looked across the gate great big
[1:14:53] smile across her face
[1:14:55] she got a great big smile across her
[1:14:57] face when her baby boys lay in the bed
[1:14:59] dying
[1:15:00] now i say baby boy he was six foot tall
[1:15:03] 180 pounds
[1:15:05] but that was her baby boy right always
[1:15:07] will be your baby boy
[1:15:09] amen regardless he could be 10 foot tall
[1:15:11] 400 pounds be her baby boy
[1:15:13] always amen sometimes that's a tough
[1:15:17] that's a tough thing too because the
[1:15:20] mother
[1:15:20] uh and i don't say this in a derogatory
[1:15:24] way but a mother's always a mother
[1:15:26] even when the children grow up and they
[1:15:29] leave home
[1:15:30] that mother's always the mother it don't
[1:15:32] matter how old they get
[1:15:33] it don't matter if they have a family of
[1:15:34] their own that mother is always a mother
[1:15:36] and it's hard sometimes for that mother
[1:15:38] to quit being mother
[1:15:41] amen sometimes it's hard for that mother
[1:15:44] to quit being mother
[1:15:45] because they're always going to be
[1:15:46] mother right but it comes a time when
[1:15:49] their mother that they're the ones
[1:15:51] that's to take care of their families
[1:15:52] and not the mother mother
[1:15:54] and it's hard to do sometimes yeah
[1:15:56] because she's always going to be a
[1:15:57] mother
[1:15:58] so maybe that's something for the
[1:15:59] mothers to understand grandmothers to
[1:16:01] understand
[1:16:02] maybe the daughters don't understand the
[1:16:04] fact is that
[1:16:05] sometimes it comes a time when the
[1:16:07] daughter's got to be the daughter
[1:16:09] and she's and then she's got to be the
[1:16:10] mother and she's got to be the mother of
[1:16:12] her family she's got to be the matriarch
[1:16:14] of her family amen and and
[1:16:17] and sometimes it's hard to let go right
[1:16:20] yeah
[1:16:21] amen but i mean the truth of it is
[1:16:24] uh as much as the as much as the dollars
[1:16:27] become like the mothers the sons become
[1:16:29] like the deaths
[1:16:30] but the dollars become like the the
[1:16:32] others the daughter's different than the
[1:16:34] mother
[1:16:35] that's right they're gonna do some
[1:16:36] things differently than the mother
[1:16:38] she's gonna do some things worse than
[1:16:40] the mother she's gonna do some things
[1:16:42] better than the mother but she's now the
[1:16:44] mother
[1:16:44] right amen sometimes i tell my wife
[1:16:48] here none of our business
[1:16:52] they're the mother it's their kids
[1:16:53] they're they're the parents see
[1:16:55] right and but i understand because
[1:16:58] that's the heart of that's the heart of
[1:17:00] a mother
[1:17:00] that's crying out it's still there we'll
[1:17:03] always be there
[1:17:05] so again daughters if you have mothers
[1:17:08] understand it's always going to be there
[1:17:11] right the heart of that mother is always
[1:17:13] good but she bugs me it drives me crazy
[1:17:15] but the heart is always going to be
[1:17:16] there
[1:17:17] be thankful of that be thankful
[1:17:21] but this woman now brother bam says she
[1:17:23] had a great big smile across her face
[1:17:25] i stopped humming and i started on by
[1:17:29] she said good
[1:17:30] morning parse i said how do you know
[1:17:32] auntie
[1:17:33] she just started grinding the great big
[1:17:34] tears rolling off those cheeks
[1:17:37] i said how did you know i was a parson
[1:17:40] now parson means minister
[1:17:41] she said i know you was coming now see
[1:17:44] god had showed her what was going to
[1:17:47] happen
[1:17:48] but god hadn't shown it to brother brown
[1:17:51] he showed he showed the woman praying
[1:17:53] that he was going to send her her elijah
[1:17:56] but he didn't show elijah he didn't show
[1:17:57] brother brown that he was going to send
[1:17:59] him over there
[1:18:00] all he knows is the plane had problems i
[1:18:02] had to land in memphis and god said go
[1:18:04] with me
[1:18:05] walk with me for a while he walks right
[1:18:07] in front of this woman's house and she
[1:18:09] sees him and said hello
[1:18:11] how did you know i was a person i knew
[1:18:13] you was coming
[1:18:15] i said how auntie how did you know i was
[1:18:17] coming she said well
[1:18:18] i'll tell you it was like this person
[1:18:20] she said did you ever read that story in
[1:18:22] the bible
[1:18:22] about the shunammite woman who the lord
[1:18:24] gave a baby by the promise of elijah
[1:18:27] the prophet gave her and i said oh sure
[1:18:31] i'm well acquainted with her story
[1:18:33] i just preached on it a few weeks ago
[1:18:35] well she said
[1:18:36] i was that kind of woman and i didn't
[1:18:38] have any children
[1:18:40] and and uh and the husband and i wanted
[1:18:42] a baby so bad and i prayed and the lord
[1:18:45] gave me this baby
[1:18:46] i told him i'd dedicate that baby to him
[1:18:49] and said i just wish
[1:18:50] i i was washed over the washboard person
[1:18:52] she said i was a wash woman in this
[1:18:54] district
[1:18:55] said i raised that boy the best of my
[1:18:57] knowledge to the love of the lord
[1:18:59] and sometimes that that's that's what
[1:19:02] you do right
[1:19:02] or not sometimes that's what you do
[1:19:05] raise it to the best of your ability
[1:19:07] because sometimes the love of a mother
[1:19:09] looks
[1:19:10] confusing sometimes the mother the love
[1:19:13] of a mother can look strict
[1:19:14] sometimes sometimes the love of a mother
[1:19:16] is corrected
[1:19:17] many times the love of a mother is
[1:19:19] misunderstood
[1:19:20] sometimes it's affectionate sometimes
[1:19:22] it's uh uh
[1:19:24] loving and compassionate but sometimes
[1:19:27] it's corrective
[1:19:28] because that mother has the
[1:19:29] responsibility of raising that child and
[1:19:31] the nurturing admonition of god
[1:19:33] right and that child starts straying off
[1:19:35] that path it's the mother's
[1:19:36] responsibility to get it back on that
[1:19:37] path
[1:19:38] yeah amen yes and if that and
[1:19:41] and and the bible says that there to
[1:19:43] train that child the way that you go
[1:19:45] that's her responsibility it's not her
[1:19:48] responsibility to plop that child down
[1:19:49] in front of a tv and expect that tv to
[1:19:51] raise them
[1:19:52] right it's that mother's responsibility
[1:19:54] to do it it's not the
[1:19:56] not the responsibility of all the rest
[1:19:57] of the world hollywood and everybody
[1:19:59] else to try to raise your child
[1:20:00] it's your responsibility to raise that
[1:20:02] child and that's the problem we have a
[1:20:04] lot of times today is they don't want to
[1:20:05] raise their children
[1:20:06] they'd rather have a dog or a cat or
[1:20:08] something raise them because the dog the
[1:20:10] cat well they're just going to do
[1:20:11] whatever
[1:20:11] whatever i tell them to do they won't
[1:20:14] fuss and
[1:20:14] fight back well if they don't then you
[1:20:17] don't have a child
[1:20:19] you don't have a baby you don't have a
[1:20:21] human with a soul with a free will
[1:20:24] right right right and then what have you
[1:20:25] got a bunch of mush
[1:20:28] a lot of times parents today just think
[1:20:29] their child should raise themselves yeah
[1:20:32] oh i'll when they're 10 or 12 they'll
[1:20:34] tell me if they're a boy or a girl
[1:20:35] i'll hogwash oh they'll tell me this no
[1:20:38] that that's that is so ungodly
[1:20:42] so demonic friends oh i want them to be
[1:20:45] whatever
[1:20:46] they want to be and do whatever they
[1:20:48] want to do oh
[1:20:51] that is wrong and a godly mother won't
[1:20:54] let that happen
[1:20:57] a godly mother will put that child on
[1:20:59] the right path and show them the way
[1:21:00] they're supposed to go by the scripture
[1:21:03] and how they're supposed to live that's
[1:21:04] a godly mother yes
[1:21:06] a godly mother is not going to say oh
[1:21:08] just go and do whatever you want to
[1:21:10] and live however you want no it doesn't
[1:21:11] work that way that's a mother that
[1:21:13] doesn't love
[1:21:14] that child right a mother that loves
[1:21:16] their child who
[1:21:18] will teach him right give him a little
[1:21:20] protoplasm stimulation once in a while
[1:21:22] even
[1:21:23] amen i still believe it's scripture yes
[1:21:27] it's very unpopular in the world today
[1:21:29] but it's still what the bible says
[1:21:31] amen you try to do it any other way
[1:21:33] friend it does not work
[1:21:34] that's right i prayed the lord gave me
[1:21:37] this baby i told him i dedicated to him
[1:21:39] said i want i'm a wash woman i'm a
[1:21:42] washed woman in this district i raised
[1:21:44] that boy the best
[1:21:45] knowledge the love is and the love of
[1:21:47] the lord
[1:21:48] she said he got out with the wrong
[1:21:50] company and taken a social disease
[1:21:52] and we and we didn't know nothing about
[1:21:55] no social disease and our boy got sicker
[1:21:58] and sicker
[1:21:59] finally we take him to the doctor he
[1:22:01] said there's no hope for him he's gone
[1:22:03] the venereal disease had got into his
[1:22:05] bloodstream and eaten up parts of his
[1:22:07] heart
[1:22:09] the venereal disease had eaten up parts
[1:22:11] of this boy's
[1:22:12] heart you imagine the stuff that's going
[1:22:15] on out there today
[1:22:17] the diseases and the afflictions well i
[1:22:20] like that song that zach saying
[1:22:22] he is our he is our shield amen
[1:22:25] i like that a lot of times we forget uh
[1:22:28] that he's our shield
[1:22:29] that he protects us right that he keeps
[1:22:32] us yes
[1:22:33] amen that's why i told you several times
[1:22:35] i pray god keep his heads around you
[1:22:37] right
[1:22:38] you may keep it from all the germs
[1:22:39] diseases the cove but all that mess
[1:22:41] he's a shield yes amen amen i believe
[1:22:43] that yes
[1:22:44] sir this neural disease had gotten eaten
[1:22:47] up parts of his heart and when the blood
[1:22:49] would pump
[1:22:50] up so much of it would drop back through
[1:22:52] the vows in his heart
[1:22:53] was eaten off by the disease
[1:22:56] dr uh doctor said there was no no chance
[1:22:59] for him
[1:23:00] he said he's lying there on the bed he's
[1:23:02] been unconscious for two days
[1:23:04] i can't stand to see my baby die like
[1:23:06] that and i prayed
[1:23:07] all last night lord you give me this
[1:23:10] baby where is my elijah
[1:23:12] amen again she considered herself like
[1:23:15] this unified woman lord you gave me the
[1:23:17] baby now where's my elijah
[1:23:18] right my baby's laying here dying
[1:23:21] where's my elijah

[1:23:24] that part yet and i don't remember if
[1:23:26] it's in this
[1:23:27] you know he tells a story 40 times
[1:23:30] and i don't know if it's even in this
[1:23:32] part of the story but
[1:23:34] this woman wasn't even necessarily
[1:23:36] caring
[1:23:37] that the lord would uh would take him
[1:23:40] right her concern wasn't that he was
[1:23:43] dying
[1:23:44] she was her concern was that he was
[1:23:46] dying a center and going to hell
[1:23:48] right that was her concern she wanted
[1:23:51] him saved
[1:23:52] yes yeah she wanted her voice saved to
[1:23:55] where she was
[1:23:56] where if he did go he would go to be
[1:23:58] with the lord
[1:24:00] that was her concern that's the greatest
[1:24:03] concern too
[1:24:04] right because that's what matters the
[1:24:05] most amen
[1:24:08] she said i prayed all night lord you
[1:24:10] gave me this baby now where's my elijah

[1:24:34] pray for the sick which he did many
[1:24:36] miracles and things happened which did
[1:24:39] she even care about that right that
[1:24:40] wasn't her concern
[1:24:42] she was just asking god for elijah god
[1:24:44] sent him and god
[1:24:45] showed her that who who was going to
[1:24:48] come and pray for her baby that he would
[1:24:49] be saved

[1:25:01] coming wearing a little tan suit
[1:25:03] with a little western hat struck over on
[1:25:05] one side of his head
[1:25:06] he had uh and had some letters in his
[1:25:09] hand
[1:25:10] and i said uh the lord said go out and
[1:25:12] wait for him
[1:25:14] at three o'clock in the morning the lord
[1:25:16] told her
[1:25:17] go out and wait for him so she went out
[1:25:20] to wait for him
[1:25:22] she said i've been standing here ever
[1:25:25] since
[1:25:26] brother vance says i patted her on the
[1:25:27] back and her back was wet with the dew
[1:25:30] that fell
[1:25:31] that's how long she'd been standing
[1:25:32] there waiting on her elijah
[1:25:34] kind of reminds you of the woman in here
[1:25:37] kind of reminds you the
[1:25:39] the mexican lady there wasn't enough
[1:25:40] deacons to hold her back
[1:25:42] amen she stood there from three o'clock
[1:25:45] in the morning he never says that i can
[1:25:46] remember may him in a different story
[1:25:48] what time it was that day
[1:25:49] but she had been standing there so long
[1:25:51] her clothes were
[1:25:52] wet from the from the dew that had been
[1:25:54] following us
[1:25:55] my it was true and i said well
[1:25:58] uh my ministry is praying for the sick
[1:26:01] hunting she wasn't interested in that
[1:26:03] she said won't you come in she opened up
[1:26:05] a little gate
[1:26:06] plow point hanging on the chain i walked
[1:26:09] into that little old hut that morning
[1:26:11] two
[1:26:11] little two room hut no no rug on the
[1:26:14] floor
[1:26:14] nor nothing little old poster bed
[1:26:18] cracks in the floor big enough the wind
[1:26:19] just swept through it
[1:26:21] he said i've been in king's palaces
[1:26:24] i've been i've had the privilege of
[1:26:26] being in some of the nicest homes i
[1:26:28] guess in the world
[1:26:29] but i never felt any more at home in all
[1:26:32] my life than i did in that little hut
[1:26:34] that morning amen
[1:26:36] god's not concerned about all the
[1:26:38] grandeur of life friends right a lot of
[1:26:40] times we hold
[1:26:41] it so close and dear and think about he
[1:26:44] wasn't concerned about that god's not
[1:26:46] concerned about that
[1:26:47] amen but the presence that was there the
[1:26:50] welcome that was there
[1:26:52] right he said greater than anything he's
[1:26:54] ever been in
[1:26:55] a look on the wall there was no pinups
[1:26:58] little model on the wall that said god
[1:27:00] bless our home
[1:27:01] little chunk stove set in the corner
[1:27:03] post bed leg
[1:27:05] fine looking big man laid there on that
[1:27:07] bed about 170 pounds six foot tall

[1:27:12] on oh
[1:27:14] oh it's dark he said i said what what's
[1:27:17] he saying
[1:27:18] she said parson he's been talking like
[1:27:20] that the past two days
[1:27:22] been unconscious said in his
[1:27:24] unconsciousness he thinks he's in a
[1:27:26] great sea
[1:27:27] somewhere lost in the dark he's pulling
[1:27:29] a boat trying to find land
[1:27:31] and i can't stand to see my baby die
[1:27:33] like that
[1:27:36] she went over and stroked his head
[1:27:37] kissed him on the cheek said god bless
[1:27:39] mommy's baby
[1:27:41] great big fellow like fellow like that
[1:27:43] dying in the shame of sin yet that
[1:27:45] that mother's love went to her baby
[1:27:48] praise the lord no matter how much
[1:27:51] disgrace he was
[1:27:53] how he had disgraced the family it was
[1:27:56] still the love of that mother that went
[1:27:58] out for her baby
[1:28:00] i think of that sometimes seeing a
[1:28:01] mother ever forget her suckling baby
[1:28:03] but god said how can i forget you your
[1:28:05] names are engraved in the palm of my
[1:28:07] hand
[1:28:08] so backslider tonight brother brandon
[1:28:10] says remember you can't get away from it
[1:28:12] he still loves you
[1:28:13] that's why you're here tonight he's
[1:28:15] trying to give you another chance
[1:28:16] knocking at your door
[1:28:18] i got down on the floor to pray she got
[1:28:20] down by my side
[1:28:22] uh uh got down by the side of his head
[1:28:25] and i got down to his feet
[1:28:27] i touched his feet and it seemed like it
[1:28:28] was cold sticky
[1:28:30] certainly death was on the boy i said
[1:28:32] auntie being that you are the mother of
[1:28:34] the boy won't you pray first
[1:28:36] she said certainly parson she bowed her
[1:28:38] head
[1:28:40] you talk about a prayer you could tell
[1:28:43] it wasn't learned in some school it come
[1:28:46] from the bottom of her heart
[1:28:48] speaking to god you could tell she had
[1:28:51] talked to him before
[1:28:52] amen she knew what she was speaking
[1:28:55] about and when she got through praying
[1:28:57] she wiped the tears from her eyes with
[1:28:58] her old apron
[1:28:59] looked over at me and said and he said i
[1:29:01] will pray now auntie
[1:29:03] i put my hands on his feet i said lord i
[1:29:06] don't know what to say
[1:29:08] is this why you made me miss my airplane
[1:29:10] to come down here to pray for this
[1:29:12] woman's boy
[1:29:13] if it is lord let it be let it be known
[1:29:16] that your god and your respect her
[1:29:19] prayers
[1:29:20] you'll respect her prayers and her
[1:29:22] sincerity and about that time that big
[1:29:25] fella said oh mama
[1:29:27] it's getting light in the room praise
[1:29:30] the lord
[1:29:31] the darkness gone away in a few minutes
[1:29:33] he was sitting on the side of the bed
[1:29:35] talking to us i rushed out quickly said
[1:29:37] get a cab to go the airport because you
[1:29:39] know he's worried about catching his
[1:29:40] flight
[1:29:41] right because the airplane had landed
[1:29:43] and he knew the plane was going to take
[1:29:44] off before he got back over there
[1:29:47] and he said so he got out of there quick
[1:29:50] and got an air a a cab to the airport
[1:29:52] i got to the gate and the last call for
[1:29:55] the plane was being made
[1:29:56] god had held that plane on the ground by
[1:29:59] faith by an ill uh a illiterate woman
[1:30:03] that probably don't know her abc's some
[1:30:06] poor colored woman ignorant as she would
[1:30:09] as we would call it
[1:30:10] and god grounded that plane and held it
[1:30:14] until her prayer was in the eye amen
[1:30:17] held that plane there
[1:30:18] now you think it's a big thing with a
[1:30:20] woman can't be held back by a bunch of
[1:30:22] ushers
[1:30:22] think about him holding back a how many
[1:30:24] times how much planes weigh
[1:30:27] how many tons does a plane weigh
[1:30:30] and yet this woman's prayer wasn't just
[1:30:32] a few deacons
[1:30:34] held a 10 ton 20 ton i don't know how
[1:30:37] much a plane weighs
[1:30:39] on the ground for a prophet to come and
[1:30:41] pray for her boy
[1:30:42] yes and her prayers he said kept that
[1:30:44] plane on the ground
[1:30:45] till he could get back on it and finish
[1:30:48] on the rest of his journey
[1:30:50] oh if we could just recognize
[1:30:54] him today that the power of the faith
[1:30:59] and of course tap into it if we can just
[1:31:01] as little bit as we can as briefly as we
[1:31:03] can
[1:31:04] to the power of that faith to the power
[1:31:07] of that
[1:31:08] uh of that humility and that love
[1:31:11] you remember the bible says in galatians
[1:31:13] that faith operates by love right
[1:31:16] amen so you can say you have all the
[1:31:18] faith in the world but if you don't have
[1:31:20] the love to operate
[1:31:21] it doesn't mean anything right you got
[1:31:23] to have the dynamics and the mechanics
[1:31:26] it's got to be the mechanics of faith
[1:31:28] but the diamond dynamics to love
[1:31:30] has got to work with it to make it work
[1:31:32] to make it accomplish what you're

[1:33:09] living in sin but how could you say that
[1:33:11] about your child
[1:33:14] not foolish virgin believe and pray and
[1:33:19] let that heart of that mother reach to
[1:33:21] god to bring that child to his

[1:33:36] that kind of faith or just let it go

[1:33:40] they just let it go
[1:33:43] but friend there's still breath there's
[1:33:45] still life

[1:33:59] what can god not do right now
[1:34:03] don't ever think like that don't ever
[1:34:07] take that segue to go out
[1:34:10] and take them out to where they're not
[1:34:13] christians anymore
[1:34:14] or or or not bribe or or saved
[1:34:18] believe and hold on and let it happen
[1:34:21] amen
[1:34:21] it's believing it's true god can bring
[1:34:24] it to pass
[1:34:25] yes he can do anything he wants amen
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:28] you know the story of solomon even the
[1:34:31] story of solomon
[1:34:32] that woman loved her child so much
[1:34:35] she was willing to let some other liar
[1:34:37] woman
[1:34:38] raise that child then have it cut into
[1:34:40] pieces
[1:34:42] remember the two women came to solomon
[1:34:43] this woman didn't have a baby come to
[1:34:45] solomon
[1:34:46] solomon judge probably one of the
[1:34:47] greatest stories the wisest man and
[1:34:49] people he still talk about today
[1:34:52] he said well i tell you what just cut
[1:34:54] the baby in half and give
[1:34:56] half to this woman and half of that
[1:34:57] woman
[1:34:59] and that one woman says yeah cut him in
[1:35:01] half i'll take half of him
[1:35:02] the other one says no no no no no don't
[1:35:04] cut him don't hurt him
[1:35:06] let her raise him it's okay and solomon
[1:35:08] says okay she's the real mother
[1:35:11] she's the real mother of that baby give
[1:35:12] the baby to her
[1:35:14] amen what wisdom friend but
[1:35:16] understanding is the heart of that
[1:35:17] mother that brought it to that point
[1:35:19] right it was just the wisdom of solomon
[1:35:21] using that love in that mother's heart
[1:35:24] to get that situation solved to realize
[1:35:26] who really was the mother of the child
[1:35:29] even even jocklebed she was
[1:35:32] she was willing to send her child out
[1:35:35] maybe to never see him again
[1:35:38] moses she was willing to let moses go
[1:35:41] out in the
[1:35:42] in the bull rush in the nile river and
[1:35:44] and no telling what might have happened
[1:35:46] to him she'd rather
[1:35:47] have it out there than know that the
[1:35:49] soldiers of pharaoh was coming to kill
[1:35:51] every one of them
[1:35:54] she was willing to live without him for
[1:35:56] the rest of her life
[1:35:59] if she could just know that her boy was
[1:36:02] okay
[1:36:02] right she stood there watched the
[1:36:05] daughter of pharaoh
[1:36:06] draw him out of the water she probably
[1:36:08] thought wow
[1:36:09] he's going to have a good life now going
[1:36:12] to be raised in the
[1:36:13] hollow halls of egypt by the by the
[1:36:16] daughter of the great pharaoh himself
[1:36:17] he'll have a good life now
[1:36:20] little did she know that they were going
[1:36:21] to bring find her and bring moses
[1:36:24] back to be nursed by her i mean that was
[1:36:25] just the best of both worlds then wasn't
[1:36:27] it
[1:36:27] but she didn't know that she just in her
[1:36:30] heart would rather
[1:36:31] live without her baby than to see him
[1:36:34] killed right right
[1:36:35] and that's what you have now of course
[1:36:37] the inspiration of god in
[1:36:39] in bringing that to pass and letting
[1:36:41] that happen the way it happened
[1:36:43] is a huge inspiration it's part of the
[1:36:46] story too
[1:36:47] but that mother she wanted her child to
[1:36:51] live she wanted her child
[1:36:53] happy and she'd rather even see him
[1:36:55] happy than dead
[1:36:57] right and so she took him and maybe
[1:36:59] didn't know she'd ever see him again
[1:37:01] but then god took him and brought him up
[1:37:04] of course we know the rest of the story
[1:37:06] but you see the example even into the
[1:37:08] animal kingdom
[1:37:10] right i'll close here shortly even into
[1:37:13] the animal kingdom
[1:37:16] i i wanted to read these couple of
[1:37:18] stories that brother branham told him
[1:37:20] and we'll close here
[1:37:22] but even in the animal kingdom yeah
[1:37:26] an animal who ha who doesn't have a soul
[1:37:30] but has a spirit but has something in it
[1:37:34] that god given
[1:37:36] to be mother to to to the
[1:37:40] female animals to be a mother
[1:37:43] amen and brother graham talked about the
[1:37:45] that you know in nature
[1:37:47] he would go hunting and uh he'd see
[1:37:50] the bears uh have babies
[1:37:53] the the babies would be born while the
[1:37:55] mother's hibernating
[1:37:56] and she'd wake up and they'd nurse on
[1:37:58] her and she'd wake up and then when the
[1:38:00] babies got old enough she'd run them off
[1:38:03] she brought them off time for you to go
[1:38:05] be your own bearer in your own life
[1:38:07] and she brought them off right he said
[1:38:10] but then
[1:38:11] if her birth the next year didn't take
[1:38:14] she'd go get up one or two of those
[1:38:15] clubs from
[1:38:16] last year she'd try to get them and
[1:38:17] scour them out and bring it back to
[1:38:18] herself and mother them again
[1:38:20] because it was just in her to be a
[1:38:22] mother right that's just what she did
[1:38:25] but you notice how when when they got
[1:38:27] old enough she'd run up she'd just go
[1:38:29] screw them off run them off time for you
[1:38:31] to go have your
[1:38:33] own families and be your own bears
[1:38:36] and then she'd go back and and become
[1:38:38] mother again
[1:38:39] he said he'd see then sometimes that
[1:38:41] their birthday their
[1:38:48] the consummation the uh didn't take
[1:38:51] effect
[1:38:52] and so she didn't have any babies and
[1:38:54] she'd go
[1:38:55] find the last year babies and start
[1:38:57] mothering them again
[1:38:59] amen remember about the possum that that
[1:39:02] that came up to brother brown's
[1:39:03] front door that woman
[1:39:06] that woman that that possum female
[1:39:09] possum drove herself all the way down
[1:39:11] that lane
[1:39:12] and all the way up to his door the woods
[1:39:15] is right across the street
[1:39:16] you've ever been there you said brother
[1:39:18] i'm sure brother cat probably
[1:39:20] been to on ewing lane brother brown's
[1:39:22] old house on ewing lane
[1:39:23] out of the woods is right across the
[1:39:24] street all that possibly thing that
[1:39:26] possum dragging it's her leg
[1:39:28] down gangrene or whatever's eating
[1:39:30] itself up the maggots and stuff
[1:39:32] drug that possum all the way down the
[1:39:34] street and those little nine babies
[1:39:36] sitting in her pouch
[1:39:38] protecting those babies the whole time
[1:39:40] yeah he said
[1:39:41] he and i believe it was uh leo and jean
[1:39:45] was standing there he's talking to him
[1:39:46] and
[1:39:47] he said now look leo gee that's the real
[1:39:49] mother right there
[1:39:51] protecting those babies in her dying
[1:39:54] condition
[1:39:54] yeah of course brother brown god sent
[1:39:57] her over there
[1:39:58] and brother barron eventually prayed for
[1:40:00] her and then possum got well and got up
[1:40:01] and left and ran
[1:40:02] on into the woods across the street
[1:40:04] where it was supposed to go
[1:40:06] but she is protecting her babies the
[1:40:07] whole time watching over them
[1:40:09] keeping them he tells about a story of
[1:40:12] this woman and threw a baby's
[1:40:14] baby into the river or something here
[1:40:16] not long before that
[1:40:18] he said that that that female possum was
[1:40:20] more of a mother than that woman
[1:40:22] that fit that a human woman throwing her
[1:40:25] baby in the river like that
[1:40:27] right that possum was more of a mother
[1:40:29] but one of my favorite stories
[1:40:32] one of my probably greatest that i
[1:40:36] enjoy the most was brother brown talking
[1:40:38] about uh
[1:40:39] his own hut and partner burt
[1:40:43] bert and i've told this story and read
[1:40:45] it several times over the years
[1:40:47] berg was brother branham's friend
[1:40:49] hunting partner
[1:40:51] brother brown talked about bert like he
[1:40:54] was just the low
[1:40:55] downing scoundrel lizard eye person
[1:40:58] everyone i mean
[1:40:59] deceiver uh cruel caught
[1:41:02] he called him cruel at heart yet brother
[1:41:06] brown went hunting with him
[1:41:07] right amen you know i don't know friends
[1:41:11] sometimes we just don't give people a
[1:41:12] chance that's right
[1:41:13] amen sometimes we just kick him to the
[1:41:15] curb before we actually try to witness
[1:41:17] to him
[1:41:18] or try to help him in some way but
[1:41:20] brother aaron tried to witness the birth
[1:41:21] over and over and over again
[1:41:23] tried to help lead burke to jesus christ
[1:41:25] but he wouldn't take it
[1:41:27] but look what happened and and and you
[1:41:30] talk about all this is brother randall
[1:41:31] oh this is the prophet of god this is
[1:41:33] all the miracles and all the souls that
[1:41:35] came in everything that happened his
[1:41:36] ministry and life and all
[1:41:38] but what brought bert to jesus christ
[1:41:42] behold the greater solomon uh greater
[1:41:45] than all of them is here in 1962.
[1:41:48] he said i thought we're fixing to
[1:41:50] separate they're out hunting
[1:41:52] because we getting up pretty high
[1:41:55] there's not much above the timberline so
[1:41:57] we sit down there and reach back like
[1:41:58] this
[1:41:59] and he brought out a little whistle i
[1:42:01] said oh bert don't do that
[1:42:02] he said them lizard eyes looking up at
[1:42:05] me
[1:42:06] just grin like i don't know what he put
[1:42:09] a little whistle in his mouth blew it
[1:42:11] and sounded just like a baby fawn
[1:42:14] you know how he kind of bugles for his
[1:42:17] mama
[1:42:18] when he did that just across the opening
[1:42:20] a great big doe
[1:42:21] stood up a dozen mother deer stood up i
[1:42:24] could see those big brown eyes looking
[1:42:27] around them
[1:42:28] a great big ear sticking up what was it
[1:42:30] she was a mother
[1:42:32] yes she was a mother and her baby had
[1:42:35] called
[1:42:37] he was in trouble she raised up daytime
[1:42:40] or no daytime
[1:42:41] danger or no danger she was a mother
[1:42:44] she was born a mother there's something
[1:42:47] in her like even a little girl playing
[1:42:49] with a little baby doll
[1:42:50] when she's a little girl what is it
[1:42:52] she's born to be a mother
[1:42:54] see it's in her it's by birth she wasn't
[1:42:58] a hypocrite
[1:42:59] she wasn't putting something on she was
[1:43:01] a mother
[1:43:03] bird looked at me with them lizard eyes
[1:43:05] looked up again
[1:43:06] i said don't do it bert he got down like
[1:43:09] that
[1:43:10] he blowed it real easy that mother deer
[1:43:13] walked
[1:43:14] right out into the clearing right out
[1:43:16] into the opening
[1:43:18] he said now that's very unusual
[1:43:20] especially for that time of day a white
[1:43:22] teal
[1:43:22] tail deer certainly been a lot of
[1:43:25] shooting going on
[1:43:26] they wouldn't do that i never seen
[1:43:28] anything like it in my life she walked
[1:43:30] out there right out in that opening he
[1:43:33] said we
[1:43:34] never carry a shell in the barrel you
[1:43:35] know until you're ready
[1:43:38] to shoot so i seen him take this 30 off
[1:43:40] 6 bullet put it in a big 108 grain
[1:43:43] mushroom up there
[1:43:44] he was a dead shot i've seen him level
[1:43:46] down like that and then lizard eyes
[1:43:48] looking through that scope
[1:43:50] do the crosshair when that bolt went
[1:43:52] down
[1:43:53] the deer heard the bolt and she turns
[1:43:56] and bolt makes a click
[1:43:58] when that bolt clicks in that bullet
[1:43:59] clicks in she heard that bolt come down
[1:44:02] and she turned them big ears pointed
[1:44:04] looking at us
[1:44:05] standing there behind the brush
[1:44:09] she saw the hunter but she was a mother
[1:44:13] her baby was in trouble death or no
[1:44:15] death she wanted to get her baby
[1:44:17] i seen that gun level down them quiet
[1:44:20] nerves of that fella i thought old bert
[1:44:22] how can you do it
[1:44:23] one minute from now you'll blow that
[1:44:24] loyal mother's heart right through her
[1:44:26] other side
[1:44:27] so close to he wasn't but about 30 yards
[1:44:30] away
[1:44:31] i thought oh my how could you do it
[1:44:32] bloomer uh blow her heart out like that
[1:44:35] distance to that big bullet i thought
[1:44:37] how can you kill that mother looking for
[1:44:38] her baby
[1:44:39] playing the part of a hypocrite didn't
[1:44:41] get her out in the open like that
[1:44:43] it was her displaying that she was a
[1:44:45] real mother
[1:44:46] die or not her child was in trouble i
[1:44:49] couldn't look at it i turned
[1:44:51] my head looked this way i said oh
[1:44:53] heavenly father don't let him do it
[1:44:55] don't let him do it lord oh how can he
[1:44:56] do it how can there be such
[1:44:58] uh how can he be so cruel as to cure
[1:45:00] that kill that deer like
[1:45:02] that how could he do that that poor
[1:45:04] mother there displaying that loyalty and
[1:45:06] love for her baby
[1:45:08] then he's going to kill her like that
[1:45:09] why don't let him do it lord
[1:45:11] i was just praying within my heart
[1:45:13] waiting to hear the gunfire at any time
[1:45:15] i thought as soon as it fires it's all
[1:45:17] over
[1:45:18] i was standing two or three feet from
[1:45:19] him when he knelt down by that snow
[1:45:21] drift bank
[1:45:22] right over the top of some brush there
[1:45:24] was a brush there was an opening in
[1:45:26] there
[1:45:26] last time i seen him he was holding his
[1:45:28] gun before he brother van turned his
[1:45:30] head he was holding his gun like that
[1:45:31] right at that deer
[1:45:34] quietness i never heard the gunfire
[1:45:38] i thought what's the matter i had my
[1:45:40] back turned like this because i just
[1:45:42] couldn't watch it
[1:45:43] i turned around and looked and the gun
[1:45:45] barrel was shaking like this
[1:45:47] he looked around tears rolling down his
[1:45:50] cheeks he took the gun and thrown it on
[1:45:51] the snow bank
[1:45:52] grabbed me by the pant leg and said
[1:45:54] billy i've had enough of it
[1:45:56] lead me to that jesus that you've been
[1:45:58] talking to me about amen
[1:46:00] amen there on that snow bank knelt down
[1:46:03] by the side there i took by
[1:46:05] took him by the hand led him to jesus
[1:46:08] he's a deacon in the church now
[1:46:10] what is it he saw something real
[1:46:13] something that wasn't put on a real
[1:46:15] mother's love that was calling for her
[1:46:17] baby
[1:46:17] a real mother's love that didn't care
[1:46:20] whether she live or died
[1:46:22] it was her baby she was concerned about
[1:46:24] it was her baby that she was thinking
[1:46:26] about amen and right there that lizard
[1:46:29] eyed bird
[1:46:30] with all the preaching all the
[1:46:32] witnessing with all that brother adam
[1:46:33] can ever do
[1:46:34] to help bert get to jesus christ it was
[1:46:38] done by here
[1:46:39] amen a deer that lizard i'd burp to
[1:46:43] jesus christ
[1:46:44] because he saw something that was real
[1:46:47] he didn't see something put on
[1:46:48] hypocrite you mean a lot of times that
[1:46:51] happens you go and
[1:46:52] i've had people tell me before i don't
[1:46:54] go to church called the hypocrites i
[1:46:56] said you're gonna let hypocrites send
[1:46:57] you to hell
[1:46:57] that doesn't sound like a good bargain
[1:46:59] to me amen but that's what people's had
[1:47:02] that just full of hypocrites
[1:47:04] well you know in some way we probably
[1:47:06] all are
[1:47:07] right in some maybe small my new way
[1:47:11] have you ever done said one thing and
[1:47:13] done something else
[1:47:15] that's hypocrite but
[1:47:18] it wasn't hypocrite she was just a
[1:47:21] mother
[1:47:23] it was just a mother's heart an animal
[1:47:27] someone that doesn't have a soul but a
[1:47:30] spirit
[1:47:31] an animal that was a mother
[1:47:34] and once so concerned about her baby she
[1:47:37] was willing to die for them
[1:47:39] amen this possum willing to die now can
[1:47:42] we just take a lesson can't
[1:47:44] wouldn't it be wonderful the world took
[1:47:46] lessons just from the animal kingdom
[1:47:48] right to have a little morals to have a
[1:47:51] little respect
[1:47:53] to have a little humility amen
[1:47:57] oh friend nothing like that that love of
[1:48:00] a mother
[1:48:01] that reaches out that touches the heart
[1:48:03] of god
[1:48:05] to understand we can take a lesson men
[1:48:08] the fathers all of us of the faith
[1:48:12] that can that that will reach and touch
[1:48:15] the heart of god
[1:48:16] nothing or do it like a mother's love
[1:48:19] amen nothing can do it like a mother's
[1:48:21] love
[1:48:21] as much as i could pray hold my kids
[1:48:24] before the lord which i do
[1:48:25] still do and all of you nothing like a
[1:48:29] mother's life
[1:48:30] there isn't and never will be because
[1:48:32] they're built that way that's the way
[1:48:34] god made it
[1:48:35] amen and there's something that goes out
[1:48:39] and and reaches god in a way that
[1:48:41] nothing else can
[1:48:43] i'm thankful for my godly mother amen
[1:48:46] if you've had a godly mother if you got
[1:48:49] an opportunity to thank her
[1:48:52] verbally today please do it if you have
[1:48:54] an opportunity to call her
[1:48:56] please do it if you have a
[1:49:00] a mother that isn't that wasn't
[1:49:01] necessarily a godly mother
[1:49:03] call her anyway yes and thank her for
[1:49:06] being your mother
[1:49:08] yes amen said well she wasn't much of a
[1:49:10] mother
[1:49:12] maybe she was maybe she did the best she
[1:49:14] could
[1:49:15] we don't know amen but thank him today
[1:49:20] amen i believe my mother's here and i
[1:49:22] thank her i wish i could call her i wish
[1:49:24] i could go see her talk to her verbally
[1:49:26] again
[1:49:26] but not on this side right i'll see her
[1:49:29] again
[1:49:30] amen but i thank god for
[1:49:34] and they seem to be becoming fewer and
[1:49:36] fewer but
[1:49:37] a good godly mother that'll raise their
[1:49:40] children in the nurture and admonition
[1:49:42] of god
[1:49:43] she won't let the world raise them she
[1:49:46] won't let some tv or some video game
[1:49:48] raise them she'll raise them herself
[1:49:50] yeah she'll bring in his heart friend
[1:49:54] if you're a mother i'm i'm i'm uh i'm
[1:49:57] out of place here
[1:49:59] but there's there's probably no harder
[1:50:01] job in the world
[1:50:02] and none with any greater responsibility
[1:50:05] than what a mother's
[1:50:06] shoulders just you said well it doesn't
[1:50:10] look like fixed and physically demanding
[1:50:12] there's so much pressure so much
[1:50:15] spiritual
[1:50:16] uh responsibility that falls on that
[1:50:20] mother
[1:50:21] because she really desires to see her
[1:50:24] children grow
[1:50:25] and and be raised in the nurture and
[1:50:27] admonition of god and wants to do what's
[1:50:29] right
[1:50:30] that's always there
[1:50:33] hardest job i thank god for my wife
[1:50:37] amen who raised our children and was a
[1:50:39] godly mother to them
[1:50:41] yes we were talking the other day and we
[1:50:43] said you know
[1:50:47] our children didn't always do everything
[1:50:48] right
[1:50:50] but i didn't ever always do everything
[1:50:51] right either neither did my wife
[1:50:55] i don't know that anybody always does
[1:50:57] everything right
[1:50:59] but we said we we took them to church
[1:51:01] when the doors were open
[1:51:02] our children were in church that's right
[1:51:04] we were there with them
[1:51:07] camp meetings tent meetings special
[1:51:10] revivals
[1:51:11] services virginia west virginia south
[1:51:15] carolina georgia florida
[1:51:17] north carolina wherever it was they were
[1:51:19] in church indoor outdoors amen
[1:51:21] indoor outdoor wherever it was sometimes
[1:51:24] we had
[1:51:25] service and there was no tent it was
[1:51:27] just in the middle of a field
[1:51:30] but they were there they were in church
[1:51:33] amen raised them that way
[1:51:35] amen church don't save them we know that
[1:51:38] amen
[1:51:38] but when you train a child the way that
[1:51:40] you go it will not depart from them
[1:51:43] right amen praise the lord god bless you
[1:51:46] mother

[1:54:38] just continue to pray for that if you
[1:54:39] would also as i text you during the week
[1:54:42] i found out um monday that the general
[1:54:45] manager of the
[1:54:46] the hotel here will allow us to have the
[1:54:49] room next door next sunday
[1:54:51] so after service which we're going to

[1:54:57] to 3 o'clock we'll have the room next
[1:54:59] door
[1:55:00] um for a dinner because saturday

[1:55:21] i see the room every time we leave it's
[1:55:23] always empty it's big it's clean and
[1:55:25] tables chairs and he said sure he didn't
[1:55:28] even charge us anything for it either
