[34:55] sent a letter on the it was David the
[34:57] 10th I'm not sure when he sent it but um
[35:01] I didn't get the letter I didn't open it
[35:04] I didn't go in my mailbox until today I
[35:07] didn't
[35:09] go last week at the beginning so he's
[35:13] what and he needs he said please pray
[35:15] for me on January
[35:19] 16th and this is the 28 right and um and
[35:24] so I he said please fast and pray for me
[35:28] because I need
[35:30] deliverance and so I am even though it's
[35:35] the 16th I've learned God's time is not
[35:38] like our time and that I've been able to
[35:41] successfully ask prayers retroactive to
[35:44] the
[35:45] event because God knows the beginning
[35:48] amen and so I know that we can pray for
[35:51] him amen well the fact of his faith in
[35:55] writing the note to start with
[35:57] site brother Ram's said it's on your
[35:59] faith so the faith the fact that he had
[36:01] the faith to write that uh the Lord will
[36:04] honor that praise the Lord even if you
[36:06] weren't able to get the letter opened
[36:08] before then God knows and that's what
[36:10] matters he's asking for the Holy
[36:13] Ghost apparently he had a sanctifying
[36:16] experience before he doesn't believe he
[36:18] has the Holy Ghost so he's asking theost
[36:21] amen praise the Lord that's remember him

[37:53] your presence is here this morning thank
[37:56] you Lord help us to recognize the day
[38:00] and the hour that we're living in Lord
[38:02] there's so much that's fighting us from
[38:06] illnesses to uh depression and
[38:10] mental disabilities and so many things
[38:14] father the enemy is throwing at us J and
[38:18] father you have given us an advocate you
[38:22] have given us uh armor that we have
[38:27] on at all times to recognize the devil
[38:31] in all his tricks oh Father without you
[38:35] we'll surely fail without you we are
[38:39] nothing and father help us to be humble
[38:43] and to be in a place like that uh
[38:48] Publican that went into the temple to
[38:50] pray he couldn't even lift up his head
[38:54] he says Lord forgive such sin ey amen
[38:58] and Lord we know you don't use the proud
[39:01] there's some that think well I got this
[39:04] ability and I got this uh um strength
[39:09] Lord you cannot use it oh Jesus perfect
[39:12] strength is made by Perfect weakness as
[39:14] our Prophet taught us and Lord we as
[39:18] that young man our sister shared that is
[39:22] crying out for the Holy Ghost may you go
[39:25] on a scene and Grant him that heart's
[39:29] desire and there are some here I believe
[39:32] that might have that same desire if
[39:35] there's something in our lives that
[39:38] we're still longing for the things of
[39:40] the world it's time to repent and get
[39:44] right with you father oh God help oh
[39:47] Lord you showed a prophet the bride in
[39:51] preview and the last part of that Vision
[39:54] the true bride was getting out of Step
[39:58] Lord that's that bride that refuses to
[40:02] obey your word in his fullness any
[40:05] little excuse they stop praying any
[40:09] little excuse they don't go to church
[40:12] any little excuse they feel that they
[40:15] don't have to love this one because he
[40:19] doesn't love them back oh Lord help us
[40:22] to
[40:23] recognize that we need to have that
[40:26] token UND displayed yes Lord we need to
[40:29] have your Holy Spirit totally in control
[40:33] ourselves out of the way dead to self as
[40:36] brother Brown said a dead man doesn't
[40:39] have any rights and Lord that's the only
[40:42] way you can work through your bride we
[40:44] need to die to ourselves even as we pray
[40:48] and present these request of different
[40:51] ones that need healing we know to truly
[40:55] reach your your throne we need to have
[40:58] compassion Lord as the prophet said as
[41:01] we live for others we look heaven in the

[57:29] I minister to India every other week by
[57:32] Zoom save Zone airfare and
[57:36] uh I've been I've been starting a
[57:38] different series with the ones that are
[57:40] down there and here it would be a
[57:44] two-part um anyway I thought I'd
[57:47] forewarn you so if you don't like today
[57:49] don't bother coming back we while you're
[57:53] standing if you open your Bible Bibles
[57:55] to to John 1 read verses 1
[57:59] through3 and the concentration on
[58:02] today's message is who just who is Jesus
[58:05] Christ he mentioned him about different
[58:08] things but but you know I've been doing
[58:11] some studying recently and brother B
[58:13] made a comment I'll get into that
[58:15] later but it open it broadened my it
[58:19] made me think in in different ways if
[58:21] you will so in in it says in John 1
[58:24] starting at verse one it says in the
[58:25] beginning was the word the word was with
[58:28] God and the Word was God the same was in
[58:31] the beginning with God and all things
[58:32] were made by him without him was not
[58:35] anything made that was made amen and
[58:38] let's just
[58:40] pray our most gracious and loving
[58:42] Heavenly Father it is always our
[58:44] privilege to be able to come together as
[58:46] part of the body of Jesus Christ and
[58:49] then Lord to take and open up the pages
[58:51] of your word and read from it something
[58:53] which is written many years ago but Lord
[58:57] the revelation of what we just read is
[58:59] becoming greater and greater in this
[59:01] generation because Lord in this
[59:03] generation all things are to come to
[59:05] fulfillment amen yes so take me Lord as
[59:07] your servant this morning and use me and
[59:10] help me Lord to to express to the people
[59:13] through you through your anointing
[59:14] through your presence the different
[59:16] things Lord that I've been studying so
[59:18] Lord we might understand who we are yes
[59:21] Lord because lordless we understand who
[59:23] you are will never understand who we are
[59:26] yes Lord so bless us Lord through your
[59:28] word thank you Jesus I ask it in Jesus
[59:30] Christ's name amen amen you can be
[59:35] seated and God's power to transform he
[59:37] makes a
[59:39] statement Jesus Christ was God himself
[59:42] manifested because he was a Son of God
[59:45] because he because he was begotten but
[59:48] it was just a tabernacle for him to live
[59:52] in amen no man is seen God at any time
[59:55] but the only begotten of the father has
[59:56] declared him and this was the thing that
[59:59] struck out to me he said God built
[1:00:00] himself a house a body to live in to
[1:00:04] come down so we could touch him amen but
[1:00:08] we are now this
[1:00:10] Tabernacle and this is this is what
[1:00:13] anyway this this is what what brought me
[1:00:15] into thinking the way that we're doing
[1:00:18] right when we when begin to understand
[1:00:20] when we think of Jesus Christ here's a
[1:00:22] man who lived 2,000 years ago good man
[1:00:25] Prophet nice man he went about doing
[1:00:27] good he healed sick raised the dead did
[1:00:29] all kinds of nice wonderful things and
[1:00:31] then and then in the process of time he
[1:00:34] hung on a cross and he died for my sins
[1:00:37] how was 2,000 years ago okay that's nice
[1:00:41] and some people still have them 2,000
[1:00:43] years ago sure Christmas what did they
[1:00:45] do yes oh isn't this a cute little baby
[1:00:47] oh isn't this a cute adorable little
[1:00:49] baby amen and then when he get to e oh
[1:00:52] it was so sad for him to that cute
[1:00:53] little baby to grow up and to have to
[1:00:55] hang on a cross so that I could be
[1:00:58] redeemed and that's where people put him
[1:01:01] yeah that's all it is to him but what it
[1:01:04] talks about in him was in in the
[1:01:06] beginning was the word when I think of
[1:01:09] the word I think of letters on a piece
[1:01:11] of page yeah okay I mean that that's
[1:01:14] that's just my mentality I was raised in
[1:01:16] a Baptist Church went to Assemblies of
[1:01:17] God's church and so here again
[1:01:19] trinitarian
[1:01:20] background and so when I began to read
[1:01:22] in this I began to think what was Jesus
[1:01:25] Christ the Bible says in the beginning
[1:01:27] was the word well the word when
[1:01:29] translator means the logos right and so
[1:01:32] to me the logos has an entirely
[1:01:34] different
[1:01:35] connotation when I think of the logos
[1:01:37] the logos is is is is everything that
[1:01:40] God is right manifested yeah he he was a
[1:01:44] complete expression of God he was a
[1:01:46] complete manifestation of God he was God
[1:01:48] in in every in every aspect amen and
[1:01:52] when I begin to look at them we see oh
[1:01:53] the Holy Spirit dwells in me third part
[1:01:55] of the Trinity no no the logos dwells in
[1:01:59] me amen and to me that has a different
[1:02:02] connotation absolutely because all of a
[1:02:04] sudden I begin to think of something
[1:02:05] else no it's it's it's this entity which
[1:02:08] we call God it's this eternal Supreme
[1:02:10] alls sufficient self-existing one that
[1:02:13] is what I have in me amen and that is
[1:02:16] what is leading and guiding my life it
[1:02:19] that is what I have access to because I
[1:02:22] am a son of that of that eternal spirit
[1:02:24] yes praise the Lord and so this is where
[1:02:26] my thoughts began to go and this is
[1:02:28] anyway this is this is what I began to
[1:02:30] to think about this this is where the
[1:02:32] sermons were
[1:02:33] developed so it say it's it's so God
[1:02:37] manifested himself in different forms as
[1:02:40] we go through the Bible we we go and we
[1:02:42] begin to realize God is a spirit a
[1:02:45] spirit has no form in order for that
[1:02:47] Spirit to manifest itself it has to take
[1:02:49] on a physical manifestation amen you
[1:02:52] don't see me because in me I am Spirit
[1:02:54] also sure but my body declares who I
[1:02:58] am okay you're all you also we don't see
[1:03:01] you we see the Tabernacle you dwell in
[1:03:04] amen and you because of your spirit
[1:03:07] because that's what dwells inside of you
[1:03:09] your body expresses who you are your
[1:03:12] body your body your spirit all of a
[1:03:14] sudden controls you and through and
[1:03:16] through the body that you live in all of
[1:03:18] a sudden that is where we that is how we
[1:03:20] understand who you are that is how we
[1:03:22] look upon you that is how we interact
[1:03:23] with you and and so here again we have
[1:03:25] to understand God is a spirit that
[1:03:28] spirit that Lo that Spirit formed itself
[1:03:31] Al
[1:03:32] Loos that logos came and began to begin
[1:03:35] the physical creation that physical
[1:03:38] creation God needed because God want to
[1:03:40] Fellowship his children Amen in spirit
[1:03:43] form we be one Spirit floating here and
[1:03:45] one Spirit floating here and one Spirit
[1:03:47] floating here but when we read about
[1:03:49] what brother bradam said when he went
[1:03:50] beyond the curtain of time what did he
[1:03:51] do those were real people yes
[1:03:54] their physical form the same form they
[1:03:56] had on Earth the only difference was is
[1:03:58] they no longer old and decrepit and
[1:04:01] whatever else that thing might happened
[1:04:03] no they were young again amen they were
[1:04:05] in their Prime of their life because
[1:04:07] brother B says God took a picture of you
[1:04:09] in your Prime and that's the picture
[1:04:12] that's going to come into development
[1:04:13] when we when we cross over to the other
[1:04:15] side and when we come back in glorified
[1:04:17] bodies that is the picture that'll be
[1:04:19] fully developed we will live in those
[1:04:22] bodies we will dwell in those bodies we
[1:04:23] will interact with each other in those
[1:04:25] bodies in those glorified bodies amen
[1:04:27] and I'm looking for this change yes
[1:04:29] right yes I'm getting this this one's
[1:04:31] kind of getting older and has its issues
[1:04:34] yeah but here again but but this is this
[1:04:36] is where we're coming to this is what
[1:04:38] we're going to and and and if we don't
[1:04:41] understand what Jesus Christ is if we
[1:04:44] think of him as a second person of a
[1:04:45] trinity something that lived 2,000 years
[1:04:48] ago that doesn't do me any good right if
[1:04:51] I have the a part of God as the holy SP
[1:04:54] Spirit dwelling in me but where's the
[1:04:56] other 2/3 yeah that doesn't do me any
[1:04:59] good any good either in my my my
[1:05:01] thinking when I realize it's the logos
[1:05:05] it's God himself all the very essence of
[1:05:08] everything God is that is what dwells
[1:05:11] inside of me praise the Lord and because
[1:05:13] that is what dwells inside of me
[1:05:15] somebody asked Brother Brad when all of
[1:05:17] a sudden he got Revelation to the
[1:05:18] godhead he asked well brother Brown who
[1:05:20] do I pray to do I pray you know because
[1:05:22] I used to pray to the father and I
[1:05:24] didn't want to offend the son so I
[1:05:25] prayed to him a little bit also and then
[1:05:27] every now and then I would inject the
[1:05:29] Holy Spirit and this because I you know
[1:05:30] I I didn't want any of them to get mad
[1:05:32] at me you know and all of a sudden he
[1:05:34] began to realize no God is a single
[1:05:36] entity God is God Amen so he says well
[1:05:39] who do you pray to you pray to the god
[1:05:41] that's in you amen amen because that's
[1:05:44] where God dwells amen all that God was
[1:05:47] he poured into Jesus Christ everything
[1:05:49] that was in Jesus Christ he is poured
[1:05:51] into his church amen and you look on the
[1:05:53] day of Pentecost what happened that
[1:05:54] logos came and separated itself out the
[1:05:57] pillar of fire separated itself out and
[1:05:59] began to dwell in every one of the
[1:06:00] Believers well that is what dwells in US
[1:06:04] it isn't a third person of a trinity
[1:06:05] it's God himself the very essence of
[1:06:07] everything that God is amen that is what
[1:06:10] dwells within us praise the
[1:06:14] Lord and and who is this he says so
[1:06:18] first so so he was first god Jehovah see
[1:06:22] then let's see him coming out of pH
[1:06:24] there's nothing there uh he said let's
[1:06:27] make it a little white light like a
[1:06:28] Mystic light like a Halo and that was
[1:06:30] the logos that went out of God in the
[1:06:33] beginning that was what and that was
[1:06:36] what was in the beginning was the word
[1:06:38] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:06:39] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:06:40] dwelt Among Us he said in the beginning
[1:06:42] was God and then God and then out of God
[1:06:46] came the logos a part of God that went
[1:06:48] out of God yes but here have understand
[1:06:52] that when God God came and had to dwell
[1:06:55] within that thing that being that God
[1:06:58] had to come and dwell in the in the
[1:06:59] physical form that the logos
[1:07:03] was because God is a spirit when we get
[1:07:06] down a little bit further we find out
[1:07:08] what brother Bram says he says there is
[1:07:09] see like a little child playing before
[1:07:11] the door that logos was everything God
[1:07:15] was but that logos had to learn to
[1:07:17] submit to the God that was in it that it
[1:07:20] was a part of yeah well see this now
[1:07:23] comes down unto us we have to learn to
[1:07:26] submit to the god that dwells in US amen
[1:07:29] that logos dwells in us and what's he
[1:07:31] trying to do he's trying to he's trying
[1:07:33] to have the preeminence in our lives so
[1:07:35] that he can express himself through US
[1:07:38] amen yes everything God did in Jesus
[1:07:40] Christ he wants to do in you yes the
[1:07:43] only way the only limitation is the fact
[1:07:45] is we don't believe
[1:07:47] it we refuse to be acknowledge the fact
[1:07:50] that that God dwells inside of me and I
[1:07:52] I will listen to that God and and and I
[1:07:54] will allow that God to dwell in in in me
[1:07:57] and speak through me that God can do
[1:07:59] through me everything that he's wanting
[1:08:00] to accomplish amen when you look at
[1:08:02] Jesus Christ he only did as the father
[1:08:04] showed him yeah right well this is where
[1:08:08] we have to come in our lives sometimes
[1:08:11] we're going someplace and all of a
[1:08:12] sudden God inspires us and we just speak
[1:08:14] something to
[1:08:16] somebody well that happened my opinion
[1:08:19] that happens to be God speaking sure God
[1:08:21] wanted to use my voice to speak to
[1:08:23] another part of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] amen and so I was just sitting there and
[1:08:27] I opened my all of a sudden I fell that
[1:08:29] I opened my mouth and what came out I
[1:08:31] believe that was God and later on I
[1:08:34] found out well that was ministering to
[1:08:35] that lady's need sure in other times
[1:08:38] it's the same but also in your
[1:08:41] lives it isn't just ministers amen
[1:08:44] ministers have their place because God
[1:08:46] placed Ministry within the church so
[1:08:48] that God through that Ministry could
[1:08:50] minister to himself in the body yes but
[1:08:53] every one of us is
[1:08:55] equal right every one of us is the same
[1:08:58] you don't have to call your pastor to
[1:08:59] have prayer for something you do it sure
[1:09:02] we are Kings and Priests amen the same
[1:09:04] God that dwells in him dwells in you and
[1:09:07] all you have to do is allow the god that
[1:09:09] dwells in you to use you to minister to
[1:09:12] each other
[1:09:14] yes amen very true
[1:09:19] amen so brother Brown in in in in in the
[1:09:22] sermon who was
[1:09:24] God he go goes on and he says here is he
[1:09:27] says see it's just like a child playing
[1:09:29] before the door it it was the Son of God
[1:09:31] the Loos and I can see him out here and
[1:09:34] he spake and said let there be light
[1:09:36] there was nothing but there was
[1:09:38] something happened and Adam turned here
[1:09:40] and began to whirl around this way and
[1:09:42] that way he said where did where did he
[1:09:44] make it from he says I don't know there
[1:09:47] was nothing to make it from but he
[1:09:49] believed his own word yes and there came
[1:09:54] to life right the logos had to believe
[1:09:58] the God that was in
[1:10:01] it he had to believe that what the God
[1:10:03] in it was speaking through it and
[1:10:06] believe that what was coming out of his
[1:10:08] out of his mouth if that's that's part I
[1:10:12] I don't haven't seen the logos I have
[1:10:13] cou but here again but he
[1:10:16] spoke once that word went out that
[1:10:18] word's creative amen and because that
[1:10:21] word is creative he said let there be
[1:10:22] light light came yes it had to come
[1:10:26] because the God that was in the logos
[1:10:28] the God that was a part of that logos or
[1:10:30] the logos was a part of God that word
[1:10:32] which went forth it was creative and it
[1:10:34] had to come to pass it's like it says a
[1:10:37] virgin shall
[1:10:38] conceive okay I forget how many hundred
[1:10:41] of year later that word once it was
[1:10:44] spoken had to find a resting place yes
[1:10:46] it found a resting place in Mary right
[1:10:49] and so that that the word that was
[1:10:50] spoken all of a sudden it found in Mary
[1:10:52] the resting place and that created
[1:10:54] within Mary the seed which eventually
[1:10:56] would produce the body we call Jesus
[1:10:58] Christ
[1:11:02] amen in conference with god brother Bram
[1:11:05] says we got to come to the word that's
[1:11:07] the only he says and that is God in the
[1:11:10] beginning was the word the logos and the
[1:11:11] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:11:14] and then he goes on here and he and and
[1:11:16] he goes on he say he and he said see God
[1:11:19] made man when he began to brood over the
[1:11:21] Earth up come like Easter FL flowers or
[1:11:24] upcome grass or some other species
[1:11:25] Rising higher and higher the great Holy
[1:11:28] Spirit brooding or or brooding means to
[1:11:31] to to mothering over cing he says and
[1:11:34] the flowers come up and the father said
[1:11:36] that's wonderful just keep it up and so
[1:11:39] to me it looks like there's almost for
[1:11:41] lack of a better word there was a
[1:11:43] training period for this logos to be
[1:11:46] able to manifest and to do what God
[1:11:48] intended to do through that logos yes he
[1:11:50] said the father said that's wonderful
[1:11:52] just keep it up and are brooded and
[1:11:54] after a while out come the birds and the
[1:11:56] next things come animals and finally the
[1:11:58] Earth reflected the reflection of
[1:12:00] himself that was brooding and that was
[1:12:02] God and he Adam was in the image of God
[1:12:05] and never did anything come higher than
[1:12:07] a
[1:12:09] man and man even to our beloved sisters
[1:12:12] a woman she is not in the original
[1:12:14] creation he say she's the byproduct of a
[1:12:16] man a part of
[1:12:18] him and in the same way we have to
[1:12:20] realize we as the bride of Christ
[1:12:24] we are a part of him amen I mean this is
[1:12:26] the type in the shadows when you go back
[1:12:28] and look in the Garden of Eden when Adam
[1:12:30] was created he when Adam was created
[1:12:32] male and female he was created and then
[1:12:36] God took part of God made a body for
[1:12:38] Adam to live in but but Adam was lonely
[1:12:41] so God took a part of Adam and he made
[1:12:43] another body and he led the other the
[1:12:45] other part of Adam to now come and dwell
[1:12:47] within the human body and so and so now
[1:12:49] Adam was complete yes Adam was never
[1:12:53] complete without Eve Christ is never
[1:12:56] complete without his bride because we
[1:12:58] are the other part of his body amen and
[1:13:00] we are supposed to manifest what he is
[1:13:05] yesen and he goes on to say and they are
[1:13:08] one in Christ oh yeah it's a great
[1:13:10] lesson we could go on with that and it
[1:13:12] goes on in Revelations 4:11 Thou Art
[1:13:14] Worthy of God to receive glory and honor
[1:13:16] and power for thou H has created all
[1:13:18] things and for thy pleasure they are
[1:13:20] created praise the Lord yes why did God
[1:13:24] create
[1:13:26] Satan why would he create his own enemy
[1:13:30] right if you have a business why would
[1:13:32] you hire somebody who was set out to
[1:13:34] destroy your business it's true I mean
[1:13:37] that makes no sense but God had
[1:13:40] attributes he wanted to express yes
[1:13:43] there had to be sickness so he could
[1:13:44] prove he was a Healer there there had to
[1:13:46] be there had to be things had something
[1:13:49] had to be lost in order for him to
[1:13:50] manifest himself as the Redeemer there
[1:13:52] had to be other other things that happen
[1:13:54] within the world and and the only reason
[1:13:56] they came is because of Satan right why
[1:13:59] do you get sick Satan attacks you right
[1:14:01] what does he attack he attacks your body
[1:14:04] amen what does God say I am your healer
[1:14:06] I've already he healed you I've already
[1:14:07] paid the price prise the Lord Stripes
[1:14:09] laid up right back was for your healing
[1:14:11] and if you can accept it you're healed
[1:14:13] it doesn't matter the symptoms it looks
[1:14:16] at the promise prise and the more we
[1:14:18] concentrate on the promise the more we
[1:14:20] can access that and the more we can
[1:14:21] believe and the more God will be able to
[1:14:23] do that through US
[1:14:26] Amen in Colossians 1:16 for by him were
[1:14:30] all things created that are in heaven
[1:14:32] that are on earth visible and invisible
[1:14:34] whether it be Thrones or dominions or
[1:14:35] principalities or power all things were
[1:14:37] created by Him and for him and he is
[1:14:39] before all things and by him all things
[1:14:42] consist and he's the head of the body
[1:14:44] the church who in the beginning who is
[1:14:47] the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:14:49] dead that in all things he might have
[1:14:51] the
[1:14:52] preeminence so we are we are his body he
[1:14:57] is to be the head yes the head takes you
[1:15:00] the body the body takes instructions
[1:15:02] from the
[1:15:03] head I mean when I when I walk my body
[1:15:06] has to send all the signals down and
[1:15:08] coordinate my walking and like you know
[1:15:10] and all of a sudden it decides not to
[1:15:12] then I Stumble and I fall okay the older
[1:15:14] you get the circus no longer work like
[1:15:17] they used to but anyway yeah but we have
[1:15:20] to begin to understand he is the head
[1:15:22] yes and everything is to take command
[1:15:25] from him it isn't us doing what we want
[1:15:29] right it's us obeying him amen and the
[1:15:33] more we will listen to him and the more
[1:15:35] we will obey him then the more of
[1:15:37] himself it can be expressed through US
[1:15:39] yes okay
[1:15:41] amen when we look at Jesus Christ he
[1:15:43] says I do only what the father shows
[1:15:46] me okay in fact one place he says it
[1:15:49] isn't me who does the work it's the
[1:15:51] father who dwells in me amen
[1:15:53] okay when you listening to brother Bram
[1:15:55] there's another place and I don't have
[1:15:56] the notes right in front of me but he
[1:15:58] said I was just standing there when the
[1:16:00] you know when the pillar of fire came
[1:16:01] down at the Ohio River he says I was
[1:16:04] just standing there and all of a sudden
[1:16:06] God wanted to use my voice and that's
[1:16:08] when the discernment and stuff yes and
[1:16:10] there are other times when the squirrels
[1:16:12] God says create them speak it right yeah
[1:16:16] okay so he did one and oh wow hey that's
[1:16:19] great the angel says I thought you said
[1:16:21] you needed three yes
[1:16:24] well yeah I did well where's the second
[1:16:26] one coming from okay and he said I'm
[1:16:29] going to go around here and go over
[1:16:30] there okay but I mean here again God
[1:16:33] gave him the permission to speak yes it
[1:16:37] wasn't him speaking because he wanted I
[1:16:41] mean I couldn't go out here and say I
[1:16:42] want a new Ferrari you know I don't
[1:16:45] think that would happen yeah because I
[1:16:47] don't think that's God's will right but
[1:16:49] yet there are other times and all of a
[1:16:51] sudden somebody else has a need and and
[1:16:53] so all of a sudden the anointing comes
[1:16:54] upon us and all of a sudden we pray for
[1:16:57] somebody and we give you your healing in
[1:16:58] the name of Jesus Christ amen and then
[1:17:01] God
[1:17:02] heals but here again it's God anointing
[1:17:05] it's God directing it's God using my
[1:17:08] voice to speak whatever it is he's
[1:17:09] wanting spoken
[1:17:12] amen we know that God we know that God
[1:17:16] appeared in different forms and
[1:17:18] different places in the Bible and so the
[1:17:21] voice of God was walking in the garden
[1:17:25] okay in what form I don't know but it
[1:17:28] says you know God came God God God
[1:17:31] appeared to Adam and Eve he appeared to
[1:17:33] Noah he appeared to different ones what
[1:17:35] form it doesn't tell us yeah but we know
[1:17:38] that there was a time
[1:17:40] when um when Abraham went to rescue lot
[1:17:45] and after the battle he was coming back
[1:17:47] through
[1:17:47] Jerusalem he met madc yeah melkisedek
[1:17:52] was a body form of theophany that that
[1:17:54] logos now took upon itself it cre it
[1:17:57] Formed that body called mezc and it sat
[1:18:00] there and it gave it gave um it gave
[1:18:04] Abram you know some food I think wine
[1:18:07] and
[1:18:09] bread okay but so God took on that form
[1:18:13] there but then when God was done with
[1:18:16] that
[1:18:16] formof away it went there was another
[1:18:20] time when all when God wanted to come
[1:18:22] and talk to ABRA to
[1:18:24] Abram and all of a sudden so he says you
[1:18:26] know because they were going to
[1:18:27] investigate what was going on in Sodom
[1:18:29] and
[1:18:30] Gomorrah why he had to do that I mean
[1:18:33] God's all knowing so anyway but God came
[1:18:36] and he appeared to Abram Abraham at that
[1:18:39] point in time and sat down and and that
[1:18:42] body ate it drank it it was a it was a
[1:18:46] physical form it had dust on its
[1:18:48] feet and then when when Sarah laughed it
[1:18:51] discerned what Sarah was Sarah had in
[1:18:53] her mind right and brother Brown so the
[1:18:56] way that God appeared to Abraham then is
[1:18:58] the same way that God is appearing to us
[1:19:00] now that's why the discernment that's
[1:19:02] that's why what we see in brother bram's
[1:19:04] life that was the Fulfillment of that
[1:19:06] title right amen but here again but God
[1:19:10] God appeared to Abram and there he ate
[1:19:12] and he drank and he began to tell
[1:19:13] Abraham he said you're going to have a
[1:19:15] child by
[1:19:16] Sarah okay the word became spoken yes
[1:19:21] year later all of a sudden they were
[1:19:24] they were holding holding Isaac amen
[1:19:27] okay we also know that there was a time
[1:19:30] when when uh they had invited the
[1:19:33] promised land and all of a sudden Joshua
[1:19:36] went out there and he began to overlook
[1:19:38] the city and well how do we going to do
[1:19:40] this it's nice strong wall strong Gates
[1:19:43] Strong this strong that and all of a
[1:19:46] sudden he send a presence of someone
[1:19:47] else and he pulled out a sword says who
[1:19:49] are you are you for us or for the enemy
[1:19:52] he saysi I'm the captain of the host
[1:19:55] I've come to make sure that my will is
[1:19:57] fulfilled yes I want you to do exactly
[1:19:59] what I tell you amen amen yes
[1:20:02] sir so so Joshua goes back and say
[1:20:06] everybody asked what's the plan what's
[1:20:07] the plan well we don't want to disturb
[1:20:10] the neighbors so have a nice breakfast
[1:20:12] we'll get up we kind quietly walk around
[1:20:15] the city come back have a nice lunch and
[1:20:18] rest
[1:20:20] relax um even in the sun too long
[1:20:24] well yeah we're going to do that for six
[1:20:25] days and you know but the seventh day
[1:20:28] we're going to walk around seven times
[1:20:31] then you're going to shout yes then we
[1:20:33] have the city amen but that in in in in
[1:20:36] Medic in in in military terms that's
[1:20:39] that's crazy yeah but that's what God
[1:20:42] told Joshua to do
[1:20:45] amen some of the times God tells us to
[1:20:48] do something that's
[1:20:50] crazy but that's God's will amen that's
[1:20:54] the way God wants it done sure and so as
[1:20:57] long as we obey what he wants done then
[1:21:00] it gets fulfilled what his will is and
[1:21:03] all the reason that we are our existence
[1:21:05] here is we are here to do the Willing of
[1:21:07] God we are here to be his body upon this
[1:21:09] Earth we are his hands we're his feet
[1:21:11] we're his eyes ears nose and mouth if
[1:21:13] God wants to go someplace we have to
[1:21:15] carry him because he's in US yes
[1:21:18] sometimes we'll drive because walking to
[1:21:20] Phoenix is hard you know so we drive
[1:21:22] right but I mean but here again you have
[1:21:24] to understand we carry God and then when
[1:21:28] God wants to minister to somebody he he
[1:21:30] has he wants to use his body amen
[1:21:33] because it's it's through his body that
[1:21:35] he wants to work but we have to be
[1:21:38] willing to allow him
[1:21:44] Amen in order for in order for us to be
[1:21:48] redeemed God in melkisedek could not die
[1:21:52] and redeem us because he was a theophany
[1:21:55] form yeah God and the one that appeared
[1:21:58] in Joshua could not die for us amen
[1:22:00] because he was theop for right God and
[1:22:03] the one that appeared to Moses and had
[1:22:05] Moses hide in the
[1:22:07] Rock um here again that form could not
[1:22:10] die for us because it had to become us
[1:22:14] amen he God literally had to take on the
[1:22:17] same flesh that we take on right and so
[1:22:21] God came in the form of Jesus Jesus
[1:22:23] Christ it says in what in Isaiah 9:6 For
[1:22:26] unto us as a child is born unto us a son
[1:22:29] is given and the government shall be
[1:22:30] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:22:33] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:22:35] God the Everlasting father the of peace
[1:22:37] that was that baby yes when he was born
[1:22:40] he was the son of God when he was born
[1:22:43] he was God now dwelling in a in a body
[1:22:46] of of of of a baby and that body had to
[1:22:49] grow and that body had to become
[1:22:51] stronger
[1:22:53] in sman church age brother B goes on he
[1:22:56] says he says I will give you a sign and
[1:22:58] a virgin shall be with child and the
[1:23:00] Virgin shall conceive and bear done and
[1:23:02] best bear a son and God came down in a
[1:23:05] blood cell not through a man but by the
[1:23:08] Holy Ghost and in the Virgin womb a
[1:23:09] tabernacle for the purpose of death was
[1:23:12] built the seed of the woman came in
[1:23:14] order that he that he be that he might
[1:23:19] bruise the seed of the woman came in
[1:23:21] order that he be bruised to bring us our
[1:23:24] Salvation yes the cell was created in
[1:23:27] the beginning of the creation of God and
[1:23:29] that is who Jesus is and that is what
[1:23:32] what we'll get into that but that is
[1:23:33] what Jesus Christ he's what is he what
[1:23:35] is he creating today right he's creating
[1:23:38] our bodies amen he's creating himself in
[1:23:41] US amen and this is what we have to
[1:23:44] realize Hallelujah see when that
[1:23:47] acceptable sacrifice rose out of the
[1:23:49] water God came and indwelt him
[1:23:51] fulfilling filling him with the spirit
[1:23:53] without measure okay that's when he
[1:23:55] became the Messiah yes in the exposition
[1:23:58] of the seven Church ages brother Bram
[1:24:00] goes on and says the beginning of the
[1:24:02] creation of God he said get get the
[1:24:05] people get the idea that Jesus was the
[1:24:07] first creation of God making him lower
[1:24:10] than the godhead then this first
[1:24:12] creation created all the rest of the
[1:24:13] universe and whatever it contains he
[1:24:15] says but that's not right you know that
[1:24:18] doesn't line up with the rest of the
[1:24:19] Bible amen the words are he is the
[1:24:21] beginner or the author of the creation
[1:24:24] of God yes he said now that's different
[1:24:26] that brings on a different connotation
[1:24:29] so there is no doubt that he is the
[1:24:30] creator he is the creator of a FSH
[1:24:32] physical creation yes he created the
[1:24:35] universe where did it come from out of
[1:24:37] nothing right we talk about the Big Bang
[1:24:39] all the big bang is saying out of
[1:24:41] nothing everything
[1:24:42] came that is in essence
[1:24:45] what they have no way to explain this
[1:24:48] true okay amen so out of nothing
[1:24:50] everything came okay that's
[1:24:57] fine so he goes on and go goes on
[1:25:00] brother Brown him in in in the in the
[1:25:02] seven Church ages there and Lady see him
[1:25:04] he says he calls himself the author of
[1:25:06] the creation of God this is another
[1:25:08] creation this has to do with the church
[1:25:11] this is a special designation of
[1:25:13] himself he is the creator of that church
[1:25:16] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:25:19] bride yes the Heavenly bride Jesus Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ God himself created you Amen wors
[1:25:26] in all yes he created you the way you
[1:25:28] are because that's the way he wanted you
[1:25:31] right right
[1:25:33] okay what was Jesus Christ he says it
[1:25:35] was a God man he was the son of God he
[1:25:38] was a new creation man and God met and
[1:25:41] joined he was the first of of this new
[1:25:44] race he is the head of this new race in
[1:25:46] Colossians he is the head of the body of
[1:25:48] the church he goes on now in Union with
[1:25:51] Christ he has
[1:25:53] in Union with Christ we have become this
[1:25:56] part of this new creation of
[1:25:59] God when you received the Holy when you
[1:26:02] were born you were a son or daughter of
[1:26:05] God Amen because God see God placed his
[1:26:08] seed in you before the foundations of
[1:26:10] the world when you were born that seed
[1:26:12] was in you then right in the process of
[1:26:15] time you heard the
[1:26:16] gospel what responded to that the part
[1:26:19] of God that was in you from the
[1:26:20] beginning all of a sudden God
[1:26:22] that that seed all of a sudden heard
[1:26:24] something and responded to that and that
[1:26:26] seed began to grow and began to express
[1:26:28] itself amen and then what did God do
[1:26:31] after you after you've gone through the
[1:26:33] process of accepting your salvation and
[1:26:35] then and then repenting of your sins and
[1:26:37] Desiring to have the fullness of God
[1:26:39] then God comes and dwells in
[1:26:41] you that's when you become this this new
[1:26:44] man that's when you become this God man
[1:26:47] that's when that the God man is God
[1:26:49] dwelling in human flesh yes that's what
[1:26:51] it was in Jesus Christ amen God when he
[1:26:53] was born he was the son of God but at
[1:26:56] the River Jordan God came in his
[1:26:58] fullness and dwelt in that body then he
[1:27:00] that's when he became this God man
[1:27:03] praise the lord well when you receive
[1:27:05] the Holy Spirit what do you become you
[1:27:08] become this God man you become where God
[1:27:10] himself dwells in your Tabernacle
[1:27:17] right brother R goes on this he says but
[1:27:19] now out of every Kindred tribe and
[1:27:21] Nation has purposed a new creation he
[1:27:24] was the first of that creation he was
[1:27:26] God created in the form of man now by
[1:27:29] his spirit is creating many sons unto
[1:27:31] himself God the Creator is creating
[1:27:34] himself a part of his creation yes God
[1:27:37] is recreating God is creating himself in
[1:27:40] you yes where you will become the
[1:27:43] creation of God you will become the
[1:27:44] manifestation of God himself
[1:27:47] amen praise the Lord the only thing of
[1:27:49] is you have two
[1:27:50] Natures right you have the nature you
[1:27:53] were born with that nature comes from
[1:27:55] the union of your
[1:27:57] parents you are the you express the
[1:27:59] nature of your parents right I mean
[1:28:02] there are mannerisms that I have that
[1:28:05] like my mother there other mannerisms I
[1:28:07] have that like my father why because I'm
[1:28:10] a product of their
[1:28:11] Union but now there's another Union
[1:28:15] where my real father is God yes right I
[1:28:18] was a part of God from the beginning I
[1:28:20] came into manifestation through the
[1:28:22] through the through the the birth of you
[1:28:24] know my parents but now what God is
[1:28:27] trying to do is he's trying to take my
[1:28:30] nature and I have to die out to what I
[1:28:33] am in my physical flesh yes and begin to
[1:28:36] allow the very nature of God to express
[1:28:38] itself through me amen but that means I
[1:28:42] have to die yes yes I have to die to
[1:28:45] myself not physically die and put in the
[1:28:48] grave that'll come eventually probably
[1:28:50] but I have I have to die to my
[1:28:54] own when you were baptized and you Rose

[1:29:00] declaration I have died to myself I have
[1:29:03] desire died to my desires I have desire
[1:29:05] I have died to all the desires of My
[1:29:07] Flesh I have I have died to everything
[1:29:09] that I had pre-planned for the rest of
[1:29:11] my life amen and now what I'm doing I
[1:29:14] rising out of the water to a new life
[1:29:16] yes dedicated fully and wholly and
[1:29:19] solely to serve God Amen praise the Lord
[1:29:22] amen the only problem is we don't stay
[1:29:24] dead yeah I mean maybe you more than I
[1:29:28] have but I still fight this right amen
[1:29:32] but more and more I'm beginning to
[1:29:34] realize that Lord I am here to serve
[1:29:36] your purpose yes I here to do what you

[1:29:42] others as you would guide and direct me

[1:29:49] minister to each other yes you minister
[1:29:52] to each other by by just speaking a kind
[1:29:54] word by praying for them by lifting them
[1:29:57] up before God Amen and by doing the just
[1:30:00] just by fellowshipping and encouraging
[1:30:02] each other okay right yeah so he said
[1:30:05] now by his spirit is he is creating many
[1:30:07] sons unto himself God the Creator is
[1:30:10] creating himself a part of his creation

[1:30:16] God Amen that's you yes you are to be
[1:30:22] the true Revelation praise the Lord God

[1:30:29] this purpose took the form of through
[1:30:31] election it goes on and this is the
[1:30:33] interesting part his Sovereign power
[1:30:36] brought it to pass by his own decree he
[1:30:40] elected the members of this new creation
[1:30:43] amen he predestinated them for the
[1:30:45] adoption of children according to good
[1:30:47] pleasure of his will by his omnipotence
[1:30:51] omissions and omnipotence he brought it
[1:30:54] to pass yes amen it's not about you it's
[1:30:59] about him amen it's not about you
[1:31:02] striving to
[1:31:04] become it's about you taking and resting
[1:31:06] in him and letting him begin to mold you
[1:31:10] and make you into His Image

[1:31:15] mean we often struggle to become what we
[1:31:18] think a Christian should be yeah
[1:31:21] Christian should be this way this way
[1:31:22] this way this way sure the only problem
[1:31:24] is our flesh ISS yeah try
[1:31:27] it but see as I rest in him and allow
[1:31:31] him having the preeminence in my
[1:31:34] life I automatically begin to manifest
[1:31:37] and do those
[1:31:39] things so I don't struggle with this
[1:31:42] anymore amen I said Lord I'm here yeah I
[1:31:45] get up in you know I made some mistakes
[1:31:48] today I'm sorry I I dwell in a clay

[1:32:02] you can as much as you want to you use
[1:32:04] me for whatever purpose you see fit amen
[1:32:08] I remember brother brandham he told a
[1:32:10] story I think he was ministering up in
[1:32:13] Washington
[1:32:14] state and there was a young man there he
[1:32:16] was he was in the military service and
[1:32:19] he was going to commit suicide
[1:32:22] and brother Bram addressed him from the
[1:32:24] pulpit he said 'd don't do that and he
[1:32:27] talked to he talked to ministered a
[1:32:28] little bit and then anyway the next day
[1:32:31] they got in a car and I guess they were
[1:32:33] heading up into Alaska that that I think
[1:32:35] that's where they were going anyway they
[1:32:37] stopped off to have breakfast and
[1:32:39] brother Bram was just joking and kidding
[1:32:41] and being brother
[1:32:42] Bram but all of a sudden another car
[1:32:45] drove up and that boy happened to be in
[1:32:47] that other
[1:32:48] car they came into the restaurant and
[1:32:51] sat down
[1:32:52] and what I've heard he says brother
[1:32:54] bram's countenance
[1:32:56] changed and brother Bram excuse
[1:32:59] me then he went over to that young man
[1:33:03] and he ministered to him and he cast The
[1:33:05] Demon out of him amen God needed brother
[1:33:10] brandham there at that time to minister
[1:33:13] to that boy yes God orchestrated it God
[1:33:18] pre-planned it because when that boy
[1:33:21] left that they left that restaurant he
[1:33:23] he began Tobe if I remember right he
[1:33:25] says I'm free I'm free I'm
[1:33:27] free amen but see God orchestrated
[1:33:30] praise the Lord Brother Bram up until
[1:33:32] that time was brother Bram he was
[1:33:34] kidding joking laughing doing what he
[1:33:36] does sure but when God needed him yeah
[1:33:39] God took possession yes and ministered
[1:33:42] amen it's no
[1:33:46] different I mean I'm trying there's no
[1:33:48] difference here come on yes he was the
[1:33:51] prophet
[1:33:52] yes but God does is God limited to him

[1:33:57] how many years ago no no he's alive
[1:34:00] today amen he has a body that's us yes
[1:34:04] and he's wanting to do through us the
[1:34:06] same he did through the prophet amen you
[1:34:09] have just as much right to pray for for
[1:34:11] your neighbor and your friends and your
[1:34:12] relatives as as anybody else does that's
[1:34:14] right prayer is not limited to the
[1:34:17] ministry amen right if it is we're in
[1:34:19] bad shape right

[1:34:26] of you yes you are the body of Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ yes where does God dwell where
[1:34:31] does this logos dwell Amen in you the
[1:34:34] very essence of everything God is dwells
[1:34:37] in you right and you and he all he he he
[1:34:41] will never force you to do something
[1:34:44] that he that you will not allow him to
[1:34:45] do amen there was a time that one of our
[1:34:48] brothers in church um he had a he had
[1:34:52] surgery on his
[1:34:54] elbow surgery went about as well as the
[1:34:57] doctors could do it then he got a staff
[1:35:00] infection so they put antibiotics in it
[1:35:04] it seemed to take care of it then it
[1:35:06] came back and they irrigated and did
[1:35:09] something else and then it came back and
[1:35:12] God spoke to me he says we're not
[1:35:14] dealing with a physical problem we're
[1:35:16] dealing with a spiritual problem that's
[1:35:18] what God told me yeah he says go pray
[1:35:21] for him
[1:35:22] amen why don't you why why not the
[1:35:25] pastor why not the deacons why not the
[1:35:27] trustees why me I hate going to
[1:35:30] Charlotte traffic is terrible
[1:35:34] there if I had
[1:35:36] refused he never would have been prayed
[1:35:39] for and the infection would have taken
[1:35:41] his arm
[1:35:43] off but okay all right okay Lord I'll go
[1:35:46] I'll go
[1:35:47] amen went up there we visited a little
[1:35:50] bit and he said why are you here here I
[1:35:52] said God told me to come pray for you I
[1:35:55] said we're dealing with a spiritual
[1:35:57] problem not a physical amen so I cast
[1:35:59] The Demon out which was the
[1:36:02] infection and uh yeah then it was healed
[1:36:05] praise the Lord amen amen that doesn't
[1:36:08] make me anything right amen okay I
[1:36:12] didn't want to
[1:36:13] go but God impressed upon me this I need
[1:36:17] you to go amen you know Moses didn't
[1:36:20] want to go back to Egypt
[1:36:21] right he said well you choose somebody
[1:36:23] else he said I can't speak it very good
[1:36:25] anymore and there want I'm wanted for
[1:36:26] murder there and I got all these reasons
[1:36:28] why I cannot going I got a wife and I
[1:36:30] got kids and I got all these goats I got
[1:36:32] to take care of and God says you're
[1:36:33] going I don't have I don't have plan
[1:36:36] B your plan a plan a is the only plan I
[1:36:40] have right so he finally
[1:36:43] went you look at Jeremiah Jeremiah
[1:36:46] wanted to
[1:36:47] quit Lord you didn't tell me the
[1:36:49] problems I was going to have everybody
[1:36:51] hates me I like people but everybody
[1:36:53] hates me I'm not going to preach anymore
[1:36:56] I'm going to shut my mouth I'm going to
[1:36:57] go
[1:36:58] hide all of a sudden God says and and
[1:37:01] all of a sudden the spirit of God the
[1:37:02] word of God was in him like burning in
[1:37:04] the bones yeah he says I have no options
[1:37:07] I have to say what God gives me to say
[1:37:09] amen he wanted to quit that's right you
[1:37:12] talk to most
[1:37:14] ministers um after a while they yeah I
[1:37:17] like to preach but I sure don't like to
[1:37:19] be Pastor because I got all these
[1:37:20] problems
[1:37:22] anyway at least that's what others have
[1:37:24] said so but you have to realize God is
[1:37:29] God needs us to do what God wants us to
[1:37:32] do amen but you have to be willing to do
[1:37:36] as he directs yes this requires a
[1:37:40] relationship amen you have to know him
[1:37:43] amen you have to talk to him you have to
[1:37:47] interact with
[1:37:49] him so that he can tell you what what
[1:37:51] he's wanting for you to do
[1:37:54] amen it says in Hebrews 2:14 it says for
[1:37:57] as much that as the children were
[1:37:59] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:38:01] himself likewise took part of the saints
[1:38:03] that through death he might destroy him
[1:38:05] that had power of death that is the
[1:38:07] devil and deliver them who through their
[1:38:09] fear of death were all their lifetime
[1:38:10] subject to bondage for verily he took
[1:38:13] not in him the nature of angels but he
[1:38:14] took upon him the Seed of Abraham yes
[1:38:17] therefore in all things it behooved him
[1:38:19] to be made like unto his Brethren that
[1:38:20] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:38:23] priest and things pertain to God to make
[1:38:25] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:38:27] people praise the Lord am he's our high
[1:38:29] priest yes because he suffered like we
[1:38:32] suffered amen he was born just like we
[1:38:34] were born he was a little bitty baby
[1:38:37] just like we were at one point in time
[1:38:39] and as he had to go through the teenage
[1:38:41] years with all the changes in the
[1:38:43] hormones and all the other things that
[1:38:45] affect you as you go through that
[1:38:47] process amen he had the same Temptations
[1:38:50] we have right he had the same problems
[1:38:52] in essence we have yes but because of
[1:38:55] the nature of God there was in him he
[1:38:57] was able to overcome those things
[1:39:08] yes Jesus Christ had to be born under
[1:39:11] the
[1:39:11] law so that the law that God had given
[1:39:14] through
[1:39:15] Moses would apply to
[1:39:18] him if he had been born in in Syria he'
[1:39:22] BN in some other place their laws of of
[1:39:25] of redemption would not have applied the
[1:39:28] same but he came to redeem he came to
[1:39:31] restore us back to what we were with God
[1:39:34] from the beginning amen
[1:39:36] amen because it says it was well it
[1:39:40] talks about in in in Leviticus 25 it
[1:39:43] talks about the near kinman coming in
[1:39:45] redeeming and once the Redeemer came and
[1:39:48] paid the price the one who was redeemed
[1:39:51] could go back to his belong back to his
[1:39:53] land he could go back to his house he
[1:39:55] could go back to his family everything
[1:39:57] was restored as if he had never if he
[1:39:59] had never sold himself into slavery
[1:40:01] right amen you see that's where we're
[1:40:05] going that's where we're we are going
[1:40:07] back to what we were in God before the
[1:40:09] fall amen we are being restored back to
[1:40:13] the Garden of Eden again we are being
[1:40:15] restored back to what we were in God
[1:40:16] before there was a fall before there was
[1:40:18] sin before there was any imperfection
[1:40:20] prise this is where we are being taken
[1:40:22] back to because this is what restoration
[1:40:24] means
[1:40:29] yes brother Bram says in possessing the
[1:40:32] Gate of the enemy he says he says now
[1:40:36] but when Jesus the son of God was virgin
[1:40:38] born shed his blood the life that was in
[1:40:41] the blood was God's
[1:40:44] itself he goes on he says God created
[1:40:48] both the egg and the blood cell and that
[1:40:50] was the tabernacle of God okay and he
[1:40:53] says we are saved by the blood of God
[1:40:55] that's where my faith is yes not walk
[1:40:57] out there in the blood of a prophet not
[1:40:59] walk out there in the blood of an
[1:41:01] ordinary man or a teacher or a
[1:41:02] theologian we walk out there in the
[1:41:04] blood of God God said so he become human
[1:41:08] being he changed his stand he he
[1:41:10] stretched his tent here with us and he
[1:41:12] became one of us he is our kinsman
[1:41:15] redeemer he had to become a Kinfolk to
[1:41:17] us because that was what because that
[1:41:19] was the law God became man and dwelt
[1:41:22] Among Us amen then in Galatians 4 it
[1:41:24] says but when the fullness of time was
[1:41:26] come God sent forth a son made of a
[1:41:28] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:41:31] that were under the law that we might
[1:41:32] receive the adoption of sons praise the
[1:41:35] Lord yes if we had not been redeemed we
[1:41:37] could never be restored as Sons and
[1:41:39] Daughters amen but by being redeemed we
[1:41:42] can go back to being what God intended
[1:41:44] for us to be from the beginning amen we
[1:41:47] can go back to being Sons and Daughters
[1:41:49] of God and actually that applies to us
[1:41:51] now yes yes but we're not willing to
[1:41:54] accept it true we're not willing to
[1:41:57] believe what we are in Christ it's not
[1:42:00] what we are by ourselves because by
[1:42:01] ourselves we're nothing amen okay by
[1:42:04] ourselves we're failures by ourselves
[1:42:06] you know we're just rotten old human
[1:42:08] flesh walking around on two feet until
[1:42:10] eventually they stick in the grave and
[1:42:11] it rots yeah that that that's what
[1:42:14] that's what this flesh is right but
[1:42:15] because we were a part of him from the
[1:42:17] beginning yes that's the difference
[1:42:20] we're being restored back as his son and
[1:42:23] daughter and and if we can and and what
[1:42:25] brother Brown said in one place he says
[1:42:27] when the bride begins to realize who and
[1:42:28] what she is she'll do the Greater Works
[1:42:30] amen right but we pull back from
[1:42:33] that because we we we begin to
[1:42:36] understand if I am restored back to as a
[1:42:38] son and daughter of God that means
[1:42:40] everything that God is I have access to
[1:42:42] yes right that's the power that dwells
[1:42:46] in each one of us
[1:42:48] amen and then we think about about that
[1:42:51] he
[1:42:51] says uhuh we don't believe it we're not
[1:42:55] willing to accept it until you can
[1:42:58] accept who you are amen God cannot fully
[1:43:01] fulfill yes okay amen SM in church AG he
[1:43:05] says now then we're coming to a
[1:43:07] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[1:43:10] manifested in the son in Jesus Christ
[1:43:12] all the fullness of the godhead bod and
[1:43:15] that Eternal one was the was was the
[1:43:18] father manifested in the flesh and
[1:43:19] thereby gained the title son so he's
[1:43:22] taking Jesus Christ making him deity
[1:43:24] making him to be all powerful amen he
[1:43:26] says then he goes on even so
[1:43:29] we he's taking us and equating us with
[1:43:32] the same manifestation the same with go
[1:43:35] with Jesus Christ even as we even as he
[1:43:38] was in the mind of God so we were in the
[1:43:40] mind of God even as even as that logos
[1:43:43] that God created we were in that Loos
[1:43:45] amen even even and then then we we were
[1:43:47] born we were we put into flesh yes even
[1:43:50] in the same way that God came in Jesus
[1:43:52] Christ now God is coming in us okay he
[1:43:55] goes on because see even so we Eternal
[1:43:58] in his thoughts in our turn became the

[1:46:04] lineage of David he would have no rights
[1:46:08] to the throne of David right okay and
[1:46:12] and the thing that we find when when you

[1:46:18] birth the people were expecting the
[1:46:21] kingh they weren't expecting a redeemer
[1:46:25] they were expecting the king yeah as we
[1:46:28] go and we look at Mary in Luke in Luke 1
[1:46:31] and what 32 and he he shall be great he
[1:46:35] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:46:37] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:46:39] Throne of his father David and he shall
[1:46:41] reign over the House of David forever
[1:46:43] and his kingdom there shall be nowh yes
[1:46:45] that's what they were looking for amen
[1:46:48] and Zach is zachar yeah okay
[1:46:51] he goes on his prayer talking about
[1:46:54] talking about about John the Baptist
[1:46:57] that we should be saved from our enemies
[1:46:59] and from the hand of all that hate us to
[1:47:01] perform the mercy promise to our father
[1:47:04] and to and remember His Holy Covenant
[1:47:06] the oath which God swear to Our Father
[1:47:07] Abraham that he would Grant unto us that
[1:47:10] we being delivered out of the hand of
[1:47:11] our enemies might serve him without fear
[1:47:13] in Hol and righteousness before him all
[1:47:16] the days of our life and thou child

[1:47:19] highest and thou shalt go before him to
[1:47:21] prepare the way for the Lord amen they
[1:47:24] were expecting a king yeah yes they
[1:47:27] weren't expecting the way he came
[1:47:35] right but we go on and and and John the
[1:47:38] John the Baptist became very um
[1:47:41] disillusioned when he saw you know when
[1:47:44] Jesus Christ he wasn't behaving like a
[1:47:47] king yeah he's just a humble little man
[1:47:49] going around doing good things he sent
[1:47:52] two of his disciples and said to Jesus
[1:47:55] are they he that should come or should
[1:47:58] we be looking for another one yeah when
[1:48:00] the men were come to him and said John
[1:48:02] the Baptist sent us okay we look for
[1:48:04] another one in that same hour he cured
[1:48:07] many of their infirmities and BLS evil
[1:48:10] spirits and to many that were blind he
[1:48:13] gave sight Jesus answering said go go
[1:48:16] your way and tell John the things that
[1:48:18] ye have heard seen and heard the blind
[1:48:20] see the lame walk rers are cleansed the

[1:48:55] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:48:57] heal the brokenhearted to preach

[1:49:11] being fulfilled praise the Lord amen he
[1:49:14] came to
[1:49:15] redeem he came to defeat Satan yes he
[1:49:19] came to pay the price for our Redemption

[1:50:10] him to fulfill that scripture amen that
[1:50:14] scripture is to be f is the continuation
[1:50:16] of that is to be fulfilled now through

[1:50:57] of the ministry of Jesus Christ yes amen

[1:51:21] Brandon was not Jesus Christ no he was a
[1:51:25] sinner just like we are amen right but
[1:51:27] he over period of his own life he began
[1:51:29] to learn how to yield himself to the
[1:51:31] spirit of God that dwelt in him and the
[1:51:33] more he was able to yield himself to the
[1:51:35] spirit of God that was in him the more
[1:51:37] that God could take and manifest himself
[1:51:39] through him amen and see that's where it
[1:51:41] comes out into Us Praise the Lord the
[1:51:43] more we can learn to yield ourselves our
[1:51:46] bodies into the god that dwells in us
[1:51:48] the more that that God can be able to
[1:51:50] manifest and express himself through US

[1:51:57] preeminence in

[2:04:30] we'll make sure every bit of it goes for
[2:04:31] brother null and uh be a an extension of
[2:04:35] the ministry that he has to those people
[2:04:37] in India of course and of course
[2:04:39] wherever the Lord sends him but we know
[2:04:41] he's had that Ministry to India for
[2:04:43] years and we tried to support it the
[2:04:45] best as possible and just good to hear
[2:04:47] that he's continuing that even though
[2:04:49] they're not necessarily physically going
[2:04:52] as much as they were uh that they're
[2:04:54] able still to minister to those people
[2:04:56] amen so the seed's been swn and just
[2:04:58] continue to water it and the technology
[2:05:01] the Lord has invented to be able to do
[2:05:04] it on computers and whatever and uh the
[2:05:07] Lord just bless you richly in it brother
[2:05:09] all so give us unto the Lord if you can
[2:05:12] uh thinking the other day the only time
[2:05:14] I thinking I've pastored for how many
[2:05:16] years I don't even know I've ever asked
[2:05:18] is for somebody else for a visiting
[2:05:20] Minister because a labor is worthy of
[2:05:22] his hire and I believe brother no
[2:05:24] laboring for us today to bring us the
[2:05:26] word amen so give us unto the Lord if
[2:05:29] you will amen and of course we give with
[2:05:32] brother noan brother Shirley and bless
[2:05:33] him in the ministry amen and um thankful
