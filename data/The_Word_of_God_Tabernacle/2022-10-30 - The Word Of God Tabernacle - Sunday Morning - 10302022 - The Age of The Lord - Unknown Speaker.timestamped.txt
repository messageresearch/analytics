[39:46] praise the Lord Jesus amen so wonderful
[39:50] isn't it amen praise the Lord God is so
[39:53] good to us
[39:58] I mean let's change what the service now
[40:00] amen stand to our feet now we'll go
[40:02] right to the scripture
[40:05] and we're gonna
[40:06] as I do
[40:10] every week
[40:12] start beginning to think about what the
[40:15] Lord would have because
[40:17] you know when you're on a series like
[40:19] we've been on with the new beginning it
[40:21] uh
[40:22] um it kind of almost becomes default but
[40:25] the next service is going to be
[40:27] that but I don't treat it that way I
[40:30] honestly don't because I don't want to
[40:31] just fall into a Rudder routine that
[40:33] that's just going to be it I want to
[40:35] find the mind of the Lord yes and last
[40:37] week and if it's something that's
[40:38] different or something that's out of the
[40:41] routine if you will that the Lord wants
[40:43] and last week he put on my heart
[40:45] something that
[40:46] I believe he wanted me to bring today
[40:49] and in And in regards to the season that
[40:54] we're facing and what's going on around
[40:56] us and of course the holiday that the
[40:59] country celebrates tomorrow uh I felt
[41:03] led to bring this today so let's turn to
[41:05] job
[41:06] uh we're gonna go to Job chapter 1.
[41:14] so we're going to change it a little bit
[41:16] today with the Lord Jameson uh today so
[41:19] maybe if the Lord willing that the next
[41:21] week will get back up to where we are uh
[41:25] with the new beginning in the Millennium
[41:27] so might that be the little will of the
[41:29] Lord
[41:31] and we'll pursue with that but this week
[41:32] we're going to touch on this call this
[41:35] message the angel of the Lord names of
[41:38] the Lord and I will be uh just blunt
[41:40] with you obviously I've got nothing to
[41:43] hide but the first thing that came on my
[41:45] mind was uh was spirits and speaking on
[41:49] Spirits which sometimes I do around
[41:51] Halloween around this time and and not
[41:53] just Halloween friend but also we get
[41:55] into the Christmas uh time and things as
[41:59] demonic spirits that just swirl
[42:01] continuously around us and I woke up the
[42:04] other day and the Lord put a song on my
[42:05] heart and I was coming to church and you
[42:08] know to study and all and I thought I
[42:10] thought Lord did you put this on my
[42:11] heart to change my thought uh to not
[42:15] necessarily speak on the Demonic or evil
[42:17] spirits and I felt the Lord changed it
[42:20] to put it in the other direction so
[42:22] we're going to talk about the angel of
[42:23] the Lord we're going to talk about uh
[42:25] the spirits of God Amen Holy Spirits not
[42:29] the demonic spirits some much amen so
[42:32] we're going to go to job chapter 1.
[42:35] we can begin with verse six but before
[42:38] we do let's just bow our heads for
[42:39] another word of prayer if we could
[42:41] Precious Jesus father we're so thankful
[42:44] Lord that you give us something to uh to
[42:47] stand on Lord and for us in your word
[42:50] God for you to reveal to us and show us
[42:53] the hour and the day that we're living
[42:54] Lord and and of course to encourage us
[42:57] and strengthen us along our ways God
[42:59] it's a journey that we take God that
[43:01] we've dedicated consecrated to you and
[43:03] believing your presence to be here
[43:05] knowing that your spirit is living
[43:07] within us and that God could do the
[43:09] exceeding abundantly even now in this
[43:12] service Lord above all that we could
[43:13] ever ask or think Lord we just pray once
[43:17] again that this word would come forth
[43:19] yes Empower and manifestation you the
[43:23] word itself says that by the preaching
[43:25] of the word comes faith faith to
[43:27] increase by the preaching of this word
[43:30] comes healing and we believe that
[43:31] healing comes forth Lord from your word
[43:33] because it's all by faith we Believe We
[43:36] Believe today God that your hand is upon
[43:38] us and you're going to bring us and
[43:40] Deliver us into higher Heights and
[43:42] deeper depths of your word and your
[43:44] spirit so God I pray take complete
[43:46] control over me Lord over each one of us
[43:49] over this service and the remaining part
[43:51] of it and let it be according to what
[43:53] your purpose would be for it now as we
[43:55] commit it to you we rebuke every demonic
[43:57] spirit that would try to hurt hinder and
[43:59] filtrate this service in any way that
[44:02] you would get the glory honor and praise
[44:04] for all that is said and done here today
[44:06] we thank you for it Lord and to you be
[44:08] the glory and honor and Lord may God we
[44:11] not leave here but what you've done of
[44:14] work in each of Our Lives God and by
[44:16] faith we believe now standing upon that
[44:19] word so granted here is we delve into
[44:21] this word once again Lord one more time
[44:24] here in this service now today in the
[44:26] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[44:28] amen
[44:30] Job chapter 1 verse 6. excuse me now
[44:34] there was a day when the sons of God
[44:36] came to present themselves before the
[44:38] Lord Satan came also among them and the
[44:41] Lord said unto Satan whence cometh thou
[44:44] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[44:46] from going to and fro in the earth and
[44:48] from walking up and down in it the Lord
[44:51] said unto Satan hast thou considered my
[44:54] servant job that there is none like him
[44:56] in the earth a perfect and an upright
[45:00] man one that feareth God and turneth
[45:03] from a shoe of evil turneth aside from
[45:06] Evil then Satan answered the Lord and
[45:09] said the job fear God for not hath not
[45:12] Thou made an hedge about him and about
[45:14] his house and about all that he hath on
[45:17] every side thou has blessed the work of
[45:20] his hands and his substance is increased
[45:22] in the land but put forth thine hand now
[45:27] touch all that he hath and he will curse
[45:30] thee to thy face
[45:32] and the Lord said unto Satan behold all
[45:34] that he hath is in thy power only upon
[45:37] himself put not forth thine hand so
[45:40] Satan went forth from the presence of
[45:42] the Lord you could be seated if you'd
[45:44] like
[45:46] going to talk about job just a little
[45:48] bit but I want to go over to Psalms and
[45:51] couple this scripture reading with
[45:52] Psalms chapter 24 a 34 excuse me Psalms
[45:57] chapter 34.
[46:03] amen Psalms chapter 34
[46:06] we'll come back to job in a minute if
[46:08] you want to keep your place there
[46:10] so much in job to talk about but again I
[46:14] want to couple that scripture with
[46:15] Psalms 34. we'll begin with verse 1.
[46:19] Psalms 34 1.
[46:22] David says I will bless the Lord at all
[46:25] times his praise shall continually be in
[46:28] my mouth my soul shall make her boast in
[46:31] the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof
[46:34] and be glad o magnify the Lord with me
[46:37] and let us exalt his name together
[46:40] assault the Lord and he heard me and
[46:43] delivered me from all my fears
[46:45] they looked unto me uh they looked unto
[46:49] him and were lightened and their faces
[46:51] were not ashamed this poor man cried and
[46:55] the Lord heard him and saved him out of
[46:57] all his troubles
[46:59] the angel of the Lord encamped the round
[47:02] about them that fear Him and delivereth
[47:06] them amen the angel of the Lord which is
[47:10] our service title again this morning the
[47:12] angel of the Lord look at David's
[47:15] exclamation here
[47:16] the angel of the Lord encampeth around
[47:20] about them that fear Him and delivereth
[47:24] them and delivereth them we don't want
[47:27] to forget that part A lot of times we
[47:29] talk about the angels of the Lord and
[47:30] camping about those that fear him but we
[47:33] don't want to forget the part where it
[47:34] says he delivers us also he's not just
[47:38] around us but delivereth Us Praise the
[47:41] Lord so the angel of the Lord encamped
[47:44] the encampeth around about them that
[47:47] love him now or is it fear him which is
[47:49] a reverence which is a love but now
[47:52] let's go back to job and look at this
[47:53] for a moment because Satan made a
[47:56] proclamation to God a very important
[47:59] Proclamation
[48:00] in the 10th verse that job that that
[48:03] Satan said to God that job serves you
[48:06] for a reason God came up and told Satan
[48:10] that job was perfect he was upright uh
[48:13] perfect means he was morally and
[48:16] ethically pure he was a mature adult he
[48:19] was of complete age upright means he was
[48:22] pleasing to God and did everything
[48:24] correctly in the eyes of God Amen and
[48:27] this was before the blood of Jesus
[48:30] Christ was ever shed and the Holy Spirit
[48:32] come down on God's people
[48:34] job lived in that state in that at that
[48:37] time but then Satan come back and said
[48:40] but God job serves you for a reason
[48:42] there's a reason job doesn't just serve
[48:45] you and see that's the same attitude
[48:47] Satan has about all of us today Satan
[48:50] believes that you only serve God because
[48:53] God does stuff for you or because God
[48:55] has given you something or God this that
[48:58] and the other and there's a reason why
[49:00] we serve God friend there is no if you
[49:03] are a true holy ghost-filled son or
[49:05] daughter of God there is only one reason
[49:08] that you serve the Lord Jesus and that's
[49:11] because you love it period there is no
[49:14] other reason it didn't cause he healed
[49:16] you it didn't cause he saved your family
[49:18] and in because you grew up that way it
[49:20] is because of a great Church of the
[49:22] movie The Spirit of filling on your
[49:24] flesh you serve the Lord Jesus for one
[49:27] reason that's because you love it Amen
[49:29] period That's the only reason but Satan
[49:31] can't understand
[49:33] he can't seem to grab the grass fathom
[49:36] even being God's right human he just
[49:39] can't seem to understand that there's a
[49:42] people that serve God and that love God
[49:44] and that dedicate and consecrate their
[49:47] lives to him based solely on the fact
[49:50] that we have faith in him that he exists
[49:54] and we love him based on the emotion the
[49:57] feeling the the spirit of God that's in
[50:00] us to love him with we love the Lord and
[50:03] he can't understand that and when he
[50:05] told God that very same thing about Joe
[50:07] job doesn't serve you for no reason God
[50:10] God job doesn't just serve you you've
[50:13] been good to joke look what he said
[50:15] again let's read it
[50:17] God that job doesn't serve you for no
[50:19] reason
[50:20] Doug doesn't serve you for not they'll
[50:23] put a hedge about him first amen amen
[50:27] a hedge is a barrier yes amen what kind
[50:30] of berry you think God puts around his
[50:32] children
[50:34] amen well I think we just read it David
[50:36] had a revelation of it amen Ames the
[50:38] Lord and camps around about those that
[50:41] feared him that love him praise the Lord
[50:45] God puts a hedge about each one of us
[50:48] God has a hedge around each of you God
[50:50] has a hedge around this place God has a
[50:53] hedge around his people what is that
[50:55] hedge that Hedges those angels of God
[50:58] that are here in protection over
[51:01] anything that Satan would try to do
[51:03] right that hedge is impenetrable unless
[51:07] God allows it for some reason just like
[51:09] God allowed here you say well Satan
[51:11] sometimes is this and you aren't feeling
[51:13] good this week and blah blah blah and
[51:15] Satan always makes excuses but there's a
[51:18] reason for everything God does we may
[51:20] not always understand it in fact
[51:22] probably a lot of times we don't
[51:24] understand God's ways but he has a
[51:26] reason he has a purpose and we've come
[51:29] to know God and to trust him enough to
[51:31] realize that whatever that purpose is
[51:33] it's going to work together for my good
[51:35] right so as hard as it is sometimes and
[51:38] it's frustrating or maybe even angry we
[51:41] may get God has a reason there's a
[51:44] purpose but that hedge now that's the
[51:46] first thing
[51:47] Satan is telling God now say job serves
[51:51] you first of all because you've got to
[51:53] protected all these angels around I
[51:55] can't even get to him because of the
[51:57] heads that you've got around him this
[52:00] barrier that you put up around job I
[52:02] can't get through that barrier how am I
[52:04] supposed to touch job when there's no
[52:07] way to get through the barrier
[52:09] amen aren't you glad that barrier still
[52:12] exists today that barrier is still just
[52:15] as real today because remember
[52:17] Revelation 12 Satan drew a third of the
[52:20] angels of the stars of heaven and were
[52:23] cast down upon the Earth but there were
[52:25] two-thirds do your math right
[52:28] if you got three thirds and you take
[52:30] one-thirds you got two-thirds left so
[52:32] there's twice as many that are with us
[52:34] that is with them yes because there's
[52:37] one third that was cast out that means
[52:39] there's two-thirds with God's children
[52:41] yes and there's one third that Encompass
[52:45] the entire from the billions of people
[52:46] but there's two-thirds that are in
[52:49] protection of our sweet little bride
[52:51] thank you amen she's not in the billions
[52:53] friend
[52:54] praise the Lord I think I did the math
[52:57] one time if we had two million Holy
[53:00] Ghost filled
[53:01] God-fearing Christians today
[53:06] that would be 200
[53:09] Angels per person
[53:12] based on the scripture amen
[53:15] too high I think it's no maybe it was
[53:17] four I forget I lose the math but it's
[53:19] several hundred let's just put it that
[53:21] way of the angels of God
[53:24] assigned to each person
[53:28] that could theoretically I'm not saying
[53:30] they are we all have our own Angel of
[53:32] the Lord and the angel of God that's in
[53:34] Camp around about us we have that
[53:37] protection so I'm not saying that there
[53:40] are that many assigned to everyone but
[53:42] there absolutely could be by mathematics
[53:46] hundreds up to 400 Angels each person
[53:51] with you personally not the entire bride
[53:55] because remember there's two hundred
[53:57] thousand thousand demons loosed in
[53:59] Revelation 16 I believe it's 16. that's
[54:01] by the Riverview Euphrates those two
[54:03] hundred thousand thousand demons that
[54:05] means four that's two million or 200
[54:08] million I forget my math now that means
[54:10] there's twice of those that are Holy
[54:13] Angels that are in protection of God's
[54:16] people if there's two hundred thousand
[54:18] thousand there's four hundred thousand
[54:20] thousand angels in protection of God's
[54:23] little bride well if you break that down
[54:26] friend that's that that's quite a
[54:28] protection right
[54:30] right that's quite a hedge that God
[54:32] keeps around his children amen but now
[54:35] look again God Satan says you've got
[54:38] this hedge I cannot touch him
[54:41] that hedge is impenetrable I can't touch
[54:45] him can't get to him and that's the
[54:47] reason he serves you maybe you just
[54:49] letting Ned grubby paws at him and I'll
[54:51] make him curse you to your face
[54:53] amen and and what else have you done for
[54:56] him God
[54:58] you you've not only has Tim you've had
[55:01] his house and you hedged all that he has
[55:04] on every side
[55:06] every child his wife every building
[55:09] every animal every servant everything
[55:12] that belongs in the possession or the
[55:15] household of of job you have hedge not
[55:18] just job
[55:19] but all that is his
[55:21] oh friends don't you understand what I'm
[55:23] saying today all that is his is hedged
[55:29] all that is yours if you just
[55:33] with the Edge by the protection of God's
[55:36] holy angels if we just believe not just
[55:39] us but all that we have all of our
[55:42] household everything that belongs to us
[55:45] is hedged by God's angels protected amen
[55:48] amen and Satan admitted I can't get to
[55:53] him
[55:54] can't touch it you got him hedged you
[55:56] got all that he has has you blessed the
[55:59] work of his hands and his substances
[56:01] increased well no wonder he serves you
[56:03] God you've blessed him you've increased
[56:07] his hand well God could have come back
[56:09] to Satan and said well you know why I'm
[56:10] doing that because he's perfect and
[56:12] upright before me
[56:14] amen he gets rewarded for being such a a
[56:18] Godly individual I bless him because He
[56:22] blesses me
[56:23] it's a it's a communion that we have
[56:26] with each other it's not a one-way
[56:29] Street
[56:30] we do it God gives and we give back and
[56:33] we love him and he loves us and he loves
[56:35] us loves us unconditionally we try in
[56:38] our Humanity to love him back
[56:40] unconditionally but this has that keeps
[56:43] us protected is always with us amen
[56:47] never leaves when Jesus said I'll never
[56:49] leave you or forsake you that means that
[56:51] everything that is his remember in
[56:53] Genesis 18 when God was speaking to
[56:56] Abraham and God spoke to Abraham and he
[56:59] said I will go now to Sodom to see if
[57:02] it's as wicked as it's been reported
[57:06] but did God himself Elohim standing
[57:09] there eating fellowshipping with Abraham
[57:12] did he in that Corporal body literally
[57:14] go down to Sodom
[57:16] no he sent his two angels right
[57:20] he sent his two angels to go down there
[57:22] and spout the land on his behalf but God
[57:25] said I will go so that's just them two
[57:28] going was just as good as him being
[57:31] there himself
[57:32] praise the Lord amen so if it's if it's
[57:36] the hands of God even if it's God's
[57:39] angels it's just as good as him being
[57:41] there
[57:42] oh think of it friend if that's if if
[57:46] that's what God
[57:48] has done for each of us see and and the
[57:52] hard part is that
[57:54] we live so much on the CK spell smelling
[57:57] here
[57:58] we live so much on the conscience and
[58:01] Imagination reason affection memory we
[58:04] live so much on that on that flesh and
[58:06] that spirit
[58:07] and rightfully so by our eyes you don't
[58:11] see them all around you
[58:13] you don't touch them
[58:15] you can't feel them
[58:18] you you are they there are they not well
[58:21] the same faith that you believe
[58:25] that God is here it's the same Faith to
[58:27] know that God's honor of his word that
[58:30] the angel of the Lord encamped around
[58:31] those that fear Him yeah and we've got
[58:34] scriptural precedent to know that God
[58:36] does that
[58:37] how many times you say well this is
[58:41] happening and that's happening uh not
[58:43] feeling good here seek here or accident
[58:46] here or whatever but who knows but what
[58:48] those things that God does keeps us from
[58:52] other greater things that could have
[58:53] happened in our lives or that those are
[58:58] minor compared to some of the things
[59:00] that could happen if if if the Lord
[59:03] allowed
[59:05] how much worse could it be how much
[59:08] worse could it have gotten amen
[59:11] there's been a lot of people get sick
[59:13] over the past couple years and never
[59:15] recover right yeah praise the Lord I
[59:18] didn't have covet but uh but there's a
[59:21] lot of people have gotten sick and did
[59:23] not recover thank God that
[59:25] you know it could have been worse
[59:26] there's been a lot of people in car
[59:28] accidents who didn't walk away from them
[59:32] amen cars banged up maybe total just a
[59:35] car
[59:36] amen God's provision will take care of
[59:39] the rest we just trust the Lord is there
[59:43] a reason God has a reason for everything
[59:45] but his angels are there and camped
[59:48] around about us to keep us yes and to
[59:51] protect us I believe that's why David
[59:52] talked about that worship when he talked
[59:55] about it because you notice when he
[59:57] entered into that scripture writing he
[59:59] entered it in by saying that we worship
[1:00:01] God and we lift God up and we join
[1:00:04] together in Praise of the Lord that's he
[1:00:07] said that before he talked about the
[1:00:09] aims of the Lord in camping around about
[1:00:11] us remember
[1:00:14] God inhabits the Praises of his children
[1:00:17] he inhabits the Praises of his people
[1:00:20] that is something that is very pleasing
[1:00:22] to him so much amen that he joins in
[1:00:26] that Holy Angel band that comes just
[1:00:28] like they were when Paul and Silas were
[1:00:30] in the innermost prison praise God the
[1:00:34] Holy Angel man was surrounding him there
[1:00:36] even in that prison and as the walls
[1:00:39] begin to shake and the doors begin to
[1:00:40] come open the jailers were set free
[1:00:43] just from the mere fact that Paul and
[1:00:46] Silas decided they were going to worship
[1:00:49] God amen amen amen they worshiped God
[1:00:52] God came on the scene and look what took
[1:00:54] place even so much that the Jailer
[1:00:57] himself and all his house was saved
[1:01:00] right
[1:01:01] peace praise the Lord that's the work of
[1:01:04] God as your angels of the Lord being
[1:01:06] around us constantly we're battling the
[1:01:09] experience for instance these Spirits
[1:01:11] are all around us all the time and they
[1:01:13] seem to become even more prevalent
[1:01:15] around this time of year to where even
[1:01:19] I'm gonna I'm gonna use this so hope
[1:01:21] nobody's offended even Christians
[1:01:24] celebrate this demonic time and I just I
[1:01:28] don't understand it but it's not mine to
[1:01:31] do but they become more prevalent it
[1:01:35] seems they're an experience and you feel
[1:01:37] that press right that pressing of those
[1:01:40] Spirits I read an article the other day
[1:01:41] maybe it was yesterday where some young
[1:01:44] man was out in front he was promoting a
[1:01:48] a conservative speech on a man that was
[1:01:51] going to speak at this uh University
[1:01:54] which have become Havens for
[1:01:57] not such good stuff but anyway uh and
[1:02:01] and he was out and he was he was trying
[1:02:03] to sort of promote this man who is going
[1:02:06] to give a speech on what is a woman uh
[1:02:09] because a lot of people today don't seem
[1:02:11] to understand what a woman is anymore
[1:02:13] or man for that matter so he was
[1:02:16] standing there reading the Bible he was
[1:02:18] just reading scripture he had a
[1:02:19] microphone he was quoting scripture
[1:02:21] quotes and the demonic spirits around
[1:02:24] there became so wild and so angry that
[1:02:28] people ran up and grabbed the Bible out
[1:02:30] of his hand ripped the pages out and
[1:02:31] started eating the pages of the Bible
[1:02:33] wow
[1:02:35] I mean that's just animalistic friend
[1:02:38] yes
[1:02:39] yes just acting I I can't imagine what
[1:02:42] the scene looked like but started eating
[1:02:44] the pages out of the Bible that they had
[1:02:47] stole out of this young man's hand just
[1:02:49] trying just peacefully trying to do
[1:02:51] something normally peacefully just
[1:02:53] reading the scripture anybody don't want
[1:02:55] to listen you can pass right on by and
[1:02:57] go on about your life but Devils don't
[1:02:58] do that amen it hates them and they and
[1:03:02] he hates it so bad he hates you because
[1:03:05] he knows that's what defeats him right
[1:03:07] he knows it's the scripture that defeats
[1:03:10] him not your balled up fist not a kick
[1:03:13] but the word the word is what defeats
[1:03:17] him and he hates it that's what we're
[1:03:19] facing today with these demonic spirits
[1:03:21] friend is becoming such an oppressant
[1:03:24] spirit it's becoming such a a demonic
[1:03:27] time that we need to continue to
[1:03:30] remember of all that's going on around
[1:03:32] us greater is he that is in me
[1:03:36] we're going to eat of this in the world
[1:03:37] yes the angels of the Lord are encamped
[1:03:40] around about us that protect us that
[1:03:44] keep us safe and that take care of us if
[1:03:47] there was a hedge around job that came
[1:03:49] that kept Satan and all of his minions
[1:03:52] from touching job then what do you think
[1:03:54] that we have for us that God has for his
[1:03:56] children today right amen today
[1:04:00] look at them let me read a couple other
[1:04:02] scriptures Saint Luke Chapter uh chapter
[1:04:04] 2.
[1:04:09] now remember just as God with job
[1:04:13] took down that hedge for Satan at
[1:04:17] Satan's behest because he knew that job
[1:04:20] was going to serve him anyway right
[1:04:23] he knew he was going to
[1:04:25] and even as he took that hedge down
[1:04:31] s the truth
[1:04:33] but remember
[1:04:35] those that hedge
[1:04:37] those demons those uh excuse me those
[1:04:41] angels those Holy Angels those God the
[1:04:44] Angels those are God's behest
[1:04:47] just as the aim just as the uh the the
[1:04:51] angels that Satan has they they do
[1:04:53] what's ever the devil tells them
[1:04:57] God's angels are at his beckoning call
[1:05:01] they operate these angels operate at
[1:05:04] God's pleasure you go read
[1:05:07] you
[1:05:08] see that a lot in Revelation
[1:05:11] where God moves these angels to do
[1:05:15] certain things certain places certain
[1:05:17] times go do this go Mark these uh Isaiah
[1:05:21] go Mark these that are signing crying go
[1:05:24] to the four corners of the Earth take
[1:05:25] this Inkwell and go do this and see
[1:05:28] these angels operate at the behest of
[1:05:30] God's pleasure wherever God sends them
[1:05:33] whatever God tells them to do that's
[1:05:35] what they do and on this great day here
[1:05:38] they were they were sent to do something
[1:05:41] special Saint Luke Chapter 2
[1:05:43] verse 8
[1:05:46] Saint Luke 2 8 and there was in the same
[1:05:48] country that might sound like a
[1:05:49] Christmas story and I guess it's read a
[1:05:52] lot around Christmas but and there was
[1:05:54] in the same country shepherds abiding in
[1:05:57] the field keeping watch over their flock
[1:05:59] by nights and lo the angel of the Lord
[1:06:02] praise the Lord
[1:06:04] there he is again
[1:06:05] Came Upon them
[1:06:07] and the glory of the Lord shall round
[1:06:10] about them and they were so afraid
[1:06:13] the Angels said unto them fear not for
[1:06:16] behold I bring you good tidings of great
[1:06:19] joy which shall be to all people
[1:06:21] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[1:06:24] city of David a savior which is Christ
[1:06:26] the lord
[1:06:27] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[1:06:30] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:06:31] clothes lying in a manger and suddenly
[1:06:34] there was with the angel listen now
[1:06:37] suddenly there was with the angel a
[1:06:40] multitude of the Heavenly hosts
[1:06:42] praising God and saying glory to God in
[1:06:46] the highest and on Earth peace and Good
[1:06:49] Will towards men now what was what was
[1:06:53] this host
[1:06:55] that this scripture is talking about
[1:06:58] it it's not the same because the
[1:07:01] translation from the Greek to the Hebrew
[1:07:03] but if you go look at the definitions
[1:07:05] you'll see that this host in a lot of
[1:07:08] ways is the same hedge that job had
[1:07:12] around him
[1:07:13] this Host this host is a band of the
[1:07:17] soldiers of Heaven that were there at
[1:07:20] that time surrounding about as the angel
[1:07:23] of the Lord was there this host from
[1:07:26] heaven was there and had them surrounded
[1:07:28] about praise the Lord worshiping God
[1:07:31] giving God praise and glory this host of
[1:07:35] Heaven had come down and had visited
[1:07:38] them and was with them at that place at
[1:07:40] the behest of God at God's instructions
[1:07:44] now let's look at another time that God
[1:07:47] did the same thing second Kings chapter
[1:07:51] um chapter six
[1:07:55] let's go to Second Kings chapter six
[1:07:59] laughs
[1:08:02] II Kings chapter six
[1:08:06] it's very familiar scripture
[1:08:09] to most of us I'm sure
[1:08:12] second Kings chapter six we'll begin
[1:08:14] reading at verse 13.
[1:08:25] amen look now and he said the king said
[1:08:28] go and spy where he Elisha is
[1:08:32] that I may sin and fetch him
[1:08:35] and it was told him saying behold he is
[1:08:37] in Dothan
[1:08:39] therefore sin Heath thither horses
[1:08:41] chariots and a great host and they came
[1:08:45] by night and compassed the city about
[1:08:48] and when the sermon of the man of God
[1:08:50] gehaza
[1:08:52] was risen early and gone forth behold
[1:08:56] and host come past the city both with
[1:08:59] horses and chariots now look the enemy
[1:09:02] hasn't surrounded
[1:09:04] the enemy of God the enemy of Elisha
[1:09:08] this King that wants to take Elisha with
[1:09:11] him has his horses and chariots
[1:09:15] compassing the entire city to where
[1:09:18] there would be no Escape
[1:09:21] and his servant said unto him alas my
[1:09:24] master
[1:09:25] how shall we do
[1:09:27] and he Elisha answered fear not oh
[1:09:32] listen to this friends I love this part
[1:09:35] fear not
[1:09:37] for they that be with us
[1:09:40] are more than they that be with them
[1:09:44] amen amen praise the Lord you can always
[1:09:48] say that friend because that is always
[1:09:50] true yes it is always true that more
[1:09:53] with us than is with them remember we've
[1:09:55] already found them scripturally there's
[1:09:57] twice as many with us that are with him
[1:09:59] there's twice as many that are
[1:10:01] protecting this little bride which is a
[1:10:03] small number compared to those that are
[1:10:05] of the evil spirits that are commanding
[1:10:07] all the rest of the souls around the
[1:10:09] world billions of people yes amen more
[1:10:13] with us than there are with them but see
[1:10:15] this poor little guy this little servant
[1:10:17] gehaza he didn't know that he was only
[1:10:21] exclaiming what he could see he was only
[1:10:24] talking to Elijah about what he could
[1:10:26] actually see around him but Master they
[1:10:29] have us all surrounded what are we gonna
[1:10:31] do now
[1:10:32] he said oh it's okay because there's
[1:10:34] more with us than there are with him
[1:10:37] you imagine him sentencing
[1:10:39] one two
[1:10:43] there's more with us
[1:10:45] there's two of us and there's more with
[1:10:48] us than there are with them look out
[1:10:50] there don't you see Elisha they're all
[1:10:53] over the mountain they're all around us
[1:10:55] they've got us surrounded there's two of
[1:10:57] us what do you mean there's more with us
[1:10:58] than they're all with them and then and
[1:11:00] then Elisha says
[1:11:04] Elisha prayed it said Lord I pray thee
[1:11:07] open his eyes that he may see
[1:11:12] spiritual opening he meant a spiritual
[1:11:15] open
[1:11:15] his eyes that he may see and the Lord
[1:11:18] opened the eyes of the young man and he
[1:11:20] saw and behold the mountain was full of
[1:11:23] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[1:11:27] Elijah
[1:11:28] praise God could you imagine
[1:11:31] you imagine something like that
[1:11:32] happening I imagine maybe to some degree
[1:11:37] the scales that fall off your eyes from
[1:11:39] time to time and maybe you've seen
[1:11:40] something like that or an angel of the
[1:11:42] Lord or something I have uh it's quite
[1:11:45] an experience it's not a it's kind of
[1:11:48] like Billy I like the way Billy Paul
[1:11:50] told it when his dad uh asked change the
[1:11:53] Lord is it okay that uh Billy sees he
[1:11:55] said okay he said he went over there and
[1:11:58] he put a pillow over his face and he
[1:12:01] woke him up because he didn't want to
[1:12:02] see him right away because it can be
[1:12:05] quite startling if you've ever seen it
[1:12:07] it can be quite startling and he had a
[1:12:09] pillow of his face he woke him up and
[1:12:11] said now he's standing over in the
[1:12:12] corner and he said I gave me permission
[1:12:14] for you to see him he's Billy Paul said
[1:12:16] he got up and under the pill and he
[1:12:17] looked he said he was standing there
[1:12:19] I'll agree with his arms crossed like
[1:12:20] this
[1:12:21] and he and just in awe he just stood and
[1:12:25] that's that's exactly to me that's
[1:12:27] exactly what it is you know oh look oh
[1:12:30] wow there's that no
[1:12:31] no no no no it's not a son of that he's
[1:12:34] standing there
[1:12:36] okay kind of takes your breath away and
[1:12:39] all of a sudden we vaporize that's not
[1:12:42] what it is but
[1:12:44] it's probably the best way of saying it
[1:12:46] and then he goes and goes away and he's
[1:12:49] out the and he's gone and the presence
[1:12:53] that's left there is just it's just
[1:12:55] incredibly awe-inspiring but you imagine
[1:12:57] just that angel Lord that stand down
[1:12:59] that was assigned to brother Branham at
[1:13:02] that time let me read you something here
[1:13:05] that was with him all the time that same
[1:13:07] age of the Lord amen listen in the
[1:13:10] questions and answers 1964.
[1:13:14] question was explain about each person's
[1:13:16] Angel who abides with them from birth uh
[1:13:19] now if you notice she said this is
[1:13:20] pretty deep I pick it up now he said
[1:13:23] part of it wrote in tight and other
[1:13:25] pencil now there is an angel look at
[1:13:27] this
[1:13:29] is really incredible to me there is an
[1:13:32] angel but this Angel of the Lord that
[1:13:34] are encamped about those that fear Him
[1:13:36] see now it isn't promised to Sinners
[1:13:41] that has Angels right not promised to
[1:13:44] Sinners it's only the redeemed that has
[1:13:48] Angels yes yes amen only the redeemed
[1:13:51] that has Angels did you know that the
[1:13:53] angels of the Lord encamped about those
[1:13:55] that fear Him Now angels are messengers
[1:13:58] I want you to notice it's so perfect and
[1:14:01] I'll prove predestination to you which
[1:14:03] we've already gone through but now when
[1:14:05] a little baby is being formed under the
[1:14:07] mother's heart
[1:14:09] and you little children that understand
[1:14:11] these things see little she's trying to
[1:14:13] explain it to the little children to
[1:14:15] understand formed under the mother's
[1:14:17] heart see the Lord gives you to mother
[1:14:20] amen the Lord gives you to mother and
[1:14:24] she carries you under her heart because
[1:14:27] you're close to her heart
[1:14:30] and then one day the Lord come down and
[1:14:33] deliver you from your mother's heart
[1:14:35] from away from her heart but you'll
[1:14:38] always be in her heart
[1:14:41] amen that
[1:14:43] that presence of that angel
[1:14:46] and he goes on to talk about how that
[1:14:48] angel is there waiting for that bird to
[1:14:51] come forth and it's with that person all
[1:14:53] their lives and that person that angel
[1:14:56] that was there with brother Branham he
[1:14:58] allowed his son to see that angel
[1:15:00] because he worked so close of course
[1:15:02] with his dad and all the Miracles and
[1:15:03] things that happened and he saw that
[1:15:05] angel of the Lord that had been there
[1:15:07] with him and he it grips you to
[1:15:11] understand
[1:15:12] what goes on when when gehaza when God
[1:15:17] opened his eyes and he saw these
[1:15:19] Chariots of Fire horses and Chariots of
[1:15:22] Fire all around he could recognize yes
[1:15:25] there are more with us than there are
[1:15:27] with them amen amen but there was no
[1:15:31] great huge battle ensued friends there
[1:15:34] was no great Showdown right there where
[1:15:36] they locked horns and swords and fought
[1:15:39] to the death they just came down and
[1:15:42] Elisha just said blind the Lord
[1:15:44] now he opened spiritually the eyes of
[1:15:48] gehaza by the prayer of Elisha and he
[1:15:51] closed physically the eyes of these men
[1:15:54] who come to take Elisha away
[1:15:56] blind them Lord and those men come in
[1:15:59] there and and Elisha lies to him
[1:16:03] just true he tells them oh I'm not him
[1:16:05] but I can show you where he is come
[1:16:07] follow me and he takes them all the way
[1:16:09] down to another city
[1:16:11] he takes them all the way down into this
[1:16:14] other city and he said he's the one
[1:16:15] they're looking for but they can't see
[1:16:18] him if they can't know who he is because
[1:16:20] God blinded their eyes and he takes them
[1:16:23] into a whole other city and he says Lord
[1:16:25] open their eyes
[1:16:27] and they're looking around and they're
[1:16:28] in the middle of this whole other city
[1:16:30] and what's going on what just happened
[1:16:33] but God but in Elijah pray said God
[1:16:36] should we should I slay them should I
[1:16:38] just kill them no give them bread and
[1:16:40] water and send them back to their Master
[1:16:41] amen it was no great battle ensue he
[1:16:44] gave him bread water fed him sent him
[1:16:46] back off to their master of course they
[1:16:49] went back and told the master and uh any
[1:16:52] normal rational uh common thinking man
[1:16:55] would say okay I don't want nothing to
[1:16:56] do with that guy uh we'll just let him
[1:16:59] stay uh we'll just be who we are just
[1:17:02] leave things alone but those angels that
[1:17:05] were there they encamped around about
[1:17:07] see they don't leave you think well they
[1:17:10] were there for that occasion you know
[1:17:11] they're
[1:17:13] there and that angel that God has that's
[1:17:16] with you my dad
[1:17:17] oh this is going to sound bad but my dad
[1:17:20] was a problem he wasn't ashamed of it
[1:17:21] because he when he was a little boy he
[1:17:24] always knew there was an angel with him
[1:17:25] amen amen I can't say that my son could
[1:17:29] at the times the pain so Lord helped him
[1:17:32] but my dad knew when he was a little boy
[1:17:35] there was an angel with him he called
[1:17:36] him Spike
[1:17:38] I that sounds crude I know but he didn't
[1:17:41] know he's just a little boy he named his
[1:17:42] Angel Spike and his whole life he would
[1:17:44] become a Christian and and he got the
[1:17:46] Holy Ghost he still called his Angel
[1:17:47] Spike but that angel that follows all
[1:17:50] the way through life she's unbelievers
[1:17:52] they're not promised that but the but
[1:17:55] the believer is promised that see they
[1:17:57] don't leave friend God has his angels
[1:18:00] his protection Brigade his hedge
[1:18:04] continuously around you yes I pray that
[1:18:07] all the time for you as a conversation
[1:18:09] as each one of us as a congregation that
[1:18:11] God keep his hands around us protected
[1:18:14] from all the things that goes on around
[1:18:16] the world today and the germs diseases
[1:18:18] afflictions and all the stuff that's
[1:18:20] happening around the evil spirits The
[1:18:22] Wiles of the devil keep them protected
[1:18:24] Lord keep those Holy Angels around with
[1:18:28] flaming swords drunk that when that
[1:18:30] demon tries to penetrate that he'll walk
[1:18:33] away
[1:18:35] amen is that
[1:18:37] Vagabond you did an Acts
[1:18:40] he walks right away from those angels
[1:18:43] wounded because those angels are there
[1:18:45] to protect you to keep you to watch over
[1:18:48] you during this period of time when all
[1:18:50] these things are going to understand
[1:18:51] Saints and these demons are real
[1:18:55] Spirits are real amen they don't just go
[1:18:58] away that we talk about the Holy Angels
[1:19:01] these ain't these these Spirits they're
[1:19:04] they're real they Spirits don't die we
[1:19:07] know they don't die right look let's
[1:19:08] let's let me read this I was going to
[1:19:10] skip over this
[1:19:12] but let me read this I got one more
[1:19:14] scripture we'll close here after this
[1:19:16] and in Matthew chapter 8 I like this
[1:19:19] scripture
[1:19:20] let's go to Matthew chapter eight we'll
[1:19:22] begin reading it the verse 28.
[1:19:25] but but I like this scripture I know uh
[1:19:28] I believe Mark and Luke had the same
[1:19:30] story they tell a little bit differently
[1:19:32] and they put a little more verbage of
[1:19:33] Jesus in it but Matthew tells it my
[1:19:37] favorite way so I read Matthew's account
[1:19:39] of it when he's coming across to the
[1:19:41] country of the gurga scenes
[1:19:44] however that's pronounced
[1:19:46] uh a fantastic thing happens to help us
[1:19:51] kind of understand the spirit world and
[1:19:53] what goes on the spirit world and
[1:19:54] understand these Spirits don't die
[1:19:56] remember when brother Noel was here he
[1:19:58] kind of I didn't print it but he kind of
[1:20:01] gave that uh that's that quote of when
[1:20:04] brother Branham was talking about uh
[1:20:07] this person has this and this person
[1:20:09] over here has that same thing and and in
[1:20:12] the presence of God these two demonic
[1:20:15] spirits that have these people bound
[1:20:16] down they're starting to scream out at
[1:20:19] each other saying what are we going to
[1:20:21] do how are we going to keep from going
[1:20:23] because they were afraid of what was
[1:20:25] about to happen and friend these demonic
[1:20:28] spirits should be shaking in their
[1:20:30] booths every single time your eyes open
[1:20:32] in the morning
[1:20:34] they should be afraid and scared every
[1:20:37] single breath you draw every time your
[1:20:39] heart beats those devils are trembling
[1:20:41] because you're a child of God yes you
[1:20:44] are the worst thing that they have ever
[1:20:46] tried to come against yes because they
[1:20:49] know that you are impenetrable
[1:20:51] God has a hedge first and greater is he
[1:20:55] that's in US
[1:20:56] amen job could not say that greater was
[1:21:00] not in job at that time but now him in
[1:21:03] US is greater now than
[1:21:05] that then that is in the world yeah yeah
[1:21:08] praise the Lord they're scared
[1:21:12] I I'm sure if you could just Lord let me
[1:21:16] tap into a conversation between the
[1:21:19] devil and one of his minions just one
[1:21:21] time
[1:21:23] and Satan says go to sister so and so go
[1:21:26] to brother sauce I was just there Satan
[1:21:29] go again and do this I tried it it
[1:21:31] didn't work but do it again well the
[1:21:34] last time you you remember that big gash
[1:21:36] I had in me that came from her
[1:21:39] you know that that's a a leg that was
[1:21:42] broke that was him I don't want to go
[1:21:44] back over there and get beat up again I
[1:21:47] said go
[1:21:48] that demon goes but he comes back to
[1:21:50] that brother that sister and walks away
[1:21:52] just as wounded maybe a gash in the
[1:21:55] skull this time I know I'm talking
[1:21:57] naturally friend on a spiritual warfare
[1:21:59] but you understand what I'm saying yeah
[1:22:02] yeah that demon will go back to Satan C
[1:22:05] I told you devil I don't want to go back
[1:22:07] over to her again
[1:22:09] wounded naked
[1:22:11] because of a son or daughter of God that
[1:22:15] by faith caring and wielding this sword
[1:22:18] defeats that enemy every time
[1:22:20] praise God
[1:22:22] look at this in Matthew 8 28
[1:22:26] and when he come to the other side into
[1:22:28] the country of the gurga scene
[1:22:31] there met him too possessed with Devils
[1:22:33] coming out of the tombs
[1:22:37] exceeding Fierce so that no man might
[1:22:40] pass that way now these are some pretty
[1:22:43] rough devils
[1:22:45] nobody would even go buy them
[1:22:48] just for their presence being there
[1:22:51] the same thing happened today for
[1:22:52] instance people that and you know what
[1:22:55] you better not confront any of those
[1:22:56] Spirits unless you know where you stand
[1:22:58] with the Lord
[1:22:59] that you don't that's not something that
[1:23:02] you play with
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:04] bye-bye
[1:23:06] and behold they cried out saying what
[1:23:09] have we to do with thee Jesus now look
[1:23:11] Jesus according to Matthew's account
[1:23:13] which I told you I like his account
[1:23:15] better Jesus hasn't said a word his mere
[1:23:18] presence walking off the boat enlisted
[1:23:22] this conversation just like the ones
[1:23:24] when brother and Adam was standing there
[1:23:25] and those demons are straining and
[1:23:27] crying out to each other
[1:23:29] of course you know in the name of Jesus
[1:23:32] in the name of Jesus and those demons
[1:23:34] had to go
[1:23:35] same thing here it lives in a
[1:23:38] conversation Jesus didn't say anything
[1:23:40] but the demons are crying out Jesus thou
[1:23:44] Son of God Art Thou come hither to
[1:23:47] torment us before the time
[1:23:49] and there was a good way off from them I
[1:23:51] heard of many swine feeding so the
[1:23:54] Devils the disabled the devil's besought
[1:23:56] him now they're asking they're begging
[1:23:58] they're praying they're not praying but
[1:24:00] they're they're begging Jesus
[1:24:04] uh the devil's besought him that is
[1:24:07] today really
[1:24:09] saying if thou cast us out suffer us to
[1:24:13] go away into the herd of swine now
[1:24:15] they've already recognized Jesus and his
[1:24:18] presence they have already acknowledged
[1:24:20] that he is greater than them and now
[1:24:23] they're acknowledging Jesus if you're
[1:24:25] going to cast us out which was
[1:24:27] inevitable they just said they're
[1:24:29] already they're already speaking their
[1:24:31] demise and Jesus hadn't said a single
[1:24:34] word
[1:24:36] his presence
[1:24:38] Jesus mere presence has got these Devils
[1:24:43] so afraid they've already spoken their
[1:24:46] demise
[1:24:47] now they don't die but they left the
[1:24:50] people that they were in
[1:24:52] if you're gonna cast us out cast us into
[1:24:54] those pigs over there
[1:24:57] and he said unto them one two letter
[1:24:59] word
[1:25:00] go
[1:25:02] amen go
[1:25:05] how many hours
[1:25:07] how many altars how much oil
[1:25:11] how much time and prayer has been how
[1:25:14] much yelling screaming has gone on to
[1:25:17] try to cast out devil
[1:25:19] when all Jesus did was say go
[1:25:24] amen it's the life behind the name
[1:25:26] Saints yes
[1:25:28] there was no oil pouring
[1:25:30] there was no laying on of hands there
[1:25:33] was no screaming no yelling no punching
[1:25:35] no shouting
[1:25:36] one two letter words go
[1:25:40] and that's all it took
[1:25:42] Jesus said one two letter word go and
[1:25:45] those demons had to flee
[1:25:47] and when he said go they were come out
[1:25:50] of those men they went into the heart of
[1:25:53] swine and behold the whole herd of swine
[1:25:56] ran violently down a steep Place into
[1:25:59] the sea and perished in the waters
[1:26:02] it was such a spectacle to those that
[1:26:05] were attending to the to the swine that
[1:26:08] they ran back into the City and they
[1:26:10] asked Jesus that he would leave
[1:26:13] he delivers these men
[1:26:16] of these demonic spirits because see the
[1:26:19] spirits don't die they went from here
[1:26:20] went into the swine doesn't say where
[1:26:23] they went after the swine but it was
[1:26:25] such a a a spectacle to the people there
[1:26:29] they asked Jesus to leave after that
[1:26:33] can you imagine I would think oh let's
[1:26:35] keep him around a while he delivered
[1:26:37] these of their of those demonic spirits
[1:26:40] mine
[1:26:41] mine but it's the same though it's the
[1:26:44] same thing today
[1:26:46] people fear the supernatural a lot of
[1:26:49] times people fear the supernatural the
[1:26:52] moving of the spirit and the power of
[1:26:54] the Holy Ghost amen people feared it's
[1:26:57] the same thing today Amen to do the same
[1:26:59] way
[1:27:01] amen I got one more scripture I want to
[1:27:03] read and we'll close
[1:27:05] first John
[1:27:06] chapter 4 goes along with our song
[1:27:14] first John chapter 4.
[1:27:17] we'll begin with verse one
[1:27:20] beloved
[1:27:22] believe not every spirit
[1:27:25] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:27:28] God
[1:27:28] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:27:31] into the world because remember it would
[1:27:33] be these Spirits would be so close now
[1:27:36] the spirits aren't closed but the way
[1:27:38] they conduct themselves and act
[1:27:40] will look so close that it would deceive
[1:27:44] the very elect if it were possible the
[1:27:46] spirits aren't closed they're vastly
[1:27:48] different
[1:27:49] but they'll act they'll pretend to be so
[1:27:54] close there that they'll look like the
[1:27:56] real thing when they're really not right
[1:27:58] amen
[1:28:02] because many false prophets are going
[1:28:04] out into the world
[1:28:06] hereby know ye the spirit of God every
[1:28:09] spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
[1:28:11] has come in the flesh is of God and
[1:28:13] every spirit that confesseth not that
[1:28:15] Jesus Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[1:28:18] is not of God and that is that Spirit of
[1:28:21] antichrist wherever you have heard that
[1:28:23] it should come and even now already is
[1:28:26] it in the world
[1:28:27] ye are of God now he's talking about
[1:28:30] those evil spirits now he's talking
[1:28:31] about the good the spirits the Holy
[1:28:34] Spirit
[1:28:36] year of God little children
[1:28:39] and have overcome them
[1:28:41] because greater is he that is in you
[1:28:45] is in the world
[1:28:47] praise the Lord greater season
[1:28:53] is is of course greater than the spirit
[1:28:55] is in the world but we also need to
[1:28:57] continue to remember just as the
[1:28:58] anointing of God is is a variation or
[1:29:02] different from the indwelling presence
[1:29:04] of Christ in your soul that anointing is
[1:29:06] just as important as your life is well
[1:29:09] not just as important but it's very
[1:29:11] important most important thing is you're
[1:29:13] born again and there's nothing to
[1:29:15] compare to that but that anointing in
[1:29:17] your life is is extremely important as
[1:29:21] well amen that that uh that presence of
[1:29:24] God that's not just in you but around
[1:29:26] you that is that is with us
[1:29:30] remember when he came on the day of
[1:29:32] Pentecost he came first with them
[1:29:35] and then in them
[1:29:38] praise the Lord so I had to be an
[1:29:40] anointing of the presence of the holy
[1:29:42] spirit with you to come and then
[1:29:46] in you
[1:29:47] and in that presence of God in you that
[1:29:49] of course that change
[1:29:51] when it's the anointing around it
[1:29:52] changes everything around you
[1:29:54] so it's very important to remember these
[1:29:57] angels of God though we may not be able
[1:29:59] to see them we may not be able to feel
[1:30:01] them
[1:30:02] or hear them we know that they're there
[1:30:05] we know that by faith the angels of God
[1:30:08] are encamped around about us because we
[1:30:11] fear him because we love him we Revere
[1:30:14] him God is our absolute he's our
[1:30:17] everything he's our typos he's our all
[1:30:19] in all so
[1:30:21] we know that when he protects and keeps
[1:30:23] and hedges us
[1:30:25] just like he hedged job
[1:30:28] just like he came when yahayza couldn't
[1:30:31] see them and Elisha was it looked like
[1:30:34] they were in trouble God was always
[1:30:35] there
[1:30:36] amen God was always there and the
[1:30:40] deepest darkest and the lowest of The
[1:30:41] Valleys God is always still there when
[1:30:44] it looks like there's no way out when it
[1:30:46] looks impossible and penetrable God is
[1:30:48] always there the angels of God are still
[1:30:50] in protection
[1:30:52] amen and I told you I pray for you amen
[1:30:55] those angels those flaming swords drawn
[1:30:58] to keep protection to keep you protected
[1:31:01] Amen to watch over us and to keep those
[1:31:04] Satan couldn't get by jobs he can't get
[1:31:08] by yours unless just like he did
[1:31:10] eventually with job he said okay I'll
[1:31:12] take down the Hedge okay Angels move out
[1:31:15] from around job but or move move out
[1:31:18] from what he really did is move out from
[1:31:20] around all that is jobs
[1:31:22] but stay with Joe because the direction
[1:31:26] from God to Satan was you can touch
[1:31:28] anything job has but don't touch him
[1:31:31] right
[1:31:32] so he instructed all those that around
[1:31:34] all that he has okay uh
[1:31:37] you can relax in and go away allow Satan
[1:31:41] and Satan came in and he took the
[1:31:43] animals he took the buildings he took
[1:31:44] these his children and all those things
[1:31:47] but he couldn't touch job
[1:31:49] and then the second time he came back
[1:31:51] and God said okay I'll take the heads
[1:31:53] down from job now you can touch him you
[1:31:55] can touch his flesh but you can't take
[1:31:57] his life so we know of course then boils
[1:32:00] in the head from his head to his feet
[1:32:02] and all that Satan did to job there amen
[1:32:05] because God because those angels had
[1:32:07] your protection had to follow the
[1:32:10] instructions whatever God told them they
[1:32:12] operated the pleasure of God yes
[1:32:14] whatever he told them and they had to
[1:32:16] then they had to disperse and go and
[1:32:19] then when it came to job but they could
[1:32:21] not take he could Satan could not take
[1:32:23] his life
[1:32:24] amen and job never did Curse God
[1:32:27] never did charge him foolishly yes he
[1:32:30] even told his wife who had been pushed
[1:32:33] over into the marginal colony of of
[1:32:36] unbelief
[1:32:38] you speak like a foolish woman
[1:32:41] you speak like an unbeliever
[1:32:44] God gives God takes away he's still God
[1:32:47] he's God on the mountain he's God in the
[1:32:49] valley he's the same God when I'm in
[1:32:52] perfect health he's the same God when
[1:32:54] I'm feeling under the weather he's same
[1:32:56] Godwin I don't have a dollar in my bank
[1:32:58] account he's saying God if I had a
[1:33:00] billion he's saying God doesn't change
[1:33:02] and he's the same God to me
[1:33:05] praise the Lord and he's here now saying
[1:33:08] praise the Lord is here now we believe
[1:33:11] amen we believe in faith praise the Lord
[1:33:13] let's stand if we could
[1:33:21] praise the Lord I believe he's obviously
[1:33:25] the Lord pleased yes
