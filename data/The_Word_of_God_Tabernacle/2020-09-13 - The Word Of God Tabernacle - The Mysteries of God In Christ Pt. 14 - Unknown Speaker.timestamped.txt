[40:52] providing us this place and
[40:54] uh for each one of you coming and being
[40:55] a participant there and
[40:57] just trust to be a blessing to you today
[40:59] a few things i wanted to mention to you
[41:01] um that i will now and then probably
[41:04] some after
[41:05] the service is over but remember if you
[41:08] need to use the restroom i
[41:09] prefer only going if you really have to
[41:12] but if you really have to
[41:13] through the door and the other door
[41:15] inside there's the restroom
[41:17] also as a reminder
[41:21] and for those who are watching when you
[41:23] come to the assembly here
[41:25] we're welcome to park in front of the
[41:27] church and we're welcome to park on the
[41:29] south side of the church at this
[41:31] school that's for this for sale right
[41:33] here they have a whole big parking lot
[41:34] over here
[41:35] you're welcome to park in the back of
[41:36] the church which we open the gates if
[41:38] you want to go around back there
[41:40] but do not park at the one on the north
[41:43] side
[41:43] the building on the north side that
[41:46] gentleman has
[41:47] requested we not park in his parking
[41:49] spaces even though they're not open on
[41:51] sunday
[41:51] he requests that we not park over there
[41:53] so don't park over there
[41:55] but you're welcome to park in front on
[41:57] the south side or in the back
[41:59] so if you do that if you do and please
[42:03] listen to this very closely and those
[42:04] who may
[42:05] come eventually there's a few that
[42:07] weren't here last week so
[42:09] god bless you appreciate you being here
[42:11] love y'all
[42:13] the the driveway between this
[42:16] church and the school building looks
[42:19] like you can drive through it but
[42:21] don't because between our property
[42:24] and the next property there's a huge dip
[42:28] and if you try to go over that you may
[42:30] rip out the
[42:32] the bottom of your car so don't try to
[42:35] go
[42:35] if you need to go from this parking lot
[42:37] to the one next door
[42:39] or from the one next door to this
[42:41] parking lot don't go through that little
[42:43] area right there go back out on the
[42:44] street
[42:45] if you have to because that if you go
[42:48] dip through there
[42:49] i put a comb right there to try to hope
[42:51] to keep people from going through there
[42:53] so
[42:54] just to let you know and let those hook
[42:56] up know
[42:57] on the streaming if you do come don't
[43:00] try to go from this parking lot to that
[43:01] parking lot without going back on the
[43:03] street because
[43:04] your live will tear your car up so just
[43:06] a
[43:07] word of wisdom to let you know brother
[43:09] roger found that out the hard way
[43:12] his car's okay but he bottomed out
[43:14] pretty heavy when he tried to go from
[43:16] this parking lot to the next one over so
[43:19] just remember that come and there's
[43:22] plenty of parking especially if it's on
[43:24] the south side
[43:24] so there's way more parking than what we
[43:27] actually have seats in here
[43:28] also if you if you
[43:32] feel like you need it and you're on the
[43:35] streaming and you want to come or feel
[43:37] like you need it
[43:38] we have chairs on the side over here we
[43:40] have chairs on the side over here and i
[43:41] got some of my stuff over here and
[43:43] mike has got some of his stuff over
[43:45] there but we can move that stuff
[43:47] if you feel like you want to be a need
[43:48] to be more socially distanced
[43:51] you're welcome to sit over there or over
[43:53] there uh
[43:54] if it's a problem and a concern and
[43:56] you've thought about coming and you
[43:57] haven't come
[43:58] yet we do have chairs over here over
[44:01] here that you can be
[44:02] apart a little bit more so just
[44:05] so that you all know that and if you
[44:07] want to do that feel welcome to
[44:09] um i just left my thing there because
[44:12] nobody was
[44:13] look like everybody's comfortable and
[44:14] said where they're setting so i just
[44:16] left my thing over there but if anybody
[44:18] wants to
[44:19] or if you want to come and feel more
[44:21] comfortable coming you're welcome to do
[44:23] that
[44:23] so appreciate all your goodness
[44:26] the lord and all your blessings to us so
[44:29] there's a few other things i want to
[44:30] mention but i'm going to do that after
[44:32] the service so
[44:33] let's uh let's stand to our feet if we
[44:36] could
[44:39] amen
[44:46] and i have to mention again i really
[44:49] really do appreciate
[44:51] uh daniel making this pulpit for us um
[44:54] sister normal is kind of concerned that
[44:56] we wouldn't like it and it wasn't
[44:57] exactly the picture i sent
[44:59] but i really like it i really do uh like
[45:01] i told you last week brother roger found
[45:03] this
[45:04] observant first of all that the the
[45:06] three steps of grace in the bottom
[45:07] coming into the cross and
[45:09] then i said yeah they come the cross
[45:10] then comes right up to the word so
[45:13] he was inspired when he made this i like
[45:16] the bigness of this and uh
[45:18] it's uh it's a real blessing praise the
[45:20] lord if i want me a shelf sister
[45:22] normally just put one right here
[45:24] maybe eventually we'll see what happens
[45:26] there but
[45:28] that's okay i like i love it i like it
[45:31] the way it is it's really
[45:32] nice i would like to have a place to put
[45:34] more water or something
[45:35] it's it's a real blessing so um
[45:38] and a few of the things about i want to
[45:40] talk to you about but we'll do that
[45:41] afterwards so we'll get to the word now
[45:43] revelation chapter 10 we're going to go
[45:46] back oh there's one other thing i meant
[45:47] to mention um
[45:50] if the lights are too bright for someone
[45:52] just let me know
[45:54] we're eventually supposed to put these
[45:57] five lights here brother roger put these
[45:59] lights in for
[46:00] the streaming because that's what he
[46:02] does
[46:03] so to note cast no shadows to look nicer
[46:06] and for people
[46:07] for it to be more presentable he put
[46:09] these lights here
[46:10] uh so it it is a little bright i like it
[46:13] okay but if it's too bright for you
[46:15] we put two lights on one circuit one
[46:18] light on another circuit and two more
[46:19] lights on them so there's three
[46:21] there's three circuits over there we're
[46:22] gonna put a sound booth back there but
[46:24] there's three back there
[46:25] we can turn one or two of those off if
[46:27] it's too bright we just turn this middle
[46:29] one off or something
[46:30] just let me know so if it's something
[46:32] that uh like last time we were at that
[46:35] church and those lights
[46:36] bothered some people so we just kept
[46:38] them all so if it bothers you
[46:39] let me know we can alter it and we can
[46:41] change it so
[46:42] if it becomes an issue we're going to go
[46:44] back or go back
[46:46] into the mysteries of god in christ
[46:48] we're in part 14 now
[46:50] and uh begin our scripture reading with
[46:53] revelation chapter 10 verse 7 as we have
[46:56] uh for uh every other portion of this
[46:59] uh that we've been doing so revelation
[47:02] 10 7 well let's just bow our heads
[47:04] just talk to the father of the word one
[47:05] more time if we could

[47:44] to call your name

[47:56] it's probably almost common to us but
[47:58] there's people there's our brothers and
[48:00] sisters around the world
[48:02] that may be challenged to be able to do
[48:04] that and we're so thankful
[48:06] that we live in a place as as

[49:22] part of this
[49:23] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[49:25] christ and for your glory and honor we
[49:27] pray
[49:28] amen amen revelation 10 7
[49:31] let's read this again before you see it
[49:33] but in the days of the voice of the
[49:34] seventh angel
[49:35] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[49:37] of god should be finished
[49:39] as he had declared to his servants the
[49:41] prophets
[49:42] you can be seated if you'd like as i
[49:45] said we're on part 14
[49:47] of the mysteries of god in christ and
[49:49] last week we
[49:50] finished up uh i don't think you could
[49:53] ever finish up but i feel like we came
[49:55] to a completion
[49:56] of what the lord had given me on god
[49:59] having the preeminence in his people
[50:02] so this would be the restoration of his
[50:04] kingdom
[50:05] part one so we're on the mysteries of
[50:08] god in christ
[50:09] the restoration of his kingdom now
[50:11] that's not exactly the way brother
[50:13] branham put it
[50:14] as i'll read that quote in just a minute
[50:15] but that's the way i wanted to put it
[50:17] for my
[50:18] titling of this subtitle i wanted to put
[50:21] it's the restoration of
[50:22] his kingdom amen we are subject of his
[50:25] kingdom
[50:26] we are here because this is his kingdom
[50:28] his kingdom is in
[50:30] us praise the lord so that restoration
[50:33] of his kingdom
[50:34] part one amen that's where we're at
[50:36] today so i want to go
[50:38] over to saint matthew now chapter six
[50:45] to help the lord we'll just try to lay a
[50:46] little bit of a foundation here
[50:49] um maybe not be quite as long as we were
[50:51] last week i don't think we were too long
[50:53] last week but
[50:54] i wanted to try to finish up what we had
[50:57] there to be done i didn't want to leave
[50:59] anything over in today but i will hit
[51:02] some highlights from
[51:04] last week maybe the last couple services
[51:06] or so
[51:07] as we transition into this restoration
[51:10] of his kingdom because remember
[51:12] this mysteries of god in christ or
[51:14] christ christ the mystery of god
[51:15] revealed
[51:16] brother branham brought brought out or
[51:18] broke down into a three-part
[51:20] process of god revealing himself to his
[51:24] people god having the preeminence in his
[51:26] people and god restoring
[51:28] his kingdom so those three parts we're
[51:30] on back actually the third part of that
[51:32] now
[51:33] and trying to finish this up the lord
[51:35] give us help today
[51:36] matthew chapter 6 we're going to read
[51:39] and remember
[51:40] this is the restoration of his kingdom
[51:43] as we begin to read here matthew 6
[51:45] chapter 8 but not be not ye therefore
[51:48] like unto them for your father knoweth
[51:51] what things you have need of
[51:52] before you ask him but yet he still asks
[51:56] us
[51:56] to ask amen right he asks us to ask even
[51:59] though
[52:00] he knows what we need we still he asked
[52:02] us to ask
[52:03] because what we do is when we ask we ask
[52:06] in faith
[52:07] and that's the thing that god gets us to
[52:09] the place of understanding is that we
[52:11] have the faith that we need to have
[52:13] because this whole life
[52:15] and this whole existence is by faith
[52:18] uh what we do how we believe how we
[52:22] live where we're going a rapture right
[52:25] it's gotta be by
[52:26] by faith it's gotta be rapturing faith
[52:28] and faith comes by hearing
[52:29] the word so uh if that word is spoken by
[52:33] any human lips when it is heard it
[52:35] brings faith
[52:36] so he knows all things but yet he asks
[52:38] us to ask so he has
[52:40] uh he he knows what things we need
[52:43] before we ask him
[52:44] after this manner now the lord's prayer
[52:46] after this manner therefore
[52:48] pray ye our father which art in heaven
[52:51] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[52:54] thy will be done in earth
[52:56] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[52:59] daily bread and forgive not our debts as
[53:01] we
[53:01] forgive our debtors lead us not into
[53:04] temptation but deliver us from
[53:06] evil for thine is the kingdom and the
[53:09] power
[53:09] and the glory forever amen
[53:13] for if you forgive men their trespasses
[53:15] your heavenly father will also forgive
[53:17] you but if you forgive not men their
[53:19] trespasses
[53:20] neither will your father forgive your
[53:22] trespasses
[53:24] now let's drop down one more scripture
[53:26] thirty-third verse
[53:27] same chapter 33rd verse but seek ye
[53:31] first
[53:31] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[53:35] and all these things shall be added unto
[53:37] you
[53:38] amen now um we're gonna come back to
[53:42] that
[53:43] so we just came through
[53:47] um the second part of christ from
[53:49] history god revealed god
[53:50] having the preeminence in his people
[53:53] there's a reason that god wanted to
[53:55] first reveal himself or make himself
[53:58] known to his people
[54:00] and that's was so that he could have the
[54:02] preeminence in his people
[54:04] and god having the preeminence in his
[54:06] people
[54:07] he wanted to have preeminence in his
[54:09] people so he could express himself
[54:11] through her
[54:12] jesus wanting to be the bride being the
[54:16] full expression
[54:17] as we've said several times in this the
[54:19] full expression
[54:20] of jesus christ on the earth today right
[54:23] now we
[54:24] know that is to bring about the purpose
[54:26] that god has and the reason
[54:27] that god is doing what he's doing to
[54:29] finish this all up
[54:31] amen god started it it's his work so he
[54:34] has to finish it
[54:35] you know that's that's the bible said if
[54:37] god started to work then it's up to him
[54:39] to keep it
[54:40] and if he keeps it it's up to him to
[54:42] finish it so this is his work
[54:44] but we're his subjects here to help get
[54:46] this completed
[54:48] to become the full expression of jesus
[54:50] christ
[54:51] so that we can finish that that god has
[54:54] that he wants to do there's things that
[54:56] we know that's still in the scripture
[54:58] there's things that we know maybe in our
[55:00] lives or others lives that
[55:02] maybe yet still need to be finished
[55:04] expressed
[55:06] well we're here for that purpose god
[55:08] help and use me
[55:09] for whatever that purpose is god helping
[55:11] you is you for whatever that purpose god
[55:13] helping use your watching today
[55:15] god help us all to be able to fulfill
[55:17] that purpose whatever it is but then
[55:20] when god fulfills that
[55:21] once god has that second eve
[55:25] restored this bride restored back
[55:29] once she's been come to that full
[55:32] expression
[55:33] then god can have or begin bring back to
[55:37] the full restoration of his kingdom
[55:39] again
[55:40] see it could not have been the full
[55:42] restoration of that
[55:44] kingdom until god brought the full
[55:46] restoration of his bride back to where
[55:48] it's supposed to be
[55:50] so in the second eve his bride today
[55:52] this gentile bride
[55:54] is restored to that place of the full
[55:56] expression
[55:57] then god could begin to as she already
[55:59] began
[56:00] but bring about the restoration of his
[56:03] kingdom back into his proper position
[56:05] again
[56:06] now you notice that uh that that
[56:09] he began and we're going to go into
[56:11] genesis and read there for a minute but
[56:12] you know what
[56:13] when when god began this he he he
[56:16] started this
[56:17] uh in motion back right after the fall
[56:21] so as it began in motion there it came
[56:24] through and of course we had
[56:26] uh the restoration of that that male
[56:29] subject adam uh jesus christ being that
[56:32] second adam
[56:34] then god had to bring about that uh that
[56:37] restoration of that woman eve that
[56:40] his bride to bring her back to that
[56:42] restoration
[56:44] and now that's come to the place of
[56:45] fruition that's come to the place of
[56:48] actuality jesus has come and that full
[56:50] restoration of that has taken place
[56:53] he has come back in us to bring the full
[56:55] restoration expression of himself
[56:58] through a bride today that has happened
[57:00] so what has come
[57:01] so after that has happened what's this
[57:03] next part to happen
[57:05] we are not in the kingdom of god as far
[57:08] as a physical
[57:09] kingdom is concerned but we are still in
[57:12] satan's eden
[57:13] so what is the restoration that is to
[57:15] take place now
[57:16] after he's done the first two parts is
[57:18] to restore back
[57:20] that kingdom to the place that it was
[57:23] back in the garden of eden
[57:24] people fuss and yelling i've heard
[57:26] people argue about
[57:28] uh we're not going back to pentecost yet
[57:30] we're going back to pentecost friend i'm
[57:31] going back to the beginning
[57:33] i'm going back where all of this started
[57:36] where god is restoring the bride back to
[57:38] the proper position
[57:40] that she was supposed to be when god
[57:41] created the whole thing in the beginning
[57:44] that's where this restoration is taking
[57:46] us with this last
[57:47] part and we read last week romans 8 23
[57:50] i believe it was that that full
[57:52] redemption is by the red
[57:54] this full completion restoration is by
[57:57] the redemption of our bodies
[58:00] amen and then god of course we know what
[58:02] happens after that and
[58:03] armageddon sets in although you can look
[58:05] in california you think carmen
[58:07] armageddon's already set in but just uh
[58:10] states and places under judgment but
[58:12] anyway uh armageddon sets in and then
[58:15] millennium
[58:15] and the gog and magog and the white
[58:19] throne judgment and new city the new
[58:21] jerusalem and that
[58:22] completion of that full restoration of
[58:24] that physical place that god has for us
[58:26] amen because remember the millennium is
[58:29] a place that god makes all things that
[58:31] were wrong here
[58:32] he makes right it's that one 000 year
[58:35] that
[58:36] that crushes finally the curse
[58:39] of the original sin in the garden of
[58:41] eden no man has lived
[58:43] one full day a thousand years since that
[58:47] original sin curse in the beginning and
[58:49] it's to bring back
[58:51] the place of peace and love and unity on
[58:54] this
[58:55] on this earth uh that that's been
[58:58] missing ever since the fall took place
[59:02] the way things are going today uh me and
[59:05] brother roger was talking the other day
[59:06] and
[59:07] and and you know we were lamenting about
[59:11] a lot of stuff that's going on and
[59:13] and the way people were acting and and i
[59:15] looked at him and i said but you know i
[59:17] can't
[59:18] i can't fault a person for
[59:21] wanting a utopia uh and that's what a
[59:25] lot that's what these people that's what
[59:26] a lot of them are striving for they're
[59:28] striving for utopia
[59:29] they just don't know you're not going to
[59:31] get it here right and they go about
[59:33] achieving it the wrong way
[59:35] but i don't blame a person for wanting
[59:37] to reach that place of
[59:39] of utopia because that's in every soul
[59:42] every soul every person as a soul we're
[59:44] 10 million worlds that soul has a desire
[59:47] because it came from somewhere and it
[59:49] has a desire to get back there
[59:50] just if they're not predestined they
[59:52] don't know and they can't get back to
[59:54] that place
[59:54] they do everything else to try to
[59:56] substitute for it so i don't blame
[59:58] somebody
[59:59] for wanting to have a place of utopia
[1:00:02] it's just not going to be here
[1:00:04] well it'll be here but it won't be in
[1:00:06] its current condition it won't be in
[1:00:07] satan's eaton
[1:00:08] it'll be in a restored kingdom right in
[1:00:11] god's kingdom
[1:00:12] praise the lord it won't be the way it
[1:00:13] is today amen but notice that god had to
[1:00:17] bring back to reach back into that
[1:00:19] expression of the bride
[1:00:20] god had to bring that bride up to that
[1:00:22] place of full expression
[1:00:24] and hopefully we understood that
[1:00:26] hopefully you can place yourself in that
[1:00:29] position
[1:00:30] of that expression because we got to
[1:00:32] understand what part we play in this
[1:00:34] we gotta this bride has got to come to
[1:00:36] play she knows who she is
[1:00:37] that's exactly what she is she's him and
[1:00:40] fletch
[1:00:41] she is him in flesh manifested is
[1:00:44] pressed in flesh today
[1:00:46] that's what you are and that's the job
[1:00:48] that we have to do
[1:00:49] that's god's choice to bring about and
[1:00:52] express
[1:00:53] a restoration of that kingdom now
[1:00:56] let me read this amen because we are
[1:00:59] headed for that utopia
[1:01:01] amen but that perfect city is not the
[1:01:04] millennium
[1:01:05] amen that perfect place is not the
[1:01:07] millennium that's the place
[1:01:08] that god brings back and and that place
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:12] god makes that all the wrongs and
[1:01:14] brother brown said all the wrongs are
[1:01:15] made right
[1:01:16] and that place of a thousand years of
[1:01:18] killing the first curse because remember
[1:01:20] the millennium is still a period of time
[1:01:23] the millennium is a thousand years it is
[1:01:25] a time element
[1:01:27] but when that new city the full
[1:01:29] restoration that kingdom sets in
[1:01:31] it's eternity there is no time element
[1:01:34] to that
[1:01:35] amen amen now uh
[1:01:38] in the mysteries of uh of christ the
[1:01:40] mystery of god revealed
[1:01:42] i want to just read this to you as we
[1:01:45] enter into this third part now
[1:01:46] secondly he said as we just came through
[1:01:49] to have the preeminence
[1:01:50] in his body of believers that is his
[1:01:53] bride
[1:01:54] that he might live in his people
[1:01:57] how many can attest to that god living
[1:02:01] in his people now he could do that
[1:02:04] uh he uh now he could do that in adam
[1:02:07] and eve but sin
[1:02:08] separated them and now he had to come
[1:02:10] some other way to get back again
[1:02:13] he said oh this is so rich to me i just
[1:02:15] even think of it
[1:02:16] see what god's purpose was now that's
[1:02:19] when he could express the preeminence
[1:02:21] you see he's got the man or the person
[1:02:24] so that he knows nothing but christ
[1:02:27] that's the full preeminence to know
[1:02:30] nothing but christ
[1:02:31] what did paul say i don't know nothing
[1:02:34] among you
[1:02:35] save christ and him crucified that's
[1:02:37] that place in
[1:02:39] full control in god's full control you
[1:02:41] get what i mean all right that's
[1:02:42] secondly first
[1:02:44] express himself completely god in christ
[1:02:48] second to have the preeminence in uh by
[1:02:50] this in his church which is his body the
[1:02:52] bride
[1:02:53] he could have the preeminence to express
[1:02:55] himself through
[1:02:57] he says them i say us us as a body of
[1:03:01] believers
[1:03:01] internationally we in this church are a
[1:03:04] part of that
[1:03:06] all right and thirdly to restore the
[1:03:08] kingdom
[1:03:09] to its rightly position that fell by sin
[1:03:12] by the first adam
[1:03:14] back to where he walked in the cool of
[1:03:16] the evening with his people
[1:03:18] praise the lord amen amen that's the
[1:03:21] restoration i want to go to
[1:03:23] that's the restoration that's the utopia
[1:03:26] that my soul's striving for amen
[1:03:29] praise god talk with them fellowship
[1:03:31] with them and now sin and death
[1:03:33] separated them from his presence and his
[1:03:35] entire expression
[1:03:37] do you read it before the foundational
[1:03:39] world to express all of his attributes
[1:03:41] therefore oh my listen now if any
[1:03:45] trinitarian here
[1:03:46] now there's none here but if any
[1:03:48] trinitarian hearer there i say watch on
[1:03:50] streaming or
[1:03:51] archiving this video you're a
[1:03:53] trinitarian here
[1:03:54] if you just let yourself loose just a
[1:03:56] minute you can see that father
[1:03:58] son the holy ghost is not three gods is
[1:04:00] three
[1:04:01] attributes of the same god his
[1:04:04] expression father he wanted to be a
[1:04:07] father he was a father
[1:04:08] he was a son he is the holy ghost and
[1:04:11] the father and the holy ghost is the
[1:04:12] same spirit don't you see
[1:04:14] get it not three gods devils taught you
[1:04:17] them things to make an idolater out of
[1:04:19] you
[1:04:20] see it's one god expressing three
[1:04:23] attributes to
[1:04:24] uh to be father to be savior to be son
[1:04:26] to be healer is his
[1:04:27] expression some more in there i'll just
[1:04:30] leave that
[1:04:30] and see if the lord will bring that up
[1:04:32] later but to lead that to bring that
[1:04:34] expression
[1:04:35] see and we went through that of course
[1:04:37] we talked about the foundation
[1:04:39] that this body bride is to be built upon
[1:04:42] that foundation that was laid there
[1:04:44] jesus said upon that foundation i'll
[1:04:46] build my church
[1:04:48] i will build my bride you my friends
[1:04:50] this bride today
[1:04:51] built on that foundation of who jesus
[1:04:54] christ is
[1:04:55] the full revelation of jesus christ and
[1:04:58] manifestation not as the second person
[1:05:00] in the trinity
[1:05:01] but god almighty fully expressed in
[1:05:04] jesus christ in flesh form
[1:05:06] that's who he was that's who he is he's
[1:05:09] still not
[1:05:10] he's still the same today as he has
[1:05:12] always been
[1:05:14] now let's look what a kingdom is for a
[1:05:16] moment
[1:05:17] a kingdom is basically a kingship
[1:05:21] it's a place or a domain or a dominion
[1:05:25] or someone has royal power or location
[1:05:30] a royal power this kingdom it's a it's a
[1:05:34] as we know i probably don't need to go
[1:05:36] in it deeply but
[1:05:37] it is is again a place of dominion
[1:05:40] uh usually there's borders and there's
[1:05:44] uh lines that is a person or a physical
[1:05:49] human earthly king's domain
[1:05:52] that's what he controls let's just say
[1:05:55] he controls
[1:05:56] this property then the king of this
[1:05:58] property controls everything from this
[1:06:00] fence over here
[1:06:01] to that fence back there to this fence
[1:06:03] over here to the road right there
[1:06:06] that's the dominion now if a person's in
[1:06:08] the road he doesn't have dominion over
[1:06:10] that
[1:06:11] you understand what i'm saying if he
[1:06:13] goes beyond that wall that king
[1:06:15] has no dominion over that amen you know
[1:06:17] brother graham says you can get out from
[1:06:19] under the blood of jesus christ and god
[1:06:21] is not responsible for you
[1:06:23] if you get out from under or outside of
[1:06:26] the domain
[1:06:26] of the kingdom of god then where are you
[1:06:29] at
[1:06:30] you're in the kingdom of satan obviously
[1:06:33] but that domain or that dominion
[1:06:35] is god's place it's his royal
[1:06:38] power and property that god has
[1:06:41] amen now that's a physical kingdom and
[1:06:44] to restore that kingdom as we know
[1:06:46] is to bring back to its rightful
[1:06:48] position that's all
[1:06:50] we know what restoration is to bring
[1:06:52] back to its rightful position so to re
[1:06:55] to restore this kingdom means that there
[1:06:58] was a time
[1:06:59] there was a place where there was a a
[1:07:02] kingdom a dominion that god had complete
[1:07:06] control and full dominion over now
[1:07:09] remember brother branham said
[1:07:10] that adam was an amateur god that he was
[1:07:13] the god of the earth god's the god of
[1:07:15] the
[1:07:16] universe everywhere he was the god of
[1:07:18] adam amen
[1:07:19] god almighty he's the god of adam adam
[1:07:22] was the god over the earth if you speak
[1:07:24] namesake do whatever you wanted see
[1:07:26] so that was his dominion well everything
[1:07:29] around was god's dominion but when adam
[1:07:31] lost
[1:07:32] uh his right to life he lost his right
[1:07:35] to the book of life he lost his right to
[1:07:37] life itself thus man began to die after
[1:07:40] that
[1:07:41] they weren't intended to die man had
[1:07:43] eternal life but they
[1:07:44] lost their right to life and inheritance
[1:07:47] in life
[1:07:48] so all of that entered into and of
[1:07:50] course the dominion
[1:07:52] that adam had dominion over which was
[1:07:54] this earth adam had dominion over the
[1:07:57] earth he
[1:07:57] lost it to satan so it became satan's
[1:08:00] domain
[1:08:01] so it as his earth became satan's domain
[1:08:04] and he is still today satan's domain
[1:08:06] even though christ has bought it back
[1:08:08] with his own blood
[1:08:09] this domain still is satan's eden but
[1:08:12] yet if
[1:08:13] it rightly rightfully law rightfully
[1:08:16] belongs to god
[1:08:18] satan now is simply a squatter and god's
[1:08:21] allowed him to do that
[1:08:22] god's allowed it to be satan's eden
[1:08:24] because in god's way
[1:08:25] and in god's time god's gonna take it
[1:08:28] back right
[1:08:29] amen amen and when he does that then all
[1:08:32] then all this all this will be done
[1:08:35] uh it's it struck me the other day when
[1:08:39] uh and brother greene's voice rang in my
[1:08:41] head
[1:08:42] border to border coast to coast i think
[1:08:44] of all that going to crazy over the
[1:08:46] and understandably the fires are just
[1:08:48] devastating california oregon washington
[1:08:50] is just
[1:08:51] it's just a horrible thing to look at
[1:08:53] and watch i mean
[1:08:54] the smoke coming over this city for
[1:08:56] three or four days to block the sun it's
[1:08:58] so thick
[1:08:59] over there in northern california and
[1:09:01] oregon
[1:09:02] that's how bad it is but i think they
[1:09:05] think that's bad
[1:09:06] wait till this country is burned border
[1:09:09] to border and coast to coast
[1:09:11] forget one little area of the country
[1:09:14] we're talking about
[1:09:15] all the entire united states from
[1:09:17] atlantic to pacific from canada mexico
[1:09:21] burned over judgment
[1:09:24] it's in a place of judgment right now
[1:09:26] but why is it it's to bring back and
[1:09:28] restore the kingdom
[1:09:29] so when adam lost his inheritance he
[1:09:32] lost his inheritance in life he lost the
[1:09:34] earth that he had control over because
[1:09:36] remember
[1:09:37] he was the god of the earth the amateur
[1:09:39] god under god almighty
[1:09:40] of this earth he lost that into the
[1:09:42] hands of the one he lost it to
[1:09:44] so god has come and bring back to
[1:09:46] restore
[1:09:47] that kingdom back to its rightful
[1:09:49] position
[1:09:51] all this is god's motion god's position
[1:09:54] to bring it back to restore
[1:09:56] where it was in god's mind
[1:09:59] perfectly to restore
[1:10:03] that kingdom taking it away from satan
[1:10:06] well he's already done that
[1:10:08] remember when jesus died at calvary the
[1:10:09] chemistry of the blood fell on the earth
[1:10:11] that redeemed this earth back the power
[1:10:14] of the blood of god not the blood of a
[1:10:15] buller go to a jew or gentile
[1:10:17] but the blood of almighty god purchased
[1:10:19] this earth back into his possession
[1:10:22] again
[1:10:22] right now all that adam lost
[1:10:26] now you want to talk about a full
[1:10:27] restoration you want to talk about a
[1:10:29] full
[1:10:30] expression of a bride to this day think
[1:10:33] about all that
[1:10:34] brother adam said in the breach all that
[1:10:36] adam lost
[1:10:37] has now been given back into the hands
[1:10:39] of the bride
[1:10:41] it's her possession amen
[1:10:44] it's satan's eating friend but you still
[1:10:47] now
[1:10:47] again have the ability to speak to name
[1:10:50] to say
[1:10:51] to do what you want if you can have
[1:10:53] faith
[1:10:54] and speak to this mountain to be moved
[1:10:56] into it
[1:10:58] amen that's the scripture friend we're
[1:10:59] not outside the bible that's the bible
[1:11:01] we just got to understand
[1:11:02] and learn to take our position in what
[1:11:05] god has given to us
[1:11:06] this belongs to us it doesn't belong to
[1:11:09] savior
[1:11:10] satan wants to make you think it's still
[1:11:11] his but it's not it belongs to us yeah
[1:11:13] we're here
[1:11:14] in the middle of satan's eden but god
[1:11:17] has given us
[1:11:18] full authority the full authority as
[1:11:20] adam would have in the garden of eden
[1:11:22] god has given before the fall god has
[1:11:24] given that back to the bride today
[1:11:26] that's what you call a restoration to
[1:11:29] restore this
[1:11:29] kingdom back to its right position now
[1:11:32] we're going to
[1:11:34] talk about and go back from this
[1:11:35] restoration
[1:11:37] back and forth of this kingdom because
[1:11:40] there's an understanding we have to get
[1:11:42] to
[1:11:44] the place to realize that this was a
[1:11:46] spiritual kingdom
[1:11:48] before it ever became a physical kingdom
[1:11:52] understand this was a spiritual kingdom
[1:11:55] before it ever became a physical kingdom
[1:11:58] because in god in elohim in the
[1:12:01] self-existing one in his mind in his
[1:12:03] thoughts attributes
[1:12:05] before god ever spoke to create the
[1:12:07] world's galaxies whatever is out there
[1:12:10] before he ever spoke it was already in
[1:12:13] him
[1:12:14] it was his spiritual kingdom brother
[1:12:16] aaron said he had
[1:12:17] attributes his attributes we just read a
[1:12:20] little bit of to be a father
[1:12:22] to be a son to be a healer to be a
[1:12:26] savior
[1:12:27] to all these attributes that god is
[1:12:29] today those are a lot of the ones we
[1:12:31] most commonly refer to all those
[1:12:34] attributes god was wasn't desired to
[1:12:36] express he could not do in that place
[1:12:38] when he was just the self-existing by
[1:12:40] himself he could not do it
[1:12:42] he couldn't express himself as a father
[1:12:44] till he had someone
[1:12:46] to be a father to he couldn't express
[1:12:48] himself his son he couldn't express
[1:12:49] himself
[1:12:50] as healer until someone was sick god
[1:12:52] could never be a healer
[1:12:54] amen until someone was lost god could
[1:12:57] never be
[1:12:58] a savior right so all this was in god
[1:13:01] all this kingdom of god was spiritual
[1:13:04] before it became physical
[1:13:06] and we're talking about the restoration
[1:13:07] of that physical kingdom we've got to
[1:13:09] understand
[1:13:10] the restoration of that spiritual
[1:13:12] kingdom or the bringing into that
[1:13:13] spiritual kingdom
[1:13:14] is first and foremost before the
[1:13:16] physical can come about
[1:13:18] the spiritual has to be in line first
[1:13:21] before the physical can come about
[1:13:22] that's why
[1:13:23] jesus had to come shed his blood that's
[1:13:26] why there was a gentile bride to come up
[1:13:28] to restore
[1:13:29] her the second eve back to her position
[1:13:33] so when she's back in her position now
[1:13:35] that earth can come see
[1:13:36] the spiritual had to be done first in
[1:13:39] you
[1:13:40] in me it was spiritual it wasn't
[1:13:42] physical
[1:13:43] right now it becomes physical when we
[1:13:46] make it physical
[1:13:47] because we allow god to we read the
[1:13:50] bible we allow god to shape us and mold
[1:13:52] us
[1:13:52] and we don't do the things we used to do
[1:13:55] we don't wear the same clothes we don't
[1:13:56] used to do we don't
[1:13:58] go same place as we used to because
[1:14:00] we're different so
[1:14:01] it morphs itself into a physical
[1:14:03] manifestation of god in our lives
[1:14:06] but it's a spiritual restoration
[1:14:09] the physical restoration doesn't take
[1:14:11] place until the body change
[1:14:13] then the physical restoration takes
[1:14:15] place and of course when this body's
[1:14:16] changed and the world can't hold us
[1:14:18] anymore
[1:14:19] the the thai melon of this world cannot
[1:14:22] hold a timeless body
[1:14:23] that's why when god come to abraham he
[1:14:25] had he had to create a body out of the
[1:14:28] dust
[1:14:29] he created brother and said created one
[1:14:31] for himself stepped into it
[1:14:33] created one for michael created one for
[1:14:35] gabriel just as examples
[1:14:37] and said michael step into this body
[1:14:39] gabriel step into this body
[1:14:41] and the three of them went down and met
[1:14:43] abraham i remember
[1:14:45] amen but they kept doing it in the way
[1:14:47] that they were existing at the time
[1:14:48] there had to be
[1:14:49] something to allow them to exist in that
[1:14:52] time element
[1:14:53] well friends when this time body is
[1:14:55] taken off we're not we can't stay here
[1:14:57] anymore
[1:14:58] right when this body's changed into a a
[1:15:01] incorruptible timeless eternal body
[1:15:04] then we're out of here that's the full
[1:15:08] physical restoration
[1:15:09] of our bodies hallelujah of the physical
[1:15:13] amen and then the and then the
[1:15:15] continuation of course we know that we
[1:15:17] go the marriage suffer the land the
[1:15:18] tribulation sets in
[1:15:19] and all that continues to unfold and
[1:15:23] brings this place to where it's going to
[1:15:24] be a place that's going to be fit for
[1:15:26] christ and his bride to come and live
[1:15:28] rule and reign
[1:15:30] he'll be the light of the city right
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:33] no need of the son because he'll be the
[1:15:34] light of that city that's going to be
[1:15:37] that that will be that restoration
[1:15:39] well when did god start now
[1:15:43] we know the creation we read the first
[1:15:45] two chapters of genesis and we read the
[1:15:47] creation we know it was
[1:15:49] god's creation it was god's kingdom it
[1:15:51] was god's mind
[1:15:52] that he brought forth and god created it
[1:15:55] we we can read that we know that and
[1:15:57] that creation came
[1:15:58] and adam came and animals body life
[1:16:00] animal life
[1:16:01] and and and then he created eve and from
[1:16:04] adam came
[1:16:05] woman helped me eve uh so that place was
[1:16:08] god's kingdom uh it was so
[1:16:12] much god's kingdom that god came down
[1:16:15] in the cool of the evening every evening
[1:16:18] to speak to his creation that was so it
[1:16:21] was so much his
[1:16:23] he personally came every day and spoke
[1:16:26] to adam lift the ear
[1:16:28] amen amen that's the restoration i'm
[1:16:31] talking hallelujah that's the
[1:16:32] restoration i'm looking for so much his
[1:16:35] but then when adam lost it that was done
[1:16:39] god no longer come and fellowship with
[1:16:41] them they couldn't even stand in god's
[1:16:43] presence then
[1:16:44] only only the lambs the the bloody lambs
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:47] god slew allowed them to even come into
[1:16:49] his presence momentarily but a great
[1:16:51] but a great a chasm was thrown between
[1:16:54] god and man
[1:16:55] see and then and now all of a sudden
[1:16:58] this dominion that was god's this
[1:17:00] kingdom that was god's was
[1:17:02] was lost into the hands of another and
[1:17:05] adam was still here
[1:17:07] but he didn't get his daily visit from
[1:17:09] god anymore
[1:17:11] because of that great chasm that great
[1:17:13] gulf
[1:17:14] you stand on one end of the ocean and
[1:17:15] another on the other end of the ocean
[1:17:17] you say well how am i going to get to
[1:17:18] that person
[1:17:19] or you can stand on the south front of
[1:17:21] the grand canyon and a friend stand on
[1:17:22] the north end of the grand canyon how
[1:17:24] about i get to get to them
[1:17:25] uh people can hike it go down and back
[1:17:28] and forth or take a boat across the
[1:17:29] colorado or whatever however they do it
[1:17:31] but there's that great gulf how do i get
[1:17:34] there
[1:17:36] well jesus christ had to come and bridge
[1:17:39] that gap
[1:17:40] by his own blood bridge that gap now
[1:17:42] that we can come back to fellowship with
[1:17:44] god
[1:17:45] now as god came in his physical kingdom
[1:17:48] to have fellowship lift to ear with his
[1:17:51] creation with his son
[1:17:52] with adam the first created son of god
[1:17:55] only created son of god
[1:17:57] when he had that now it's a spiritual
[1:18:00] communion it's a spiritual fellowship
[1:18:03] now we can have
[1:18:04] fellowship with god every day it's not
[1:18:07] that he comes in a
[1:18:09] in a corporal body and we sit down and
[1:18:12] talk or have a meal together
[1:18:14] but every day we have the opportunity to
[1:18:17] speak to him i was going to say bow our
[1:18:19] heads but you don't even have to do that
[1:18:21] a lot of times i do because the bowing
[1:18:23] of the head shows reverence but it also
[1:18:25] shows
[1:18:26] it also shuts out the world right when
[1:18:29] you talk to god you bow your head or
[1:18:31] close your eyes you're shutting out the
[1:18:32] world
[1:18:33] and you put earplugs in you want but
[1:18:36] usually
[1:18:37] we don't but you bow your head that's
[1:18:39] reverence and you're shutting out the
[1:18:41] world
[1:18:41] amen you're not seeing everything else
[1:18:43] going on so it's a
[1:18:44] it's a way that we talk to the lord but
[1:18:46] you can talk to him any way you want
[1:18:48] you can stand and look up you can you
[1:18:51] can just talk to him
[1:18:52] right have fellowship with him it's not
[1:18:55] the same lift to ear
[1:18:56] but it's life to life spirit to spirit
[1:18:59] right yeah we have
[1:19:00] fellowship and communion with the lord
[1:19:02] that's that's our ability that
[1:19:03] that restoration has taken place that
[1:19:06] spiritual
[1:19:07] kingdom restoration has taken place but
[1:19:10] as god created this place we read it
[1:19:12] first and we could read it first two
[1:19:14] chapters of genesis
[1:19:16] and god created and god created and god
[1:19:18] created him made it exactly the way he
[1:19:20] wanted to be
[1:19:22] he created his man he created the man to
[1:19:24] help me
[1:19:25] and then the fall took place but i want
[1:19:28] to go over to genesis
[1:19:31] and read here in in genesis 3.
[1:19:38] we've hit this uh
[1:19:41] what time or two during this series
[1:19:43] already
[1:19:45] uh it was it was during the
[1:19:48] the time where we were talking about god
[1:19:52] manifesting himself or revealing himself
[1:19:54] to his people making himself known to
[1:19:56] his people remember the first part of
[1:19:58] this
[1:19:58] series we did we did god revealing
[1:20:01] himself for manifesting himself to his
[1:20:03] people
[1:20:04] making himself real to his people that
[1:20:06] was the first part of this that we did
[1:20:08] before
[1:20:09] having the preeminence well this here
[1:20:11] was a part of that
[1:20:13] but it also as i was studying about it
[1:20:17] yesterday and seeing where the lord
[1:20:18] wanted me to go with this
[1:20:20] that this is the part that we come back
[1:20:22] to you've got the kingdom being
[1:20:25] made and in the beginning of the third
[1:20:28] verse or the third chapter
[1:20:29] you have the kingdom falling and the
[1:20:33] kingdom
[1:20:33] falling into the hands of another which
[1:20:35] we've already talked about
[1:20:37] that kingdom fell into and it's still in
[1:20:40] the hands
[1:20:41] the grubby nasty filthy hands of the
[1:20:43] devil
[1:20:44] and it's still in his hands doesn't
[1:20:46] belong to him anymore but again
[1:20:48] it's still in his hands still satan's
[1:20:50] even so the beginning of the third
[1:20:52] chapter is the fall of that kingdom
[1:20:55] it is a follow that kingdom into sin and
[1:20:57] the kingdom going into the hands of
[1:20:59] another
[1:21:00] but i want you to notice something just
[1:21:03] after that
[1:21:03] fall as you can read the first few
[1:21:05] verses we'll begin our reading
[1:21:08] in the 11th verse and he said who told
[1:21:12] god said to adam
[1:21:14] who told thee that thou was naked hast
[1:21:17] thou
[1:21:17] eaten of the tree where i commanded thee
[1:21:20] that thou
[1:21:21] shouldst not eat now remember that
[1:21:24] command
[1:21:26] and that bringing back from god to adam
[1:21:29] was only to adam he never
[1:21:32] said this to eve he never says this to
[1:21:35] the serpent
[1:21:36] he only said this to adam
[1:21:39] because adam was the god of the earth
[1:21:41] not the serpent
[1:21:43] not eve the woman she wasn't even she
[1:21:46] wasn't
[1:21:47] adam was god put adam in charge
[1:21:51] god put adam in control and adam
[1:21:54] failed so god comes to him and says have
[1:21:58] you done
[1:21:59] what i told you not to do
[1:22:02] i didn't tell her i didn't tell him
[1:22:06] i told you don't do this and you did it
[1:22:10] now of course is is a
[1:22:13] customary among human beings especially
[1:22:16] it seems like americans
[1:22:18] we begin to pass the book and the man
[1:22:21] said the woman whom
[1:22:23] thou gave us to me to be with me
[1:22:26] she gave of the tree and i did eat oh
[1:22:29] does that make it her fault
[1:22:32] do your actions now become her
[1:22:34] responsibility
[1:22:37] not with god they're not there might be
[1:22:39] in this world in this warped way of
[1:22:41] thinking that people think today
[1:22:43] oh it's their fault because i did
[1:22:45] something no
[1:22:46] no no no no you did it it's your fault
[1:22:50] you said it it's your fault you're
[1:22:52] responsible for your own actions i don't
[1:22:54] care what happened over here
[1:22:56] i don't care who may have influenced you
[1:22:57] or whatever that
[1:22:59] you are responsible for your own actions
[1:23:02] but of course
[1:23:03] you know as it is today it's always
[1:23:06] everybody else's fault
[1:23:08] it's always somebody else's fault
[1:23:11] that's true so he says the woman thou
[1:23:15] gave me and the lord said unto the woman
[1:23:18] what is this that thou has done
[1:23:20] and the woman said the serpent begot me
[1:23:22] and i did eat
[1:23:24] is the serpent responsible for her
[1:23:26] actions
[1:23:27] nope she is and god
[1:23:31] holds them responsible another thing
[1:23:33] that
[1:23:34] just doesn't seem to be going over very
[1:23:36] good today
[1:23:37] holding people responsible for their own
[1:23:39] actions
[1:23:40] where did that ever go to yeah when i
[1:23:42] was young
[1:23:43] i was very responsible for my actions
[1:23:46] and all the things i saw and noticed
[1:23:48] around the world mostly at least around
[1:23:49] the country
[1:23:50] people were responsible for their own
[1:23:52] actions where is that gone
[1:23:54] i'm not really sure but again the woman
[1:23:58] the the serpent is not responsible for
[1:24:01] her actions
[1:24:02] she did what she did is her action
[1:24:05] but she's going to blame somebody else
[1:24:08] don't blame anybody else friend if you
[1:24:10] made a mistake you want them to
[1:24:12] make a mistake if you've done something
[1:24:14] or said something wrong
[1:24:15] on up to your mistake repent for it make
[1:24:18] it right
[1:24:18] right people will have more respect for
[1:24:21] you if you do that
[1:24:22] god will certainly handle respect for
[1:24:24] you if you do that
[1:24:25] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[1:24:27] because thou has done this thou
[1:24:30] art cursed above all cattle and above
[1:24:32] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[1:24:34] shalt thou
[1:24:35] go and thus shalt be thy uh shalt thou
[1:24:38] eat all the days of thy life now notice
[1:24:41] god didn't give the serpent a space
[1:24:45] here he gave the woman he gave the man
[1:24:48] a space to explain to to
[1:24:52] give their side of the story he didn't
[1:24:54] give that to the serpent because
[1:24:55] remember
[1:24:56] the serpent doesn't have a soul because
[1:24:58] the serpent was an animal
[1:25:00] the serpent wasn't a human being animal
[1:25:02] doesn't have a soul
[1:25:04] so if he doesn't have a soul and you say
[1:25:06] well
[1:25:08] the actions he performed are just the
[1:25:10] actions he performed whether it's the
[1:25:11] under the influence of somebody else or
[1:25:13] not
[1:25:14] the responsibility that falls into a
[1:25:16] human by their
[1:25:17] soul which is their free will didn't
[1:25:19] exist with the serpent
[1:25:21] it only existed with the man and the
[1:25:23] woman because they had the soul they had
[1:25:25] free will they had
[1:25:26] choice and and
[1:25:29] which is determined in your soul see
[1:25:33] so cursed he said and of course he
[1:25:35] cursed thee
[1:25:36] uh cursed him on his belly and i will
[1:25:38] put enmity between thee and the woman
[1:25:40] and between thy seed and her seed it
[1:25:43] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:25:44] bruise his heel now
[1:25:45] how many verses is that and you could
[1:25:48] have broke it up into one verse
[1:25:50] or you could have made it kept it one
[1:25:52] verse you could have broke it up to two
[1:25:53] verses
[1:25:54] three verses but according to my bible
[1:25:57] and probably most bibles i guess how
[1:26:00] many verses is this
[1:26:01] after the fall uh
[1:26:05] it began in the sixth verse the woman
[1:26:08] saw that the tree was good for food so
[1:26:09] the fall began the sixth verse
[1:26:12] the sixth first to the fifteenth verse
[1:26:14] that's nine verses
[1:26:17] i want you to grasp this nine verses
[1:26:21] in in the infancy of god god the
[1:26:24] almighty omnipotent
[1:26:25] eternal god nine verses how they broke
[1:26:29] it up
[1:26:30] after the fall god has already
[1:26:33] spoken in this ink in this world
[1:26:37] the rest the beginning of that
[1:26:39] restoration
[1:26:41] you see it god is already
[1:26:44] nine verses after the fall beginning the
[1:26:47] restoration of that kingdom
[1:26:49] how is he doing it he says because i
[1:26:52] will put enmity between
[1:26:54] your seed and the woman's seed
[1:26:57] remember friend in our teaching earlier
[1:27:00] the woman does not have a seed
[1:27:03] she has a an egg a field
[1:27:06] is the male with the hemoglobin that has
[1:27:08] the seed
[1:27:09] that has the life the woman doesn't have
[1:27:12] a seed
[1:27:13] so how did god reference to
[1:27:16] to to the serpent that that
[1:27:19] that the enmity the division the hatred
[1:27:23] would be between the serpent seed and
[1:27:26] the woman
[1:27:26] see when the woman has no seed the
[1:27:30] serpent had a seat
[1:27:31] people want to deny serpenty but it's
[1:27:33] right here in the bible
[1:27:34] right the serpent had a seed but the
[1:27:37] woman did not have seed
[1:27:39] so what's the seed that god's
[1:27:41] referencing here
[1:27:42] that's going to be the great hatred and
[1:27:44] enmity between the serpent seed
[1:27:47] and her seed she didn't have a seed
[1:27:50] but god appointed the woman a seed when
[1:27:54] god placed in the womb of
[1:27:55] mary the very germ life of almighty god
[1:28:00] and she received seed of almighty god
[1:28:04] to produce jesus christ
[1:28:07] god already speaking about jesus
[1:28:11] god already talking about the restoring
[1:28:14] back
[1:28:15] of that kingdom it only felt
[1:28:18] 10 minutes ago 20 minutes ago the
[1:28:21] kingdom
[1:28:22] just fell the physical part
[1:28:25] of god's spoken word kingdom had just
[1:28:28] fallen
[1:28:29] and god is already speaking the
[1:28:32] restoration of that kingdom hallelujah
[1:28:34] by talking about the seed of the woman
[1:28:36] which is jesus christ
[1:28:37] amen amen it already began
[1:28:41] began 20 minutes after it failed god's
[1:28:43] already starting it back
[1:28:45] praise the lord don't see god's people
[1:28:48] say well
[1:28:49] things have happened haphazardly or
[1:28:52] that was a coincidence or that was luck
[1:28:55] friend
[1:28:56] there is no such thing not in the world
[1:28:58] of a christian there is no such thing as
[1:29:00] luck
[1:29:01] there is no such thing as coincidence
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:04] god has everything controlled god is
[1:29:07] orchestrating this whole thing
[1:29:08] and everything that god does is for
[1:29:11] reason and purpose
[1:29:12] yes we may not understand it but
[1:29:14] everything is according to god's purpose
[1:29:16] reason and he knows what he's doing
[1:29:20] better than we do right i mean i can't
[1:29:23] stand up here friend and tell you
[1:29:25] but you know i love you but i couldn't
[1:29:27] stand up here and tell you that
[1:29:28] that that i've never said or questioned
[1:29:31] god's
[1:29:32] wisdom uh god why would you do this
[1:29:35] i can't say i've never done that right
[1:29:38] i've probably done it way more than i
[1:29:40] should have
[1:29:41] questioned god's providence question
[1:29:44] god's
[1:29:44] uh uh will and and perfect uh design
[1:29:48] that he had god why did you do this
[1:29:50] or even think in my mind that i had a
[1:29:52] better way of doing it
[1:29:54] oh now i know you have enough no you
[1:29:56] haven't thought oh god i had a better
[1:29:58] way of doing that you might not have
[1:29:59] verbalized it
[1:30:00] but you probably thought if i was going
[1:30:01] to do it this way god i'd have done this
[1:30:03] right yeah god said if god could open up
[1:30:06] the eternity so he just said yeah this
[1:30:07] is where you'd ended up too
[1:30:09] yeah this whole god thank you thank you
[1:30:12] for the little
[1:30:12] thank you for the little prick in my
[1:30:14] flesh over here so i didn't lose my soul
[1:30:16] over here
[1:30:17] amen praise the lord but notice god
[1:30:20] began
[1:30:20] right there that was the beginning of
[1:30:22] god's kingdom right there
[1:30:24] god had already started it god had
[1:30:26] already began by speaking
[1:30:28] jesus christ now we know that woman seed
[1:30:31] of course through the message of the
[1:30:33] hour
[1:30:33] and through the the revelation of the
[1:30:35] word that woman see became jesus christ
[1:30:39] god appointed a seed the
[1:30:42] germ of almighty god coming into the
[1:30:44] womb of a woman
[1:30:46] hey man how wonderful friend
[1:30:49] god's speaking that bringing jesus and
[1:30:51] the course that be in
[1:30:53] enmity and we've talked about thou shalt
[1:30:55] bruise his head now
[1:30:56] he shall bruise thy heal as we've talked
[1:30:58] about those things but let's move on
[1:31:00] as we see 20 minutes after the fall
[1:31:05] nine verses after the fall now we know
[1:31:07] there's a few things that happened in
[1:31:09] that time
[1:31:09] whatever time period it was nine verses
[1:31:12] after the fault god's already speaking
[1:31:14] restoration praise the lord
[1:31:16] amen unto the woman he said i will
[1:31:20] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:31:22] conception
[1:31:23] and sorrow thou shalt bring four
[1:31:25] children thy desire
[1:31:26] uh shall be to thy husband and he shall
[1:31:28] rule over thee now of course we know
[1:31:31] that curse is the original sin what the
[1:31:32] original sin was
[1:31:34] well the original sin became the curse
[1:31:36] to the woman
[1:31:37] but in that curse come to one of the
[1:31:39] greatest blessings in my opinion
[1:31:41] that a woman can have to be entrusted by
[1:31:45] god
[1:31:46] as the instrument by which he will bring
[1:31:48] forth
[1:31:49] additional life right amen
[1:31:52] i've often told you and i've been
[1:31:54] challenged by this by
[1:31:57] certain other people i i won't say but
[1:32:02] that just didn't believe this and and
[1:32:05] pardon me but i've never found the quote
[1:32:07] where brother branham said it exactly
[1:32:08] like this
[1:32:09] but as i found it or saw it as god
[1:32:13] as brother branham preached it brother
[1:32:15] branham said
[1:32:16] that adam had the book of life well if
[1:32:19] adam had the book of life what was in
[1:32:21] that book
[1:32:23] life right all the life that was to come
[1:32:26] forth out of the mind of god
[1:32:28] written on the lamb's book of life
[1:32:30] before the foundation of the world we
[1:32:31] went over that
[1:32:32] before the foundation of the world that
[1:32:34] book was in adam's hand well that those
[1:32:36] names were on that book which would have
[1:32:37] been my name your name those that were
[1:32:39] gods from the beginning of time till
[1:32:41] today were to come forth how were they
[1:32:43] to come forth
[1:32:44] would god have broken his
[1:32:48] uh his way of doing things
[1:32:52] when he began further creation
[1:32:55] outside of adam and eve
[1:32:58] what he had said oh i did adam this way
[1:33:00] but you know
[1:33:01] i think it i think it'd be better if i
[1:33:03] did it this way now
[1:33:05] that's not god so if god did it one way
[1:33:08] one time we know what
[1:33:12] he's going to do it the same way every
[1:33:14] other time right
[1:33:16] that's the perfection of god there's no
[1:33:19] improvement upon that
[1:33:20] right so when god when there is life
[1:33:23] that was to come forth that was to issue
[1:33:25] forth in his
[1:33:26] in his time decreed season when that was
[1:33:30] to come forth how was it to come forth
[1:33:34] adam had the book of life brother brown
[1:33:37] tells us plainly had the book of life
[1:33:38] and
[1:33:39] uh the earth and all the inheritance of
[1:33:42] life that was his
[1:33:44] see so if he had it and god was going to
[1:33:47] create
[1:33:48] a different way at a different time
[1:33:50] god's not going to do that so how's god
[1:33:51] going to create
[1:33:52] the next person that comes along
[1:33:56] by the same way he created adam in the
[1:33:58] beginning right
[1:33:59] by speaking the word well if god
[1:34:03] entrusted adam enough to have the book
[1:34:06] don't you think he would have entrusted
[1:34:07] adam enough to read that name or to call
[1:34:10] that name or to bring that
[1:34:11] that name out of the dust of the earth
[1:34:13] right
[1:34:14] now again i i've been challenged on that
[1:34:17] and i can't produce you in the exact
[1:34:19] quote that brother brown said that
[1:34:20] but with everything i read and see it
[1:34:23] just it just makes perfect sense to me
[1:34:26] god used the voice of adam to speak
[1:34:29] those things
[1:34:30] to come forth i believe that's how life
[1:34:33] was to
[1:34:33] to be issued before the fall was to be
[1:34:36] spoken word
[1:34:37] because that's what he did the first
[1:34:39] time if he did it that way the first
[1:34:41] time he's going to do it that way every
[1:34:43] other time
[1:34:44] it was going to be spoken so
[1:34:47] that entrustment now of adam
[1:34:51] of god to adam of the bringing or
[1:34:53] issuing forth of
[1:34:55] life notice something
[1:34:59] even though god says i will greatly
[1:35:02] multiply that i saw
[1:35:03] my conception she's now
[1:35:06] conceiving before the fall she wasn't
[1:35:10] conceiving
[1:35:12] this is only after the fault this is
[1:35:14] god's permission
[1:35:15] conception is god's permissive will
[1:35:19] not his perfect will but
[1:35:22] god took from adam because he lost the
[1:35:26] book now he didn't lose the book to say
[1:35:28] he lost the book of life into the hands
[1:35:29] of the original honor god
[1:35:31] god had the book of life then not satan
[1:35:35] brother graham said god's filthy satan's
[1:35:37] filthy hands couldn't take that
[1:35:39] that went back to the hands of god so
[1:35:40] god had it but god transferred now
[1:35:44] from the spoken word perfect will to the
[1:35:47] issuing of conception permissive will
[1:35:50] god
[1:35:51] transferred that from adam in my opinion
[1:35:55] speaking that name from the book of life
[1:35:57] to bring it forth from the dust of the
[1:35:59] earth
[1:35:59] to the woman now the woman's entrusted
[1:36:03] with bringing forth life into the world
[1:36:06] now to me that is a tremendous trust
[1:36:10] that god has entrusted to the woman and
[1:36:12] it i i
[1:36:13] i see it as a blessing although a lot of
[1:36:16] people today who tote their dogs and
[1:36:18] cats around would probably disagree with
[1:36:20] me
[1:36:21] uh but i i disagree with them
[1:36:24] i mean crying out loud folks you hear
[1:36:26] you hear more about adopting a dog today
[1:36:28] than you do adopting a human
[1:36:30] yeah i'm sorry soapboxagon
[1:36:33] but that just just a sign of the times
[1:36:36] to me
[1:36:37] i mean where they seem more concerned
[1:36:39] with adopting an animal than they are
[1:36:40] adopting a human
[1:36:41] they'd rather just kill the human and be
[1:36:43] dumb and just you know
[1:36:45] be done with that so my how everything
[1:36:48] slips but notice here
[1:36:50] that i i brought this out just i mean uh
[1:36:53] to me i i brought it out once before i
[1:36:55] think in the justification series but
[1:36:57] this
[1:36:57] uh this is just uh to me uh
[1:37:02] there's been there's been a lot over the
[1:37:04] years of
[1:37:06] the in my opinion of the beating down of
[1:37:10] women
[1:37:10] and that's a horrible thing you precious
[1:37:14] sisters are absolute
[1:37:15] jewels in the crown of a man or in god's
[1:37:18] mind jewels
[1:37:20] that's right so much so god entrusted
[1:37:23] you
[1:37:23] your body to him
[1:37:26] to issue forth life that's just
[1:37:29] wonderful but let's move
[1:37:31] move on sorry thou shall break for that
[1:37:34] children thy desire to be
[1:37:35] thy husband and thou and he shall rule
[1:37:37] over him over thee but remember
[1:37:39] again no mention of anything that god
[1:37:43] said i told you not to do this
[1:37:45] there's not a mention of that god did
[1:37:46] not say that
[1:37:48] he didn't say it to the serpent he
[1:37:50] didn't say it to the woman
[1:37:51] he didn't say did you do what i told you
[1:37:53] not to do he didn't tell that to the
[1:37:54] woman
[1:37:56] amen he told it to the man
[1:37:59] where does responsibility fall today
[1:38:02] or did it fall then or does it fall
[1:38:05] today
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:10] so many times this message wants to beat
[1:38:12] down women friend
[1:38:14] i'm sorry but the man is the one
[1:38:15] responsible before god
[1:38:17] all right absolutely it was here and it
[1:38:20] is now
[1:38:22] and unto adam he said because thou has
[1:38:24] hearkened to the voice of thy wife and
[1:38:26] has eaten of the tree of which i
[1:38:28] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[1:38:30] of it
[1:38:31] again he didn't say that the woman
[1:38:33] curses the ground for thy sake
[1:38:35] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:38:37] days of thy life thorns also and
[1:38:39] thistles
[1:38:40] shall it bring forth to thee and thou
[1:38:42] shalt eat the herb of the field the
[1:38:43] sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
[1:38:45] till
[1:38:46] all till thou return unto the ground for
[1:38:48] out of it was thou
[1:38:49] taken for dust thou art until dust thou
[1:38:51] shall return because i told you
[1:38:53] that the day you eat is the day you're
[1:38:54] gonna die amen
[1:38:58] so now you came from the dust where i
[1:38:59] took you from that's where you're going
[1:39:01] back to your body is anyway
[1:39:03] adam called his wife's name even we've
[1:39:05] talked about that you know he's just now
[1:39:07] calling her eve
[1:39:08] didn't call her eve until now why
[1:39:10] because she's pregnant pregnant
[1:39:12] with twins one from the serpent one from
[1:39:15] adam
[1:39:16] calls his wife's name eve because she's
[1:39:18] the mother of all living
[1:39:20] 21st verse i want to get to this unto
[1:39:23] adam also into his wife did the lord god
[1:39:26] make coats of skins and clothe them
[1:39:28] now the second now you got you got
[1:39:31] the fall you've got the curses
[1:39:35] and in there you have god mentioning
[1:39:37] jesus christ not by name but by the
[1:39:40] woman see
[1:39:41] mentioning jesus the beginning of that
[1:39:43] restoration of the kingdom
[1:39:45] then you have more curses coming along
[1:39:47] to to adam and the ground
[1:39:49] well adam wasn't cursed but the earth
[1:39:51] was cursed for his sake
[1:39:53] um thanks adam it's pretty hard out
[1:39:55] there huh
[1:39:56] hot to it bro john
[1:39:59] anyway uh but now the 21st verse
[1:40:03] we have the second in my opinion the
[1:40:05] second reference that god makes
[1:40:08] when god takes two lambs and kills them
[1:40:11] and throws
[1:40:12] the the coats of skin out to adam and
[1:40:13] eve to wear
[1:40:15] that was the second reference that that
[1:40:17] god
[1:40:18] is going to and is restoring back what
[1:40:21] had just fallen
[1:40:23] well i had just fallen into the hands of
[1:40:25] satan i'm already making plans
[1:40:27] i'm already putting in motion what it's
[1:40:30] going to take to restore this back to
[1:40:32] its rightful position
[1:40:34] he talked about the woman's seat and now
[1:40:36] he's talking about the blood
[1:40:38] he talked about jesus christ with the
[1:40:40] curse of the woman seed
[1:40:41] and now he's talking about the blood
[1:40:43] that was to be shed by the lamb
[1:40:45] the lamb's blood that was going to be a
[1:40:47] an atonement
[1:40:48] so that humanity could come back in
[1:40:50] fellowship with god again
[1:40:52] amen that allowed adam and eve it wasn't
[1:40:55] the perfect lamb
[1:40:56] but it was a lamb enough that they were
[1:40:58] able to come out of the bushes from
[1:41:00] uh well hiding not hiding but separating
[1:41:03] themselves
[1:41:04] they could they could it was adam had
[1:41:07] created a buffer by the bush
[1:41:10] god created a buffer by the blood it
[1:41:12] wasn't body like they created
[1:41:14] that was a sufficient buffer it's a it's
[1:41:17] uh the animal it's the bloodline
[1:41:19] that that's sufficient to buffer that's
[1:41:22] where adam
[1:41:22] that's where cain and abel uh uh cain
[1:41:26] abel had a greater revelation than cain
[1:41:28] kane thought that
[1:41:29] botany life buffer was going to be
[1:41:31] enough to please god
[1:41:33] and it wasn't it had to take a blood
[1:41:35] buffer
[1:41:36] to please god adam first put on fig
[1:41:39] leaves
[1:41:40] thought that was a buffer didn't buffer
[1:41:42] enough hid behind bushes
[1:41:44] so he put body life on him he hid behind
[1:41:46] botany life
[1:41:47] but that none of that was good enough it
[1:41:50] had to take the blood
[1:41:51] so god is the one that had to make the
[1:41:53] sacrifice
[1:41:54] he took the two innocent lambs and gave
[1:41:56] them so the blood could be the buffer
[1:41:59] so you see the the reference that god is
[1:42:02] already making
[1:42:03] adam losing everything bringing it back
[1:42:06] restoring it back god's already taught
[1:42:08] jesus christ and the blood
[1:42:10] just in the third verse alone just
[1:42:14] nine verses after the fall and then
[1:42:16] however many
[1:42:17] down to the 21st verse god has already
[1:42:19] made two references
[1:42:21] of the restoration a restoring back of
[1:42:24] this kingdom
[1:42:26] praise the lord amen now bringing that
[1:42:29] back to where it's supposed to be let's
[1:42:32] go back to
[1:42:33] matthew again for just a moment and i'm
[1:42:35] going to read this over my time's gotten
[1:42:37] away from me but i want to read this
[1:42:38] over again
[1:42:39] so lord willing maybe we can pick this
[1:42:41] up next week where we left off
[1:42:47] matthew chapter 6 again where we were
[1:42:50] earlier with the lord's prayer
[1:42:52] and we want to i'm going to finish this
[1:42:54] here
[1:42:56] but i'm going to preface my reading
[1:42:57] again now before i read this
[1:42:59] with the understanding that we need to
[1:43:01] remember
[1:43:02] this kingdom is not just physical it's
[1:43:05] also spiritual
[1:43:07] and it was spiritual before
[1:43:10] it became physical this kingdom
[1:43:13] the kingdom of god was spiritual before
[1:43:15] it became physical
[1:43:18] the process of this began in the garden
[1:43:21] of eden
[1:43:23] winding up with this bride of the last
[1:43:25] day which we
[1:43:26] believe we are a part of anyway the
[1:43:29] bride of the last days
[1:43:31] brought in by this
[1:43:35] the cross by the cross
[1:43:38] it was the cross that was referenced
[1:43:40] with uh uh
[1:43:41] with jacob um with
[1:43:45] israel when he crossed his hands and
[1:43:47] gave the
[1:43:48] the greater blessing to the lesser child
[1:43:51] the greater blessing that's left from
[1:43:53] the jews the
[1:43:54] the the tame olive tree over to the
[1:43:57] gentile the wild olive tree
[1:43:59] it came through the cross this cross
[1:44:02] it began there and that is the junction
[1:44:05] point
[1:44:07] that that brings us to this restoration
[1:44:09] and in that junction point
[1:44:11] of this cross jesus christ the blood
[1:44:14] being here
[1:44:15] he gives us this prayer
[1:44:18] in this prayer it says after this man i
[1:44:21] pray ye our father which and i'm not
[1:44:22] going to go through all the lord's
[1:44:24] prayer we've done this
[1:44:25] before and broke it down
[1:44:29] but i want to get to a specific after
[1:44:30] this manner therefore pray ye our father
[1:44:32] which are in heaven
[1:44:34] holy is your name thy kingdom come
[1:44:38] amen there we go thy kingdom come
[1:44:42] thy will be done in earth
[1:44:46] as it is in heaven well that's speaking
[1:44:50] of
[1:44:51] two separate if we if you will domains
[1:44:55] it's speaking of the kingdom we could
[1:44:57] say the kingdom of god
[1:44:59] and it's speaking of heaven actually
[1:45:01] speaking of three because it's talking
[1:45:03] about the earth too
[1:45:05] but i'm i'm focusing on the kingdom of
[1:45:07] god
[1:45:08] the kingdom of god in reference is
[1:45:09] there's those three domains
[1:45:11] he talks about thy kingdom come
[1:45:15] well where was it or was it that it had
[1:45:18] to come
[1:45:19] and where is it coming too it's not
[1:45:22] coming upon this earth as being
[1:45:25] transformed from satan's eden to god's
[1:45:28] domain at least not yet
[1:45:30] so where is he talking about is that thy
[1:45:32] kingdom come where is that
[1:45:34] kingdom coming to and where was it
[1:45:38] amen where was it
[1:45:42] well if this kingdom kingdom of god
[1:45:46] was spiritual then where does that
[1:45:49] kingdom come to
[1:45:52] it comes to thy will be done
[1:45:55] in earth in earth
[1:45:59] aren't you a part of the earth we're all
[1:46:01] from the dust of the earth right
[1:46:03] right we're all elements of the earth so
[1:46:05] if we came from the earth we are the
[1:46:07] earth that the kingdom has come
[1:46:09] to then who are we today
[1:46:12] or the restoration the expression of
[1:46:14] jesus christ
[1:46:15] because the kingdom has come unto you
[1:46:19] amen amen the kingdom is now
[1:46:23] in you the kingdom come now
[1:46:26] what's now now what happens now after
[1:46:28] the kingdom has come
[1:46:29] if the kingdom has come unto you because
[1:46:32] jesus told them
[1:46:34] said if you believe who i am then the
[1:46:36] kingdom has come unto
[1:46:37] you right because the kingdom was
[1:46:39] standing right there
[1:46:41] they rubbed elbows with him they ate
[1:46:43] with him they talked with him and prayed
[1:46:45] with him and
[1:46:45] uh gave him a hug around the neck
[1:46:49] washed his feet whatever they spent time
[1:46:51] they they had the kingdom in present
[1:46:54] corporal body form but in that form he
[1:46:58] could only be with one or two at a time
[1:47:00] half a dozen twenty whatever it might be
[1:47:03] but when he went away then that kingdom
[1:47:07] had to come back
[1:47:09] had to come because see jesus said
[1:47:12] thy kingdom come so where was the
[1:47:14] kingdom well the kingdom was standing
[1:47:16] right there
[1:47:18] but this model prayer is what well the
[1:47:20] kingdom's here why do we need it to come
[1:47:21] because he had to go away
[1:47:24] jesus was going away so that he could
[1:47:26] come back not just with a half a dozen
[1:47:28] with him
[1:47:30] 10 or 12 but that he can in the initial
[1:47:33] one
[1:47:34] 120 of them in one room
[1:47:37] and he split himself up like tongues of
[1:47:40] fire on each one of them
[1:47:42] and that kingdom lit upon each one of
[1:47:44] them and went
[1:47:45] into each one of them for the purpose of
[1:47:48] what
[1:47:50] so that thy will god
[1:47:54] your will would be done in me
[1:47:58] as you have already seen it foreign on
[1:48:00] it predestined
[1:48:02] in your mind before the foundation of
[1:48:04] the world
[1:48:06] let that will be done in me your kingdom
[1:48:09] has come now
[1:48:10] let that will yours whatever it is god i
[1:48:13] die to myself remember we go back to
[1:48:15] this
[1:48:15] god having full preeminence now i am
[1:48:18] dead and hid in christ
[1:48:20] i am bought with a price i'm no longer
[1:48:22] my own
[1:48:24] you get those scriptures that full
[1:48:26] preeminence that full expression
[1:48:29] thy kingdom come your will
[1:48:32] be done in earth in me
[1:48:37] as you've already saw it as you've
[1:48:39] already predestined
[1:48:40] in your mind in you in heaven let it be
[1:48:43] done
[1:48:44] in me because the kingdom has come
[1:48:47] could be done before that see that
[1:48:51] spiritual kingdom it couldn't have been
[1:48:52] done before that
[1:48:54] but that spiritual kingdom had to bring
[1:48:57] back the restoration
[1:48:58] first through jesus christ male
[1:49:02] the bride second the second adam the
[1:49:04] bride the second e
[1:49:05] female to bring back the restoration of
[1:49:08] the kingdom
[1:49:10] now we're going to that completely
[1:49:13] restored evil one day
[1:49:17] that completely restored eden but in us
[1:49:22] that spiritual kingdom god has restored
[1:49:24] to us
[1:49:26] thy kingdom come now that kingdom lives
[1:49:28] in us
[1:49:29] now god's will can be done in us
[1:49:33] as it's already done in him to bring
[1:49:35] that full expression
[1:49:37] to bring that full restoration so in us
[1:49:41] in you let this be personal in you
[1:49:44] in me that full expression today
[1:49:48] of god in you working his will
[1:49:51] wherever you go whatever you do in all
[1:49:54] of your life
[1:49:55] because that kingdom has come god's will
[1:49:58] be done in my life
[1:49:59] in your life amen let it be so
[1:50:03] whatever god's desire is not my desire
[1:50:06] his desire
[1:50:07] because our desires become his desires
[1:50:09] amen
[1:50:10] our wants become his wants or his wants
[1:50:12] become ours his desires become ours
[1:50:15] amen we're led of his spirit praise the
[1:50:18] lord
[1:50:19] amen god bless you today amen
[1:50:22] we can stand if you'd like
[1:50:36] amen
[1:50:39] it's just finished it's really to me
[1:50:44] tremendous to think about what god has
[1:50:47] done to bring this to the place it's at
[1:50:50] for god to restore this back to the
[1:50:52] place
[1:50:54] spiritually in us through us now
[1:51:00] all of us i trust all of us are
[1:51:05] us to see our loved ones those if you've
[1:51:07] had any that's gone on before
[1:51:09] to see our loved ones come before us
[1:51:14] again my brother here brother green
[1:51:17] a minimum 30 days brother venom told him
[1:51:20] minimum 30 days the dead on christ will
[1:51:22] rise before us and be with us minimum of
[1:51:24] 30 days
[1:51:24] those are his words praise the lord amen
[1:51:27] 30 40 days
[1:51:30] and then we go home to be with the lord
[1:51:33] but to realize what god has already done
[1:51:36] and brought it through and brought us to
[1:51:39] offering if that just you want to feel

[1:56:33] and uh god richard bless you uh as
[1:56:35] you've noticed we've got a few things
[1:56:37] that
[1:56:37] we still want to do here um we just
[1:56:41] i it wasn't verbally spoken but
[1:56:44] um we we kind of almost brother angel's
[1:56:47] done a lot of work past couple weeks
[1:56:50] uh on painting and the carpet the floor
[1:56:52] and different things
[1:56:54] but and me and brother roger did with
[1:56:56] putting and wiring up the lights all the
[1:56:57] lights and the wiring
[1:56:59] you see me and him did all that and the
[1:57:01] switches and the receptacles
[1:57:03] and we haven't got it all done yet but
[1:57:05] um most of it is to this point so
[1:57:08] but we just kind of you didn't any of us
[1:57:10] say anything about it but i think it
[1:57:12] just kind of became a week off last week
[1:57:14] where we just didn't do anything
[1:57:16] uh as far as the church concerned we
[1:57:17] still worked very hard
[1:57:19] a lot uh this week but
[1:57:22] we still have molding to put down around
[1:57:24] the bottoms um
[1:57:25] we still have the ceiling tiles we still
[1:57:27] have to put the i guess is everybody
[1:57:29] comfortable were you comfortable
[1:57:30] yes wasn't too hot or okay because we
[1:57:33] still
[1:57:34] there's air coming out of this vent
[1:57:35] there's air coming out of a vent over
[1:57:37] there
[1:57:39] so we need to run those get those hooked
[1:57:41] up and run those across and drop down a
[1:57:43] couple of places in here
[1:57:44] and put the tiles in and
[1:57:47] put the ceiling tiles in and we're going
[1:57:50] to do something with that door and
[1:57:52] uh build a sound booth back there and
[1:57:54] brother rogers gonna get a couple of
[1:57:56] uh streaming cameras to hang on to mount
[1:57:59] to the walls back there
[1:58:00] uh for streaming in a sound booth and uh
[1:58:03] brother
[1:58:04] zach has donated and i'm donating a uh
[1:58:08] a monitor a tv that we're gonna mount
[1:58:11] uh probably gonna mount one about um
[1:58:15] just right about three foot on the other
[1:58:17] side of my right there we'll probably
[1:58:18] mount one up there and we'll probably
[1:58:20] mount one over here
[1:58:22] probably about right here uh so
[1:58:25] to broadcast the words on or pictures or
[1:58:27] whatever we
[1:58:28] want to uh so we won't need songbooks
[1:58:31] anymore
[1:58:32] now we just got to find somebody can run
[1:58:34] the sound booth i know mike
[1:58:36] can do it but he can't do everything so
[1:58:39] maybe he can teach somebody i don't know
[1:58:41] but so there's going to be a little
[1:58:42] sound booth back in the corner we kind
[1:58:44] of have a little bit of limited space
[1:58:45] but there's a little bit a little bit
[1:58:47] more room
[1:58:48] for chairs and stuff if we need to
[1:58:51] but we're going to put i think you're
[1:58:53] going to put curtains like this over the
[1:58:54] door and
[1:58:56] leave that door there but put a film on
[1:58:58] it where you can see
[1:59:00] in but you can't see into the back room
[1:59:03] so if anybody's in there wants to you
[1:59:05] know hold their child or something and
[1:59:07] still watch and participate a little bit
[1:59:09] you can still see in here
[1:59:10] but we won't be able to see back into
[1:59:12] there and all that's
[1:59:14] going to be cleaned out still yet
[1:59:17] but brother nat sister teresa anybody
[1:59:19] know you know
[1:59:20] nathaniel and teresa garcia
[1:59:24] you'd know him if you saw him i'm sure
[1:59:26] because they went to tabernacle years
[1:59:27] sister
[1:59:28] sister teresa was really good friends
[1:59:30] with the miles so
[1:59:31] you'd know him to see him i'm sure but
[1:59:33] anyway they're the ones that on the
[1:59:34] actually lucy behar
[1:59:36] owns the building and when brother mike
[1:59:39] died this was his
[1:59:40] uh insurance office years ago where he
[1:59:43] had his farmer's insurance out of it and
[1:59:45] those of you came in before
[1:59:46] almost everybody in here said maybe
[1:59:48] sheila and lydia there was an
[1:59:50] offensive uh wall that went over here
[1:59:52] and down to there and it was
[1:59:54] there was one you see these right here
[1:59:56] there was a wall that went out there and
[1:59:58] then
[1:59:58] down to that wall and it was office here
[2:00:00] office there throw everything out tore
[2:00:02] the ceiling out
[2:00:04] um basically done everything all over
[2:00:07] again
[2:00:08] so it's become what it is and it's very
[2:00:11] nice i like it
[2:00:12] a little tight especially for a pastor
[2:00:15] who is expecting this congregation to
[2:00:17] continue to grow
[2:00:18] it's kind of tight right now but with
[2:00:21] the
[2:00:22] kobe thing going on and some folks still
[2:00:24] staying at home just streaming
[2:00:26] it's we have a it provides a little more
[2:00:30] room so
[2:00:31] anyway so michael all this stuff will be
[2:00:33] moved
[2:00:34] back there eventually mike had donated
[2:00:36] his piano to the church so
[2:00:38] i appreciate that too but uh we still
[2:00:40] have a little bit more work to do but
[2:00:42] appreciate your indulgence and patience
[2:00:44] and
[2:00:45] uh appreciate the lord blessing us and
[2:00:47] helping us with this so
[2:00:49] god's been good amen but just give you
[2:00:52] an update remember
[2:00:53] uh the parking situation and all there
[2:00:55] should be plenty of parking there's
[2:00:57] there's probably
[2:00:58] five or six cars you can park in the
[2:00:59] back you can park along the sides
[2:01:01] and the parking lot over here is really
[2:01:04] uh the front and the front
[2:01:05] in the front there's maybe six or eight
[2:01:08] spots but just beyond that
[2:01:09] there's probably a 50 spot parking
[2:01:13] that we can use back in there so and you
[2:01:16] know
[2:01:17] never know if we can come up with you
[2:01:19] know
[2:01:20] maybe several hundred thousand dollars
[2:01:22] we could just buy the place
[2:01:23] it's for sale you ever know if anybody
[2:01:27] feels rambunctious
[2:01:31] you notice how they bought the
[2:01:32] tabernacle uh when the tabernacle came
[2:01:35] up for sale
[2:01:36] uh three or four people had the money
[2:01:38] and
[2:01:39] uh didn't donate it but loaned it to the
[2:01:41] church and uh
[2:01:42] brother greene then they bought the
[2:01:44] building there and fixed it up and
[2:01:46] over time the church paid those people
[2:01:48] back but
[2:01:50] anyway i don't think anybody has that
[2:01:53] kind of ability but you never know
[2:01:57] god has done stranger things brother
[2:01:59] john
[2:02:00] you know garber is a realtor he told me
[2:02:02] that the
[2:02:04] oro valley baptist i think it is up
[2:02:06] there was
[2:02:07] on oracle was trying to thinking about
[2:02:09] redoing their church and they
[2:02:11] had much money and a lawyer came to him
[2:02:15] and talked to him and they said well we
[2:02:18] were thinking about
[2:02:19] you know doing some upgrades and changes
[2:02:21] and whatever and he said oh okay
[2:02:23] he said well let me know what you need
[2:02:24] well it turned out
[2:02:26] a woman that had just passed away it was
[2:02:28] in her will
[2:02:29] through that lawyer that gave that
[2:02:31] church and they reinvented their entire
[2:02:32] place property for three million dollars
[2:02:35] wow three million dollars was given so
[2:02:38] god can do anything yeah he owns it all
[2:02:41] if he wants that that's fine if he wants
[2:02:43] this i love it i like this so i'm very
[2:02:47] happy
[2:02:47] we pay uh brother natan uh 600
[2:02:51] a month for the use of the place he
[2:02:54] didn't give it to us free
[2:02:56] but um but we you know we pay him six
[2:02:59] hundred dollars
[2:03:00] a month which is a little bit more than
[2:03:02] we were paying at the other place we
[2:03:03] were a hundred dollars a week over there
[2:03:05] uh so that's
[2:03:08] comes out to fifty two hundred dollars a
[2:03:10] year
[2:03:12] we're 600 a month here so it's 600 times
[2:03:16] 12 is what
[2:03:17] 7200 so not that much more in a year
