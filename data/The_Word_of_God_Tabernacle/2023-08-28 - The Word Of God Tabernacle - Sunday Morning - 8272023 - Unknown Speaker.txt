amen as you've noticed the brother sister Pat are with us today brother Pat went through a procedure a couple days ago where they cauterized some vowels and his around his heart or um I I don't know exactly how they do all that but anyway but he was planning on being in church but uh he wrote me a text earlier and said he was planning on coming but his veins are not cooperating he's bleeding internally and his thighs have turned purple so he needs to stay home and land lay in bed God bless you of course they're probably watching amen they usually stream when they're not here so and it serve to be prepared for brother Pat the situation Lord would just touch him and heal him completely from that situation amen the surgery to my knowledge as he wrote went really well and everything did good the doctors were happy so I said you I was surprised to even talk about coming anyway so did you stay home and you know recuperate it well you need five anymore things don't bounce back quite like they used to and especially when you're dealing with the heart just stay home and just rest and don't do anything you can just recuperate let your body recuperate so that's the way God made our bodies to be able to recuperate uh got to that place and I had to written down here was going to pray for her sister Sheila's trip coming up but she she uh wrote down some prayer requests here so I'll

call us home to be with him praise the Lord Jesus this world seems to be getting worse and worse it is getting worse and worse every day every time you look around amen the God keeps his children regardless of what the world's doing and going through God keeps his children yes amen praise the Lord let's turn the scripture now to Genesis chapter 3. we've got a couple more parts to get through last time we started on the seed of God got to running a little late so he called to ended the service so we'll just kind of try to pick up where we left off of the seed of God today the holy spirit this is the holy spirit Part 12 and it'll be the seed of God part two Genesis chapter 3 we will as we have been start there today let's just bow our heads for word of prayer if we could before we read the scripture Lord Jesus father we're certainly grateful again for another beautiful day that you give us thank you for your grace your mercy for your blessings your love for watching over us and keeping us every day Lord you promised that you'd never leave us or forsake us and Lord we've come to realize that to be the truth in our lives regardless of what we've gone through regardless of what's happened in life regardless of the bumps in the road and the hiccups God we know that you are always with us father we can feel your presence and know you to be here near with us Lord living through US showing through us that you are still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Lord may you continue to bless us and strengthen us through the remaining part of this service and Lord as we open the pages of this Bible this precious holy writ God as we read the words off of it may your Holy Spirit Lord just come in a powerful way Lord to let this word become a revelation to us and show us in here what should have us to see and know and draw us closer to you through it and make us more like you Lord in the image of this word in the image of Jesus Christ Lord to do that according to your perfect will in all of our lives that the world of know and see that you are still alive and living through us God that that token will be on display Lord that others would see that you are are still living in in this in this last day manifesting demonstrating showing yourself again Lord God just use us Lord use us in every way we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done thank you Lord for all the praise your reports thank you Lord that all the prayer requests are going to become praise reports because you are mindful of every one of them and you are mindful of us thank you Lord for your hand Upon Our Lives pray you bless the remaining part of this service as you have your way in it Lord may you accomplish in it what you would have to be done Lord through the speaker the hero like God let it be accomplished what you said it forth as we commit it to you now Lord bless those that are here those who may be watching in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21. unto Adam also into it also and to his wife uh did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them you'd be seated if you'd like amen I want to turn over to First John we kind of went into first John a little bit but I I cut it back a little thinking that we might could finish the subject from last week on the seat of God so we just read a verse but I want to go back uh first John chapter 3 and I will only begin the first verse this time uh since we have a little more time to integrate some other things that uh we could just teach here and show through the scripture uh solidifying this subject that we've been on this Earth the holy spirit it's just so vital to us you know I've said for many years that my Ministry I always try to Major on the Holy Ghost that's that's been the major that I've tried to propagate to the work the Lord's give me to to express no matter who I'm where I'm at or who I'm ministering to the the Holy Spirit that's the premier thing the thing that matters the most when Jesus said you must be born again yes uh that wasn't an allegory that was a fact that was that was the number one Paramount thing that every human should have if you expect to be a part of his family in that Rapture of course uh this last day so tried to Major on that and just and and probably do a very poor job of a lot of we're just on Part 12 of what could probably be a several hundred part series uh but uh there's many other things pretty much every bit of it just encompasses the Holy Spirit even when you go back into the Old Testament like we've done some in this teaching but I want to go back start first John we left off with Ephesians chapter one but we'll come back to that but I want to go back again and incorporate some of the things that I sort of skipped over last time uh beginning with first John the third chapter first verse we read and talked out of the ninth verse but I want to get to the first verse and go through this now remember it's the seed of God this is the subject to the context for today the seed of God now uh First John 3 1 behold what manner of love listen to this now behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God the sons of God or children of God if you will the children of God that we should be called the children of God not just called the children of God but look at how John follows this up uh be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now there's one of my favorite words right now are we the sons of God not just called but we are the sons of God now we are the sons of God a son or child of God Children of the of the Lord uh uh offspring of the Lord just comes to show the fact that you had to always be in God if you were ever a child of God you always had to be a part of God God gives us a little bit of explanation we'll go over to I was going to read this a little bit later but the Lord's changing this all up so we'll just follow it let's go over to Hebrews and look in Hebrews the seventh chapter in Hebrews the seventh chapter it talks about Melchizedek and it talks about Abraham's interaction with Melchizedek and how Abraham paid Melchizedek tithing he gave it 10 of all that he had all of his increase is what the tithing is the tithing is your increase uh 10 of the increase or what you receive that 10 percent that he had just got he gave to Melchizedek as a tithing and as that and as that was attributed uh by God to Abraham let's read what the scripture also says because this tithing that Abraham paid was not just attributed to Abraham amen uh seventh chapter 9 verse and as I may so say Levi also who receives ties because he was of course the levitical priesthood he was the priest of the children of Israel uh received ties paid ties in Abraham the only way that Levi paid tithes into the Lord look at the recognition that God is giving to Levi and acknowledging that he gives he gives Levi credit even though he wasn't there in the flesh like we are here he gave Levi credit for paying tithe to Melchizedek through Abraham even though Abraham is the one that paid it and you see about the actions and the reactions of of parents down from generation to generation to generation it matters what you do it doesn't just matter in your life it doesn't just matter in your children's life because Levi was the great grandson of Abraham great grandson you had to go three more generations to get to Levi from the time that Abraham paid ties to Melchizedek three more Generations God attributed to Levi the tithing that he paid no candidate to Abraham praise the Lord what does that signify to us he said well what are you going on about Newton well what it shows to me is God's acknowledgment of Levi always having been in Abraham even though it was just great great uh great grandson God attributed it to the great grandson of Abraham a tithing that Abraham paid praise God a signification that he was always there he was always a son or in Levi's case always a great grandson because he was in Abraham so you have to understand look at it and think about what God in God's mind because we in ourselves as humans and it's inherent in humanity that we see right here most of the time this is what we see we see acknowledge we work towards we think about what's right in front of us and but that's not that's and so to help us understand that's not how God looks at things that's not how things work in God's economy and the and the eternities of God it doesn't work that way God is an eternal being amen a spirit who is omniscient which means all-knowing God is omniscient or all-knowing he's also Eternal he's infinite so God doesn't look and see as us as finite beings just on the right here God knows the very end from the beginning he knows everything that ever would be how many uh brother Brown talked about how many gnats there would ever be on the earth Lord help me because of how many I've killed uh but I do my best to kill everyone I can see mosquitoes alike I do not like mosquitoes and I do not like gnats because they like me so much you think usually when someone really likes you you like them back not in this case they like me and they love to eat me up but I want to kill them as fast as I can find them but every night God knows every now that would ever exist and how much Tallow each gnat would produce that's the infinancy of God that's the omniscience of God the all-knowing of God so God doesn't look into things just right here okay Abraham hey praise God God's looking it all the way down to Levi and you think that's just an example because God doesn't stop there we have a scripture that talks about Levi attributed back to Abraham but we know that God looks on down to the lenients down to Eternity down through time so to be a to be attributed to Levi meant that Levi always had to be a son he had to be in Abraham for God to attribute that Taipei to Levi it just proves to us that Levi was already there as Abraham paid it he paid it on behalf of his entire posterity God just attributed it to Levi because Levi was a priesthood so if you are a child of God you always were a child of God you never were anything else in the mind of God always in the loins of God always in the thoughts of God always an attribute of God if you were ever a son so now it brings in the light John's say God the blessings of God that he has bestowed upon us to not only be called the children of God but to now be a child of God praise the Lord which means the seed of God was always there because it was the Seed of Abraham that produced an Isaac and through that seed that produced in Israel a Jacob and through that seed that produced a Levi that God attributed seedback seedback seed back to Abraham that paid that tithing that seed was already there praise the Lord and if it was the seed of God that was always there that brought down into human flesh and in you and I that shows that we are and now are the children of God Amen praise God by the seed of God the only way you can be a child of God is that you were in the the mind of God the loins of God as a seed as a thought as an attribute a part of God like we've said many many times the only way you'll ever be Eternal is that part of God that you are amen that attribute that God that that came out of God that is now who you are praise the Lord not you're born in sin-shaped need to become the world speaking lies but in there was that seed look as we continue to read now you can see the the infinancy of God see because God does not and the predestination of God getting a little ahead of myself but which we'll read in Ephesians in a moment the predestination of God because we know and remember God does not predestinate based on uh uh he bait he bases predestination based on his foreknowledge not on his will on his foreknowledge because he knowed all things would be amen that's how he predestinates that we would be the sons of God so it it comes it behooves us to understand that it's in God's power it is of God's Authority that whoever came as my son came out of my loins or out of his or out of theirs or so on and so forth that that that was there always there it was always there I was in my daddy's he was in his daddies and on back just like we are that part of God in God that God put here down through eternity down from the beginning of time all the way down the seed of God and then that lineage came the seed of God that's why you could know serpent seed has to be in the Garden of Eden because there's no way a cane could have come out of Adam could not have happened Adam was the seed of God and the seed of God could not produce a cane it had to be a different seed it had to be a different life and it was a serpent seed that produced a cane you notice after that and and his and his characteristics and his nature and what he did and how he was and how he uh what he did but now you look at what God did when he when he also again after the fall Adam knew his wife and produced a set the seed again of God's seed Adam and how he acted and what he did and how he lived amen there's a stark difference between the two and the same thing is true today there's a stark and it's getting more and more prevalent too the starkness of the difference between the true seed of God and the make-believer unbeliever or even the the amen look now beloved now now you know before I go let me read this I was gonna read this uh with this scripture so let me go ahead and read it it's the sea the Seal of God um are the the action messages who is this Melchizedek that brother Brown preached uh paragraph 69 he says but look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word the word what is a child of God what is God old saying yes a man's as good as his word amen God is his word he did he does not put this on paper produces unless he is backing it up it's a part of who he is I don't I don't hold this Bible up and say this is God this is not God but the word is uh is a form of who God is just like you are as good as your word amen he says but now look he says but you will never be the word unless you as a thought at the beginning what is that thought that's that attribute that's the scene you will never be the word unless you is the Fault at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in his thinking first praise God blessed beloved now are we called the sons of God now are we the sons of God praise the Lord and it does not yet appear look by this quote we just read it does not yet appear or manifest itself in invisibility it does not yet appear what we shall be as John wrote this but we know look now we know as he's writing as he has wrote to us and we know it now more than any generation has ever known it why because of a prophet because of a word because of the manifestation of the uh in this last days of Jesus Christ revealing himself to his people amen it never was so before up to this time now we as the Bride of receiving that that that others should longed for that in the scripture they had talked about they wanted to know this they wanted to see this but it was not to be in God even said seal it up till the end time that's today John says we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now has God made his appearance God through his word has made his appearance to this bride through the opening of those in this last days the opening of his word he has revealed himself to us he has let us see in the fullness not just in part I remember brother random said now uh the the reformers and Wes uh a Luther had a part and Wesley had a part but they didn't have all the truths remember when we talked about the where the scripture meets scripture he said this and had a little and this and her bring a little he said but it took a profit of this last days to reach out and say okay this is correct and this is correct and this is correct that little life that was shown for that day longing and knowing as John said that this day would come he knew he wrote it that this day would come that we would know because when we see him we shall see him as he is praise the Lord and he is the word now coupling with that quote how could you become the word unless you were always the word how could you ever be a child of God unless you are always a child of God you can't you have to have always been a child of God you had always have been the word that's why the word is becoming the the words becoming flesh the flesh become word now we in this last day are becoming into that very image because we have seen him as he is now I am looking for and longing to that day of the Corporal body and be there where we can see him in that capacity face to face but in the spiritual aspect the Lord has revealed himself to us now he has taken into a prophet open this word and God has revealed himself to you personally not through a prophet but the Revelation come to you personally amen the Revelation did not come through a prophet the truth of it did but the Revelation did not the Revelation has to come directly from God to you person amen that did not come through a prophet and God revealing that to you helps you see him and know him as he is that's why you could look at the word and say oh praise God that's why you look in things that you didn't understand or things that didn't uh come together quite right or something and and God just open it reveal it to you let you see him who who he is amen when Isaac when you when when a man and wife come together typically maybe there's a culture that does I don't know but typically the the man and the wife get to know each other before they're married don't they I there may be a culture where they come to the wedding and all of a sudden a woman just pops out from behind the door and says I do but I've never heard of that amen I've never heard of that nor is that how God does it God didn't do it in the way that he just popped out the door and said here I am we're married there has to be a relationship it has to be according there has to be a a coming together of of word to word so that the two could become one together before they ever get amen and God reveals himself so that we can know him so that he can reveal himself to us he's manifest himself so we can understand so that we can know that God by Revelation can bring in uh together as one amen as a seed of God look he said we shall we sh we know when he shall appear we shall be like him praise God why is there ever going to be around how's there ever going to be a wedding how was there ever a wedding how would there ever be a Rapture If he if we weren't like him remember God's brother Adam said he's not coming for a foreigner he's coming for himself amen well how would he ever come if we're not like him right it could never happen for we shall see him as he is and every man let's get down to this now and every man that hath this hope and him purifies himself even as he is pure whosoever commit his sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and he know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin now again I've said this many times I don't want to rewrite rewrite the word but the fact that he could take away our sin he had to have no sin that's the reason brother Branham said that's the reason that no other man known down through the time could even look on this book to to try to redeem in any way shape or form because we were all Sinners but he was not and because he had no sin he could take our sin praise the Lord whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you that he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sentence from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil even in the flesh to the bride to the bride even in the flesh now we still make mistakes and do things wrong and sin and miss the mark many times we have in life that we want to do but that's attributed to the devil not to us amen when you repent where does that go brother bear said it goes back on the head of Satan where it originated amen amen the devil and now God came to destroy the works of the devil where in you not in the cosmos The Works of the devil continue on in this Cosmos it will be destroyed that's another part of it it will be destroyed but in us now the works of the devil have been destroyed it has no effect on you has no binding on you at all praise the Lord that's why you can look and say God has redeemed me God has set me free because it has no bearing on you God has set you free praise the Lord now you are the very righteousness of Jesus Christ himself oh how could I be the very righteousness of Jesus Christ because he took your place so you could take his well if you've took his places he not the very righteous almighty God brother Brown didn't miss the Mark when he said we fall way below our privileges things yeah amen that's the truth yeah last first on my first whosoever is born of God does not commit sin we talked about that last week or last time born of God does not commit sin where does he not commit sin in the place of the new birth where is that in the soul this is the mark makes mistakes the flesh the spirit but the soul of man were the spirit now of God dwells where he is Born Again cannot sin God Almighty cannot attribute sin over top of the token cannot do it amen no more than Jesus Christ himself was a sinner when he was here could not be was not did not nor can God attribute sin over the over the token can't do it amen when that soul is sealed the seals got in seals the devil out praise the Lord now you can no longer sin there's no sin in there that's that belongs to God for you now look again we went over this a little bit last week whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his God's seed remaineth in who me you God seed remained it wasn't just place there it was always there and it's still there it's now just found it's betting ground what was the betting ground the word yes I'm very sore it's like the the the the parable of the sower that we read last week or last time that that Parable what was it that that was that was planted God planted that seed in the ground so that it would bring forth life when this seed that remains in him was there it was it was always there just dormant and that word brought that spirit that came in the Holy Ghost and Fire brought it to life so they could live and when he burned out that old nature and the spirit of God came in to live in there it made you a new creature sealed that spirit in there now there can be no sin attributed to you none because that's the real you yes this is not the real me right this is just a Time body I'm housed in for a short time that's human spirit is not me it's only there to keep this body alive if the human Spirit left me I would die this flesh would fall to the ground that's the reason it's in there but that soul is what's worth 10 million worlds yes that God is attributed to that seed remaineth in there then he can not sin so what sin then is attributed to you to those that are born again none zero why because of the seed of God praise the Lord that's our whole subject today because of the seed of God no sin attributed to you yeah again you make mistakes flesh spirit Miss Mark but that attributing that God would attribute that sin is not to you you repent that sin goes to the devil lays on until the day of judgment he is the one responsible for that remember when brother random talked that uh talked about that the devil chose to take the person's mind God chose the heart amen amen so in the mind others things the devil can try to do he has no place there but he can try the spirit imagination thoughts conscience all those things he can try to do but he cannot infiltrate anything that he does see that's not your fault it's not when the Devil comes and puts a thought in your mind something that is not correct a thought that misses the mark a sinful thing that's not your thought that's his thought amen he just put it in you he found a way a place somehow to put it in you you cast down reasonings you bring that thought captive to The Obedience of Jesus Christ who is attributed to that The Devil Is Right not you he was born of God cannot commit sin I wish we could get to where we understand that that and the truth of it the real uh the the revelation of it for his seed God seed remaineth in US and he cannot sin because he is born of God praise the Lord cannot sin because he's born of God you look at the Armenians you look at the Calvinists brother Ram talked about when it was on this side one was on this side he said but all of them have a truth but they straight aside from the truth that God gave him amen they took the light that they had for their day and they ran with it but as they ran just like every denomination they got off track and they got off track one went way over to this side and one went way over to this side but remember brother random said there is a truth that's in the middle between the two if you have and thank God for a prophet to take the truth from one side the truth or another and make it balanced to where it works in the scripture and that's what we're looking at that's what we care about in the balance of the scripture because if you take one line of thought it takes you away off that way you take another line of thought it takes you away off that way that's what makes denomination but if you take the Simple Pure word by revelation of it it keeps you right in the middle of the road what we find where scripture meets scripture then you've got all the word tying together amen all the word tying together just like hell is not Eternal we know we know hell is not Eternal but a lot of Christian people believe that there's an eternal hell they think that people are going to be burning for eternity and that's just not true amen it can't be true because there's only one form of eternal life and if anybody's in there Burning For Eternity that means they have eternal life or if they've got eternal life they're a god and how is God going to be burning in hell he didn't create it for himself he created for the devil and his followers so there can't be an eternal hell not to mention the fact that the Bible says that hell was created and anything that had a beginning has an ending amen it's that simple let's go over now First Corinthians amen First Corinthians not First Corinthians first uh Ephesians Ephesians the first chapter amen remembering now God is omniscient God is all-knowing God is all present God is all-powerful God is eternal God is infinite amen he predetermined predestinates based on his foreknowledge people in the world talk about it like they're in some trap or something I mean some I'm in a trap of some God well what they can't understand or have a revelation of is the fact that God already knew all of that down through the annals of time because he's eternal he's omniscient he not knows all things he knows all your thoughts he knows all your actions he knows all your Deeds of everybody anybody how could you how could you hide it from him then but people still have that thought but now let's go Ephesians chapter 1 verse 1. Ephesians chapter one verse one we'll start reading we read down through most of this last time but we'll go back again to the first to the first verse Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God now it wasn't Paul that made himself that this was by the will of God to the Saints which is our which are Ephesus hence the Ephesians book in the Bible and to the faithful in Jesus in Christ Jesus that's me that's you amen so this is as much to you as to anybody right Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ now I have a thought there but I'm gonna I'm gonna skip over that a lot of people will take a scripture like that and they'll try to make two Gods out of it amen but God's a Triumph being let me okay I am going to do this think about this for a second how many times has a person ever said or have you ever said I love you with all my heart mind soul spirit well I'm not for people I'm one person but I love you with my heart and my soul my mind God is infinite yes but he's one God but not like your finger he's one God in in different offices just like you're a human being in in uh you have three parts to you you also have many manifestations in your life I I'll just use me I am a son I am a human I am a male I am a husband I am a father I am a grandfather I I uh how many more could we go to attribute to ourselves just us amen that identifies but see none of those tell who I am because you could take those seven identifications and put them to a lot of people amen maybe even some here but Newton Benedict is my name let me say my name that identifies me as who I am praise the Lord that makes me who I am that doesn't make me two people it doesn't make me three people amen praise the Lord go on Grace been to you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ see we know what he means when he says that the world sees two different gods a lot of people blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ now it says God and Father now it's God and Father two different people well of course not hey man he's the God and the father you understand I hope this makes more sense probably I'm doing a horrible job of it but uh God and Father's not too different right God and Father of the Lord Jesus uh well is he Lord is he Jesus is he Christ you see people take it and they go to seed with it it's the same person it's the same God amen blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world as we read the scripture last week he chose us before the foundation of the world Amen what did that choosing do now it's different than our uh analogy that we have with Abraham and Levi because Abraham did not have a choice of of Jacob he didn't have a choice of of Levi he didn't have that choice he just sowed the seed it was God's choice it's always God's choice but when it comes to choosing you it was God's choice it wasn't just a matter of fact to say that you just came forth and God had nothing to do with it God chose and that's the difference when God chooses God is specifically specific uh special about who he chooses and he chose you praise the Lord now how fast how special do you feel that God chose you before the foundation of the world that we should be now where do you put predestination now amen predetermined he determined ahead of time amen we do that sometimes we don't do it so far out as uh thousands of years but sometimes we'll predetermine before we go somewhere that we're going to go to a restaurant afterwards we do that at work sometimes we'll come into work and uh we'll sit at lunch and we'll say where do you want to go for dinner uh I don't know we're we're eating now so why do we have to decide that well because if we don't we spend 15 minutes afterwards deciding and we end up going someplace stupid so let's choose now where we're going to go so we make a good choice and then and a lot of times we do and we predetermine that when we get off work we're going to go here to eat that we've already predetermined that based on criteria and circumstances God predetermined or predestined all of these things based on the fact that he knew what was going to happen from the beginning to the end how easy predestination is I just don't understand how people well I guess understand you still have revelation to understand it but now what they don't understand too is that God's predestination does not override your free will you are still a free moral agent predestination does not override that so when people say there is some kind of Trap by some man-made God that is so ungodly and false you are as free now as you have ever been or ever will be it's just that God already knows praise the Lord amen and that that's it's just that simple God already knows he's predestined because he already knows and the fact that somebody would say that just proves that that's what he already knew that you were going to say or that you were going to do or who you were going to be or where you were going to go or how you were going to live your life every single aspect of it if God knew every net and how much Tallow would make then how much would God know about every single one of us everything you think everything you'd go everything about it predestination it's easy when you understand it that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us he chose us before the foundation of the world so he can predestinate us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself now I told you that adoption we went through that whole huge series that we were on uh Cortaro of adoption is over 30 parts of adoption to understand that the adoption only brings into light the fact that we were that we were born in sin shaped in the equity come the world speaking lies it doesn't mean that you're someone else's child and God took you to himself does not mean that it just means that God you belong to God and God is placing you in that body where you belong amen it also brings to I to like to understand that in this country or at least it used to be that if you adopted a child you could never disinherit that child because and that is not true for a natural born child if they're your child from your ones you can you can disown them but if you take the conscious decision to adopt a child you could never disown that child because you made a specific decision that you were going to go through the process and pay the money or whatever you had to do to bring that child into your family you can you could never disown that child praise the Lord I just love the spiritual aspect even when you look at the physical application and even some of the laws that that man has put down it echoes that God looks down and says see there amen that's exactly the truth predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen now his predestination he doesn't predestinate based on his will but his predestination of his foreknowledge Works through his Works to his perfect will amen so even if we do sometimes end up in God's permissive will we still end up in in the place if we're children of God in that perfect will of God Amen amen amen to the praise of the glory of his grace where he has made us accepted into beloved in whom we have received Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace and see Saints all of this the choosing the predestination the Redemption All that all that whole flow of of God's plan is working through that seed every every aspect of this plan this flow of light that God is bringing through through Paul's description to the Church of Ephesus he's showing that entire flow is nothing but going right through the seed of God he chose you because you're a seed of God he predestinated you because you're a seed of God he redeemed you because you're a seed of God his he reveals himself to you because you're a seed of God he gives you an inheritance because you're his seed amen praise God all these blessings God gives us is simply because we're his seed amen we're from his lenience we're from his loins we belong to him and always have belonged to it yeah we may not have always known it sometimes we may not have wanted it but we've always been a child of God yeah the prodigal son was always his son he never was not a son he was always a son even though it was a time in his life where he didn't want to be a son he wanted to go and live his life and do whatever he wanted to do he didn't want his daddy but there come to the place and time where he came to himself and he realized well if I could just go back and just have a little morsel of what my my my dad's Butlers in major eating I'd be a happy person he came back home and his dad fell on his neck and said welcome home my son praise God kill the fatted calf and let's have a party and be happy cause my son it was gone and now he's home my son not my stranger my son praise the Lord I think a lot of people in this world need to remember that yes a lot of people in this world need to understand that praise God my son or my grandchild I think it's a disgrace I'm not I'm I'm not going to call any names but I think it's a disgrace that a grandfather would not acknowledge his grandbabian that is absolutely immoral inhuman and ungodly and I'll leave that there I that that just creams my corn I hate that to how how could anybody uh uh disown their own flesh and blood uh let's move on in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the richness of his grace wherein he hath abound toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure that he has purposed in himself good pleasure in himself how is it purposed his or knowledge is for he pre-purposed through his foreknowledge he predetermined through his foreknowledge praise God sometimes we predetermine that we're going to a certain place for dinner after work and after we eat that food we get indigestion that might not have been the wisest choice but God doesn't do that because God knows this choice is going to lead to this result and that result is going to be the best thing that you could hope for in your life praise God it won't give you indigestion amen because God knows I might not know but he does yes he that's why he predetermines it that way that's why we fuss and fight and Pull and pushing we God why God why God's got a purpose and a reason for all of it and some of it is hard some of it is very grating on the human flesh and spirit but it all works to a greater work of God we just love him remember all things work [Music] amen yeah you all know the scripture you probably all can quote it it all works together amen for our good because we love him amen let's continue on that in the dispensation the fullness of times he might gather together uh gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have a pain and inheritance an inheritance why because we're his children we are his seed being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom uh in in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word truth Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with a holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of your inheritance the down payment until the Redemption the full possession the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory of Romans 8 23 to the full Redemption that God's word of we're not full we're redeemed but the claiming of that Redemption the fullness of the claiming of that Redemption hasn't taken place yet yes our souls our bought God's filled us with his Spirit but this body is still subject to the elements of the world but when this body receives a new body when this body is changed we go on a Rapture the consummation just like that yeah amen it'll be complete because we belong to God we don't belong to someone else we belong to god let's look at this [Music] um let me see if I can find here thinking man's filter he said there is a real filtration of the sin of the world and the love of the world is dead this Soul this Soul he's pointing here this soul is drawing only one thing here it is don't forget it all you out there on the telephone said it in your mind when a thinking man begins to think who he is going uh who is going to stand before and and uh the word of God and what the word of God is when he begins to think then he draws through that there's nothing can get through get to it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning germ seed word from the beginning amen from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning standing there drawing the seed life the seed is in your heart this listen now First John 3 9 the seed is in Your Heart by four ordination always there amen praise God remember we talked the other day I had I've had people tell me oh it only came in there when you believed it only came in there and you're baptized no no no no that is not scripture it was there always there and it remained there brother random said that word that was in you was God at the beginning staring here drawing that seed light the seed is in Your Heart by four Nation Hallelujah the seed is already in there already in there by the four knowledge of God predestinated predestinated that is that word that people don't like to hear but it's the truth amen predestinated God predestinating by that word putting it in your heart now we'll close here first Peter to read this scripture first Peter chapter 1 verse 23 First Peter chapter 1 verse 23 being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever born again of Incorruptible seed the seed of God you only seed that's Incorruptible not of corruptable seed what is the corruptible seed I was born of a corruptable seed by Humanity by the fall in the beginning of the Garden of Eden the reason I came to this world uh sinner-speaking lies and that's the reason I came how the reason why or how I came into this world through that in for that through that corruptible seed so the differentiation that people draw now is the difference between a corruptible seed and an Incorruptible seed is the difference in understanding First John 3 to where there is a sin that's not sin and then a sin that is sin or missing the mark the difference between corruptible seed and Incorruptible seed the corruptible seed will continue to do things through this sticky flesh the corruptible sea will continue to do things all through life that they shouldn't do or shouldn't think or how they shouldn't act but The Incorruptible seed will never ever disbelief never ever miss the mark because it is that Incorruptible seed that we are born by that is our new birth or our born-again experience being born again of Incorruptible seed now you see as John takes on well the Holy Spirit working through Peter and John that bring to light this exact same thing to help us understand the difference between an Incorruptible seed and a corruptible season the difference between the missing the mark in your flesh or knowing that you cannot sin in your soul because you now belong to God 's seed is in you and you cannot sin because God cannot sin praise the Lord but you're going to continue to make mistakes do things you shouldn't the difference between what John is talking about and what Paul and what Peter is talking about they're bringing the both together in life so that we can understand them amen it's the seed of God drawing from the seed of God the seed of God is The Incorruptible seed praise the Lord that's who we are that's who God is made of That's Where We Belong amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could The Incorruptible seed is the seed of God the corruptable seeds are human seed or human life amen when God said be therefore perfect he didn't mean that you would ever in this body ever be uh sinless say to miss the mark we miss the mark all the time amen but God's Incorruptible seat overrides that so that we ourselves remember ourselves that's our soul is ourselves not this thing is is sinless we're sinless I could say Newton been it's sinless but that Newton identifies this flesh but the real me who I really am is yeah because that real me and who I really am is only a part of God praise the Lord no wonder it can be sinless because it's it's part of God yes amen it's the seed that remaineth in US that seed is is God's seed praise the Lord amen I'm so thankful God still remains in us and proves that he is still the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God [Music] let me find this course I'm trying to find I sometimes I usually remember where something is in the book but I don't remember exactly number here we go [Music] amen I wanted that other one pardon me for a moment um 405 that's what I want to see 405. warned born born again thank God I'm born again amen praise the Lord that's exactly what John was talking about born again thank you Lord that's exactly what Jesus was talking about born again that's what we have to be born again amen not a corruptable seed but an Incorruptible seed praise the Lord Jesus 405 let's sing it born again thank God I'm born again born born born again thank God I'm born again [Music] I'm born again [Music] thank God I'm born again [Music] is born again [Music] [Music] one more time now PS4 God lord again thank God I'm born again [Music] thank God our Lord again lord of the water spirit and nothing but I'm born again [Music] amen thank God I'm born again Amen Hallelujah by the Spirit by the blood being born again now I belong to Jesus yes and amen I'm all his praise the Lord amen God bless you today pray something was said to bless and strength in some way today amen I appreciate God's goodness again word is so beautiful so real so true just bring us into that Focus God revealing himself to us amen and I had to I don't remember exactly so brother Rogers having some meanings this week that I wanted to bring your attention but I have to find it because I didn't remember us it starts and it starts Wednesday and ends Monday [Music] August 30th he's having a church dedication Services uh starting August 30th which I think is in that Wednesday [Music] okay so Wednesday night August 30th through September 2nd uh which is Saturday night is at seven o'clock at night September 3rd which would be Sunday is 10 30 a.m and 5 P.M and Monday which is Labor Day September 4th they'll have a service at 11 30 A.M amen so if anybody wants that flyer the information I'll send it to you uh but just remember Wednesday through Monday he's having Services uh Wednesday through Saturday be at 7 p.m Sunday 10 30 which we'll have service here but 10 30 and 5 o'clock and Monday 11 30 A.M so remember those services in prayer if you would if you can't go if you can't go good I Lord will and I plan on making a couple of them if I can got a little busy week but I believe the Lord will just make a way so but if you want to if you need more information on our where is church is I know Sister Matisse has been there let me know I'll send you the flyer and you can desire to go be a part of you can't again pray for him if you would and also as I mentioned earlier next Sunday fly out at 1 30 ish so I'll need to bump the service up next week to 10. instead of 10 30. so next week will be 10 o'clock and from what I can see we're supposed to go to Salt Lake City for the next two jobs uh Salt Lake City this the Labor Day week and then the next week will be there but for some reason I don't know usually usually Airlines have flight patterns flight I shouldn't say patterns but schedules but it's so different I had to uh Delta is the main Hub in Salt Lake and there's non-stops from Tucson to Salt Lake but the last one they have Sunday is 11 30. so I've got to fly united through Denver over to Salt Lake but then the next Sunday they have a 5 PM Delta has a 5 PM flight that goes straight to Salt Lake so I don't I don't understand how all that works but uh anyway so they're after next Sunday at least for the next three or four weeks it shouldn't have any problems as far as changing service times or anything like that so but remember next Sunday uh 10 o'clock we'll have service here 10 o'clock so remember that remember brother Rogers services in prayer if you would and I believe that's all I had I believe that's all the announcements I had so amen last appreciate the Lord's goodness this last week Micah testified was testified about his trip on uh last week was this past week was pretty hard week the week ones are always hard it was a very physical the conveyor all the tunnel equipment everything is very physical week so it's very taxing in and out of the pit welding uh my arm looks like I got chickenpox again I got so many burns on my arm from off the wealthy so it was it was a rough week but the flights were beautiful flights were all ever for all four of them was on was early no turbulences the weather was good like Micah said the weather was so good the Lord
