11 praise the Lord Jesus Matthew 11 so thankful the Lord is mindful of us amen amen so thankful he does not withhold from from us but he promised to reveal himself unto Babs praise the Lord Jesus amen he's still the same today amen praise the Lord Matthew chapter 11 then we we read beginning with the 25th or just read the 25th verse amen Matthew 11:25 before we do we just bow our heads for another

way if you ever did it through your scripture if you ever met it one through for one person Lord you've got to do the exact same way again or you're not God we believe you Lord to be God and we know you are God and we know that you are the same so Lord may your Holy Spirit move in a special Supernatural way again on each and every one of us Lord may your Holy Spirit come forth with a with the word today to reveal it to our hearts and show us in there what we'd have to see and know yes we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hind or filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done that you might accomplish what you would had set predestined this service to be for God for us and for the these people for us to be here Lord for those who may be watching God we just pre you predestined it for this purpose Lord it'll not return void Lord as you have purposed it let it be let it be unto us according to your will move oh God in us am we surrender ourselves to you in every way father Soul Mind Body Spirit yes in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Matthew chapter 11 and then Matthew 11 verse 25 and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto B praise the Lord you could be seated if you'd like amen want to go back over to Revelation chapter 6 where we left over last week uh I'm not going to go back to the others that we have read but we do want to keep in our hearts because it will continue to flow through this uh probably as I was looking at it and studying it on it this week uh probably another two more services on this one uh topic of false teachers amen praise the Lord this is God Simplicity part seven amen false teachers part two amen so just keep in mind as we have read those scriptures uh for the past couple of weeks in Isaiah over revelation 19 about that sharp sword going out of the mouth of the Lord as we know of and identified and we can see plainly in the scripture simply means the word of God Amen the word of God the sharp powerful sword that cuts coming and going that that that is the word of God the same uh word of God the same uh sword that uh that gives the believer blessing and hope and and and all the the things that all the bless the benefits of God we have amen it's the same thing that is the cursing to those who do not believe to those who reject it amen and you can see that in plentiful uh in the world today we ended off on Revelation chapter 6 I want to go back there again we ran we read kind of read through the uh the uh the seals the other day and seeing in this and trying to identify finding in the identification of the scripture where the auth authority of these false teachers comes from where do they get the authority to bring false teaching amen we found out as we read through and I'll just read through without commentary maybe just one more time as we're Revelation chapter 6 verse one and I saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four bees saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer the crown was given him amen didn't earn it didn't inherit didn't deserve it it was given to him amen now and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second be say come and see then went on another horse that was red and power was given to him again not earned not deserved but given to him power was given to him that set there thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was also given unto him a great sword amen a great sword was given unto him we recognize that obviously as he's coming into the church as we talked about last week and he's infiltrating into the birth of that true church that began on Pentecost and he began to to bring forth through the crown and the authority and then the power the word amen he had authority to bring the word the the sword that was given to him amen notice this word is not withheld from anyone but the truth of this word the revelation of this word is withheld from those that do not believe will not believe amen and those that come to believe those that are given to them by this sword by this uh by this riter through the ones that he's been been able to work in down through time as he still has subjects that he can work through today it may not be as like it was the Catholic Church down to the church ages but he always has someone some group people ministers Amen to work through and he's still working today but his working is with this sword amen he's taking what he's been given and he's using it praise the Lord given unto him a sword one deserve wasn't earned none of that was given to him amen why was it given to him God is God had a purpose to established on this Earth and again as we said and as we quoted brother brandom you realize that that seed that was birthed forth there had to go into the ground it had to die and it had to rot before it could birth forth again a new bringing into this last day this last age this last time the end of the last age amen and all that the Satan had done through that time was to be exposed in this last day we talked about we'll get into the scripture in a minute uh so I'll probably reiterate it in a little more when we actually read it in the scripture but that time where it was where it was told to Daniel uh by God it was told to John the Revelator in Revelation 10 by God seal that up because it wasn't time amen well friend uh now is the time amen the revelation of that has been he has been exposed to who he was down Through the Ages as they've read this even up to the time that God showed this in 1963 to the prophet of God people still believe that that was Jesus riding white horse red horse black horse now that he's been exposed we know better it's the workings of the devil it's the workings of Satan amen Jesus did not have to have a crown given to him he did not have to have power given to him he did not have to have a sword given to him these were all of his possessions praise God because he was God built in flesh amen do you understand so it just further exposes the enemy amen down through time down through the church ages he is now been exposed we can and see that through the revelation of this word when he open the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld L A Black Horse He that on him had a pair of balances we talked about that in his hand I Heard a Voice a voice in the midst of the four beasts remember that's Jesus speaking out brother R Mak very clearly to understand that Jesus is the only one we went back to Revelation read there that Jesus the only one that had the authority to be able to speak as such to command that Spirit to be able to go and not go do and not do we talked about Job how God allowed job to do certain things but put limitations on it uh first it was job then it was don't take job's life you can touch job but don't take his life it was God giving him the ability to let him loose but with limitations this limitation here was when that voice went forth same one same God that told him up in heaven that he could have job same God given in that Authority here but then he tells him a measure week for a penny three measures of barley you weigh out the wealth of the world the Catholic Church the wealthiest organization on the planet but see thou hurt not my anointed see thou hurt not my oil and wine and we notice that's not a physical hurt hurting that's not the thing that God focuses on I I God blesses us friends God heals us God protects us God watches over us but it's not the physical thing it's the spiritual thing that God's concerned about the most our spiritual well-being amen and what is what his Proclamation don't you dare cause them to do those Hill Maries and things don't you dare cause them to commit spiritual fornication Against The God Who is her husband right amen leave her alone hallelujah praise the Lord none of these things when it opened the foral I heard the voice of the for Beast saying come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name it set on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword to kill with what the sword not a literal sword right amen but deception it was given to them to do so it was given unto this white red black now pale hor riter to do so the authority the power the sword to be able to do it was given by God so all this that takes place around the world and the questioning of of of of how can these uh the false teachers false prophets continue to move forward and and still continue to bring forth their their their uh damnable teachings how are they able to do it because they've been given the authority to do it right God gave them the authority and they still have that Authority today that Authority has not been revoked and it will be in place now see it's there all not not only to separate those that will miss don't believe but it's also there to test those that do believe right is there to test us on the true word are we going to believe the true real word are we going to let other things draw us other things take our attention other things uh uh uh draw us away from the true pure Holiness uh of the unadulterated word it's a test amen look now um let's continue power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword so we can know that that is a spiritual death not a physical death a spiritual death because the sword that we're speaking of that we know of that we've read all the way through the word being the word of God was given to kill so this is a spiritual death not a physical death right to kill a and to kill with Hunger so we got a spiritual death we've got a hunger because remember the scripture says there will be a time when well there will be a famine in the land yes but not a famine of bread and water but a famine Famine of hearing of the pure unadulterated word of God Amen a famine yes people starving people uh hungry for the word of God people wanting that word in their hearts striving in their hearts to want to hear a pure unadulterated word to to to see a real God moving in a amongst the people amen there'll be a hunger we see it today yes the hunger is just as real today as we know cuz this is that last time because this pale horse rider rides on into predition it goes through this age it goes after the bride is gone and continues on even after the bride is gone and taken home it continues on right amen and it continues on doing the exact same thing that it has always done thank God that that it would be so close it would deceive the very elect now so close but it cannot deceive the very elect right impossible for the elect to be deceived because she has become the word and it's impossible to deceive the word with the word yes amen amen amen so they kill them with the sword and with Hunger the famine and with death and with the Beast of the earth now you see there's a great now there's probably maybe I don't know I haven't looked at statistics lately but as much or more people filling uh uh Christian churches around the world than there's maybe ever been amen probably of course in the United States even though you see the the anti-christian move going on you see a lot of the biggest churches ever assembled 10 20 30,000 members in this country ass assembled buying stadiums uh uh sports stadiums to be able to seat everybody there's so many of them and even with and even with a sports Stadium they still have to have two and three services every day just to have all the people filtered in and out amen more than ever but what does that mean that just means there's more death right when the pure word of God is not there not presented not uh preached then what do you have you have death yeah amen amen that's why Jesus cried out Revelation 18 come out of her my people do not be partaker of her sin what is her sin her sin is unbelief yes sin means to miss the mark what is missing the mark unbelief of the word of God and Jesus God cried out come out of her to be not partaker of that death that's why the bride is separate that's that's why she's been called out that's why she's an elected Group by God handpicked and Jesus said no man can take them out of my hand praise the Lord if they are predestined of God and they're Ed in the palm of God's hand nobody can take them out praise God praise the Lord Jesus I don't care what the circumstances look like I don't care where they are I don't care if they haven't darkened the door of a church in 30 years that makes no difference that all right they're still in the palm of Jesus hand and no one not even the devil can pluck them out amen praise God yes now you see where this death comes from it comes from false teaching amen false teaching of the word that they have been given they've been given the word to be able to do that with the authority doesn't come from their Seminary The Authority does not come from their denomination The Authority does not come from the those who sit and listen their Authority literally comes from God who gave it to them and allowed it to be so right and God allows it to be so today amen but thank God the bride cannot be deceived amen she cannot be deceived now I want to go over to Revelation uh to uh 2 Thessalonians and I want to I want to get through this and this will probably take the rest of the service and then next week uh I want to get and make it very personal I'll just tell you Saints next Sunday the Lord willing will be very personal I'm not going to call names or anything like that like brother Brown talked about or like Paul did in the scripture No it's none of that it's just finding out looking out here today whom of you feel like you could be deceived Deed by the Catholic church today whom of you think you could even be deceived by the Baptist church today or denomination then where's the deception it's not out there amen next week it'll get very personal 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 I want to begin reading at verse one amen Revelation uh 2 Thessalonians chap 2 ver1 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him now look at this exhortation that Paul gives this is extremely important that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter now the word and letter may sound like the same thing but it is not amen it's literal Spirit God logos amen and Rama letter word praise the Lord Paul's saying do not be deceived in any manner don't be trouble don't be troubled in your spirit don't let anyone deceive You by word or by letter amen by lost by word by Rama don't let don't let you be deceived don't be troubled about it amen and I say that so many times and I've heard and seen so many people uh that that has has caused that people begin to fret and wonder and worry over certain things even certain people ask me questions well so and so said such and such I said I I cannot vouch for that person's Revelation all I can do is preach what God gave to me that is why amen that is why God only called One Pastor to Pastor over people a person a group yes amen God did not ordain six pastors to Pastor that one person he didn't do it you find me in the scripture anywhere where God ever said that or where brother randam says it he's brother Ram says stand by your pastor singular yes but now you got today you can go on and listen on line and you can hear this one and that one you can hear us amen but I try to tell people look it's like brother ROM said he said brother if you don't believe this if you don't want your congregation then then then this is not for you this is for my church this is for my people and I'd say the same thing amen if somebody listens somebody watches this is for the group that calls me Pastor amen not another brother Pastor not somebody else in the city somebody comes listen to this and and listen to somebody else and say well is that your pastor amen I had someone in Florida that that was like I said well if that's your pastor then you need to move there and support that group with your TI and attendance right am amen well there's so and so and such I said you come up with all kind of excuses you want but if God's called that person to be your pastor you need to go support them you need to go support that church you need to attend that church give your tithe amen tithe and offering cuz that's how you support church that's how brother B said you support a church amen he said your tithe offering in attendance yes it's that simple but God did not ordain for any one of us to have four five six pastors he's only called one amen amen one to be your pastor now it's not now this doesn't mean that you don't listen to other ministers I'm not saying that I'm not trying to niiz this at all uh you any of us is more than welcome to any but you don't take the word of someone that you hear as a minister or something that somebody recommended and say you should listen to this message that doesn't that doesn't mean that person's your pastor amen and I've had people come in question and say well what about this and what about that you know you can only go into the word of God and all I can say a lot of times is I can't vouch for that brother's Revelation I can only vouch for what the Lord has showed me am I can only preach what God's given me yeah that's all I can preach that's all I know it's all I'm going to preach anyway I could probably preach more than that but I'm I'm only going to preach I learn my lesson I told y'all that on that I'm only going to preach what the Lord puts in my heart to preach right amen and that's it praise the Lord and if that and if God calls you to somebody else and that's between you and him amen that's between you and him praise the Lord but now don't be troubled see by word or letter cuz you know as we have read that there was many men in this day that were bringing false Doctrine they were trying to deny Jesus Christ how do you do that by denying the word and they were trying to preach a different gospel to people and they were trying to twist the words of truth that have been revealed to Peter Paul the disciples they were trying to trst twist those words and Paul called them people out he called a few out anyway by name and said these people are preaching false Doctrine they're causing people to go astray and believe something that's not true amen and those are people that become troubled now now Paul is saying but don't be troubled we've told you the truth I've preached you the truth I've demonstrated to you the truth what else can I do amen don't be troubled by word or letter uh uh as from us amen as that the day of Christ is at hand Paul said that 2,000 years ago amen the day of Christ is at hand how much more can we say that today how much more has that become a realization and a revelation to us today amen it means much to us more to us than cuz we know now is the time God's about to come take this bride home amen now he's he's getting into this part we talked about in Revelations now let no man deceive you by any means no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come what day the day of Christ right that is at hand that day shall not come or will say fully come in its completeness except which excuse me which culones and a body change for us and a Rapture amen all this winds itself up to to a body change to with the changing as of scripture Romans 8 it says to it the changing of our bodies amen amen that's the culmination where the bodies changed we go home to meet the Lord in the air amen amen there for this day shall not come except there come a falling away first Falling Away first and that the man of sin be revealed the son of predition now we know the son of predition we know the man of sin has already been revealed we went through that we talked about that just a few minutes ago in Revelation and going back again to Daniel uh Daniel 12:4 uh Revelation 10:4 that God stopped these great men from revealing and opening that portion because it wasn't to be revealed for them in that day it was only for this day amen it was only for this time and brother brandham even rebutted those people that thought that it was going to be something that was going to be an addition to the Scripture it was going to be a change to the scripture brother absolutely not cannot be a change to the scripture it cannot be a subtraction from the Scripture it cannot be an addition to the Scripture it has to be something that has been hidden there by God through ages and generations and times that was to be revealed we know 1963 March that this day that scripture was fulfilled amen praise the Lord amen we know now that that man of sin has been revealed this great falling away now we're talking about the day of Christ coming that there be a great falling away and that the man of sin be revealed now we know that we've seen the great man of sin being revealed what about this Falling Away what about this great falling away it talks about a uh they shall come except there come a come a falling away first oh what about that we we've already know this this uh the the son of sin the man of sin has been revealed the son of predition we know it's been revealed that's Satan the devil we know that what about this great falling away where people were to be leaving this uh by great numbers where have we seen that I me yeah we've had people leave the message uh I'm sure that people people in denominations have had the denominations themselves have had people leaving those denominations and going away and and maybe renouncing Christianity but I've heard a lot of stories where people I read one the other day where some woman she got so sick and tired of the new age stuff and wickery and all that she was a wicked and she got so sick and tired of the wiccan and the Wizardry all that she got so sick of the new age stuff and stones and energy rocks and what are all this she turned to Jesus Christ she gave her heart to Christ she got baptized now I don't know how it doesn't say because I guess the world doesn't consider that pertinent I do but she got baptized and she's now going to church serving the lord Jesus and says she's never been happier in her life she finally found this thing that she's been searching for her whole life and she was raised a Christian but she went off for searching for whatever she could find whatever was in her heart in her soul whatever she thought she needed she tried to get it in everything but Christ and when she finally can I say this she finally as a prodical son came to herself she she went to Christ and she's never been happier she says she finally found what she's looking for so we do have these people falling out what about the there's some that are coming in too me amen few people that are seeing this brother Roger went to a Home Depot the other day and theft is the way it is now ramp it everywhere nobody seems to care um it would appear as so anyway I shouldn't say nobody that's an absolute statement there are people that care but it would seem as though nobody cares so they have to lock everything up now especially wire so they have uh all the wire all the electrical wire is all is all caged up now so you got to go get somebody and that person has got to take it out of lock and key and take it over personally they can't hand it to you they have to personally take it over and stand there with you with the register person with the person checking you out and make sure you pay for that wire it is that it is that bad and this woman was the one that was doing it for him and uh they were walking over and she she started the conversation you've been doing this long I said yeah I've been doing this 30 years but it's only a side side job for me even though he does it a lot U every day this is a side job for me I tell the guys at work same thing for me my my manager keeps wanting me to become a manager I'm like this you got to understand this is not my main job this is not my main position in life um so if the Lord ever brought that about for some reason orever gave me the okay to do it I just uh I I don't want to get embroiled in that anyway but anyway so this lady and he says no but then she she says well what do you do she he says I pastor of Church he she turned around and looked at him says would you baptize me Sunday wow out of nowhere she baptized he baptized the woman that Sunday she's been coming to church ever since she was there last Sunday night when I when I preached we had communion foot washing she participated she was all part of it amen so it's not just the people like so so my question that becomes if if it's not so much that people are just leaving churches by the droves where is this falling away come from it's got to happen it's got to be happening now because we're that close right amen there got to be a spiritual falling away yes there's a spiritual Falling Away of people leaving the pure unadulterated word of God Amen not leaving churches not leaving Christianity but leaving the pure unadulterated word of God falling away to some man-made something or somebody who has devised something in their mind that they think it's an interpretation that they believe of the word and that is absolutely contrary to the scripture contrary to the message contrary to Jesus's writings cuz we know this isn't for personal interpretation this is for God to reveal it to his people and for us to see that and and to know that through this seventh angel Prophet messenger William Brandon that came to bring us a message to guide us along in that way that we hold dear that keeps us on that on that straight narrow the pure unadulterated word amen nothing mixed no manmade ideas no charismatic no denomination no uh no other church or men's ideas simply purely the word of God yes and it alone people leave falling away leaving and falling away they're not leaving church a lot of them still go to church people that have left the message people I know that have left the message pastors I know that have left the message they most of them they kept their churches they just told their people I just don't believe this anymore I'm just going to preach for the Bible preach what your interpretation of what you think the Bible says right where does it in Saints yeah we know where it begins yes they fall away not from Christianity but they're leaving off from the true pure word of God and that falling away my Saints is happening now it is still happening yes it's still continuing I used to go preach for Brother John Keith and Buford bless his heart he's passed away great man of God God his whole family except for his daughter and his wife left and moved when they heard some other somebody it's like my wife says she says why don't these people if they don't believe it anymore just leave just go leave just nobody needs to hear from you anymore you you don't need to Splatter all over social media how horrible William brandom was and how wrong this message is just leave but they can't do that that right they can't do that it's an anointing Saints yes it's an anointing that's on that person not just to look at something and say oh I don't believe that I'm just going to go do something else no they have to slander and Slaughter and be besmer and defame everything about it it it it's like a personal goal to them I'm not even going to tell you some of the things I've heard people say about brother Brown I don't I don't I didn't want to hear I even told a person told me I said look I don't want to hear that I I don't want to hear any any of that that anybody said and if and if a person feels they want to be informed to know these things that's fine that's to them I don't I don't but what I do know is I can find what's going on in the scripture and that's what I'm concerned with what does the Bible say about it we know what the Bible says about it not just here but in other places we're just talking about it here we just read a portion of it in Revelation as well it's going to continue on that way Saints amen because this last day brother random talked about one in a million amen now he wasn't talking about one in the million as the bride he was talking about one in the million as like an alive and remain group those that's going to be at the end when this Rapture really takes place it's going to be a small number yes it doesn't it doesn't discourage me I'll be honest with you now I've always felt that things that the Lord has put on my heart and that's been just between me and the Lord there's other people that are that should be coming here that's but that's between them and God right I don't get discouraged with small numbers amen it's always been small numbers in the Bible yes Jesus he chose 12 disciples not 10,000 he always the the reference to home churches fear not little flock it's always small that's not making an excuse because we have a small church that's just the truth right that's just a fact and that's not discounting any larger churches or any churches that have uh uh you know hundreds of people or thousands of people I'm not discounting those people that's between them and God I'm just saying what the scripture says that's what I'm obligated to say what does the Bible say a great falling away or that day shall not come except there come a falling away first it's not people leaving Christianity it's people leaving the the the truth people falling away from the pure unadulterated word amen I haven't heard any Rumblings about when that brother Billy Paul's passed away I think probably as old as Billy Paul was that a lot of people those that probably already had it settled in their hearts maybe uh whatever it is they want to excuse about that or think about that or the prophecy they held and however that is people have to work that out PE you the Bible says to work out your own salvation right you just better do it with fear and trembling amen that's the part A lot of people leave off they say well the Bible says work out your own salvation it does but it says but with fear and trembling reverence to God right trembling Amen to make sure that you know you are where you're supposed to be in the Lord Jesus now let's continue or I'll never finish this that man of sin be revealed the son of predition we know that has happened look who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God Seth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God Amen exactly Isaiah 14 we can go back and read it but you can read it on your own we know it probably some of us by heart Satan's Proclamation that was described in Isaiah by Isaiah of his desire to want to be exalted of God to be worshiped like God to be the one that people look to that people worship amen he wanted to be that one he thought he was going to be that one amen and now we know and we can see in the scripture that he opposeth and exalteth himself above he exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he as God listen to this now he Satan as God sth in the temple of God the churches showing himself that he is God what is God God is an object of worship amen he has always wanted to have that worship that position to be exalted above the true Living God as God showing himself that he is God look at what brother random said about that if I can find it here amen C now this God of this evil age civilization knowledge perverts God's word to suit their own taste they pervert God's word to suit their own tastes every denomination does the same thing and that's not just saying that just because they have Baptist or Methodist or Catholic or something not just that but anything that sets under a denominational spirit is a denomination anything that sets under a nickan denomination spirit is the denomination whether they've T Tabernacle to it Temple to it or they or or or Baptist or Methodist or whatever if it sets under a denominational ncol it's in spirit it's a denomination every denomination does the same thing Satan look now in that church Satan now then preaches his own Gospel of knowledge where preaches his own and now how is he doing how is Satan preaching finding subjects to work through yes finding subjects that'll believe his Li that'll hold to his twisting of the word of God to find those that will be willing to for whatever reason money well brother Brown said money women popularity those are the three things brother Brown talked about amen whether it be one or all however Satan does it amen garnering these people to preach whatever have a big crowd uh to pull in a big church pull in numbers pull in money be popular look look look like the most important or the best amen look friend in the economy of God numbers does not denote best right right amen again going back to what we said a minute ago far from it scripturally far from it look now but he says now Satan Satan using vessels Satan preaches his own Gospel of knowledge a perversion of the word and it can be so much as 99% word right we know that cuz brother BR say that's what he did in the garden of Ed Eve brought her 99% truth but that 1% defiled the whole Humanity the only whole human race amen started the ball rolling anyway that perversion preaching his own Gospel of knowledge where in his own church mine that's why aabad written over the door yes why because God has left this place yes that's what aabad means God has left this place who's in charge not the pastor Satan the devil's in charge when God leaves there's only one other denom dominating Spirit to take over and that's the devil yes that's the only thing that's left all of us are just puppets just going along people are just with whatever their influence is I would just want my influence to be the almighty God Amen not the devil any deviation off the word whether it's my idea or someone else's or some denomination or some Seminary it needs to be what the word of God says brother bam did not come with an interpretation of the word he come to preach the truth of the word the revelation of the word God inspired him to do so yes but that doesn't make him any better than you or I because he does the exact same thing for us he was a different position he was a prophet of God to be able to receive that so he could bring it to us but God reveals it to us in the same way yes he has to because it's God he got to do the same thing the same way as he has always done he is God as God as god notice not not God but as God Seth in the temple of God his own church we just read brother Ram said in his own church showing himself that he is God he has become the object of worship how has Satan become the object of worship because they've neglected and denied Jesus Christ right they stand and sing it they stand and preach it but they deny the word they deny Christ and by denying any one word of the word is denying Christ yes amen amen any one word denies Christ that's how they deny Christ oh we're Christians we believe we have church we have uh songs we have preaching we preach out of the Bible but do you preach the pure unadulterated word out of the Bible or some man's idea or your own interpretation did you get your sermon off of YouTube did you find it off of some place that gave you a nice amen I'm here to tell you this morning Saints your P I have never done that I never planned to do that either I've gotten a thought here and there when I've gone to a church or something like brother Rogers the other day I might get a thought or something from somebody they said but go to try to find a Ser I've actually gone to a Christian bookstore and you can you can actually buy a book of recommended sermons you can actually read them word for word write out of the book if you want to that's where is God yes where who wrote this down by what Authority does this person have to put this in a book for you to read to your congregation so that that congregation is going to be fed by the pure word of God what gives that person that Authority I I just I I just like to know but you you see it's the same enemy amen it's the same enemy and so many times he uses the education thing he tries to make it so revelated that's that's the word that's use so revelated uh try to make it so hard to understand for the common person that that all they can do is just well that must be true because I couldn't understand it yeah amen well that's the world that's exactly what the world feeds you you know that the the the science politics medicine they they always try to feed the the the common public with things that they can't understand mik is talking about the Medicare thing we went to lunch last Sunday and I heard somebody behind us talking about something as simple as Medicare should be so simple that a 90-year-old should be able to understand to be able to make the right choices and do the right thing but the government has made it so complicated oh people like well it it must be right cuz I can't understand it that's what the world does that's what that's what government does that's what a lot of times medicine stuff they want to complicate things so much and that same spirit is in the church yes to try to make things so highly and revelated and so complicated and so that people I spent an hour and a half one time riding home from uh some uh meetings back in North Carolina with my pastor and another brother and this brother I don't even think he took a breath for an hour and a half he talked so much and everything he said we got to the end and he was trying to ask me things I say brother I don't have a clue what you said I have no idea pulling stuff from this message and this message and making things so I said who I Hope You Don't Preach this to to the common people cuz I can't understand it and I'm a minister and I know the message I've listened to Feast of the trumpets 100 well not a 100 but many times what are you talking about and and and you get right down to the bottom line of it and you try to tie them with the scripture they don't a lot of times even know what they're saying yes they just take these pet quoes and stuff and they try to throw them all together to try to make something sound like something that's not yeah but it confuses people so much this well that's it must be right cuz he's a smart guy and I'm might I can understand it but he's a smart guy it's got to be right no it doesn't we've went through the Simplicity part of that already amen no it does not have to be right but God a Satan showing himself as God in his own church with people worshiping him hands raised tears falling amen mascara running he's doing the exact same thing they're worshiping a devil and they don't even know it through the word through the sword that was given to him let's continue Satan's Eden god of the world Satan is God of this Earth remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now ye know what withholdeth or what hindereth what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time and we just went through that with uh with talking about Daniel Revelation 10 that it was held back so that it would be revealed in that time in God's time it says his time uh which is that time of the devil God is the one who's orchestrating the whole thing amen amen so it's being held back till it's revealed in its proper time till its right time says his time for the mystery of iniquity and that is lawlessness amen lawlessness uh iniquity is doing something you know you shouldn't or not doing something you know you should which is basically lawlessness the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now leth will let or or uh would you say he who restrains will hold back will let he will be taken out of the way praise God look now and then shall that Wicked be revealed and it is whom the Lord shall consume the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth we've already read the scripture to identify what that is amen consuming him destroying him with the word yes praise God because that's the one thing brother said he could not do he said he he can impersonate any kind of a gift speaking tongues Prophet all these he can impersonate any of those gifts but he cannot he cannot bring that word word by word by word amen so he cannot bring that word word by word so what is it it's that it's the it's the death strike of the sword that kills him consumed with the spirit of his mouth and he shall destroy with the brightness of his coming praise the Lord I just denote that as as the mechanics and Dynamics amen brightness the word is the sword the brightness of his mouth the brightness is the spirit amen praise the Lord even him let me finish through this even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all dece deceivableness of unrighteousness in them in who in them that perish not in the bride not not in The Believer but in that in in them that perish because they who they the ones that perish receive not the love of the truth they've received a a a a knowledge of a truth they've received a word they've said in church they've gone to Seminary but to receive the love of the truth is two different things remember that love that something comes from what do we say I love you with all my heart if you go back to Isaiah 14 and talking about Satan again what is the first thing the first thing it points out without reading it you can go back and read it the first thing is point out that says in your heart or in his heart in Satan's heart it was in his heart amen something that was determined not an idea not a thought but in his heart he was going to become like God exalted above the Stars be worshiped like God in his heart now look they say that this received not the love of the truth where in their heart right it's not in them it might be on them it might be something in their flesh or Spirit but there's no love there there's no when there's no love there's no Revelation there's no Revelation no desire for the true word for the pure word of God it's simply a letter it's simply a word amen it's not a truth it's not a revelation they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God God you see again you wonder how where does this come from who gives this Authority God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie praise the Lord now I I'm someone that I I you know I don't I don't I'm not working to change the word but to look at the word a little closer and to recognizing the characteristics of God that God would not purposely cause a stumbling block but God does allow things to happen so that that person would stumble God would allow that but it's Satan that's working it so when it says God send them strong delusion that's it's just like uh when they went down to Micah uh God was looking around seeing who is going to deceive Ahab in the going up there and getting killed to fulfill Elijah's prophecy and a and a lying Spirit came up and said I'll do it I'll put a lying spirit in the mouth of every one of his prophets and it'll convince him that he needs to do this God says you'll do it go ahead God didn't do it but he allowed it amen you say that lying Spirit was sent forth from God it was in the presence of God but the person that that Spirit did it Satan is doing it God sending them strong delusion what is that that's test are we going to believe or are we not going to believe God will hit our lives friends with unbelievable sometimes what we might think unbearable tests things that we don't know or believe that we could go through again it's like brother random when he lost his wife and his baby how did you keep your religion I didn't he kept me and to understand that those tests they're hard they're at and they're very personal sometimes they hit home but God's the one in charge Sint amen because he's weeding out and and and taking away the unbeliever the make believer if you will the one that has come and rubbed right up against but not a part of it's like the five wise and the five foolish amen but there's even those that that come that look just just like the genuine that they're not even foolish virgin they're not even a part of the kingdom of God at all period That's I say that with very sincere sadness amen right but it's a scripture and it's trueth yes am I just thank God I'm not I'm not one of those amen but from my heart to believe this word it's a truth this message this message people say what they want is truth amen and for this cause God sent them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned or judged who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness amen they they would rather have prefer having something of unrighteousness something of the flesh rather than brother Dennis quoted in in his prayer today and Timothy amen he High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false break truce Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of others that are good amen reject the word don't want to have anything to do with God although they come up and look like they are a part of uh a move of God a Christian belief or some do denomination or group of some kind but they have no desire in their heart for God there's nothing there it's Satan that's orchestrating this whole thing being contrary is being something that is being contrar is being something that's other than what God has already brought amen and unfortunately a lot of people bring something other than what has been brought in the disguise of something that's been brought they'll make it sound like something that has been said or something that's in the message when it really isn't or taking a quote here or a quote there or a scripture here a scripture there and try to make something out of something that's not that's not in the continuity of the scripture or in the continuity of the spirit of the message even the spirit of the man amen um let me read this I'll close seed of discrepancy uh Phoenix 1965 when a man stands and says he is a gospel preacher and says that the days of Miracles is passed that is the seat of discrepancy when a man stands and says that he's a Minister a pastor of a church of somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today and forever that's the seat of discrepancy when he says that miracles in Apostolic age pass that's the seed of discrepancy when they say there is no such a thing as Divine Healing that's the seed of discrepancy and the word is full of it it crowds out and chokes out the wheat we notice that the first so of the seed of discrepancy was branded the devil the first s the first Ser of the seed of discrepancy was branded the devil who was it branded that by God and we know it was Genesis 1 and we find out here in the Book of Matthew 13th chapter Jesus still Brands listen to this now Jesus still Brands any discrepancy to his word as being the devil amen any discrepancy to God's word as being the devil this 1956 and those who want to follow that every word brother Bram spoke was divine I'll challenge you with this one right here brother Bram says and in this 1956 it's 1965 was brother brandom teleported it all of a sudden back to 506 no he's a man I made a mistake amen that simple amen it's not difficult to understand it's difficult to understand when you make a man God yeah you can't reconcile that but when you understand he was a man that God was using then you could understand that man can make a mistake I make mistakes up here all the time say things that uh confuse one word of the other or one person in the Bible of the or something I've done that since I started preaching I guess I don't know that me as a human that'll ever stop but brother Brandon said this 1956 it was 1965 not 1956 anything and I'll close with this anything that SWS discrepancy contrary to the written word of God or or puts any private interpretation to it it is the seed of discrepancy any private interpretation makes it the seat of discrepancy God will not honor it he can't because it won't mix with the pure word of God it certainly will not it's like the Mustard Seed it won't mix it can't because it's discrepancy it is uh it is uh something other than the true pure word of God and it's got to be the pure word to be correct now we know that this man of sin has been revealed we know that that sin is unbelief and that orchestration of what the devil is doing is to get as many people to disbelieve the pure unadulterated word as he possibly can and if he's got to work through people churches ministers he'll do so and he does do so and it'll be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible but thank God it is not possible for the elect to be deceived amen praise the Lord let's stand a few as I said next week it it will get a lot more personal it'll get a lot more down home amen because we can understand and see friends it's not the things out in the world today it's not the Baptist it's not the Methodist it's not the Catholic it it's not even the the charismatic churches amen it's right here amongst us amen right here amongst us yes and it behooves us to be very careful yes but God look I don't know if you've ever been in a situation like that as many people as I know as many places as I've been as many churches as I've preached in I've seen it uh I've watched it happen I've seen certain things like that unfold and manifest themselves to their detriment and and my displeasure happen I've seen certain things like that unfold and manifest themselves to their detriment and and my displeasure but it happens and it's true yes but it's the word yes can't deny the word amen unfortunately it does happen it's happened to people I know yes people that have been very close to me people I considered good friends amen but God knows but God always the thing that I solace in is that God always has for me has brought something about like a revelation and begins to warn me that something's going on I don't know about you I don't know if you've ever been in those situations I have and it's something that God brings around and I just one particular brother I'm thinking I'm like I have a conversation with him like there's something not right about that something in my spirit something in me just just didn't identify with what he was was talking about right and it goes on next conversation or something or something's eating at me it just it just it just devolves but but God is there to witness to you yes amen for those who are the believer God is there to witness to
