[37:08] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[37:12] Genesis chapter 2 1 verse the last verse
[37:15] 25 uh Genesis 2:25 and they were both
[37:18] naked the man and his wife and we're not
[37:22] ashamed now let's go over to
[37:24] 37 37 which is probably on the the same
[37:27] page is on M yes and the eyes of them
[37:31] both were open and they knew that they
[37:34] were naked and they sewed fig leaves
[37:36] Together made themselves aprons you can
[37:39] be seated if you'd
[37:41] like something tremendously dramatic
[37:45] happened in just a couple of verses of
[37:48] scripture something
[37:51] tremendously in one
[37:53] minute uh they are naked and and they
[37:58] don't know it or they're naked and not
[38:00] ashamed it doesn't say they didn't know
[38:03] it it just says that they weren't
[38:05] ashamed right amen so uh so obviously
[38:09] they were living in a condition a
[38:11] spiritual condition that their nakedness
[38:13] didn't bother them it was nothing that
[38:15] meant uh anything to them because there
[38:19] was no reason to because at the time
[38:22] they were living in in a state of
[38:24] Holiness they were living in a in a in a
[38:27] place of uh that was holy they were
[38:29] living in a holy condition they were
[38:32] created by God Almighty so everything
[38:35] about it was holy and righteous and good
[38:39] so there was no reason for there to be
[38:41] any kind of uh a shame amen no shame
[38:46] even though they were in that condition
[38:48] but something happened obviously between
[38:50] that verse and just a few verses later
[38:54] where their eyes became open amen amen
[38:58] amen they realized that they were naked
[39:01] and then they were
[39:03] ashamed so between the 25th between 2:25
[39:07] and 37 their eyes came open now what
[39:10] eyes because they could already see
[39:13] obviously they weren't blind people they
[39:16] they actually had natural vision so
[39:19] obviously a different eye came open and
[39:23] they realized something that they did
[39:25] not realize before or they recognized
[39:28] this they they knew that they were in
[39:31] this condition but before they knew if
[39:34] they knew they were in this condition
[39:35] doesn't say they didn't know in this
[39:38] condition they were not ashamed now
[39:40] knowing they're in this condition
[39:42] because their eyes are open they're
[39:44] they're ashamed they're ashamed of their
[39:48] nakedness now where did the shame come
[39:50] from because there is no shame in God
[39:53] right there's no shame in Holiness
[39:55] there's no reason to be ashamed when you
[39:57] serve God and live for God and if
[40:00] there's any shame to the the things that
[40:02] we do and how we live because we do what
[40:04] we do based on the scripture and to
[40:06] glorify God if there's any shame in that
[40:09] then it's not godly right you say well I
[40:12] do exactly what the Bible says I I
[40:14] follow the scripture I've done exactly
[40:16] what brother brandom said and I I I've
[40:18] lived this way and I've done this and
[40:20] I've dedicated this but if you're living
[40:22] in a state of Shame that's not godliness
[40:24] amen you're you're living in in in a uh
[40:28] a self uh uh self-righteous state right
[40:33] you you're living in a state of
[40:34] self-righteous you're you're not living
[40:36] in the righteousness of God you're
[40:37] living in your own righteousness you
[40:39] you're living in a place of of trying to
[40:42] make yourself something that you're not
[40:44] if you're ashamed to do the things that
[40:47] uh and and obviously i' I've known
[40:49] people in that condition they won't
[40:52] admit it at the time they don't say it
[40:55] but they are and they are because you
[40:57] one reason you get to know them in such
[41:00] a way or another reason is those people
[41:02] have left and turned back from the way
[41:04] they used to live right so if they're
[41:06] not living the way they used to live and
[41:08] their life was dedicated to God somehow
[41:11] there was there had to be some shame in
[41:13] the way they were living or they would
[41:14] still be living that way right amen amen
[41:17] now there's shame where did shame come
[41:20] from shame could not have been from God
[41:22] because there's no shame in God again
[41:25] the shame had to come from the enemy
[41:28] shame had to come from uh the devil
[41:31] shame had to come from sin the the the
[41:34] sin is what created the shame right the
[41:37] fall of nature is what created the shame
[41:40] amen not not God uh but the condition
[41:44] when their eyes were open let's read
[41:48] we've read this part of the scripture
[41:49] many many times but I want to read it
[41:51] over again we'll start back at the 25th
[41:54] uh
[41:55] 225 and read through to
[41:58] 37 they were both naked the man and his
[42:02] wife and were not ashamed amen so we can
[42:07] only assume because it does not say that
[42:10] I have ever found whether they knew that
[42:13] they were naked at that point or not so
[42:14] we assume they did know it doesn't say
[42:17] that they did not know amen they knew
[42:20] but there was no shame so look so they
[42:23] must have been looking through a
[42:25] different
[42:25] lens uh by the way my title today is
[42:28] going to be going Beyond the Veil uh may
[42:32] actually probably be two or three parts
[42:34] because uh there's a multifaceted part
[42:36] of the veil amen uh that we but this
[42:41] this is where I wanted to start this
[42:42] Veil so there must have been a different
[42:45] lens that they were looking through
[42:46] because they weren't blind amen they
[42:49] could see with their eyes so what did it
[42:51] mean when their eyes were open it had to
[42:55] be something different than their
[42:57] natural eye amen because they could see
[43:01] so they could see obviously they could
[43:04] see one another unclothed they could see
[43:07] one another naked but it didn't mean
[43:09] anything to them there was no shame
[43:11] because they were looking through a
[43:12] different
[43:13] lens they were looking through a holy
[43:16] lens they were looking through a holy
[43:18] Veil God had them veiled even though
[43:21] they were naked God had them veiled not
[43:24] on their bodies but their eyes right the
[43:27] veil was on the eye not on the body amen
[43:31] a a woman when she gets married she'll
[43:33] wear a veil over her face amen and it
[43:37] should be I don't know how often this
[43:40] happens anymore but it should be that
[43:43] when the man lifts that woman's Veil
[43:45] that's the first time he's ever kissed
[43:47] her right amen that's way it's supposed
[43:51] to be um I me nor me or my wife were
[43:55] living for the Lord so we did KISS
[43:57] before we got married but it's supposed
[43:59] to be and again how many times this
[44:02] happens I don't know that that's the
[44:04] first time the veil is lifted amen when
[44:09] the veil gets lifted there's an
[44:12] exposure and that opens up the Avenue
[44:15] now what is it it opens up the
[44:17] expression of the man and the woman now
[44:20] being one
[44:22] flesh gives him by God permission to be
[44:25] able to engage in an activity that they
[44:28] could not should not have engaged in
[44:30] Prior legally scripturally amen so that
[44:35] Veil when that veil was lifted it
[44:37] created something amen when this veil
[44:40] was there it wasn't over their bodies
[44:42] but it was over their eyes God had a
[44:45] holy Veil over their eyes so what they
[44:48] saw was to a different
[44:51] lens amen oh H how uh how I would love
[44:57] uh to be looking through that lens today
[45:00] how about you Amen brother brandom would
[45:03] not had to put a cross in his car if
[45:06] that if if we were looking through that
[45:08] lens amen amen but since the fall amen
[45:12] it created a a different lens amen a
[45:16] different Veil if you will it wasn't a
[45:19] holy Veil anymore when they fail it was
[45:22] a lust Veil it was a demonic lust Veil
[45:26] that then came over their eyes and then
[45:28] when they looked it was not just a look
[45:31] to say oh you're naked it was a lustful
[45:36] condition that was created by the
[45:38] lifting of that Veil right amen now
[45:42] let's let's move on they were both naked
[45:45] the man his wife and were not
[45:49] ashamed um kind of glad the kids aren't
[45:52] in this for this part but uh we'll move
[45:55] on from this now the serpent was more
[45:58] subtle than any beast of the field which
[46:01] the Lord God had made and we know as
[46:03] we've said many times that means uh
[46:05] cunning crafty uh uh deceiving beguiling
[46:10] it also means sensible uh as as we've
[46:14] said several times we understand when
[46:17] you look up
[46:18] subtle in the Hebrew uh a context of
[46:22] that is sensible what he gave to Eve
[46:26] made sense Amen to her when he offered
[46:30] it to her it made sense to
[46:33] her as it was it was as sensible as it
[46:36] was beguiling as it was
[46:38] deceiving amen then any beast of the
[46:41] field which the Lord God had made he
[46:43] said unto the woman yay hath God said ye
[46:47] shall not eat of every tree of the
[46:49] garden and again as you said he's
[46:51] questioning the woman said unto the
[46:53] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[46:56] Trees of the Garden but of the fruit of
[46:59] the tree which is in the midst of the
[47:01] garden no explanation needed with
[47:05] amongst us adults to understand midst
[47:08] middle of the garden God has said ye
[47:11] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[47:14] touch it lest she die okay now we've got
[47:18] another situation
[47:20] arose when God said ye shall
[47:24] die he did not mean that they would
[47:26] physically die right there right he
[47:29] meant that there would be a separation
[47:32] now you look at a lot of people uh look
[47:35] and they play with the words uh but you
[47:38] you can take the word die and you can
[47:40] make it several
[47:43] meanings um uh you can mean physically
[47:47] death uh a person could say oh uh my
[47:51] boyfriend broke up with me and I just
[47:53] died
[47:55] inside well they were still living I was
[47:58] in such love with him that I died inside
[48:02] when he left me amen what does that mean
[48:06] well it means something to that person
[48:08] because they're the ones who gave it
[48:10] their their death not physical still
[48:13] breathing still alive meant something to
[48:16] her on the inside right amen praise the
[48:21] Lord I died I I remember oh this may
[48:24] sound awful carnal I'm very sorry for
[48:26] this but when I was in high school there
[48:28] was a song that came out and a lyric of
[48:31] that song cuz when I was in high school
[48:32] I listen to that music uh that a song
[48:35] came out and one of the the lyrics of
[48:38] that song you see how powerful music is
[48:41] I mean from uh 40 what was it 41 years
[48:46] now I've been graduated anyway uh over
[48:49] 40 years but a but a lyric of that song
[48:53] said I died in your arms tonight
[48:57] now that doesn't mean that that man that
[49:00] person literally physically lost his
[49:02] breath in that woman's
[49:05] arms that's not what it means right amen
[49:08] but you understand the different uh
[49:11] application of that same word right oh I
[49:14] just died inside oh he he died yesterday
[49:18] um uh you could even say I died my hair
[49:21] but that's actually uh spelled a
[49:23] different way but you understand what
[49:24] I'm saying when God said when you eat of
[49:27] that fruit ye shall touch it neither
[49:30] shall you eat it or touch it lest you
[49:32] die
[49:34] amen now this is what the the serpent
[49:38] came back to her
[49:40] with and the serpent said unto the woman
[49:42] ye shall not surely die now they're
[49:46] talking about two different
[49:50] things but he's he's deceived her to the
[49:53] point that she doesn't realize that
[49:57] amen amen he's deceived her to the point
[50:01] see he that Veil is still there but he's
[50:06] questioning the Integrity of not only
[50:09] Adam but of what God literally
[50:13] said amen the day you eat the day you
[50:16] touch that day you're going to die and
[50:19] he comes back and says you shall not
[50:21] surely die God and what she's
[50:23] replicating said that you're going to
[50:26] die what a separation from God right
[50:30] amen amen a separation that and that's
[50:33] what we know as brother ROMs taught us
[50:35] that that death that spiritual if you
[50:38] will death is a separation from God if
[50:41] you are separated from God my friend you
[50:43] are dead yes period I don't care how
[50:47] alive you are I don't how good a shape
[50:49] you're in I don't care how much breath
[50:51] you draw how great a pulse you have if
[50:54] you are separated from God you are dead
[50:57] dead spiritually dead now he comes along
[51:02] and says you will not surely die what's
[51:04] he telling her he's telling her you are
[51:07] not going to physically
[51:09] die but what is Sheil see so they're
[51:11] talking in two different ways of the
[51:13] word die but he's got her so with that
[51:17] Veil so convinced so beguiled so
[51:20] deceived now that she doesn't recognize
[51:24] what he said the the difference
[51:27] the kindness of the
[51:29] enemy knows exactly what he's talking
[51:32] about where to go how to do again he
[51:36] knows the weakest spots that we have
[51:39] where to hit he's got that Punch Coming
[51:43] amen we know that but she doesn't
[51:49] recognize and and we can get into the
[51:52] the byproduct and from Adam and uh woman
[51:56] all
[51:57] if you want I'm just going to skip over
[51:59] that I don't think that needs to be uh
[52:03] uh iterated here today but recognizing
[52:06] who the Serpent's working with he didn't
[52:10] go to
[52:12] Adam amen serpent didn't go to Adam he
[52:15] knew
[52:17] better he went to Eve right because he
[52:20] knew he could get in that feminist
[52:23] spirit in
[52:25] that condition I condition as woman he
[52:28] knew he could make inroads with her
[52:31] because she was not of the original
[52:32] creation she is a byproduct right she
[52:34] was from man one man and being that
[52:38] byproduct he knew that he could get in
[52:41] to deceive her in a way he could not get
[52:44] to Adam in fact the scripture even says
[52:47] after the fall in first Timothy after
[52:49] all that that that the Bible itself says
[52:52] that Adam was not deceived even in the
[52:55] fall right even when he went in and
[52:58] partook of it from her with her the
[53:02] Bible says he was not deceived right so
[53:05] if he wasn't deceived then you
[53:07] understand that makes that makes it
[53:10] really clear why the serpent did not go
[53:13] to Adam he went to Eve because he found
[53:16] a vessel he could work in brother bandam
[53:19] said she wandered away from the word
[53:23] Adam which was the word to her she
[53:26] wandered way and the serpent found her
[53:29] alone that's how he was able to talk to
[53:31] her and convince her and beguile her
[53:34] this way it's because he found her alone
[53:37] right and again the worst condition that
[53:41] anybody could be in Saints is away from
[53:43] God yes when you're alone away from the
[53:46] word when you separated yourself from
[53:48] the truth of God's word the Holy Spirit
[53:51] and reading and praying when you've
[53:53] separated yourself and a and you're away
[53:55] from God your defenses are let down and
[53:58] you're wide open for anything that the
[54:00] devil would bring to you male or female
[54:04] amen because remember this is after the
[54:06] fall now then you're open to anything
[54:09] anything that could be something that uh
[54:12] uh even a a hybridation of God's word
[54:15] from another Minister yes or just flat
[54:17] out demonic lies yes whatever it might
[54:21] be if you're away from God if your
[54:23] life's not fortified with God when you
[54:26] get away from the word you're fair game
[54:28] for the devil yes and she was fair game
[54:31] for the devil and the devil was able the
[54:33] serpent the devil the serpent the devil
[54:36] through the serpent was able to beguile
[54:38] her to the point that he's talking to
[54:41] her in a way that she doesn't recognize
[54:43] he she
[54:45] believes what he's
[54:48] saying because of the veil that he's
[54:52] presented to her amen again a veil of
[54:55] Flesh
[54:57] but now look the serpent said unto the
[55:00] woman ye shall not surely
[55:04] die God is telling her and talking
[55:08] spiritual amen because everything was
[55:11] spiritual then there there was not a
[55:16] necessity if you will of even
[55:18] considering to think about or worry
[55:20] about the flesh right God took care of
[55:23] everything he created Adam and and all
[55:26] the botney life and the and the uh
[55:29] animal life and God made the sun he made
[55:33] the moon he made the waters he made God
[55:35] took care of everything right amen so
[55:38] there was there was not a need of all
[55:40] these things it was a place of a Utopia
[55:43] it was a place of perfection it was a
[55:45] place of Holiness all the things that we
[55:48] think about worry about most all the
[55:50] things that that come to our minds
[55:51] during the day time was at did didn't
[55:54] mean anything to them it never came came
[55:56] to his mind wasn't
[55:59] necessary one day it won't be necessary
[56:02] again but it wasn't
[56:04] necessary because sin had not entered in
[56:08] amen the blip of time had not entered in
[56:10] they were living in a place of
[56:12] perfection eternity amen but now when
[56:16] when she heard this you shall not surely
[56:19] die he's talking about well you're not
[56:21] going to lose your breath you're not
[56:24] going to fall on the ground and die die
[56:26] is and no longer be
[56:29] alive but look what she look how he's
[56:32] convinced her now for God does
[56:34] know that in the day ye eat thereof now
[56:38] it sounds like the exact same thing
[56:40] isn't this that it's the same old devil
[56:43] you know the devil is just as quick and
[56:45] just as happy to deceive you with the
[56:48] word as he is anything else right the
[56:52] devil would just assume and actually I
[56:55] don't know that he would wouldn't prefer
[56:57] deceiving you with the word than to see
[56:59] you in a bar down here somewhere smoking
[57:02] a cigarette and drinking Li
[57:04] liquor that's true I I believe that
[57:07] anyway amen amen I believe the devil
[57:10] would just as soon get you off the word
[57:13] then have you down there
[57:16] amen that's the truth oh God yeah that's
[57:19] right the deception of the word it's
[57:21] always been his practice look how he
[57:24] look how he went to Jesus
[57:27] look how he came to Jesus in Matthew
[57:29] what did he do he used the
[57:33] word he tried to deceive the word with
[57:36] the word exact same thing he did to Eve
[57:38] here now if he had come to Adam with
[57:41] that same stuff Adam would have did the
[57:44] same thing Jesus did right but she was
[57:47] in a position to be deceived and notice
[57:50] he's trying to use the word against her
[57:54] right all isn't that the truth
[57:58] today we talk about the the the the
[58:01] lifting up and this you talk about a
[58:04] Rejuvenation you know back years ago
[58:07] when we've always known because because
[58:10] the prophet told us and we can see it in
[58:12] the scripture uh how this was going to
[58:15] unfold and who was going to be behind it
[58:18] all and who was in charge of it we know
[58:21] who the Beast is we know what the Beast
[58:24] is going to be writing
[58:26] amen so if we know that a few several
[58:29] years ago we're like wow that that that
[58:31] whole organization is just flattened out
[58:34] and the the U ridicule and the the U
[58:40] Scandal they had of the molestation of
[58:43] these boys and stuff and all that thing
[58:45] happened and I remember walking in when
[58:48] we right after we first moved to
[58:50] Tucson and uh my barber who just retired
[58:53] my old Barber he was in there and he was
[58:55] working with in his brother's shop and
[58:59] uh we walked in to an appointment he was
[59:02] going to cut my hair and they had their
[59:04] mother sitting in one of the barber
[59:05] chairs him and his brother and they were
[59:07] pleading with her and they were talking
[59:09] to her and she was crying and and I
[59:11] talked to him L said what are what what
[59:13] is the problem and she was so distraught
[59:16] about the Catholic church because
[59:17] they're real heavy Catholics she was so
[59:19] distraught over the Catholic church and
[59:21] all that had been going on in the church
[59:23] and all the proven at that time had come
[59:26] out hundreds if not thousands of
[59:29] molestation charges and all that that
[59:31] came forth and it just tore her apart it
[59:34] broke her heart and they were trying to
[59:36] sit there and reason with her and talk
[59:37] to her and calm her down and I tell you
[59:40] what friend she wasn't having any of it
[59:42] now she stayed as far as I know
[59:45] according to my barber she stayed a
[59:46] Catholic till she died that's not
[59:49] whatever uh but I just remember that
[59:52] time amen and you think back there and
[59:55] and think my how is
[59:57] this this is this Pope is supposed to be
[1:00:00] is the Beast and this church is supposed
[1:00:03] to be the most powerful richest uh
[1:00:06] entity on the earth that he's riding on
[1:00:09] the most powerful most influential and
[1:00:11] you look today and you look around and
[1:00:13] you see uh the prayer apps is coming out
[1:00:18] amen you ever heard you ever seen that
[1:00:20] prayer they have an app now that's a
[1:00:21] Prayer app uh I don't know much about it
[1:00:25] don't have it on my phone
[1:00:26] uh but I do know that the prayers end
[1:00:28] with father son the Holy
[1:00:30] Ghost amen they don't they don't they
[1:00:34] don't say in Jesus Christ's name that
[1:00:37] that that all in and it's what is it
[1:00:39] it's a it's a Catholic driven thing
[1:00:42] right uh you see like I said this new
[1:00:46] series or movie or whatever it is has
[1:00:47] come out about Saints and it's supposed
[1:00:50] to be this great popular thing it's this
[1:00:54] whole movement friend I want you seed
[1:00:56] the seed of Satan this whole thing is
[1:00:59] has regenerated a movement and is and is
[1:01:03] sweeping across the world not just the
[1:01:05] country but sweeping across the world
[1:01:08] today and taking over people again to
[1:01:11] where people are falling right be right
[1:01:13] back into that same machine that a lot
[1:01:16] of people probably came out of or quit
[1:01:19] right it's the same thing amen it's one
[1:01:22] of those veils we'll talk about it's one
[1:01:25] of those veils and people are coming
[1:01:27] right back to it again it's the same
[1:01:29] thing it's the same deception right
[1:01:32] exact same thing Satan's doing right
[1:01:34] here through the serpent to eeve exact
[1:01:36] same thing God doth
[1:01:39] know how dare you preach the word of God
[1:01:42] to me you
[1:01:44] devil amen I mean saying sometimes we
[1:01:47] just need to get a little bold with it
[1:01:49] to understand this is just a product of
[1:01:51] the devil amen how dare you speak to me
[1:01:55] you devil how dare you try to preach or
[1:01:58] give me the word you
[1:02:01] devil amen there's nothing but deception
[1:02:05] and lies in there I don't care how much
[1:02:07] of it is true you know if this from hell

[1:03:01] the tree was good for food amen she
[1:03:04] enjoyed it quite lustful then there was
[1:03:07] pleasant to the eye a tree to be desired

[1:08:05] as uh as I I think about moving this
[1:08:09] forward we receive that Holy Veil again
[1:08:14] amen I I know we're humans I I know that
[1:08:18] lust Veil still there in this flesh but
[1:08:21] I'm not talking about the flesh anymore
[1:08:24] uh the the day you eat thereof is the
[1:08:26] day you die that's what God Said serpent
[1:08:30] said You shall not die but the serpent
[1:08:33] was talking about a physical
[1:08:36] death God was talking about a spiritual
[1:08:39] death right but to the bride there is no
[1:08:42] such thing as a spiritual death right
[1:08:46] there's no such thing as a spiritual
[1:08:47] death doesn't exist to her praise God
[1:08:51] that's why the Bible John says he that
[1:08:54] is of god God cannot sin he that is born
[1:08:57] of God cannot sin amen praise the
[1:09:01] Lord man if you if you took this to a
[1:09:04] Baptist Church friend these people be
[1:09:05] walking out on
[1:09:08] you oh my but there's got to be the holy
[1:09:12] Veil over the bride yes amen because
[1:09:16] she's veiled herself God has veiled her
[1:09:19] amen for the rest of the world we got to
[1:09:20] look be we we have to look beyond that
[1:09:24] human Veil yes we've got to go beyond
[1:09:27] that flesh Veil we've got to go past
[1:09:30] that that lust Veil amen for that to to
[1:09:35] be clothed in that Holy Veil yes amen of
[1:09:38] the righteousness of Jesus Christ praise
[1:09:41] the lord we got to go beyond that people
[1:09:44] today even in the Garden of Eden they
[1:09:46] tried to put on a
[1:09:48] veil amen notice seventh verse again
[1:09:52] their eyes were open
[1:09:55] amen praise the Lord and I will say as
[1:09:59] I've said many times as brother random
[1:10:01] said as I've heard other ministers say
[1:10:04] if it took an apple to open their eyes
[1:10:06] to their nakedness list pass the apples
[1:10:09] again amen it took apricot if it took an
[1:10:12] orange if it took a tangelo I don't care
[1:10:15] a lemon whatever it took a pomegranate
[1:10:18] whatever it took whatever it was that
[1:10:20] fruit that they claimed that they picked
[1:10:23] off a tree or a bush if that is what
[1:10:26] caused them to see their nakedness it's
[1:10:28] time to pull them again yes it's time to
[1:10:31] pass them around by the
[1:10:33] millions
[1:10:34] billions amen it's time to pass them
[1:10:37] around again amen but the Bible says
[1:10:39] that this day that we live they would be
[1:10:42] poor miserable blind wretched
[1:10:45] naked and not know it why because of the
[1:10:49] lust Veil amen the lust Veil now they've
[1:10:54] got a veil over them that they look and
[1:10:57] are not ashamed
[1:10:58] anymore they're not ashamed anymore they
[1:11:01] walk around today and it means nothing
[1:11:03] to them
[1:11:04] now amen no more shame right praise the
[1:11:08] Lord why because I it it's like it's
[1:11:12] like brother bandam said a sinner can't
[1:11:14] sin you think how that doesn't make any
[1:11:16] sense at
[1:11:17] all he can't sin because that's who he
[1:11:21] is
[1:11:23] amen he can't sin because he's a uh
[1:11:26] because he's a sinner that's just who he
[1:11:28] is right amen he's just being who he is
[1:11:31] praise the lord well it's the same thing
[1:11:34] they're just being who they are praise
[1:11:37] the Lord so there's no shame here there
[1:11:40] was some godliness now there is
[1:11:44] none that I imagine I I I don't know
[1:11:49] don't go to them haven't seen it but I
[1:11:52] imagine that they probably will walk
[1:11:54] into the churches around the world today
[1:11:57] dressed like that
[1:11:59] right SK clothed so tight look like a
[1:12:03] skin down
[1:12:04] wiener showing every lump bump hump
[1:12:07] everywhere you can
[1:12:08] find well what godliness what Holiness
[1:12:12] is there to that
[1:12:14] right my talk about imagination it's a
[1:12:18] lust Veil amen the creator of that is
[1:12:21] the devil and he did it to deceive the
[1:12:24] men's the the sons of God to throw them
[1:12:28] off to bring that lust Veil into Play
[1:12:31] Amen so that it thrust them into hell
[1:12:34] too the whole point of it that's why
[1:12:37] brother BR said that was that's the
[1:12:39] Satan's the one that designed it he
[1:12:41] designed it that way amen amen praise
[1:12:44] the Lord but now they tried to put a
[1:12:48] veil their eyes were open they knew they
[1:12:51] were naked and they sewed fig leaves
[1:12:54] together and made themselves
[1:12:57] aprons they tried to Veil themselves
[1:13:00] again where not the eyes now the holy
[1:13:03] veil's been lifted the holy veil was
[1:13:06] lifted when they
[1:13:07] sinned and sin entered into the camp and
[1:13:11] when the Holy veil was lifted all they
[1:13:13] could see was The
[1:13:16] Shame of the naked so they tried to sew
[1:13:19] fig leaves together now this is before
[1:13:22] God comes down notice this is is before
[1:13:25] they tried sewing fig leaves together
[1:13:27] even before God tried to come down in
[1:13:29] the cool of the day to fellowship with
[1:13:31] him again like he had done every single
[1:13:33] day they tried doing that even before
[1:13:36] God when God came down and begin to
[1:13:39] speak looking for Adam that's when they
[1:13:42] hid in the trees in the bushes amen amen
[1:13:46] another Veil that they tried to use amen
[1:13:50] they tried to Veil themselves with these
[1:13:52] fig leaves man-made
[1:13:55] ecclesiastical figes hoping thinking
[1:13:59] that would hide their nakedness so that
[1:14:01] they would be
[1:14:02] okay now Adam knew that it wouldn't but
[1:14:05] what else Choice did he have right amen
[1:14:10] amen look so many veils they still and
[1:14:14] people still try to do the same thing
[1:14:16] today people still try to Veil
[1:14:19] themselves to make themselves feel okay
[1:14:22] and look okay and think
[1:14:26] worry about it once a year maybe not at
[1:14:28] all maybe go to church once a year I
[1:14:31] know my wife used to tell me that or she
[1:14:33] has said many times before that her
[1:14:35] family when she was growing up they were
[1:14:36] really good solid Easter and Christmas
[1:14:40] Christians if any other time they they
[1:14:43] were in church on Easter and they were
[1:14:44] in church on Christmas amen there were
[1:14:47] good solid Easter Christmas Christians
[1:14:49] that's what they were I'm assuming
[1:14:52] hopefully uh because I didn't see it
[1:14:54] happen they didn't self-combust when we
[1:14:56] got married into church and they had to
[1:14:58] come on a day that wasn't Easter
[1:14:59] Christmas but they were still alive when
[1:15:02] we left but there's so many of these
[1:15:06] people that are like that right that
[1:15:08] they are that that is their Veil their
[1:15:12] religion and I don't mean to say

[1:18:58] in that late of a day that late that
[1:19:00] long ago things weren't recorded
[1:19:03] sometimes a lot of times people knew
[1:19:05] what they knew because they talked to
[1:19:07] each other right amen wow did you you
[1:19:11] were you there when that bridge fell I
[1:19:13] saw those men come and fell right into

[1:19:21] know I don't care
[1:19:25] whether's whether there's an article add
[1:19:27] about it doesn't make any difference to
[1:19:28] me at all amen first of all I believe
[1:19:33] brother brandom and every other thing so
[1:19:35] why don't I believe him with that
[1:19:37] whether there's an article that says it
[1:19:38] was or not amen and even if I
[1:19:42] don't has nothing to do with my
[1:19:44] salvation whatsoever yes
[1:19:47] amen nothing the bridge falling and
[1:19:50] those men going in have nothing to do
[1:19:53] you notice and see all the attacks that
[1:19:56] people have and these are veils by the
[1:19:59] way that we're talking about all these
[1:20:01] things that people come against to talk
[1:20:03] about it usually in fact almost never
[1:20:06] has anything to do with the word right
[1:20:08] and the message of what he preached amen
[1:20:11] they hit his maybe brother Ram's
[1:20:14] personal opinions on things and
[1:20:17] sometimes you got weigh the personal
[1:20:18] opinion based on the fact that he
[1:20:20] preached in
[1:20:21] 1940 or 1950 which is whole
[1:20:25] different this is a whole different
[1:20:27] world then amen or they they judge him
[1:20:31] based on uh of uh some fact that was
[1:20:35] wrong or
[1:20:37] something
[1:20:39] okay I don't care what I care about is
[1:20:42] the word and what I see in the word is
[1:20:45] what he preached in this word is
[1:20:48] 100% that's what's going to put dress me
[1:20:51] and put me in a Rapture as a bride of
[1:20:53] Jesus Christ not the stories stories are
[1:20:55] good I like them I believe them amen but
[1:20:59] you notice that when they hit that's
[1:21:00] what they talk about yes
[1:21:06] amen that's neither here or there but
[1:21:08] you see that's just a veil and people
[1:21:10] use those veils see if that but if
[1:21:14] somebody comes along if they use brother
[1:21:16] brandom as their Veil and somebody comes
[1:21:18] along it kind of rips that away from
[1:21:20] them what do they
[1:21:22] have they they're safety net has been
[1:21:25] pulled out from under them what happens
[1:21:28] when that preacher Falls or that church
[1:21:31] folds what happens in what where does
[1:21:34] your Veil go people use religion as
[1:21:37] their Veil how many times people talk
[1:21:39] about well he's not very
[1:21:42] religious praise God I'm
[1:21:45] glad amen people talk sometimes at work
[1:21:49] about oh he's religious I said no I'm
[1:21:51] not
[1:21:52] religious now people think something
[1:21:54] different about that but then I go on
[1:21:56] and explain it see understand religion
[1:21:58] is just a covering all religion is
[1:22:01] something to make you feel good it's a
[1:22:03] veil it's a veil to try to make a person

[1:23:03] self-righteousness as their own religion
[1:23:06] amen I I it's actually even come out to
[1:23:09] some people that claim to be Christians
[1:23:10] say they're their own
[1:23:12] God you you are your own God
[1:23:16] self-righteous piety right amen I'm so

[1:24:05] do have the opportunity to actually make
[1:24:07] up our own minds how we want to live
[1:24:10] what we want to believe amen
[1:24:13] amen we train our children in the way
[1:24:16] that we want them to go but it's up to
[1:24:19] them to decide which way they want to
[1:24:21] choose to go amen I believe if you've
[1:24:24] taught him right and you've taught him
[1:24:27] by the scripture that will not depart
[1:24:29] from them because that's the word right
[1:24:32] amen but that is that is a holy Veil
[1:24:36] that is a that is a a Holiness that is
[1:24:39] over that person will be over that
[1:24:41] person their whole
[1:24:42] lives not not a veil now now you can't
[1:24:45] offer them a veil say well we raised
[1:24:48] them in church well what church did you
[1:24:49] raise them
[1:24:51] in did you did you uh ra him in a a
[1:24:56] place that doesn't even preach the word
[1:24:58] of God or doesn't believe in a standard
[1:25:01] of living or doesn't believe in a
[1:25:03] standard of Holiness of any kind I mean
[1:25:05] you know if if you raise them in the
[1:25:07] word that's one thing right if you raise
[1:25:10] them in church that's another thing amen
[1:25:14] there's a difference people still hiding
[1:25:18] in those veils hiding behind those veils
[1:25:21] a veil a veil is something a thing that
[1:25:26] covers a veil is something that
[1:25:29] conceals a veil is also something that
[1:25:32] disguises according to the dictionary
[1:25:34] according to uh uh the meanings a veil
[1:25:37] is also something that disguises it
[1:25:40] brings a disguise to make something look
[1:25:43] like something that it's not amen kind
[1:25:46] of like the little kitties do or not our
[1:25:49] kitties hopefully but uh worldly kitties
[1:25:52] do on Halloween they wear guys amen
[1:25:55] because they want to go look like
[1:25:57] something that they're not pretend
[1:25:59] they're something that they're not amen
[1:26:02] that's the same thing a veil can
[1:26:05] disguise bring a disguise I want to read
[1:26:09] this quote here I got one more scripture
[1:26:10] I want to read and then I'm going to
[1:26:11] close because there's several other
[1:26:14] parts of this probably but um Satan's
[1:26:19] Eden 1965 notice how much alike man
[1:26:24] how much alike man and his wife now
[1:26:28] notice man and wife both naked in the
[1:26:30] Garden of Eden uh God's eeden now I'm
[1:26:33] going to close it I'm going to um hold
[1:26:37] just a few more more minutes compare
[1:26:39] this now how much alike that man and his
[1:26:42] wife both in God's Eden without One S of
[1:26:46] clothes on them and knew it not now he
[1:26:48] says they didn't know
[1:26:50] it um I think if I'm looking at you how
[1:26:55] how would I not know I I I would know
[1:27:00] because I'm looking at you now I don't
[1:27:03] realize the nakedness to the part of
[1:27:06] shame or or recognize it because it's
[1:27:09] because there's a holy
[1:27:11] Veil um the the nakedness the nakedness
[1:27:16] and know it not is
[1:27:18] today amen with no shame right for why
[1:27:23] didn't they know it for they were veiled
[1:27:26] to their senses of nakedness by the holy
[1:27:28] veil of the Holy Spirit they could look
[1:27:31] right at each other and didn't know that
[1:27:34] they was naked they were veiled with the
[1:27:37] Holy Spirit of Holiness they were
[1:27:40] veiled God's Veil yet today can look and
[1:27:43] not lust they turn their head it's a
[1:27:46] holy Veil holy Veil
[1:27:50] amen God U
[1:27:54] had their eyes they were both one uh one
[1:27:57] was man the other was woman didn't know
[1:27:59] they they could because the Holiness of
[1:28:01] God kept their eyes veiled the spiritual
[1:28:05] part of their of their eye amen it's
[1:28:09] like Gaza which we may talk about later
[1:28:12] I'm not sure I haven't gotten that far
[1:28:13] but it's like
[1:28:15] Gesa uh Gesa could see just like you and
[1:28:19] me but when uh when the prophet came and
[1:28:22] said God uh it said what are you worried
[1:28:25] about young man there's more with us
[1:28:27] than there are with them right he
[1:28:29] couldn't see
[1:28:30] them what did what did he what did he
[1:28:33] ask God to do for the man for Gaz he
[1:28:35] said God open his eyes and when God
[1:28:39] opened his eyes what' he see he saw
[1:28:42] chariots and angels and Chariots of Fire
[1:28:45] All Surrounded all around about them
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:49] amen but one of the unique Parts about
[1:28:53] that story is even with all the it gives
[1:28:57] Comfort but none of none of all the
[1:29:01] angels and Chariots of Fire and flaming
[1:29:03] swords drawn they marched down there and
[1:29:07] God just blinded their
[1:29:09] eyes so he opened gaza's eyes to see all
[1:29:12] the Chariots and angels and fire and
[1:29:14] angels and when the enemy come in they
[1:29:18] he blinded their
[1:29:20] eyes amen y praise the they could still
[1:29:25] see but they didn't
[1:29:27] recognize amen God lifted the veil off
[1:29:31] the Gaze and put the veil on
[1:29:33] them so they became blind to what was
[1:29:36] there what was what was actually
[1:29:38] standing in front of them right the
[1:29:41] Holiness of God the Holiness of God
[1:29:43] listen to this now the Holiness of God
[1:29:46] kept their eyes Veil a spiritual Veil
[1:29:50] not not a natural Veil as we talked
[1:29:53] about with the bride a spiritual Veil
[1:29:55] spiritual Veil notice a holy Veil uh God
[1:30:00] hid their conscience from sin by the
[1:30:03] holy Veil he said wish we had time on
[1:30:05] that but look here for he the worshipper
[1:30:08] once purged was no more conscience of
[1:30:11] sin sin is passed from him passed from
[1:30:14] Death unto life amen I said I was going
[1:30:18] to read this one more scripture over in
[1:30:22] Daniel I'll probably I'll to make this
[1:30:27] short Daniel chapter
[1:30:34] 3 amen Daniel chapter
[1:30:42] 3
[1:30:43] uh let's see I was going to kind of read
[1:30:46] more than I
[1:30:49] was uh let's start with
[1:30:52] U let's start with with verse 14 Daniel
[1:30:57] 3:14 talking about three Hebrew children
[1:31:00] their denial to bow down to the golden
[1:31:03] image which we know is Daniel that
[1:31:05] Nebuchadnezzar commanded everybody there
[1:31:08] in his kingdom to bow down to this image
[1:31:10] to worship this in right Shadrach
[1:31:12] Meshach vindo would not do it amen so we
[1:31:16] pick up the story uh 14th verse
[1:31:19] Nebuchadnezzar let's start with 13 then
[1:31:21] Nebuchadnezzar we got to the plag they
[1:31:23] would not b bow down so we pick up there
[1:31:25] then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[1:31:28] commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and
[1:31:30] abedo then they were brought then they
[1:31:33] uh brought these men before the King
[1:31:36] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[1:31:40] is it true old Shadrach meach and
[1:31:43] Abednego do not ye serve my gods nor
[1:31:46] worship the golden image which I have
[1:31:48] set up now if ye be ready that at what
[1:31:53] time ye hear the sound of the Cornet the
[1:31:56] flute harp sackbut Sury and damer and
[1:32:02] all kinds of music ye Fall Down and
[1:32:04] Worship the image which I have made well
[1:32:07] but if ye worship not you shall be cast
[1:32:11] that same hour into the midst of a
[1:32:14] burning fiery furnace and who is that
[1:32:17] God that shall deliver you out of my
[1:32:21] hands Shadrach Meshach and Indigo
[1:32:24] answered and said oh keing oh
[1:32:28] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:32:31] answer thee in this matter in fact we've
[1:32:32] had we've taken this under very cons
[1:32:35] strong consideration we're not giving
[1:32:37] this or saying this to you lightly we
[1:32:40] understand we understand the
[1:32:43] consequences amen if it be so our God
[1:32:48] whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From
[1:32:50] The Burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:32:53] Deliver Us out of thine hand out of your
[1:32:55] hand oh King
[1:32:57] amen but if not but if
[1:33:01] not be it known unto thee Oh King that
[1:33:04] we will not serve thy Gods nor worship
[1:33:07] the golden image which thou Hast set up
[1:33:10] amen then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
[1:33:13] Fury and the form of his Vis Visage was
[1:33:17] uh changed against Shadrach Meshach and
[1:33:19] abedo therefore because these were good
[1:33:22] men these were men that he had put in a
[1:33:24] a place of stature position I this is
[1:33:28] like a captain in the Army this is not
[1:33:31] just a flunkies that you just don't care
[1:33:33] about he cared about them that's why he
[1:33:37] give them a chance to understand you
[1:33:40] serve
[1:33:41] me you you worship the god I worship
[1:33:44] with golden image that i' made who is
[1:33:47] going to withstand you against
[1:33:50] me they said the god that we serve will
[1:33:53] amen and even if he doesn't we're not
[1:33:55] bound down to your image that's why he
[1:33:58] got upset he's full of Fury and his
[1:34:00] Visage
[1:34:01] changed because these were good men he
[1:34:03] didn't want to do this but he already
[1:34:06] made a
[1:34:09] decree changed against Shadrach meach
[1:34:11] and abedo therefore he spake and
[1:34:13] commanded that they should heat the

[1:34:46] commandment was urgent and the furnace
[1:34:49] exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew
[1:34:53] those men that took up Shadrach mesach
[1:34:56] and abedo the men that took them up to
[1:35:00] throw into the furnace were burned
[1:35:03] up they didn't go in the furnace but the
[1:35:06] furnace was so hot and they were in such
[1:35:09] haste to throw them in there that they
[1:35:12] got burned up just standing on the
