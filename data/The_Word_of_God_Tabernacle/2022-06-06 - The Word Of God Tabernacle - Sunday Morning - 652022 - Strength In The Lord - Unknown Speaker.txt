lord jesus we bow our hearts and heads in unison of the face yes knowing father as this has been said by you one of your prophets said it was great to dwell together in unity yes and let your holy spirit have preeminence father teach us our ways your ways be a lamp unto our feet enlightened to our time amen yes but we know truly you are the way the truth and the life and lord i just read in your book proverbs where it was said that he that despises the word shall be destroyed but he that enlightens and loves the word shall be rewarded amen we are in a in time where satan is fighting the true believer harder than ever before we know all houses against this message against this word father we know how you are the word the lie and jesus in the word is one and to fight your word your message in this day is to fight you father and we don't want to be guilty of that father we want to be identified with your word we want to be recognized today and the message and the hour that we're living in father we know the enemy knows his bag tricks is running down and he's fighting us harder than ever before but greater heed us in us than he is in the world help us to recognize to stay with the word i heard your prophet earlier this week saying that we are here one time to serve you there's no second chances there's not a do-over father let our lives count for you and everything that we do let us be identified with your word and everything that speaks to our lives will be actions identified with your word father help us to discern what is right even with the people we associate with even with the music we listen to even though the movies and the in the shows we watch on television there are the books that we read lord satan is this crafty he smiled but lord as we yield to you you can teach us what is right you can give me that discernment to identify with your words and especially now as we come together with these requests father we can't come with faith muscles bulging out with with the belief that whatever we ask we shall receive and father there are some that are sick our sister julie and others that are sick and need a touch from you yes one touch from you father

acquired for us at calvary and we claim the healing for each and every one and all the other requests you know the hearts of your people they're asking and they're believing and they know that father

ephesians chapter six we'll read one verse of scripture let you be seated amen but i want to read a good portion of chapter 6 today ephesians chapter 6. we'll just read verse 10 amen let me be seated but before we do that this is our heads for word of prayer for good and precious jesus it's indeed a privilege to be here again lord in the house of god thank you for this sanctuary that you've given us lord to get in from out of the world lord and it is truly as we've determined at a sanctuary the house of god a place of worship that we come in lord to worship and to praise you expecting you to meet with us lord as you always do and lord to manifest yourself in power and demonstration thank you so much lord for the grace and mercy you give in our lives lord in bringing us through another week lord and giving us desire in our hearts lord no doubt many people around the world today around this country this place that we consider a christian nation lord that lord didn't maybe even give going to church a second thought this morning wasn't a desire in their hearts wasn't something they wanted to do it wasn't something that's a part of their lives lord but god it is our life lord and we thank you for the ability for the place for the desire for the time that we can come into your house once again and expect to meet with you lord and expect you to speak to us lord and for you god to draw us closer to you through this word and through all that you do and by your holy spirit lord drawing us and bringing us to that place of perfection in you looking for a time god you call us home to be with you thank you lord for those that have come i pray you bless and help those who weren't able to make it for whatever reason lord those that are sick and body need you this morning we're believing god that your healing virtues move upon them strengthen and bless and touch them once again today help us lord as we hear god expecting to hear from you feeling your spirit pulsating through this place once again today to have your preeminence lord we'll rebuke every demonic spirit that will try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here today lord for it's all about you god our praise our worship goes to you everything about this everything that we're doing here lord we come in the name of jesus christ our lord and savior and that is where you meet the worshiper so have your way lord we committed to you now once again and ask your blessings in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen ephesians chapter six we'll read one verse let you be seen in verse 10. verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the lord and then the power of his might you can be seated if you like and i want to go back to the first verse i want to speak on this morning on strong in the lord something that the lord had given me this week that i'm not really sure why but sometimes there's times that i don't really know why the lord puts a subject or something on my heart but there's always a reason for it so i'm doing so i try by by the grace of god not to take my own mind about it or my own way of what i want to do or what i want to say or any notes or scriptures or quotes or anything and just preach what the lord puts on my heart so it derives from this scripture be strong in the lord being strong in the lord but now i want to go back to the first verse and i want to read a good portion actually of the sixth chapter focusing on that tenth verse there and the title of course strong in the lord today first verse says ephesians 6 1 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ not with i service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good anything any good thing any man doeth the same shall be received of the lord whether he be bond or free and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with the truth and having the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take this shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints amen it's quite a powerful reading of the scripture that the that uh paul gives to the ephesian church we know of course the ephesian churches brother brown teaches us was the strongest more spiritually stable a church that there was there in those of those churches that were there was the church of ephesus and that's why paul took it upon him to himself to teach to the church of ephesus things that were more spiritual binding and needful and and in more depth if you will it was about get along with this guy and don't say wrong things to this person don't have bitterness and don't have hardness and all those things are important but uh paul struck down to some very deep subjects when he began to talk to the current to the ephesian church and and helping us understand uh what we're facing today and being strong in the lord is one of those things now uh as we get to this topic this subject of strong in the lord uh the first thing that struck my mind is when that thought came when i first saw that uh i started to wonder what does it mean to be strong in the lord and if you think that in yourself i think a lot of times we read over scripture it says be strong in the lord oh okay i'll be strong with the lord. but what does that mean what does it mean to be strong in the lord i know what it means to be strong amen i know what it means to be physically strong i know what it means to have uh bulking muscles and be able to lift huge weights and and being strong physically to uh to be able to withstand certain obstacles in life physically i understand what that means but that just means a person that's strong uh but that's not what the scripture is saying the scripture is saying be strong in the lord amen what does it mean to be strong in the lord because that's a to me that's a completely different thing than even just being strong and even being strong spiritually you can be strong a person can be strong spiritually but not be strong in the lord there's a complete different thing to me as i look at it but the only way that you can be strong in the lord is for you to allow your life to let god have his way in you and through you amen that's the only way you're going to be strong in the lord yet a person might can be strong but and our strength can only take us so far as we're mentally strong or we're physically strong or emotionally strong and uh some people are stronger than others it seems like today the mental strength of people is going away we've becoming uh a society of of a mentally a society of mush we might have people as healthier we might have people living longer we might have people that are stronger than they used to be but mentally it seems like we're turned into much uh where we've just become a a a a what's that term that they use today um snowflakes uh i guess that's the term that you use mentally a snowflake something that uh has a a very low tolerance has a has a very short self shelf life uh someone that you can't touch or it'll disintegrate and fall apart uh they have to have their safe space now don't say anything hurtful or derogatory don't don't tell the truth about things because you might hurt somebody's feelings oh my goodness um if you can't have your feelings hurt a little bit every once in a while then uh we we're in bad shape friends i mean if you break it right down to it uh something is there to offend somebody every day if you live your life you're going to be hurt if you live your life you're going to be offended if you live your life your feelings are going to get hurt it just happens yeah amen so that kind of strength seems to be waning a little bit so that that's what the world offers but what we want to talk about is what it means to be strong in the lord amen to be strong in the lord where nothing rattles you nothing worries you you don't worry about things now being concerned about something is different to me than worry we pray over things and we trust the lord we believe god is going to move on that situation but it's not something that we consistently and and constantly worry about that we worry over that just shows that we're not strong in the lord we're only trying to use our own strength we're trying to use our own strength to withstand whatever the situation is and friend that just doesn't last you'll fold under the pressure of some uh trials that come in our lives we're just not the strength in ourselves to be able to do that we have to be strong in the lord and to be able to be strong in the lord and in the power of his might not my strength not my might i might try to fix it i might try to do something about it i might try to uh know what's better of a way to to manipulate this than god does but i don't the the truth of the matter is i don't i don't know a better way i don't know how to do it better i don't have a better idea about it so my strength needs to come in the settling of the lord to be settled in the lord so so that whatever comes i'm able to withstand it by the strength of the lord and the power of his might his might in me now being strong of the lord has got to now now i can we can go over the things about being strong in the lord building your strength uh brother adam talked about exercising your faith exercising your faith because uh the faith of god has has big muscles and hair on his chest but see brother random wasn't talking about physically he was talking about spiritually he was talking about a person built up to the place that no matter what comes their way they stand firm they stand steady no matter what it looks like feels like no matter what the circumstances present themselves as we stand steady and firm in the lord we're not rattled by it whatever comes we're not rattled by it we don't worry about it because we're we're depending on god we're trusting on the lord we have faith in god whatever god has done for us what god will always do and whatever god has done for somebody else whatever god has done through these scriptures not even necessarily to me before but in the word he has to do the same thing all the way through he's not god i can be strong to understand that god is in control i don't want to be in control how many of you tried to been in control and just ruined the whole picture amen i feel like sometimes that's been my life i've tried to take control over things and it just turned into a mess because i don't know i've got to be strong in the lord i've got to hold steady fast firm let nothing rather you because that's the thing that the devil wants to do is to rattle your faith is to get you internal back and forth now again i we can talk and and and i can i can bring you the scripture and the quotes and things that we talk about uh praying and having a good prayer life and and reading the scripture and having a a time that we that we're in the word of god and we're listening to the message and we're we're strengthening ourselves in the lord by all those things but friend you know all those things i don't i can remind you of those things i can remind myself of those things because they are ultimately extremely important in our spiritual strength in our faith in the lord because those things is what we draw strength from the word i believe that's why we're here this morning even we draw strength from that word we draw strength from one another we draw strength being in this presence of the holy spirit we draw strength from listening to the word and letting god minister to us and letting that word reveal itself to us and feeling strengthened that when we go out in the world we're able to withstand anything the devil might try to put before us yes because we're strong in him not strong in me i'm not depending on myself i'm not depending on my righteousness i'm depending on him and what his righteousness is and what he has given and done for me in my life in your life we stand strong sure all those things are important all those things are needful read your bible pray every day absolutely all those things we should do those because those are the things that bring us strength but the resulting element of it is the strength of god in my life in the power of his mind that's what i stand by now that being said which is the truth that being said it goes on to tell us that we put on the whole armor of god amen we put on the whole armor of god be strong in the lord and the power of his might but we also put on the whole armor of god and that whole armor of god that was just described here that talks about the uh the our loins girded with truth the the breastplate of righteousness our feet shod with the gospel of preparation gospel of peace shield of faith that we are able to withstand the fiery darts of the enemy the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit the sword of the spirit amen amen that sword of the spirit that god give us to destroy the enemy with amen look what brother branham says about that we all know about the situation that brother branham went into when he was up on in sabino canyon and what we call pulpit rock or uh sword mountain or whatever anyone's verbiage might be to call it uh we all have everybody here been there yes we all been to sword sword mountain or they call pulpit rock or whatever uh anyway it's uh it's a bit of a hike and up a mountain if you haven't been there um i'd encourage you to but um i don't know how many of us would be able to make it in the heat the way it is today i've done a lot of uh i've done a lot of sabino tours in july and i i just soon not do another one but if somebody comes overseas out of town or something you know i would i would do it again i've had somebody a sister matisse even talked about wanting the church to take a pilgrimage up to sabine i said sister why didn't you say this in october november or something might have had a little bit of better participation uh going up so well we can go early but see the tram doesn't start running till i think nine o'clock uh so to get up there at six you're gonna have to walk and it's almost four miles from parking lot to the top and then you gotta go up switch back all the way up and up and up and and it's at least four hours if you take the tram uh but it's it's it's worth it i've done it dozens of times i guess and in the summer and a lot of times i've taken people and i tell them ahead of time make sure blink bring plenty of water they bring a bottle i learned to take about 10 bottles of water because i'm end up giving eight of them away and try to have a couple for myself but it's hot up there um but but fantastic supernatural things happened up there so it's it's a place that i appreciate going to and and i'm always blessed to go there and i'm and i'm blessed and thankful of the things that uh brother greene taught us and pictures he found and and brother branham's desk and stuff to help us understand exactly where these things were and uh it it to me is a special thing and i i i'd go on a heartbeat going times to just pray uh but um uh but i enjoy taking people and taking their for the first time i've gone with people and every stop we'd stop bring people from the congo and every stop we stopped at they'd take a half hour to pray every stop eagle rock and and then uh a sword mountain and then and dove cove and all the place and they'd sit and pray for a half hour at every spot i tell you in the presence of god would come it's just beautiful but anyway this outstanding thing that happened we know that when brother brown was up there he was praying one time and he had his hands lifted up and he said and he felt something hit his hand and it and he looked at it it was a sword and i'm telling you this to re refresh your memory on the story and those who may watch you don't know the sword hit his hand he opened his eyes and looked and the sword was glistening in the sun and then he started speaking and talking to himself and and a voice spoke back and said that is the king's sword now we get to the quote here this is this one is particularly from the breach message that voice said that is the king's sword and i thought if it would have said a king's sword it might have been that i would have understood it but it said the king's sword amen which we just read we know what that sword is right amen we know what that sword is we just read it in the scripture it's the king's sword so i may not have this right thought but there's only one the king and that is god and his sword here is sharper than in two edges sword as you abide in me and my words abide in you in dueling you see now this is the part i want to get to in dueling you see i don't understand one word of it or one principle of dueling but the best of my understanding the knife striking across finally the swords coming and striking one another and when the swords lock uh if they lock with the enemy and you lock the swords and the swords come together and they lock together uh like this it takes the strength of the man dueling because see his sword would be pointed at my heart mine to his heart but you're locked these swords striking together locked together and then they strike and when these swords come together the one that can shove the other one down shove the sword straight to the heart is the strength of the one who's doing so it takes the strength of the dueler to take the sword of the word to the heart of the enemy it takes the strength of the dueler now are you any match to the devil no i am not as strong in that spiritual context as he is but in christ the lord god has given me and supplied us with the strength with the power with the ability to be able to take this sword and drive it to the heart of the enemy satan is the enemy how many times have you locked swords with him well how many days have i been alive amen every day the devil tries to lock swords with me every day i lock swords with that devil bringing them together and it takes the strength now it's again the strength that the lord has supplied to us the strength that the lord has given me to once again in this new day to take that sword to bring it right through the heart of the enemy praise the lord defeat that enemy on the spot because he has no authority over you he has no authority over a child of god and we are strong in the lord and in the power of his might so it takes the strength of the dueler so where is our strength my strength is in the lord to be strong in the lord amen in jesus christ's name when we pray and when we ask the lord for things when we bless our meals we don't say in in the name of dennis katie or in the name of shelia truman or in the name of newton bennett we say it in the name of the lord jesus christ that takes that sword to the heart of that enemy because he cannot withstand that name amen the name of jesus christ when it said in faith believing amen now there's plenty of people that utter the name plenty of people that uttered in in vain and in cursing they utter that name but when it's said with faith from the heart of a believer it'll shake the very foundations of hell and take that sword to the heart of the enemy amen you've got to know what your sword is now okay so now where is my strengthening come from my strength coming from the lord where does my help come from my health coming from the lord but what is our sword our sword is the word amen how do we know how to be able to use our sword unless we know what it says yes we have to know what the word says we have to know every promise in this book is mine every promise that god promised me every story every chapter every line brother brandon even gone so far as to say every jot and tittle which basically just means exclamations and punctuation amen job title punctuation every exclamation point every comma every verily verily barely we know the word well that's the only way you're going to be able to take the word the sword to the heart of the enemy oh it sounds wonderful to think oh if i just take that sword in and we always think well that's some natural uh uh metaphor that we come up with no no no no it's the word the word is that sword that's what you take to the heart of the enemy the strength of your faith in that word to know how to take it to the heart of the enemy that was eve's problem in the beginning the woman's problem in the beginning eventually was as strong in the word as the devil was as the enemy was so he was able to deceive her you know there's many gonna fall by the wayside because they don't have a fundamental revelation of the word of god to be able to have that sword in their holster ready to take it to the heart of the enemy at any time there's people just don't have it she knew it she had heard it intellectually in her mind she knew what adam had told her god said don't do this but intellects won't take it to the heart of the enemy being able to memorize it does not take it to the heart of the enemy amen those things are fine you can memorize the scripture cover to cover that's fine but it takes the strength of the dueler to take it to the heart of the enemy amen amen the strength doesn't come from my intellect the strength doesn't come with how good i can remember something my strength comes from my position and my placement and my my faith in the lord jesus who i am who i am who am i in him that's what the strength comes from who am i i cannot let my heart deceive me i cannot let my heart condemn me as john said i cannot because if my heart condemns me i can't have victory over the enemy i can't have strength right i'm not going to be able to withstand when that enemy comes to bring whatever it is to me to my family to my life whatever it might be i won't be able to withstand it if my heart condemned me why because you don't have the faith that you need amen abraham was strong in the lord giving him praise and thanks even though it took 25 years for the promised son to come about he was strong in the lord in faith believing that the god that's done this and the god that did that the god that brought me through here and the god that saw us through here is the same god that's going to see me the rest of the way through strong in the lord no matter what the time frame is no matter how impossible it might look we're strong in the lord he stood strong in the lord now let's look at this scripture in first timothy chapter four first timothy chapter four we'll start with verse one here as well first timothy 4 1. now the spirit speaketh expressively i mean specifically to the point expressedly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils those are people that did not have the strength of the lord of the sword of the word to take to the heart of the enemy they became deceived by whatever wiles the enemy brought their path just like in the beginning just like even the beginning whatever the enemy would bring spirit of seducing and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron and the blind can't know it if you're blind to it you don't know [Music] correct forbidding to marry listen to this now my this just don't speak of this last day see forbidden to marry and commanding to abstain from meats commanding that you abstain from meat my mind but look what the lord says abstain from me which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of god is good and nothing can be refused if it be received with thanksgiving i see that's the problem people have that to me is the problem a lot of people have they don't have the faith to believe when they bow their head at the table that what they're about to consume is blessed and nourished to strengthen and bless our bodies they just don't have the faith it becomes a ritual meal time prayers become a ritual it becomes something that we just do because we're supposed to well that's just as much a stink in god's nostrils as in isaiah when they took their lambs and they went to go drag their lambs down and say i gotta go sacrifice today and no emotion no feeling no heart they just do it cause they got to do it it's a job it becomes a ritual it becomes a ritual to people and they don't believe saints we have to know when we bow our heads or when we approach the father when we speak to him in whatever capacity wherever we are for whatever reason he hears us and he answers our prayer amen strong in the lord yes strong in the lord if it be it is for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer sanctified by the word of god and prayer praise the lord that's good i like that if thou put the brother in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and extra listen to this now exercise thyself rather unto godliness there we go now exercise ourselves unto godliness now when we hear the word exercise we always think about lifting weights and pumping iron and running down the street and the exercise of jumping jacks and all this and all those things are fine that that's good there's nothing wrong with those things absolutely uh but it used to be men got it because they worked for a living now they build gyms everywhere which you can is okay because times have changed and those things change but but the point is that we are to as christians exercise ourselves rather to godliness amen not necessarily to a pumped up body being in shape is fine physically and absolutely i don't have anything against that uh but extras but the more important exercise that we have is to exercise ourselves unto godliness the practices that we practice the drills that we put ourselves through the things that we attain to in life again such as coming to church praying reading our bibles consecrating ourselves putting on a tape whatever it might be a message that exercises us unto godliness that doesn't build muscles in our body but it exercises us unto godliness yes amen because friend this that we're talking about it's a life this is a life lived it's not something that just happens today and then goes away tomorrow this is a life that is lived that we're supposed to do the only way to be strong in the lord is for a life for your life to be lived to exercise and to demonstrate and to show that uh uh that that that's a life of godliness not not humanity not me but of godliness see exercise rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little now it does profit just profits little but it still does profit or for a little while amen but godliness is profitable unto all things amen having promised of the life that that now is and of that which is to come that exercising of godliness this is a faithful saying worthy of all exception that exercise unto godliness so what is it that not negating the exercise brother adam even talked about uh of course he hunted all the time so he got all kinds of exercise walking up down mountains hilly hills valleys and i i've gone to sunset mountain over where brother banham uh probably would have been according to the map and the tapes and everything and oh my goodness just to get over there uh is quite a track but uh he got a lot of exercise but he talked about billy graham that billy graham was getting so tired he couldn't hardly preach his sermons and he went to the doctor doctor said well you're wasting away billy you got to do some exercise you got to exercise your body so there is a value to exercising your body but the po but the importance should be on the exercising of the godliness yes amen not just the body but the exercising of godliness making sure that your priorities are in the right place because that's how you become strong in the lord not just strong but strong in the lord exercising unto godliness and that godliness is a life yes you're not just godly in church you're not just godly in front of the people that matter you're not just godly in front of the pastor or those in the church your godliness is your life yes it's how you live it's who you are it's what you become yes that godliness is you in in in in flash form it it's sort of like a um and it's not just in coming to church right it's not just being a christian on sunday or wednesday or whatever it is it's not just being east or christmas it's sort of like it's sort of like learning a new language is anybody more do anybody here know more than one language i don't i think michael knows three or four or at least parts of them anyway but i don't i don't i know a few words of spanish i might know a word or two here and there of a different language or something i don't know uh i have never been proficient in another language i have set out to learn spanish especially living in tunisia and i should be able to speak spanish living in tucson although i think everybody that's in america should learn how to speak english that's my opinion but um but just as if i were to go to mexico and try to live there i think i should learn how to speak spanish right i just that's just i just if i go to france i think i should learn how to speak french i should not obligate those people to learn english so they can communicate with me i should learn how to speak french because i'm in their country anyway yes uh that's a soapbox so but it's like learning that language i've learned a fair amount of spanish from time to time but you you might learn some words you might learn some phrases you might learn uh the alphabet or something to that effect but friend if you don't use it if you don't if it doesn't become common to you to where it's something that you use regularly those things tend to go away they slip just hebrews 2 tells us not to let these things slip see those things will just slip if it doesn't become a life that's lived if it doesn't come something that we do on a daily basis to where it really becomes as we would say second nature although i would consider it to be first nature because it is our life but as the world term would say second nature second nature is like the bicycle writing they say once you learn how to ride a bike you never forget but there are things like that that go with uh learning how to ride a bike you can learn how to ride a bike never ride a bike 20 years later you still going to ride that bike well i know how to ride a bike but i rode a bike for the first 20 years of my life or 15 years or whatever so i did it proficiently you understand it becomes life not just oh i come to church here and there uh i i i might come on easter i might come on christmas or you know uh well i i i might do a little this i might do but see if it's not a life live yes there's not going to be enough strength in the lord there to be able to withstand the walls of the devil yes it's just not going to be there when if i just learned a few words of spanish or let's just say i learned a few phrases and i go down to mexico or something and somebody's just talking and talking to the doctor but like i have no idea what you're talking about i i don't know what you're saying you know i i've gone to mexican restaurants before and and and say a little spanish phrase that i know and the waiter just starts gabbing and gavin and gavin i'm no way but that's all i know i don't know i i said here i told you every spanish i know that's it so i have no idea what you're talking about get myself in trouble but if you're not proficient enough at something see again it becomes life it becomes something that you should do exercise every day every day amen even if you even if you do physical exercise i've seen people and known people to get buffed and big and even kind of my brother my brother when he was a young kid um 16 17 he got really strong my brother got uh he worked out i mean he was religious about it he was faithful to it even in the old times where uh they had different kind of weights it was more of a challenge to actually start working out than what they've got today and just rubber bands and stuff you know or whatever they are but my brother he had things you had to strap your feet and all this stuff and but he got big he got strong but when he got later in life and he was sitting in a van driving for a living or in a truck driving for a living those muscles started going from up here to down here because he didn't exercise it didn't take care of it well that's what happens to our spiritual life we might be up here now for just a moment but then if we don't keep it as a part of our life yeah if it doesn't become a part of our godliness our godly living then our muscles go from here to here right amen or from here to here see it doesn't stay because it's not something that's going to hold it has to be a life that life is a faith that faith that cannot that that true unadulterated faith that cannot be mixed with anything else there could be no leaven in that faith there cannot be any doubt in your faith there can't be any reasoning in your faith abraham stood strong in the lord and god uttered him for it he stood strong in the lord and that's what we are to do god told god told joshua when he took moses off the scene he told josh he said be strong and of a good courage but why did he tell him that or what did he tell him after that be strong and of a good courage because i will be with you whether so ever thou goest praise the lord amen my friends what a what an encouragement for us to believe that the lord is with us to be strong in the lord to be stronger than to know he is with us he never leaves us or forsakes us he's always there with us amen praise the lord our faith can't be mixed with anything now first corinthians chapter 16. talking about that life lived let me as you're turning there to first corinthians 16. let me read this quote to you uncertain sound december 1960 and yet the man somewhere down in him somewhere in him if he could only let that little he said as i illustrated it a little button you see a little button here just on my sleeve a little button when a man is saved that much of him is god that's the little light that comes in to make him quit doing what's wrong that little life holy spirit god that comes in there that keeps him and and causes him to stop doing the things that are wrong now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelieve out and let that little button of light and the power of god it will keep growing here we go now it'll keep growing growing growing growing crowding out all unbelief growing but see that's what it has to do it has to grow it has to grow it has to grow i don't take one lesson of spanish and be able to go to mexico and speak fluently to someone who's been their whole life i can't do that amen you don't take one lesson and all of a sudden you've got it you're there no there it takes a process you grow in the lord growing that little button that light growing so well i'm born again yeah but you've got to continue to grow in the lord you've got to continue to strengthen the lord you've got to continue to allow the spirit of god to strengthen you in that word amen in that word strengthen you in that word praise the lord that word and as it grows and it grows and it grows brother adam said it crowds out all the unbelief praise the lord well if you crowd out all the unbelief what's left faith am i faith in god your heart doesn't condemn you why because you're living a godly life yes a holy life you're living a life that's pleasing to the lord jesus that's what brings strength that when other things come then you're able to withstand them crowding out unbelief all all unbelief and you don't uh and you don't do it by exhortations of bodily exercise you do it by a sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you i caught some of it in the places here where not long ago he said now that sanctified consecrated life there we go sanctified consecrated life with the holy spirit moving through you all unbelief crowded out nothing but a sword of the word and faith to drive it to the heart of the enemy a strong hand a strong hand of faith to drive that to the heart of the enemy strong in the lord joshua be strong and of a good courage abraham strong in the lord believing that what god said he would do because we're strong in the power of his mind not the power of my might my might will fail me first corinthians chapter 16 verse verse 13. look down watchy stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong now that that sounds really strange but the word quick there just means to be brave yes be courageous and brave so watch ye stand fast in the faith and be brave courageous like men and be strong be strong courageous stand fast let the strength of the lord pulsate through you to take that word to the heart of the enemy let all your things be done with charity amen which we spoke of the scriptures here just a little bit earlier exercising our faith not staggering right not taking control of it of ourselves but believing that the strength the lord has given me now some people they think that they just that some comes and they just stand back and say okay lord you do it doesn't work that way you know you put on the whole armor of god when when the red part when this red sea was parted what did god say god told moses you get up on your feet and you speak hold that rod over so there was something moses had to do right there was a part moses had to play and that's the same in our lives we don't just sit back and say okay god you just take care of it right no there's a part we play right in that that we in our prayer life in our faith amen and putting a hand to it i mean brother pat can sit there on his seat there and he can say okay lord i want my 51 chevy put my 51 4 put together i'm waiting there's the tools tools are over parts are all just put it together for me lord no god knows how it goes together amen of course so does brother pat but he's had a lot of practice but god knows how to put it together the god has to take a man to put the wrench in his hand to put it to the bowl yes god has to have a man to take to put the sword in his hand and take it to the enemy god's got to take you and let you the strength of god to put that sword in your hand and you take it to the heart of the enemy yes you be the one to turn that bolt you be the one to grab that instrument or whatever it is and let god pulsate through you we get set here now could god make that piano play without anybody sitting there yes absolutely you've done it before that's very prominent story brother bam tells about uh the the girl singing the great physician now is dear she's singing and raising her hands and worshiping god when the spirit of god falls and that piano just keeps playing the great position now is near he could do it absolutely could do it he could put that forward together he could do it right but he uses us he gets an instrument and he takes that instrument and sets it there with the power of god and the knowledge in his fingers to play that piano amen to play that guitar to play jesus but stand up here and and preach to all of us it takes god bringing an instrument and through us that are strong of the lord to operate the purpose that god wants planned his plan to be done in this world in our lives it takes us to do it that's why we have to be strong in the lord to have faith because it's our hands it's our feet it's our minds it's our sight it's our abilities that god does it through we talked about last week god don't put anything more on what you can do god's not going to call you to do god's not going to call you let me just do this god's not going to ask you to get something off of an eight-foot shelf if you're three foot tall amen i've seen brother roger crawl through some very small attics and under some very small crawl spaces under houses and i ask him sometimes i'm smaller let me do it but sometimes it takes the master electrician to know what he's what he wants to do when he's up there but typically god is not going to call someone who's three foot tall to get something off a nine-foot shell amen he has a nine-foot guy to do that with praise the lord now that's a very simplistic way of putting it but god has each one of us that's why we're all different god has each one of us in our place for our purpose and all of the things i've talked about last week that he can use to bring about that purpose that he has but every one of us the common denominator and every one of us has to be we have to be strong in the lord amen strong in the lord not strong in myself not strong in my abilities what i can do but strong in the lord amen sure brother pat knows how to put that forward back together he's done it over and over and over again he knows exactly how to do it but how many times have you heard him testify of places he's gotten to lord help me here yes amen because we all need him we all need him and now all need him to be and continue to be but our the stronger the lord that's our part god's done his part the strong of the lord's my part amen i'm going to have to put on that whole armor one scripture i'm going to close psalms 18 29. psalms 18 29. says for by thee i have run through a truth and by my god have i leaked over a wall amen praise the lord could god use a three-foot purse to get something off a 9-foot shelf sure he could normally he doesn't but he could but i think we've understood the fact god can do whatever he wants right amen god could take a person with no fingers and play a piano or a guitar if he wants to because god can do whatever he wants it's up to him amen but typically in the operation of the lord and what god does for us he puts us in positions that he knows that we'll be able to do that god working through us and being strong in him are going to be able to accomplish what he put before us to do amen run through a wall but run through a troop jump over how many times you hear brother green talk about it say that phrase feel like i could run through a troop and jump over a wall why because the lord's with me amen yes the lord's with us yes what else matters if he's with me what else matters praise the lord faith strength and strength in the lord let's stand if we could being strong in him strong in his word strong in faith strong in the belief that god is always with us yes and as he has done so many times so will he do again amen praise the lord jesus i believe it was something that the lord helped me with because i honestly i wasn't just saying that when i started this i was honest to myself i thought what what does it really mean to be strong in the lord because that's what he asked us he said finally brother be strong in the lord well how do we know to do something if we don't know how to do it right how do you how can you do something you don't know how to do it or what's the point where he's going god's got as strong in him because he has a purpose that he wants to accomplish that strength in the lord jesus amen let's sing this song to him amen i'll start with the with the chorus here amen i don't know if anybody knows it we've got the power anybody ever sing that song before you sing it a lot in north carolina

ever get strong enough if we don't ever use amen stand upon god's word and believe the promises of that word and take it to the heart of the enemy god will bring it to pass every time ask anything in my name and i will do it he said praise the lord he's given us that we have that in the name of the lord jesus be strong in the lord and of a good courage be strong in the lord and the power of his
