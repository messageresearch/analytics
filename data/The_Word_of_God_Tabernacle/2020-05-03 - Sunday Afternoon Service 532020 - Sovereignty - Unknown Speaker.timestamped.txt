[6:55] Lord even in this world God hopefully

[7:00] thinking this morning how much is missed
[7:03] because we're not able to get together
[7:05] just not the same Lord preach it to a
[7:07] computer or to a camera Lord and having
[7:10] the people there in the Fellowship and
[7:13] Lord just love those people so dearly
[7:15] God just bless it now we just commit it
[7:17] to you Lord and ask your blessings upon
[7:19] it may you speak through me I pray God
[7:21] we just commit ourselves to you this
[7:24] congregation in the name of the Lord
[7:25] Jesus Christ
[7:28] amen thank you god bless you again
[7:32] appreciate each one's comments and
[7:34] questions and thoughts and looking at
[7:37] the midweek there was a a concern Airi a
[7:42] question that was posed to me this week
[7:45] about the midweek service that I had put
[7:49] online that was a little bit long I
[7:51] apologize for that
[7:52] but it was a question about it and I
[7:55] wanted to clarify that to everyone
[7:57] that's watching or anybody else that
[7:58] might see this that when I talked about
[8:01] the the earth of the the States the
[8:06] United States being burned over a border
[8:08] border coast to coast and and the
[8:09] prophecy that we know this is going to
[8:11] be fulfilled this country I was when I
[8:16] was referring to whether the bride was
[8:17] going to be here or not I was I was I
[8:19] was actually being facetious and
[8:21] somebody asked me about that because I
[8:23] know brother madam said that before one
[8:26] bomb Falls or fire falls whatever that
[8:28] the bride is going to be gone I know
[8:30] that I guess I was just unfortunately
[8:33] and I went back and watched it and I can
[8:35] see where the person would feel that way
[8:36] but I unfortunately was probably making
[8:40] light too much of the the people and
[8:43] hopefully understood I was talking about
[8:45] and trying to get the point across that
[8:47] that people try to mold modern events to
[8:51] fit prophecies and that's not the way
[8:54] it's supposed to be the modern events
[8:57] are made clear by the prophecy and not
[8:59] the other way around and I guess I was
[9:01] making light of that thinking how
[9:03] obvious it is that the bride shorter the
[9:06] bride's going to be gone before that
[9:08] happens because it's gonna burn this
[9:10] country completely over so I was being
[9:11] facetious I apologize I can see if
[9:14] somebody's watching it where you got the
[9:15] wrong idea about that and I apologize
[9:17] for that
[9:18] we know absolutely that the bride's
[9:20] gonna be gone before all those things
[9:22] take place and that's one reason not to
[9:24] still believe that the bride is going to
[9:27] be gone even before California sings
[9:28] that's just my opinion in brother Graham
[9:31] doesn't say
[9:32] that but but anyway the calamity and all
[9:37] that's going to ensue in that but we're
[9:40] just thankful that the Lord help us to
[9:42] be ready that's the other point I want
[9:44] to make make sure that we're ready
[9:45] regardless because even if the rapture
[9:48] is not for 10 years he may come and get
[9:50] me today so it's not going to matter to
[9:52] me when the rapture is it becomes
[9:54] against me today what's going to matter
[9:55] to me is how I'm with the Lord right now
[9:57] today and that's what matters and that's
[10:00] what matters to you that's what matters
[10:01] to all of us so that's the most
[10:03] important thing you get that right in
[10:05] your heart and all is well amen but I
[10:07] want to go into the scripture now and
[10:09] get to our subject for this Sunday and
[10:12] again I pray and trust to be a blessing
[10:13] to you again I said it was a thought
[10:16] that I had had to give doing the midweek
[10:19] but it really got a little more involved
[10:22] and longer than I was expecting so I
[10:25] wanted to make it on the Sunday so we'll
[10:27] just do this today so let's go over to
[10:29] Colossians and look at Colossians
[10:32] chapter 1 we're gonna read three verses
[10:35] of Scripture beginning with the
[10:36] fifteenth first so Colossians chapter 15
[10:41] I guess maybe when I had the chance I
[10:45] should have got both bifocals on I could
[10:47] actually bring this and this at the same
[10:48] time but you bear with me okay
[10:51] Amen Colossians chapter 1 begin with
[10:54] verse 15 amen verse 15 who is the image
[10:58] of the invisible God the firstborn of
[11:02] every creature firstborn of every
[11:05] creature think about that the image of
[11:08] the invisible God well one know who that
[11:11] is that's Jesus the image is the
[11:13] expression Jesus was the full expression
[11:17] in bodily form of the of the invisible
[11:21] God and he was the firstborn of every
[11:25] creature
[11:26] he said well Jesus didn't come till four
[11:28] thousand years after creation how could
[11:30] that be well it tells us this wasn't
[11:33] just a man it wasn't the second person
[11:36] in the Godhead
[11:37] this was God Almighty coming in flesh
[11:40] veiling himself to his people so that
[11:43] only those that could see by revelation
[11:45] would know who he was and he still hides
[11:48] himself in the same way he hides himself
[11:51] in the middle of all the trinitarianism
[11:54] and the second person in God heads and
[11:56] things he's still Jesus Christ he still
[11:59] got almighty he's the one in the same he
[12:02] is the expression the image of the
[12:05] invisible God the firstborn of every
[12:08] creature for by him by him Jesus
[12:13] God same one in the same so you can't
[12:17] separate them we're all the were all
[12:20] things created that are in heaven and
[12:22] that are in earth visible and invisible
[12:25] whether this ever thought of that
[12:27] he's the creation he's the creator of
[12:29] all the things it's visible but the
[12:31] Bible tells us he's the creator of all
[12:33] things that we can't even see any jewels
[12:36] and everything else anything is
[12:37] invisible he created that as well
[12:40] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[12:43] principalities or powers all things were
[12:47] created by him and for him all things
[12:52] visible and invisible were created by
[12:55] him and for him sorry I'm already
[12:58] starting to move our name but all still
[13:01] oh I'm sorry I get a little excited is
[13:03] the reading the scripture the maintance
[13:06] Prince about all things were created by
[13:09] him and for him that's now keep that in
[13:11] mind because that's the one of the most
[13:13] powerful statements here that we want to
[13:15] get to our topic and 17th verse and he
[13:18] is before all things there we go first
[13:21] born very picture and by him all things
[13:24] consist
[13:26] or stand all things to this day still
[13:29] stand or consist of what they are from
[13:32] the beginning of creation when God said
[13:35] let there be when God said let there be
[13:37] it created and
[13:39] created by him and for him and even to
[13:42] this day what he said still stands what
[13:46] he said still is consistent it consists
[13:51] of the moon rising the Sun coming up the
[13:55] trees the grass the birds the animals
[13:58] humans everything consists it continues
[14:01] it still stands today not you know as as
[14:05] God created it and of course it's
[14:08] evolved and changed because of man being
[14:11] on the earth man has changed the way
[14:15] they do things because they had a higher
[14:16] intellect but of course the birds they
[14:19] still harvest and build nests and do
[14:21] everything they did and the animals and
[14:23] botany life and animal life all do
[14:25] exactly consisting zactly the way God
[14:27] created it to be but the point is he
[14:30] created it he created it it was all
[14:32] created by him and for him next like to
[14:38] sit you know people don't believe you
[14:42] God say okay well you just you you make
[14:44] your own grass then you say well we'll
[14:46] take some of this dirt no no no no you
[14:48] can't you can't take the dirt that God
[14:50] has already created create your own dirt
[14:53] create your own see build your own blade
[14:56] of grass see but God did that and you
[14:59] can't people can deny it all they want
[15:01] but the fact is it still consists it's
[15:04] still the same as still here and I want
[15:07] to take that and talk about the
[15:09] sovereignty of God because the
[15:12] sovereignty of God has become so Misun
[15:14] well becoming has been still is so
[15:17] misunderstood by people the sovereignty
[15:20] of God is something that comes to us by
[15:23] revelation a revelation is something
[15:27] that God reveals to you and reveals to
[15:30] his own and he doesn't just reveal it to
[15:32] anybody or everybody
[15:33] he only reveals it to his chosen
[15:36] those who will see it with those who see
[15:38] it they understand that God is sovereign
[15:40] right here it tells us everything was
[15:43] built by him and for Nia and people
[15:46] think they have a better way of doing it
[15:48] people think they have a better way that
[15:49] it should be people think that it should
[15:51] be done this way or you know I have a
[15:53] better idea about this no you don't but
[15:56] people think that they don't understand
[15:59] why certain things happen the way they
[16:02] do in the world and and because of their
[16:04] intellect you know brother Branham even
[16:06] said man would get too smart man will
[16:09] get smarter too smart for their own good
[16:13] to the point that they would even
[16:15] destroy themselves and we see that we're
[16:17] getting to that place people are dying
[16:20] by the hundreds by the thousands because
[16:23] of man and see as man is destroying
[16:26] themselves it becomes so intelligent
[16:28] they think that they have a better idea
[16:30] they have a better way of doing it that
[16:33] God did it but we understand the God's
[16:36] chosen understand by revelation that's
[16:39] why sovereignty is a revelation to
[16:41] understand God is sovereign it was
[16:43] created by him you know what you
[16:45] scientists you think you have a better
[16:47] idea than God you've got to create your
[16:49] own earth and then you can be sovereign
[16:51] over your on earth you can solve it you
[16:54] can do whatever you want and that little
[16:56] world of creation that you create then
[16:58] you can be sovereign you can do it the
[17:00] way you want to do it I didn't want to
[17:02] do it and everything you could do it
[17:04] that way now that's the way they've
[17:05] created treated this Satan's Eden they
[17:08] treated this Satan's eating this won't
[17:10] cause loss like we talked about last
[17:12] week they treated it the way they wanted
[17:14] to they've treated it and and changed
[17:17] and manipulated it and made it to work
[17:19] it fits what they think you wanted they
[17:22] want it to be but if you want to have a
[17:23] better idea than God you think you're
[17:25] more important to better than God then
[17:26] you go create your own world but this
[17:28] world was created by him and for him and
[17:32] he is sovereign in it he is sovereign
[17:36] what is sovereign sovereign is a supreme
[17:39] ruler or the ultimate there's got to be
[17:42] an ultimate in everything and God is the
[17:45] ultimate by revelation and we realize
[17:48] that sovereignty is a revelation and
[17:51] without a revelation you're not going to
[17:53] understand the sovereignty of God is
[17:54] going to think well why did this happen
[17:56] like this or why did these people get
[17:58] this and these didn't I mean just think
[18:01] about the things that people don't
[18:03] understand today how many times you've
[18:05] watched on the news that a storm come
[18:08] through a city tornado or something and
[18:10] and you're looking one house is
[18:12] completely nothing but toothpicks after
[18:15] the tornado rips through that city and
[18:17] the house right next door to it is
[18:19] standing almost perfectly it's like it
[18:22] wasn't even touched not even almost not
[18:24] even like a storm came through but one
[18:27] hand you got one this toothpicks on the
[18:30] other hand you got one that's hardly
[18:32] even touched well I can't explain that I
[18:36] can't begin to understand what that
[18:39] happens people think it would just think
[18:41] about the cruelty virus today thousands
[18:45] tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
[18:47] of people may be contracted comes into
[18:50] terms into kovat 19 as they call it but
[18:53] a lot of people contract it well some
[18:55] people don't even show any symptoms at
[18:58] all some people that you wouldn't even
[19:00] know that they even have anything and
[19:02] then the pressure right next to a dies
[19:04] from I explained that you can't explain
[19:09] that it's no ALC it's a bug and it's
[19:12] above my pay grade
[19:14] as this thing goes it's a problem it's
[19:17] above our intellectual conception to
[19:19] understand why God does those things but
[19:21] you know there's things that happen in
[19:22] the world that it's not for us to
[19:24] understand it's not for us to be able to
[19:28] prove or figure out or or scientifically
[19:31] prove it's not for us to do that we just
[19:35] believe in trust in the sovereignty of
[19:37] God by
[19:38] that God has everything under control
[19:40] and he is the supreme ruler
[19:43] he is the supreme authority he is the
[19:48] ultimate just like if you got a ballgame
[19:52] umpire is is the he is the sovereignty
[19:56] of that game if he calls a ball it's a
[19:59] ball I don't care what the picture says
[20:02] I don't care what the pictures coach
[20:04] says sort of the team may come and run
[20:06] all the field doesn't matter according
[20:09] to the officials of the book of the
[20:11] rules of that game that upset a ball
[20:14] it's a ball period there's no
[20:17] interpretation there's no changing it it
[20:19] is a ball he can change his mind
[20:22] but my point is nobody else can change
[20:26] it from a ball to a strike because he is
[20:28] the ultimate he is the sovereign one of
[20:32] that game the judge is that way but now
[20:35] let's get back to to the the perspective
[20:39] of Christianity and and godly living and
[20:42] and in the world the things that go on
[20:45] in the world the things that go on in
[20:48] the world we see that because God is
[20:51] sovereignty sovereign his sovereignty
[20:54] that God is all-powerful God is
[20:58] all-knowing God is omnipotent God is
[21:01] omnipresent God is unchanging God is
[21:06] immutable
[21:07] he's the almighty all-powerful God well
[21:12] because he is that that allowed him to
[21:15] be the creator of this world by him for
[21:21] him he is all-powerful unchanging and
[21:26] because God is sovereign some people
[21:30] don't understand
[21:31] who without a revelation that God does
[21:35] things wrong you've probably heard the
[21:38] story brother Branham talks about a man
[21:41] really killing scoffing about God saying
[21:44] how could God fold his hands over his
[21:47] tummy and and watch those young children
[21:50] mauled to death by lions and ripped in
[21:53] half during the dark ages how could a
[21:55] God set back silent and let all this
[21:58] happen busy and people do the same thing
[22:01] today why can there be a Shriner's why
[22:05] can there be a children's hospitals why
[22:07] could there be P young children dying of
[22:10] cancer because this is first of all like
[22:13] we said this is not our world this is
[22:16] not our cosmos we're creatures of a
[22:19] different place
[22:20] we're Pilgrims and strangers here but
[22:24] it's not ours to understand it's not
[22:26] urges to say well that was unfair well
[22:29] who said it was unfair me what made it
[22:32] unfair my standard God's standard what
[22:35] made it unfair see this is this is we
[22:40] live in God's world he is the one that
[22:42] saw bird God doesn't break the rules
[22:45] God is perfect God is righteous and God
[22:49] is just every decision he makes he makes
[22:53] with with with an attitude err it's hard
[22:58] to use words outside of our human
[23:00] vernacular but he takes the thought
[23:03] process or the attitude that that
[23:05] everything in his mind from now through
[23:09] eternity is perfect as he as he calls it
[23:14] he can't make a mistake
[23:15] God can't have a better thought man does
[23:19] they say they do anyway sometimes I
[23:21] think a lot of the thoughts that come
[23:22] out to seem to be better aren't
[23:24] necessarily better but
[23:26] man does these things change and evolve
[23:33] humanity does but God doesn't so even in
[23:37] God's sovereignty in his almighty
[23:39] all-powerful all-knowing omnipotent
[23:42] unchanging immutable
[23:44] he's just that's why we can trust him
[23:48] because he's just and whatever he does
[23:50] say well when he when he took mine on my
[23:55] wife's son after 36 and a half hours how
[23:57] is that just I I can't figure that out
[24:00] but I do know that my life is in the
[24:03] hands of someone that's far greater than
[24:06] I am I know that my life is in the hands
[24:09] of someone that knows way better than I
[24:11] do
[24:12] his ways are far beyond my ways his
[24:14] thoughts way beyond my thoughts or how
[24:16] could I even begin to pursue to tell God
[24:19] a better way of doing it God created the
[24:22] elephant god created the mouse God
[24:24] created the eagle and God created the
[24:26] hummingbird that's his choice he created
[24:28] the big blue whale and he created the
[24:30] plankton it's his choice the big blue
[24:34] whale eats the plankton the plankton
[24:35] says why can't I be a big blue whale
[24:37] because they've got that make you that
[24:38] way so we all have our purpose to serve
[24:41] but God is the one that is sovereign in
[24:45] adjusting and calling everything as it
[24:48] is in the religious world in the
[24:52] religious world
[24:54] no offense now but in the religious
[24:56] world Catholics believe the Pope is
[24:58] solvent Catholics believe that the Pope
[25:02] is their sovereign deity he is their
[25:04] sovereign ruler whatever the Pope says
[25:07] that's what happens whatever the Pope's
[25:10] opinion is that's what they go by they
[25:13] they change it right and you edict right
[25:16] on you something differents variance
[25:18] from what it used to be and if he says
[25:20] that
[25:21] that's what they live by that's what
[25:23] they go by that's their that's their
[25:25] ultimate that's that's their
[25:27] sovereignties
[25:28] is in that one man when that man dies
[25:31] they put it on in this place and the
[25:33] same thing happens all over again but
[25:36] see we don't put our sovereignty our
[25:38] trust of sovereignty in a man we put our
[25:41] trust of our sovereignty in the Lord
[25:43] Jesus in God and the one who created
[25:45] this you want to ambassador of God on
[25:49] this planet look at those who God has
[25:51] put his spirit in God has put his spirit
[25:55] in those become his ambassadors because
[25:58] they are chosen by him not by man they
[26:02] didn't throw rocks or they didn't add
[26:04] icer or as he did in the Bible but but
[26:11] is God chosen and when God chooses God
[26:14] chooses right and when God chooses right
[26:16] it manifests itself the way it's
[26:18] supposed to I can't explain why one
[26:21] house is destroyed the other one isn't
[26:23] I can't just I can't tell you why one
[26:25] gets a disease doesn't touch him doesn't
[26:28] even hardly affect him at all and the
[26:29] other one dies from it I I can tell you
[26:33] why the things of the Dark Ages and all
[26:35] that derma week had to go on the ground
[26:37] and die so it can come back again
[26:38] but the understanding people say well
[26:41] they don't want to follow what God
[26:42] because of this that and the other well
[26:44] if you want to follow someone something
[26:47] that is unchangeable that doesn't change
[26:50] that is always the same that doesn't die
[26:53] today and come back tomorrow or someone
[26:57] that's unjust or makes a decision about
[26:59] one thing one way this time and another
[27:01] thing about this same thing another time
[27:03] or shows favoritism to this person or
[27:05] that family or something
[27:07] you want somebody you can serve that you
[27:08] can depend on to be immutable unchanging
[27:11] just and faithful and righteous and true
[27:14] that's Jesus Christ the only one that
[27:17] there is let's go to Roman's
[27:19] and my goodness I think I've already ate
[27:23] up my 20 minute myth we
[27:24] now enrollments
[27:27] there's Cub chapter nine Romans chapter
[27:31] nine let's begin with verse 10 it's very
[27:33] familiar scripture reading a lot of
[27:35] people go to it because it's a scripture
[27:37] a lot of people don't understand and I
[27:40] think some people make out of this
[27:42] scripture really things that don't
[27:45] pertain in this scripture but anyway
[27:46] we'll just I might get into that just
[27:49] but let's start with verse 10 Romans
[27:52] chapter 9 verse 10 and not only this but
[27:56] when Rebecca also had conceived by one
[27:59] even by our Father Isaac for the
[28:02] children being not yet born neither
[28:04] having done any good or evil that the
[28:06] purpose of God according to election my
[28:10] extent so whose purpose is this for it's
[28:13] not for Rebecca's it's not for Isaacs
[28:16] his not for Jacob or Esau is not for
[28:21] mine is not for yours
[28:22] not for brother branham's is for gods
[28:25] it's God's purpose
[28:28] far be it for me to try to say that he
[28:33] should have done it different but it was
[28:35] God's purpose that this is done by by
[28:38] God through for God's purpose according
[28:42] to election that the predestination of
[28:46] God the election of God now if you watch
[28:50] this and you don't understand that you
[28:53] have to know that God is all-knowing God
[28:56] knew as we put in our human language the
[29:00] beginning from the end
[29:01] now the to God there is no beginning
[29:03] audience because he's Elohim the self
[29:05] existing never had a beginning or ending
[29:07] but in our word God knew everything
[29:10] beginning to the end so if God knew that
[29:13] then he knew who would and who would not
[29:15] based on the free will that he put in
[29:19] every one of our lives we all have a
[29:20] choice we all have a decision to make in
[29:24] our lives which way we're gonna go who
[29:26] we're gonna choose we're gonna I'm gonna
[29:28] serve the Lord we're gonna serve a big
[29:31] fat guy statue anyway so others but what
[29:38] are we gonna choose what's our decision
[29:39] being agnostic atheist course I don't
[29:42] even believe in atheists sounds ironic
[29:44] doesn't it but don't believe it
[29:46] atheists don't exist because everybody
[29:50] has a God everybody has something that
[29:52] they serve but God's election God's
[29:56] predestination because God knew he could
[30:00] predestinate he could choose his
[30:03] election stood is not of works but as
[30:07] him they call it so it's nothing to
[30:08] either when I'm done is it's not the
[30:11] works that either one of them performed
[30:13] it's not any good deed that anyone could
[30:16] have done of course neither one was even
[30:17] born yet neither and because neither one
[30:20] was even born
[30:21] it had to be of God who called it so
[30:25] God's the one that calls in his
[30:27] sovereignty
[30:28] God chose
[30:30] God decided now he didn't decide just
[30:33] based on well some crazy stuff like we
[30:36] do as humans he basted his decisions
[30:39] based on what he knows what his
[30:42] foreknowledge tells him he knew that
[30:45] Esau was gonna sell his birthright
[30:47] he knew that he saw wasn't gonna value
[30:49] the birthright that he that God had
[30:51] given him he knew that he was going to
[30:53] just sell it out for a mess of pottage
[30:54] II did not mean anything to him and he
[30:57] knew that Jacob was gonna want it so
[30:59] badly and it was gonna mean so much to
[31:01] him that he was even gonna deny even de
[31:04] c.v sought to get it he knew that and
[31:07] because of the desired the man's heart
[31:10] do you think about David looking at
[31:12] Bathsheba David said I'll not put a
[31:14] wicked thing before my eye and then he
[31:15] looks across he sees best Sheba and what
[31:17] happens but God called David a man after
[31:20] his own heart
[31:21] why not because of the act not because
[31:23] of the thing with Bathsheba but because
[31:25] of the man's heart but because of the
[31:28] the men he was a man after his own heart
[31:30] because of his heart he looked into the
[31:33] man's heart and saw what that man really
[31:35] consisted of what he really was it
[31:37] wasn't works but it's God's election
[31:40] God's choosing and in Jacob's heart he
[31:44] desired that birthright it meant more to
[31:47] him than it did Esau and that's why God
[31:49] loved Esau loved Jacob 12 first it was
[31:54] said unto her the elder shall serve the
[31:56] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[31:59] loved but Esau have I hated before
[32:02] either boy was born now people think
[32:05] that's unrighteous Oh God is sovereign
[32:08] he does what he wants you want to tell
[32:10] him something better you want to tell
[32:12] him he should have made the mouse a big
[32:13] old fat gray thing and the elephant a
[32:15] little B no that's his choice he decides
[32:18] what to do and he's righteous in doing
[32:21] it he's righteous than doing it
[32:23] it's amazing today how little
[32:25] accountability people take for their own
[32:27] lives our own actions and decisions and
[32:29] things they say it
[32:30] do it's it's incredible how little
[32:33] responsibility people have it seems like
[32:36] in the world today about the things they
[32:39] do there's no accountability it bleeds
[32:40] over into the religious world like we
[32:42] was talking about it another little
[32:43] thing people prophesy and say things are
[32:45] the one things that dot that I happened
[32:48] he didn't happen aren't even scriptural
[32:50] and then nobody calls him out nobody
[32:53] holds them responsible I'll tell you
[32:55] what is holding them responsible that's
[32:57] God global holds you responsible to
[32:59] everything you think because your
[33:02] thoughts speak before God the new you
[33:04] more powerfully before God then do your
[33:06] words so God knows and that's what
[33:09] matters the most
[33:09] so before either boy was born God said I
[33:11] love Jacob and I'm hate Esau I'm not
[33:15] gonna tell him he should have done it a
[33:16] different way that's his choice with
[33:20] with with a simple molecule he could
[33:25] just draw me off the planet I'd end up
[33:28] spinning in being in hell
[33:34] so ha I'm not going to tell them the
[33:37] better way to do it there's for me to do
[33:39] it that that's God choice what shall we
[33:43] say then is there unrighteousness with
[33:46] God god forbid for he said to Moses I
[33:50] will have mercy on who I'll have mercy
[33:52] and I will have compassion on whom I
[33:54] will have compassion amen praise the
[33:58] Lord
[33:58] that's wonderful Lord I'm thankful his
[34:02] light shine on my pathway one day and I
[34:05] said yes Lord so then it is not a him
[34:08] that willeth nor him that runneth but of
[34:10] God that showeth mercy for the scripture
[34:14] saith unto Pharaoh even for this same
[34:16] purpose have I raised thee up that I
[34:19] might show my power in thee and that my
[34:22] name might be declared throughout all
[34:24] the earth remember remember think about
[34:27] the sovereignty of God then this I've
[34:30] always wondered
[34:31] now
[34:32] you may have an answer that you've made
[34:34] up and that's fine and I have my own
[34:36] answers of things that are scripturally
[34:38] unanswerable and there's many many
[34:41] things that are unanswerable because
[34:44] we're just human so you may have your
[34:47] own answer but I've always wondered God
[34:50] called Moses and did what he did with
[34:52] Moses not go through the whole story but
[34:54] then God calls and tells Moses to go
[34:57] down and and tell Pharaoh to let his
[34:59] people go
[34:59] Moses old man beard hanging down his
[35:02] belly cricket stick with the wife on
[35:04] them going going down to Egypt to take
[35:07] over Regal Moses I'm going to take over
[35:09] Egypt the most powerful country in the
[35:12] world I'm the most powerful man Pharaoh
[35:14] gonna go take over well how do you plan
[35:17] to do that Moses I don't know God just
[35:19] told me to do it
[35:20] amen it's God song amen God told me to
[35:24] do it I'm gonna go do it but then when
[35:26] Moses goes down there what does God do
[35:28] God doesn't stick Pharaoh under a chair
[35:31] or under a desk
[35:33] God doesn't kill Pharaoh or or
[35:36] diminishes army or anything like that
[35:38] God actually hardens Pharaoh's heart
[35:41] against Moses that's incredible God
[35:47] sends a man and before he can even get
[35:51] there God makes the God makes the thing
[35:54] he's telling him to do even harder to do
[35:57] but that's God God's got a lesson God
[36:01] wanted to make sure that Moses didn't
[36:04] get any glory for this this was all God
[36:07] God can soften the heart and God can
[36:10] harden the heart
[36:11] however God wants it to go he says the
[36:14] leaders and the rulers of our country
[36:16] are his their hearts are in his hand he
[36:20] can do with them as he will because he's
[36:22] sovereign
[36:23] amen but just think about the Pharaoh
[36:26] God sent Moses and then made Moses job
[36:29] even harder than it was Wow thank you or
[36:33] whatever whatever it takes sword we're
[36:36] just gonna believe right we're gonna
[36:38] believe therefore he will have mercy on
[36:41] whom he will have mercy in whom he will
[36:43] he hardeneth that will say then unto me
[36:47] all thus he yet find fault for who hath
[36:51] resisted his will
[36:53] god help us no Lord all huh I never want
[36:56] to do that don't want to resist his will
[37:00] neighbor old man who aren't vowed that
[37:03] requires against God listen this you're
[37:07] a sinner today in your listen you think
[37:08] about this who replies against God you
[37:12] want to come against God it's not a good
[37:15] idea
[37:15] you might flourish you might do great in
[37:18] this world look your soul's gonna be a
[37:20] held accountable shall the thing formed
[37:24] say to him that formed it why has thou
[37:27] made me thus has not the the power the
[37:32] Potter God power over the clay me of the
[37:37] same lump to make one vessel unto honor
[37:39] in another vessel to dishonor isn't he
[37:44] the one that made is like I said you
[37:46] want to be soldered make your own world
[37:48] you want to be sovereign create your own
[37:51] planets create your own universe creates
[37:54] your own galaxies and then you can be
[37:56] sovereign over it don't take God's
[37:59] creation and try to be sovereign over
[38:01] God's creation God is sovereign he does
[38:04] as he will but again what he does he
[38:08] does
[38:09] justly he does right to sleep
[38:12] what if God willing to show his wrath
[38:16] and to make his power known endured with
[38:19] much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[38:22] fitted to destruction so think about if
[38:25] God made me and God did because God made
[38:29] all of us we read Colossians all things
[38:32] were created by him for him visible and
[38:34] invisible so if we're made by God so how
[38:37] can I say that if the same block God
[38:40] made one a vessel of Honor one
[38:41] investible dishonor from out of the same
[38:44] womb come the East on Jacob when he
[38:46] loved one he hated before the world boy
[38:48] was born so that the election of God
[38:50] might stand predestination who am I to
[38:55] say that I should have been that one or
[38:57] I should have been put in this position
[38:59] or I should have been given that great
[39:02] place of authority or that great bunch
[39:06] of money or or power or something Who am
[39:08] I to say that I should have been done
[39:10] this or that God made me those he made
[39:14] me the way I am he gave me the parents
[39:17] he gave me he raised me in the home he
[39:19] raised me and the neighborhood he raised
[39:21] me with the friends that I had that the
[39:23] schools that I went to and the teachers
[39:24] that I had to the wife that I got to the
[39:27] children that were born to me that the
[39:28] grandchildren to every facet of my life
[39:30] to this point and the church we have in
[39:33] you precious Saints God is sovereign and
[39:37] all of it it's all according to his plan
[39:40] it's all according to his will now Who
[39:41] am I to say well you know I deserve a
[39:44] have a church with two hundred people in
[39:46] it I don't want to church to two hundred
[39:48] people in it but if God saw fit whatever
[39:51] his will is that's what matters amen
[39:54] because wherever God sends us and
[39:56] whatever God wants us to do he he plans
[39:59] it it's according to his will
[40:02] and he gives us the grace to be able to
[40:04] do it whatever it takes God gives it to
[40:07] us whatever we need to do God is the one
[40:10] that's in charge of it so we can't say
[40:12] one is better and one is not because
[40:14] it's all up to him God is sovereign God
[40:17] is just let's go to a couple of the
[40:19] scriptures before I close visions
[40:21] chapter one maybe we'll get a little bit
[40:24] more than this predestination here the
[40:26] Fijians chapter one you know the gods
[40:28] Paul spoke to the Ephesian Church in a
[40:32] way of greater maturity level than he
[40:35] did to the Corinthians and others but
[40:38] the feasts were were more of a group
[40:41] that was more mature in God so he speaks
[40:45] to them and begins to them about
[40:47] predestination if he's one for by the
[40:52] fourth first Paul is saying according as
[40:55] he hath chosen us in him before what
[40:59] before the foundation of the world
[41:03] before God even laid this foundation out
[41:07] here that we're standing on today before
[41:08] God said let there be
[41:10] he already had established this he
[41:14] already had chosen me in you as a part
[41:17] of him because we were in him as a fall
[41:22] or attribute we were already in him as a
[41:25] part of him and Fred if you were not a
[41:28] part of him then you will not be a part
[41:31] of him now or ever but if we were that
[41:34] soft remember that thought see God God
[41:38] seeks his own counsel God doesn't seek
[41:41] counsel you go read the Bible Hebrews
[41:43] can't remember if I wrote that scripture
[41:45] down but there's no counsel that God
[41:47] does with man God doesn't count some me
[41:50] on it God doesn't say well what do you
[41:53] think no God does it period he is his
[41:57] own counselor he counseled with himself
[41:59] so I
[42:02] for me to say well you know you should
[42:07] have chosen so-and-so or you should have
[42:10] decided this that that God chose me God
[42:15] chose you so if we were that thought in
[42:18] him we were that attribute chosen before
[42:21] the foundation of the world
[42:23] a predestination chokes you then look at
[42:26] this before the foundation of the world
[42:29] God chose elected you well if you were a
[42:33] part of them then you'll be a part of
[42:34] them now you'll always be a part of
[42:36] because that part of you who he is is
[42:38] who you really are that part of God that
[42:42] God placed in these time bodies these
[42:44] human bodies do you want their you won't
[42:46] be there because as God is all-knowing
[42:49] he knew all the way again beginning to
[42:53] end that put us in him that put us in
[42:58] him God knew everybody would be gone but
[42:59] he put us in him by the understanding of
[43:03] free of foreknowledge predestined
[43:07] before the foundation world chosen in
[43:09] him before the foundation of the world
[43:11] that we should be holy and without blame
[43:14] before him in love having predestinated
[43:18] us unto the adoption of children by
[43:21] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[43:25] good pleasure of Newton's will oh no no
[43:29] the Pope's would no it doesn't brother
[43:31] branham's will no it doesn't say that
[43:33] what is it to the good pleasure of his
[43:36] will
[43:37] capital H my Bible doesn't have a
[43:39] capital H but it should be God's will
[43:41] he's a predestinated us to be adopted as
[43:47] sons and daughters of God by Jesus
[43:49] Christ to himself according
[43:52] to his good pleasure not mine not yours
[43:55] a long thankful he did so I take
[43:58] pleasure in it but it wasn't for my
[43:59] purpose wasn't for yours wasn't for my
[44:02] good pleasure let's say that wasn't for
[44:04] my good pleasure he didn't count some me
[44:06] on it he said would you like to know he
[44:09] didn't go to the others would you like
[44:11] to now when God comes into our hearts as
[44:13] we're born into this world God comes to
[44:16] every person and gives every person the
[44:18] opportunity and they decide and choose
[44:21] whether they're going to accept him as
[44:23] their Savior or not that's their choice
[44:25] God knocks on every door God knocks on
[44:29] every heart and everyone has that choice
[44:32] but God knew my predestination so that
[44:35] those who would accept he adopted into
[44:38] his family he placed them in his family
[44:42] eight men were placed in his family
[44:45] that's the purpose that God has put for
[44:47] us to serve on this earth and is for his
[44:50] good pleasure we serve at his good
[44:53] pleasure to the praise of the glory of
[44:57] His grace wherein he had made us
[45:00] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[45:04] redemption through the blood the
[45:06] forgiveness of sins according to the
[45:08] riches of His grace wherein he had
[45:11] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[45:14] prudence having made known unto us the
[45:17] mystery of his will according to this
[45:19] according to his good pleasure he
[45:22] revealed it to us according to his good
[45:24] pleasure which he had purposed in
[45:26] himself it's in him that he purposed it
[45:29] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[45:32] of times or during that time he might
[45:35] gather together in one all things in
[45:39] Christ both of which in heaven which are
[45:41] on earth even in him that goes right
[45:45] over to our Colossians reading when we
[45:47] talk about everything being
[45:49] inyoung everything was in him by him for
[45:53] him in whom also we have obtained an
[45:56] inheritance being predestinated
[45:59] according to the purpose of him who
[46:01] worketh all things after the counsel of
[46:03] his own will he worketh all things how
[46:08] after the counsel of his own will he
[46:14] didn't counsel me he counseled brother
[46:16] Anton it's gonna przemek order to but
[46:19] it's for you to get the point without it
[46:21] to understand brother Graham said Who am
[46:22] I to tell him what to do he talked about
[46:25] getting in the prayer line he said I
[46:26] could tell what God can tell god what to
[46:28] do people come up from prayer line in
[46:30] brother man it's like do y'all I do
[46:32] it but I can't tell god what to do if
[46:34] you come with this prayer line I can't
[46:36] say God kill this person
[46:37] now you better deal only you can't tell
[46:39] what to do that's his choice
[46:41] some people come up on the platform you
[46:43] got healed and some people didn't
[46:47] explain it it's not to be explained to
[46:51] be believed accepted God I understand I
[46:54] accept it maybe it was my fault
[46:57] maybe I didn't have the faith I needed
[46:59] maybe I my heart wasn't right with the
[47:02] Lord or something I don't know but but I
[47:05] do know that he has everything and
[47:07] everything is done perfect and right by
[47:08] him and and all things work after the
[47:12] counsel of his own will he only counsels
[47:15] with himself that we should be to the
[47:19] praise of the glory who first trusted in
[47:22] Christ that is who God made us that is
[47:25] who God has chosen us to be that's our
[47:28] purpose in life and it was God's choice
[47:31] to do it it wasn't our choice
[47:33] is God's way of doing it if man thinks
[47:36] he has a better way people lean on
[47:40] education people lean on medicine people
[47:43] lean on science people you know politics
[47:46] people lean on their wealth or their
[47:48] fame or their fortune their popularity
[47:51] people probably some peak church people
[47:55] lean on other things or ministers on
[47:58] their big congregation or something what
[48:00] but everybody leans on something
[48:02] everybody is like I said there's no such
[48:05] thing as an atheist everybody has a God
[48:07] there's something that everybody leans
[48:09] on something that everybody puts first
[48:12] in their lives and what they trust in
[48:14] but you take the sum total of all those
[48:17] things and add them all up and you don't
[48:20] have a drop it's like it's like a drop a
[48:24] drop of water in the Pacific Ocean to
[48:27] who God is and what God's sovereignty is
[48:30] to us it means absolutely nothing you
[48:32] take the total sum of every bit of
[48:35] science medicine politics education you
[48:38] add it all and put it in one big huge
[48:40] lump and it's not one drop out of the
[48:42] dropper indict the Pacific Ocean to who
[48:45] God is science say they have what is
[48:48] perfect they have the solution they have
[48:52] the only thing that can meet the
[48:55] challenge friend the only thing that can
[48:57] meet today's challenge is God the only
[49:00] one that can meet today's challenge it's
[49:02] not a scientist is not a doctor I'm
[49:05] thankful for what God helps him do but
[49:08] it's God God's you're the one that can
[49:10] meet this challenge and he meets that
[49:12] challenge in our lives individually
[49:14] every day
[49:16] that's the only way that we're able to
[49:17] do it it's the only thing that gets us
[49:20] there things that science said a hundred
[49:22] years ago was foolproof
[49:24] is is old news today scientists
[49:28] themselves will tell you that it's
[49:30] always constantly going from one place
[49:32] to the next or opening this door or
[49:35] something changing over here and
[49:37] building a new instrument or a new
[49:40] gadget to to do something that wouldn't
[49:44] do before God knew all that God created
[49:48] it God created six gods God is the best
[49:51] scientist ever been because not jaded
[49:53] the science dogs the best doctors ever
[49:56] been because God created the body he
[49:58] knows how it was made he knows
[50:01] everything about it he's the one who
[50:03] created it oh praise the Lord I'm
[50:07] thankful that even if we look at God as
[50:10] being that sovereign God remember that
[50:13] sovereignties by revelation that
[50:16] sovereign God God makes a way for each
[50:18] one of us let's go to one more scripture
[50:21] in Psalms 94 I read this one more
[50:26] scripture to you will close here just in
[50:28] a moment amen sums chapter 94
[50:33] we'll begin with verse 3
[50:38] Psalms 94 and 3 look at this now
[50:44] somes 94 3 Lord even even David look at
[50:49] David thinking about this Lord how long
[50:51] shall the wicked how long shall the
[50:55] wicked triumph you thinking David even
[50:58] in himself he's thinking well he's
[51:01] looking over here and he's watching the
[51:03] wicked people the ungodly people the
[51:07] people that maybe even leading other
[51:09] people astray and he caused them wicked
[51:13] and he says how long are they going to
[51:16] prosper so apparently even in David in
[51:20] his heart and in his reasoning thinking
[51:23] God these wicked people are prospering
[51:26] so greatly these wicked people are
[51:29] leading others astray how long are they
[51:32] going to continue to prosper how about
[51:35] are they going to continue to what we
[51:37] look like it would be called be blessed
[51:40] how about Lord David even himself see
[51:45] that's God's working God does that for a
[51:49] reason you understand that God has
[51:51] ministers out there today to drop people
[51:53] into error just as good as this as much
[51:57] as he has ministers out there to draw
[51:59] people into righteousness and those
[52:03] people serve their purpose just like God
[52:06] godly people served their purpose
[52:08] just like the God called ministers
[52:11] served their purpose the man called
[52:13] minister serves their purpose
[52:17] it's nothing out that God doesn't know
[52:20] or gods not allowing gonna miles all
[52:23] this for a reason it's all for a purpose
[52:25] you can't fool and you can't drop out
[52:32] the believer all the father has given
[52:36] will come and even if someone that is
[52:39] called is where they shouldn't be they
[52:41] will be where they're supposed to be
[52:42] eventually because God's called it and
[52:45] God's calling no man-made Damas going to
[52:48] keep on because thoughts called and the
[52:51] only thing when they finally get to that
[52:53] realization they're going to be able to
[52:55] feed on is equal food is this revealed
[52:58] word of the outer that's the only thing
[53:00] they're going to be able to feed on and
[53:02] when they realize they're in the chicken
[53:05] yard they're going to get to the places
[53:06] but see even in the chicken yard that
[53:08] chicken yard is serving its purpose
[53:11] David is saying why how long Lord how
[53:15] long shall the wicked triumph obviously
[53:18] the wicked were trying and he's
[53:20] questioning why how are they being so
[53:23] blessed and prosperous how long shall
[53:28] they triumph how long shall they are and
[53:31] speak hard things and all the workers of
[53:34] iniquity boasts themselves they break in
[53:38] pieces by people Oh Lord and afflict
[53:42] done heritage they slay the widow and
[53:46] the stranger and murder the fatherless
[53:49] yet they say the Lord shall not see
[53:52] neither shall the God of Jacob regarded
[53:56] soon obviously these are wicked people
[54:00] doing wicked things
[54:03] apparently as it would look to us
[54:07] prospering as David was saying they're
[54:10] prospering in that
[54:11] how can they be prospering when they're
[54:14] doing such wicked things because God has
[54:18] a reason for everything don't you think
[54:20] for a home that God didn't create
[54:22] Lucifer a God created Lucifer can you
[54:25] not think for just a moment that in
[54:27] creating Lucifer
[54:29] he knew what Lucifer was going to become
[54:31] and do well sure he did and he created
[54:35] in any way do you not know that when
[54:38] think that when God created man and
[54:41] woman he created man and woman with
[54:43] reproductive organs in their bodies
[54:45] already even though that wasn't his
[54:47] perfect will for procreation but he did
[54:51] it anyway
[54:52] know that there would be a fall and that
[54:55] there would be a need for procreation by
[54:57] man a woman he knew that he knew the
[55:00] fall was gonna happen he knew these
[55:01] things were going to take place he
[55:04] created it because there had to be a
[55:06] purpose see if there wasn't a devil how
[55:09] would we ever be sick well if we're
[55:12] never sick you think well wonderful I
[55:14] never want to be sick who wants to be
[55:16] sick the ones that grow the virus no
[55:19] nobody wants to but if you never sick
[55:22] how do you know how good it is to be
[55:24] well how do you know God as a healer if
[55:27] you never were sick if he wasn't a fall
[55:30] in the Garden of Eden you became lost
[55:31] born in iniquity how would you ever know
[55:34] what salvation is about how would you
[55:35] know who your Savior is Jesus Christ if
[55:38] there wasn't a father
[55:41] if there wasn't an anti-type to the type
[55:44] then how could we ever realize how
[55:47] precious the type is to is how the real
[55:49] is to us there's always a counterfeit
[55:52] but if there's a counterfeit there's
[55:54] always a real because if there's not a
[55:56] real the counterfeit came off up than
[55:58] the counterfeit side see the real
[55:59] because it was the original but if
[56:03] there's an original there's a
[56:04] counterfeit but there's a counterfeit
[56:06] that this shows that the real is genuine
[56:08] and the genuine God the sovereign God is
[56:12] real in his sovereign grace in his
[56:14] sovereign mercy and his sovereign love
[56:17] he is it to who he will and how dare I
[56:21] the clay tell the potter how to make me
[56:24] how to shape me how to mold me how dare
[56:28] I'd the clay tell God you are rough when
[56:32] you did this you're wrong when you went
[56:34] there you were wrong when you've got
[56:35] this person in how could you have saved
[56:38] Paul an assault was a murder how could
[56:41] you have saved him that was a bad
[56:43] decision you just should have stuck with
[56:44] Mathias that's what the church chose the
[56:47] church chose Mathias God you should have
[56:49] just kept my pious and forget about this
[56:51] Saul character no we always think we
[56:55] have a better way of doing it don't we
[56:56] I always think we have a better idea
[56:58] always think we have the solution we
[57:01] always think we have the right way
[57:02] there's only one right way and that's
[57:04] God's Way and the only one that's going
[57:06] to know that right way is those who's in
[57:08] tune and connected with him those who
[57:10] have his spirit and those who are
[57:12] connected to him we can't figure some of
[57:15] these things out I'll probably never and
[57:17] not that I need to or want to figure out
[57:20] why the Lord took our son three
[57:23] within a day and a half and many
[57:26] tragedies things that we consider
[57:27] tragedies on this earth but it's like I
[57:30] told you a few weeks ago and I think one
[57:33] of the mid weeks you know we shudder
[57:36] when little children might have problems
[57:37] or die or something like that but you
[57:39] know those little children go into the
[57:41] presence of the Lord they're going to be
[57:43] there those children go to heaven so
[57:48] would it would it been better that they
[57:52] grow up and become a drug dealer or
[57:55] something than to be with the Lord not
[57:58] saying that would have been a drug
[57:59] dealer but you understand see the
[58:01] sovereignty of God why does God do it we
[58:05] may never understand a lot of the things
[58:07] and purposes a reason why God does
[58:10] things you know there's a little song
[58:12] that says we'll understand it better by
[58:14] and by maybe we will maybe we won't I
[58:16] think if we decide to or want to we
[58:18] might could I think we get on the other
[58:21] side we're probably just not gonna care
[58:22] we're just gonna be thankful to be there
[58:25] be there with one another be there with
[58:27] our loved ones family be there with the
[58:29] Lord Jesus the one who saved me by His
[58:32] grace I think that's gonna be the main
[58:34] theme of our hearts and lives at that
[58:37] point when we get to that place God is
[58:41] sovereign friend anybody tries to come
[58:43] with some scientific proof or education
[58:46] medicine or something to say that
[58:47] they're better they're more important or
[58:48] they got a better father a better way of
[58:50] doing it they're a liar only God he's
[58:54] sovereign he created this place is
[58:56] created by him and for him and we're
[58:58] here for his purpose we're here to do
[59:01] his will not ours be led by his spirit
[59:04] not our purpose or not our fault amen
[59:07] I'm thankful and I'm thankful he is I'm
[59:10] thankful he is sovereign
[59:12] I'm thankful he does make the decision
[59:14] and he does make it the way he wants it
[59:16] to be according to his good pleasure
[59:19] because I could be really lost if he
[59:21] didn't sometimes it's hard sometimes
[59:25] it's not easy sometimes it grates the
[59:27] flesh so hard you think Lord how when
[59:30] but God has a way God has a purpose if
[59:35] you've ever been through one of those
[59:36] you know what it is you've come through
[59:38] it and we've come out better on the
[59:41] other side God just does what he tries
[59:43] to do to keep us close to him to keep us
[59:47] more like him so thanks let me implore
[59:50] you again let's not let this separation
[59:53] be a permanent thing let it not be
[59:56] something that grips us to become more
[59:59] lazy but more a student and thinking of
[1:00:05] how wonderful it's going to be when we
[1:00:07] get back together again and were more in
[1:00:09] fellowship again with one another and
[1:00:11] back in church and I can look at your
[1:00:13] beautiful faces ministering and hear the
[1:00:15] amens and the hands raising and all the
[1:00:18] great things and fellowship afterwards
[1:00:20] and I'd love to have a meal next Sunday
[1:00:23] for Mother's Day but you know there's a
[1:00:26] reason for also but just keep that on
[1:00:29] your heart continue to read your Bible
