[40:44] of a a thingle for the opportunity to
[40:46] witness just a couple of my friends have
[40:48] started asking me questions out of the
[40:50] blue about like God
[40:53] and like related to fires and how God
[40:57] certain things happen and it's really
[40:58] open doors for me to
[41:01] explain God and thankfulness and how God
[41:04] operates and God's not a person he's not
[41:06] just going to stand there and lick his
[41:08] thingers and put a fire out he uses
[41:11] people and other various questions about
[41:14] hell and heaven and I've explained
[41:17] things like the great white and judgment
[41:20] all kinds of various things so doors are
[41:23] opening for some reason so thankful for
[41:25] that opportunity praise the Lord
[41:26] wonderful
[41:28] he doesn't know but I pray for him all
[41:29] the time that his friends will see Jesus
[41:32] in him amen amen that's my prayer that
[41:36] to me his testimony is a result of the
[41:38] prayers I've been praying so praise the
[41:41] Lord
[41:43] amen God knows God is mindful amen
[41:47] praise the Lord Jesus amen let's go
[41:50] ahead and stand then if you will and
[41:52] we'll turn in the scripture over to
[41:53] Psalms chapter 51
[41:58] I've been feeling for actually quite
[42:01] some time
[42:02] now uh to bring this
[42:05] series uh it was one of the first things
[42:08] that the Lord had put on my heart when
[42:10] we started the church years ago and
[42:13] um I I was kind of wavering about it a
[42:17] little bit to go back again and then I
[42:21] then I
[42:22] remembered no one in here except for my
[42:25] wife and Dennis this morning uh was here
[42:29] when we went through this series but
[42:31] then I went to Brother Rogers the other
[42:33] night uh when he was having those
[42:34] meetings and he hit this subject very uh
[42:39] very hard and so I thought well I felt
[42:42] Lord that was a confirmation uh to me
[42:46] amen and then uh you know even even when
[42:49] you get that you still waver I do
[42:52] sometimes waver a little bit as to
[42:54] whether you should do it or not and then
[42:55] the Lord uh gave me a song uh I forgot
[42:59] who sang it but I thought well Lord I'm
[43:01] just that that solidified it for me amen
[43:05] I was going to start last week uh with
[43:08] part one on this and then the lord gave
[43:11] me that other thought that we did speak
[43:12] on and then when Micah sang that song
[43:15] that he sang it just everything just
[43:18] felt so perfectly in place things it's
[43:20] just hard for me to describe but this
[43:21] just God is just wonderful amen he's
[43:24] just so good and I trust him fully
[43:27] completely Psalms 51 now amen we're just
[43:30] going to read one verse of scripture but
[43:31] before we do can we just bow our heads
[43:33] for another word of prayer Lord Jesus
[43:36] father God we're so thankful of the
[43:38] words that were spoken the songs that
[43:40] were sang the testimonies that were
[43:42] given the worship Lord but God most of
[43:45] most of of of anything Lord we're so
[43:48] thankful God to F your spirit and know
[43:50] that you're here once again with us
[43:52] thank you Lord for the blessings that
[43:54] you give father so far in this time and
[43:57] and pray Lord that all of our worship
[43:59] father was a sweet smelling savior to
[44:01] you God may you just continue to bless
[44:03] and strengthen us move Upon Us in a
[44:06] special Supernatural way father for
[44:08] without you all of this would be in vain
[44:11] all of this will mean nothing Lord this
[44:13] will just be dead letters just words on
[44:15] a page just words that we speak but Lord
[44:18] if you come and anoint it Lord and
[44:20] anoint our ears to receive it that you
[44:22] reveal to us and help us to see in here
[44:25] what you would have us to know God then
[44:27] will be worth through eternity God the
[44:30] the reverberation of what is done here
[44:32] today will continue on Lord bless again
[44:35] those that are here those may be
[44:37] streaming Lord we're just thankful God
[44:39] for all most of all we're thankful for
[44:42] you yes we pray Lord once again you
[44:44] would anoint these lips Lord to speak
[44:47] only what you'd have to be said Lord
[44:49] anoint our ears to receive that that
[44:51] you'd have to be received and accomplish
[44:53] in here this place today what you set
[44:56] this service forth for God for this is
[44:59] your house this is your time God we're
[45:01] just here as Servants of you lord lord
[45:04] we just pray giving it all to you Lord
[45:06] that you would bless it now in the
[45:08] precious holy lovely name of our Lord
[45:10] and Savior Jesus Christ again we pray
[45:12] amen amen amen Psalms 51 one verse of
[45:16] scripture verse 5 and we'll let you be
[45:20] seated amen uh there's a lot more goes
[45:23] into this but I just want to read verse
[45:25] five to get the context now behold David
[45:27] says Now Behold I was shapen in iniquity
[45:31] and in sin did my mother conceive me you
[45:34] can be seated if you like many times
[45:36] we've heard that uh that scripture
[45:39] phrased as born in in born in sin shap
[45:42] iniquity come the world speaking lies we
[45:44] say that we quote that many times this
[45:46] is the scripture reference of which it
[45:48] comes from recognizing we as just
[45:50] Mortals born in sin shaped in iniquity
[45:54] come the world speaking lies no fault of
[45:56] our own
[45:57] amen but it is fults of our own if we
[46:00] don't receive and accept what Christ has
[46:02] done for us to be redeemed back to where
[46:05] we were amen that's the that's the point
[46:08] that we look that we want to get back
[46:10] where we were in the mind of God before
[46:12] the foundation of the
[46:14] world Amen now let's go over to St John
[46:17] chapter
[46:18] 3 and uh read a few verses of scripture
[46:21] here I want to speak and start on the
[46:23] subject the topic of adoption uh today
[46:27] uh
[46:28] adoption uh this will be born again part
[46:31] one uh so some of the beginning of this
[46:34] is fairly Elementary to most of us
[46:37] hopefully it'll just be mostly bring
[46:39] back to our remembrance but
[46:41] understanding of course to uh that we
[46:43] are purchased by the blood of Jesus
[46:46] Christ and we belong to him amen amen
[46:49] amen we are a part of his body praise
[46:52] the Lord St John chapter
[46:54] 3 I just want to begin reading with the
[46:56] first first verse here uh first
[47:01] verse amen there was a man Nam uh there
[47:04] was a man of the Pharisees named
[47:05] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[47:08] came to Jesus by night and why did he
[47:11] come by night well he probably didn't
[47:13] want any of the other Pharisee buddies
[47:15] seeing him come to Jesus especially what
[47:18] he gets gets ready to tell him and said
[47:20] unto him Rabbi we know that that are
[47:23] that thou art a teacher come from God
[47:25] for no man can do these Miracles that
[47:28] thou doest except God be with him now
[47:31] that wasn't shared by every Pharisee as
[47:33] we know as we read the scripture and go
[47:35] through the Bible that wasn't shared by
[47:37] most of his Pharisee buddies but he
[47:40] obviously a man of uh of enough
[47:43] Integrity to know to go to Jesus Christ
[47:45] and say that you have to be from God
[47:48] because nobody can do what you do except
[47:50] God's with him amen amen praise the Lord
[47:53] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[47:56] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[47:58] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[48:02] God Amen now this first place we come to
[48:04] that talks about a new birth being born
[48:07] again a new birth uh not a new birth
[48:11] naturally but a new birth spiritually
[48:13] now him having a limited amount of
[48:16] spiritual understanding did not realize
[48:19] that so his whole his whole thought is
[48:22] natural so Nicodemus comes back and says
[48:24] unto him how can a man be born when he
[48:28] is old so all he's thinking is natural
[48:31] can he enter the second time into his
[48:33] mother's womb and be
[48:35] born but God but Jesus wasn't talking
[48:38] natural Jesus was talking spiritual he
[48:40] wasn't talking about a new natural birth
[48:43] he was talking about a new spiritual
[48:45] birth because why because as David said
[48:48] we were all born in sin shap iniquity
[48:51] come the world speaking lies so we all
[48:54] needed a new or rebirth a
[48:57] regeneration everyone who is born a
[48:59] woman from that time has to be bor has
[49:03] to be born again of the spirit of God
[49:06] Amen our flesh will still be the same
[49:08] we'll look the same amen our uh outward
[49:11] appearance if you will things about our
[49:13] appearance will change because of the
[49:15] way we change the way we dress and act
[49:17] and the things that we do and and what
[49:20] we wear and not wear and things like
[49:21] that but our our appearance will be the
[49:24] same but that's not what he's he's
[49:26] talking about a spiritual birth amen
[49:29] amen because the spiritual birth is what
[49:32] God is concerned with not the natural
[49:34] birth the spiritual birth amen and
[49:37] that's where that's where he do he he
[49:39] fails to understand can a man enter into
[49:41] his mother's womb the second time no
[49:43] it's a spiritual birth he's talking
[49:45] about be born again regenerated renewed
[49:49] amen so that you're a new creature in
[49:51] Christ Jesus yes Jesus answered verely
[49:54] verily I say unto thee accept a man be
[49:56] born of water and of the spirit he
[49:59] cannot enter into the kingdom of God now
[50:01] first he says unless you're born again
[50:04] you can't see the kingdom of God now
[50:06] he's telling them unless you're born
[50:08] again you cannot enter into the kingdom
[50:10] of God Amen so two two facets Jesus
[50:14] actually makes points of but that which
[50:16] is born of the flesh is flesh amen it is
[50:20] the flesh that's what it is we're born
[50:22] in the flesh we're flesh beings we're
[50:24] human beings amen we live in the flesh
[50:27] but we don't live of the flesh right and
[50:30] that which is born of the spirit is
[50:32] Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee
[50:35] ye must be born again now he didn't make
[50:38] it an option now it's not uh your choice
[50:43] you must it's a must so every human born
[50:47] of woman must be born again amen of the
[50:51] spirit as he told here as he told him of
[50:54] the water of the spirit you must be born
[50:56] borned again to be able to enter into
[50:58] the kingdom of God able words is the
[51:00] spirit it's not flesh because the flesh
[51:02] is flesh but the spirit is Spirit the
[51:05] spirit is life the flesh is death the
[51:07] spirit is life amen you must be born of
[51:11] the spirit of God so Marvel not now that
[51:14] I say you must it's a must amen anyone
[51:19] that come into this world uh uh drawing
[51:22] breath must be born again spiritually or
[51:25] you will not see you will not enter into
[51:28] the kingdom of God it's that simple Yes
[51:31] amen there's no handshake there's no
[51:34] joining Church there's no good deeds
[51:37] there's no proper life there's there's
[51:39] you can't live good enough to make it
[51:42] amen all of our righteousness the best
[51:45] Deeds that we can ever muster up the
[51:48] best things that we can ever try to
[51:50] offer to God is filthiness in his eyes
[51:54] right the Bible says our righteousness
[51:56] is is filthy rags amen so we don't
[51:59] depend on our righteousness we depend on
[52:01] his amen we depend on the righteousness
[52:04] of God who we become the righteousness
[52:09] of God he died so we could take he died
[52:12] and took our place so we could take his
[52:14] place and become the very righteousness
[52:16] of Jesus Christ therefore you must be
[52:19] born again the wind bloweth where eth
[52:22] verse now where it listes and thou
[52:24] hearest the sound thereof but c not tell
[52:28] whence it come and whether it goeth so
[52:31] is everyone that is born of the spirit
[52:35] Nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[52:38] can these things be still thinking
[52:40] natural still thinking In the Flesh amen
[52:43] how can these things
[52:45] be Jesus answered and said unto here
[52:48] thou art a master of Israel and knowest
[52:50] not these things that you must be born
[52:52] again how can you be a master how can
[52:54] you be a teacher teacher master Master
[52:56] teacher how can you be a teacher of of
[52:59] of of scripture and not know these
[53:02] things how can you be teaching people uh
[53:06] spiritual things and not know the most
[53:08] important spiritual thing that there is
[53:10] to learn and that is a new birth how can
[53:13] you do that amen of course he didn't
[53:16] know because it can't be received but by
[53:18] Revelation it has to be received by
[53:21] Revelation can't be received by the
[53:22] natural can't be received by the flesh
[53:24] can't be understood by the flesh can't
[53:26] be explained by the flesh it's got to be
[53:29] received believed by the spirit amen
[53:32] amen because the spirit is what brings
[53:33] life and the spirit is what we live by
[53:36] and the spirit is the one that reveals
[53:38] it to you so you understand that's why
[53:40] Jesus said uh I thank thee father thou H
[53:43] has hid these things from the wise and
[53:45] prudent but revealed them unto babes
[53:48] such as would learn amen so there are
[53:52] those people that will learn yes amen
[53:56] because because they receive that
[53:57] Revelation they receive God's word amen
[54:00] and those are the ones that God that god
[54:03] holds um in truth now this uh I wanted
[54:08] to read to you about
[54:11] um
[54:12] uh probably the most important thing of
[54:16] understanding
[54:17] adoption adoption is not your birth
[54:21] right being born again is absolutely you
[54:25] don't you don't don't reach your place
[54:27] of adoption or your placement in the
[54:30] body of Christ unless you've been born
[54:32] again am you have to be born again first
[54:36] but understanding that's just the
[54:38] beginning of your journey yes your new
[54:41] birth is just your beginning yes uh when
[54:44] I when I came out of my mother's womb my
[54:47] daddy wasn't there to hand me the car
[54:49] keys amen there wasn't there wasn't a an
[54:53] HR uh person from this great organ
[54:56] organization offer me a job with a pen
[54:58] and a
[54:59] contract as I'm just starting to draw
[55:02] breath amen I'm not getting car keys and
[55:05] a contract to a $100,000 year job amen I
[55:09] was I just born I just came into this
[55:13] world I got a lot of growing to do I got
[55:16] a lot of learning to do yes I got a lot
[55:18] of growing up and maturing to do before
[55:21] I could ever think about getting a
[55:23] driver's license or holding a job or
[55:26] doing anything of that type of
[55:28] importance going to school learning
[55:30] those things come because we grow amen
[55:33] as we grow we learn so as you grow as
[55:37] you're born spiritually you're just a
[55:39] babe in Christ you just started amen
[55:42] God's not going to hand you the car keys
[55:44] amen God's not going to put some great
[55:46] thing we're just born and we're just
[55:48] born in the spirit of God we're starting
[55:51] to learn we're starting to grow that's
[55:53] just the beginning the the the adoption
[55:56] the placement is is a part of that new
[55:59] birth that we that we have placed into
[56:01] the body of Christ and knowing our
[56:04] position in Christ you realize that
[56:07] knowing your position in Christ is
[56:10] really is as important uh almost as
[56:13] important anyway as your new birth amen
[56:17] knowing your position is just as
[56:19] important let me read this to you amen
[56:22] uh he said Bible teaching is usually a
[56:24] little treacherous little you know kind
[56:26] of walking out on thin ice as we call it
[56:28] but we feel maybe this point be kind of
[56:31] good to bring and that's kind of I guess
[56:32] the point that I was making before at
[56:34] this point to uh bring this subject of
[56:37] adoption a complete understanding
[56:40] positionally of what we are in Christ
[56:43] Jesus amen what position where we are in
[56:47] the body of Christ do we belong a lot of
[56:50] times people don't feel like they belong
[56:52] because they don't understand what their
[56:53] position is a lot of people put put so
[56:56] much Credence on the five-fold ministry
[56:59] which understandably uh the position
[57:03] that it holds but everybody holds its
[57:05] own position some people major on gifts
[57:08] and things that they feel like they have
[57:10] to speak in tongues or they have to have
[57:12] some kind of Prophecy or something
[57:14] that's not necessarily A your position
[57:17] our position can be something as much as
[57:19] helping somebody amen or being there for
[57:22] other people or whatever position God
[57:24] puts us in being a good witness to other
[57:27] people trying to help lost souls come to
[57:29] Christ you know there's some people that
[57:31] have a really good gift of doing that uh
[57:35] some people get a little Tongue Tied
[57:37] Amen to to try to witness to other
[57:40] people about Jesus Christ especially
[57:42] sometimes uh in the message we get to
[57:44] the place that we want to explain all
[57:46] this other stuff instead of just trying
[57:47] to help them understand Jesus
[57:50] Christ amen get them to Christ yes if we
[57:53] get people to Christ then God Christ
[57:56] does the rest amen they learn and grow
[57:58] from there and there's people that are
[58:01] very gifted at that that are very good
[58:02] about that amen but it's finding that
[58:05] position I mean how many uh go into
[58:09] thousands of them but finding your
[58:10] position knowing your position look
[58:12] completely understanding positionally
[58:14] what we are in Christ sometimes I think
[58:17] preaching it helps reach out and uh it
[58:20] grabs the soul it gets the sinner to
[58:22] come in condemnation of the word and
[58:25] receiving the word
[58:26] but teaching teaching places a man
[58:31] teaching places a person positionally
[58:35] what they are positionally in the body
[58:38] of Christ and listen to this now this is
[58:40] the most important thing and we can
[58:43] never rightly be able to have faith
[58:47] until positionally we know who we are
[58:50] amen amen now what kind of importance do
[58:54] you put on it because we understand
[58:56] understand the importance that Faith
[58:57] plays in our religion we know and
[59:00] understand the the what faith plays in
[59:02] what we believe amen how we live we know
[59:05] faith is the number that's the Paramount
[59:07] thing if it weren't for faith we
[59:09] wouldn't even believe who Jesus Christ
[59:11] is right God Almighty veiled in flesh we
[59:15] wouldn't know that unless we were had
[59:17] unless we had faith faith to believe
[59:19] amen and it just goes on and on from
[59:21] there you can't rightly you can't
[59:25] rightly you're not able able to rightly
[59:27] have faith unless you know who you are
[59:31] positionally in Christ that to me makes
[59:35] it an extremely important thing to know
[59:38] an extremely important thing to
[59:40] understand in your life to be able to
[59:42] have the faith that we have to walk the
[59:45] walk that we walk amen not just
[59:47] believing who Christ is but every step
[59:49] we take is a step of Faith amen every
[59:52] breath we draw is a breath of Faith amen
[59:55] every the the entire life that we live
[59:58] is built on the
[1:00:00] foundation amen of Faith which we went
[1:00:03] through uh the the uh statue of a
[1:00:06] perfect man what's the foundation Faith
[1:00:09] you don't have faith you can't get any
[1:00:11] of the rest of them you might have
[1:00:13] portions of them little dabblings of
[1:00:15] them you like love a person here or
[1:00:17] there have a little bit of knowledge you
[1:00:19] might be able to control yourself a
[1:00:20] little bit or something but you can't
[1:00:22] rightly have these positions until faith
[1:00:24] is in your life and how can you have
[1:00:26] rightly faith unless you know who you
[1:00:28] are amen until I know that I belong in
[1:00:32] the body of Christ until I know that I
[1:00:34] have been born again until I know that
[1:00:36] God has chosen me and I've been in the
[1:00:38] mind of God before the foundation World
[1:00:40] told I know who I am in him how can I
[1:00:44] ever have faith to believe for anything
[1:00:46] else right amen especially in my life
[1:00:50] how can I ever have rightly have faith
[1:00:52] until I know what my position who I am
[1:00:55] in that body I have to know that the new
[1:00:58] birth is just the beginning that's just
[1:01:00] the start it's not your adoption your
[1:01:02] new birth is not your adoption your new
[1:01:05] birth places you in the body puts you
[1:01:08] there but where is that placement amen
[1:01:11] that's uh that's important to understand
[1:01:13] that placement where we are now let's go
[1:01:16] over to Acts chapter 2 again uh I'm not
[1:01:21] rushing this it's going to be something
[1:01:23] we're just going to take probably some
[1:01:25] extra scripture but over some things we
[1:01:27] know
[1:01:29] Amen to lay the
[1:01:31] foundation look Acts
[1:01:35] 2 uh acts
[1:01:37] two again speaking on the new
[1:01:39] birth acts 23 uh
[1:01:43] 37 and when they heard this they were
[1:01:45] pricked in a horse this is the day of
[1:01:47] Pentecost we all know Acts 2 is the day
[1:01:49] of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down
[1:01:52] amen filled all the house where they
[1:01:53] were sitting we pray the Lord do here
[1:01:56] for us fill all the house where they
[1:01:58] were sitting Holy Spirit Come and lit
[1:02:01] upon each of them it went into each of
[1:02:05] them amen on the day of Pentecost they
[1:02:09] come knocking out the walls as they were
[1:02:12] knocking out the walls they were
[1:02:13] speaking what the other people would
[1:02:15] listen to and think as
[1:02:17] gibberish uh didn't make any sense or
[1:02:20] speaking in another person's language in
[1:02:23] a language they didn't understand and
[1:02:26] people were looking and marbling and
[1:02:28] saying what's gotten into these
[1:02:31] people uh why are these people talking
[1:02:34] like this why are these people sounding
[1:02:36] like this what has happened to them uh
[1:02:39] they must be drunk they they must have
[1:02:42] uh they must have drunk a lot of new
[1:02:44] wine they're just drunk people that's
[1:02:46] how they're acting yeah when you get the
[1:02:48] real moving of the Holy Spirit it will
[1:02:50] make you act drunk it will make you act
[1:02:53] like you are intoxicated but they
[1:02:55] thought thought they were
[1:02:57] drunk and when they heard all that Peter
[1:03:00] said they heard this they were pricked
[1:03:03] in their
[1:03:04] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[1:03:06] rest of the Apostles men and Brethren
[1:03:08] what shall we
[1:03:10] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[1:03:14] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:03:17] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:03:20] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:03:23] the Holy Ghost you shall praise the Lord
[1:03:28] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:03:30] Ghost for the promise is unto
[1:03:33] you amen
[1:03:36] amen it is unto you and to your children
[1:03:40] your posterity however far long down it
[1:03:43] goes to your children and to all that
[1:03:46] are far off so they don't have to be
[1:03:48] right then right there amen like a lot
[1:03:51] of people say the only Apostles there
[1:03:52] were with the 12 apostles Apostolic age
[1:03:55] in when the TW last 12 of the 12 passed
[1:03:59] away uh
[1:04:02] the the apostolic age was introduced by
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ and I want anybody to show
[1:04:07] me anywhere in the scripture where it
[1:04:09] stopped amen amen it didn't even the
[1:04:13] apostolic age didn't even cease when
[1:04:16] they started a denomination around it
[1:04:18] that's right amen that still didn't kill
[1:04:21] it because it was still a Remnant it was
[1:04:24] still a group that came came out of that
[1:04:27] that actually believed in the apostolic
[1:04:29] experience not denomination but
[1:04:33] experience and the apostolic experience
[1:04:36] is exactly what we just
[1:04:38] read the Holy Ghost coming down on the
[1:04:41] people amen and filling all the house
[1:04:44] and moving with the Holy Spirit as the
[1:04:47] other as the Holy Spirit gave utterance
[1:04:49] it is to them it is to their children is
[1:04:52] to those that are far off it's even as
[1:04:54] many as the Lord are God shall call now
[1:04:56] how can you put a regulation on that I
[1:05:00] know people who try but you can't
[1:05:03] because it's whoever God chooses right
[1:05:07] it's whoever God wants it's not up to me
[1:05:11] it's not up to you it's not up to
[1:05:13] anybody any church any preacher nobody
[1:05:15] can say if you don't join this church if
[1:05:17] you don't come to ours if you don't
[1:05:18] believe this if you don't see it the way
[1:05:20] we do no it is many as God calls yes
[1:05:25] amen not not a pastor not a church not a
[1:05:28] denomination I don't care if you say
[1:05:30] I've been in the message 50 years I
[1:05:32] don't care it's as many as God will call
[1:05:36] yes it's up to God God does the calling
[1:05:39] and as God calls they respond as we all
[1:05:43] respond we responded to God's call as
[1:05:46] God called amen it's as many as God will
[1:05:49] call that we repent and be baptized in
[1:05:53] the name of Jesus Christ now there's
[1:05:56] obviously no other name that we should
[1:05:59] be baptized in we know only the name of
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ I mean uh Paul said later
[1:06:07] in the scripture all that you do in word
[1:06:09] I believe it was Paul all that you do in
[1:06:11] word or indeed do in the name of Jesus
[1:06:15] Christ well what more word or deed do
[1:06:19] you get than one of the uh uh ordinances
[1:06:23] that he left us at being baptized
[1:06:26] right in the name of Jesus Christ raise
[1:06:30] now the world and denominations Satan
[1:06:34] has tried to substitute him for uh some
[1:06:38] titles of father son holy ghost or
[1:06:40] something to this effect that's probably
[1:06:43] the main popular one of their Trinity is
[1:06:46] father son Holy Ghost but you can't
[1:06:48] substitute the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:51] amen you remember when brother Brandon
[1:06:53] went to that uh that place at medium or
[1:06:56] whatever it was and and U uh she she was
[1:07:01] able by her Divinity to Le levitate the
[1:07:03] table and challenged anybody to make
[1:07:06] that table go down amen you all know the
[1:07:09] story and says he says in the name of
[1:07:12] the Holy Roman Pope stood right there in
[1:07:16] the name of the President of United
[1:07:17] States stayed right there in the father
[1:07:20] son the Holy Ghost and that table stayed
[1:07:22] right there amen but when he with the
[1:07:25] authority of God spoke forth and said in
[1:07:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:07:31] table Slamm to the ground so hard and
[1:07:33] like to broke the legs off amen amen
[1:07:37] because that's where the authority lies
[1:07:39] it doesn't lie on a title of a father or
[1:07:41] a son or a holy it lies in the name
[1:07:44] Jesus Christ that's the only place you
[1:07:47] can find it because that's the only
[1:07:49] place it'll be in the name of Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ but first repent see that's
[1:07:54] probably a lot of people have is full
[1:07:56] repentance amen repentance means Lord
[1:07:59] I'm sorry amen I didn't mean to didn't
[1:08:02] want to or don't want to act that way
[1:08:05] forgive me Lord there's true repentance
[1:08:07] it's not a stop and a continuation it's
[1:08:09] a complete 160 uh 360 turn around or 180
[1:08:14] excuse me uh turn around and go the
[1:08:16] opposite direction yes that's repentance
[1:08:20] yes then
[1:08:22] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[1:08:25] of the Holy Holy Ghost you shall receive
[1:08:27] a new birth that new birth comes when we
[1:08:30] obey the scripture
[1:08:32] yes justification sanctification
[1:08:35] three-step process we know justification
[1:08:39] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost what as
[1:08:44] brother Ram said makes way for the
[1:08:47] person of Jesus Christ to come and live
[1:08:50] in
[1:08:51] you amen a baptism is just a submersion
[1:08:56] that's what a baptism when you're
[1:08:57] baptized you're immersed in water you're
[1:09:00] baptized with the Holy Ghost the same
[1:09:02] thing that's why we cry a lot of times
[1:09:04] Lord I give us a refilling amen it's not
[1:09:07] a refilling in your soul that that is
[1:09:10] sealed yes the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:09:14] seals the devil out it's sealed you

[1:09:46] in my life amen to obey your word and to
[1:09:50] live for you a refilling is a a is just
[1:09:54] a rean anointing amen of the holy spirit
[1:09:57] because God once he sealed you you're
[1:10:00] sealed praise the Lord You're sealed you
[1:10:02] see I I want more of God you cannot get
[1:10:06] more of God in your
[1:10:08] soul you you really honestly you can't
[1:10:12] really get more of God on you you can
[1:10:14] receive more of God Amen you you you can

[1:10:27] to you God's giving you all he can give

[1:10:40] door my heart I want to let you every
[1:10:42] door in my life I want you in every
[1:10:44] facet of my life amen amen in full
[1:10:47] capacity in every way amen praise the
[1:10:50] Lord amen God comes into your soul he
[1:10:53] pours it's like the Spoonful out the
[1:10:55] ocean every part of the ocean that that
[1:10:57] ocean it's not the entire ocean but
[1:10:59] every part of that ocean is now in you
[1:11:01] every part of God is now in you yes amen
[1:11:05] amen that that becomes who you are amen
[1:11:08] now we need uh that takes care of that
[1:11:11] it works on the the the soul works on
[1:11:13] the spirit begins to work on the flesh
[1:11:16] amen but then that anointing of that
[1:11:18] Spirit coming down on us just as it day
[1:11:20] on the de did on the day of Pentecost it
[1:11:23] didn't just go in them it went on them
[1:11:26] and then in them amen praise the lord we
[1:11:29] need the exact same thing yes not just
[1:11:31] in
[1:11:33] on help keep us on Lord which you lead
[1:11:37] and guide help lead and guide us into
[1:11:39] his truth that Spirit of that life now
[1:11:43] brings us into his presence amen
[1:11:46] when
[1:11:48] when say well I did on January 12th
[1:11:53] 1985 I did
[1:11:56] uh December 6 in 2004 I did way back in
[1:12:02] 1944 or whatever you want to say I did
[1:12:05] and a lot of people say that you know
[1:12:07] they're excited I receive the you I've
[1:12:09] talked to some people they could give
[1:12:11] you almost the second they say I I don't
[1:12:14] know about you friend but when I when
[1:12:16] the when the Lord filled me with his
[1:12:18] Spirit the time of the day was oblivious
[1:12:21] to me
[1:12:22] yes I couldn't have cared less what time
[1:12:25] it was must L look at my watch right
[1:12:28] when he filled me with his Spirit the
[1:12:30] day the time that was all that meant
[1:12:33] nothing to me right amen I I honestly I
[1:12:37] can I can tell you what happened I can
[1:12:39] tell you the experience I can't tell you
[1:12:41] what it was a Sunday I know that but I
[1:12:44] can't tell you what day it was I don't
[1:12:45] know what year it was uh I think it was
[1:12:48] around 1985 but I don't I don't remember
[1:12:51] for sure the time i' I've met people
[1:12:54] that tell me what time it was when they
[1:12:56] received the Holy Ghost now I don't say
[1:12:58] anything but I'm sorry I I doubt that
[1:13:02] very
[1:13:03] seriously I if you received a true
[1:13:06] genuine indwelling presence of Christ
[1:13:08] the time of day is oblivious to you
[1:13:11] that's the that's the last thing you
[1:13:13] don't get the Holy Ghost and say I
[1:13:14] wonder what time it
[1:13:17] is it doesn't brother randam said a new
[1:13:20] birth is a mess just like a natural
[1:13:22] birth a spiritual birth is a a mess amen
[1:13:27] people sometimes at the altar wherever
[1:13:29] it is slobbered
[1:13:31] crying you're a mess you don't think
[1:13:34] about getting the Holy G in that
[1:13:36] condition
[1:13:37] oh oh okay now I can tell everybody I
[1:13:40] received
[1:13:42] it
[1:13:44] my I I'm ass sure you believe the same
[1:13:47] way your your thought wasn't well you
[1:13:50] know 10 down 10 years down the road I
[1:13:52] can tell people what day it was what
[1:13:53] time it was and
[1:13:58] unless I'm just uh
[1:14:01] unique that was the last thing I thought
[1:14:03] about but I know people that have come
[1:14:05] and said oh you know and they would even
[1:14:08] challenge you if you if you don't really
[1:14:11] know the day or or or or whatever it was
[1:14:14] if you don't know the day and Daye I
[1:14:16] doubt you got it and I'm thinking if you
[1:14:19] do know I doubt you got I don't say that
[1:14:22] but I mean people have put it to the
[1:14:23] places it's like they they actually
[1:14:25] doubt you have the Holy Ghost if you
[1:14:27] can't tell them what day and time you
[1:14:29] got
[1:14:30] it like that's the last thing I thought
[1:14:33] about that that wasn't
[1:14:37] even that that wasn't in my mind and and
[1:14:41] you get the Holy Ghost friend that you
[1:14:43] don't think about what time it
[1:14:45] is amen you might can tell where you
[1:14:48] were or you know maybe approximate time
[1:14:50] or something like that but you know date
[1:14:53] time and not uh anyway that that's uh I
[1:14:58] don't see that but that's that's what we
[1:15:00] need but see even that they say well
[1:15:05] that that was an experience that you had
[1:15:07] in this flesh but when did the when did
[1:15:10] it actually take
[1:15:12] place amen actually took place before
[1:15:15] the foundation of the world Amen how
[1:15:19] many scriptures do we have to tell us
[1:15:21] that I wrote three of them down amen
[1:15:25] three scriptures down that you can go
[1:15:26] and reference to and and and realize
[1:15:29] this didn't just happen last week this
[1:15:31] didn't just happen last month this just
[1:15:34] didn't happen 20 years ago or whatever
[1:15:36] this happened before the you if you are
[1:15:39] ever God you are God's before the
[1:15:41] foundation of the world right am

[1:15:45] 138 Revelation
[1:15:48] 1778 Ephesians
[1:15:50] 1:4 before the foundation of the world
[1:15:54] he knew knew me praise God because I
[1:15:57] belong to him it was before it was
[1:16:00] before the world was ever formed I was I
[1:16:02] belong to him amen now I may have come
[1:16:05] to the knowledge of that at a certain
[1:16:07] time I may have received the experience
[1:16:10] of the new birth at a specific time but
[1:16:13] this all took place in God's mind before
[1:16:15] the foundation of the world Amen that's
[1:16:18] whose names that's where our names
[1:16:20] written on the Lamb's Book of Life from
[1:16:22] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:16:24] God put them there that's why they
[1:16:25] cannot be removed remember we talked
[1:16:27] about your name's on the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:30] Life it cannot be removed from The Book
[1:16:33] of Life yes that's just a recording of
[1:16:35] every life of everyone that's ever born
[1:16:37] but the Lamb's Book of Life is a
[1:16:39] specific book of those those the the the
[1:16:43] Mind those are in the mind of God before
[1:16:45] the foundation of the world and those
[1:16:48] put on there now and I'm not looking uh
[1:16:51] I'm not looking to say a hypothetical
[1:16:53] book with George Newton Ben the Third on
[1:16:55] it that's not what I'm talking about
[1:16:59] amen I'm talking that just identifies
[1:17:01] this flesh guy I'm talking about who you
[1:17:04] are in
[1:17:06] Christ and it was before the foundation
[1:17:08] of the world who we are in Christ that
[1:17:11] brings us back to our position our place
[1:17:16] our
[1:17:17] placement where do we belong in that
[1:17:20] body what is our position in that body
[1:17:23] one of the one of the probably greatest
[1:17:26] selling Christian books I think of our
[1:17:28] time in the past 15 20 years however
[1:17:31] long it's been has probably been a
[1:17:33] purpose-driven life you probably all
[1:17:36] heard that book I've never read it you
[1:17:38] may have read
[1:17:40] it I'm assuming there's nothing wrong
[1:17:42] with the book or scripture I don't know
[1:17:45] I I agree with the title uh I think I
[1:17:48] think the title is very poignant to
[1:17:50] understand what life means to you right
[1:17:53] what purpose you have in life but I
[1:17:57] don't know I I don't know what's in the
[1:17:59] book but I don't know what it how you
[1:18:02] can know what your purpose in life is
[1:18:04] unless you know where you're
[1:18:05] positionally placed in the body right as
[1:18:09] a Christian as a true born again
[1:18:11] Christian as somebody you know just say
[1:18:15] well I play an instrument or I lead
[1:18:17] songs or I preach or I do this or I do
[1:18:20] that whatever position those are just
[1:18:21] nominal positions that's that's those
[1:18:24] are physical position that's not even a
[1:18:26] spiritual position right amen that's
[1:18:28] just a nomal it's a physical position
[1:18:30] that's that that's a whole another
[1:18:33] that's a whole another subject we're not
[1:18:34] talking about but that brings us around
[1:18:36] to understand how can we know that how
[1:18:38] can we
[1:18:40] know what drives Us in life what purpose
[1:18:43] we have what purpose we serve in life
[1:18:47] unless we know who we are in
[1:18:50] Christ you've got to know who you are
[1:18:52] what position where you're placed in the
[1:18:54] body to know who you are to be able to
[1:18:57] serve him and to live in this life amen
[1:19:00] you've got to know who you are who am I
[1:19:02] first of all that's the main thing to
[1:19:06] understand the purpose that drives your
[1:19:08] life is to understand what position you
[1:19:12] feel in the body of Christ amen they run
[1:19:16] synonymous only way you can find out but
[1:19:19] in the bo but in the body in the body of
[1:19:22] Christ we find as our spiritual growth
[1:19:25] continues we were in him in his mind
[1:19:28] before the foundation of the world yes
[1:19:30] amen amen praise the
[1:19:32] Lord I feel like I want to read those
[1:19:34] real quick let's just let's read
[1:19:41] Ephesians Ephesians 1:4 look at this
[1:19:46] anybody has any question I don't think
[1:19:47] we do but I just F to read this one now
[1:19:51] Revelation 138 and Revelation 178 speak
[1:19:54] speak also of those names uh who were in
[1:19:58] The Book of the land's book of life
[1:19:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:01] Ephesians one says according as he had
[1:20:05] chosen
[1:20:07] Us in him now for in him there's that's
[1:20:11] a placement yes in him is the position a
[1:20:15] placement in him before the foundation
[1:20:20] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:20:22] blameless with uh without blame before
[1:20:25] him in love now I don't how you arue you
[1:20:27] can argue with the scripture all you
[1:20:28] want but right there he says he chose us
[1:20:31] before the foundation of the world yes
[1:20:33] again that's how he was able to put our
[1:20:35] names on the Lamb's Book of Life those
[1:20:38] that are his chosen amen he chose us
[1:20:41] before the foundation of the world put
[1:20:43] our names on that Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:47] that's who we are we come to a
[1:20:49] realization of it on a certain date time
[1:20:52] whatever it might be but we were always
[1:20:54] in him and if you always were in him you
[1:20:58] will be again hence the song I've been
[1:21:01] redeemed right praise God why because I
[1:21:05] was there to start
[1:21:08] with I'm going back
[1:21:11] there from a fallen
[1:21:13] condition born in sin shaped iniquity
[1:21:16] come World speaking lies back to the
[1:21:18] mind of God again amen praise the Lord
[1:21:22] I've been redeemed by his love Divine
[1:21:26] Praise the Lord now let's go over to
[1:21:28] First
[1:21:33] John first John not St John but first
[1:21:36] John chapter
[1:21:39] 5 those who may not know it's right
[1:21:41] before
[1:21:46] Revelation right before Jude right
[1:21:48] before r
[1:21:55] first John chapter
[1:22:00] 5 I was gonna want to get to two
[1:22:03] specific scriptures uh verses here but I
[1:22:06] want to start with verse one um I just F
[1:22:10] to do that
[1:22:12] whosoever first John 51 whosoever
[1:22:16] believe that Jesus believeth that Jesus
[1:22:19] is the Christ is born of
[1:22:22] God and everyone that that loveth him
[1:22:26] that begot that uh loveth him that begot
[1:22:28] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[1:22:32] now notice the word here
[1:22:36] believeth uh that word is not just
[1:22:38] simple a carnal understanding of or
[1:22:42] having evidence to
[1:22:44] believe the devil believes Jesus Christ
[1:22:48] the devil knows who Jesus Christ is you
[1:22:52] can't deceive and confuse the Devil with
[1:22:54] a trinity because he knows better yes
[1:22:58] just like we should yes amen which we'll
[1:23:02] get into in a couple verses in a minute
[1:23:04] uh he knows better he knows who he is
[1:23:07] but if you go over to uh to St John I'm
[1:23:10] just going to go over you don't have to
[1:23:11] turn St John 1:12 but as many as
[1:23:15] received
[1:23:17] him amen as many as received him not
[1:23:22] just believed but rece received him
[1:23:26] we've gone all the reception before when
[1:23:29] you receive something to yourself it's
[1:23:31] something that you that you've taken
[1:23:33] unto yourself that you believe not not
[1:23:35] just not just believe but you actually
[1:23:38] receive to put into action it's a light
[1:23:41] and there's where the devil all of his
[1:23:44] followers probably in there I say many
[1:23:46] Christians fall
[1:23:47] short they may say they believed in
[1:23:51] Jesus but had they received him Amen to
[1:23:53] receive him is to become him to live the
[1:23:57] life of Jesus Christ to the best in our
[1:24:00] human flesh amen because we've been born
[1:24:04] again correct so this life of God lives
[1:24:06] in us so we become as we receive him we
[1:24:11] receive all that he is to receive him is
[1:24:14] to receive his
[1:24:16] word amen no doubt no disbelief you
[1:24:20] don't chop parts of it out you don't
[1:24:23] energ your own opinion and thoughts it
[1:24:26] is the word of God to receive him is to
[1:24:30] receive his word all of it amen you
[1:24:33] don't receive portions of it well I
[1:24:35] don't believe it quite like this but
[1:24:37] that's what he
[1:24:39] said uh I could tell you that the
[1:24:42] bathrooms are out that door to the right
[1:24:45] but unless you receive that you might
[1:24:47] wander out there you might go around the
[1:24:48] building well he he said it but you know
[1:24:52] I I think I I think it might be just as
[1:24:54] good to go out here you go out that door
[1:24:56] and you're in the vestibule you're like
[1:24:57] well I don't see any bathroom anywhere
[1:24:59] maybe there's a door there's a door here
[1:25:03] somewhere amen amen but if you receive
[1:25:06] what I say you're going to go through
[1:25:07] that doorm to the right right and you
[1:25:09] know what you're G to find the
[1:25:13] bathroom amen you can you can make it up
[1:25:16] in your opinion all you want you can try
[1:25:18] to interject something uh with with God
[1:25:21] in his word but he says what do he mean
[1:25:24] means right when he says it this way
[1:25:27] that's exactly what he means yes praise
[1:25:30] the Lord now you're looking and says for
[1:25:32] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[1:25:35] Christ well again we've already
[1:25:36] established we know the devil believes
[1:25:37] that Jesus is the Christ he knows that
[1:25:39] amen he's been burnt by many times he
[1:25:43] understands but as we look in St John as
[1:25:46] many as receive him receive him to them
[1:25:51] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1:25:54] praise the Lord now let's continue
[1:25:56] reading on on first John whosoever
[1:25:58] believe that Jesus is the Christ is born
[1:26:00] of God everyone that loveth him that
[1:26:02] begot loveth him that also uh uh also
[1:26:06] that is begotten of him but this we know
[1:26:09] that we love God that we love the
[1:26:11] children of God when we love
[1:26:15] God that's that's why brother R said he
[1:26:17] God would rather me love you than love
[1:26:18] him because when I'm loving you I'm
[1:26:20] loving him amen praise the Lord and and
[1:26:23] do what
[1:26:25] keep his Commandments what are his
[1:26:27] Commandments not just the 10 in Exodus
[1:26:31] 20 these are God's Commandments amen
[1:26:34] Genesis 1 to revelation 22 are God's
[1:26:37] Commandments keep his word amen amen who
[1:26:41] is supposed to keep his word those that
[1:26:44] love God
[1:26:47] yes well if you've received him there's
[1:26:50] no way but to love him yes if you've
[1:26:53] received him now you can believe on him
[1:26:55] and not love him yes amen but if you've
[1:26:57] received him unto yourself to obedience
[1:27:00] and life to the believing and receiving
[1:27:04] and and living by his word his
[1:27:07] commands is to be a what I call a
[1:27:11] Christian amen that's what a Christian
[1:27:14] is Christian is a word that means to be
[1:27:18] Christlike yes well I there's probably a
[1:27:22] lot of people that say they're Christian
[1:27:24] chrans and you look at their life and
[1:27:26] they probably in their lives couldn't be
[1:27:27] further from right amen hopefully
[1:27:30] prayerfully they're working to that
[1:27:32] they're getting to that place they're
[1:27:34] doing their best to try to shed Mr
[1:27:37] whatever Mrs whatever to gain the
[1:27:40] relationship with Jesus Christ to become
[1:27:43] Miss Jesus Christ amen but those who
[1:27:47] receive
[1:27:48] him Amen to them gave he power the
[1:27:52] authority to become sons of God we know
[1:27:56] that if we that we love the children of
[1:27:58] God when we love God and keep his
[1:28:02] Commandments praise the Lord now you
[1:28:04] don't say I believe I receive and then
[1:28:08] don't do what he
[1:28:09] says no you might as well go through
[1:28:11] that door looking for the
[1:28:13] bathroom and you might as well walk
[1:28:15] through the wall here trying to find the
[1:28:17] bathroom amen it's just as it's just as
[1:28:21] illogical amen praise the Lord now let's
[1:28:24] keep going for this is the love of God
[1:28:27] that we keep his Commandments and his
[1:28:30] Commandments are not Grievous amen not
[1:28:33] not to a Christian a lot of people look
[1:28:35] at them and think that they are but
[1:28:36] they're not not if you've receiv
[1:28:38] received the Holy Ghost they're not if
[1:28:40] you've received the Holy Ghost you're
[1:28:42] born again they just become a part of
[1:28:44] life I mean living his word is no more
[1:28:47] Grievious to me than living my
[1:28:51] life because it becomes who I am am much
[1:28:55] for what for what it says whatsoever who
[1:28:59] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:29:01] world and this is the victory that
[1:29:04] overcometh the world even our faith
[1:29:06] faith where do we get our faith how can
[1:29:08] we come to know that we really operate
[1:29:11] in
[1:29:12] faith because we know who we are in
[1:29:15] Christ amen we know positionally Place
[1:29:18] who we are in Christ to have what real
[1:29:22] operating faith yeah Foundation the
[1:29:25] statue of a perfect man Faith praise the
[1:29:28] Lord can't deny it friends it all comes
[1:29:31] around to the same thing who is he that
[1:29:33] overcometh the world but he that
[1:29:36] believeth that Jesus is the son of God
[1:29:39] this is he that came by water and blood
[1:29:42] even Jesus Christ not by water only but
[1:29:46] by water and blood it is and it is the
[1:29:50] spirit that beareth witness because the
[1:29:52] spirit is true amen amen praise the Lord
[1:29:57] remember those that worship Him must
[1:30:00] worship Him in spirit and in truth amen
[1:30:04] praise the Lord but look at this now we
[1:30:07] get to these because this will kind of
[1:30:09] glue them together that these are the
[1:30:11] two verses I wanted to get to seventh
[1:30:14] verse for there are three that bear
[1:30:18] record in heaven they bear record where
[1:30:21] in heaven the Father the the word and
[1:30:25] the Holy Ghost and these three are what
[1:30:28] one one not three one the Father the
[1:30:33] word the logos the word is just the
[1:30:36] logos that came out of God Amen and the
[1:30:40] Holy Ghost which is just the spirit of
[1:30:42] God those that's just the spirit of God
[1:30:45] it's not a third person it's not the
[1:30:48] third person or a lesser person in the
[1:30:52] Trinity it is simply God's
[1:30:57] spirit it's that easy it's not
[1:31:00] complicated it's that easy is simply the
[1:31:02] spirit of God so the Father the word the
[1:31:06] logos that that came out of God that be
[1:31:08] the word that came that became MDC uh
[1:31:12] the the cloud by day the uh the the
[1:31:15] pillar of Fire by night uh became Jesus
[1:31:18] Christ that logos came out of God Amen
[1:31:22] remember the only begotten
[1:31:24] son the Father the word the Loos and the
[1:31:27] Holy Ghost these three are are are one
[1:31:31] amen they are one yes amen now you can't
[1:31:35] chop him up remember when brother green
[1:31:37] used to say uh talk about a testimony
[1:31:40] with the uh the the Jewish rabbis over
[1:31:43] when he go to Israel not like oh uh uh
[1:31:47] Pastor you can't chop up God and feed in
[1:31:50] the three pieces and feed him to us and
[1:31:52] and brother Green's like well uh Rabbi I
[1:31:56] I am not trying to chop your God up into
[1:31:58] three I believe he's one just like you
[1:32:00] believe amen see that help bring a
[1:32:04] cohesion it's it's not complicated amen
[1:32:08] but it takes Revelation to see a lot of
[1:32:10] people laugh these three are one now
[1:32:14] look at this eth verse and there are
[1:32:16] three that bear witness in Earth in
[1:32:20] Earth the spirit and the water and the
[1:32:23] blood
[1:32:24] and these three agree in
[1:32:28] one they are brought for a purpose of
[1:32:32] agreement they all three come together
[1:32:35] to serve a purpose amen the spirit the
[1:32:38] water the blood all come together they
[1:32:40] are not
[1:32:42] one but they agree in one amen it's a
[1:32:46] three-step process I like this uh that
[1:32:49] we just went over but I remember when uh
[1:32:53] Daniel made this pull pit for us and I
[1:32:56] hadn't thought of it I looked at it and
[1:32:58] I liked the cross and the way it was
[1:33:00] made uh but when brother Roger came he
[1:33:03] used it we were over on Country Club
[1:33:05] that's when that's when Daniel first
[1:33:07] made it for us and we started using it
[1:33:08] was over at Country Club and Roger first
[1:33:11] time he took it he used it he didn't
[1:33:13] have one at the time he thought how
[1:33:16] inspired and I didn't see it till later
[1:33:18] or when he told me I inspired that
[1:33:20] Daniel made three steps to the Cross oh
[1:33:24] yeah it's three steps on here to get to
[1:33:27] the Cross three steps a new birth amen
[1:33:32] justification sanctification Holy Ghost
[1:33:34] we just talked about that amen the
[1:33:37] spirit the water the blood they all
[1:33:39] agree in one they're all there to
[1:33:42] coincide for a purpose Amen in agreement
[1:33:46] they're not
[1:33:47] one amen you can be justified and not be
[1:33:52] Sanctified yes you can be justified and
[1:33:55] Sanctified and not have the Holy Ghost
[1:33:58] and be born again amen now you can have
[1:34:03] you can have an
[1:34:05] anointing and not be born again right
[1:34:09] amen because remember they only agree in
[1:34:11] one they are not one you can have an
[1:34:14] anointing you can have a state of
[1:34:17] justification amen and live in a state
[1:34:20] of justification or sanctification
[1:34:22] Luther Wesley and the message you can
[1:34:25] live in a state of justification or
[1:34:28] sanctification your life can be cleaned
[1:34:30] up and still not be born again right
[1:34:33] still not be uh had the requirements of
[1:34:36] entering into the kingdom of God which
[1:34:38] Jesus so poignantly gave to Nicodemus
[1:34:41] that we just read qualification getting
[1:34:44] into the kingdom of God was being born
[1:34:46] again amen but you have to have
[1:34:50] justification to get to sanctification
[1:34:53] you have to have justification and
[1:34:56] sanctification to get to being filled
[1:34:58] with the Holy Ghost what did Peter say
[1:35:00] on the day of Pentecost amen again
[1:35:04] repent and be baptized and you shall
[1:35:09] receive praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[1:35:13] it's a three-step
[1:35:15] process but you can you can be justified
[1:35:19] but look at look at Judas in the
[1:35:22] scripture I I don't want to go to the
[1:35:24] scripture but but in the scripture uh I
[1:35:27] believe it's John
[1:35:29] 17:17 um he he was justified in
[1:35:33] Believing on Jesus Christ Judas became
[1:35:35] one of the disciples yeah that's right
[1:35:37] he was justified Believe by Believing on
[1:35:40] Jesus Christ we just went through that
[1:35:42] he believed him received him in in so
[1:35:45] much that he followed him everywhere he
[1:35:47] went the reproach and whatever else came
[1:35:50] with it when they when when Jesus stood
[1:35:53] out there on in Matthew 10 and said go
[1:35:56] cast out the Devils speak in tongues
[1:35:59] free people from the bondage of Satan go
[1:36:02] out to house and house if if they don't
[1:36:05] receive you knock the dust off their
[1:36:07] feet and go to the next one Judas was
[1:36:10] right
[1:36:11] there but when it come to receiving the
[1:36:13] Holy
[1:36:15] Ghost and and in St John
[1:36:18] 1717 Jesus said sanctify them Father by
[1:36:22] Thy word for thy word is truth sanctify
[1:36:24] them he was justified in believing Jesus
[1:36:27] Sanctified by the word when Jesus stood
[1:36:29] there and said sanctify them but he
[1:36:31] could not go on in receiving the Holy
[1:36:34] Ghost to the day of Pentecost he sold
[1:36:36] out his Lord Jesus or he sold out Jesus
[1:36:40] he obviously wasn't his Lord but he sold
[1:36:42] out Jesus for 30 pieces of silver when
[1:36:44] hung himself right fell on his sword
[1:36:47] however amen he killed himself Judas
[1:36:50] went killed himself threw the money down
[1:36:53] didn't want the money at that part at
[1:36:54] that point and killed himself could not
[1:36:57] go on to receiving the Holy Ghost right
[1:37:00] so you can be justified you can be
[1:37:01] Sanctified the most dangerous position a
[1:37:04] Believer could be in is stuck between
[1:37:06] sanctification and filled with the Holy
[1:37:08] Ghost because your life's cleaned up you
[1:37:10] think everything's great and you know
[1:37:12] you go to church and you're part of
[1:37:13] church and but until the Holy Spirit
[1:37:16] until the life of Jesus Christ comes and
[1:37:19] makes his permanent resident in your
[1:37:21] soul amen then you fallen short
[1:37:24] short amen and yet all of that is just
[1:37:28] the beginning of our walk with Christ
[1:37:30] it's just the beginning of our it is our
[1:37:33] new birth but the beginning of where we
[1:37:35] get to being placed in that body amen of
[1:37:39] of being in the body of Christ that
[1:37:41] three-step process the three stages
[1:37:43] justification under Luther
[1:37:45] sanctification under Wesley the Holy
[1:37:47] Ghost and Pentecost and receiving the
[1:37:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:37:51] person of Christ coming and living in
[1:37:52] you is that three-step process amen amen
[1:37:57] but now we're looking to the placement
[1:38:00] amen Lord willing I'm going to close
[1:38:01] here in just a second but Lord willing
[1:38:04] uh next time we'll get to the place
[1:38:07] that uh we can look at the Old Testament
[1:38:10] and the the the justification
[1:38:15] sanctification the Holy Ghost they came
[1:38:17] out of Egypt they went across the river
[1:38:20] amen and they got into the new land amen
[1:38:23] remember their Palestine is our Holy
[1:38:26] Ghost
[1:38:28] amen when we talk about that that that
[1:38:31] Promised Land our promised land is the
[1:38:35] holy spirit yes God didn't Jesus didn't
[1:38:38] come and say okay now or God and say
[1:38:40] okay now you Gentiles I give you uh
[1:38:43] between the Mississippi River and the
[1:38:45] and and the and and the uh Pacific Ocean
[1:38:50] uh and between the the Gulf of Mexico uh
[1:38:53] to the border of can I get that is your
[1:38:55] possession Gentiles go and possess God
[1:38:57] didn't give us that right we don't have
[1:39:00] a natural physical land like he gave to
[1:39:04] the children of Israel yes that was
[1:39:06] their Promised Land what was promised to
[1:39:10] us what was promised to us was that he
[1:39:14] would come back and live in US yes that
[1:39:18] is the promise that we have as Gentiles
[1:39:22] that we could be B borned again and his
[1:39:24] Spirit would live in us that is our
[1:39:27] Promised Land praise the Lord sobody say
[1:39:30] I'm going to the promised land I'm in
[1:39:32] the promised land yes praise the Lord
[1:39:36] the promised land is his Spirit his life
[1:39:39] amen but then after they got into their
[1:39:42] Promised
[1:39:44] Land God still told Joshua to divide
[1:39:47] them up and to give them their portion
[1:39:50] he still Joshua still had even on the
[1:39:53] other side of Jordan uh uh he was given
[1:39:58] instruction Joshua was given instruction
[1:40:01] to positionally place each one of the 12
[1:40:04] tribes amen and the
[1:40:07] priesthood they still had to be
[1:40:09] positionally placed amen praise the Lord
[1:40:13] let me read
[1:40:15] this amen now you can be remember you
[1:40:19] can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:40:22] and not not have the Holy GH and not be
[1:40:24] born again but if you're born again

[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:31] amen praise the
[1:40:33] Lord visible Union if you're married to
[1:40:36] Christ Christ is the word of God in St
[1:40:38] John first chapter beginning was the
[1:40:40] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:40:41] God same was made flesh dwelt Among Us
[1:40:44] Christ was living was the Living Word he
[1:40:47] always was the word he is still the word
[1:40:50] he always will be the word he was the
[1:40:52] only he was only the
[1:40:54] manifestation of the attributes of God
[1:40:58] for he was the Son of God the begotten
[1:41:01] Son of God and any son of uh uh and any
[1:41:06] son or daughter any son is the
[1:41:09] attributes of their
[1:41:11] father just as you were in the genes of
[1:41:14] your father in the body of your father
[1:41:16] when he was a young boy we go back in MA
[1:41:20] Hebrews tells us that amen that that
[1:41:23] Levi paid ties through Abraham when he
[1:41:26] was his great great great grandson uh
[1:41:28] grandson his granddaddy great great
[1:41:31] great amen he says even as your daddy
[1:41:34] was a young boy you were in him yet you
[1:41:37] could not have fellowship with him
[1:41:38] because you didn't know he didn't know
[1:41:40] you but then through the beaing uh
[1:41:42] breeding ground of mother you were
[1:41:44] brought forth into the Earth and become
[1:41:46] in the image of your father that he
[1:41:48] could have fellowship with you and so
[1:41:51] were you sons of God Sons and Daughters
[1:41:54] of God before there even was a Moon Star
[1:41:58] or molecule you were the sons and
[1:42:00] daughters of God praise the Lord for you
[1:42:04] are only the physical manifestation of
[1:42:08] the attributes that was God in the
[1:42:12] beginning as we say in the beginning
[1:42:14] with God there was in the beginning amen
[1:42:16] eternity has no beginning so God is
[1:42:18] eternal God had no beginning but as we
[1:42:21] say God at the beginning there there was
[1:42:23] only one form of eternal life Saints and
[1:42:25] we've said that before notice there's
[1:42:27] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:42:29] God only one form of eternal life and
[1:42:33] that was in you you didn't know anything
[1:42:37] about it neither did you know when you
[1:42:38] was in your Earthly father but you are
[1:42:41] manifested now in His image now
[1:42:44] spiritually in whose image not my daddy
[1:42:48] I'm thankful he was a born again
[1:42:49] believer but not my daddy but my father
[1:42:54] God we are now in His image praise the
[1:42:59] male and female we are in His image amen
[1:43:03] praise the Lord why because we've become
[1:43:05] as he is the spirit of God living us
[1:43:09] through
[1:43:10] Us Praise the Lord the image of God you
[1:43:13] are made you're manifested for his glory
[1:43:15] and therefore as sure as your Gene had
[1:43:17] to be in your father before your natural
[1:43:19] birth your spiritual Gene had to be in
[1:43:22] God God because you're an expression of
[1:43:24] his attributes and his thoughts before
[1:43:26] the foundation of the world we've said
[1:43:28] many times how could we ever claim to
[1:43:31] have eternal
[1:43:33] life God's the only form of eternal life
[1:43:36] yes correct if God's the only form of
[1:43:40] eternal life then how can I be
[1:43:43] Eternal amen because that part of who
[1:43:46] God was that he placed in me was to
[1:43:49] become him amen from before the
[1:43:51] foundation of the world
[1:43:53] that's who we all are amen now the only
[1:43:56] thing that separates us from getting to
[1:43:59] that complete that full manifestation
[1:44:01] that full Redemptive property amen is
[1:44:06] the Redemption of these bodies am amen
[1:44:10] full Redemption comes with the
[1:44:12] Redemption of this body right praise the
[1:44:15] Lord that's when we reach that full
[1:44:17] Place some people believe that you can
[1:44:19] only receive the your full place of
[1:44:22] adoption when that happens I'm sorry
[1:44:24] friend what's the point of having
[1:44:26] reached a place of full
[1:44:29] adoption when you're not here anymore
[1:44:32] right the whole point of our our full
[1:44:35] placement of adoption in the body of
[1:44:37] Christ is in how we live here now yes
[1:44:41] what good would it do you over there
[1:44:44] right I mean we will be it over there
[1:44:48] but there's there's not going to be this
[1:44:50] sticky flesh and and all that we live
[1:44:53] what's the point of that right the point
[1:44:55] of adoption is to know who we are now
[1:44:58] yes to know where we are in the body of
[1:44:59] Christ now to live our lives in that
[1:45:03] position praise the Lord you understand
[1:45:07] amen let me read this I wasn't going to
[1:45:09] read this I'm to read this one more
[1:45:10] scripture and I'm closing it is second
