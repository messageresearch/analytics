approaching not sweetness amen prayer [Music] um there is a i live in a trailer court that lives that has lots of homeless people around me and they sleep in the arroyo and they and um and they don't congregate on the corners and and i drove by to do errands and i saw this as you know there's been a poop spreader around in my place and i clean it up and they dig another pile and it looks like cat or small dog and i've been watching it to see what if i can discern a pattern to it well then i as you know okay so then i drive by a couple days ago and i see this darth vader doll i thought it was an effigy that had been burned it was about two feet tall i didn't know what it was i just got out of my car didn't look right it looked satanic and i got up next to it and and it wasn't burned it was just a doll that had been that was black and it and it was the head of darth vader which is i realized represents satan to whoever stuck it up there and i realized that god was showing me pope is one of the things that satanists use in their their rights and i realize that my place has been staked out and there's now they're starting to spread it from my place over to the mailbox and which is right close to me and so i am asked and i talked to my neighbor who was a christian and he's backslid he's got a filthy mouth and i talked to him and i said you know i think this neighborhood's been hexed it's trying to put a hex on this place he says oh it's been hexed and i said you know what because he claimed christianity to me i said we can unhex it and so i'm asking the church to pray with me because this is the last day this is their last chance to see christ i want i'm asking the church if you would please join with me to have to take that satanic spirit and put it back on the devil so that these people can see that they that there is that their god is is they'll see the fire and that they will realize their god is nothing and and to save them this is their i pray that this is their mount carmel and so i'm asking the church to pray with me that they will lift this area up and and get this hex off of there and take it and put it right back on the devil and um and and dominic was telling me when he was younger he had a witch that had been stuck stuff all around and then she came back to him and she said you know your god is stronger than my god because every time i i put a hex on you it comes back on me and it can remind our man amen amen definitely be praying with you concerning that immense amen amen any other unspoken or spoken requests yes amen god bless you amen

it's going to take that total surrender of our lives into his hands amen a total surrender is going to bring a rapture on a bride one day she completely realizes who she is and surrenders to that spirit that's true amen hallelujah we want to do anything and everything the lord puts upon our hearts and shows us to do in our lives amen we're all here for a reason we're all here for a purpose we just need to follow that purpose whatever it is that god gives to us amen praise the lord amen it looks like uh you can be seated if you like hey man i want to take a minute to see if anybody had a testimony or a song on your heart yes i have a testimony that happened back in 1974 i thought in relevance to what sister matisse was mentioning i was a young christian catholic boy coming into the life of god's reveal word we were at 4th avenue and 6th street having a street service a street revival brother anthony was preaching his heart out and right across the street was a bar and all of a sudden four or five men came out of the bar and were holding hands and saying father son holy ghost father son holy ghost brother anthony said let's bow our heads amen and we pray the prayer of faith remember greater he that's in us in the world and by time it wasn't a long prayer but it was a prayer of faith and by the time we looked up it all disappeared see there's power in the name of jesus remember who you are yeah we have to we don't have to take anything the devil wants amen yes sir brother praise the lord so true amen reminds me of that story brother brad i'm told where he went to that lady with that medium and she lifted the table up off the floor and said i challenged anybody to put that table on the floor men got up and shoved on it pushed on it table wouldn't move and she said i challenge anybody you come up and said he would do it he said go right ahead he said in the name of the holy catholic pope and it stayed right there in the name of father son the holy ghost has stayed right there but he said in the name of the lord jesus christ and that table cracked down to the ground so hard like broke the legs praise the lord amen that's the lord that's that's the power and prayer power in the name of jesus amen yeah praise the lord anybody else you have songs micah had a song you wanted to sing amen um this thing this song came on my heart last week because i know there are several people whether it's financial or in body or in mind that are sick or not well um and on the lines that our pastors spoke that sometimes we're provided by the things we do by our hands by the choices we make um and this song came from my mind killing my heart um along those lines and so if you know it feel free to sing the words will be up um and i hope it's a blessing to you [Music] waiting there for 38 years he cried so long he ran out of tears just a worn-out man looking for a healing hand then one day his chance came along a healing man who could make him strong and he caught his eyes but his question took him by surprise [Music] are you willing to take up your mat and help yourself [Music] [Music] well [Music] you ever tried to fix yourself and every time you got up you [Music] and are you so attached to your pain you're afraid of heart we'll ask god for a brand new [Laughter] wanna be heart are you willing to take up your mat and help yourself do you wanna be free [Music] there's [Music] amen are you willing to take up your mat and help yourself [Music] [Laughter] [Music] well if you want to be healed you've gotta wanna be worse [Music] [Applause] amen so very true amen praise the lord i love that story in the bible and of course i enjoy that song too and micah sings it i think it has quite a meaning to it praise the lord amen god bless you again we are running a little bit late but i appreciate your patience we just want to turn the service now to the reading of the word so let's all stand if we could amen glad to have each one of you appreciate again being here as part of the service today it's so good to see you brother charlie amen missed you brother very much amen so thankful the lord blessed to be able to come and be with us today praise the lord we're gonna go back to saint john again uh try to pick up where we left off from last week if we could and saint john chapter three everybody comfortable anybody cool warm amen wow that's pretty tough to please this many people at one time praise the lord saint john chapter 3 we'll begin reading um verse 13 again if we could but before we read the word we just bow our heads for another word of prayer and father god we're so thankful again today of all that you've done for us lord god i just feel like my lord my heart's a full today god and seeing the church full and looking forward father to the fellowship lord if you would terry and god just spending time together and enjoying the beautiful natural food father that these uh people have prepared for us lord and god would just thank you that you've prepared us with a spiritual meal now and i pray god is i slaved over my stove yesterday god that you would speak to my heart and that you would use me to speak to your people because we are all needy today father lord we're just praying that you would anoint these lips anoint our ears and let it be accomplished what should have to be done today father truly in our lives lord we surrender all that we have to you so hard to do god because it grates against the human flesh greats against our spirit to surrender all to you but we know lord and recognizes born-again holy ghost-filled christians as the only way that we're ever going to get anywhere with you lord is to surrender our lives and to surrender our everything to you lord our will and our abilities and our thoughts and everything god is in your hands let it be manipulated let it be changed let it be lord made and molded into your perfect will whatever that might be for every one of us lord i pray that you bless this service lord and reigning part of it we rebuke every demonic spirit of hell that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the honor of the praise for all that is said and done help me lord insufficient as i am god lord i you know how i labored my mind lord in my heart and my spirit to lord get to the place that this this could uh come to my heart real and and bring it in a way lord that it would be revealed to each one of us and then you showed me that it's not based on my ability it's based on you lord so lord as it is spoken today may you reveal it to us as you have through your word through your prophet that god we would receive today the truth of what you have for us in our lives well thank you father for all of it and pray that your holy spirit would have preeminence once again now in the lovely precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen amen saint john chapter 3 verse 13 no math has ended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed on in the name of the only begotten son of god this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god you could be seated if you'd like amen i'm gonna continue this so this would be i guess who am i part two the men of those who may have been here last week or streaming last week uh we'll just continue with this part on uh who am i this would be part two we started out this uh with saint john chapter three one of the more familiar scripture readings that we have of the scripture at least it is for me because like i said last week i grew up in a baptist church and as you go to a sunday school in a baptist church first set of the first uh uh a scripture that they teach you that you have to learn that you have to quote and and and uh my heart is is john 3 16 for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son see it it worked my whole life from seven eight years old i could quote that scripture and i can quote it today i don't have to read it i know exactly what it says right so it worked amen the only thing is that it took god to bring it into my heart and change my life that's where the difference is amen but uh verse 15 again is the thing i want to focus on the most today and i'm not going to background very much and i'm going to try to keep it as short as possible i don't want to wear you out and and i know our bodies get tired and uh kind of had a rough thirsty well-rinsed thursday tuesday wednesday thursday friday myself and uh we were pretty busy yesterday and this morning uh but uh but god gives us strength and i'm so thankful for that his and his anointing is here i feel his presence amen brother john you feel that presence john couldn't hardly sing that last song amen praise the lord so amen amen we know the spirit of god is here but i want to focus again on that 15th verse that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life and again to get to that point of eternal life is what we're talking about because if we're wanting to and we're expecting to have eternal life we've got to understand or there's got to be that revelation that there's only one form of eternal life and it's not you and it's not me it's not our spirit it's not our it's not our flesh it's it's that part of god who we who god saw us before the foundation of the world because the only thing that's eternal is god god is the only form of eternity that there is so if he's the only form of eternity that there is then only those that came from god or a part of god are the ones that are eternal and only that part of god that came from god is eternal yeah so we got to this part that we went to last week and i've done this many uh many times the church i don't know that we'll be uh touching on it very much sorry sister norma we kind of have a range of people around from point to point it would probably be better i guess if it was on the wall i might do that anyway uh with our trial being uh our body spirit soul as you know uh many times in brother branham's early ministry he he kind of uh would equate the body spirit soul and in different ways he would uh he would just uh mention body soul spirit body spirit soul soul spirit body that kind of thing but when brother branham broke it down to teaching the actuality of what is uh what the human is made up of he broke it down to the body first we see of course the spirit and then the soul soul is the innermost man the wheel inside the wheel the innermost being is the soul who is really you spirit is just the life of the body and the body of course that we see is that's the pretty that's pretty easy part but down inside the soul now that's the real you that's who you really are is that part that god before the foundation of the world put in there as a soul a person that would live on that would continue on after this body uh had deceased that that soul would continue to live on and that's the real you that's who you really are but that seed that god placed down in there is that part of who god is and who you really are is that seed the seed of god now let's go back to first john and and uh read in the scripture there again as we left that off with last week first john chapter 3 not saint john but first john chapter 3. i prayed yesterday and well always pray but i sitting right where brother john said and i was asking the lord some better way lord that that i i feel so insufficient but a way to be able to relate that uh to us to be able to see that because it's hard i i recognize i i'm not a very intelligent person but i can recognize that if i have a difficult time grasping something then most other people probably do too yeah so when it's something that's like that in my spirit and i i in my spirit feel insufficient in sharing that i asked the lord for help he's always asking for help anyway but you know there's just some things that you that's just challenging to get across to understand or to to have that revelation of and sometimes it just takes that little thing to click to bring that revelation to your heart right amen and that's that's what the lord does sometimes the lord will just drop a revelation to you but usually it's something that's spoken because the word brings faith preaching of the word brings faith faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god so what many times when that word comes and that word is spoken just a certain way or a certain time or something would just click in that revelational comments it's just the nature of the holy spirit that reveals that work to us that that brings it and make it known to us so it becomes a part of us so after that part there's no denying that revelation it just becomes a part of who you are amen so uh talking to the lord about that because to get us to the place to understand this is not us this body is not us this spirit is not uh it's not the real you again those are just houses that god houses in well the house is the body the spirit's just the life of the body uh the the the imagination constant reason fixed uh affection memory it's just the spirit it's just the life of the body but the real you is what's down on the inside of the inside the eternal part and that's the part again from last week i want to focus on again today is that eternal part if we expect and believe to have eternal life then we have to come to the recognized recognition of who we really are hence the title who am i who we really are who we really are is not flesh it's a representation of god because of the spirit that's now living within us but the real us is down on the inside of the inside that part that came from god that's who we really are the part that came from god in this country i'm going to try to make it a little plainer it helped me yesterday anyway you know in the united states we have something like patent law uh brother peter mcfadden is a patent lawyer now we have things called patents that if it's something that you've made or manufactured you can put a patent on that in this country and nobody else can duplicate that widget without your permission it's yours we have what's called intelligent uh intellectual property you've ever heard of that we have what's called intellectual property in this country so if it's something that was a thought or an idea or usually it's used for a book intellectual property a lot of times is used for a manuscript or a book if somebody wrote a book and had original thoughts those thoughts put in paper you have a uh what is an intellectual property that that says in this country if you go to the court and say this is my book and i've got this copyright and this this is my intellectual property that means that nobody else can take it from you nobody else can duplicate it nobody else is even supposed to repeat it without your permission now people obviously do all the time but they're not supposed to rewrite it uh that's called perjury right there are uh uh plagiarism they're not supposed to uh repeat it they're not supposed to use it for any personal gain because it's your intellectual property it came from your spirit it came from your thoughts it came from your mind so even though it's out here it belongs to you in this country it's considered a part of you amen i i i well the lord helped me write a book that that book is copyrighted in that book is intellectual property that god gave to me that dropped in my mind the spirit that i put on that book and so nobody can take that and replicate it without my permission legally people do it of course but legally they're not supposed to take that book and preach on it legally without my permission now they can i don't care they're welcome to do that all they want but they they're not legally supposed to without asking my permission because that book is a part of me you understand where i'm going even though the book is over it on my desk or in a printer somewhere or in a computer somewhere it's my intellectual property so it belongs to me it's an extension of me i hope we can grab you you see where i'm going with this we are the intellectual property of god even though we're out from him per se in his thoughts our minds brother adam always said we're the thoughts of god attribute of god you're an attribute of god that's an easy way to put it it's an easy way to understand it to say that we were in the mind of god we were the thoughts of god we were an attribute of god well saints if we were a thought of god and god took that thought and expressed it down inside you in the form of a germ seed of life then that's still god's intellectual property that still belongs to god that is as much a part of god as if you were standing here in a corporal body right now right now it's still just as much a part of god now as it was then because god took that and he put it down i put my thoughts in a book on paper god took his thoughts and he put them in you and in you and in you and in you and in you and if you're streaming he put it in each one of his own predestinated children that's why that becomes who we really are god's intellectual property because we belong to him that's who you really are amen not not this uh person uh born in the bennett family and and and the things that god give me in the stature and my look and my ethnicity and all that no that's just a part of who this house is but who i really am is on the inside of the inside that germ seed that god put in before the foundation of the world very much that's who we really are yes god's intellectual property praise the lord that's wonderful amen it's just the thoughts of god think about this i mentioned this the other day last sunday you know i got a couple of extensions of myself here my son newton jr or we called him micah uh my daughter there's extensions they came from me well let's go on the script before we go to first john let's go to let's go to hebrews amen i'm just trying to follow the lord it's it's not following the path i was expecting but let's go to hebrews hebrews chapter 7. maybe we can nail this down just a little more scripturally hebrews chapter 7 verse 1 for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth of all abraham tied to god no cassidy abraham tithed to melchizedek amen to god first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life and again that just blows that baffles me but may like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now consider how great this man unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of his of his spoils of his of the spoil and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of priesthood of the priesthood have a commandment to take ties of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises you see how this is all intertwined together amen just like god and his family it's it's all intertwined together we're all we're all uh we're all an extension of that very thing amen we always talk about brother tom mentioned in his prayer of getting together with those of like precious faith the scripture tells us basically what it is it's a family gathering right we got a little portion of a family reunion going on here because we all came from the same daddy we all came from the same papa we were all of the thoughts of god expressed in these flesh bodies that we're sitting here today with yes amen look at this now and without all contradiction the less is better uh less is blessed the better and here men that die receive tithes but there they uh he receiveth them of whom is witness that he liveth and as it and as i may so say levi also who received tithes paid tithes in abraham levi it was accounted in the mind of god in the recognition of god it was accounted to levi to that paid tithes to melchizedek which abraham did because abraham because levi was still yet in the loins of abraham praise the lord amen amen you you see how just even in the natural and my loins existed my son my daughter my grandson sitting there amen yeah you see through that extension how god even attributed it to levi empantized to melchizedek through abraham that lineage well if that extends in the natural what does it do in the spiritual god himself you're just that extension you're just that one that came from the loins of god almighty that came from his thoughts his you're an attribute of his expressed here praise the lord amen and there's no way that my son could deny that i am his father all right no way right he could change his name he could go to the course and get emancipated of course he's 31. now he's not just a little late for that but he could go to the courts as a young man and emancipated himself legally for me being his daddy but all you got to do is a little a little swab of my saliva and his and you'll find out i'm his papa no denying it right do the blood test they call it of course dna today but you're doing blood tests you'll find out real quick he's my son amen what did the scripture say what did brother branham say do the word test give them the word test and you'll find out real quick whether they belong to god or not yes you'll find out very fast you just do a little test do a blood test because his royal blood now flows through my veins just do a little blood test a little word test and you'll find out real fast who i belong to there won't be any denying it used to be a day when i did deny him i didn't want to have anything to do with him but i still belong to him because that seed was still in there it was always in there always been in there i've had people challenge me said oh it was it was put there when you were born again it was put there when you received the word it was put there someone said no no no not according to the scripture and not according to the message right of course the message is just an extension of the scripture right amen it was always there that's who i always was right i never was a dog turned into a cat i never was a mule turned into a a horse i was oh i never i never was a wheat turned into a tear or vice versa i was always a son or daughter of god i was always this seed in you you were always this always no matter where you were going how much you denied it what you tried to get away from it that made no difference you belong to god then you belong to god now that's why that jesus said all the father hath given me will come and satan cannot remove one from the bottom of my head can't do it because we belong to him why do we belong to him because we have eternal life how do we have eternal life because we are him that seed is him that seed is you well if it's you and him it's like people try to chop god up into three pieces they try to make him a father and then a son and a holy ghost and you got the trinity going on which is not scriptural at all and they got god chopped up into three pieces and and god's the one and the jesus the son and the holy spirit and and and brother random come and said well now the bible says in many places that god is the father of jesus jesus himself said and then you go and you find out when when mary conceived that she was conceived of who the holy ghost was you split these two up what did you got you got an illegitimate religion friend you got a mess if you try to chop god in the holy ghost into two different pieces and then the sun out here you chop them all up then what have you got some illegitimate but when the when god and the holy ghost are the self-sane person then it's it's very simple amen well when you've got the holy spirit and that seed of god is the self-saying person what have you got well if that that seed is you and that seed came from god then what have you got amen self same person yes amen it's hard for us to recognize i know your flesh gets in the way saints i understand that because it does me too it wants to make me doubt all the time satan wants to point out every mistake i made every failure that i made everything that i said wrong every thought that i said wrong you know satan will drop a nasty filthy thought into your mind and and keep it long enough in there to convince you it was your thought you'll be repenting for a thought that god that satan put in there that you had nothing to do with you cast that devil out and let god take preeminent in that thought and then that's the then that lays on the head of satan not you amen amen what did brother greene say he said as soon as you can get a hold of yourself right or brother adam told him that right as soon as you can come to yourself soon as you can get a hold of yourself say god i don't want to be that way i'm not like that lord forgive me i'm sorry you got to go to somebody and make it right with them apologize to them or whatever then you make that right and then you move on and that's that's the christian way of doing it yeah i'm going to say something i wasn't going to and i'm not preaching this as doctor but as i was praying the lord yesterday and just so many things was coming to me i i started thinking god is is is repentance for us i mean think about it if this is who you are and this is who you always have been if this seed is who you are and it's who you always have been forgiveness is already inherent you're already forgiven right jesus hung at calvary and said it is finished the work of the the work of forgiveness is done repentance is for us amen it's not for him it's for us it's for us to recognize who we are to give us faith to help us recognize lord i'm sorry we make a mistake see god gave us an avenue to be able to reach that place in our hearts and in our spirits that we recognize god has forgiven us amen otherwise we'll just we'll just run around this earth as guilt-ridden people oh we'll just be a bunch of guilt-ridden people unless god gave us an avenue god gave us a vehicle to unload all that guilt to unload all that oppression and all that weight sin is a weight you know that right you sin and sin will weigh you down it keeps you so weighed down and like mike is saying people get so comfortable in those places they get so comfortable living in that sin they get so comfortable living in that sickness any attention and all those things they get so comfortable like that they don't even want out anymore but there's there god provided a vehicle for us to lift that off of us the fact of the matter is if this is you it's you then it's you now always will be you that's established that's finished there's no debate or question to that if you came as an attribute a part of god you are now you always will be you came from eternity and you're going to eternity i don't know any other better way to say it brother graham says beginning many times i say beginning many times but friend there never was a beginning it never began it just always was if he always was you always were you came from him and forgiveness repentance is a vehicle god gave us how we recognize of course that we've faults and mistakes is a vehicle to unload all that to get that off of our spirits to get rid of that and answer that it doesn't burden you anymore so that you can have the faith that you need to be the type of christian and godly person with that experience in your life that you need to be what would you be without it well i'm just so and so and such and such no you're not amen no you're not but as i said last week but i'm not just a sinner saved by grace either i love that song like i told you last week i i really enjoyed that song the gates are singing just as sinners say by grace i like it but the truth of it is if you are truly a son of god from the beginning a seed of god you always work you're the predestinated thought of god not just a sinner saved by his grace yeah we are sinners saved by his grace but not just a sinner saved by grace we were always this we were always that seed we're that part of god that god put in these flesh bodies so that that exists because it is give them the word test you'll find out who they are real quick yes amen if they'll stand on that word brother braham said even if that they stand on that message of the hour you give them the word test you'll find out whether they really are or not give them a dna test give my children a dna test you'll find out real quick they belong to me they're my papa i'm their pop and they can't deny that no matter how much or how legal they try to do it doesn't matter they belong to me amen so many people we look friends uh they try to deny it sometimes but you just can't do it in the loins of abraham just like levi was in the loins of abraham by paying tithes to melchizedek it's just an extension of him praise the lord just an extension we're an extension of god that's simply to simply put we are the extensions of god yes we are if we're his children if we're the predestinated of god if we're the four known of god from the thoughts of god that we are his intellectual property he we belong to him because we're part of him not because we repented not because we came to an altar not because we accepted him or not said he's my savior not even because you become born again i won't get to it today i got a quote in here it tells you that's just a temporal gift from god the holy spirit amen we'll try to explain that later but that's exactly what he said but what it boils down to is this was always you first john let's go to first john again now let's find this seed again not saint john now first john first john chapter well we'll just start with verse one again praise the lord mine i tell you what that it just that just does something to me amen when you when you hear when you read the bible talk about it you hear brother brown and preach about it or something anyhow there's preach it it it it does something to you but my when it just becomes such a revelation and drops down in your heart right that really like i said last week brother adam said if this flesh were to drop off you see god standing in front of you right why because that seed came to life because of the holy spirit coming in there that that's that's exactly why that when you're born again and that the holy spirit comes into your soul and god seals that spirit in that soul and there's nothing can get in or nothing can get out you know you talk about i'm i want to go here people talk about and brother brown did about getting a refilling a refilling of the spirit what is that refilling friends if you've been born again and the holy spirit of god has took over residence of your soul and when that life met that seed life it brought life amen when it's sealed in there nothing can get in and nothing can get out right now until it gets to its destination then where is the refilling that we get that guy is settled right that soul man is done he's sealed until his destination that's scripture ephesians 1 12 i believe or 14 something like that that that's done so where's the refeeling coming to it's his spirit of an anointing upon the body and the spirit because the soul is completely it's already sealed the soul seal god's god's not still just pouring more of his spirit in there no what we need is more of his life to take over our spirit and our bodies so that we live and act and do more like christ every day amen his spirit upon us that anointing that fresh refilling of an anointing upon us i know that's not salvation but that's also the vehicle which god give us to fill his presence in our lives amen that anointing that comment falls that that fell today this year now you may feel it now that that anointing that's on you amen praise it that's a that's a refeeling that god comes and anoints once again soul sealed it's sealed till it's destination amen no changing that brother and said he's sealed and sealed in nothing get in nothing get out he talked about the train car mentioned before here a couple weeks ago man talked about the train car where uh when it when it was packed right and everything was exactly the way it was supposed to be and everything was supposed to be in it's in it the inspector would come by he would look in the train car to make sure everything was packed right everything was supposed to be in it's in it he'd close the door and he put a seal on that door and there was nobody gonna change or break that seal until that train got to his destination right until that box car got through this that's the type of brother bannon was typing of the sealing of the holy spirit in our lives amen that anointing that that refilling first john chapter 3 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god amen now we read last week uh galatians uh one that says because we are sons amen because we are children amen now john's saying that we should be called the sons of god and remember in process of adoption remember process of adoption there's relationship in adoption and there's placement in adoption relationship is like we know in this world in this country relationship is you belong to somebody's family and another family's adopting you into their family and now that's a relationship you're a son now amen but a placement's a different thing where do you fit in that family what part do you play what are you supposed to accomplish or add to that family now that you're a part of it right amen adoption of a child of god is not a an adoption of relationship because if you are a son you are always a son amen you were never not a son again pardon the double negative but you were never not a son just like the prodigal son he said never not a son you're always a son so if adoption is not a matter of relationship then what is it a matter of placement where do you fit what is your part right who are you it's like i said last week it's hard to fathom in this world today but it's become so prominent especially among young people me and john went over uh mary gave us this little stand uh it was a client of mine and sonya's now helping her pack she's moving but anyway we were over there and picking a couple things up that i'd left over there and uh and we were talking about that and and that uh and that relationship in in that in that manner see to to to understand what what is it that is the number one killer of young people today themselves i think it's 15 and younger the number one cause of death among 15 and younger is killing their their own cells suicide number one thing and it boggles the mind to believe how anybody especially in this country of plenty quote unquote this uh godly country quote unquote how people could get to the place that they that they believe that the unknown which most people have no clue what is going to happen when they die most people are scared of it they're they're more they're less afraid of the unknown than what the uh the possibilities are in this life and they kill themselves for different reasons but that's what it boils down to whether they're being bullied or whether they're being ignored or whether they're whatever the situation maybe they're trying to impress a girlfriend or i don't know but pretty extreme to impress a girl but anyway uh it does happen but uh but the unknown is more attractive to them than what they can do and accomplish here what they can see and touch and smell it's it's just hard to believe but that's the number one killer among young people coal that isn't even in the top 20 or 25 or something it's just it is way low on the totem pole number one is suicide number one is suicide and it's gaining steam too amen the more these kids are dictated to and throw masks on all day long just losing their identities and all that they're trying to grow up to to to do and to live and and to search for and find some identity in their lives they lose it amen they lose it and and and without that what do you have and the poor kids are crippled from children they're crippled it's sad but anyway call the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god so that's relationship it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is every man that had this hope in him purified himself even as he is pure whosoever committed sin we don't get into the sin thing again but this goes along with the thought i had about sin amen we mentioned last week a fifth verse a fourth verse who whosoever committed sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sin and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither known him little children that no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil now remember where is that committed of sin come from because there's a difference he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil's sentence from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil or sin or unbelief amen jesus came that he would destroy the unbelief that's why he said in john 3 15 16 if you believe amen now that's believe unto receiving that's believe unto becoming not just believe satan believes amen right he knows very well god exists he knows very well that jesus is the son of god he knows all that very well believeth unto receiving becoming amen you receive that for that purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy those works whosoever is born of god does not commit sin does not commit sin if you are born of god you do not sin that's the scripture you can say it however you want you can believe it however you want but that's what the bible says now what again what part of you does not sin because we know that we make mistakes in this flesh all the time every day we do things wrong all the time every day so what part of you cannot sin that's soul because that's where the birth takes place said do i enter in my mother's womb the second time he didn't have a revelation but to have a revelation of what the new birth is which you won't hear about out in the world hardly anymore and the world christendom doesn't preach about the new birth anymore sometimes you don't even hardly hear it in message churches but without that new birth you will be here when the rapture's gone am i whether foolish virgin or just flat unbeliever doesn't matter well it does matter but uh you know what i'm saying if you're not a believer though if that if you're not born again you're going to be left here right because that's the ticket that's the token the holy spirit is the token without that you're going to be left here that's right so when that life comes in and that seal is sealed in there it burned out that old nature he burned out as ephesians 2 burned out that old desire because you were of nature by nature what is that nature brother graham said the nature is of the nature of the spirit is the soul the nature so if that nature if that old nature is burned out by the holy ghost and fire and burns out the old nature then you have no more desire to sin right there's no more sin in this in the man the soul there's no more desire for sin none you those the things of the world all those things they're they've all gone away they're not they're no longer a part of who you really are now these things that we have the constant affection reason memory that all affects our bodies see case fill smell here and those things are affected by that and those things they do trip up and they do make mistakes and they do list the things they say shouldn't say or say things they shouldn't say act in ways and our emotions and our spirit gets the best of us sometimes we get angry when we shouldn't be right we say something that we shouldn't say that's in here not your soul that's the mistakes you make here and that's why god give us that vehicle that when we've done that and there's a conscience in here now that says you've done wrong then you can take that and that vehicle god gave us first john 1 9 and say i'm sorry lord yes and he said i forgive you amen if you confess your sin he is just and faithful to forgive you of your sin amen then that weight is lifted off of you that sin no longer accounted to you the man said he puts it on the head of satan where it lays till the day of judgment praise god that's the best place i can think of for it because it was his to begin with right amen was never mind to begin with it was his and he can have it back and he can be accountable for it at the white throne judgment and cast in hell for it amen because i'm justified i never did it to begin with praise the lord amen that's your god's soul god see taking over whosoever is born of god does not sin for his whose not brother branham's not the popes not some great minister or some great evangelist or some pastor amen not brother rap not brother greens glomscene amen amen his poncy remaineth in you remain it again what does that word remaineth me doesn't mean it was put there today that you were that you were born again or come to an offer accepted jesus no remaineth means it wasn't put there it was always there and it's still there and it remains there that's what remain means and if you have any questions about that i don't think you do i've been challenged about it before not here uh back in north carolina i've been challenged about that before i don't know how brother brown makes it very clear thinking man's filter let's look at this i'll close here sometime today thank you man's filter uh quote 108. notice that word cannot deny itself again word test yes praise the lord it is satisfied or is desired desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because what made you desired in the first place remember you're the four known predestinated of god amen you are the four known predestinated of god for known just means he knew you back then he knows all things beginning i don't say beginning from the beginning to the end to him there is no beginning because from the beginning to the end he knows all things so if he knows that it's in the mind of god this is just the four no he for new you he predestinated you based on who you would be and where you would live and what house you grew up in and what state you'd be born in and what family you would have and all those things god predestinate the gifts you might have the gift of god the things that those are all predestination is predestination by poor knowledge you are the predestination of the god now because down in your soul reading the quote again here now because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life listen always laying in there always laying in there the predestinated seed of eternal life was always in there all the way he says it twice always was in there praise the lord now how somebody in this message contradicting that could come up with something different as well that's their choice i choose not to because it matches the scripture right amen no i don't just take brother branham's word for it friend i find in the bible where it says amen i haven't found him wrong yet and i don't think i will but it's in the bible remaineth there brother brown said always in there and he doesn't just say it this one time he says it several times always in there all the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost praise god for that friend if you need to help in some faith in some way for a loved one or a lost loved one or a child or something you hold on to that because they belong to you they're of your lineage if they belong to you they belong to him and if you are his they are his you claim them and believe that just like you do for your own salvation amen are you saved yes are you yes then they are no questions don't let the devil make you doubt or believe anything else yes you understand don't let that devil try to get you to believe anything else i don't care where they are i don't care what they're doing i don't care what they're going through i don't care what kind of life they're living makes no difference in many ways i was that person back then myself right but i never was really that person i've always been this person praise god amen amen so you hold on to that none of them are going to be lost yes praise the lord a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of god my sheep hear my voice says strangers though not father i follow for down in there is life down in there is and life connects with the light so what is that that's the life that was in there the seed of god that lay dormant and the spirit of god the holy spirit coming in life needs life and when the life meets the life what does it do well it produces life a life that's now living in you the life that is now controlling you because it is who you are at one time that seed was dormant because of that old nature in there but when that which came in because of the fault of the garden but when that got burned out the holy spirit came that life met that life all there is is life now there is no darkness there is no doubt it's all life because that life brought life bringing it to life oh can't you do the natural types of spiritual friend when there's there's a seed that can lay in there and can lay dormant for years but when it gets in the right conditions the water the sun when life comes to that seed it brings life and what was ever in that seed will produce of itself look at this that seed from first john i'll read this again i did last week from last week this seed the greek of this seed the grain or kernel which contains within itself the germ of future plans praise the lord amen that's what it was with abraham and levi that's exactly what it is scripture it's exactly what it is god you me that's exactly what that seed that was in there all that seed contained was what the life was in it for future plants or for future life amen well if you got if you got the if there's a seed of a dog in there what's it going to produce not a cat it's going to produce a dog and it's not going to be one sell a dog and next sell a cat and next sell a horse and an excellent goat or a next celery it's going to be all dog it's going to be sell sell on sell on sell on selling it's going to be a dog right it's going to look like a dog if that's if that seed in there is a is a an orange seed then it's going to produce an orange tree but if that seed in there is the seed of god god's intellectual property that he dropped in you if it's his seed what's he going to produce amen that's all it can produce because the seed can only produce the life that's in it praise the lord amen the divine energy here's another the divine energy operating within the soul by which we are regenerated born again made new no longer the creature we were but a new creature in christ jesus old things are passed away behold all things have become new amen i might still be the same other young guy i've always been but inside something changed exactly i i may have told you this months ago or at some point in time i remember when i did my sister's funeral uh she passed in 2003 she passed 2003 cancer and she had a pretty full funeral in north carolina there was one old friend i remember her from way back in high school man they ran together had fast cars and guys and they did all kinds of stuff things that i don't even want to mention or even think of but they weren't good people and i remember she came to the funeral and she got up and i i can't remember she testified or she told me personally but she said this is not the janice i knew this was a different person the genus i knew was a completely different individual this is not this not this the the the woman that was laying in that casket of course that wasn't her anyway was a different person it was not hers she said something happened to her along her life's journey that changed her from who she was now she looked exactly the same it just got old but what changed on the inside made everything on the outside change right that's why we're and and that's one of the things that the devil uses against us too the devil uses that against you how many times do you think the devil has come and tried to whisper in your ear and you think you're a child of god no tell me satan he never tried to tell you that amen if he hadn't you're probably not one i guarantee you god satan at some point it's common space you got age on us like most of us and said oh you think you're and see what you did see what you did get you get you all and then all of a sudden you downed it down the dolphins to get condemn you when god is there to liberate you and set you free because you didn't fall from this you can't hear me now if if if this is you if this seed this soul that life is really you you cannot fall from it impossible you cannot okay amen no matter what you did what mistake you made what life you lived before now that doesn't excuse sin right that doesn't give you the right to just do whatever you want to do that just proves who you really are amen that's a good way to explain predestination that just proves who you are if you say well i'm predestined i just do whatever i just proves what's in you and who you really are see but if you're the true seed of god that life is going to produce itself let me close with this quote here i still haven't got to that other thing i wanted to get to last week this is also thinking men's filter just a few um quotes down he said oh my there is that real filtration of all the sin of the world the love of the world is dead and this soul is drawing only on one thing this soul is drawing only on one thing remember that's the free will amen the the free will that you have is in the soul you got ck spill smelling here it's in the body you got a ma imagination constant infection reason memory in the spirit but the soul is drawing on that one thing because there's free will in there that's that and that that's the seed of god it's only drawing on one thing here it is don't forget it brother graham said all you out on the telephone set this down in your mind when a thinking man begins to think who he's going to stand before and what the word of god is he begins to think when he draws through that there's nothing to get through it but the holy ghost amen the holy ghost which is what that germ-seed word from the beginning that logos germ seed word logos from the beginning that was there in god that's god that just came out of god that logos had just come out of god that intellectual property that just came out of god at that real germ seed word and if it's that germ seed word that's living in there look what he said now that uh that you was in god at the beginning standing here drawing that sea life the seed is in your heart by four nations predestination hallelujah he says the seed is already in there by the foreknowledge of god predestinated and it draws through that holy spirit that word that predestinated word seed life it draws through that because it can't draw through nothing else but the word that's all it can draw through the thinking man's filter you remember the thinking man's filter brother ma'am talked about the scripture being that thinking man's filter what's going to get through here a thinking man won't sin i think he man won't try to shove cigarettes through here because it won't go because that's contrary to the word it's contrary to the spirit of god he can't shove gambling through here won't go it's got to be the holy spirit it's got to be from that word german seed life from the beginning you can't take a baptist doctrine and try to shove it through here it won't go right a catholic methodist whatever you some message doctrines they won't go through here because they're not the word right well they might have a quote or two they might have even a scripture to but unless it's ordained by the holy spirit it will not go through this filter that's that germ-seed light that seed that was down in there praise the lord amen we call to see actually if that holy spirit has come in there and taking control over that soul it's no longer a seed it's a life when a seed is brought to life it's no longer a seed it's whatever the life that was in the seed that's conformed amen so what is it controlling your life today what is it controlling our lives who are we really what's controlling you who is in there it'll manifest itself on the outside what are your desires get the word test you'll find out real quick very much do they decide the world more or do they put god first in their life do they desire to draw off of the things of the world or they desire to draw off the things of god it'll tell real quick i'm not i'm not telling you not to live your life or have hobbies and things that's not what i'm talking about but when something becomes more important to you than god there's a red flag right amen i'm not saying you're not born again but that's a red flag all right you start to examine yourself and if that continues on like that and there's nothing checked or done about it then i would really question because if you if you're a child of god and you begin to put something before god things aren't going to go right god will speak to you and say you've got to remove this from your life remember we talked about elijah when god sent elijah down the chair he had to do some cutting on elijah because too much of elijah was living too much of elijah's spirit and will was still prevalent and god had to cut that out of it he had to send him to zarephath and refine him because two chapters later he was about to have the greatest showdown on earth on mount carmel all right 400 opponents and all the devils of hell around praise the lord amen he called down the fire of god at that point because he'd been cut refined he called down the fire of god that licked up the wood the stones the sacrifice and everything else wasn't a bit of it left it got so embarrassing for those prophets they began to cut themselves just like it is the natural the nature of a of an unbeliever it's a heathen trait amen it's a heathen trait to cut yourself like that that's why this tattooing stuff they cut themselves that's how you know where you get that ink in your body amen this is a demonic spirit it wasn't of god it's against the word it was in it is now it's a trait it's a heathen trait amen and the sad thing is there's churches out there that are promoting it as being okay man as soon as that place moved in next door i put my hands on that wall and i god you're out of here i told god i don't know how many times i was 20 30 times over there i said god if there's no spiritual purpose for those people being here get them out now amen amen less than two months they were gone gone and left everything over there thank you lord it's like i came in here on wednesday night when we had brother uh i think it was that night we had brother benny perry in and i came in people were here came out of service they were gone hadn't seen him since amen that's the power of god saints we either believe it or we don't i believe it amen praise the lord we got to know who we are and i believe that's what catches the that's what catches a rapture too right he met brother graham said when this bride comes to know who she is he means she can do the greater work since nothing can stand before hers right nothing can stand before who you the bride amen praise the lord you say nothing can stand before god well what have we been preaching amen god help us help us to live this life up to that standard amen amen let's stand if we could amen who are we really who has god made us who has god predestinated us to be amen that's what we that's what we should all desire to be it's what god predestinated us to me yes amen praise the lord let's sing this little course i've just seen the course part at least i think 665 i don't have it on the excuse me i apologize we don't have it on the tablet it's 665 in the psalm but most of us probably know it though child of the king i'm a child of the king most of us probably know that anyway amen we're just seeing the chorus here 6 65 if you got a book with you there oh yes oh [Music] his yes blood thou flows through my veins [Music] can sing praise god praise god i'm a child of the king oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king and his royal blood now flows through [Music] praise god [Music] oh yes [Music] [Music] who was [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god i'm a child of the king hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord you believe that today at your inheritance amen that's your lineage yes that's who you are praise god amen i know this adoption's that relationship being a son amen but that helps us recognize who god's made us to be right amen heirs of god joint heirs with christ praise the lord jesus i'm so thankful god so good to us isn't he amen my i just love with all my heart you better believe that we believe that today because god's faithful to that to us amen he's done his part it's up to us to believe some people say oh brother you you just gone too far now you call us god friend sometimes i don't think we go far enough that's right that's right to realize what is in us who are we really [Music] praise the lord it's the only way we're going to be able to make it yes it's on the way we're going to be able to prove who we really are it's the only way it's going to manifest itself because that's what it really is yeah it's only going to manifest what it is because of who it is yes amen praise the lord i love you with all my heart amen don't you praise god god's been so good to us amen just a moment um a couple things now i need to mention we're going to have the the dinner next door now um most of it's all set up there'll be a few things to do you'll notice when you go in if you haven't already that we haven't set up the tables to sit at and the tape we've got the one table where the plates the silverware and the main dishes the side dishes desserts and then the drinks uh on the other side over there i'm thinking hopefully that unless we just get an over abundance of food which is okay by me uh in case we get we just put that in my table but we just if we do we can just make another table uh to put it on also sister pat brought some plants she had dug up for a contribution if you want one uh because and she wants all the contributions of that to go to uh i guess what mike and my wife have started a uh a fund a a uh i guess fundraiser i i don't like that that makes me feel like i'm back and teaching school again um really i mean how many cars did we watch fundraiser god provides amen but like i said wednesday sometimes god the provision god is through our hands praise the lord god provided us this place amen but if he didn't provide us to be able to pay for it he'd kick us out next month so amen our hand so anyway so there's a jar next to the plants and it's for contributions to make towards our sound system as you know or most of you do the sound system is not ours it's brother roger collins so we got we need to give it i need to give it back to him sometime he doesn't need it right now but i don't want to just keep it like our possession so we want to we want to get our own uh equipment things so where it's it gets a little expensive i don't mind paying for it like i do so many of the things that's okay but when it gets into that type of finance it's it's a little more challenging so anyway so the jars there for and sister pat the plants if you're going to take one and put the money just put the money in the jar because she's donating that to the church so amen and we're still working on the streaming if you've been streaming and you go back and look at the archives they're still not quite like we want them to be um i got another court to make an extension of that to make that look a little better but the extension didn't work it didn't read on the computer so it's just going to hang there for now like that i hope that's okay um i like things a little tidier than that but anyway we hardwired the camera so that we can make it work a little bit better the sound's a little uh still got a little staticky in it michael's working with the camera people to fix that and all so anyway just pray for us we just all that we try to do we do for the glory of the lord but so we'll have the meal next door just a moment so remember the prayer request though as i said the swanson's brother jim swanson most of you probably know him uh at least he's staying at harmony the last harmony we had uh he's got a very good voice he's he's a fine brother his daughter i believe her name's faith she got coveted or her husband got coveted and jim and her husband or i heard were uh really struggling with it i don't want to give any kind of medical i don't know but they were struggling with it so please remember them and as you all know uh write texts brother dave green greeny i always try to separate that uh people say was he related to brother no no brother perry's a green davis greedy there's an e on the end david dave green uh green e passed away this week so please remember sister chris the family joy christy angela and and all the family in prayer brother dave was quite a he was quite a presence uh he was uh he was very much uh a presence so and he was he was the matriarch a patriarch of that family was he was the he was a strong personality yeah that's what i'm looking for he was a very strong personality but like i said wednesday night uh i i don't have any uh arrangement uh knowledge yet i don't know what's gonna go on i i don't have any i don't know i'd like to go to the memorial if there is one we're all invited but uh because brother dave was very good to me when we first moved here uh it was just a real blessing and i i told you this testimony i'll say real quick not keep you standing so long but real quick when uh when we were here we me and dave were with some other people to function something he said you want to go get a steak you know me yeah um so he said go get a steak i said yes because i said stuff and i said yes so he took me over we went to little abner's on silverbelt really good uh steakhouse been here years but we got he and he ordered he ordered the two most expensive steaks on the menu there were 35 back in 2002. uh i don't know what they charged now but they were expensive big porterhouse big thick uh porterhouse steaks you ordered two of them and we were eating about halfway through or i can't remember this part but like halfway through or when he was paying the bill or something he told me he said this is my last hundred bucks and that's just what he did he took his last hundred dollars and bought me dinner he said i have no more money broke that's just the way dave green believed it i don't advocate that to you just go spend your last penny on something but did scriptural lady come and put in her the two mice and jesus said she put more in all the rest and all the millionaires too much half a cent you know to my sin was worth half a cent too much and it was worth more than all the rest right you mean because she gave up her substance she did all she had amen he gave all he had he later after that when i was in the mountains uh 2005 he became a multi-millionaire off the land of course then the real estate thing crashed but that's just kind of man he was he was a giving man he was uh he had a good heart i know he when he became rich again he bought cars for people he bought this big huge piano for love divine and grand piano he just you just that kind of person amen he lost all again that stopped in the real estate crash but uh but he never lost that spirit of that smile and uh he used to see harmony he used to sing at the tabernacle with brother green i thought him and brother green sounded good together actually too you know but anyway i just just a little memorial little testimony from my heart about how dave green affected my life and that's just a little bit of it but uh anyway i appreciate you indulge me for that but we'll go uh we'll go next door and have a meal and fellowship and i'm looking forward to it so uh if you came in a little late and your things are in here we'll just move them over so there'll be a little transition period uh getting some things set up and appreciate the zincas they gave us most of all those long tables and we had chairs and things so i certainly appreciate everything and all the efforts everybody's done amen so god reached the bless you for that sister matisse had a testimony real quick real quick um when i was before i was a christian i was pregnant with my first child and god spoke to me and said how many children do you want and i've never thought of it before and i told him what i wanted and the order that i wanted him and he gave them to me and many years later about 15 years later or something my children were going all different directions they've been in gone take the church my husband took him to a denominational church and one day a prophet spoke to me in a service he gave me everything in writing i still have it to this day and he said the denominations are after my children i always thought i always wondered if god only took the you know if this was a spiritual line that always went through the mail because that's what we've been taught the life goes through the mail god gave me those children he's the life he's the father and i want to just remind you you didn't make your children god made them amen but they belong to them i didn't verify what you were saying amen praise the lord god bless you love you all appreciate you so much wednesday night service seven o'clock still back uh the same but now we're gonna go i have a little natural food so amen god bless you thank you for coming brother charlie you mind praying for us and dismissing us and praying for the food bless everything lord god and thank you for that that we've had with you
