[26:42] she's having vein surgeries she's got
[26:45] four more I think you told me to go and
[26:48] she really sincerely covets our prayers
[26:52] so
[26:53] please continue to remember Sister joy
[26:55] hakami in prayer I've been praying for
[26:58] her for
[27:00] Faithfully for a while now since we
[27:03] first found out about her infirmity so
[27:06] we want to continue to remember her in
[27:08] prayer also sister Lydia's family
[27:12] sister Lydia and sister Lydia family not
[27:15] doing well they've been sick sick since
[27:18] last week since religious started
[27:20] getting better
[27:21] or the Ralph's starting to get it now
[27:25] one of the granddaughters
[27:27] Marissa just tested positive for strep
[27:31] so that whole family just kind of it's
[27:35] just kind of like the Hot Potato you
[27:36] know
[27:37] you try to get rid of the potato before
[27:40] it goes before it goes off so they just
[27:43] keep passing it around so please
[27:45] remember Sister Lydia and the family
[27:46] Lord would just touching them also got a
[27:48] text from Sister Sharia right before
[27:50] church started Arts back is still
[27:52] bothering him the strength he's got a
[27:56] very laborous job that he does he needs
[27:58] strength in his back he has to do his

[28:03] as well
[28:04] also micro rights request here says
[28:08] please remember me in your prayers
[28:09] regarding leadership of the Lord for
[28:12] what he wants me to do or what he has
[28:15] for me
[28:16] the other day I felt some sense of
[28:19] urgency towards changing jobs but I want
[28:21] to make sure that pull is from him and
[28:24] not from any other source amen
[28:27] absolutely most certainly you definitely
[28:30] want to make sure that amen before you
[28:33] go on because the Lord has blessed you
[28:34] so well in that so if it is time to move
[28:37] on you know a lot of times people think
[28:39] well the Lord's blessed me in this I'll
[28:41] be this forever no
[28:43] no they uh this means the Lord has put
[28:47] you somewhere and he's blessed you where
[28:48] he put you and if there comes a time or
[28:51] when there Comes A Time and maybe
[28:52] they'll never come a time but if it does
[28:55] then it's time to move then you move as
[28:57] he moves praise the Lord that's what uh
[29:00] children of Israel did yeah
[29:02] popular Fire by Night filler Cloud by
[29:04] day and when the Lord stayed there they
[29:07] stayed there whether it was a day or a
[29:09] year they stayed there when he moved
[29:10] they moved if it was a few hours later
[29:12] they moved it was a few years later they
[29:15] moved they didn't move till he moved but
[29:17] when he moved they moved that's what we
[29:19] are supposed to be doing amen by the
[29:21] leadership of the holy spirit in our
[29:22] life so we just trust the Lord we just
[29:24] bless Micah with the leadership to know
[29:27] the right thing to do here Amen brother
[29:30] Danny
[29:33] um
[29:34] this is a prayer request uh brother
[29:36] Danny writes a prayer request hoping
[29:38] that the government comes to a positive
[29:41] decision
[29:42] pertaining to the debt ceiling which at
[29:47] this point is a matter of days if not it
[29:50] could affect social security Medicare
[29:51] military pay also would have a global
[29:54] effect on the negative financial crisis
[29:56] that is true very very true brother
[29:58] Danny but if it does God will take care
[30:01] of us amen
[30:04] take care of his own in this world
[30:05] completely falls apart God will still
[30:08] take care of his own amen praise the
[30:10] Lord so if there's not a check in your
[30:11] mailbox or in your bank account there
[30:13] will God will put it there there's no
[30:15] food on the table God put it on the
[30:17] table amen he'll take care of us praise
[30:20] the Lord so uh appreciate that prayer
[30:23] request to know the Lord is mindful of
[30:25] us and his hand is always honest amen
[30:27] praise the Lord have an unspoken request
[30:29] on your heart today
[30:32] a little less than to our feet if we
[30:33] could
[30:35] we have quite a bit to be thankful for
[30:38] and why do men to still look to the Lord
[30:40] for and ask for and Trust for his
[30:43] Deliverance amen praise the Lord Brother
[30:45] Dennis would you take these two little
[30:47] ones Lord Jesus we come before you
[30:52] Thanksgiving and yes Jesus
[30:55] you're mindful of your own children
[30:58] thank you Jesus Lord first of all we
[31:01] need to check out where we stand with
[31:03] you Lord I just heard the prophets say
[31:07] that
[31:08] if your word comes forth and will refuse
[31:11] to cope with it to accept it or to obey
[31:15] it says that that spirit is not of you
[31:20] father yes it's another Spirit oh God
[31:23] take over
[31:25] amen a religious spirit that's the
[31:28] prophet said it's the most deceiving
[31:29] Spirit on the face of this Earth it's
[31:33] even fighting and playing into followers
[31:36] of your great message you have said
[31:38] through yourself Jesus to get a bride
[31:41] ready for a rapture and Lord this is the
[31:44] eagle age where the eagle can see higher
[31:49] in the skies than any other bird and
[31:52] lowered by your grace you have opened up
[31:54] our eyes our spiritual eyesight our
[31:58] spiritual understanding yes Jesus your
[32:01] word and oh dear we are eagles your

[32:10] the review revealed truth of this hour
[32:13] Hallelujah Lord thank you Lord anything
[32:16] for granted it's already been mentioned
[32:19] by our pastor it's time to obey your
[32:22] word obedience is better than sacrifice
[32:25] yes Lord you line up to the simple
[32:28] things it's not the the algebra on the
[32:32] greater things that will fail you it's
[32:35] the little things we leave undone yes
[32:37] and father help us to climb up to those
[32:41] ABCs that all the other things will fall
[32:44] in place and bring us into the fullness
[32:46] of the statue of Jesus Christ yes and
[32:50] father we are needing we had compassion
[32:54] as the prophet said is doing the will of
[32:56] the father and living our life for
[33:00] others is looking heaven in the face
[33:01] Jesus and father yes we should be more
[33:04] compassion to pray and be concerned
[33:07] about the lives of our loved ones the
[33:11] lives of The Sinner that unless they
[33:14] accept you as the Lord and savior of
[33:17] their lives they'll be lost and father
[33:20] we have compassion we have love for the
[33:24] needs of the people this morning may you
[33:27] come unto sea and Grant them their
[33:30] heart's desire may your healing touch be

[33:41] feelings of our infirmities and with
[33:43] yourselves we are healed Hallelujah

[33:50] victorious in you father it's time that
[33:53] as Paul said I died daily how much more
[33:56] should we die to ourselves amen
[33:59] and let your Holy Spirit have full
[34:03] control full preeminence and all other
[34:07] requests that brother Micah needs your
[34:10] leadership your guidance yes
[34:12] uh footsteps of the righteous of order
[34:15] of the Lord then they're led by the
[34:18] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[34:21] so our brother what he needs to do is he
[34:24] waits on you they that wait upon the
[34:27] Lord shall renew their strength they
[34:29] shall mount on wings of eagles and
[34:32] father all the other prayer requests you

[34:41] hearts desire from your people yes Jesus

[35:50] amen amen praise the Lord Jesus she
[35:53] could be seated if you'd like
[35:55] amen thank the Lord knows everything
[35:57] amen and I stand here always
[36:01] we take a prayer request always forget
[36:03] to mention myself uh but uh Thursday I
[36:08] kind of I must have twisted or wrenched
[36:11] my knee or something I don't know what
[36:12] happened but
[36:13] um worked out today got into the hotel
[36:15] Thursday night I knew it one time when I
[36:18] got down on one knee was working uh that
[36:21] it felt a little funny but I didn't
[36:23] think anything about it
[36:24] um it's kind
[36:27] but when I got to Maroon Thursday night
[36:30] it was a balloon so
[36:32] and it was pretty tender and so I went
[36:35] in Friday
[36:36] and I told boss he said well you take it
[36:39] easy today just sweep or something you
[36:42] know because going up and down a ladder
[36:43] what I was doing uh was causing me to
[36:46] have to go up down the ladder land up
[36:47] down up down down I said I could
[36:49] probably stand or walk but get nothing
[36:51] down a ladder and I spent 15 minutes I
[36:54] think helping kind of showing the other
[36:56] guy that I'm kind of teaching on how
[36:58] what I was doing and I just I just
[37:00] couldn't take it anymore so I just
[37:02] started working I just I can't stand and
[37:05] watch I have to work so I was back up
[37:08] and down the ladder all day again
[37:10] um but but during the night the swelling
[37:13] had gone down some and yesterday it was
[37:16] okay but and this morning the swelling
[37:19] was probably the least that it's been
[37:21] but I'm still like a flamingo I'm I'm
[37:24] kind of on one leg
[37:26] so all day Friday my my right leg just
[37:30] got so sore because I was standing on it
[37:33] the whole time and not and when I was
[37:35] going up it was with my right foot so
[37:38] it's still not normal yet I think it's I
[37:41] don't know it probably goes back to Old
[37:43] skiing injury that I had up we lived up
[37:46] in the mountains and twisted it and then
[37:48] it did that and I didn't have any money
[37:51] doctors and the Lord touched it and it's
[37:52] been fine ever since

[47:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[47:04] Saint Matthew
[47:06] chapter 7.
[47:10] and we'll begin reading verse 21.
[47:13] Matthew 7 21
[47:18] 21 amen
[47:21] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[47:23] Lord shall enter into the Kingdom of
[47:25] Heaven may he that doeth the will of My
[47:28] Father which is in heaven many will say
[47:31] to me on that day Lord Lord have we not
[47:33] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[47:36] have cast out devils and in thy name
[47:39] done many wonderful words and then will
[47:42] I profess unto them I never knew you
[47:45] depart from me ye that work iniquity you
[47:49] could be seated if you like
[47:52] amen
[47:55] is a very powerful scripture the Lord
[47:57] give us a a couple weeks ago a thought
[48:02] to bring here we brought something along
[48:04] these lines before and uh for some
[48:07] reason the Lord put it on my heart and
[48:08] entered a couple of weeks ago to bring
[48:10] it back again to our remembrance today
[48:12] but how uh how this scripture being so
[48:16] full of a message that speaks to the
[48:20] world and speaks to humanity because it
[48:23] does speak to the believer it does speak
[48:25] to the unbeliever and it does speak to
[48:28] the make-believer uh if we read it and
[48:30] understand it in that context but
[48:33] um and I don't want to title this today
[48:35] the the disappointed because a lot of
[48:38] times in life we can just start with the
[48:41] carnal a lot of times in life we are
[48:43] disappointed uh the one person that has
[48:46] never disappointed us is God if we feel
[48:49] like God has disappointed us it's
[48:51] because the expectation you have was
[48:53] beyond his will or his word right that's
[48:56] when a lot of people get disappointed
[48:58] they get disappointed because they go to
[49:01] a place in their minds and I've said
[49:02] this many times a lot of times and
[49:04] brother Branham referred to it of course
[49:06] uh is something as simple as our prayer
[49:09] life in our prayer life and talking to
[49:12] God and communicating with the Lord and
[49:13] expecting things we take up these prayer
[49:16] requests and we know that the Lord moves
[49:17] in Supernatural ways but we also know
[49:20] that the Lord moves in mysterious ways
[49:22] in ways that we can't understand uh and
[49:25] a lot of times when we pray something we
[49:28] get it built in our mind that it's going
[49:30] to be x y z that's just that we we pray
[49:35] it this way we're believing it this way
[49:37] so this has got to be the way that God
[49:39] does it but that's not always the way it
[49:42] is in fact most of us have lived long
[49:45] enough and been Christians long enough
[49:47] that we already realize that many times
[49:50] when the Lord answers our prayer he
[49:52] answers them in a completely different
[49:54] way than we thought he was going to
[49:56] everybody amen and and in the the way he
[50:00] answers it may actually be in a way
[50:03] contrary to what we thought right and
[50:06] that's what brings a disappointment
[50:08] we had uh that we feel in our minds that
[50:11] God has disappointed us we have uh
[50:14] things in our life that disappoint us
[50:16] people in our lives that disappoint us
[50:18] situations in our lives that disappoint
[50:20] us uh life and it is as they said full
[50:25] of disappointments uh the problem that
[50:28] we have a lot of times is though that we
[50:30] fixate moral the disappointments than we
[50:33] do on the achievements amen we fixate
[50:36] more on the things that have gone wrong
[50:37] and on the negative than on the positive
[50:40] and on the good amen one little thing
[50:43] comes up or one little thing happens or
[50:45] one little thing is a skewed and all of
[50:47] a sudden our disappointment outweighs
[50:50] the hundred things that were positive
[50:51] and and good and right and and then we
[50:54] end up going the wrong direction with
[50:56] this one disappointment and it puts us
[50:58] in a bad place in a place that we
[51:01] shouldn't be sometimes those
[51:03] disappointments come in some are big
[51:05] disappointments and some are small
[51:07] disappointments some are great and some
[51:10] aren't some of us some you can kind of
[51:12] roll roll over like a like a little
[51:14] Pebble and some are like a huge mountain
[51:16] in front of you but regardless there's
[51:19] always the overcoming ability that the
[51:22] Lord has given us to get beyond that
[51:24] regardless of where it might have come
[51:26] from or where it might have been now
[51:28] brother Branham gives a very good
[51:29] example of this uh when he talks about
[51:32] marriage uh I want to read this uh
[51:35] little quote that he uh that he gave
[51:37] here in the Statue of a perfect man as
[51:39] we probably all read or heard that
[51:41] message but he's talking about marriage
[51:44] and look what he says here he says a
[51:46] young man asked me the other day said
[51:49] you think I ought to get married brother
[51:51] Bradham to such and such a girl and I
[51:53] said how much do you think of her and he
[51:56] said oh my I just love her now as a
[51:59] young person or excuse me as an older
[52:02] person we realize as we look back what
[52:05] love meant to us as a young person when
[52:08] we were and our teens our early 20s
[52:11] we understand the separation the
[52:15] difference of what we saw and thought of
[52:17] as being loved then and as we realize it
[52:20] know it's me today right so when brother
[52:22] randoms referring so I say that
[52:25] because he doesn't say it but as a
[52:29] seasoned more mature person
[52:31] we can look back and understand that
[52:34] when brother random is talking about a
[52:36] young man what he is picturing from this
[52:39] young man and what the young man is
[52:41] actually saying so when the young man
[52:43] says oh I just love her you know I
[52:47] how many times have you been
[52:50] infatuated but you thought you were in
[52:52] love
[52:54] how many times have you and let's just
[52:56] put this how many times have you been in
[52:58] lust really getting carnal now and not
[53:02] in love and you thought oh this is love
[53:04] that really isn't love you have a great
[53:07] Affinity you've got some kind of
[53:08] infatuation or something or maybe even
[53:10] as Carl as lust but not really in love
[53:13] that this boy say oh I just love her
[53:17] you understand what we're saying you
[53:18] understand what brother Brandon's point
[53:21] is here amen the man the the boy says oh
[53:25] my I just love her I said well if you're
[53:28] not going to live without her you've
[53:30] buried man you better marry her then
[53:33] but if you can live without her you
[53:37] better not that's yes that's a pretty
[53:40] simple way of saying it you know I went
[53:42] to Brother green one time and asked for
[53:43] the green on and I was just trying to
[53:46] Garner some information from Brother
[53:47] green and his personal conversations
[53:49] with brother Brown and you know how
[53:51] brother green is so don't get mad I'm
[53:53] just going to tell you just exactly the
[53:55] way he said it and the context he said
[53:57] it you know him as well as I do I said
[53:59] brother Brown uh brother Green in your
[54:02] conversations with brother Brown not on
[54:04] not okay I I know I think 95 plus
[54:08] percent of what brother Brown said about
[54:10] marriage and divorce on tape I've heard
[54:12] it read it but you personally
[54:16] and your conversation that brother
[54:19] Branham ever give you any kind of
[54:21] insight into marriage and divorce that
[54:23] you could share with me it was just me
[54:25] sitting there with him there was no
[54:26] other brother since nobody else uh and
[54:30] he just looked at me he reached I
[54:32] believe if I remember right he leaned
[54:34] over his Destiny he says all I can tell
[54:35] you is if you don't want to get divorced
[54:37] don't get married
[54:40] I said okay brother what's on the docket
[54:42] for today what else do we got what the
[54:45] about
[54:47] I just tell you it exists exactly the
[54:49] way he said it at this exactly
[54:51] that was that was his answer if you
[54:54] don't want to get divorced don't get
[54:56] married
[54:57] brother random and and I thought about
[54:59] after a while after the after the height
[55:03] of the conversation settled a little bit
[55:05] and and I've had time to think about
[55:07] that which has been years that was years
[55:09] ago I asked in that and looking at what
[55:11] brother random said they're basically
[55:13] saying the same thing
[55:15] what brother green told me and what
[55:17] brother Brown told this young man are
[55:19] basically the same thing brother Brown
[55:21] was a brother Breen was a little uh more
[55:24] forward about it but but this is
[55:26] basically the same thing he said if you
[55:28] if you don't want to get divorced don't
[55:29] get married brother Ram's telling this
[55:31] young man if you can't live without her
[55:33] then you better marry her but if you can
[55:35] live without her you better not marry
[55:37] her
[55:38] that's that's kind of a bottom line to
[55:41] it they're kind of the same thing when
[55:43] you when you when you peel it out and
[55:46] um he said if you you better not marry
[55:48] but it but if it's going to kill you you
[55:52] better go ahead and get married I said
[55:53] and so uh what I was trying to get to
[55:56] him was this if you love her so much now
[56:00] right now before you're married
[56:01] everything is just fine and dandy amen I
[56:04] can't get attached to that but after you
[56:07] get married then the toils and trials of
[56:10] Life come in
[56:12] Amen brother Brown that's when you've
[56:15] got to be so in love that you understand
[56:18] one another when you're disappointed in
[56:21] her or she's disappointed in you you
[56:24] still love and understand one another
[56:26] amen amen that's where death comes in
[56:30] that's not where that transcends
[56:32] infatuation yeah that transcends a lust
[56:36] or just some sort of uh affinity for
[56:38] someone when you when you get down to
[56:41] what the tools and trials of Life are
[56:43] happening and the disappointments coming
[56:45] we have these great expectations of what
[56:48] life is going to be and what marriage is
[56:50] going to be and what having children is
[56:52] going to be and all of a sudden life
[56:54] smacks you right right across the jaws
[56:56] and and you're like oh wait uh what are
[57:00] you gonna do with that disappointment
[57:03] what are you going to do when that
[57:04] person didn't turn out to be quite to
[57:07] the expectation you thought they were
[57:08] and people get disappointed all the time
[57:11] unfortunately a lot of people when they
[57:13] reach that point they just call it quits
[57:15] and but but the worst problem of that is
[57:18] that the next person they come across is
[57:21] going to be the exact same way that's
[57:23] why you hear people getting married two
[57:24] three four six eight ten twelve times
[57:26] amen because you can't find somebody
[57:28] that's not going to disappoint them the
[57:31] problem with that is uh in in congruent
[57:35] to that is the the pro the worst problem
[57:40] the worst problem listen to me that I
[57:43] have the worst problem that Newton
[57:46] Bennett has
[57:50] the worst problem I have is me it's not
[57:53] my wife it's not my children the
[57:55] disappointment of things Oh I thought it
[57:57] was going to be like this it's never
[57:59] like you thought it was going to be like
[58:01] that this person they're never going to
[58:04] be like that be marriage is not going to
[58:07] be that Pie in the Sky having children
[58:09] is just going to be the absolute it it
[58:12] there's it's full of toils it's full of
[58:15] trousers full of disappointments the
[58:18] thing is do you love that person so much
[58:22] that you're willing to Crest every one
[58:24] of those waves right right amen and
[58:27] continue to love them and continue to
[58:30] support them because they put up with me
[58:33] and that is that is a big ask amen my
[58:37] wife we're putting Tuesday a week could
[58:40] be 38 years she's put up with me as
[58:43] married now but I knew her four or five
[58:47] years before that so we're in our
[58:49] 40-plus years of putting up with me so
[58:52] uh that that's quite a that's quite an
[58:55] accomplishment she deserves a medal amen
[58:58] and more but Christy every one of those
[59:01] disciplines and I hope you understand
[59:03] I'm bringing all this carnality into
[59:05] this all this uh Humanity into this
[59:08] equation so that we when we start
[59:11] evolving over into the spiritual part of
[59:13] it we understand where we're coming from
[59:15] amen you've got to love that person so
[59:19] much as brother Branham said here that
[59:21] it's going to Crest every wave it's
[59:24] going to continue to press forward in
[59:27] Beyond every circumstance and Beyond
[59:29] every obstacle and Beyond every toll and
[59:32] trial is going to bring uh a greater
[59:36] maturity is going to bring a a a a
[59:40] greater relationship a close
[59:42] relationship together now obviously if
[59:46] you're not like-minded to the point that
[59:49] uh one person's a a Christian the other
[59:53] one isn't and coming against it there's
[59:55] whole different scenarios there I'm just
[59:57] talking about in the regular normal
[59:59] situation there's those disappointments
[1:00:02] and everything and in every way
[1:00:06] we get disappointed all the time the
[1:00:08] reason we're disappointed is because
[1:00:10] because of us
[1:00:11] we get ourselves built up to a place
[1:00:14] that we think something's going to be a
[1:00:16] certain way or somebody's going to be a
[1:00:18] certain way and we do the exact same
[1:00:20] thing with God so many times amen that
[1:00:24] that we get disappointed but it's not
[1:00:27] God that has disappointed us
[1:00:29] it is the expectation that we have that
[1:00:33] that brings us down and that draws us
[1:00:35] down to to feeling disappointed and
[1:00:38] that's a reason a lot of time people
[1:00:40] leave leave church that they leave God
[1:00:43] that they don't serve the Lord anymore
[1:00:46] serve the message anymore because as
[1:00:49] Jesus said about the the parable of the
[1:00:52] sower uh if there's nothing there to
[1:00:55] gain root if there's nothing there when
[1:00:58] those Trials come
[1:01:00] that wind blows it's just going to blow
[1:01:02] that seed and whatever it had just right
[1:01:04] off that rock that's right it's got
[1:01:06] nothing to hold it it's got nothing to
[1:01:08] keep it stable or grounded into and so
[1:01:12] that that disappointment makes it just
[1:01:14] blow away remember and I've gone to the
[1:01:16] scripture so many times Roman 8 28. amen
[1:01:19] God makes all things work together for
[1:01:22] those that love him yeah do you love him
[1:01:25] or not that comes the bottom line can
[1:01:28] you do without him a lot of people say
[1:01:31] they can't but yet they do they live
[1:01:34] their lives without him they go beyond
[1:01:37] it's like the children of Israel we said
[1:01:39] earlier what were the children of Israel
[1:01:41] have been if the cloud was there but
[1:01:43] Moses Gossman said oh I see the cloud
[1:01:45] but you know we're we're more mature we
[1:01:48] we know what we can do let's just keep
[1:01:49] on going we've seen this place up here
[1:01:52] let's go uh go up there that'd be a lot
[1:01:54] better place to Camp than back here and
[1:01:56] leave the cloud behind you
[1:01:59] you can't do that yeah yeah you'll end
[1:02:01] up in disaster as brother Ram said you
[1:02:04] rack up
[1:02:05] you make a mistake see that's what
[1:02:07] people do they say oh I can't live
[1:02:09] without them but yet they go on about
[1:02:11] their daily lives without him right yeah
[1:02:13] they live their own lives they do it
[1:02:15] their own ways and when trials and
[1:02:17] tribulations and things come and they're
[1:02:19] disappointed and they blame God for that
[1:02:21] right and they're blaming God for
[1:02:22] something that they created that they
[1:02:25] started that they themselves
[1:02:27] manufactured and yet they blame God for
[1:02:30] it how can you blame God for something
[1:02:32] that you did yourself
[1:02:34] disappointed to God and a lot of people
[1:02:36] leave because they don't really love God
[1:02:39] if they really loved God they would do
[1:02:42] what he told them to do they would obey
[1:02:44] his word now
[1:02:46] past the carnal part of it let's talk
[1:02:49] about the scripture
[1:02:51] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:02:54] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:02:57] heaven now do you think that those
[1:02:58] people are going to be disappointed
[1:03:01] of course look
[1:03:04] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:03:07] which is in heaven what is the will of
[1:03:09] the father
[1:03:11] the will of the father is the word
[1:03:14] amen amen the will of God is his word
[1:03:18] and those that are following the will of
[1:03:21] God are following his word because he
[1:03:24] says he that doeth the will of my father
[1:03:27] and how do they do that by the spirit
[1:03:30] they do it by the spirit of God
[1:03:32] according to his word
[1:03:35] that's how they show how much of even
[1:03:38] Jesus is if you love me do what
[1:03:42] keep my Commandments
[1:03:45] that's what Jesus said if you love me
[1:03:47] keep my Commandments do my word if
[1:03:50] people aren't doing it it just shows
[1:03:52] they don't love him right amen if you're
[1:03:55] obeying the word if you're living the
[1:03:56] word I'm not talking about not not ever
[1:03:59] making mistake or slipping up or
[1:04:01] something like that we all make mistakes
[1:04:03] we all venture down as we shouldn't go
[1:04:06] or doing things or speaking up or saying
[1:04:09] something which I mean we're human
[1:04:11] sometimes the human emotion takes over
[1:04:14] uh I got frustrated on the job the other
[1:04:16] day and
[1:04:19] um
[1:04:19] I'll probably hit the
[1:04:22] uh oh that's
[1:04:25] I'm trying to explain it so you'd
[1:04:27] understand it uh that you you drill a
[1:04:30] hole in the concrete and you have to
[1:04:31] drive up uh it looks like a bolt in the
[1:04:36] ground to hold the equipment that's in
[1:04:39] anything that's out here that's in
[1:04:40] concrete you you drill a hole and you
[1:04:42] have to drive that in and I probably hit
[1:04:45] it really hard because I forgot I got
[1:04:47] frustrated or something and and Chris my
[1:04:51] big friend I told you about diabetes he
[1:04:52] looked at me says man I thought you were
[1:04:54] going to cuss
[1:04:56] I said what the world would make you so
[1:04:58] what about me would ever make you think
[1:05:00] that I would have done that he said that
[1:05:02] was probably the closest I've ever seen
[1:05:04] I said I was just frustrated because I
[1:05:06] forgot what it was it wasn't even that
[1:05:08] was important but it was funny that he
[1:05:10] even told the other guys later he said
[1:05:12] man I thought you was going to cuss
[1:05:13] today
[1:05:15] I said were you disappointed
[1:05:18] he said no he said but I just you had
[1:05:22] gotten so frustrated with that thing I
[1:05:24] said well you know I'm human I make
[1:05:26] mistakes
[1:05:31] because it was almost like
[1:05:35] um and and rightfully so that they
[1:05:39] expect you to be a certain person and I
[1:05:41] am
[1:05:42] but I told him I said but I'm a human
[1:05:44] too I'm a flesh and blood I might make
[1:05:48] mistakes you might see me do things I
[1:05:50] shouldn't amen I thankfully by the grace
[1:05:53] of God I do hold my tongue about things
[1:05:55] like that but
[1:05:56] um I I get frustrated I get upset I'm a
[1:06:00] human being so
[1:06:03] if if I make a mistake as a human don't
[1:06:06] look down on me or think less of me
[1:06:09] because I'm just a human see but the
[1:06:12] problem a lot of people have especially
[1:06:13] with church or nominal churches and even
[1:06:16] sometimes in the message they they get
[1:06:19] themselves built up to such a place in
[1:06:21] Preachers and pastors and ministers they
[1:06:24] build themselves such platforms that
[1:06:26] people have to get a crick in the neck
[1:06:28] just to look up to speak to them I said
[1:06:31] I'm just a human I'm just a man like you
[1:06:34] are right I I I I I have no desire to be
[1:06:37] on any kind of pedestal yeah I I just
[1:06:40] happened to be a a a Son of God a flesh
[1:06:44] and blood man that God put the gift of
[1:06:46] ministry in that's I there's nothing
[1:06:48] beyond that right so I make mistakes
[1:06:50] just like you and get them to understand
[1:06:52] that yeah amen get them to understand
[1:06:55] that I think the the biggest problem a
[1:06:57] lot of people have with trying to become
[1:06:59] a Christian
[1:07:00] is everybody thinks well I got to quit
[1:07:02] doing this and I got to quit going there
[1:07:04] I gotta stop doing this and I gotta stop
[1:07:06] doing that and I try to tell people no
[1:07:08] you don't right you don't have to stop
[1:07:10] drinking you don't have to stop smoking
[1:07:13] you don't have to stop doing this or
[1:07:15] going here or doing that you don't have
[1:07:17] to stop doing that I said but if you
[1:07:20] really get Christ in your heart you're
[1:07:21] going to want to right yeah
[1:07:24] amen I said now you get Christ in your
[1:07:27] heart and then
[1:07:28] we'll see what happens but she had just
[1:07:31] try to get people to understand that I
[1:07:32] say because it all becomes carnal oh I
[1:07:35] quit I can't quit doing this well then
[1:07:37] don't quit
[1:07:39] amen don't quit doing it it's like
[1:07:42] brother random uh uh
[1:07:46] trying to remember the story of a
[1:07:49] brother was in the hospital brother man
[1:07:51] was going to go pray for him and the man
[1:07:53] just couldn't quit smoking he just he
[1:07:56] just couldn't quit him brother Brandon
[1:07:58] didn't tell him to quit smoking right
[1:07:59] and and brother ran them
[1:08:03] asked another brother he said go get a
[1:08:06] carton of cigarettes and take them to
[1:08:08] this man and tell them they're for me he
[1:08:10] said now I can't take God's money and
[1:08:12] buy something as filthy as a cigarette
[1:08:14] he said but if you take your money
[1:08:16] you've earned and go and buy them and
[1:08:19] take it but just tell them it's for me
[1:08:21] tell them that I've given them to you to
[1:08:23] give them to him he said he and tell
[1:08:25] them these are brother Adam he said that
[1:08:28] man went up there and he went up and
[1:08:30] prayed for him and he said here's the
[1:08:32] carton of cigarettes for you uh from
[1:08:34] Brother Brown and he said I'm over on
[1:08:36] the table he said the man never smoked
[1:08:37] another cigarette the rest of his life
[1:08:40] amen yeah you understand that that's the
[1:08:43] whole point you don't have to stop quit
[1:08:45] smoking but when God gets you in your
[1:08:47] heart you're gonna quit yeah because you
[1:08:50] don't want to do it anymore you don't
[1:08:52] have to quit drinking would you get
[1:08:54] Jesus in your heart you're not going to
[1:08:56] want to drink anymore because you know
[1:08:58] it's displeasing doing amen see and when
[1:09:01] those that are obeying his word by the
[1:09:03] spirit of God those are the sons of God
[1:09:05] what did Brother random tell us was the
[1:09:07] was the evidence of the Holy Ghost now
[1:09:10] not in this early Ministry because he
[1:09:12] tied with different things like love and
[1:09:14] such but when the Holy Spirit spoke to
[1:09:17] brother Brown now that's why sometimes I
[1:09:19] get and I don't mean this wrong because
[1:09:21] the early messages are just as important
[1:09:23] as the later ones but you got to be
[1:09:25] careful with some of the earlier a
[1:09:27] message quotes because there are things
[1:09:30] that brother Branham taught earlier in
[1:09:32] the 50s that he changed later yeah amen
[1:09:35] so you just got to be careful about that
[1:09:37] the he didn't change it the Lord changed
[1:09:40] him it's his as his ministry evolved and
[1:09:43] moved forward
[1:09:44] God showed him different things and
[1:09:46] revealed brother random even preached
[1:09:48] the seals wrong the first time right
[1:09:50] back in the 50s
[1:09:52] 50. he preached it wrong but when the
[1:09:55] Holy Spirit he was going to preach it
[1:09:56] wrong again
[1:09:58] but when the Holy Spirit came and
[1:10:00] straightened him out that changed the
[1:10:02] whole thing right there was no more
[1:10:04] brother random it was God speaking
[1:10:07] through that man to bring a true word to
[1:10:09] a bride of Christ yes and when brother
[1:10:12] and when God did that to brother Brown
[1:10:14] then it showed how how his ministry
[1:10:17] evolved and how his ministry changed
[1:10:19] over time amen that was some things he
[1:10:22] didn't change but uh but or there were
[1:10:24] some things he did there's a lot of
[1:10:26] things he did is very uh uh very
[1:10:29] important but brother random himself
[1:10:30] said that when when the seals were open
[1:10:32] it made the Bible a new book to him
[1:10:35] amen so
[1:10:36] how could you think how could you think
[1:10:39] things would not change
[1:10:41] amen because they do change uh and and
[1:10:45] they changed for by Revelation the word
[1:10:49] that speaks to us
[1:10:51] yes but what did he tell us earlier it
[1:10:53] and he talked about love and all he
[1:10:56] talked to Lee Vale about it and Lee Vale
[1:10:58] says Ah you know I think she got love
[1:11:00] that's probably about the greatest
[1:11:02] evidence and you know as well as I do
[1:11:04] you go out here and you see people that
[1:11:05] they you go to a a Buddhist temple or a
[1:11:09] uh uh uh a visit where monks are and I
[1:11:14] mean those people they're just the
[1:11:16] Tibetans and all they probably produce
[1:11:18] more love than a dozen of us
[1:11:21] uh just just from just sheer tolerance
[1:11:26] and and and uh and love projected and
[1:11:30] all and and in their humility and things
[1:11:34] uh
[1:11:36] but that's that's just a human way of
[1:11:40] training the body to act a certain way
[1:11:42] that's not having the Holy Ghost
[1:11:44] holding the Holy Ghost and obeying God's
[1:11:47] word is is two totally different things
[1:11:49] and just training yourself to live a
[1:11:51] certain way right to talk a certain way
[1:11:53] or to act a certain way
[1:11:56] amen but later on
[1:11:59] brother Branham says the Holy Spirit
[1:12:01] straight him out
[1:12:03] and told him it was not love and it was
[1:12:06] not this other he said it was receiving
[1:12:09] the word for your day am I the best
[1:12:12] evidence of the Holy Ghost or the
[1:12:14] evidence of the Holy Ghost was receiving
[1:12:16] the word for your day amen and what does
[1:12:19] that mean that means when you receive
[1:12:22] the word you take him the word you
[1:12:24] become the word and you live the word
[1:12:26] amen that's exactly what it means when
[1:12:30] you're living the word it's not just a
[1:12:32] makeup or put on it's the holy spirit
[1:12:34] that has brought that word into your
[1:12:36] heart if there's that twinge when people
[1:12:40] and I've talked to people people that's
[1:12:42] left and all that and and and they would
[1:12:46] admit to me they've had this twinge that
[1:12:48] you know maybe it was wrong here brother
[1:12:51] Branham was wrong here the scripture was
[1:12:52] wrong here or something they already
[1:12:55] interjected their own thoughts they had
[1:12:57] already interjected their own beliefs
[1:12:59] and own ways that's not the love of God
[1:13:02] that is absolutely contrary to the
[1:13:05] evidence of the Holy Spirit which says
[1:13:08] punctuates every word with an amen amen
[1:13:12] it punctuates every word with an amen
[1:13:15] Jesus is telling them he that doeth the
[1:13:19] will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:13:21] those are the ones those are the ones
[1:13:24] that he believed that he loved and that
[1:13:26] loved him look now many though many will
[1:13:32] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:13:36] not prophesied in thy name well gifts of
[1:13:39] the Spirit is you don't even have to be
[1:13:40] saved to have a gift of the spirit we
[1:13:43] know Romans tells us that yes amen
[1:13:46] yep and in thy name have cast out devils
[1:13:50] and in thy name have done many wonderful
[1:13:53] works well when Jesus sent them out uh
[1:13:57] in in Matthew 10 and told him to go and
[1:14:00] cast out devils and do Miracles and lay
[1:14:03] hands on the sick and pray for him
[1:14:05] judas's Chariot was standing right there
[1:14:08] he was one of them when all these
[1:14:11] Miracles and all these gifts were
[1:14:13] manifested all these things were taking
[1:14:15] place Judas is carried the man that sold
[1:14:18] out Jesus Christ was standing right
[1:14:21] there doing the exact same things with
[1:14:23] the rest of them yeah
[1:14:25] amen but what was his downfall his
[1:14:28] downfall was he could not go on and
[1:14:31] receive the Holy Spirit there was
[1:14:33] something always in his heart that
[1:14:36] doubted always had to be
[1:14:39] amen had to be something that was there
[1:14:42] that doubted that doubted that that was
[1:14:44] the truth that Jesus even that Jesus was
[1:14:47] the Messiah even that that his word was
[1:14:50] the truth in obedience to his word there
[1:14:52] had to be something there to think oh
[1:14:54] there's a different way there's a better
[1:14:56] way there's something else there's uh
[1:14:59] this whatever it is reaching into the
[1:15:01] carnal into the mind that Satan has
[1:15:03] perverted to thinking things that that
[1:15:05] word is not correct and Jesus said
[1:15:08] you'll do this we did this and this and
[1:15:11] this and Jesus said
[1:15:14] then will I profess unto them I never
[1:15:17] knew you right depart from me ye that
[1:15:20] work iniquity people think they do this
[1:15:23] in Jesus name they do this and well
[1:15:25] actually they don't do very much in
[1:15:27] Jesus name anymore it's all in the fall
[1:15:28] of it's on the Holy Ghost
[1:15:30] they don't do very much in Jesus name
[1:15:33] but they'll come and say we did this in
[1:15:35] thine age oh we baptized in your name
[1:15:37] Jesus no you didn't
[1:15:39] negative you go back and God will play
[1:15:42] that back across that great canvas and
[1:15:44] say look here
[1:15:46] father son Holy Ghost
[1:15:48] that's not a name right amen and that's
[1:15:51] something very simple
[1:15:52] they cross themselves as something
[1:15:55] that's a hedonistic tradition in the
[1:15:58] scripture do you know that yeah Crossing
[1:16:00] yourself in the Bible is a hedonistic
[1:16:03] trait yes
[1:16:04] yes I can show you amen but
[1:16:08] people do it they think that's like the
[1:16:11] most religious act that you can perform
[1:16:13] is when they cross themselves they even
[1:16:15] gotten a discussion uh at lunch the
[1:16:18] brothers at lunch uh the the workers my
[1:16:21] co-workers at lunch talking about
[1:16:23] Crossing themselves and I looked I said
[1:16:25] well is there actually a a right way to
[1:16:28] do it oh yeah there's the right way and
[1:16:30] they numb
[1:16:32] I mean
[1:16:33] they grew up in Catholic school or went
[1:16:37] to Catholic church or something but none
[1:16:39] of them professes anything but y'all
[1:16:41] yeah there's the right way you do this
[1:16:43] this and this and I said well what
[1:16:45] difference does that made and see nobody
[1:16:47] could answer it because they don't know
[1:16:49] any more than that and I and I almost I
[1:16:52] came so close but I didn't want I felt
[1:16:54] like I felt checked in my spirit that it
[1:16:56] would have been of offensive right uh to
[1:16:58] say well you know it's a hedonistic
[1:17:00] treat trait to do that in the scripture
[1:17:02] but I held uh I felt checked to do it so
[1:17:05] the Lord showed me there but people will
[1:17:07] say we did this and we did this and we
[1:17:09] he said depart for me that work iniquity
[1:17:13] I never knew You Now understand that
[1:17:17] never knew you means I never had
[1:17:19] relation with you
[1:17:20] we never were together we uh uh I I I
[1:17:25] have never known you because see people
[1:17:27] say well how could he be Almighty God's
[1:17:29] no beginning for men and not know these
[1:17:32] people well you can think intellectually
[1:17:35] is one thing but knowing his
[1:17:37] relationship is something totally
[1:17:39] different
[1:17:40] knowing you as a person and yet having a
[1:17:43] relationship with you is two different
[1:17:44] things I know a lot of people in my life
[1:17:47] but there's only one person I've ever
[1:17:49] known in my entire life that I've known
[1:17:52] in the fashion that I know my wife
[1:17:54] she's the only one ever amen only one my
[1:17:58] by the grace of God I ever will amen
[1:18:01] it's the only one I ever knew in that
[1:18:04] way see so you can say well I knew them
[1:18:06] but that's not what Jesus is saying
[1:18:08] Jesus is saying this in a in a
[1:18:12] relationship capacity I never knew you
[1:18:15] means that I we never had relations
[1:18:18] amen God knew they were going to be born
[1:18:21] because he's almighty God he's
[1:18:22] omnipotent knows all things but having
[1:18:25] that relationship absolutely not oh we
[1:18:28] did this in my name we did this in our
[1:18:30] name you think those people are going to
[1:18:32] be disappointed after they feel like
[1:18:34] that they've done all these things that
[1:18:36] they say that they've done and yet Jesus
[1:18:38] looks at them and said I never knew you
[1:18:41] we never had relations you think
[1:18:46] you think oh absolutely
[1:18:48] most definitely those people are going
[1:18:50] to be disappointed look at this
[1:18:56] look at this he said in questions and
[1:18:58] answers
[1:19:01] uh let's see if this is the one that I
[1:19:03] wanted to read to you
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:09] uncertain sound let's let's go to that
[1:19:11] uncertain sound he said there there's
[1:19:13] where so many people today is going to
[1:19:17] be terribly disappointed at the day of
[1:19:19] judgment to know that they've lived in
[1:19:22] church to know that they've done good
[1:19:24] deeds do Deeds get you into heaven
[1:19:28] relationship
[1:19:30] amen relationship we've already read
[1:19:33] that Deeds don't get you in heaven
[1:19:35] because they said we did this we did
[1:19:36] this these don't get you there
[1:19:39] UE never had relation relation is what
[1:19:41] gets you there
[1:19:42] being born again yes amen
[1:19:46] done good deeds to know that they have
[1:19:49] treated their neighbor right to know
[1:19:51] that they have been loyal to the people
[1:19:53] loyal to the church and in their minds
[1:19:56] have be in their minds have believed
[1:19:58] that Jesus Christ the son of God and be
[1:20:01] condemned at the day of
[1:20:09] their lives if you go back and and see
[1:20:12] the life the life would dictate to them
[1:20:15] to understand that the evidence of the
[1:20:17] Holy Ghost is obeying the word
[1:20:20] amen obey the word now are they going to
[1:20:23] be disappointed sure they're going to be
[1:20:24] disappointing amen they're absolutely
[1:20:28] going to be disappointed he said there's
[1:20:30] uh straight As the gate there's going to
[1:20:32] be some great disappointment at the
[1:20:34] Judgment he said The Bootlegger he knows
[1:20:37] where he's going to go
[1:20:39] so does The Beer Hound uh so does the
[1:20:43] prostitute know where she'll stand so
[1:20:46] does the Gambler knows where he is
[1:20:48] standing so does the drunkard where
[1:20:49] he'll stand they'll not be disappointed
[1:20:53] they know where they are they know what
[1:20:55] their expectations are in fact a lot of
[1:20:57] people today are more vocal about their
[1:21:00] desire to go to hell
[1:21:02] than anything anyway right
[1:21:05] they think hell is going to be a funner
[1:21:08] place than Heaven yeah
[1:21:10] yeah a lot of people I've heard uh
[1:21:13] people voice that yeah
[1:21:15] yeah that they they want to go there
[1:21:18] that that that's their desire
[1:21:20] if there's not going to be any beer in
[1:21:22] heaven I don't want to go if there's not
[1:21:24] going to be any smoking or pot in heaven
[1:21:26] I don't want to go if there's not going
[1:21:28] to be any rightist living gambling and
[1:21:30] all this I don't want to go and they'd
[1:21:32] rather go to hell they're not going to
[1:21:34] be just appointed now they might get
[1:21:36] surprised when they're in hell and it's
[1:21:38] nothing like they thought it was going
[1:21:40] to be right very much like it's going to
[1:21:42] be a bunch of beer joints gambling
[1:21:43] joints and uh prostitution and they
[1:21:46] think it's going to be all like that
[1:21:47] they're going to be vastly disappointed
[1:21:49] in fact brother Brandon when God showed
[1:21:52] him hell he just fell and fell and fell
[1:21:54] and fell and fell he called for Mama
[1:21:55] there's no mama called for Daddy there's
[1:21:57] no Daddy called for God there's no God
[1:21:59] he said a literal burning hell would
[1:22:02] have been a more of a pleasure than what
[1:22:04] he was going through right than just
[1:22:06] falling and falling and falling and
[1:22:08] nothing and nobody there he said a
[1:22:10] literal burning hell would have been
[1:22:12] better than that
[1:22:13] now they might get surprised at what
[1:22:16] they find when they get there but are
[1:22:18] they going to be disappointed no they
[1:22:21] wanted to go there they knew they were
[1:22:23] going to go there the one that gets
[1:22:25] disappointed
[1:22:26] is going to be are those whose fault
[1:22:28] they were right that's where the
[1:22:31] disappointment is they thought they were
[1:22:34] right this group here oh we did this in
[1:22:37] that name we did this in that name we
[1:22:38] did this in that name but did you obey
[1:22:40] my word
[1:22:42] you have the Holy Ghost did you did you
[1:22:44] obey the word that I sent I sent a
[1:22:47] prophet to just talk about the last I
[1:22:48] sent a prophet did you obey his word did
[1:22:51] you live by the dictates of the word
[1:22:53] that came forth in the day of uh of
[1:22:56] Luther were were you living a life of
[1:22:58] justification and it's Wesley's life of
[1:23:01] sanctification and see those are very
[1:23:03] important attributes that we must attain
[1:23:06] to Saints we talked about the other day
[1:23:08] the justification and the sanctification
[1:23:10] are extremely important things nobody
[1:23:13] seems to ever want to talk about because
[1:23:15] we've gone so far beyond that into the
[1:23:18] Holy Ghost which is true but if you try
[1:23:20] to go into the Holy Ghost without the
[1:23:22] justification without the sanctification
[1:23:24] you'll never get there
[1:23:26] you can't get to the Holy Ghost unless
[1:23:29] you are first Justified and Sanctified
[1:23:31] so there's got to be those that come
[1:23:33] along but if you get to those points
[1:23:36] just like Judas did amen Judas was
[1:23:39] justified he was Sanctified uh John 10
[1:23:43] 10
[1:23:44] Jesus said Sanctified them by their by
[1:23:47] the by Thy word Lord and Judas was
[1:23:50] standing right there with him amen
[1:23:52] Justified thanks bud but when it came to
[1:23:55] going up to the to receiving the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost he sold his Lord out for 30 pieces
[1:23:59] of silver and hung himself right amen
[1:24:02] killed himself we'll just say it that
[1:24:03] way amen committed suicide so then what
[1:24:07] happens to Judas
[1:24:09] is he disappointed
[1:24:12] look
[1:24:13] the people that know are the ones that
[1:24:17] are not going to be they're not going to
[1:24:18] be disappointed
[1:24:19] but the ones that don't know see and
[1:24:22] that's the most dangerous place a person
[1:24:24] can be in today
[1:24:26] so many times people come right up right
[1:24:30] up through justification right up into
[1:24:32] sanctification they received they
[1:24:35] received that uh uh cleansing and they
[1:24:38] they become uh cleansed and clean up
[1:24:41] their lives and uh they they look like a
[1:24:44] Christian and play that part but
[1:24:47] they just don't seem to be able to go
[1:24:49] into receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:24:52] and that Holy Spirit is going to lead
[1:24:54] them and guide them into all truth that
[1:24:57] Holy Spirit is going to be what anchors
[1:24:59] them and keeps them and the evidence of
[1:25:01] that Holy Spirit is obeying God's word
[1:25:04] amen becoming that word and living that
[1:25:06] word amen and when you do you know who
[1:25:10] you are amen the sin question is
[1:25:14] obliterated because you know who you are
[1:25:18] because the word says who you are forget
[1:25:21] about mistakes forget about wrongdoings
[1:25:24] amen what is the love that you have in
[1:25:27] your heart does that love lead you to
[1:25:29] obedience in God's word amen or does it
[1:25:32] lead you to doubting God's word if you
[1:25:35] doubt God's word that's a whole
[1:25:36] different thing oh well I doubt what
[1:25:38] brother Brown said here I doubt what the
[1:25:40] Bible says here I'm not sure if this is
[1:25:42] exactly the way it should be you don't
[1:25:44] have the Holy Spirit
[1:25:46] the Holy Spirit punctuates every word
[1:25:49] with an amen
[1:25:51] amen amen
[1:25:52] amen every word with the name in
[1:25:54] that punctuation every word for amen
[1:25:56] you've been ticketed for your journey
[1:25:58] you have the ticket you have the token
[1:26:01] amen that will take you to where you
[1:26:03] need to go look that most dangerous spot
[1:26:08] brother Brown says in Jubilee year
[1:26:11] 1954 one of the older ones
[1:26:16] in Jubilee year
[1:26:19] he said so if you are lukewarm brother
[1:26:23] that's a dangerous place that you could
[1:26:26] stand is in a lukewarm condition
[1:26:29] Jesus said either be hot or cold either
[1:26:32] before me or all your with all your
[1:26:35] heart or against me
[1:26:36] if you just live a pretty good life
[1:26:38] that'll never count your self-righteous
[1:26:41] Rags will never stand at the day of
[1:26:44] judgment amen amen
[1:26:46] never stand
[1:26:48] questions and answers he said I hope you
[1:26:51] don't get angry with me but this is
[1:26:53] going to choke you he said now look ASA
[1:26:57] I'm gonna say this anyhow he said again
[1:27:00] he said I hope you don't get angry with
[1:27:02] me he said there's a people that believe
[1:27:05] in justification by faith see and they
[1:27:08] live a good clean holy life they believe
[1:27:09] in sanctification too look at Judas is
[1:27:12] carry it Genesis carry was justified
[1:27:14] when he believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:27:17] Christ and accept him as his personal
[1:27:18] savior Judas is scared you see I got the
[1:27:21] scripture wrong here
[1:27:23] Genesis carrot was Sanctified in Saint
[1:27:26] John 17 17. I think I said 10 10. uh
[1:27:30] if I was wrong forgive me but it's Saint
[1:27:33] John 17 17. he was Sanctified Saint John
[1:27:37] 17 17 and was given power in Matthew 10
[1:27:41] To Go On cast out devils and Genesis
[1:27:44] Karen come back after he healed the sick
[1:27:46] he cast out Devils he came back
[1:27:48] rejoicing shouting just as much as any
[1:27:50] good holy roll you've ever seen
[1:27:53] he said the Bible said so but when he
[1:27:55] come to Pentecost
[1:27:57] he showed his colors
[1:28:00] when it come to Pentecost he showed his
[1:28:02] colors it got right up to that point
[1:28:07] when it come to receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:28:10] it showed us colors how many people
[1:28:12] today
[1:28:13] they go through life and I I'm afraid
[1:28:16] that a lot of times and I'm going to say
[1:28:18] this I hope nobody gets angry with me
[1:28:20] but
[1:28:22] even at the Tabernacle that people were
[1:28:25] treating baptism like it was their
[1:28:28] salvation that's right
[1:28:30] and I said
[1:28:32] oh
[1:28:33] baptism is essential absolutely it's one
[1:28:36] of the ordinances that God left us but
[1:28:38] it's the it's the next step to receiving
[1:28:41] the Holy Ghost right
[1:28:43] I said that that just shows that you
[1:28:46] want to prove to the rest of the world
[1:28:48] that you've accepted Jesus as your
[1:28:50] savior but it has not as of yet shown
[1:28:54] that Jesus has received you as his son
[1:28:58] or daughter
[1:28:59] that is where you realize you've got
[1:29:02] something
[1:29:03] when Jesus fills you with his Spirit
[1:29:06] that's his proving to the world that
[1:29:10] he's received you amen you can receive
[1:29:14] him all you want millions of people say
[1:29:16] they received Jesus
[1:29:18] but has Jesus received you
[1:29:22] and so they go on in life and they live
[1:29:25] their life and they fall into this group
[1:29:26] of people
[1:29:27] amen even the make-believer falls into
[1:29:31] that group of people we know Matthew
[1:29:33] chapter 25 let's read it here real quick
[1:29:35] Matthew 25 uh we'll start with verse 10.
[1:29:44] even the make-believer the foolish
[1:29:46] virgin will say
[1:29:48] look while they were while they went to
[1:29:51] buy the bridegroom King
[1:29:53] and they that were ready went in with
[1:29:56] him to the marriage and the door was
[1:29:57] shut
[1:29:58] afterward came also the other virgin
[1:30:01] saying the Lord Lord open to us now
[1:30:03] remember they were virtuous
[1:30:05] they were all 10 virtuous they had never
[1:30:08] been defiled by any man's idea right
[1:30:13] yet they just had not received the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost
[1:30:16] the answered and said they say Lord Lord
[1:30:19] open us but he answered and said verily
[1:30:21] I say unto you I know you not
[1:30:24] watch therefore for ye for ye know
[1:30:27] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[1:30:30] son of man cometh but go back to the
[1:30:32] 12th verse Jesus told them
[1:30:35] I know you not now that's a different
[1:30:42] I know the word no is the same as it was
[1:30:46] that we just read in Matthew 7.
[1:30:48] but if you go look it up in the Greek
[1:30:51] you'll find that it actually has two
[1:30:53] different meanings
[1:30:54] and this no
[1:30:56] means that I am ignoring you
[1:31:00] it's it doesn't mean that we didn't have
[1:31:03] relation it doesn't mean that I never I
[1:31:05] never knew you
[1:31:07] he's just saying I know you're not or
[1:31:10] I'm ignoring you right now
[1:31:12] I'm putting you off if you will
[1:31:15] the door's shut
[1:31:17] and when the door's shut nobody gets in
[1:31:19] nobody gets out we learned that from
[1:31:20] Noah's Ark
[1:31:22] when God shut the door nobody can get in
[1:31:24] the ark nobody can get out of the Ark
[1:31:26] Noah couldn't even open the door to any
[1:31:28] of his relatives friends neighbors or
[1:31:30] anybody God shut the door that was it
[1:31:33] when God shuts the door that's it
[1:31:35] they're on the outside and they're
[1:31:37] knocking again in he says I I don't hear
[1:31:40] you I'm not listening to you
[1:31:42] amen now what are those people gonna
[1:31:45] have to go through
[1:31:46] judgment right they're going to have to
[1:31:49] go through judgment and and seal their
[1:31:52] testimony that they had of Jesus Christ
[1:31:54] with their own blood
[1:31:57] whereas the bride she goes in the
[1:32:00] Rapture and she sets the marriage supper
[1:32:02] of the Lamb right while the foolish
[1:32:04] Virgin Goes to the tribulation now how
[1:32:07] many of them doesn't say Amen but let's
[1:32:11] go over to Saint Luke
[1:32:13] because I won't be much longer Saint
[1:32:15] Luke chapter 13.
[1:32:18] and let's read beginning with verse 23.
[1:32:25] then said one unto him Lord
[1:32:28] are there few that be saved and he said
[1:32:31] unto them and
[1:32:33] you can imagine
[1:32:36] how many of you would have thought that
[1:32:38] if you were one of the ten even if you
[1:32:40] were Judas if you were one of the 10 and
[1:32:43] you were following along with Jesus for
[1:32:45] about three years now
[1:32:47] and you're sitting there thinking well
[1:32:49] Jesus
[1:32:50] and maybe in your mind maybe audibly
[1:32:53] Jesus
[1:32:54] we we've been going around everywhere
[1:32:56] for three years
[1:32:58] and we've not added one single person to
[1:33:00] our congregation it's still the same 10
[1:33:03] people that was here when you called us
[1:33:05] you called us one right after the other
[1:33:07] and every one of us all 10 of us have
[1:33:10] followed you ever since we've been gone
[1:33:11] three years now we haven't added one
[1:33:14] single person
[1:33:15] you imagine that would cross their minds
[1:33:18] it will cross my mind amen this has been
[1:33:22] one more person added to this church
[1:33:24] Jesus and you're God Almighty of Heaven
[1:33:27] and Earth and don't have but one don't
[1:33:28] haven't added one more follower to your
[1:33:30] congregation
[1:33:32] yeah is that the truth
[1:33:35] when he was crucified he only had nine
[1:33:39] that believed it because Judas has
[1:33:41] already killed himself
[1:33:43] amen so
[1:33:45] hadn't had one so you can imagine their
[1:33:49] thoughts went to a certain place well
[1:33:51] they're asking him now Lord are there
[1:33:54] only going to be a few saved there's
[1:33:56] only 10 of us are there only going to be
[1:33:58] a few say he said unto them strive to
[1:34:01] enter in at the Straight Gate
[1:34:05] for many I say unto you will seek to
[1:34:09] enter in and shall not be able now these
[1:34:12] are a group of people that are seeking
[1:34:14] it but are not able to get in well
[1:34:17] there's a lot of people that seek it
[1:34:19] this churches will throw excuse me
[1:34:21] churches were full this morning of
[1:34:24] people all around the world that claim
[1:34:27] they're seeking amen but Jesus here says
[1:34:30] that they will seek to enter in and
[1:34:34] shall not be able
[1:34:36] well what was it what were the five
[1:34:38] foolish virgins
[1:34:40] the five foolish were seeking to get in
[1:34:43] they just didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:44] amen amen amen when Once the Master of
[1:34:49] the House is risen up and has shut the
[1:34:51] door
[1:34:53] ye begins to stand without him uh to
[1:34:56] knock at the door saying Lord Lord open
[1:34:58] unto us and he shall answer and say unto
[1:35:01] you I know you I know you not when she
[1:35:04] are
[1:35:04] now that he's talking to the same place
[1:35:07] that Noah is the same one that was in
[1:35:09] Matthew 25. amen I'm ignoring you he's
[1:35:12] stepped forward the door has been shut
[1:35:15] the the bride didn't shut it the five
[1:35:19] wise didn't shut it amen God shut it God
[1:35:23] shut the door on Noah's Ark God shut
[1:35:26] that door
[1:35:27] and there's a time that that door will
[1:35:30] be shut saying there will be a time
[1:35:32] where that door will be shut and we'll
[1:35:35] still be here
[1:35:36] and there will be nobody else saved
[1:35:39] beyond that point right or born again
[1:35:42] yes amen there won't be one beyond that
[1:35:46] point because the door will be shut and
[1:35:48] we'll still be here now I don't believe
[1:35:50] will be my opinion I don't believe we'll
[1:35:52] be here very long
[1:35:53] uh the Bible doesn't specify for the
[1:35:56] brown never specified or gave a time or
[1:35:59] a number of days but in my opinion I
[1:36:02] don't think it's going to be very long
[1:36:04] that's my opinion but there will be a
[1:36:08] time
[1:36:09] and and Jesus said here
[1:36:12] they will say Lord Lord open unto us and
[1:36:15] he shall say unto you I know not which
[1:36:18] ye are
[1:36:21] amen amen because when God shuts the
[1:36:24] door the door is shut there's no more
[1:36:26] can come in there's no more can get can
[1:36:28] go out
[1:36:29] amen what was the one thing the foolish
[1:36:31] virgins were lacking the Holy Ghost now
[1:36:34] what did Jesus go on and say okay that's
[1:36:37] that's one uh a parable of the Bible
[1:36:41] that he's referring to now he goes on
[1:36:45] and he said then then shall ye begin to
[1:36:49] say we have eaten and drunk in thy
[1:36:52] presence
[1:36:53] and thou has taught in our streets but
[1:36:56] he shall say I tell you I know you not
[1:36:59] when she are depart from me all ye
[1:37:02] workers of iniquity it's a different
[1:37:05] there shall be weeping gnashing of teeth
[1:37:09] and ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and
[1:37:12] Jacob and all the prophets in the
[1:37:13] kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust
[1:37:17] out
[1:37:19] you think they're going to be
[1:37:20] disappointed
[1:37:22] absolutely
[1:37:24] they were thinking
[1:37:27] brother random said you'll be surprised
[1:37:29] at the ones that'll make it you'll be
[1:37:31] very surprised at the ones who don't
[1:37:33] make it right amen I just believe I'm
[1:37:36] one that will make it amen you have to
[1:37:39] believe the exact same thing
[1:37:41] because you know who you are you know
[1:37:44] who your redeemer is you don't fall in
[1:37:46] this category that says oh we thought we
[1:37:49] you obey the word your whole heart's
[1:37:52] desire is is in obeying this message and
[1:37:55] obeying this word and living that life
[1:37:59] and it is that way because it is listen
[1:38:03] to me it is that way because you have
[1:38:07] been born again
[1:38:09] your desires are that way because you've
[1:38:12] been born again you have the Holy Ghost
[1:38:14] if you did not have the Holy Ghost your
[1:38:17] desire would not be for that
[1:38:20] amen it might be 99 of that but there's
[1:38:24] going to be one thing out there that's
[1:38:26] going to have a doubt and that's exactly
[1:38:28] where uh Eve was
[1:38:31] she believed the word but when Satan
[1:38:33] came with just that one word that
[1:38:36] Twisted it and and that doubt was there
[1:38:39] and all of a sudden he was able to sow a
[1:38:42] seed and that so is that that seed sown
[1:38:45] the king king as strangely enough
[1:38:47] another discussion we had at lunch
[1:38:49] I I can't remember it was the same day
[1:38:52] or the next day that we started talking
[1:38:54] about Adam and Eve
[1:38:56] and so and and what I'm talking about an
[1:38:59] apple I said you know it wasn't an apple
[1:39:01] right
[1:39:01] and the manager of the group he said oh
[1:39:04] yeah I knew that a long time ago the
[1:39:05] Catholic the one that's a that was went
[1:39:08] to Catholics they sell he said that took
[1:39:10] me a long time to figure that out but I
[1:39:12] found that out a long time ago but I
[1:39:14] said well yeah it could have been an
[1:39:15] apple because it produced cane That's
[1:39:18] Right
[1:39:18] amen and they actually strangely enough
[1:39:21] all these guys and don't know and
[1:39:25] have no affiliation degree
[1:39:28] you you go tell some scholar in the
[1:39:31] scripture or some denominational that
[1:39:34] they'll think you're crazy
[1:39:36] amen you get a uh you get a table full
[1:39:41] of people that don't really claim to
[1:39:43] believe anything and they understand it
[1:39:45] yeah
[1:39:46] yeah it's amazing though isn't it how it
[1:39:48] goes just the way it is with people but
[1:39:51] it's true
[1:39:53] amen these will be these will be
[1:39:55] disappointed amen this group will be
[1:39:58] disappointed they shall come from the
[1:40:01] east or the west from the North and the
[1:40:02] South sit down in the kingdom of God and
[1:40:04] behold there are the last which shall be
[1:40:07] first and they're the first which shall
[1:40:09] be last there's that that same group of
[1:40:13] people amen
[1:40:17] it shows it proves that there's
[1:40:19] something in you
[1:40:22] you can look at the Rich Young Ruler
[1:40:26] the Rich Young Ruler was probably one of
[1:40:28] the most Pious individuals in the
[1:40:30] scripture
[1:40:33] even so
[1:40:35] even to the point that the Bible says
[1:40:39] that Jesus looked on the man and loved
[1:40:42] him amen he was that good of a person he
[1:40:46] was that humble or that Pious or
[1:40:49] whatever you want to say about it the
[1:40:51] Bible says and there aren't many places
[1:40:55] he's Jesus looked on him and loved him
[1:40:59] but in the end he had he had to say
[1:41:02] depart you work of iniquity yeah because
[1:41:06] he turned Jesus down
[1:41:09] Jesus gave him the way we'll do this
[1:41:10] this and this this oh well I've done
[1:41:12] that since I was a boy I can
[1:41:15] that's no problem
[1:41:16] sell all you got and give it to the poor
[1:41:18] oh he couldn't do that
[1:41:20] amen there's the difference
[1:41:23] there's the difference if you love me do
[1:41:26] what do what I tell you keep my
[1:41:29] Commandments what's the evidence of the
[1:41:31] Holy Ghost obeying the word what was
[1:41:33] that to the Rich Young Ruler that was
[1:41:35] the word that was the word to him and he
[1:41:37] couldn't obey it so what did I tell you
[1:41:39] he didn't have Goods
[1:41:41] he didn't have what it took and we know
[1:41:43] where his eyes lifted up where he ended
[1:41:45] up in the scripture
[1:41:46] but it's good to manage probably you
[1:41:48] ever want to find him again to the point
[1:41:49] that Jesus loved him
[1:41:52] he and and the evidence in his life
[1:41:56] was that after he turned Christ down he
[1:41:59] got richer he got more famous he built
[1:42:01] more barns he got he had to buy he had
[1:42:04] to build more barns just to put more of
[1:42:05] his stuff in
[1:42:07] a boat a jet ski a a a a pontoon boat
[1:42:12] one boat wasn't good enough he had to
[1:42:13] have a pontoon too you know he had to
[1:42:16] have six more cars because the one he
[1:42:18] had wasn't sufficient and I had to build
[1:42:21] more barns just and so you look and say
[1:42:23] well Mike he must really be blessed of
[1:42:26] God look at how God has blessed him and
[1:42:28] he's prospering no he turned God down
[1:42:30] yeah
[1:42:33] yeah so what did all of that do for him
[1:42:36] yeah once he ended up in hell
[1:42:39] in in the grave in a place of
[1:42:43] where he was lost
[1:42:45] a place where he was lost
[1:42:47] disappointed
[1:42:49] I could only imagine
[1:42:51] I Can Only Imagine
[1:42:55] amen one more quote I'm going to close
[1:42:58] friends tonight this is uh we have found
[1:43:01] him 1953. oh one two friends tonight I
[1:43:04] believe if any man will come in this day

[1:43:09] I'm not going to take any of my thoughts
[1:43:12] there you go dime to self I'm not going
[1:43:14] to take any of my thoughts I'm just
[1:43:16] going to open my heart to you God
[1:43:18] you reveal yourself to me I want to see
[1:43:22] I believe God will reveal himself to the
[1:43:25] people to the people that wants to find
[1:43:28] him he has never disappointed anyone
[1:43:32] amen amen it's the ones that get it
[1:43:35] built up
[1:43:37] and expect it a certain way and they
[1:43:39] don't get it well then I just don't
[1:43:40] believe God then
[1:43:42] because it didn't come exactly the way
[1:43:44] you thought it was it's like the boy
[1:43:45] brother man talked about the boy
[1:43:47] throwing the prayer book in the trash or
[1:43:49] in the fire because his mom didn't get
[1:43:51] healed she died anyway
[1:43:52] well I just forget the whole thing then
[1:43:57] what you said start with
[1:44:00] but if you believe God you know that
[1:44:01] this is bringing about the work of the
[1:44:03] Lord and his good pleasure and that's
[1:44:06] what we're here for yes that is what

[1:44:29] uh disappoint myself all the time
[1:44:34] but God will never discipline amen and
[1:44:36] he knows
[1:44:38] and I'm gonna say this is the last thing
[1:44:41] my opinion we never disappoint him
[1:44:45] because he knows us
[1:44:48] amen do we make mistakes absolutely do
[1:44:50] we disappoint one another yeah because
[1:44:52] of our expectations but God's
[1:44:54] expectations aren't up there his
[1:44:55] expectations are worth he knows who you
[1:44:58] are he knows who all of us are amen you
[1:45:01] see everybody preaches about how the
[1:45:03] devil knows our weaknesses well God
[1:45:04] knows them too
[1:45:06] God knows what
[1:45:08] those free God knows where you need help
[1:45:10] God knows where you need fortification
[1:45:11] God knows your strengths he knows
[1:45:13] everything about you when something
[1:45:15] comes up or
[1:45:16] something happens
[1:45:18] he understands God knows amen and then
[1:45:23] when we come before him and repent and
