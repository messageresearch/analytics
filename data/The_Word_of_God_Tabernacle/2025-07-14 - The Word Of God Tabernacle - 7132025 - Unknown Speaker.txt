May you fill all this house, God. May your Holy Spirit have the preeminence once again. Heal those that are sick and body, meet every need, fill every life, Lord.

So thankful the Lord is with us today. His grace is sufficient. Mercies endure forever. Thankful for air conditioning. Sorry about last Sunday. I got here Saturday. Come in as I normally do because I spend uh several hours in here on uh Saturday and uh turn the air on and the the the fan was working but the pump was just the compressor was just clicking on and off and and off so it wasn't blowing any cold air. So, I was here about four. I limited my Saturday to about four hours last Saturday as it got hot because it was it was 88 in here according to that thermostat and it's at least 10 degrees hotter in the fellowship hall best view, whatever we want to call out there. It was hot out there. I had the fan turned around on me. Uh so, but uh and I did not I tried contacting Craig, couldn't get anybody to respond on Saturday, so unfortunately I had to cancel service. Uh but uh he texted me Sunday, last Sunday morning at 11:30 and said it was fixed. I guess he assumed we had service, but I told him I said we canled service. I I didn't hear from you. I didn't know if it was going to be fixed, when it's going to be fixed. I didn't know anything about it. Uh so anyway, thank you for your patience. Glad to be here today.

He's so good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good to us. Praise the Lord. I want to go to the Lord in prayer now. Amen. We have some prayer requests to bring to your attention. Brother Dennis is not with us today. As you all know, his wife Leah had surgery this week. She came through the surgery well, but she's progressing good, but she's very weak. And brother Dennis stayed home to try to take care of her. Uh brother Dennis also went to his podiatrist Friday. He's been having a lot of problem especially with the I think the right foot, but he's had ulcers on the other foot. Uh the doctor, the podiatrist gave him a special kind of boots for both feet um to try to help and told him to stay off of his feet as much as possible, which is kind of difficult to do when you're trying to take care of your wife. &gt;&gt; Uh so please pray for the both of them. Leah is doing good. She is getting better. Uh just pray of course, brother Dennis. uh his sores would get better, his feet would get better, the Lord will just touch them both. Amen. Supernaturally right now. Also got a text from brother Danny this morning. Uh he's been helping his neighbor Patty in preparation for I guess as I'm I'm sure u maybe you don't know, Ron uh passed away. Uh the neighbor friend of Danny's that we've been praying for, he did pass away a couple of days ago. Uh had cancer. So, please remember the family in prayer, those affected. Uh, but Danny, I guess he just had a hard time sleeping, so he was able to be with us today. So, please remember him hopefully prayfully. They're both streaming today. Amen. So, please remember them in prayer. Also want to remember uh the floods, the people that are affected, floods in Texas. Um, wanted to certainly make that a point of of prayer for last Sunday uh as it had just happened that Saturday. But we certainly want to and I know you I know your hearts. I know you've all heard and uh probably have already been praying. But please pray for those people, those that are uh families that are left behind and families that lost little children, little girls 8, 9, 10, 11 years old. Uh just unfathomable, especially now with grandchildren. Uh right in that age range, it's just unfathomable what that family is going those families are going through. So, uh, please remember, I believe the body count is up to over 170 now with, uh, over a hundred still missing. Um, so please pray for them. Pray, pray they'll find, uh, probably one of the only things worse than losing a loved one like that and that drastic and that quick is not ever finding them. Uh, so let's please pray they turn up and find them. Uh, however that works, so that that everybody can closure. We know those children before the age of accountability, they're going to be in heaven. Amen. So, uh we're thankful for that. We're thankful to know that and that the Lord would just uh uh bless and help those homes. My my both two of my mother's two of my mother's sisters aunt my aunts used to live in Kerbal, Texas. So, I've been through there, know the area somewhat uh and the that river that runs through there. So, uh kind of was a little bit personal to me too I guess in a way but uh certainly want to remember them in prayer. So good to see each of you. God bless you today. Anyone else have a prayer request? Anything on your parts today? &gt;&gt; Sister Amen. Yes. Thank you for that. So, I appreciate your prayers for that. Amen. It wasn't as hot here as it was there, but in Houston, but the humidity there is uh sometimes even if it's hot here, you can find a little shade. You're you you can cool off a little bit there. It's like it follows you wherever you go. The humidity, if you've ever lived in humidity, I know the bats from Memphis and all is really humid in Memphis. Houston is very humid. Uh and uh so yeah, it was hot. Thank you, sister. I appreciate that. Remember family members though uh having to be in that. So I'm going back to Houston next week, too. So do appreciate that. Anyone else? Let's stand our feet. You have an unspoken prayer question all of our needs today. Please stand your feet if you could ask for our gracious heavenly father. Lord God, we come to you today. &gt;&gt; Allow us to come together. allow the circumstances, Father God, their conditioning face for us, Lord Jesus. We ask that you would forgive us of all our sins, anything that would stand between us and you, Lord, just making sure that that we're clean so that when we approach your throne, we know that our our prayers are going to be answered and reach your throne and not be blocked by Yes. &gt;&gt; by the powers of Satan, Lord Jesus. Thank you. &gt;&gt; May you help each and everyone, Lord Jesus, that can't be here, Dennis and Danny, and Lord Jesus, Sister Lydia, Lord Jesus, whatever you have left for her life, whether it's to be here to go home. Lord Jesus, we lift her in your name, &gt;&gt; Lord God. And Lord, those that have family members that aren't quite in yet, Lord Jesus, hasn't haven't quite accepted you in the message, Lord Jesus. We bring them to you, Father God, each and every time, Lord God, expecting them to be here with us at some point whenever your will would have them. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Those that work as our sisters mentioned, Lord Jesus, the families affected directly and indirectly by the floods that occurred in Texas and other disasters that are occurred throughout the US that we don't sometimes hear about. Father God, may you be with us as remaining part of the service to move every hindering spirit from this place to interfere with moving of your spirit, Lord God. Commit ourselves in the service into your hands and believe that you will meet each and every need that we have in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You can be seated if you like. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Let's go to song number 34. I have the song book.

Um, &gt;&gt; go right ahead. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Go right ahead. Amen. So, as everybody knows, I had that seizure in December and um it was it was really tough. Um definitely something I never experienced before and it was extremely scary. Um but they they had determined that the seizure was caused by um acute respiratory failure, the severe sepsis, &gt;&gt; and it was all due to bacterial pneumonia. So, I was on four different antibiotics. I was intubated for 24 hours. And um when they took the tube out because I had zero respiratory symptoms, no nothing. But I had a headache, a constant headache the week, the whole week before and did not think anything about respiratory. When they took that tube out, it was almost like I had again is what it just felt like in my chest. And um so I spent I was there for three days and dismissed on Christmas day with discharge. And um it was just really it was really hard because when I got the medical report they said that I had starting on the top of my head they were saying that I had small vessel eskeemic disease. &gt;&gt; They're they said I had a 1.4 to 1.6 mass in my parotted gland and um let's see and then from QT in my heart which is the it's the the lower chamber is not beating in rhythm that it should be so long pause and I I can hear it at night when I'm sleeping if I'm laying on my left side I in my head um because it's just trying to be so hard. Um but I believe when Dennis prayed for me that day, um I felt just this wave of peace and that so I know that it's it's not an issue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just I you know just completely everything that they said. Um they said I was in stage three renal failure. &gt;&gt; Um so they basically had me on my death bed really because when I was in the emergency room &gt;&gt; and I started having procedure. They asked my sister if I had a DMR. So they weren't really kind of expecting you know and I know that my sister reached out to brother Newton and um you know my family other family members who are Christian and um it was it was pretty funny because I was in ICU and they had they had residents coming in and all this and um every single person that came in on Sunday or on Monday when I was there they all said, "You are progressing so quickly." And I just I knew it was it's the prayers that were going up. &gt;&gt; And so I just, you know, that whole that whole scenario was just, you know, even even with my driver's license, I couldn't drive for for 90 days. &gt;&gt; Um, I was sitting and pray and just, you know, praying about the whole thing because they said I wouldn't be able to get my EEG until April. And then I got a call 10 minutes later. I asked the Lord I said please for you know are you hearing my prayers and literally with 10 minutes they called me back and said you know are you available March your team so it was I was did my five day ambulatory EG and um it was it was so nice because March 22nd was the 90 days the end of the 90 days and then I had was supposed to get my driver's license within 30 days of that 90 days And I got on because I went to the hospital December 22nd and then I got my driver's license on April 22nd. So God's perfect timing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was right, you know, like right on that day. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then sister was we were trying to she was trying to help me take me and then my niece got home and I just said, "You need to run me up there." It was 4 4:30. I'm like, "You need to run me up there." They last appointment was at 4:45 and there was nobody there. &gt;&gt; There's nobody there. Even sister and I earlier was just all these really long lines even before they open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, it was just the whole thing. I started to take it so long, but I wanted to make sure that I got everything so that you know to really see what God did, how how drier the situation was and just what he did all the way from completely healing which I totally believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I know it's very wrong. So, Lord, please forgive me. Um, but it just not Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just I'm so thankful that he's just so much more real to me now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Just he's amazing. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes. The Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God is so good. Amen. We had I have to give this testimony real quick, but we had probably the first I've been doing this job about three years. Probably the first what I consider mishap uh at the job. We were putting this big 150 200 lb uh apparatus up on a huge arch 15t in the air. Uh I was up on the top rung of a 8ft ladder. Other guy was on the top rung of a 8ft ladder. Two guys in a scissor lift over here trying to lift this thing up. and um just about had it put in there and for some unknown reason one guy that was holding it keeping it steady from tipping let go and I'm sitting here trying to put a bolt in and all of a sudden the thing starts pulling away and I'm like what's going on and I tried to grab it and it just it just kept going and I realized it was falling uh and I just grabbed onto the ar just fell onto the arch. The thing fell. It fell where there was nobody. Uh, and it fell 15 feet down. This 200lb thing fell 15 feet down to the ground. &gt;&gt; And it was fortunately was nobody there. It hit my ladder that I was on. Knocked it over into a hole. Uh, so if I wasn't holding on, the whole ladder would have just gave way. U, it twisted the ladder. The ladder was twisted sideways like this after that big thing hit. Uh but we just stood there for a second and after this thing was laid down there and everybody's like, "Okay, we're okay. Everybody's okay." Yes. So, uh thankfully the Lord kept us safe and it could have been a whole lot worse because that thing could have fell over. Uh, and you know, it did kill you. It hit you falling 200lb big piece of metal falling 15 feet in the air. Uh, but I'm thankful that the Lord kept it. Amen. Busted the motor up. So, they have to wear a new one. But, uh, we were all safe and I'm so thankful for that. Amen. And I believe that the Lord was because I felt like uh I I had I had gone up to the top rung of the ladder and I was sitting on I was standing on top top of an eight foot ladder. Two legs on the conveyor, two legs on the other and so it was already warped. It was already crooked. But as long as I'm hanging on to something, I'm okay. Uh but when I was on the top, I just felt I just I just felt like something was saying don't stand on the top. Uh, so I got down to the one rung below the very very top. U if I hadn't, I don't know that I would have had anything to stabilize me because it was because when that thing hit the ladder, I felt it jerk out from under me. Uh, but because I had my feet there holding it, it didn't go anywhere. So, uh, God is mindful. Amen. He knows. &gt;&gt; Yes, sister. Well, the ladder was twisted, but it was still um it was still to the place I grabbed. I I had a hold of the the scissor lift and the arch and the ladder was still up. It was just twisted and this leg was in the hole. So, I just let go of the arch and held on to the scissor lift and just kind of inch my whole rung at a time on the bladder. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, thankful for that. A lot a lot a lot of things could have gone a lot longer than what they did. So, uh I'm just very thankful the Lord was present. Amen. Kept us safe. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, thank the Lord Jesus. He is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet if we could. Uh we'll just go to the scripture now. Go over to uh back over to Romans chapter 8 as we read just first portion again uh to go back into the our adoption series. We're adoption part 20 now. Uh position in Christ part four. Adoption part 20. Our position in Christ part four. Amen. And we'll go Romans 8 again as we have to start this series about uh on this adoption. Amen. Praise the Lord. Before we read though, could we just bow our heads for another word of prayer? Lord Jesus, so very thankful again, Father, of your blessings, your grace, your love, your mercy. Thank you for giving us, Lord, anything and everything we could ever hope or ask for. Thank you for your protection. Thank you for being so good to us, Lord. God, you know, before things are ever even going to happen. And Lord, you just give us that little uncction, just that little feeling, uh just something, God, that we know that you're with us and that keeps us safe. We thank you for your power, Lord, and for the strength that you give us even when we go through some of our most tumultuous times. We know that you are there with us and leading and guiding us. Lord, we don't know that what it might do to affect somebody else or uh make a difference in somebody else's life, just the things that happen to us for those people that are around us, God, and how good and how uh gracious you are to us, Lord. God, we just want to be a witness. We want to be a blessing. We want to be a an instrument, a light, God, to whomever's paths we cross. Father, whether they're in the hospital or whether they're at a DMV or whether they're on the job or uh our families or whatever it is, God, we just want to be that light, that beacon, that example, Lord, that we can be written epistles read of all men. Use us and bless us along the way, God, for we are your disciples and we need you, God, more than ever. We pray Lord Jesus now that you would help and speak this word to our hearts Lord. May it come forth with power and manifestation of your spirit and not return void but accomplish in us that that you sent it forth for. I truly believe Lord maybe even more than ever God. We are at the end of this thing. We are at the time, Lord, that every one of us, everyone that considers themselves a portion of your bride has found their position or is finding their position, their placement to get into, to live, to to uh to fulfill that purpose, Lord, that you put in every one of us, Father. And that purpose is your purpose, God. May you just bless it now. I commit myself to you. We all do, Lord. Pray that Lord you'd speak the words you'd have us to hear. Anoint our ears Lord to receive. We commit it all to you and ask your blessings now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Romans chapter 8. Amen. We start with verse 14 again. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba father. The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children then hes of God join he hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. Uh last time that we were together uh we left off with the adoption of Christ, the adoption of Jesus. a scene that we had scripturally of the adoption of Christ. So, I want to go back over there and I want to try to finish that part. It's a something I didn't get to read that we wanted to delve into and then try to uh springboard uh there's a few portions of this that I wanted to add to it to bring this along to one entire subject. So, I didn't want to really take that and break it into two different services. I wanted to try to give that one subcontext in at one time in one service. So uh so that hopefully it comes forth and it's uh that it's uh it uh it's received in such a way. So that was the intention. So let's go over to St. Matthew uh chapter 17 again read once again about this adoption the adoption of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now we know that Jesus was baptized. We've read that. We recognize that John baptized Jesus. Jesus came to John and said, "You need to baptize me." He said, "Suffer that to be so." But we are here to fulfill all righteousness. So you, so John had to baptize Jesus so the sacrifice could be washed before it is presented, before it's brought to sacrifice. So is so John baptized him. When he came out of the water, we saw that Jesus, the Holy Spirit came in and on him just as it did to the 120 in the upper room on the day of Pentecost, trusting that it is exactly of course uh what it has done to us. Amen. That anointing of the Holy Spirit on us, but also the indwelling presence of the person of Jesus Christ in us. Amen. That's the new birth. Amen. The new birth is the person of Christ living in you. Amen. But as Jesus was baptized and as he came out of the water and was filled with the spirit, Amen. The Bible says the spirit of God. Amen. We know that he continued on with his life, with his ministry, with all that he did. Praise the Lord. We also talked about even uh uh 10 plus years before that uh Jesus was leaving uh Mary and Joseph and going about they lost him and didn't know where he was. and uh they finally track backtracked and found him. He said, "Don't you know I must be about my father's business." So he was already being led of God. But we didn't see that adoption until here in Matthew 17 or Matthew uh yeah, Matthew 17. We didn't see that adoption or placement. Amen. The positionally placement of it. Praise the Lord. It can be He was fulfilling that life. He was fulfilling that ministry. He was living that life. Amen. Just as all of us do. But that placement didn't come here till we see in Matthew chapter 17. Amen. So people come the place they say, "Well, uh, my my new birth was my adoption." No, it wasn't. Amen. Separate things. The adoption, it's the the new birth, that's your birth. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's just like uh uh uh if a newborn baby comes into a family uh the b they go to the hospital and the baby is born and you know the the father they they they cut the umbilical cord and wipe the baby off the vipes clean and give it to the daddy it's all wrapped and beautiful and the daddy says now it's your turn to take out the trash. The baby doesn't know anything about trash. Amen. uh he's trying to positionally place a little baby and a baby's not in position to be placed. Amen. It might receive that later, but sometimes as they grow up, their very uh life and and and nature and all dictates. Of course, now God knows all this before the foundation of the world. But as us as humans, we may not know that till the children start growing up and you start seeing their idiosyncrasies and their lives and their natures and the way they are and how they live and what they do, you know, uh how they develop and and each of them you can raise them the same and they'll still develop different. Uh it's just the way it is because they're two separate people. Amen. And that's how that's how God's that's the that's the beautiful bouquet that that uh encompasses God's beautiful garden is all of us. Amen. Because we're all different. We're all different in that way. So we come along and we're raised and we live and and then this placement comes. This is the placement. Uh Matthew 17, let's read through this again. And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them. Now, hopefully, I'm going to try my best to get to that today. I hope I don't have to break this up for time's sake, so forgive me if we do, but I'm going to try to. But remember, keeping that transfigured that word, keep that word in your mind. Hold that uh close because we're going to come back to that a little later. and was transfigured before them. Because I I want what I want to do is to take this subject and I want to parallel this to us, who we are. Amen. It's good to know who Jesus was and we should worship him as he is. Amen. And and give him all all love and benevolence. He's he's the Lord of all. He's God almighty. Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess. Jesus Christ is Lord. We know that. But what is what about us? Amen. What is our place? Where where are we positioned in this? How does it involve us? Let's look. He was transfigured before them. And his face did s shine as a sun. And his reignment was white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with them. Now, you've got God in heaven calling this meeting. Jesus Christ, the subject of the meeting. And he's brought representatives, eyewitnesses from to represent heaven. Amen. He's brought in Moses, and Elijah and earth with uh Peter, James, and John. He's got Peter, James, and John as witnesses as earthly witnesses now. And he's got heavenly witnesses with Moses which represented the dead raised and the transfigured, the translated, the the rapture. Amen. So you've got the the earthly representatives, eyewitnesses. You've got the heavenly eyewitnesses. Amen. That God has called here to this meeting. God's called this meeting Jesus subject. He's got his witnesses. Then answered fourth verse. Peter had said unto uh uh said unto Jesus,"Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here uh three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, one for Elias." While the yet spake, behold, a bright a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him." There's his adoption. Amen. There's his placement. Hear ye him. That's Jesus placement. God spoke out and said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Hear him." Now Christ is standing in that placement in the voice of God. Because God said, "Hear him." Amen. the the transformation the transition is happening. Amen. As Jesus is transfigured before them and when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face and were so afraid. And Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise, be not afraid." When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, say Jesus only. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead." Now, look what Jesus uh look what brother Brown brought as an analogy or a quote, if you will, out of this event. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Obviously, just one quote. Hear ye him. March 1960. Hear ye him. Now you see Jesus had proven to God that he had been the right kind of son and God took him up on the on on the top of the mountain brought witnesses out there as we said heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses and he clothed him in immortality. See we said it's rain white as uhh white as the light. When they looked uh when they looked up they said his garment shine like the sun. A supernatural something had taken place. His garments glistened like the sun in the middle of the day as white as they could be. God placed on him that robe of immortality, showing that he had received him. That's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth. Praise the Lord. He will call you aside, church, if you'll only obey him and stay on that word and believe it. and he will place into the church the bride I'll say before the coming of Jesus Christ that's why essential it's essential that we understand the importance of this this very subject and of our lives and of our placements we consider ourselves a portion of the body of Christ we consider ourselves a portion of the bride of Jesus Christ then we fall in this place we fall in this this comes and falls our lotment. Amen. Our responsibility to us is to him. Praise the Lord. Before the coming of Jesus Christ. So, we've got to be here at hand because we are at that coming. We are at that time. Uh I just don't see how it's prolonged much more than what it is now. He will place into the bride church. She said, "Bride." All the powers that Christ had in him will be in the bride. All the powers, let me let that sink in for a second, saints. All the power that was in Jesus Christ, Christ will place in the bride. Praise the Lord. And what is there for us then to to worry about, to fret over? But what is there for us to to to stumble to? It can't be anything that that would draw us short from recognizing our position, our placement, what God has given to us, what God has done for us. Amen. We've talked about it before in the in the early stages of this of this subject when we were talking about Adam and Eve and Adam lost what he had what God had given to him in his inheritance and recognize that as he lost it, God brought through the annals of time back to a end that was the beginning back to the end times to place back into that bride. what he lost in the beginning. What Adam had, what he could do, he could name, say, speak, he could uh call things and move things, uh name things. It was all that all the power, all the authority that God had given to Adam. See, now that all that authority is now given into the bride, even more so, saints, we can recognize as he said here, all the powers that Christ had in him will be in you. Amen. What else do we need? What else are we looking for? What other proclamation, whatever confirmation? Amen. What what do we need to get beyond the understanding scripturally of who we are in the position in Christ? Oh, praise the Lord. Don't let the devil defeat you. Amen. Don't let him try to trick you, take away your inheritance, take away your identity. He'll try to steal it from you like that. If you give him a half a second, he'll do it, too. Amen. You belong to God. You belong to Christ. and all the powers of heaven and earth. Let's continue on. All that God was, he poured into Jesus. All that Jesus was, brother Brown, I'm quoting scripture now. All that Jesus was, he poured into the church, the bride. I keep saying bride. The transformation, the larger transformation of brother Brandham transferring that verbiage over from church to bride didn't really happen until after the seals. And this was 1960. So he's still saying church here. The reference there is the bride. Amen. Not church nominal, but the bride church spiritual. Amen. All that the uh all that God was poured into Jesus, all that Jesus poured into the church bride. God wanting his work done, he sent it into his son. The son uh uh wanting the work done, sent it into the church at that wanting that work done. Well, if you if he's wanting that work done, who is he going to work that work through? Us. Amen. We are the subjects. We are the one that God is working that work through. Praise the Lord. That's what we're here for. Amen. I've told you many times, uh, I I I'm just here to want to do whatever God has for me to do. And when I'm done doing what God has for me to do, I'm ready to go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What? Whatever that calls for, whatever dictates that, but it's up to him, not me. I'm here for him, not me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm here. I'm only here for him. God wanting his work done. He sent it into his son. The son wanting his work done, sent it into you, the bride, the church. At that day, you shall know that I am in the father, father me. I in you and you in me. At that day, because the same power of God was in Jehovah, God rested in Jesus Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ rests in the placed sons. The placed sons. Shall I say again? The placed sons in the body of Christ. Praise the Lord. That brings me into the picture. I'm a part of this picture now. Glory to God. I am an earthly representative. I am an earthly eyewitness. I wasn't there maybe on that exact day, but I'm a witness of it, saints, because I'm a partaker. I'm a part of it because God brought me and made me a part of it. He brought me into this body and called me one of his. Made me a part of that promise. Now I can now we can stand upon that promise recognizing who we are. Amen. And one of the hardest things people have today is recognizing who they are. Hear ye him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, what did he go on to say in this same chapter? In this same chapter, we can scroll down and get to the 20th verse. And G 17th chapter, same chapter. Now Jesus said unto them, "Because of your unbelief, for verily I say unto you, if you have faith, the grain of a mustard seed, you shall save." Not Jesus, but you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Do you believe it? Do we believe it? &gt;&gt; We got to have faith to believe that. &gt;&gt; That's what he just told him. You don't have the faith to speak this demon out of existence. You didn't have the faith to speak to that demon and make it leave. But if you have the faith, the great of a mustard seed, you can say, praise the Lord, you shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it shall be removed. And nothing shall be impossible unto you. Not me, not him. He said you nothing shall be impossible to us that bride in the exact same chapter where he was adopted and God said hear ye him. Well what is he saying? He saying you speak to the mountain. Praise the Lord. What a beautiful transformation. God comes down, holds a meeting and says, "That's my son. I'm pleased to dwell." You listen to him now. He comes down off Mount Churchfiguration. He said, "Now I have been I have been uh uh projected." Amen. That God the Father said, "Listen to me." Amen. Now, what I'm saying to you is you speak to the mountain. Praise the Lord. I don't know what other confirmation we need. Amen. You say, he said, here you said you say. Now it's up to us. What do we say? What are we going to say about it? What do we believe about it? Is that faith the green mustard seed actually in us? Of course it is. Amen. The the scripture declares that it is that faith the grain of a mustard seed is there. And we know that he says that how about how be it though even though that faith would be there this kind comes not but by prayer and fasting. Why? Because then that's that confidence. It builds that confidence. It builds that faith. It brings that faith to a level to receive on the level Amen. of epilepsy or or or moving a mountain which they could not cure this boy of epilepsy. Amen. Say to this mountain, you speak now. You can say what do we do with it? Are we going to speak it? Are we going to say it? Is it going to be what? But now when we speak it, it's only going to be spoke not on our human emotion. It's not going to be spoke on our human feelings. It's not going to be spoke on what we want done or what our human feelings or emotions might dictate. Amen. to say, uh, for example, I'll go back to my sister, my fleshly human person, Newton Bennett, wanted my sister Janice, to stay on this earth, to be my sister, to continue to live. It seemed like to me she had a lot more in life to do, a lot more accomplished. She was only 48, &gt;&gt; 47. &gt;&gt; She was only 48. 48 I'm over 10 years older than she was when she passed. You think she's got plenty, but she's my sister and I love her. I want her to stay here. I don't want her to go. So, I prayed for God's healing. The Lord heal her. But I've told you the story when I was coming down Interstate 40 towards Hullbrook from Flagstaff. I I pray I prayed for her like I had done. I was playing the tape, listened on the radio on the not radio, but the the radio a tape and I was and I started and she came to my mind. I started praying for her and the Lord stopped stopped me and said, "Don't pray for her." Amen. And again, baffling. But see, when God speaks, you know what to say then. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know how to pray. You know what to say. And we don't do it based on our human emotion or feelings or what we want. We do it based on what his purpose is, what he wants done. That's what we're here for. And when God said, "Don't pray for it's her time for me to uh for me to take bring her home." That was it for me. Amen. I ne I never prayed for my sister's healing from that moment forward because it wasn't I it's not my will I want. It's his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. And unless I know that that God says this is this is the will that I want that's going to happen, then I pray what the scripture says. And the scripture says, "Pray for the sick, lay hands on uh and they shall be well," I take that. But if somebody comes up and the Lord says, "No, you know, I've had people come up before me and they've come up for prayer and I just the Lord speaks to me and I just I lay hands and I and I I just pray uh general God's blessings on them. I I've had to do that a couple of times. It's not a lot, but a couple of times I didn't pray for them to be healed. They come up for for healing to be healed, but the Lord told me not to. Amen. So, I don't. Brother Ram says if you if God puts God sometimes will put some a sickness or something on somebody to bring them back to him or to teach them a lesson or something, God might allow that to be on them. He doesn't put them on it, but he might allow that to come on that person to teach them a lesson or bring them back to him. I remember a brother uh a very well-known minister well y'all might not know him but from Tennessee u and he was up hunting one time and he fell off out of the tree and broke his back and his testimony later was I didn't know God I didn't know this message he preached for years but he said I didn't know God and I didn't know this message until God put me flat on my back and when I was flat on my back that's where he found God amen who knows why God does the things he does But we want to be there to be representatives of his. We don't be want to be there to contrary what God is trying to do. So, Brother Brandham said, if God put that sickness on them or or whatever it is to teach them a lesson or bring them along or something and you go and pray that off of them, then you're responsible for it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that I don't want to be responsible for. I don't think any of us do. But unless God does that, we just believe with the scripture just as lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. That's what we do. Amen. Pray for them. That's what we do. Because that's what the scripture says. Unless it's something different, then that's what we do. Amen. But we do it in accordance to God's word. Not what we want. Amen. But what God's word wants. How many times have I said that we may pray for God, pray for something from God and pray it and want something to happen and want God to do it and God's trying to do it and he's working in a way that you never imagined would happen and and you you pray another way or you want a certain way or something and God's trying to work God's trying to work out your prayer request and and you're hindering it because he's not doing it the way you wanted him to do it or the way that you expected him to do But just let God do the work. That that's the main thing. Just let him do the work. So so many times God is working on your behalf and you don't even realize it. Sometimes he's working on our behalf and we don't like the way he's working it. Who cares how he does it as long as it gets done because the end result is what we want the most anyway, right? &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. That's what we want from God is the end result. Amen. God being transfigured before them. Let's go over to Philippians. Now, I want to continue this subject. I want to try to build these together before we leave. Philippians chapter 2. I hope we've at least garnered a portion of understanding what we're what we're talking about and bringing this together. Amen. Wasn't just Jesus that was adopted. It wasn't just Jesus that was to speak. Amen. It brings us together down to here for us today. That's why there were earthly representatives there. Amen. To represent those of us who are still here living here. Philippians chapter 2. Very familiar scripture. One of my favorites actually. Philippians 2. We'll just let's skip down instead of u uh well, let me just read through quickly the first verse. I just love it all. So if there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bows and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind, let's just let's look here now. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. That form is amorpha. Amen. Which we've discussed many times. To amorpha. Amen. Same person, two different masks. That's what it that's what it represent. Not two different people. That's where so many people get lost or mixed up in their Trinity doctrine. They think it's different people. It's not different people. It's not different personalities. It's one God. Amen. In these different offices, he's changing his mask. Amen. Because he's God. He can do that. Amen. He God is not limited to your scientific or medical proof. Amen. God is not limited to what your mind could imagine him to be. God is unimaginably uh beyond anything we can comprehend. Who being in the form of God thought it not Robert to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant. Took upon him the form of a servant. was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, becoming a servant. Amen. having the mind of God, being in the form immora of God, thought it not rather to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, become a servant, humbled himself to death the death of the cross. Therefore, or wherefore God also hath mightily exalted him and given him a name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in uh heaven and things in earth and things under the earth, that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Amen. Transformed, immorphed in the form of God as a servant. Amen. As a servant. Let's go over to Galatians real quick. Galatians chapter 4. And then Galatians 4:1. Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, giveth nothing from a servant. Now he's the heir. Praise. He's the posterity. But as long as he is a child, giveth nothing from a servant. Amen. From a servant. What did Jesus do? Put on the form of a servant. Morphet God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Though he be lord of all, but is under tutors, governors until the time appointed of the father. Even so in the the dispensation of times. Amen. which we keep in mind as we continue on this. Even so, we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of time was come, or when it unfolded to bring this to pass, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. Praise the Lord. that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying aba father. There it is again. Paul using that in Romans and now in Galatians. Wherefore, father, father, see thou art my father, right? Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son. And if a son then an heir of God through Christ who himself took on the form of a servant. Amen. And became obedient even to the death of the cross became obedient as a servant. Amen. But as it as it issued forth, as we grow and grow in Christ and take on the form of God, baptize, receive the Holy Ghost, new birth, we continue to live and continue to do. God places us, God puts us in the placement where he wants us to be. Amen. I believe I told you it was it was a little while a several months after I believed receive being baptized and receiving the Holy Ghost that I felt a calling on my life to to minister. And then it was four years I believe it was four or six years something like that even after that where I felt like the Lord called me to be a pastor part of the ministry. Amen. As God continued to unfold this, you say, "God knows what you're going to be. God knows who you're going to be. God knows what you're going to do." Absolutely. But you, we have to go through that process to get us to the fullness of that time. And when the fullness of that time comes, then God places you and puts you in that position at that time. When that time unfolds, just like he did Christ, he does the same thing for us. Amen. He shows us that same thing. He reveals to us that same thing. Amen. Imorph as a servant, though he be Lord of all, immort. Praise the Lord. That's what he did for us. Amen. Now, look at this in Romans. Let's go back to Romans if we could. Chapter 12. Romans chapter 12. Praise the Lord. Romans chapter 12. I'm just going to uh read one verse. Romans 12:2. Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed. Be ye you. Amen. Yes. Jesus had his mount transfiguration experience. But you know the same word is transformed is the same word as transfigured. So as Christ had his mount of transfiguration experience, the Bible Paul inspiration to Romans is to the Roman church is telling them to not not conform themselves to the world. Amen. But to be transformed by the renewing of your mind to have that transfiguration experience yourself. Now God may not as you could see visibly or audibly have Moses and Elijah and Peter, James and John, but the same experience takes place in every one of us like it did Christ. A transfiguration be transformed. Same word. Amen. Again, same word. Go look at the Greek. Same word. Transfigured. Transformed. Same word. to be transformed. Amen. By the renewing of your mind, the renewing of your mind in morphing. That you may be uh that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. We transform. We are to have our own transfiguration experience. mount of transfiguration experience where God is placing you placing of the sons. That's why we want have this as our position in Christ to place you to have that same experience. Amen. To have that same experience as Jesus said here you you say amen. That's why brother Brandham said, "God is pleased to honor your word." Amen. Because it places you in that position. The adoption puts you in that position. Praise the Lord. Now, let's go look at um Ephesians. Ephesians chapter one. I got a couple more scriptures I want to make this point with if we can here. Give me a minute. Praise the Lord. We all had that experience, saints. We all had that time, that experience where God places that in us. I don't know that people call it uh in the world would use maybe the word epiphany. People say, "I had an epiphany." Uh, that's a really strange word to hear or say in my opinion. Uh, what an epiphany is, basically, what an epiphany is is simply an enlightenment. It just means that some some light has come down that something that you didn't see before, now you can see it. It brings you into another level of recognition. Whatever it is, the world uses the word epiphany. I came to an epiphany. Uh, again, real weird word to me. Epiphany. Anyway, the world the the world comes to an epiphany. You come to a place of revelation where God reveals to you what it is. and something that maybe was previously hidden to you, something that you may not have recognized before, God brings light upon that and shines it to you and shows to you that whatever it is. Amen. This position, this place, that's nothing more than a transfiguration, a transforming from that point transformed you and and put you in that place, in that position. Look friends, whether whether you're sinner or saint, whether you're godly, ungodly, whether you're an atheist, agnostic or Christian, whether you're Catholic or uh Buddhist or what the whole world, I don't believe there's a single person in this world that does not want to know what their purpose in life is. &gt;&gt; That does not want to know why they're here. What are you on this earth for? What are what po p purpose are you supposed to fulfill? Again, I I think the world is so devoid of that today. That's why you see a lot of the homeless people we see. They have no purpose. They don't know what their purpose is. That's why you see a lot of people that don't don't don't know their position even in Christ or in even in a church going to a church. Amen. There's involvement. There's position. There's uh there's there's a placement. There's a belonging to people want to belong to something. They want to be a part of something. They want to be involved in something. Amen. And and and so many people today, they don't even they don't even know what that is. They don't know who they are. They don't know why they're here. They don't know what their point in life is. Are they just supposed to heat up a frozen sidewalk? Are they supposed to just be a good graphic artist on the signs, please help, or something? what what is that purpose? They don't know. So many people that if they knew if they were given a purpose and had a purpose and see that's that just goes I I know I'm prolonging this. I'm sorry. That just goes right back to the the the pure u obliteration the pure uh uh misunderstanding of love. People have pe people have have so uh abused and misused the word love. They have no the world has no idea what love what true love really is. They don't know. Amen. And so they say, "Well, let let's just leave these people alone and and just uh patronize them or something." That's showing love. No. No. Not to me. Amen. You think God would do that if you did that spiritually? If you belong to him, God's going to give you some good protoplasm stimulation and get you up off your butt and put you to work and make you do something and have a purpose in life and do something with yourself and live the life you're supposed to live. Be the person you're supposed to be. But no, humans, they're just, you know, that's okay. No, there there's there should be a purpose for this person lay out on the ground out here. &gt;&gt; They should be able to fulfill a purpose. They should be a contributor to this humanity and to this country. Amen. That's my place. But they don't have any. And people love them so much to just leave them. You know, there just all hogwash. That's the devil's love. That's look friend. To me, that's not even felio love. Much less. That's barely a passive hatred for people to just leave them out like that. I I just don't understand that. But anyway, that's that's the people they don't know what their position is. When you as a Christian come to that place, to that epiphany, that revelation of what that placement is. I think brother Brandham came to that place. I know he did. Amen. Now, I may be misguided on what that might have been, but I I absolutely believe he did. But let's let's read. I had you turn to Ephesians. Let's read this. Ephesians 1. Maybe we'll get to the other. If we don't, we'll get to the the things that show what I just said to try to help prove that out a little bit. At least my opinion. Ephesians 1:1, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by what? The will of God. Why? Because that's the only reason Paul was here. It's the only reason any of us should understand to believe that we're here is because we're here to do the will of God. To the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from God our father from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed. Now just because he said and doesn't mean there's a God and a father. Doesn't mean there's two people. Amen. But even trinitarians believe God was the father. But you look at the scripture, it says, "And does that make it two people?" Amen. If if if the truth is hid, I'm going to say this. It's a hard saying, but it's very true because it's scripture. If it is hid, it is hid to those that are lost. God help us. But look, blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen. And where do we heard that? Where did we hear that word before? Amen. We went back first Peter. Amen. Make sure you're calling an election. You're calling. You're choosing. Remember what election was? Choosing. Handpicking. God chose you. God handpicked you. Praise the Lord. specifically, purposely to do his will, to do whatever that purpose of will he has for you on this earth. He chose you for that. That's your election. Praise the Lord. So this chosen means election. God picked you. Chosen God. He has according as he hath chosen us in him. Elected us, chose us. And remember, if you stand in that election, you stand in that call, you can not fall. &gt;&gt; Cannot fall. Period. If it's in God, you can not fall. &gt;&gt; Now, if it's man-made or if it's somebody just doing what they think they want to do or what they're good at or something, it's it's all man-made, that'll fall. They can fall. But if it's in Christ, it can not fall. Praise the Lord. Chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Having predestinated. Hallelujah. Predestin. I wonder how many churches actually even use the word predestinated anymore. such confusion, such misunderstanding, such lack of revelation of what predestination is that we should be holy without uh blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto unto the adoption. So, we're predestined to this position of children by Jesus Christ to himself to himself. So, you see where we're adopted now. We're adopted by predestination to him according to his good pleasure. So our adoption and placement isn't for our pleasure. It isn't for our will. It's to do his will. It's for his good pleasure, not ours. So when we say when I say that I'm here for him, that's exactly what I mean. When we as Christians are here for him, that's exactly what we need. We're here according to his purpose. Praise the Lord. To do what he wants, not me, not us. Him. Praise the Lord. To by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. That was by predestination. Praise the Lord. to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins to the riches of his grace. Amen. By the blood. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for that precious blood brought redemption, wherein he hath provided toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself. And how can we do it if he doesn't reveal it to us? It's no longer a mystery. If it were a mystery, how would we be able to fulfill it if we don't know what it is? So he's revealed it to us so that we know so that God's shown it and revealed it to us. Amen. The mystery of his will that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance. Praise the Lord. being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise after you believe sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance down payment until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory which is adoption is all about. Amen. To with the redemption of our bodies. Praise God. That's what that's the placement. That's our that's what our placement is for. Praise the Lord. and have an inheritance that we become the individual to do his will to the praise of his glory because we have obtained that inheritance through predestination. Amen. Anybody have a different translation than the King James? Amen. I just wonder I I I I think I have made with one or two Bibles at home. I want to look and see if they even took the word predestination. Now, I bet you most of the I would venture to guess that most of the uh newer translations probably take out the word predestinated anyway, but in God's mind, predestinated to work all things after the counsel of his will. And he's put in us his spirit to be able to do that, to be able to live that, to be able to be that person. Now, let's go to one more. I think I'm going to I'll close after this. I won't get to the other I wanted to today, but we'll get to this. Hopefully, this will settle this for me, for you, for us. And the transformation. Amen. The transfiguring of recognizing, yes, Jesus had his transfiguration experience, but what about my transformation experience? What about my being transformed? Praise the Lord. do the will of God by his purpose, according to his purpose. Now, Romans 8, a very, very familiar scripture reading, verse 8 20 uh verse 28. Romans 8:28. And we know that all things work together for the good for good to them that love God. Now, that's the first thing. We know that he works all things together for our good because we love him. Amen. Not not a passing uh fancy, not a not some kind of a human love or some kind of an affinity for God, but a true agapeo love. If you see that word love in this scripture, it is agapeo. If you take that word love back to the Greek, that love in the scripture is agapo. It's God's love. It's unchanging love. Amen. Because we love God. It's the same love that Brother Brandon was speaking of when he said, "If God would sentence me to hell, I would still love him. If I go the way I am now, I would still love him even in hell." Why? Because even the circumstances of being in hell would not change his love for God. And if you've got that true agop love, it wouldn't change for any of us either. No matter what God does. So many people come along and they get hit with some kind of a a test or trial or something and first thing you know they're all say, "Why would God have let this happen? Why would God allow this to happen? What kind of a God would do this to people?" You hear that all the time. Said, "What kind of a God?" It probably happened even in these floods that just came. What kind of a God these people serve that would let that a god that would let them just be swept away like that? &gt;&gt; I'm sure I haven't heard any. I was working all week, so I didn't hear much news. But, uh, I'm sure there's people out there, especially all the uh, other different networks that are not really godly networks that are like, you know, what kind of a God these people serve and just, well, they they got what they I even heard one woman, they said one woman said they got what they deserved. I I just I I just fortunately the company that had employed that woman fired her and she was a pediatrician. I'm like who who would even say that? I mean what human being would say something like that? I I don't want to greater or less than a human because she's not less than a human. But that statement was less than human. Amen. But people do that. What kind of a God would do this? What you know? They leave. First thing they do, they leave God. They don't trust God. Don't believe God. Well, they never loved him to begin with. Amen. If you really love God, no matter what God puts you through, no matter what God's sending you to or what God calls you to or where God's sending you, you still love him with the same love that you've always loved him with. The love does not change. That love will cause God. He makes all things work together for our good because we love him like that. Amen. Because we love God to them. Look now to them who are the called according to his purpose. There we go again. Amen. Paul sure likes to make sure we understand it was for his purpose and not ours. Amen. Called. C called. C called. Election. Called. Chosen. God picked us for whom he did forno. Amen. which is the beginning of predestination if you will. For whom he did forno this is the 29th verse now for whom he did forno he also did predestinate so how did he predestinate by his fornowledge god didn't just come down arbitrarily and just laugh and say I'm going to make this person do this I'm going to make this person go do that no anyway by his fornowledge predestinated to be conformed conformed to the image. Now this conformed is not the same conformed as in uh Romans 12 when he said be not conformed to the world. That was a that was like a a scheme if you will if you go to look in the Greek was a scheme. But this conform is the same the same derivative same uh word as transformed. Transformed and conformed here are the same. So it's it's kind of mixed up when you look at the English language. But you got to understand he's saying two different when he says conformed here and he's saying conformed in the 12th chapter he's using two different words actually. One is a scheme and the other is a transforming. Amen. A renewing. Praise the Lord. Not esteemed uh uh by the Holy Ghost. He He did also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them he also called. Sounds a lot like first Corinth of Ephesians chapter 1, doesn't it? The moreover, who he predestinated, he called. Whom he called, them he justified. Whom he justified, he's glored. To them, he also glorified. What shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us. Praise the Lord. You can never fall. If these things are true, your calling and election is sure, you can not fall. God makes everything. Let's tie first Peter and Romans 8 together. Now, he makes everything work together for your good. And if your calling and election is short, you can not fall. He has conformed you, transformed you, brought you in a transfigured uh uh transfiguration to bring you to the same place that God did Jesus there on that mountain. You've come, you come to that revelation. I'm not going to say epiphany anymore. Revelation. You've come to that revelation. Found your position in Christ. Amen. And and it's not based on age. It's not based on size. It's not based on your reent relevance in church. God can place Gabriel right now if he wants. That's up to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. age doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; That that's that's up to the Lord. Amen. And where he brings each of us along. But he makes everything work together for our good. Our calling and election is sure. We cannot fall. Amen. We're in the place that God has called us, predestinated us, conformed us, uh elected us, chosen us. I don't what other adjectives do we need to to describe to understand who we are in Christ and our position in him. Praise the Lord. It just comes just as God just as God delivers it, just as God brings it. And come to that understanding, come to that revelation. Amen. God has called me. God has positioned me. God has placed me. God, God has a purpose for me. We talked about the little wa wash woman. Amen. That woman will get credit on the other side for those half a million souls that Dwight movie led to Christ. She'll get credit for him because she was the one that did something and and who knows what else. Probably nothing else happened to that lady in her life. You'd think significant like that. But we are here to fulfill our position, our placement, what God's put us. What is our position in Christ? I think it's as paramount more now than has ever been. That we recognize where God has placed us. Amen. Praise the Lord. In this life, in in in his body. Amen. That we can never fall. God will make everything work together for our good because we love him. Amen. We love him. He loves us and his love for us is unconditional. Amen. The only reason our love could be unconditional for him is because he started it. He started it. It was him that started this. His love for us has always been unconditional. We come to a revelation one day that our love and and our position in him is I love him regardless. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we could. I was hoping to get to this other part, but I that's that was the main of what I wanted to say and bring forth today as God would show it to us. Amen. Because it's him that does it. It's him that brings us to this place. And we are so close, friend. I believe we are so very close to the coming of the Lord. We are so very close to seeing our loved ones appear before us. We're so very close to a transformation, to a a a rapture, a changing of the body. Amen. A going to the air to meet him. This bride is going to be in her place. Amen. It's like we said before, God is not coming for a deformed body. He's coming for a complete mature woman. Amen. She's not going to be missing a leg. an arm, foot, an ear, an eye. She's going to be complete and each part in its place, in its position, playing its part. Praise the Lord. And even if you have to be the bottom of uh what is it, Brother Null said, the the skin on the bottom of your foot. Amen. You're still a part of the body. Praise the Lord. I'm so thankful for that. Amen. Let's sing that. Uh we'll just sing the chorus portion of it. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. Amen. Shall we turn? Is it on there or should I should we get our books out? Amen. So glad to be a part of the family of God. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Let's sing this just the chorus part. We'll sing. We will sing the verses. I'm so glad to be a part of the family of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood. joiners with Jesus as we travel this song. For I'm a part of the family, the family of God. Oh, I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain. Cleansed by his blood. Join us with Jesus as we travel this song. I'm a part of the family. The family. Oh, one more time now. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by his blood. Joiners with Jesus as we travel this song. for I'm a part of the family, the family of God. Amen. I'm so glad I'm a part. Praise the Lord. I'm glad I'm a part of your home, your families. I'm glad you're a part of ours. We're all a part of the family of God because we're all one in him. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you today. Pray something was said to bless and strengthen the Lord today. Good to see each one of you here for streaming. God bless you. Amen. Appreciate the Lord's goodness to us and blessing us. Amen. Through another week. We don't know that we'll ever meet like this again, but if we do, we'll come back again and rejoicing and being thankful for what God for what the Lord has done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Lord willing, we I will probably have to move next service up again to 10 o'clock. Um sorry if that becomes a burden to you. I apologize. Uh but uh the flight I'm going back to Houston. So the flight I will have is uh is going to be like a one:00 flight. So uh probably have to leave out pretty quick again. So I appreciate your indulgence in that. So Lord willing I will text everybody probably let or try to remember. If I don't, my wife always reminds me um to text everybody, let everybody know Saturday to make absolutely sure uh this service will be at 10:00 next Sunday. Uh so please remember that. Amen. Happy birthday to America. Fourth of July is done gone by. We're on the fourth and uh we had the fourth and then all of a sudden now we're what is the day? 15th or something. Just flew by. Amen.
