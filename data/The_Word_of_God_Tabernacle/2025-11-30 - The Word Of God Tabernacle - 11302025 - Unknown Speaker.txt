Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people try to make Jesus a part of their lifestyle. You notice in the world today, as we've said several times, seems to be a surge of people that are wanting to come and wanting to receive and wanting to get and become a part of that. Amen. But you know, re uh Matthew 25 tells us that they would. &gt;&gt; Amen. They would come after that oil. They would come after that. But &gt;&gt; a lot of people want to make Jesus a part of their life. Amen. That's I guess that's all well and good, but to me, if G Jesus is my life, &gt;&gt; Jesus isn't a part of my life.

Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't look to see it. Amen. I don't see any prayer requests over there. I got a couple prayer requests to bring your attention here today. Amen. Uh got a text earlier uh this morning from brother Danny. He said he had his work some work done to his foot uh this week and he's uh in a lot of pain or in in some pain. So he thought he would stay off of it. Stay home today streaming. So if you're streaming, God bless you, brother Danny. I know that when Danny usually when Danny's not here, he is streaming. So &gt;&gt; Amen. Um he is faithful for that. So, God bless you, brother, if you're watching today. So, please remember him in prayer. He put this word down that they did to his foot. I have no idea what it is. So, uh there's no sense of me trying to act like a doctor. So, he just had some work done to his foot. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; They trimmed the dead skin. &gt;&gt; Okay. I didn't really need to hear that, [laughter] honestly. At least we're not at lunch. He had some work done to his foot, so he's in some pain. Uh so please remember him in prayer. Uh sitting off his foot today. So thankful brother Dennis is with us. Amen. Is your foot getting better, brother? &gt;&gt; It's getting better. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Last time we had lunch together, he said it was getting better. So it's getting better. We had prayer here. Amen. And so thankful that uh uh brother Dennis is getting better as well. Also got a text from Sister Julie. Um, uh, I don't know how much of her text she would like for me to bring to your attention today, but, uh, she didn't sleep well last night. She's extremely nauseated this morning. She was still going to try to come if she could. The nausea left her, uh, but she's just, uh, having, well, I just say it. I mean, we're all adults. Well, except for Gabriel and Alice, but, um, uh, she's having some very severe menopausal symptoms. So, just please remember her in prayer. uh the Lord would just help her, touch her, get her through that, take it from her. Uh whatever the situation is, she said she misses us so very much and she wants to be back in church. Uh it just seems like one thing just one attack after the other. Amen. So any of you have experienced it or been through it or been a part of someone who's been through it, um uh please you can obviously enter into prayer for Sister Julie in that situation. So please remember her. Amen. remember of of course the Pats with us again today and I think this is Anna's day to work so Anna Steven Madison are not with us and as we said sister Julie the Zenas who I'm assuming hopefully in another month or so will be with us so remember them in prayer as well we're thankful that the Lord Jesus is with us amen and that's all we need praise the Lord amen so anyone have a spoken request or anything in your brothers. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, some of y'all know my sister Arlene. Um, she's been losing a lot of weight. I mean, she is really thin now. And, um, uh, Leah, who's a nurse, um, told her there's something just not right. Well, she took one of those things, you know, you sent in for check your colon and, you know, Colag guard &gt;&gt; and they found some blood &gt;&gt; and she's very concerned. &gt;&gt; Well, because of what I went through, &gt;&gt; that's exactly what what they found out about myself. &gt;&gt; She has to have a colonoscopy. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And we're praying that all will be well. There's it's not all only cancer, you know, of there's olives, there's there's different So, we're praying that all would go well. Glory to &gt;&gt; God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yes. Let's remember. I was going to ask you if it was if she was on the dietary reason she lose weight, but apparently not. So, remember brother Dennis sister in prayer if you would. Sister &gt;&gt; did. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. precious brother Paul. Love our brother, sister Margaret very much. Miss him so much. But please remember, brother Paul, he's had this dealing and this battle with this cancer for a little while now. He's kind of been up and down. His numbers go down and they go back up. And as you heard Sister Sheilia say, uh his numbers uh went back up. So he's starting chemotherapy again. Is he doing radiation too or just chemo? You know, probably just chemo more than likely in this circumstance. Yeah. So, so please remember brother Paul in prayer as well. Have an unspoken request on your heart. He knows our hearts. Amen. So, very thankful for that. Let's send to our feet if we could. Thankful the Lord Jesus mindful of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As brother Dennis, if you take these things to the Lord for us. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, it's an honor once again to be in your house. Yes. &gt;&gt; House of worship, a house of prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, I totally in agreement with what the pastor just said. &gt;&gt; Being a servant of yours, it's not a lifestyle. It's not a a club that we've joined or a popularity that's amongst the people. &gt;&gt; It's your life, Father, living in us. It gives us the hope of &gt;&gt; salvation, the hope of eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I heard your prophet say earlier this week, you're not even saved until you're born again. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's why you see a lot of so-called Christians saying, "I love God." And they're doing things of the world. They're praying in titles. They're living in sin. They're living in adultery. They're living in fornication. And they believe within their heart, they're religious. They're going to make it. AND YOUR PROPHET TAUGHT THE GREATEST DECEPTION in this world. is a religious deception where PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH RELIGION LIKE THE PROPHET SAID JUST TO MAKE THEMSELVES MISERABLE. IT'S TIME TO REPENT AND GET RIGHT WITH GOD. LORD, I I read this morning how you told us to pray and that we may not enter into temptation. To pray, Father, that we can grow deeper in your love. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; To pray, Father, that we will not miss YOUR COMING BECAUSE YOU'LL COME as a thief in the night. &gt;&gt; JESUS, &gt;&gt; YOUR PROPHET EVEN TAUGHT US, FATHER, HOW DO you grow deeper in the love of God? He said, real simple, &gt;&gt; pray and read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING on even amongst the followers of this message. They lacked the ability that that simple um SITUATION IN THEIR LIFE where they're born again for when it comes to lining up to your word. If you're truly LIVING IN US, IT'S AUTOMATIC. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S AUTOMATIC. IT'S A PROPHECY OF HIS CHRIST is truly IN OUR HEART. WE CAN'T wait for those church doors to OPEN UP. IT'S AUTOMATIC TO give you the 10% in offerings. IT'S AUTOMATIC TO PRAY. It's automatic to love one another. It's automatic to just &gt;&gt; fulfill your word to be written epistles read and known of all men. YES. &gt;&gt; AND FATHER, THERE ARE NEEDS amongst your body this morning. Lord, there are several that need a healing touch. my brother and sister Julie and Lord uh our brother Sar and different ones I can't remember them all but you know them father they were expressed they they were read out loud you're mindful of each and everyone you're not partial towards anyone we call you on the scene our great physician our high priest that can be touched but the feelings of our infirmities. And by your stripes, we are healed. And we believe deliverance. We believe all that we have need of. This is testing time. THE TEMPTATIONS ARE COMING. THE TESTS ARE COMING. BUT GREATER HE IS IN us than he is in the world. Put Jesus first. We must put you first in everything. You must have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. and all the unspoken prayer requests. You know, each and every heart, may you grant to them whatever they have need of um more so than than what they can ever expect to receive from you. Amen. For your gracious and loving God. And Lord, bless our pastor as he labors faithfully to bring forth your word. Lord, use them to speak to our hearts. We want to be ready, Father. We want to be prayed up.

The Fridays I go and see my podiatrist. I'm seeing a new one. And he does that where he trims all the disc in and all. And um Friday night I was in such pain I couldn't sleep all night. So yesterday I spent a lot of time just resting and I prayed Lord I want to go to church. Don't let me have a painful night. I won't be able to go.

Anyone else? Amen. If not, let's stand to our feet. Amen. We'll go right to the scripture here. We're going to go over to Romans chapter 8. Amen. We're going to get back on to uh the subject we had left off of. This will be adoption part 32, five-fold ministry part five. Amen. And this will be the subtext of apostles. We're going to try to start delving into the powerful ministry here for the next few services. And the first one we're going to take is apostles uh or missionaries, whichever way a person wants to say that. Uh as we'll be here in a minute, we find out that they're one and the same. Apostle, missionary, same thing. Amen. And you'll also see when I read my first quote here from Brother Brandham, why we picked apostles to be the first. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but Romans chapter 8, as we are back into our adoption here now after a couple of services, uh I want to go to the 14th ch uh 14th vers 8th chapter, 14th verse. Amen. And read this again before we go over to Ephesians 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we do, let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer. Father, we're so very thankful again of Lord those that have come, Lord, and the songs that we sung and just to worship you and praise you, Father, and just create an atmosphere in a way that Lord, you do feel welcome, God, to be here because you inhabit the praises of your people. And we know Lord as we are praising, worshiping you, giving you thanksgiving with the fruit of our lips, lifting you up, God, and praising you in worship with all that we have, Father, and our the strength of our being, Father, and all the ways that we know how to be able to verbalize it and to move our bodies and to raise our hands and just to worship you, Lord Jesus. We just trust and believe. Know, God, that you are here. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. We don't need a tingle down our spine or our hair growing on end or we just need to know that your word says that you would be here, Father. Yes. Two or three are gathered in your name and we are here in your name, Lord. Not in the name of a denomination, not in the name of a pastor, but we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you promised in that name, Father, there's power, there's strength, there's healing, God. And in that name is where you will meet the worshipper, Father. And we are your worshippers today. and trust and believe, God, in your house here today, in your house. Yes. God, we meet with you. We thank you, Father, for this word. As we pull back the pages of this word, may you just reveal it to our hearts. Help us to see and know and hear what you would have us to know today, God. Bless us by it as we commit it into your hands. Speak through these lips, Lord. &gt;&gt; Only the words that you would be heard today, God, and anoint our ears to receive it. Let it not return void. accomplish that in each that you desired for it to before the foundation of the world. We commit it to your hands now asking your uh your blessings upon it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans chapter 8 verse14 as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. I love that. We are the children of God. And if children then hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. I like the other day when brother Ze was here, he read that scripture too. of all the scriptures in the Bible, he took that scripture as a part of his reading and read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let you know the Lord is mindful of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Does me. Praise the Lord. Now, let's go to Ephesians chapter 4. We're going to uh start here. Go back into the uh the five-fold ministry. Ephesians chapter 4. I want to read just those few verses of scripture. We we've gone through most of this fourth chapter and of course the latter part of it and recognizing the things the purposes of that ministry, the reason the Lord's put this ministry in our lives and and recognize that the that that a God- called minister is a carrier of the gospel and the gospel is the good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring good news, to bring good tidings to his people. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why the Lord, that's one reason the Lord gives them gives to us, that ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, let's go over Ephesians 4. Uh, we'll just begin reading with verse 11. And he and he gave. Now, I want you to notice here as we as we've it's been a few weeks, so we'll go back. And he Amen. That is God. Praise the Lord. Not a man, not a church. Amen. not a person, not by laying on of hands, which a lot of people, a lot of apostolics, even um Pentecostals took from the laying on of hands that they believe they were imparting the gift to someone. That is not it. Amen. Brother Brandham teaches very uh uh very well, very correctly, soundly that the laying on of hand is just an acknowledgement. Amen. I forgot. trying to remember what uh what message it is that brother Bham um is trying to hurry. They're on they're on the hookup and uh a brother had brother Brandham had I guess had um told this brother he would he would dedicate he would not dedicate but he would um uh uh anoint him. He would lay hands on him. He would um what's it called? Minister, anoint &gt;&gt; No, it was ordained. &gt;&gt; Ordain, lay hands on to as an as a sign of ordination. And brother Brandham comes and he has other brothers come up and lay hands on and another brother comes and another brother comes and it's like there's like 15 brothers in the first 30 minutes of this tape come up to be have a hands laid on and reckon. But brother Brandham in that tape he made sure to that we understand that it wasn't imparting the gift of anything on that person but in the recognition that God has given that gift to that person. It's an acknowledgment, an ordination, acknowledgment of recognition that we that we recognize or those around or those that we trust and believe to be godly people uh recognize and see there's a gift on this person. And that laying on of hands is simply an acknowledgment of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Bible says he [snorts] gave. That's God. Not us. Not a man, not a preacher, not a prophet, not a a a church, but God. Amen. God is the one that does it. Praise the Lord. So you say, "Well, why is that so important, Brother New Mute?" Because because it has to be God sent or it's man-made. &gt;&gt; And if it's not God sent, it's man-made, then it it it results in nothing. Amen. a disaster, it it results in nothing but a a should I say a a faster, easier path to hell. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When someone's not called of God, someone's not called of God, like we said before, God's not obligated to keep that person on the word. If that person's ministering and they're not obligate, God's not obligated to keep that person on the word and they're ministering and not on the word, then where does that lead? right? &gt;&gt; That leads them astray from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is a church? If we don't have the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh if you don't have the message of the hour, the truth of your day, if you don't have the word of God in a church, then we are exactly what brother Brandham said we were. And brother Green iterated many times. We are nothing but a lot. We are nothing but a building where people of like opinion drift together to find out what's for lunch or what they're wearing or what they did this week or what their opinion might be or what this we just become a lodge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without that the if the if the church is devoid of the word then what do we have? It's if it's devoid of the word IT'S DEVOID OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It must have the word. It must have the purity of the word. I was talking to a brother the other day and he was talking about how some of the things of the world are creeping into the people and their dress and stuff like that. I said, "Well, the the the if the if the pure unadulterated word is not preached, then that's going to happen." &gt;&gt; Yes. It doesn't matter if you you don't have I don't have to stand up here every single service and pound you about how you dress and pound you about how your hair is supposed to be and pound you about how what you how you're supposed to live and you don't that doesn't have to be done because the pure word corrects the error. Word always corrects error. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't have to be said every single time. It's the spirit that comes and that spirit is what anoints and what brings that word alive to the people that changes their lives. And when the word changes the life, then you don't have to worry about a man doing anything or someone coming and and having to berate you about something all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, because the word, the purity of the word, the Holy Spirit is there. &gt;&gt; Yes. When the Holy Spirit is there, then the whole atmosphere changes, lives change, hearts change, people change. Amen. Your life will be different when God comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When he gives, it's he, God. God's the one that does this. God's the call. He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, who we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God the the reasons God gave that five-fold ministry. Now, as we said, we want to start with the we want to start with the five-fold uh with the apostle and the five-fold ministry. But before we do that, I want to show you again as many of you have already know, I want to I want to show again and illustrate. Maybe somebody who's watching may not have ever seen it or may watch it archived what brother Brandham taught brother Green, what brother Green taught me. Amen. And I say he may have taught others. I don't know. May have shown to others. I don't know. But I know he did me. And I'll never forget the first time brother Green showed me. We were in town visiting. I was pastoring in St. Augustine, Florida. And we come in December to visit. We went to the IHOP on Grant Road to have dinner. Brother Green was sitting there with a lot of people. And we we had got up and different ones were talking to him. You know, he was, you know, Brother Green just had that personality. People gravitated to him. Everybody was talking to him and things and uh he stopped me and he grabbed me by the arm and we started talking. I was just standing he was sitting there. I was standing there right next to him and for some reason we got on this subject and he showed me the thing that brother Brandham showed him about the five-fold ministry. I don't remember why or we were talking about the five-fold ministry but he showed me what brother Brandham showed him. The five-fold ministry is like your hand. the five-fold ministry. There's five fingers uh on on on your hand that represents the five-fold ministry. He said now the each one brother Brandham taught him identified a ministry. Uh the first ministry, the first one was a prophet. Amen. The index finger is a prophet. Thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said when a prophet says thus sayeth the Lord, it's thus sayeth the Lord. the prophet. Amen. The second is the teacher uh uh the apostle. Amen. The apostles usually if you put your hand up, you'll notice almost every hand, if not every hand, this finger, what do you call that? That finger, it's not the ring finger. I can't I forget the name of that finger. Anyway, that finger is almost always the longest finger. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which means that when the hand goes out, that's the first finger that meets them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes that the apostle, the missionary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The the one that goes in first. Amen. Into a church, into an area, into a place to try to establish Amen. Remember when uh excuse me, you remember when uh uh brother Green uh baptized brother Galdona? Uh, brother Van told that testimony. I've heard it I don't know how many times. It would be very difficult for me to forget uh that name even as difficult as it may be. He went and bapt he went to brother Bham said [clears throat] this brother he said wants to be baptized. He said brother Bam said well then baptize him. So brother Green takes him and baptize him. He goes back to brother Bam. He says okay baptize brother God only. He said now go preach for him. Amen. Down in Central America. I forgot where is Guatemala somewhere. down in Central America is Hispanic. Said that now go preach for him. Go do what? &gt;&gt; First man in &gt;&gt; go establish. Yes. &gt;&gt; See that message, that truth. That word that was come uh uh for for a bride for this day. Amen. Was that apostle, the missionary is the first one out. He's the first he's the longest one on your hand. So, he's the first one that goes when you when you go to shake somebody's hand, he's the first one that that's there to meet them. Amen. The next one, the ring finger is the teacher. Amen. The teacher. The teacher is so to where a a teacher can't do anything without already having the uh a ministry established. Right? &gt;&gt; So, if you take away the prophet, you take away the uh the apostle, the missionary, and you take away the evangelist, which is the little pinky, cuz he's the little fiery guy that's over on the end that has he can go and do and be and he he's he's loose and free and uh but but the but the teacher's bound. Amen. He's bound. If you take away these others, I don't know how you can see us very well. You try to do it on your chair. Amen. Maybe little kids, you can try this. Amen. Put your hand down like that. Take away the prophet and the the apostle and the and the uh evangelist and see if you can move your teacher. Can't move him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The teacher can't move if he doesn't already have the others in place. Now if you got if you got the apostle if you got the apostle in place apostles gone in and established the work a teacher can come in because an apostles just as our subject today is on the apostle our apostle is the one he's a foundational preacher he's a foundational uh minister that goes in and lays the foundation usually he'll go in and lay that faith foundation the statue of a perfect man to build on that that apostle is very important to have something established enough so a building that is strong enough in faith in the word that it can be built upon. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And and once the introduction of that happens, see an an apostle doesn't teach, he doesn't necessarily bring forth doctrine. He'll lay the foundation of doctrine, but it takes the others to come in. Amen. Not so much the evangelist, even though the evangelist can have some doctrine. Evangelist doesn't normally give doctrine, but he can. But a a pastor and a and a teacher can bring in some doctrine. So if you've got if you've got the prophet or you've got the teacher there that's the apostle that's already done, you the teacher can move then. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he if he's been established, but if you take them away, you can't have the teacher. You can't have the teacher unless there's already been somebody in there to establish that work and to bring that ministry forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the the evangelist, like we said, is the little fiery guy on the end. I mean, you can take all these guys away and that that evangelist can still move and go whichever way he wants to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. because he's that evangelist that's independent and moves around and can can be and go and do whatever God tells him to do. &gt;&gt; That that is one of the main reasons if not the reason I believe that God told Brother Brandham to do the work of an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Didn't say he was an evangelist but said do the work of an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham wasn't he wasn't adhered to anybody. &gt;&gt; He wasn't stuck to any denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He he didn't have to worry about who was going to fund him or who was going to sponsor him. Now, he had sponsors, of course, he had people that would help him. God God would send people, but you recognize the one time, see, brother Brandham, God told Brother Bam, do the work of an evangelist. But the one time you go read it in uh is it prophet visit South Africa? I forget. It's been a long time since I read um or or or even the supernatural books. Brother Adam went overseas and he was sponsored by these by these brothers. Uh uh I can't even remember which which organization it was that sponsored it, but these brothers sponsored it. And they're like, "Okay, Brother Brown, you're going to go here and you're going to be here and you're going to do this and you're going to preach here and you're going to go to this town and you're going to go to this town." And they're telling them where he's going to go. Amen. But this one time, God said, "Don't go with them. You go over here." &gt;&gt; Right? I want you over here to this other town, to this other church, to this other place. Don't you go over there. Amen. And brother Brandham in himself admittedly compromised compromised the integrity of his evangelistic spirit where he was supposed to go where God sends him. Not where man sends him, where God sends him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go where God sends you. See? And God said, "Go here." And those brothers said, "No, we've already got you set up over here." And he said, 'But God told me to go here, but we need you to go over here. So, Brother Brandham trying to be as as he was. You all know, you listen to his message, you wouldn't think so sometimes, but he was a people pleaser. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not ever want to hurt anybody's feelings, right? &gt;&gt; He always wanted to get along and uh please people and and and just kind of go along. So he went along and went over with these brothers and he disobeyed God. Told him to go over here. He went over here with these brothers and said, "We had this all set up for you." He said nothing. He said there was no God in that place. There was no movement of God. There was nothing that happened. It don't matter if people fall down crying, screaming, yelling or come to the altar, whatever. If God's not there, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Emotional make you do almost anything. Saint &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Emotional bring you to an altar. Emotional make you cry and scream. emotion will make you shout and dance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if the spirit of God's not there, it's just you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And when he disobeyed God and he went to where he wasn't supposed to because he's supposed to be an evangelist. You go and do what I tell you what God said. Amen. And he went do what these brothers told him. We already have you set up over. He went over there and got so sick. He got this amieba or something in him in his system in his stomach. It like to killed him. It almost killed him. He had to go and apologize. And he went to the brothers and apologized. He apologized to God. Amen. And and this amoeba that got in his body from disobeying God almost killed him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Almost took his life. You see, because an evangelist is supposed to go according to where the spirit leads. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where God tells him to go, what God tells him to do. Right. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it seems like nowadays. Uh it's not all together that way. We kind of set up programs and we set up appointments and all this and do these things instead of just saying, "Okay, God told me to come out." And then I no offense to anybody and I love all the brothers that come and preach and the the few that we actually have here but I can't remember the last time somebody's called me on the phone and said you know brother Newton God just told me to come preach for your group. You know how much respect I would have for someone like that. But when it's really true and I would believe that as it has happened that way because it has happened that the Lord would be speaking to me as well &gt;&gt; about this brother. Amen. To have it. Amen. I I've had somebody on my heart that I felt should be coming out. I'm waiting for God to speak to him or at least I'm waiting for him to listen as God's trying to tell him um to come and and and minister to our group. Amen. But that's up to him. That's between him and the Lord. But you see, he should be free to go and do if he needs to go overseas to go overseas. If he needs to go to a hole in the wall in a nobody town of nowhere, Tucson, Arizona, then that's where you go. If you go when there's two people or you go where there's 2,000, you go where God tells you to do. The whole point of a of an of a an evangelist is to be able to be led of God. &gt;&gt; Now, they're all supposed to be led of God. But you understand, he's free. Not like, see, a pastor would be uh would be someone that's here. See that the pastor's the thumb now, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh he's he's the one that solidifies it, brings it all together. So, he talked about the five-fold ministry. If this five-fold ministry comes together the way they're supposed to and the and the pastor comes and seals that together, you got a weapon to beat the devil with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you got something you can fight with. You got something you can beat the devil with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When it when it comes all together, but see that pastor, he's got a place to stay. &gt;&gt; He's got a place a post of duty that that he's responsible to a people he's responsible for. Amen. He can't just He's not that he's not let of gone, but he doesn't just go to this country next week or to this state next week or the Amen. He's got to be where at his post of duty where God has established him to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, a a a teacher, a a p a prophet can go wherever he wants to take thus sayith the Lord. He's led of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that that prophet is is relegated to where what God would do for him, where God would send him, what God wants for him to do. But today, I I want to take a few moments after after our demonstration, which uh you have to bear with me because I may do that again. If there's some people that aren't here that may be here uh in the next week or so with that five-fold ministry, but I I want to talk about day and I don't get started, there's no way I'll ever get done. Uh but I want to talk today about apostle. Look what this u say why we start with apostle. Well, it has in here the scripture and he gave some apostles. That was the first one that was mentioned in the scripture. He's the first one that goes in and brother Brandham said then besides that he's got five ministerial offices. First is apostles. So I felt safe in starting with apostles. And brother Brandham himself said first is apostles or as we said a little earlier or missionaries. The word apostle means one sent. A missionary means one sent. Amen. Not a pastor. A pastor is not one sent although you see a lot of pastors like you would think they were sent to go out to this church that church and the rest country and that country and all over the world. I I don't necessarily agree that if someone if the pastor wants to go check out a work that was established somewhere or if they want to go make sure the finances of that church that went to this uh this their missionary uh offerings went to this specific work and to go check it out if there's nobody else there. I I would imagine once a year or something would be okay. But a pastor to just to go all the time to here to there and be gone twothirds of the half the time away from their church and say I just I don't agree with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But anyway, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Apostle means one cent. Missionary means one cent. Amen. So missionary and apostle that basically makes them missionary and apostles same thing. Amen. They're both one scent who God sent. Amen. Which reminds me of what brother Brandham told Brother Green. Amen. Go preach for him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I don't say that because Brother Green's not here. I told Brother Green this to his face. And Brother Green knew it. And several times actually behind the pull pit he would talk about that, but not very often because people get so confused when it comes to this five-fold ministry. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and everybody wants to people want to uh first of all they want to take and put God in a box and just say oh God okay God it's supposed to be this way and this is supposed to be this way and this supposed to be this way. It's going to be the way God wants it to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he's working with his with his men when he's working with his ministry it's up to God to do what he wants to do to put them where he wants them to establish them where he wants them to be. That's God's choice not our choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It wasn't, no offense, uh, I love you all more than life. Uh, but Tucson wasn't my first choice to come to. It might have been my wife's, but it wasn't mine. Uh, I wouldn't have come here if God hadn't sent me here. &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't have been where I was if God hadn't done what he does and told me what he told me. Amen. I And I don't move off that till he moves me. &gt;&gt; When he moves me, then I move. They go a different way. Amen. People think that people think I started this church because of the vote and what happened in the tabernacle. That's not true. I did not start this church. In fact, when I got up to resign from Tucson Tabernacle, I knew God was just telling me to leave. I had brothers, maybe even brother Dennis, call me and say, "Well, brother, what are you doing?" I but I didn't announce it the when I resigned from the tabernacle. I didn't resign. I didn't tell everybody now I'm starting a church and I'm going to be the pastor and I'm going to be located over here and here and do this. Proeliting is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I didn't want anybody I think whoever called me may have been Dennis. I've had a couple people call said, "Well, are you you know?" I said, "Well, you know, since you're asking personally, this is what I feel the Lord's led me to do." I didn't do it because of what happened over there. But when that happened, what God told me in Florida, I could see had had come to its end. &gt;&gt; I had accomplished and fulfilled what God told me to do. Now, if others if circumstances or opinions of men or something got in the way of the finality of that, that's up to God. That's not that's not up to me. But I didn't leave because of that. I I I I left out of there and I said, "Lord, because I felt my spirit uh that had just had just debilitated and I was like, Lord, well, then what am I supposed to do?" Cuz all that whole time, I knew I had a purpose, right? When I went to when I went to Xolo, when I went to to to the mountains, I knew and I told PEOPLE BEFORE I LEFT THAT I'd be back. I don't know who it was. I don't I think I told John Garboro uh in his living room one time. They they hated to see me and Sonia leaving. And I told him, I said, "Well, we'll be back. This is just temporary." And I knew it was uh I I I knew there was a reason. The Lord, Brother Green, had help at the time. I knew there was a reason. Amen. I'm probably getting into way too deep too deep more than I should, but um but I knew I knew he'd be back. Now, I didn't tell everybody that. I didn't tell the people up there that, but I knew it would only be for a short period of time because God didn't send me here to go up there. He sent me here to be here with Brother Green, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To help him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God stopped the work up there, when God called me and told me to come back down here is is the time that Brother Green started needing someone the most &gt;&gt; and and it was like perfect timing. And then he plugged me right in and away we went, you know. But when that happened, I just felt that de and [clears throat] up to that time I knew the purpose God gave me. I felt renewed and re rever renewed every day. a new fervor. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But when that happened, I felt like it just it just all drained out. That was the end of it. It was over. I walked out of the church that day. And I was walking through the parking lot. I said, "Lord, what do you want me to do now?" Amen. And I I I felt something come over. It's like, you know, go see your mom. And my mom was sick at the time. And I was going back and forth and she had uh a stroke and all and she couldn't take care of herself. And Michael was helping some. And I was I was going to be with her as much as I possibly could. Amen. And when I went back there and I spent some time alone and I spent some time in prayer, uh I felt like the Lord spoke to me and the next thing was when I got back was to start that work. And so when I got back, I went and resigned the church and I started the work over on Cterero, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Which which is what I felt the Lord told me to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had no place to go. I had no church building. I had no people. I had no I had nothing but a word that God told me to do. So So I did and I I didn't know where to go. I didn't have any money. I I had I had nothing to pay for anything. I had no church building or I had nothing. [snorts] And I saw on Craigslist that church that we had in Cortoro that we were sharing with that other church uh that they were looking for somebody to come and fill in uh some empty time and it wanted $250 a week. And I thought I just I folded up said well I there's no way I could do that. I don't I don't hardly have any money period anyway. So, um I there's no way I could do anything like that. But me and my wife were out and I forgot how why we ended up down there. We went to Walmart or something down on Cortoo. We ended up down that way somehow and all of a sudden it came back to my mind and I drove I I didn't remember didn't look it up. I drove right to it is right there is dur is in the middle of the day when nobody's supposed to be there and I walk up I open the door it's wide open I walk in and I look and the pastor standing right there with some other brothers he said can I help you I said well I don't know and then I just started talking to him about I found this and Craig said he said yeah yeah that's it's still it's still available it's still an option and I said well I don't know why I walked in here he said well I do cuz we're not I wasn't even he said I wasn't even supposed to be here. I he told me he said I'm not even supposed to be here. We're not supposed to be here. This all got changed and rearranged so we would be here right now at this time and you walked in at the perfect time. He said you you are you interested? I said yeah but I you know we need a place to worship. I said but uh I there's no way I could afford that. He said what can you afford? I said nothing. And he said, "Well, I tell you what." He said, "How about $100 a week?" And I thought, "If if this is if God's telling me to do this and he can't afford $100 a week for this, then it's not him." So I said, "Okay." And that's where we started. That's how it got started. Amen. Had not had nothing to do with everything else. It's just following the leading of the Lord, right? &gt;&gt; What is God calling you? What is God telling you? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had everything work out just perfect to be to start it to be what God wanted to be and it worked perfectly fine. And it got probably a little too comfortable. So God sent us CO to get us out of there. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God got us out of there. I told you the story about this church. But anyway, when God does it, see, it's God orchestrating it, not man. It's not us. It's what God does. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are here, I believe, because God led you here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. in one way or another, whether by dream or what, whatever, God led you here. Amen. And that's why you're here to be led of God. And that's all that we know. And that's all that we have. That's all we want to do is be led of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When brother Bram talks about this as as in context of the five-fold ministry, uh it it it helps us understand and get a grasp of a lot of people don't. So when brother Grant when brother Green was in the position he was in, I understood the position he was in. I talked to him several times about it. He mentioned behind his pullpit a couple of times about it. Amen. He even said behind his own pullpit he wasn't a pastor or a good pastor or something like that cuz we all knew he the man was an apostle. He was supposed to be one that was sent. And he did that. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL OVER THE WORLD. 13ome countries he went to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He used to talk about how he flown over three or four million miles, whatever it was, and never one time saw the oxygen mass drop in front of him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I mean, and that's back in the uh in the 60s,7s and when air where air uh travel wasn't like it is today and all that because he was one that was sent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And God sent him. And look what he did in establishing all these churches all over the world and the things that have popped up from that. I mean it it I it's probably immeasurable to conceive the works that are going on of this message in the world today that brother Green had a hand in at some point in time in some way or another. It it just in it probably would boggle the mind if you went back and looked and saw how did this get started? How did this church get established? It had to start somewhere. There had to be one scent to go in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there can be one come off of there and start a work over here. There could be one come over there and start a work over here. But it started somewhere, right? &gt;&gt; It had to start at some point. Amen. And that's what brother Green was good at. That's why brother Brandham told him. I don't mean this to be all about brother Green, but that's why brother Brandham told him. He said, "Your birthday was significant because we know what the seven means." And brother Brand Brother Green said he never told him what the seven means. Amen. We know the seven means completion. But he but he said, Brother Brandham didn't tell him. He said, "We know what the seven means." And the one July 1st, the one in your birthday means you'll be good at starting things. I mean, [laughter] what other kind of confirmation do you need? &gt;&gt; Amen. Wrote and he said, "What are you going to get done? Get started before your 33rd birthday." July 1st, 1933. So, it it it just it just rang like a a a bell. Good at starting things, initiating, getting out there. Uh see God a lot of people didn't like brother brother Green's personality I guess uh and and some of maybe the way but brother but God made brother green the way he was to do what he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. And some and it's like I wrote in my book, some of the some of the worst traits that Peter had. Big mouth Peter, I call them in my book, Big Mouth Peter. Some of the worst traits he had when when he was when he was before he became a a a disciple and and then a Christian and then born again before before all that was was a detriment TO HIM TO THE POINT THAT Jesus had to rebuke Peter and say, "Get behind me. Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had gotten SO OUT OF CONTROL WITH HIS MOUTH and talking and always had to have something to say that it was a detriment to him. But those things, but when he became a Christian, God used those things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He became the spokesman of the group. &gt;&gt; Amen. on the day of Pentecost WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT FELL ON THEM, HE WAS THE ONE THAT STOOD OUT THERE AND SAID, "MEN AND BRETHREN, this is not what you think it is." Amen. He's the one that told them. He's the one that said, "You must be baptized. You must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin. Then you can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For that promise is unto you and your children as far off. Whoever God will send, whoever God will lead. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what now that big mouth as God used it. It still got Peter in trouble later as you know in the scripture. Amen. But God made brother Green the way he made him for a purpose. to be the way he was for a reason. Amen. And his entrepreneurial spirit and and that probably is just an offshoot of of being someone who's good at starting stuff. Uh I mean that's basically what an entrepreneur is, isn't he? Someone who starts stuff. Well, that's just a you know, Brother Brandon, I think you even said one time that a lot of a lot of politicians out there have received uh a gift of ministry and they use it in in the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Because we know politics is of the devil. It's of the world. It's all wicked and evil. But there's one side I agree with more, but it's all wicked because this is all it's part of the cosmos. It's part of the go Satan's economy. But anyway, &gt;&gt; some of those people had that gift and they used it in a wrong way. &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother but brother Green had the gifts he had for the reason he had. Amen. Let let me finish this. [clears throat] Missionary, apostle, apostle, one sent. Secondarily, prophets, evangelists, pastors, so forth. These are Godgiven gifts that set in the church. He Amen. gave. These are God-given gifts that are set in the church. They're predestinated of God and set in the church. God predestinates. &gt;&gt; It's not our calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't my wife's favorite thing when God called me in the ministry. wasn't my favorite thing, but it's God's calling. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if what we want to do is to fulfill the purpose of our lives for God in this life, then what we do is be led by his spirit and do what he tells us to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it's not always easy, &gt;&gt; especially like being an apostle. But I believe God prepares a person for each position that they're supposed to take. Like we've said before, your upbringing and your parents and your neighborhood and the pe the place you live and all everything brings it around to to mold that in your life. Amen. These are God-given. They're predestined of God set in the church. You can't make yourself be a uh be a minister. Although I I believe there's a lot of people do. Brother Ram says, "You can't make yourself," let's just say, I don't want to add to this message, but let's just say it this way. You can't make yourself be a minister of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or you can't make yourself a God- called minister. I I That probably explains it a little bit better because there's all kinds of people that minister that aren't supposed to, but that aren't God called. BUT WHEN GOD CALLS, &gt;&gt; AMEN. God calls you to be to fulfill that position, then God is responsible to you. &gt;&gt; God is responsible for you. God is responsible to keep you on the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he says God got to call you to be a minister. Prophets are for ordained. They're prophets. He said, "Now there's a gift of prophecy, which maybe at some point in time we'll get along to the understanding of the difference between a a a a word prophet and a a gifted prophet, a a a man of prophecy, which can also be a woman in that case, a prophetess." Amen. A woman can be a prophet like that. She can't be a word called prophet like uh to carry the word because the Bible forbids that. But she can be a prophet as in giving prophecy to prophesy. Absolutely. [snorts] Amen. Prophets are for ordained. They're prophets. There's a gift of prophecy in the church that could be on one and not on the next one and so forth. But he said, "Now, greater than Solomon is here." Let me finish this for Greater Than Solomon is here. 1961. Now there's nine spiritual gifts that goes on in every local body. We believe that 1 Corinthians 12. Now some people would think that if you hold if you hold brother Brandham in a certain light as well I'll just say if you think he's God things like this will throw you off. That's why a lot of people end up leaving. They believe brother Brandon was infallible. And if they find one little error, one little mistake or something, not on the ministering of the word, but something like this, which I'm getting ready to read, they just leave. Amen. They leave because they placed him in that pos that impossible position of never doing anything wrong. &gt;&gt; But look what he says here. He says, "We believe that first Corinthians 12, but there are five gifts as ordained of God for the church and body gifts." What uh what is the first is apostle. Well, that's not in 1 Corinthians 12. We just read that's in Ephesians 4. The ministry is he was talking about the other gifts of the speaking in tongues and prophecy and things like that. those other gifts. But this when he's talking about this five-fold ministry, the five gifts ordained of God for the church, the body gifts ordained for the church, it's a so it's a so it's a gift. Amen. Uh the five-fold ministry is a gift to the church to the people, &gt;&gt; right? What is the first apostles and that is not really in in our day he talks about missionary again because apostle missionary is very same word missionary means sent one sent &gt;&gt; apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists five gifts now man cannot be an apostle because just because he wants TO BE GOD SETS those in the church &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he cannot be just because he wants to he cannot be a pastor just cuz he wants to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I know. Well, this is this is out where anybody can see it, but I won't call names, but you can use if if you have enough of God, you can usually tell if you've heard a person minister enough, you can tell. You can usually tell, especially if they're like an evangelist or a pastor or a teacher or a pastor or an evangelist. Amen. Normally, you can tell because if if there's a ministry there, it's going to orchestrate itself through their life and you'll be able to see it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You'll be able to recognize because the the the characteristics are undeniable. The characteristics of an evangelist are are so far different. Now, for a pastor and a teacher, the characteristics can be fairly similar. Amen. But you'll see that teacher doing a lot more in the in the vein of teaching really rather than pastoring to people. Amen. Being a pastor to people like a shepherd would to his flock. Amen. Which uh a lot of times see a teach a teacher is not gifted to do that. Amen. evangelists. You can see a lot of times evangelists how their ministry goes and all. I I know a couple in town right now that are pastoring churches that are evangelist. I'll just say it. Uh I know uh back in North Carolina, there was a a pastor that lost his church. He had quite a large church. Uh lost his church and started going to a different church. Um, and because that church voted him out and they voted in a person who was an evangelist and eventually that church dwindled down to where there was hardly anybody there and basically I don't even think it's open today. &gt;&gt; That evangelist and he was like 2 250 people. That evangelist basically destroyed that church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because evangelist is not gifted, especially over a period of time like that is not gifted to be able to pastor a church to pastor people. He's not gifted. That's not his position. Amen. Eventually, again, like I said, that if that church is still open, there's probably two people in it. It just the church just whittleled down. It was is nothing anymore. Amen. And then, of course, there was a time there where there started to be let in ministry that was contrary to the message, that was contrary to the scripture, and things that were uh from things that I've heard. Now, I'll just say this as hearsay. Not that I heard it was just really filthy. It just not disgusting things to try to say about the word. Uh and then all that just just destroyed it. Just destroyed it. See? So, it's got to be in it. It's got to be in its place. See, no man see brother said, "Now, a man cannot be an apostle just because he wants to be." &gt;&gt; Right? And again, I'll add, he can't be a pastor just because he wants to be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He can't be an evangelist just because he wants to be. He can't be a prophet just because he wants to be. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You've got to be. You have to be. God sets those in the church. And he cannot be a prophet just because he wants to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be God called, God ordained. It's God called and God ordained, God backs it up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that it has to be. Not a lot of people get the misnomer that because there's hundreds of people there, it's successful. That that doesn't mean anything at all. If that's true, then if you need to go check out Joel Ostein's church where he fills up a whole basketball arena three times on Sunday and all he talks about is how beautiful the grass is and how blue the sky is. &gt;&gt; There's nothing scriptural about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I listen to him. It's just it's just hyperbole. It's just something to try to He must have some kind of psychology degree or something to just try to make you feel good. &gt;&gt; When you go out of there and and and of course want to make you open your wallet to him, too. But that's uh that's another story. But you can't you can't go by that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said, "I'd rather be preaching the word and sit on the corner with drinking branch water and eating soda crackers and have the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and have thousands of people. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So people get those eyes on that doesn't mean success at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't mean success at all. What means success is do you see God in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see God moving in your life? &gt;&gt; Do you see God moving in your church? Do you see God moving in in in in the church services? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is God present? Do you feel it? Do you know he's there? Amen. When when you know that's true and you can look at the word and say, you know, &gt;&gt; that message is right on the word. My pastor is right on that message and then you know that God God is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what makes all the difference in the world. When God is with you, God, an apostle missionary is one who is sent. One who is sent. Look what uh Paul said here. &gt;&gt; Galatians 1:1. If you want to turn, very simple, easy scripture we know of that Paul [clears throat] says several times. I just picked this one. But look what he said here now on the vein that we just read. Paul an apostle calling himself Paul an apostle. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But look what he said now. He said, [clears throat] "Not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead." Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul is an apostle. He's declaring to the Galatian church. Paul's an apostle, BUT HE'S NOT APOSTLE OF MAN. He's not a man. He's not an apostle that was sent by man. He was He's an apostle that was sent by Jesus Christ. I'm here because of him, not because I want to be. Amen. And you look at the things an apostle has to go through. You look at a thing that that the apostle apostle more than anybody probably an apostle spends time away from home, away from his wife, away from his children. An apostle, excuse me, apostle spend more time usually out of his home than any other because he'll go for a month or so at a time in another country or something like that. May be gone for months at a time cuz he's supposed to be &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He's supposed to be gone. He's supposed to be out there, not not at home. just sitting and uh whatever it is, he's supposed to be out there. He's supposed to be gone. Now, I will say that the necess the necessity of an apostle today has lessened somewhat. Um I I want to I'm it's getting so late on me. I'm sorry. Um but there's so much of this. It just ties in together. I'll close here shortly. I can't see the clock without my glasses. Anyway, uh Revelation 3, you look in Revelation 3 and you see the church ages. Uh well, you see it in Revelation 2 and three, but in three, the about the seventh verse, it gets us to uh the Philadelphia church age. And when we get to the Philadelphia church age, this is what Jesus said. unto the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write these things saith uh saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutth and shutth and no man openeth. Now look what he says in the eth verse, Revelation 3:8. I know thy works, and have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it. Now, what was that open door in the Philadelphia church age? The [snorts] Philadelphia church age opened a door. And this door, Brother Vanom describes to us, this door was the opening of the missionary age. &gt;&gt; The this open door was the opening of an apostle age of a missionary age where people were to go. Now remember this country wasn't established until n well there was people here in the 1600s as far as Englishmen as Native Americans here I I don't know if they know how far back the Native American goes but they've been here when when the English man got here 1600 first Thanksgiving we have was 1621 so uh but wasn't established in se until 1776. &gt;&gt; Amen. in 1776 declaring our independence from England uh we became a nation &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but before that time you recognize and see the Philadelphia church age and the time frame that it falls in was that time where this country started uh developing and started getting into its independence into its uh uh its own nation and so missionaries were coming over here they were going all over is that open door that sent them all over the One reason that made John Wesley, in my opinion, one reason that made John Wesley the messenger for that age. &gt;&gt; John Wesley was one that was made the messenger for that age because him and his brother just tore this United States up, going up one side and down the other. Now, not on the west coast, but on the east coast going up and down. And of course, the mode of transportation then was by horse, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There was no car, there was no jets, there was no plane. It's not like they could fly and preach a sermon and leave town. When they went, they set up camp and they went as missionaries as work. And I believe because John Wesley was in that vein of being a missionary, that was he was because he was so he was called to be that messenger for that age, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For that Philadelphia church age, it was told. Now, I'll read you some of the statistics I found. The Philadelphia as we said the Philadelphia church age u was from 1750 to 1906 as brother Brandham has it when our church age book. Amen. So as I said just now I forgot I had written this written this down but it started in 1750. Well, this country was birthed as we say in 1776. But these men like John Wesley, Charles Wesley during the during the enlightenment and the reformation, you had uh brothers like John and Wes uh John and Charles, his brother Wesley, George Whitfield, Charles Spurgeon, Dwight Moody. All these were come along as missionaries, as apostles to spread that gospel, to be ones, the first ones to go into an area and to start ministering the gospel and for a church to be established and for there to be growth in there of the gospel for people to learn the gospel. It was said, as I look some statistics up, John uh John Wesley uh John and Charles Wesley, it was said John Wesley wrote a quarter of a million miles and preached 400 or 40,000 sermons. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He rode on a horseback a quarter of a million miles. I thought, brother Green, flying three, four million was a lot. You get on the back of a horse and ride 250,000 miles and come talk to me about it. See how you feel. I'm not riding with you, that's for sure. I've ridden a horse. I like riding a horse. Mile or two maybe, but after that I'm done. 250,000 miles. Now, of course, that was their mode of transportation then, so they were more used to it. But 250,000 miles. Now, he lived from 1703 to 1791. So during that period of time when he got to the age that he was called to this till uh he was not able to do it anymore. So uh you look at 80 uh 88 years minus whatever time you got there 40,000 sermons. 40 thou you know I did the math on that some one time and I forgot where I put it. Amen. 40 It's like uh I think I if I remember right it was like seven sermons a week on average. If you averaged it out over 50 years or something, the active years a person would minister, it was like seven message, seven uh uh ministry, seven messages a week for 50 years on average. &gt;&gt; No, that's that open door, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's that Philadelphia church age. That was that missionary time where they went out and they went to establish. Now, it it may have been he may have rode into the middle of nobody town with six people and started preaching. He didn't have he didn't necessarily have churches like this to come into and say, "Hey, you know, brother, I feel led of the Lord." No, he just rode on his word. The Lord led him sent him to a place he'd set up camp, start preaching, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody invited him in their church or in their home or something. Maybe they didn't. But 40,000 sermons in his lifetime, that's a lot. Quarter of a million miles he wrote. But that was that Philadelphia church age. [snorts] Amen. That age of of the missionary age that we know is called the missionary age. Amen. Had to be someone, as we said, apostle has to be someone that is good at starting things. Yes. I got that from brother Green because it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He told me that and then he got up behind the pull pit and said that about himself. Put two and two together. I don't know. People criticized me for it, but it's the truth anyway. Amen. I feel freer to say it now. He's gone. And me and but me and brother Green had these conversations in private just the two of us several times about that. And anyway, uh apostles, as we said, are foundational preachers. Uh they'll they'll the the apostle comes in to set up. They come in and preach a a a simple message, maybe a message of baptism and a message of uh of of giving and a message of uh sal just a salvation messages and things to set up that foundation of faith. See, because a real apostle will set that foundation again, like I said, where a building can be built upon it. He's not there to build the building. He's there to lay the foundation, &gt;&gt; right? So that God sends other ministers in to be able to evangelists and pastors and teachers to to bring that to build that church up to where it grows in grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the whole point. But he's there. That's the one that's the foundation to get it all started. They introduce doctrine, but they don't teach doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. They'll they'll a a godly called man, a minister will will introduce baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. He won't necessarily baptize anybody because somebody will come in behind him and do that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The pastor or something, they'll do that. &gt;&gt; But he'll set that foundation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Of of a foundational be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. will set that foundation, that foundation of faith, and others will come in and build on that. Amen. Missionaries have to go through a lot. Missionaries, uh, I think I got a quote in here one time, brother said here that I want to say that the greatest calling there is on earth in my opinion is the mission fields. &gt;&gt; He says that, amen, one who is sent. Now again, I as we are gleaning in this age, I believe that has waned a bit. I I don't necessarily believe that's uh to the degree that it used to be. Uh I still think there's an importance there. But there has been so much of this gospel and so much of this message all over the world now. There's churches uh I forgot how many millions of people now according to the voice of God recordings that claim that this is that they believe the message. They they live the message that that is their u u uh that's their spiritual enlightenment is the message around the world. The church is all over the world now. So, an apostle to go in somewhere and set up something is usually not is really not normally viable too much today because you get you again you you get a church and you set a church up in a place in India and and that church gets established and ministers get raised up in there. Then this minister will get to the place to where he goes off. Amen. and he starts a work over here. And another minister will come and he he starts a work over here. And someone out of this church will raise men up in this church and he'll come and start a work over here. And see all those all those churches start getting established all all over the place as a result of that one satellite church, right? &gt;&gt; That one place that was there that set it up. &gt;&gt; At at one time there was one message church in this city, Tucson Tabernacle. How many are there now? 15, &gt;&gt; something like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; probably twice as many as there should be, but something like that. I think I counted one time. There's several. &gt;&gt; Uh, now just in Tucson, Arizona. How many was there in 1965? One. &gt;&gt; So, you see each one come out. I was with my pastor uh in North Carolina for 10 years. I sat in his ministry for 10 years. Uh uh what long after I started the Lord put me in the ministry. I ministered there for about six years and after about six years the Lord spoke to me because I got real diligent about Lord what is the calling you put in my life? What are you what part of the ministry do you want me to fulfill? And I felt the Lord spoke to me and told me he wanted me to be a pastor. So I went to my pastor and I told him I said uh I I I'd like to be used here more because I believe God's called me to be a pastor. that's a part of the ministry I believe the Lord's put me in and I'm not going to be actively seeking to go out evangelize or do any missionary work because that's not my calling. I told him that. I said, "I'll stay. I'll be at home most time now. If somebody calls me, I feel led to go, I'll go, but this is my call." And he said, "Okay, that sounds sounds fine to me." About four years later, the Lord gave me a church, &gt;&gt; opened the doors, and I started pastoring, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's just the way God does things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It it's it it's just the way God works. Now, let me finish. But see, I let me finish this thought. I'll close. But missionaries endure a lot. Amen. First of all, there's a lot of uncertainty in some cases if you're a true missionary, especially in the day where you're going into the jungles of places where there's no churches and no establishment of the message or anything. But brother Ram says, "Now in Africa, he said, in Africa, I would eat when they just," he said, and then he said, "I don't see how in the world I could have done it." &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, what he's talking about is he had to eat things that he wouldn't normally eat. He had to eat things that probably uh was not very pleasing to eat. &gt;&gt; U and you know the uh food the diet that some uh some country staple diet is bugs. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the only bug I ever read is if it accidentally flies in my mouth. And it's not chocolate covered or anything either. It's just straight in. So, but there the staple of some of them. So, you you've got to be in the position. I mean, Brother Null's come in here and told us about some of the things that they've had to eat. And &gt;&gt; uh I I I I've had other brothers I've talked to that when they went to a missionary place, boy, I'm getting late. uh they've gone to a place he said they've had they've had to scrape the maggots off just to slice a piece off for them to eat but you eat it. That's what brother Brown said. He said I don't see how in the world I could have ate it. He said God just had to help me. That is all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've had him I I've had him tell me uh I think maybe this is brother cross said that they went and this is India built they had to go boil it. They they take water out of the stream. It just looks like good water. Just take it out of string, set it on a fire, and boil it. And after it boils about five minutes, the whole thing turns white cuz all them meebas and the maggots and stuff that that the heat killed. And they all died bloated and floated to the top. They had to scrape all that off and all just to try to have some decent water. He said, "And then it wasn't safe. Not for people who aren't used to it." &gt;&gt; But then they could drink it. See, they give usually if you go over there now, they give you bottle water or something you can drink because our system can't take something like that. But those people, he said he would see them drink that after they skimmed all the maggots and stuff off of it, all the amoeba, they skim all that off. They would drink that water. They were used to it. Their system, their body, they could take it. See, but if you're a missionary and go do you, you can't just go over there for a month and say, "No thank you. No thank you. No thank you." You've got to eat. You've got to eventually at some point in time eat. Now, I think I've heard it's gotten a little bit better when you're in more of an established city where you could have more food like we're used to eating. But if you go out in places where they just live off the land and stuff, you just you just eat with them. You you eat where they eat, you sleep where they sleep. Remember why brother Brandham, brother Green told us that uh in India they didn't give you the they didn't shake I think it was India, they didn't shake your right hand or Burma, something like that. You know in this country you go and for fellowship you go shake somebody's right hand they shake your right hand they don't do that over there I don't I don't remember if it was India Burma somewhere they don't shake you if you go in and shake your right hand they won't shake your right hand they'll put their left hand out say well the Bible says right hand of fellowship and now don't be approved about it because listen those people just go and squat over a hole and they wipe themselves with their right hand now do you want to shake their right hand you know Maybe the right hand of fellowship's not so good right now. I think I'll take the left. That's what they do. They would squat over hold and they would clean themselves with their right hand. &gt;&gt; That's why they don't shake with their right hand. &gt;&gt; Being a missionary, a lot of people think, but if you're a missionary, it's it's your calling. It's in your blood. It's what you want to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I imagine you can't hardly see a plane fly over your head without wishing that you were going to someplace to help people or to be there for them. He said, "God just helped me." That was all. But if you have to do it anyhow, you see, and so people who missionary, he said, go through a lot of unpleasant things. And that's true. &gt;&gt; But the good part of it is, as I close here, good part of it is if you're God called, God blesses you in that. &gt;&gt; You don't seek that out. You don't want to do that. If if you're if if you call yourself a missionary and you fly into the main city and you stay at the Hilton and uh that that's that's not a missionary. A missionary gets out and goes into the jungles and and lives where the people live and eat where the people eat and minister to them in their primitive whatever. No matter how hot it is or how cold it is or if it's raining or it doesn't matter, but God ordains you to do that. God anoints you to do that. God blesses you to do that. And when he's there, it just it makes everything. It's like the dark ages. People would talk about how horrible the dark ages were, and they were absolutely horrendous that humans could do those things to another to other humans. But those people had an anointing. They were anointed to do that. &gt;&gt; Yes. I &gt;&gt; I personally believe when they lit that fire to burn them at the stake, they didn't feel a thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe the smell of smoke or something. I don't But God was there. &gt;&gt; God was with them. Amen. And when God takes care of it, he can take just like he did Shadrach, Meshack, and Abedneo, he can take the fire out of the fiery furnace. &gt;&gt; He can take the heat out of the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can come forth out of that furnace without even a smell of smoke on you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because God's with you. &gt;&gt; That's why the witness was, I see a fourth man walking around looks like the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when God's with you. It sounds disgusting to us. Amen. But they live that way. And that's the way and and they have to be built for that. They are built for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I'm gonna I thought I would just extend this, but I'm going to close it. Uh we've we've gotten the apostle, but I do want to read one more scripture before I close. 2 Corinthians 11:13 just kind of solidify what we have been talking here. For such are false prophets, deceitful [clears throat] workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ, transforming themselves. Amen. To make a scheme out of it, to make them look like something they're not. See, [snorts] and no marvel base, don't don't let this surprise you. For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. as a lightbearer. He was transformed himself into an angel of light. Therefore, it is no great thing that his ministers. Now, what his is this? This is not a god his. This is a devil. His &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Amen. His ministers, Satan's ministers, there's no great thing that Satan's ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works. &gt;&gt; Amen. according to their works. So we know where they end up &gt;&gt; because the word tells us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The devil, false prophet, beast, all its followers end up cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's no wonder that Satan who himself transform into a angel of light would have his minister, Satan's ministers. Amen. Trying to preach the word, not God, not called, not of God, not ordained of God, but try to preach, what do they do? It's a detriment to people. It's harmful to people. It hurts them. Now, but remember now, the good part about that is the bride cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride, she cannot be deceived.

And I I I appreciated and respected that so very much. Amen. Because God's the one that did it and I trust the Lord. The Lord takes care of it. Even if it doesn't make any sense or even if it doesn't fit with what you think, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. God's the one that's in charge of it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Trying to find this. [snorts] Amen.

So amen. Lord bless you. Amen. Good to see each one of you. Does anyone have anything before dismiss today? &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. Appreciate each one of you coming to be here with us today. Let's just bow our heads as we pray a word of prayer for you. Brother, would you dismiss us? &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I feel like what David said one time, I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. Lord, your word has come forth. It was a spiritual food in due season. May you truly uh apply it to our hearts. And it's like our pastor just said, &gt;&gt; everyone will be preaching your gospel by living your gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what even Paul and brother Brown said. The greatest sermon ever preached was a live sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes. There's people that'll never pick up a Bible and the prophet taught us that the only Bible they'll ever see is the the walking Bible, your life presented before them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to live that life continually. We know there's a allseeing eye watching us. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we go from this house of worship, Lord, may we truly throughout the week live that life. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Be ready. Be prayed up. Have that burden for the lost. Father, I heard you prophesy one time that there was a man that left the church. He got away. And other people in the church says, "Brother Ram, you're wasting your time. Don't go after him. He's a renegade. He's a troublemaker. And the prophet says, "As long there's breath in that body." &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He has a soul that's worth more to God than 10 million worlds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he went after him. He brought him back to the fold. You used him to bring him back &gt;&gt; to you, Father. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And may we have that burden. Maybe there's someone that you put in our hearts that we need to go out and reach and and share your gospel while there's time. Oh, Father, bless each and everyone that came this morning. &gt;&gt; May there may they be like the as they walk with you on the road of Emmas. May our hearts truly burn within us as we meet with you along the way, not only in church, but all through the week. Father bless them. Grant everyone traveling mercies to their destinations. Father in your name we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you today. Amen.
