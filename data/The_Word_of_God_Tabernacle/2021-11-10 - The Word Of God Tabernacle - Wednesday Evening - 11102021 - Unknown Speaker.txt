going to begin reading with the first verse tonight amen if you could send your feet please we approach approach the author of the word right amen and ask once again to meet with us tonight amen lord jesus we're so very thankful father that we have felt your presence so far lord as our brother said tonight god is to talk about you just to sing about you brings you on the scene lord with a willing

there with wings covering their feet their face and in humility and flying lord crying holy holy holy lord god almighty they're there doing that before the throne of god tonight but lord when we cry and call upon the name of jesus your children tonight prevails beyond even that we thank you god that your ear is open to the crowd the righteous that you hear us lord lord we thank you god for the

so appreciative lord thank you god for giving me health thank you god for speaking to me lord and pray god that once again you would have preeminence in this service tonight lord not just through the speaker to speak what you have to be said that you will listen through the hearer to hear god and reveal to every heart what you'd have for us to see and know tonight lord we thank you god for all that you've done for us and for this service and lord for whatever time you give us left upon this earth to live for you we give you glory praise and honor now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen revelation chapter 2. we're going to begin reading there now with verse 1 chapter 2 verse 1 and unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things sayeth he that hold the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars since then for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left by first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast that thou hate us the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god you could be seated now i'm i i felt um to take a subject tonight that i had taken at brother rogers when i was down there a few weeks ago and i titled it to conquer nicolaitanism to conquer nicolaitanism now i i realized that i the the irony of the title is not lost on me some because of the irony of the conquering nicolaitanism which in the word nicolaitan is the word nico which is to conquer so it seems a little backward but really when you dig into it it really isn't it's exactly what uh the true bride of christ is out to do exactly what the the the bride through his church age was called to do and of course the prophet of this last day was called to do was to crush and conquer nicolaitanism uh there are uh there's a few things in the bible that that god says he hates there's not many handful of things that god in the scripture that god says he hates nucleationism is the only thing i have found scripturally that god said twice he hates because he says that in verse 6 and then he says it again in verse 15. amen two times god said he hates nicolaitanism so if if god said that he hates nicolaitanism or or the nicole action or the deeds of the nicholas and you know i think it uh it deserves a little examination to maybe find out why that that god hated nicoleton so much that twice even this entire bible you can count on one hand how many times god said he hates something that twice he said he hates nicolaitanism amen twice so so it behooves us to look and see why is it ism that god hates the most now we understand that that the word nicolaitan is to conquer the laity we understand that uh and and and that's not something that that i bring to you that you didn't know or this new to you probably i'm sure you uh knew that heard that and uh but the underlying causes in the underlying results of what nicolaitan represents i believe is what god hates the most because if you look here and you see at the church age so we'll just go through the church ages just a little bit just the first few here because uh that's where it begins in the ephesian church ace the ephesians was birthed forth as the perfect church it was the church that was born in the upper room where the 120 received the holy spirit all at one time they went out preaching the gospel and souls were added to the kingdom daily and three thousand that very day was added because of the ministry of peter so there's three thousand of them and of course the results of the others having the holy spirit there was uh it was that perfect church it was birthed forth it wrote a book of acts as it went along and and different souls were saved and people were healed and miracles were performed and we know what's in the book of acts so as ephesians was birthed forth as that perfect church is that church that of that member received the holy ghost all at one time went forth from that point and as it goes forth from that point remember as they go forth from that point each one of them wander out into satan's eden so of course at this world being satan's ears of jesus christ and that's the experience that brother branham exhorted us to have amen over and over again but the same thing exists today and people take advantage of that if they're not a god-called person they're absolutely one of the first things they're going to do is try to get people under them and by under i literally mean under not physically but spiritually under them where they can basically dictate and lord over and tell that person or people what to do and then those people fall into that because it's a you agree with me but it's nicolasism is an easy religion it's very easy because there's no responsibility attached to it there's no responsibility to the individual you ask them well you know about so-and-so i know what my pastor preaches well have you read this for one of my pastors read that for me well that's the same thing they said the catholic church was born oh we just do what the priest said of course then they didn't have the bible that they could read in their own language they didn't have a bible they could read they had no way to know what it said all they could do is rely upon their priest or their pope that's all they had but we have no excuse today friend we have the bible we have the message we have what has been sent to us to give to us for us to know that the leadership of the holy spirit is an individual basis for you as well as it is for me not you for me or me for you no it's for me and then it is for you amen not for my relationship i've said many times my relationship with jesus christ is just that my relationship with jesus and your relationship with him should not be between you brother branham and my relationship isn't between me my wife and god right see it that's it praise the lord and yours should be the same yours shouldn't be between me god and you amen no it's between you and him now god puts leadership in positions and places and churches things like that but leadership is not conquering a true leader will not conquer the people right he will simply lead right amen as one of them right that's all he does he leads as one of them doesn't conquer doesn't become above them doesn't become more important to them than them doesn't become and and i see it so many times uh my there's so many things i want to say but they get so personal i just i probably shouldn't say them but i've witnessed it so many times i've seen it and the tactics of it they're so sly and cunning just just like they came in jesus said you left your first love then that nicholas slid in there because they left their first love uh they they they entered into the next church age was wasmernia they went from ephesus to smyrna and brother branham said smyrnia was anointed for death and we're only talking about the second church age we're only talking about 300 plus years after the death of christ after the day of pentecost basically give take a few days weeks whatever it is they were already anointed for death now we know that the root word of smyrnia is myrrh which is bitter uh which is and myrrh is something that was used as an embalming fluid to embalm the dead that's why they that one of the wise men the magi brought jesus murder it was an anointment of his death it was a representation of his death and that anointment that was that anointing or that an uh ointment that was there the myrrh was to represent his the bitterness of his death right because burr is bitter or uh myrrh is bitter and that smirnia had entered into a place of bitterness why because they left their first love look friend when when love has left you all you've got is bitter i don't care if you're a nominal bitter you're just uh uh angry uh resentful mean ugly bitter you're just just a bitter person people just become better that's why brother brandon said i don't want my life to be crowned with bitterness yeah because that's the way when you go through life and that love kind of fades away all when the love's gone there's nothing left of bitterness well the first church ephesus left their first love so what were they looking at a church full of bitterness church full of bitterness now that bitterness just made way for the third church age pergamus to come in and when pergamos come in the the nicolaitans let's go to the 15th verse such as jesus 2. god said in the 14th verse i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam which did the same thing amen did the exact same thing who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children israel to eating sacrificed the idols to commit fornication he basically came out he couldn't curse him so he just said hey we're just all one why don't y'all just marry in why don't y'all just join in together with the moabitess and and all this heathenism and uh all this infidelity sure that's okay oh yeah we all belong together we're all one uh moab is simply lot who was uh abraham's nephew tended him to stay that way just like satan tries to do the exact same thing today because in conquering and trying to conquer the laity he tries to cause you to lose your identity you are if if he can lord over you conquer over you see the difference is jesus is our lord amen he lords over us because he's our lord but jesus does everything he can to get us to the place that we recognize who we are right in him that's right but satan does everything he can through the spirit of nicolaitanism to strip identity and who we really are and friend you can't have the right kind of faith that you need to have to walk through this daily life unless you know who you are if you don't realize who you are and where you are in christ you are no match for the devil right because it strips your faith yes how can you have faith how can you have faith in something with no foundation how can you have a foundation if you don't even know where you stand if you don't even know who you are you know one of the greatest one of the greatest of thefts of today one of the greatest thefts that go on in this world this country especially today identity theft stealing your identity that's just i'm talking naturally in the natural one of the greatest thefts that that thieves do i've said this many times uh stealing outside of the little petty stuff that you see in going and taking a thousand dollars of stuff out of the walgreens uh theft has become a white-collar crime yeah more than a blue-collar crime used to be theft was you walked in with a mask and a gun and you demanded money or something right going to a bank now they just punch a few buttons right hack a computer here or there or something and they try to take that money out of this system over here and put it into their system in cayman islands over here no guns no masks right that's the same thing the devil does the exact same thing today how do they steal your identity they don't come and rob your social security number from you and all your credit cards your all this and they
