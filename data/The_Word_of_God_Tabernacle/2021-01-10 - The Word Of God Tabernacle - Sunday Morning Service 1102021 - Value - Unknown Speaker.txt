TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello everyone god bless you today i hope uh this is coming through okay i've had a few little difficulties here getting it started back from remembering how to do this from last time and signing on to youtube and everything we have to do to try to get this rolling so it feels kind of weird again because it's been a while since i've done this and uh sorry that we have to be under these circumstances but i'm very thankful the lord gives us the opportunity to be able to do this and under these circumstances felt it would probably be best this way so i just pray it just be a blessing to you and help you today i really didn't feel led when i woke up this morning and as tabitha gave me the news about joel that i really didn't feel led to do what i had give god given on my heart uh over this streaming uh so lord willing will do that next week but uh then they're pretty directly you give me something i thought of yesterday and uh and put a couple scriptures together and the things that the lord just put together so and it and it leads right into next week so lord willing this uh this should work out uh hopefully by the will of the lord um this will work out okay i'm not sure if it's gonna stream right or not um it's just saying it's not receiving enough video um we're just gonna try and see what happens so i'm not sure what else to do but we'll go to the lord in prayer now uh there's obviously prayer requests i haven't gotten any this morning with all the chaos and things that's been going on and the uncertainty of what was happening but i'm sure all of us have needs we all have situations in our lives and prayer requests that we have on our hearts uh obviously appreciate your prayers for our family all of us are doing just fine uh i can imagine joel's reaction when he was told he was positive what i didn't i feel fine so uh he probably as surprised as the rest of us uh thought it was just a formality and i honestly uh honestly in my heart of hearts i still honestly believe that this was a false positive we've already heard of so many times where people have false positives and i think i even mentioned church one time the tesla owner elon musk went had a few little cold symptoms and went and got tested four times in one day two tests came back positive two tests came back negative uh so in this world there's only one certainty and that's jesus christ that's god in his word that is the only uncertainty it seems strange too because yesterday uh when i was uh finishing up what the lord had put on my heart for today uh being a in a live service that many of the two or three of the scriptures i went to and i think maybe even the quote i pulled up is from uncertain sound oh it seemed kind of appropriate uh from the messages that i went through yesterday and uh what's happening today everything is just so uncertain but i truly believe we're all well we're all fine sonja's sitting right there she's doing fine i'm doing fine and i thought well if i can figure this out and get this right the lord put something on my heart to give for you today it will take a few minutes in this streaming so again appreciate your prayers for joel and their families act tabitha you know enough of course us uh they can't for the life of them figure maybe where they got it because tabitha joel and emma stay home almost all the time uh they go out once in a while but they went out friday to get tested when they got tested over here close to us they came over and spent the day with sonia and i came home from work and uh spent the rest of the day with them so we were together and uh we're fine i don't i really truly in my heart of hearts don't believe that there's any coven but anyway uh again just to be safe precautious and appreciate your indulgence and your prayers um also very dear friend of mine uh this past week um his little their little boy uh went out in the snow to play uh with his mother and i remember holding his mother in my arms right after she was born and uh anyway she uh she has her own child now and they went out in the snow to play at snowdon north carolina for a little bit and they went outside to play in the snow and they came back in taking his boots off somehow he got away slip fell landed wrong and broke his leg uh i he's a little over a year i think i don't think he's a year and a half yet but he's very young but we sure appreciate your prayers his name is austin their last name is smith so you could remember them in prayer i know they would appreciate it he had to go through fortunately by the grace of god he didn't have to have surgery but they do have a cast on him from his waist down and a little fellow's really active so just please pray for them if you would it just just god would touch it heal it and it would be healed perfectly and quickly so i appreciate your prayer for that again all of us i know we have prayer requests so we're just going to pray together if you pray with me we're going to pray together and we'll just get into this thought the lord give us here so let's bow our heads father god we thank you jesus for all that you do for us we thank you for the protection that you give lord we thank you for your holy angels that are encamped around about us lord every day everywhere we go everything that we do father and you're always with us you never leave or forsake us and god it can't be overstated how much we appreciate that how much that means to me i know and i know it does to rest of us lord with the promise of your word that you are always there with us god we can go in life and we can do things and we can live our lives and we can believe and know that you're there god and lord i pray that you'd move upon our congregation today bless them exceedingly it's a very strange time again and uh we have to be in these circumstances but we're so thankful to you to give us this opportunity once again lord just to speak something from your word just to open the pages of this bible one more time is a greater privilege than we could ever explain but lord may you just speak to us from this word speak to us from as we open the pages of this book lord and lord just show us in here what you'd have us to see and know god teach us something help us to find a truth in it lord help us to find your word god and it relevant in our lives god may you just help us help me now god speak through these lips where she'd have us to hear father uh you know i just have a couple of scriptures things you give me here this morning father i believe revel it uh relevant to uh even next week's service so god may you just speak now we just committed to you and asked your blessings on it bless the people lord bless the prayer requests we're trusting lord believing in joel and his family and us lord we're just we're all negative god with that covet but because you protected and keep us but lord we're thankful god that you give us this opportunity help little austin now god that your hand will be on him continue to bring perfect healing and strength to his little body bless and comfort and help the family to grant faith to them strength now god lord help every request every need that's upon the hearts of your people here today we give you thanks and praise for all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you we'll probably not be very long today uh but again just a couple of thoughts that uh i thought the lord gave me i want to talk about the just the simple thought of the word value uh value it it came to my mind my heart yesterday and um it it's quite a thought to think with everything that's going on today and as i said i'm not going to spoil it but it's a it'll be a good segue into next week's sermon too but the the word value came to me and and what do people value today what what do people put value on what is valuable to people today you know we have wholesale values we have values that are important to the population in general but once you boil it down to individuals those individuals have their own personal values that they put on things and it seems like to me that the devaluation of the human the devaluation of the human soul and the devaluation of the importance of having jesus christ is has gotten to quite a a place in a country that we call a christian nation um we still call it that i guess we do i'm not sure that that's actually accurate anymore but um we live in it and we still have the religious freedoms that many countries don't have and i'm very thankful to the lord for that but the value that's put on things and the devaluation of things but um with that thought in mind let's read our first scripture here it's matthew chapter 10 and you've read it many times but again it's just a simple thought i guess uh in this little minutes a few minutes that the lord gives to put together and uh just trust it be a help and a blessing to you today but let's begin with matthew 10 verse 26 matthew 10 verse 26 jesus says fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed now if that's not a prominent scripture of the day i don't know what and hid that shall not be known what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what you hear in the ear that preachy upon the housetops and fear not them which can kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell now that puts a great perspective on a lot of the fear that goes on today a lot of the fear that people are under today a lot of the fear that we're finding from last week's sermon from the government and from the media from the medical world and from the scientific world and from all those things i didn't mean to devalue medicine i didn't mean to devalue the doctor but we'll talk about that maybe the lord would next week i got home i'll just be honest i got home last week thinking that uh i'd covered revelation 13 uh appropriately or thoroughly and apparently i did because the lord began to speak to me about some other things so but again i didn't want to do that over the stream here today so lord willing we'll do that next week but the value but i thought this was quite outstanding especially when it spoke about the fear it spoke about the things that are being hid today the things that are under cover uh that's going to be revealed it's going to be made known amen this country the way it's going is only going to be revealed however at a time when it's not relevant because this country this world is going to an apostasy it's going into armageddon so it's not going to be relevant once those things come to light they will not be relevant anymore of course during the tribulation and armageddon the bride's going to be gone we're not going to care so now we know that when will they be made light those things that'll be relevant when they're made light is when they're relevant at the judgment seat at the white throne judgment that's when they'll be relevant in all darkness all hidden things will come out and be made known those things are not under the blood amen things that are on the blood will never be remembered by god anymore period but those that are not and the shyster and the sinister things that go on in the world today they will be they will be made known and what he's saying here is don't fear that don't fear that don't fear those that can even kill you or put your body in a grave but fear him now notice he says here he says what i um hear them not fear them not therefore amen which can kill the body fear them feel not fear not them that are able to kill a body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him i notice he said first he said don't fear them but he said fear him well it goes from them to him well who are them those are those around you or satan and all of his minions but who is him that is god amen fear him fear god reverence god which they will destroy both soul and body and hell are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them excuse me here and a farthing just to tell you is just worth a couple of cent basically the bible one one to two pennies something like that um is is a farthing and two sparrows sold for one barley two sparrows one farley and one of them shall not fall on the ground one not two without your father so god cares about that very sparrow even though two sparrows won't bring but a farthie so we're finding out here that the value that that people put on things is not the same value that god puts on things or the things that are put value upon by humans are not the things that god puts that value on amen notice that that variance here he's telling us see the the world would not care much for the sparrow so much so that two of them would be sold for a penny or two but god values him so much that when one sparrow falls he knows about it it's important to him all of life is important to him we'll get to that in a minute let's finish this he said but the very hairs of your head are old numbers so even the hair is valuable to god i think a lot of us feel that way too but even the hair is valuable to god you haven't lost one praise the lord fear ye not therefore year of more value than many sparrows whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven now we found a value god put a value jesus speaking here puts a value on a farthing on a sparrow he puts that on there realizing and trying to contrast that the man says the sparrow's only worth this but i say the sparrow is worth this so then where does it equal out or where does it matter where does the determination of a human draw value from where do they decide um why is the diamond worth millions of dollars and the rock in my backyard is not worth picking up it's not even worth bending over for uh why is uh certain elements in the world so much more value but because people put value on those things but the value that i'm talking about is not the value that people put on things but the value that god puts on things the thing that matters the most is what god looks at the most now again the value that people have of jesus in their lives a godly life for living a god in life and and i understand and it's good people say they want to accept jesus as their savior and they should and that's that's wonderful we should lead in anybody and everybody that we can to jesus christ uh that's important but the most important thing is has god accepted you that's the most important thing the value that we put on it now the acceptance that we have of jesus christ is going to depend on our actions towards him we say we believe in jesus we say we accept jesus but in that do we actually live the life that jesus would call us to live do we actually live the life and produce the fruits that the bible calls for us to produce that'll show whether or not you've accepted jesus it'll show whether or not he's accepted you because on your own you can't produce that but your your effort your your desire to want to live that way is there and that's the people that god calls so that value is placed in there uh on the individual what does life come to be valued at today you know the united states is one of the few countries in the world that really holds or used to at least hold the human life in such tremendous value you look at some of these rogue nations and some of these rogue religions and those that are very militant and and and violent uh they can lose a hundred soldiers and they don't seem to really care but they capture one american and it turns the whole country upside down if it gets on television or if it gets in the news and you see this one person and of course it happened a lot in the last administration and all you knew is this this rogue group was cutting off americans heads and things like that and but they know that they know how how we value that human life how we value someone that's that's in this world not just an american but in this world we value that person's life and how much it means because it's still a christian nation supposed to be but that that part of it is still there that value is still there these people don't value that they could lose a hundred of theirs to gain one of ours and they don't seem to care weak it seems like a lot of times americans care more about that life than they do of course you know i they believe that in their religion that when they die they're going to paradise in a lap of so many virgins whatever their thought of it is i i'm not relevant to me but anyway uh so they feel like that's that i mean uh and and you know paul said in our religion to to live as christ to die is gain so uh when we go we know it's gain but we we don't lose the value of that life and how much that life means to us how much it means to each uh a a christian an individual and how important and how precious it is but what do people think are important today what is important today what is important to you uh whoever you are watching this today you may stream it now you may archive it later what's important to you what matters to you uh what matters to you should be what matters to god if you're a christian what matters to you should be what matters to god but what value people put on things today people put value on their homes people put great value on their cars people people strive and struggle and and kill themselves to make an extra buck um so what's that value what is the value of a dollar well the dollar can change in value you can look up today what the value of gold is you can look it up tomorrow and it'll probably differ silver precious metals you can look them up today look them up tomorrow they'll be different um eight years ago six seven eight years ago copper was so valuable by the market values of our country that in the world that that people were stealing copper out of air conditioning systems all around the city just to take them and get get an extra dollar or two but now copper's not that valuable anymore and all the thefts quit because it wasn't worth it uh so it's the so what is that what is the importance of value people put value on their spouses on their families uh on their uh relatives and friends they put value on some people put value on um their their jobs and uh their next meal or their next paycheck or or whatever but but the value the point of the value is um what the way god sees that value and the way the human sees that value is totally different the things that we value so much a lot of times in life is really irrelevant to god in a lot of cases it really is not important but we understand through the bible what is important to god look at one of the most important things and seems to be one of the things that's lost a lot in today's society one of the things that god puts a great importance on staying in matthew chapter 16 let's go to verse 24. again very familiar scripture but uh let's read here 24-28 then jesus said unto his disciples this any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me now what value is god putting to that sentence deny yourself take up his cross and follow him amen where's the value god's putting on it now what did these disciples think that they were going to get by following jesus what does anybody think they're going to get from following jesus why do people accept jesus as their savior why do people accept jesus go why do people go to church what do they expect to get from it is it something that they're they're doing because they're expecting something in return are they doing this because they're expecting uh prosperity or blessings well what happens when those prosperity blessings don't come or they don't come in the way you think they should or the the opposite happens and something happens in your life or your family but if you lose a loved one or something god tests us to see so why do people even follow jesus what's the point are we expecting him to take uh and make our lives a bunch of uh puppy dog tales and and smooth paths of rose petals and that's that's not the way it is that's why he said take up your cross and follow me we know what that cross is that crosses death self-denial and follow jesus so what's the value 25th verse for whosoever will save his life shall lose it whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it well that speaks so tremendous to today you lose your life for his sake you'll find it if you find your life or hold your life there and deny christ you'll lose your life so doing for christ is what's the important thing that's where the value should be placed even above your own life the value of serving jesus christ should even be above your own life because he says if you lose it in finding me you will find it where is that on the other side so even if you do that in him you still find it 26 first for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul there we go now god's putting another value on something this value he's putting on a man's soul he's putting on a man's soul the weight of the entire world the entire value of the world of course what is the world worth the world cosmos is not worth a penny in about it the world that we're standing on created by god is is of great value it's a creation of god all of god's creation is of value but notice the monetary value that god is putting jesus again speaking putting on a human soul now as much as people want to discard someone or discredit them or put their opinion or their their voice aside everybody has a soul and brother branham tells us now even jesus is saying here what would a man gain what would a man profit if he gained the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul unfortunately it seems like a lot of people are selling their birthrights their soul out for very little today brother graham said elvis sold his for a fleet of cadillacs uh i think he said that in um an exclamation we don't know that that's absolutely true but uh that's what he said uh but people are selling their souls for a lot less today a lot less even a soul that god put as worth the entire value of the world brother brown tells us the soul is worth 10 million worlds he says 10 000 some places he says 10 million some places i say 10 million because i think the whole point of the subject is that your soul is invaluable you cannot put a price on it now you can't put a price on the harvest down the street you can't put a price on the thief that robbed somebody last night you can't put a price on the president's you can't put a price on anybody's every human soul is worth 10 million worlds not just yours not just your family not just your church every soul every soul is worth 10 minutes worth every life is precious to god now why is life precious people are exchanging their selves uh for this people don't value themselves or value even their time i i find a lot of times people don't even value their time because people will say well it it it only it only cost you this much effort to do something about how much time did it cost how much of your life went out of your body to pay for that that's a value that's a great value to god that's why every life that's born god writes their name on the book of life not the lamb's book of life but the book of life every life born whether it's from an adulterous parents or whether it's from uh drunkards or or drug addicts no matter what that life is precious to god whether it's born in this right mind or not whether it's born with a horrible disease or not whether it's born where whatever it's precious to god every moment of that life is precious to god and it should be precious to us when i was driving i used to tell people that you know sometimes i drop people short distances long distances and would have conversations and and and the conversation like that would come up and i say but you know your time is worth something when you say well i only have to drive here to get this or so long but but how much time are you spending to do it because your time is worth money your time is valuable so all that time matters that life matters it matters to god if it matters to god it should matter to us every one of them no matter who they are everyone's opinion everyone's uh um that's i believe that's why the founding fathers put the first amendment in our constitution the first amendment to amend the constitution to say that we all have a right to express our opinions peacefully all of us do it doesn't happen that way very much anymore because if you're of a certain opinion or you're of a certain uh group i'll just say it without getting political today if you're of a certain group they don't want to hear your voice if you don't say what they want you to want you to say what they want to hear your opinion is nothing well what that does is that devalues that person's life in that person's eyes that other person's life is devalued because their thoughts and opinions don't matter well that's where you get slavery from that's where you get communism from that's where you get oppression from is from people who don't believe another group of people's opinions matter because when your opinion doesn't matter when your thoughts and feelings don't matter then you know you're you're of no value to that person and you're so human at that point that's sad but it seems to be that's exactly where this place is headed or this country where this world is headed to a devaluation of a person's life a devaluation of a person's soul that's of the utmost importance god said what would a man exchange for his soul what is worth this world going to hell for what now i imagine if you told that question to a thousand people a thousand people would probably tell you nothing and they would go live their lives just exactly the way they lived them before sending their souls right directly to hell they're exchanging that for what a lot of people it's not worth 10 million it's more valuable than 10 million worlds jesus said the entire wealth of the world but at the point of that that jesus making it's the same point brother branham made brother branham's not crossing the word he's just saying the same thing jesus said jesus saying it's invaluable that's the whole point jesus is making it's like he told peter when peter said how many times should i forgive my brother [Music] seven times a day seven times how many times should i forgive my brother jesus said not seven but seventy times seven four hundred and ninety if you wanna do the math a day that's a lot of forgiveness for one person to another person in a day 490 times how many times are we willing to forgive uh forgiveness of the great importance not just first your fear giving but for you too but again that's a that's in my book that's a whole another subject but the point of that is the value that's placed on it people don't put value on that because they don't see it as important they think that their car that they drive is more important than that the house they live in is more important that the amount of money they make the biggest the the size of their bank account is more important than that friend there's nothing more important than your soul and your standing with jesus christ there's nothing more important than looking at the person next to you to looking at the person across the street to looking at the person at your job at the supermarket on the begging on the corner wherever you go that that person has a soul worth 10 million worlds now they may not value it to the point that you do but their opinion of themselves should not shape your opinion of them your opinion should be molded by the by christ in the word not by them or anybody else the world might devalue them but they're not of less value they're just as important as any of the rest and that value is just as important so the exchange rate um you talk about exchange and exchange rate of going from one country to a next from a from a ruby to a dollar or from the uh the euro to the dollar the canadian whatever the exchange rate the peso to the dollar my goodness is what 16 000 pesos to a dollar or something today i don't know it's crazy amount uh because their dollar their peso is so devalued in mexico but that exchange rate isn't isn't a very profitable deal but what about the exchange rate of losing your soul the exchanging of your soul going to hell the exchanging of your soul for anything that you can have in this world for anything that you could obtain for anything that you could work for fight for count of value we all live in this world we all eat we all have well most of us have a place to live most of us eat we have to eat or die we all have the things of life that we have and that's okay and there's nothing wrong sweat of our brows we work we earn money we provide for ourselves our families that's absolutely godly uh that's right that's righteous but when you start putting a greater value on that and what it really is then it becomes a detriment of your relationship with jesus christ because then you're placing that in a in a place that's above him now anything that's above him like we said last week in the scripture in revelations talks about names of blasphemy any blasphemous name is something that removes jesus christ or devalues jesus christ we look at these people that are around the world today and don't think nothing about killing another human or don't think anything about talking bad about that person which is murder hating one another which is murder or devaluing or something as simple as devaluing that person's feelings or opinions it's the same thing it's the same opinion you're devaluing that person down to a place that is less than human because you're saying they don't have a right to speak because they're not saying what i want them to say when you date you when you do devalue that you bring them down as a human again that's the beginning of slavery you think someone is less of a human than you are to where they're worthy to be enslaved it's the same thing it's just verbage instead of physical whips and and and physical action but it's the same it's the same principle dominating communism dominating uh nicolaitanism in the spiritual world dominating one person over the other person because that person has been devalued to where they don't have the intelligence or or the spiritual relevance to be able to get god or understand god or follow god or live for god or read his word or be a christian you have to do it because somebody else says they are well friend you only are if god says you are and that's what that's what he values and that's the value that he places on it which is the most important thing to us the world looks at something called supply and demand i'm gonna read one more scripture here we'll close in a minute but they put uh a terminology on the things that we value and place and value uh it's called supply and demand the more somebody wants something the more it tends to be worth when you're a child your your your principles and your values change uh from an infant to a grown adult in most cases young kids don't really care about where the money comes from or how hard mom or daddy works to earn it they just want a new bike or they just want a new toy or they just want to make sure they have food and a place to live that's all they care about the values change drastically but in our supply and demand economy our demand is what uh well the supply to but the demand the supply can be one but if nobody wants that one then that one is worthless now you could have a million of them and nobody wants them that millions worth nothing uh you could have a trillion of them but if two trillion people want it uh is worth twice what somebody the value somebody would put on it because twice as many people wanted as what their hours exist so it's the supply and demand that supply and demand puts that value i used to collect why i still have them my baseball cards from when i was a kid played baseball and a little kid and uh these little pieces of cardboard with a picture on it may be signed maybe not uh depending on how many there are and how many people want them a little bitty square piece of cardboard can be worth thousands of dollars to people thousands of dollars for a little square piece of cardboard but as long as the cardboard's not worth that you take it to a recycle they wouldn't give you a penny for it probably because this piece of cardboard is not worth recycling we recycle for free we give everybody plastic paper and uh glass for free you couldn't get a penny for that little square piece but you put a certain picture on it and you have a lot of people want it it becomes invaluable at that point it works thousands of dollars people pay for it it's kind of strange to me when you really think about it but that that's the value that somebody's willing to place on it so if god values your soul as worth the entire world we'll just say what the bible says the entire value of the world if he places your soul in the entire value of the world then how precious is that to him what does that mean to him see maybe not to other people but to him and that's the value that we look for and value that we want to talk about look at this in micah the book of micah chapter 6 the book of micah chapter six uh verse six will start at you got your bibles there and you want to read just take a moment but in micah chapter six some people may not know where mike gets one of those uh latter prophets right before you get to the new testament um and we'll read from the chapter six actually the book of micah has a lot of good teachings in it but uh the verse six now it says wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god now this is all questions it's all questions mike is asking very very um he read the book of micah uh it's it's just it's really incredibly i want to say intelligent very spiritual uh intelligent person a very astute and had a lot of very poignant questions answers wisdom wisdom but the questions here he's asking questions wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before them before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give him my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul he has showed me old man what is good and what does the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god oh that's a that's just wisdom to me like i said micah and the wisdom that he had here in this statement something of course that was lost in saul uh saw thought that the sacrifices and and the burnt offerings meant more to god than his obedience uh well micah is certainly correct in that say well i could give rivers of oil i could give ten thousands of animals and sacrifices i could give my firstborn of the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul but what does god require what is the requirement of god it was a great thing back in the in the early church ages in the dark ages and people would do their pentance and crawl on their knees and glass and beat themselves with cat of ninetales and all the things that they would do but that wasn't required by god that's required by man man set that up not as a scriptural godly requirement but a man's requirement god doesn't require that god's not looking for human sacrifice understand jesus christ gave his life and shed his blood that we all might be redeemed and come to him as pure holy righteous what does god require like it the old testament again let's read he has shown me o man what is good and what does the lord require thee to do justly to do justly to be just honest reputable before men before people it doesn't mean you're going to be perfect it doesn't mean you're going to do everything right but you're going to be honest about it you're going to be just about it you're going to be truthful about it you know brother brown said when he uh couldn't pay for this medicine from this doctor he said doctor i need this medicine real bad but i don't have the money to pay of course a whole nother day uh doctors and people were different back then the doctors so that's okay uh billy no problem and but he said but you know brother brown supply i owe the debts i'll pay if it's a quarter week i'll pay if i can't pay i'll tell you see it's just being honest it's just being reputable seeing and being just about the about those things live justly and do uh and to love mercy to walk humbly with god love mercy and walk humbly with god now that seems to be one of the greatest things missing today is humility but uh it's still relevant it's still prevalent it's it's still important and meaningful it's still scriptural to be humble to live humbly kind of hard to forgive somebody when you're not humble kind of hard to it's all really easy to hold a grudge when you're not humble it's really easy to get sick when you're not humble too because you're holding all this and mustang and it's all it is really easy to get sick but god says to walk humbly before him that's the things god requires that's not requiring your big mansion god's not requiring your huge bank account god's not requiring your fancy cards or or or anything else he's requiring of those that live justly to love mercy to to to live humbly before him we do those things he'll lead you and guide you into all truth he'll lead you and guide you the way he wants you to live the way he wants to walk things he wants you to do that's the value that god puts on i believe that's the value we should put on it the requirement of god's value see a value has a requirement if you put a value on something there's a requirement to that value well the value god has put on your soul is a whole world the entire monetary value of the world so what's that requirement requirement of that is to live humbly before him to love mercy and to live justly that covers people it covers you and it covers him that trifecta amen most importantly him but us too and other people live justly that's the things that god requires so the requirement that god puts on that value is very simple it's not hard it's not complicated it's not something you have to you have to kill yourself to obtain or earn it's something that god gives it does that is of the greatest value amen that is of the greatest value that gets what what do people think what are people's opinions what is the value that people put on things today people will fill up a sports arena by the tens of thousands and yet um hard to even get a handful of chirps sometimes they'll fill up political events or or restaurants by the hundreds and thousands and tens and hundreds of thousands and where's the value when it comes to the soul it's more important to make sure and catch the football game on sunday than it is to go to church to put god first what is the greatest value what is going to get you to the place that god's requiring amen that's the requirement that god wants based on the value that he's put on you the value that god's put on your life the value that god's put on your soul people want to devalue it but it's no it's of no less value today than it was when god spoke adam into existence everybody's life no matter who they are bride or not they're of all great value that value that'll that hopefully will get to uh get to next week find a segway in the next week we can understand so when we see these things happening it's very subtle how the enemy does but it's very real it's very subtle you think well it's not it's not that big a deal because uh people won't let this person speak or won't hear their opinion or or whatever but it is of great value it is a tremendous uh loss in our society when people uh won't be near to someone else whatever it is you might end them at it you might uh um disagree fully wholeheartedly disagree but that's okay there's nothing wrong with disagreeing what's wrong is not listening that's what's wrong and that's why this is becoming so tilted in one direction this country especially becoming so tilted in one direction and uh and again lord willem maybe we'll talk about that some more next week but i pray that something was said today to apply to our lives to help us uh on our daily journey um and god god would bless us all with it it makes it makes a difference when we really break it down and understand and really take a moment to think about what really is important and what do i hold a value in my life what is important to me see it makes a difference so i pray the lord bless you somehow pray something was said to bless you in a special way and lord willing i have every intention uh by the grace and help of the lord will have church next week so uh thank you for your prayers thank you for being there uh and may the lord jesus bless you again could we just bow our heads as we uh in this moment of prayer now lord jesus again we're very thankful father for what you've given for us what you've done for us lord for showing us and helping us realize the things that are truly important the world will try to put value on things that really are unvaluable to you lord they're not valuable to us lord many times of quite insignificance but lord um we know what is the most valuable thing that you've placed and on this earth today the human the human life the human soul lord is of greater value than we could ever even speak think the lord we know god that your word is is true and what you speak to us from your word and what you require of us lord through your word but it's not something superficial it's not something that you just let slip by it's of great importance to you and we acknowledge that and we thank you for it lord so accept us lord again today help us if we've been putting too great a value on monetary things or something that is really of not great value to you lord help us to be uh more mindful of those things god that they help us realize um the things that are the most important in life why may you just bless and strengthen your people bless all those that listen today and watched and lord bless our congregation exceedingly father we thank you for
