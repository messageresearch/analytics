[42:45] part of a service or uh two or three
[42:48] services so um but we'll uh we'll just
[42:52] try to contain it here to today and try

[44:00] this place this statue Lord that brother
[44:02] randam preached to us that Peter spoke
[44:04] to us about Lord and now that we're
[44:06] trying to go through God that we can
[44:08] reach that place of perfection in this
[44:11] life God not that sinless Perfection
[44:13] we'll have there but Lord that place
[44:15] that you have for us the full embodiment
[44:18] of Jesus Christ in us living through US
[44:21] showing to this world that you are the
[44:24] same yesterday today and forever Let It
[44:26] Be to us now God as we commit ourselves
[44:29] to you and just trust and believe as you
[44:31] spoke to us along the way through this
[44:33] subject God that it would bring true to
[44:36] our hearts and it would Minister to us
[44:38] Lord that we don't forget it we don't
[44:40] let it slip but God we put it and
[44:43] applied in our lives and let it grow in
[44:45] our hearts and sometimes we may not even
[44:47] realize what is going on and what's
[44:49] happening Lord as the word is going
[44:51] forth God it will not return void so we
[44:54] know that in us as we're listening as
[44:57] we're receiving as you're revealing God
[44:59] that it will manifest and grow in us God
[45:03] to be this perfect man that you've
[45:06] called for each of us to be Lord yes God
[45:09] I pray that you'd bless it now and
[45:10] amongst us God and those who have come
[45:12] today Lord may you bless them those who
[45:14] may be streaming those who may even
[45:16] watch it archived Lord just bless them
[45:19] exceedingly we rebuke every demonic
[45:21] spirit that would try to hurt hind or
[45:23] and filtrate this service in any way may
[45:25] you get the glory honor and praise prise
[45:27] for all that is said and done for we
[45:28] commit it to you in the precious holy
[45:31] lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[45:33] Christ we pray amen amen second Peter
[45:38] chapter 1 verse 5 and beside this giving
[45:42] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[45:46] to your virtue knowledge and to
[45:47] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[45:50] patience and to patience godliness and
[45:53] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[45:56] brotherly kindness kindness charity for
[45:58] if these things be in you and abound
[46:01] they make you that ye shall neither be
[46:03] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[46:05] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[46:08] lath these things is blind and cannot
[46:11] see a far off and hath forgotten that he
[46:14] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[46:16] the rather Brethren give diligence to
[46:18] make your calling and election sure for
[46:21] if you do these things you shall never
[46:24] fall you could be seated if you'd like
[46:28] amen as I said we've gone through
[46:32] uh uh a part of Brotherly kindness last
[46:35] week obviously we went through faith
[46:37] virtue knowledge Temperance patience got
[46:39] through godliness last week which took
[46:41] most of our time than kind of delve into
[46:44] the brotherly kindness which I wanted to
[46:45] a little bit because I knew if we didn't
[46:47] do that it wouldn't strike uh what I
[46:51] wanted it to be how how much I I wanted
[46:54] to add to that because uh all these all
[46:58] these attributes all these virtues are
[47:00] so very important to us obviously faith
[47:02] is being the foundation but all of it's
[47:05] so very important to us but when you
[47:06] start getting up to the
[47:08] Capstone it starts getting up to the
[47:10] place like it is here like it is for us
[47:13] today when you start getting closer and
[47:15] closer it starts getting narrower and
[47:17] narrower uh it starts getting more uh uh
[47:22] fundamental uh the
[47:24] seriousness of it increases especially
[47:27] when you get to the place of godliness
[47:29] amen brotherly kindness which again uh
[47:33] to me uh is uh is something outstanding
[47:37] that we should always uh try to attain
[47:41] to because brotherly kindness is above
[47:43] godliness right amen uh to be able to
[47:47] show godliness is to be able to show
[47:49] brotherly kindness like I said last week
[47:52] uh brother bam said God would rather me
[47:54] love you than love him because if I'm
[47:56] loving you I'm loving him so that
[47:58] brotherly kindness gets us and really
[48:01] enps I said brotherly kindness and
[48:03] godliness goes together but really all
[48:05] three of these go together and a few of
[48:07] the scriptures I'm going to read today
[48:10] uh actually encapsulate all three of
[48:12] these attributes amen godliness
[48:14] brotherly kindness and love amen so uh
[48:18] these these get to the place they wanted
[48:20] I I didn't want to go over them quickly
[48:23] wanted to spend more time on them thus
[48:26] brotherly kindness I wanted to spend a
[48:27] little more time on it uh I could have
[48:30] broke off and just put brotherly
[48:31] kindness just for today and then love
[48:33] just for next time but uh I thought
[48:35] maybe that we could bring the two
[48:37] together a little bit better than to
[48:39] spread them out more because it it kind
[48:41] of It kind of Falls in Better Together
[48:45] than if it you you get a week apart and
[48:48] things kind of go away you get two weeks
[48:50] apart and more stuff kind of Falls away
[48:52] and uh sometimes I feel almost like I
[48:57] repetitive and have to repeat myself
[48:59] because a things that was ministered two
[49:01] or three weeks ago is sometimes kind of
[49:04] leaves the Mind unless it's brought to
[49:06] our remembrance right uh so I just felt
[49:09] it's better to try to condense this into
[49:11] two Services instead of three so
[49:13] brotherly kindness brotherly kindness
[49:15] put yourself in someone else's place
[49:18] again walking in the other man's shoes
[49:20] if you will to be affectionate careful
[49:23] of others
[49:24] feelings the way we treat one another is
[49:28] the way that we treat God right amen the
[49:31] way that we treat one another is the way
[49:33] that we would treat God people would say
[49:35] well if God was standing here in a
[49:36] Corporal body well sorry but you would
[49:39] do it exactly the same as you do nowen
[49:41] that's what brother brandom said said
[49:43] you would treat him no you would treat
[49:45] him no differently than you do now amen
[49:47] people say if I had been back in that
[49:49] day well you with Jesus on the earth you
[49:53] treat him exactly the way then as you
[49:55] treat him right now amen and how you
[49:57] treat your brother is exactly the same
[49:59] way you treat God Amen cuz we are the
[50:02] embodiment representation of Jesus
[50:04] Christ on this Earth and even to those
[50:07] humans that may not be born again or
[50:09] even Christians to treat with brotherly
[50:12] kindness amen it's how we that would
[50:15] show how we would treat God Amen God is
[50:19] looking for this when we become like him
[50:23] to reach this place of Brotherly
[50:25] kindness is to be like God
[50:27] to have godliness and to be like God
[50:30] shows the godliness that and the
[50:32] brotherly kindness that uh is the
[50:34] attribute of God's spirit God's spirit
[50:37] in us we went through the godliness uh
[50:39] we talked about last week I read this
[50:41] scripture Matthew 18 2122 I won't uh go
[50:45] on as much as I did last week but I did
[50:46] want to read it
[50:48] again one of the brotherly kindness
[50:50] scriptures that I came up with Was Then
[50:52] Came Peter to him and said Lord how all
[50:56] shall I my sin uh my brother sin against
[50:59] me and I forgive him till seven times
[51:03] Jesus sayth unto him I say not unto thee
[51:06] until seven times but until 70 times
[51:10] seven yes amen again as we've said if
[51:13] you do simple math 7 time 7 he is 490
[51:17] times per person per day that's a lot of
[51:20] forgiveness sadly a lot of times when
[51:23] someone's offended against once they cut
[51:26] they're done right they cut that person
[51:28] off there no forgiveness one time maybe
[51:31] too if some people are really full of a
[51:34] lot of Grace to that person maybe twice
[51:37] how many you know actually 490 times
[51:40] amen like I said Peter probably held the
[51:43] bar real high when he thought he was
[51:45] coming up to Jesus boasting seven
[51:48] thought well that's a lie actually in
[51:50] our Humanity seven is an extraordinary
[51:53] amount Jesus said absolutely not it is
[51:56] unlimit Li mited I my opinion that's
[51:58] what the 490 means amen unlimited at the
[52:02] amount of times you should forgive your
[52:04] brother amen forgiveness should be uh uh
[52:08] should be in us to forgive amen that's
[52:12] hard it is hard I'll be the first to say
[52:14] it forgiving is very difficult because
[52:17] it GRS against the flesh it's very hard
[52:20] to forgive it's even harder to try to
[52:23] forgive and forget amen amen but it is
[52:27] extremely hard uh to forgive but that's
[52:30] an attribute of God that's why having
[52:33] the spirit of God and the full
[52:35] embodiment of Christ in US is the only
[52:38] way that is going to bring us to this
[52:40] place to this statue of a perfect man
[52:43] this this place of perfection is only
[52:45] going to be achieved because you die to
[52:48] yourself because more of us dies and
[52:51] more of Christ lives it's the only way
[52:52] it's going to be reached it's the only
[52:54] way these attributes are going to
[52:56] manifest
[52:57] through your life only way it can be
[52:59] that's why it's so important believe
[53:01] that's why brother Brandon preached it
[53:03] to that way and then uh I'll probably uh
[53:05] read a quote or two that to solidify
[53:08] that the things that brother brandom
[53:09] said about that now let's go over to
[53:11] Romans chapter
[53:13] 12 uh Romans 12 verse
[53:22] 9 amen Romans 129
[53:35] amen Romans 129 let's look at this 9 and
[53:40] 10 let love again like I said some of
[53:44] the uh uh scriptures that's going to
[53:46] encapsulate all three of these
[53:49] attributes let love be without
[53:52] dissimulation or hypocrisy if you will
[53:55] let it be without hypocrisy or uh
[53:58] dissimulation abhor that which is evil
[54:01] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[54:05] affectioned one to another with
[54:07] Brotherly
[54:08] Love in honor preferring preferring one
[54:14] another amen that's the opposite of uh
[54:19] selfishness that's the opposite of
[54:21] self-centered that's the opposite of my
[54:24] Me Myself and no one else amen that is
[54:28] preferring your brother showing
[54:31] brotherly kindness showing brotherly
[54:33] love to let others know that your
[54:36] affection towards them is even more than
[54:39] it is to
[54:40] yourself you prefer others better than
[54:44] you amen that shows a brotherly kindness
[54:47] but it can't be done without that love
[54:50] that love let the love be without
[54:53] hypocrisy Amen Let It Be to where you
[54:56] genuinely love someone you don't you
[54:58] don't the Bible says not to love of
[55:01] course again we're these two are going
[55:02] to inter intermingle uh don't love in
[55:06] word or by the tongue but love in deed
[55:11] and in Works love someone by showing
[55:14] that you love them right produce that
[55:17] brotherly kindness by doing something
[55:20] for your brother or sister by being
[55:23] there for them even if it's something as
[55:25] simple as remembering them or praying
[55:27] for them or a text or a call or a visit
[55:31] something to show you care right that
[55:34] you love them that they're a part of you
[55:36] in your heart as brotherly kindness that
[55:39] love will not be with with hypocrisy it
[55:43] would be without hypocrisy it won't be
[55:45] that you love this one you don't love
[55:47] that one you love that one more than you
[55:48] love that one God's love is perfected in
[55:51] his pride and that love is agape love
[55:54] which is unconditional amen amen that
[55:58] will produce the brotherly kindness that
[56:01] we have to those that are around us amen
[56:03] especially if you will maybe not don't
[56:06] me it to be hypocrisy but our brothers
[56:09] that our brothers and sisters whom we
[56:10] love that we stand shoulder to shoulder
[56:12] with in the faith amen now let's go over
[56:15] to
[56:16] Hebrews chapter 13 we're going to read a
[56:19] couple of verses of scripture there when
[56:22] I'm when I'm through this I got a couple
[56:25] quotes I want read
[56:29] too brotherly kindness now Hebrews 13
[56:33] verse1 let Brotherly Love continue yes
[56:37] amen that's pretty simple isn't it seems
[56:40] Elementary but it's gets right to the
[56:42] point let Brotherly Love continue Amen
[56:46] to continue something means you have to
[56:48] start
[56:49] it if you're going to start it want to
[56:52] continue brotherly kindness uh brotherly
[56:55] love but it's got to start start first
[56:57] that's the whole point for it to
[56:58] continue be not forgetful to entertain
[57:02] strangers for thereby some have
[57:05] entertained angels unaware remember them
[57:08] that are in bonds as uh as bound with
[57:12] them and them which suffer adversity as
[57:16] being yourselves also in the body in
[57:19] other words put yourself in their place
[57:22] amen feel their pain feel their
[57:24] infirmity feel their trans transgression
[57:26] whatever it is feel that Mo move into
[57:30] that for someone else amen if you if you
[57:33] feel that way about somebody else it
[57:35] just proves that you had that true love
[57:38] that genuinely brotherly kindness that
[57:40] Brotherly Love towards that person
[57:42] because you put yourself in their
[57:44] position you've prayed for them as such
[57:47] you've given them support and adoration
[57:50] so that that person knows that you
[57:52] really care that you feel like you've
[57:54] been now see when when when uh someone
[57:57] is sick we pray for that person but we
[58:01] don't pray for it uh for dissimulation
[58:04] or hypocrisy we don't pray for them just
[58:07] because we it's out of Duty that we pray
[58:09] for them we pray for them because we
[58:11] genuinely care about that person we pray
[58:14] for them because if we were in that same
[58:18] position we would want those the others
[58:21] to pray for us right amen amen it's like
[58:24] the feelings of the infirmity ities
[58:28] uh the high priest that's touched by the
[58:31] feeling of our infirmities he feels
[58:33] those infirmities he knows what it's
[58:35] like CU he's been through it yes how
[58:37] many times do we we we we understand uh
[58:41] well we have a live example uh sister uh
[58:48] uh Lydia is going through the cancer
[58:50] brother Dennis has been
[58:52] there I I I I sat with brother Dennis
[58:56] saw some of what he went
[58:58] through but he but I still can't feel
[59:01] what he feels towards her amen as much
[59:04] as I can as much as I love her and I'll
[59:07] enter into that as best as possible he's
[59:09] been there he knows how it feels to take
[59:12] those treatments he knows what it feels
[59:14] like to take those pills and go through
[59:16] that treatment and sit there in that PL
[59:18] he knows what it feels like amen I've
[59:21] only been there I I wasn't plugged to
[59:23] the machine I wasn't taking the pills my
[59:26] wasn't falling out amen I wasn't feeling
[59:28] the the all the side effects but he does
[59:32] and see that's how it should be as much
[59:34] as possible towards one another how that
[59:39] person feels and think but unfortunately
[59:42] it's got to the world that a lot of
[59:43] people today well that's not my problem
[59:46] and I just honestly Saints I absolutely
[59:50] hate that
[59:51] attitude I hate that attitude I get that
[59:54] attitude at work sometimes that people
[59:56] people come up and I'll mention some and
[59:57] say well that's not my problem I hate
[1:00:00] that yeah yes you're a part of this job
[1:00:03] you're a part of this crew you're a part
[1:00:05] of this company you're a part of this
[1:00:07] this actual wash it is your problem yeah
[1:00:10] act like it's your problem do something
[1:00:12] about it don't just push it off and say
[1:00:15] well that's that's their job or or
[1:00:18] that's not my problem let's be a part of
[1:00:21] it don't be a part of the problem be a
[1:00:24] part of the solution amen the only way
[1:00:26] to do that is to enter into that Amen
[1:00:29] Let it become a part of you amen let it
[1:00:32] let let it let it feel in you like they
[1:00:35] would maybe feel as much as you can I
[1:00:38] haven't had cancer by the grace of God
[1:00:39] so I can't feel that way I haven't had a
[1:00:42] a joint replace I I can't feel exactly
[1:00:45] how sister patter brother Dennis NE I I
[1:00:48] can't I don't know that in the in the
[1:00:50] completeness that it is but we can sure
[1:00:53] enter into the place to say I can only

[1:01:50] for others he did because he loved he

[1:01:56] because he wanted you to be in a better
[1:01:59] place he wanted you to be in a better
[1:02:02] position he knew that if he didn't do it
[1:02:04] then all the human race was lost he knew
[1:02:07] if he if he didn't do that there would
[1:02:09] be nobody could take and open that book
[1:02:12] and every name in there would have been

[1:06:23] of Charity love obviously love charity
[1:06:27] uh it says in the Bible charity I put
[1:06:29] love up here because love fits a little
[1:06:30] better than charity uh when I write it

[1:07:25] world does and still be nothing right
[1:07:29] amen because it's love why you say well
[1:07:31] that's what the scripture tells us let's

[1:08:02] tongues of men and angels and have not
[1:08:05] charity I am become as a sounding brass
[1:08:07] or a tinkling symbol amen without the
[1:08:10] Capone what are we amen amen praise the
[1:08:14] Lord all these attributes are great
[1:08:16] friends they're all needful they're all
[1:08:18] need all of them but without the love to
[1:08:21] cap it what good does it do to us we can
[1:08:25] speak with tongues men and angels but if
[1:08:28] we don't have the charity we're a
[1:08:30] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol just
[1:08:32] an undistinguishable noise is all it is
[1:08:36] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:08:39] and understand all Mysteries all
[1:08:40] knowledge though I have all Faith so
[1:08:43] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:08:44] not charity I am nothing you might have
[1:08:48] the faith to be able to move Mount Lemon
[1:08:50] over there and throw it in the Pacific
[1:08:52] Ocean but without this you are nothing
[1:08:55] amen right amen people hang theirselves
[1:09:00] on these tongues and prophecies and
[1:09:02] gifts and doing this and doing that oh
[1:09:05] they did that all through the scripture
[1:09:06] anyway and they said and the group came
[1:09:08] to Jesus and said we did it in your name
[1:09:12] and he still said depart from me you
[1:09:15] workers of iniquity I never knew you
[1:09:18] right I'm
[1:09:20] I amen all Mysteries all knowledge all
[1:09:24] Faith to move mountains don't have
[1:09:26] charity I am nothing though I bestow all
[1:09:28] my goods third verse to feed the poor
[1:09:31] and though I give my body to be burned
[1:09:33] and have not charity it profiteth me
[1:09:37] nothing listen now the attributes of
[1:09:40] Charity love charity love suffereth
[1:09:44] long love is
[1:09:46] kind charity envieth not charity
[1:09:51] vaunteth not itself it's not prideful it
[1:09:54] is not coughed up again not prideful not
[1:09:58] arrogant does not behave itself
[1:10:01] unseemingly the love of God seeketh not
[1:10:04] her own is not easily provoked thinketh
[1:10:08] no evil rejoices the love of God
[1:10:12] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:10:15] in the truth bearing all things
[1:10:19] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:10:23] endureth all things yes
[1:10:26] charity never fail praise the Lord
[1:10:30] that's one of the greatest things about
[1:10:31] charity about love it never fails yeah
[1:10:34] love never fails God is love charity God
[1:10:38] never fails but whether there be
[1:10:41] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[1:10:44] be tongues they shall see whether there
[1:10:46] be knowledge it shall vanish away the
[1:10:49] love of God the great love of God Amen
[1:10:54] that manifests itself self to
[1:10:56] us charity amen bringing bringing
[1:11:02] forth those attributes that God has
[1:11:04] shown us now let's go to the script to
[1:11:07] uh Matthew chapter
[1:11:09] 19 Matthew chapter 19 verse1
[1:11:13] 17 amen without the charity it means
[1:11:16] nothing charity is love love is the love
[1:11:19] of God as we've said before there's uh
[1:11:22] different kinds of love there's the love
[1:11:24] of man which is a fio love uh fileo
[1:11:29] however someone wants to pronounce it
[1:11:31] there's a goo love that's the love of
[1:11:34] God there's aape the love of God in
[1:11:36] action it's the it's still the love of
[1:11:38] God Amen the vilio love man's love is
[1:11:43] conditional comes goes God's love is
[1:11:47] without Condition it's like brother Dena
[1:11:49] said brother Bram came to the point that
[1:11:51] he under that he truly understood the
[1:11:53] love of God and and he said we don't
[1:11:56] love God to try to dodge hell we don't
[1:11:59] love God because he's going to punish us
[1:12:01] someday we love him because of who he is
[1:12:04] period not because uh of what he's done
[1:12:08] for us but just simply because of who he
[1:12:10] is and when you come to that
[1:12:12] understanding that that's God's love
[1:12:14] then that means that regardless of what
[1:12:16] God does we still love him if we still
[1:12:19] love him that way to the point that even
[1:12:22] if he were to sentence me to hell I
[1:12:24] would still still love him if I he said
[1:12:27] if I go with the same affection the same
[1:12:30] way that I am now and if God send me to
[1:12:33] hell I would still love him amen because
[1:12:37] even hell did not
[1:12:39] change his love for God yes amen and how
[1:12:44] many times do do the smallest things in
[1:12:47] life sometimes big things in life but
[1:12:50] how many times did those the
[1:12:52] circumstances of life change people's
[1:12:55] love for God people say they did love
[1:12:59] God but then they left him why God let
[1:13:04] this happen well did you love him
[1:13:07] apparently not because even after that
[1:13:10] if you loved him you'd still love him
[1:13:12] yes because your love wouldn't change it
[1:13:14] does not change based on condition does
[1:13:18] not change based on even where your
[1:13:20] location is like brother bandam said
[1:13:23] doesn't change amen it's still love is
[1:13:26] still the love of
[1:13:29] God uh Matthew 19:17 and he said unto
[1:13:33] him this is again the Rich Young Ruler
[1:13:36] he said unto him why callest thou me
[1:13:38] good there is none good but one that is
[1:13:40] God but if thou wil enter into life keep
[1:13:43] the Commandments he said unto him which
[1:13:46] Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou
[1:13:49] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[1:13:52] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:13:56] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[1:13:59] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:14:03] again brotherly kindness and charity
[1:14:06] working together love thy neighbor love
[1:14:11] thy neighbor as
[1:14:13] thyself amen that is not a part of the
[1:14:16] Ten Commandments but the command that
[1:14:17] God that Jesus gave to this Rich Young
[1:14:20] Ruler right it's in Leviticus but it's
[1:14:24] still the same it's still it's still a
[1:14:26] command of God that God gives us that we
[1:14:28] are to love our neighbor uh uh love our
[1:14:32] neighbor as ourselves what other
[1:14:34] scripture we just read in brotherly
[1:14:36] kindness to esteem others better than
[1:14:38] ourselves now these
[1:14:41] things they're they're great against the
[1:14:43] flesh these things are not easy we can
[1:14:46] sit here and I can talk about it uh we
[1:14:48] can listen to it we can hear brother
[1:14:50] brandom or anybody else say it or talk
[1:14:52] about it or read it in the scripture but
[1:14:54] when we go go outside those doors and it
[1:14:56] comes and applies into our lives and
[1:14:59] these things start coming against us and
[1:15:02] start testing us and start challenging
[1:15:04] us what are we going to do how are we
[1:15:08] going to react that's why so many times
[1:15:11] we may not recognize or realize how much
[1:15:14] the word of God has taken effect in our
[1:15:16] lives because the word will not return
[1:15:18] void right but how much that word is
[1:15:21] taking effect in our lives until we get
[1:15:23] into a position and God does something
[1:15:25] or sends a trial or something and then
[1:15:27] all of a sudden we see something happen
[1:15:29] and say wow that wasn't even me I
[1:15:32] wouldn't have done that in myself I
[1:15:35] would have done this but God through me
[1:15:37] produced his own life and did this to
[1:15:40] this person and forgiveness and love and
[1:15:44] charity and brotherly kindness and the
[1:15:46] fullness of Christ UND displayed amen
[1:15:49] amen when Jesus was sitting there and
[1:15:51] they was smacking upside the head who
[1:15:54] hit you he could could have told them he
[1:15:56] could have played along right with their
[1:15:58] game and said and told them their name
[1:16:01] their address where they live who they
[1:16:03] were what their lineage was what their
[1:16:05] mom and daddy's name is what her mother
[1:16:07] mother mother's made name was down to
[1:16:10] the 10th and 12th and 20th
[1:16:12] generation he could have done it but he
[1:16:15] didn't play their game because he wasn't
[1:16:16] showing for himself he wasn't doing this
[1:16:19] for himself he was doing it for us yes
[1:16:22] he could have turned them to fleas he
[1:16:24] could have turned them to the frogs he
[1:16:26] could have spok them out of existence
[1:16:28] completely if he wanted to right but he
[1:16:31] proved through that how to overcome and
[1:16:35] when it comes to us how do we act or
[1:16:38] react in in conditions what are we going
[1:16:41] to do right how does it manifest itself
[1:16:44] through us and when those times come up
[1:16:46] friend those testing times that's the
[1:16:48] only way to find out yes amen I know
[1:16:51] sometimes when I was doing elect work
[1:16:53] with brother Roger they well you know
[1:16:55] we've done what we can do it was done
[1:16:58] right it should work just fine but you
[1:16:59] don't know until you flip the switch
[1:17:02] right amen when you flip the switch and
[1:17:04] no light comes on you say well I did
[1:17:06] something wrong
[1:17:07] somewhere something's not
[1:17:10] right it's like we do at this job you
[1:17:13] you put this together and say well I did
[1:17:15] it right it's exactly like it's supposed
[1:17:17] to be I don't know what I could have
[1:17:18] done better but you don't know until you
[1:17:20] flip the switch Yeah and we come to a
[1:17:23] place uh Church
[1:17:25] and God speak to us and we think oh yes
[1:17:28] uh wow brotherly kindness yeah I got

[1:17:46] are you going to do is it going to
[1:17:48] operate properly you say I think I've
[1:17:50] done all I can do I think I've done
[1:17:52] everything I'm supposed to do I think
[1:17:54] I'm in the right position position if
[1:17:55] this were to happen I believe I'd know
[1:17:57] how to react but you don't know until
[1:17:59] the flip the the the switches flipped
[1:18:02] amen I've had so many people say oh if I
[1:18:05] won the lottery well I'd tell them well

[1:18:13] the lottery you're coming against God
[1:18:14] already because that's gambling you

[1:18:19] opinion you're you're wrong already but

[1:18:53] switches flip yeah amen that's what God
[1:18:57] does to us so many times the tests the
[1:18:59] trials it's just God flipping a switch
[1:19:02] man we reuke the devil all we want but
[1:19:04] you know God allows the devil to get to
[1:19:06] us for certain reasons certain times
[1:19:08] certain purposes it wants to see the
[1:19:11] test has got to come oh I passed that in
[1:19:15] two beautifully that's the best past job

[1:19:22] know until you pump it up if it's going
[1:19:24] to hold air or not yeah amen God flips
[1:19:29] the switch God pumps God makes sure that
[1:19:32] it's going to hold that it's going to
[1:19:34] stand that Love's got to be tested
[1:19:36] friend amen and God's going to test it
[1:19:39] but that love is what shows us who we
[1:19:42] really are when he came to the test here

[1:20:27] amen you know what his man-made patch on
[1:20:31] that tire blew a hole in it bigger than
[1:20:33] the one that was there to start with and
[1:20:35] that air that that tube deflated as fast
[1:20:38] as it could be pumped up amen light
[1:20:41] didn't come
[1:20:44] on water pipe sprung a lead you can
[1:20:48] think it all day long friend but until
[1:20:50] the pressure is applied until it comes
[1:20:52] down to flipping the switch you don't
[1:20:54] know no right this man thought he had it
[1:20:57] all I've kept all this I've done all
[1:20:59] these things and yet when God flipped
[1:21:01] the switch he could not do it right amen
[1:21:05] the Bible says he could not do it
[1:21:07] because he had great possessions and he
[1:21:09] walked away from Jesus sorrowful now did
[1:21:12] he become a pper no did he become a poor
[1:21:16] man did his life wreak the rest of his
[1:21:19] he become a bum or homeless no he got
[1:21:22] richer he grew greater he got more
[1:21:26] important he got greater stature he had
[1:21:29] to build more barns just to hold all the
[1:21:31] stuff that he got
[1:21:34] amen but the last account we find of him
[1:21:38] he's lifting his eyes up into hell right
[1:21:41] because when the flip the switch was
[1:21:43] flipped he couldn't stand it yes he
[1:21:46] couldn't take it amen and it blew praise

[1:22:12] John was just a man of love this point
[1:22:15] uh pretty much all of first second third
[1:22:19] John is just about love so you could
[1:22:21] actually go and just read all of the all

[1:22:25] going to talk to you about love yes
[1:22:30] Amen Let Let's
[1:22:33] uh see what's if I stay on topic we'll
[1:22:37] be good with this let's go over to the
[1:22:39] let's look at the third chapter first
[1:22:41] John the third
[1:22:43] chapter 11th
[1:22:47] verse 1 John 3:11 for this is the
[1:22:51] message that ye heard from the beginning
[1:22:54] that we should love one another not as
[1:22:57] Cain look now he's given the converse
[1:22:59] example here not as Cain who was of that
[1:23:03] Wicked one and slew his brother and
[1:23:06] wherefore slew he him because his own
[1:23:09] Works were evil and his brothers were
[1:23:13] righteous that's why he killed him
[1:23:16] Marvel not my brother if the world hate
[1:23:18] you we know that we have pass looked how
[1:23:22] we how do we know we know that we have
[1:23:24] pass pass from Death unto life because
[1:23:27] we

[1:23:29] agapo the Brethren he that loveth not
[1:23:33] his brother abideth in death whosoever
[1:23:37] hateth his brother is a
[1:23:39] murderer and ye know not uh and ye know
[1:23:43] that no murderer has entered has eternal
[1:23:46] life abiding in him whereby perceive we
[1:23:49] the love of God because he laid down
[1:23:52] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:23:55] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:24:00] Brethren let let's let's go over to the
[1:24:02] fourth chapter now I wanted to get that
[1:24:05] people say they love one another but
[1:24:07] then they really do hate when it comes
[1:24:09] right down to it when the rubber meets
[1:24:12] the road if you will they find out they
[1:24:14] really don't love them they hate them
[1:24:18] amen one reason biggest reason is
[1:24:21] because the other is good you're evil
[1:24:26] and that's why the world hates a lot of
[1:24:27] times will hate a Christian because of
[1:24:30] your
[1:24:32] attribute your Godly love they hate it
[1:24:36] Bible says it's pouring coals on their
[1:24:38] head U fourth chapter Now 1 John 4 let's
[1:24:43] go down to 13 hereby know that that we
[1:24:47] dwell in him and he in us because he
[1:24:51] hath given us of his spirit and we have
[1:24:54] seen and do testify that the father sent
[1:24:57] the son to be the savior of the world
[1:25:01] whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[1:25:04] the son of God God dwelleth in him and
[1:25:07] he is and he in God and we know and and
[1:25:12] we and we have known and believed the
[1:25:15] love that God have to us God is love and
[1:25:20] he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[1:25:24] God and God in him now we got a whole
[1:25:28] another we got a whole another love

[1:25:34] herein is our love made
[1:25:38] perfect praise the Lord now we get to
[1:25:42] this place this Capstone Christ God
[1:25:46] love now John is speaking of not just a
[1:25:50] love but a perfect love remember and
[1:25:54] remember that when we talk about this
[1:25:56] entire body read some uh verses some uh
[1:26:00] quotes later that brings this whole
[1:26:03] thing into
[1:26:04] view This Love Now is made perfect
[1:26:08] herein is our love made
[1:26:12] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:26:15] day of judgment because as he is so are
[1:26:19] we in this world there is no fear in
[1:26:24] love but perfect love again perfect love
[1:26:29] casteth out fear because fear hath
[1:26:33] torment and that's exactly what the
[1:26:37] world tries to do to control people
[1:26:39] today by fear right I've talked about
[1:26:42] our country and of course going through
[1:26:44] Co and the fear that people put on
[1:26:45] through Co this is this is worldwide
[1:26:49] this is a tactic of the
[1:26:51] devil it was a tactic in the Garden of
[1:26:53] Eden it's a it's a tactic today fear to
[1:26:57] put fear on people is to try to control
[1:27:01] them but fear is torment God doesn't
[1:27:04] torment you so there is no there is no
[1:27:07] fear in God because there's no fear in
[1:27:10] love fear is of the devil fear brings
[1:27:14] torment right fear torments the Mind
[1:27:17] fear torments and the worry of and and
[1:27:20] the torment brings worry the worry of
[1:27:23] what what the next minute the next hour
[1:27:26] the next day the next month the next
[1:27:28] year is going to be we don't even know
[1:27:31] but God knows but love casteth out fear
[1:27:35] God cast out fear because fear had
[1:27:37] torment he that fearth is not made
[1:27:41] perfect in love amen God help us amen
[1:27:45] people run around scared in fear no
[1:27:49] probably no more than I've seen in
[1:27:50] recent memory than there was during the
[1:27:53] co thing people in fear Christians in
[1:27:57] fear I couldn't believe the number of PE
[1:28:00] professing Christians I saw in line that

[1:28:17] ordained for all of us I believe right
[1:28:20] amen I know brother Bram said you could
[1:28:21] go before your time I personally think
[1:28:23] that's an extreme example but I think we
[1:28:26] all have that time when God's done with
[1:28:28] us then God takes us home and if God's
[1:28:31] done and if God's done with you why
[1:28:33] would you not want to go home yeah if my
[1:28:36] usefulness and my purpose for being here
[1:28:38] is over then why would I want to
[1:28:43] stay I mean I understand family and love
[1:28:46] and things like the spouse and think I I
[1:28:49] understand all of course that that
[1:28:50] matters to God understands that but the
[1:28:54] fear is what Satan puts on people
[1:28:57] somebody say I'm I'm afraid to die why
[1:29:00] would you be afraid to die if you're a
[1:29:02] Christian why would you be afraid to die

[1:29:55] his brother whom he has seen how can he

[1:30:51] attributes to the Perfection of this
[1:30:53] perfectness statute of perfect man now

[1:31:29] by these
[1:31:30] things by these
[1:31:32] things but it cannot be completely
[1:31:36] controlled until it completely possesses
[1:31:40] these
[1:31:41] qualities amen cannot be completely
[1:31:44] controlled that's what the Capstone does
[1:31:47] because again Capon is God love God
[1:31:51] controls the whole thing amen it cannot
[1:31:54] bring be brought to that perfect
[1:31:57] position unless it this controls the
[1:32:00] whole thing as he said cannot be
[1:32:04] completely controlled completely
[1:32:06] controlled remember we said people have
[1:32:08] these attributes at points times anybody
[1:32:10] till it completely
[1:32:13] possesses these qualities completely
[1:32:16] amen not in part not here or there not
[1:32:20] for some and not others listen now no
[1:32:22] hypocrisy is not for some people and and
[1:32:26] it's and not for
[1:32:28] others amen it's for everybody the
[1:32:30] completeness of that yes is encapsulated
[1:32:34] the
[1:32:35] Capstone now let's read this
[1:32:38] scripture Galatians chapter 6 verse
[1:32:41] 5 or 5 Verse 6 excuse me Galatians
[1:32:47] 56 for in
[1:32:49] Jesus for in Jesus Christ neither
[1:32:52] circumcision availeth anything
[1:32:54] nor
[1:32:56] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[1:32:59] by love amen now you've got the whole
[1:33:04] thing Faith which
[1:33:07] works by love
[1:33:09] amen encapsulates the whole thing Faith
[1:33:14] which is the
[1:33:15] foundation operates by
[1:33:18] love amen only way your faith can
[1:33:22] operate is by love yes your faith
[1:33:24] doesn't operate based on your uh your
[1:33:27] intellect or your will or your desire
[1:33:31] for something your faith operates off
[1:33:33] the love which brings us back to that
[1:33:36] same point of Brotherly kindness putting
[1:33:39] yourself in their position what does
[1:33:42] that do the love operates the faith the
[1:33:46] love for that person the brotherly
[1:33:49] kindness to generate through the
[1:33:51] godliness will generate a faith in you
[1:33:54] that will manifest for that person to
[1:33:57] bring healing or salvation or whatever
[1:34:01] the need may be whatever the prayer may
[1:34:04] be the faith is operated by the love if
[1:34:08] you have faith is I've got faith to
[1:34:10] believe pray for a person but if it does
[1:34:12] if there's no love there what does what
[1:34:14] good does it do right it doesn't produce
[1:34:18] anything the faith won't operate like it
[1:34:20] should remember the effectual prayer
[1:34:25] effectual is the
[1:34:27] passionate prayer the love of the prayer
[1:34:31] that what that's what will generate the
[1:34:32] faith that's what ignites the faith amen
[1:34:37] that's why a lot of people
[1:34:38] know it shouldn't but makes a difference
[1:34:42] if it's someone you're praying for a
[1:34:44] stranger or something versus someone
[1:34:46] that you know or your family member or
[1:34:49] your immediate
[1:34:52] family who you think well I love my wife
[1:34:55] more than I love the stranger on the

[1:35:21] as much as I do her yes and as much as I
[1:35:24] would myself amen that Faith then now
[1:35:28] operates that love it's that's something
[1:35:30] that's effectual then it's a desire that
[1:35:33] we have it's not something manufactured
[1:35:35] or made up because you can't make it up
[1:35:37] you can't fake it you can try to produce
[1:35:40] a little bit of it here and there for a
[1:35:41] while but it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:35:43] make this whole thing operate now we've

[1:37:41] condensing trying trying to draw near to
[1:37:44] his people so he can be loved and
[1:37:47] worshiped and we' in the leodan age

[1:38:12] us this is what God is trying to control
[1:38:17] Us by say control
[1:38:20] absolutely amen but he can only do it
[1:38:23] because free moral agents if we allow
[1:38:25] him right amen which again means Newton
[1:38:29] dying to himself letting God live he's
[1:38:34] got to have a church as I said last
[1:38:37] night that Capstone to come
[1:38:39] on it's got to come on their perfect and
[1:38:44] the church has got to draw into that
[1:38:49] Perfection amen you say perfection he
[1:38:51] said yes he said be you there therefore
[1:38:53] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:38:55] perfect
[1:38:57] amen praise the Lord statute of a
[1:39:00] perfect man these people who died in
[1:39:02] there he's talking about Hebrews 11 now
[1:39:04] the end of the back end of Hebrews 11
[1:39:07] those SAA and sa and caves and stuff
[1:39:10] those people died in there depending and
[1:39:12] waiting on us so this church has got to
[1:39:16] come to perfection in order to bring the
[1:39:20] resurrection God helped me I want to I I
[1:39:24] want to do my part yes to put for this
[1:39:27] old man to be in that position for the
[1:39:30] resurrection to take place yes I mean
[1:39:32] brother Brown said several times that
[1:39:34] the Rapture was overdue God help us let
[1:39:37] us get into the position the place to
[1:39:41] where it will bring that Resurrection
[1:39:43] that's what we're looking for that's
[1:39:45] what we need that's what we desire
[1:39:47] greatly in on Earth now perfect Faith
[1:39:50] look now the identification of a
[1:39:52] scriptural Christian the identification
[1:39:55] of a scriptural Christian that could
[1:39:56] have been a good title for this too the
[1:39:59] the identification of a scriptural
[1:40:02] Christian guess again that would that
[1:40:04] could have been a good title here these
[1:40:06] words said Jesus these signs shall
[1:40:09] follow them that believe now how can you
[1:40:12] call yourself a Believer a people and
[1:40:15] deny those
[1:40:17] words my mind how can you call yourself
[1:40:21] a Believer and deny any of this word see
[1:40:24] you can't do
[1:40:25] it you're not a Believer therefore signs
[1:40:29] signs can't follow you because you just
[1:40:33] accept what you want to believe and the
[1:40:35] rest of it you don't want to believe it
[1:40:37] but you got to take the whole thing and
[1:40:39] believe it and when truly and when you
[1:40:41] truly believe not make believe but
[1:40:44] really believe then these signs will
[1:40:46] follow the believer One More as I close
[1:40:49] here amen one more statue perfect man
[1:40:54] again um he said I pledge this morning
[1:40:58] to make him look now I hope we all do
[1:41:02] this God help me I pledge I pledge let
[1:41:05] not be something I'm
[1:41:07] reading me I pledge this morning to him
[1:41:11] with all my heart that by his help and
[1:41:14] by his grace I pray that I will seek
[1:41:17] daily without ceasing until I feel every
[1:41:21] one of these requirements following in
[1:41:23] this little old stature of
[1:41:25] mine amen God let it be yes a pledge is
[1:41:30] it a pledge that we have to live up to
[1:41:32] till I can be till I can be a
[1:41:35] manifestation of the living Christ for
[1:41:38] he became sin like me that I might
[1:41:40] become the very righteousness of God
[1:41:43] like him he took my place so I could
[1:41:46] take his yes praise the Lord in the
