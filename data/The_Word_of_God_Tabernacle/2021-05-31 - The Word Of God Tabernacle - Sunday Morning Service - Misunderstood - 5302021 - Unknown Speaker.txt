till heaven is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] yes granted jesus that's my prayer lord hey man hey all right we have several fair requests written down here this morning so i'll go ahead and start reading over them so this one's from i believe sister sheila may have written it over man i was probably probably wasn't that you know i'm not like thinking about it um this is from sister sheila and the bell stereo so they asked that we remember brother art and prayer he is having stomach cramps this morning so definitely ask the lord to touch them and also remember sister shelia in prayer she got very little sleep last night and is very tired so ask that the lord will give her strength and rest uh this one is from sister olivia please pray for my brother danny he remains in the hospital due to his setback and his recovery from a stroke also my nephew gabriel via needs a healing touch amen you may have to remember those this morning jesus this one's from uh brother patricia echol here our grandson is in the uh a gay marriage and i don't know how to tell him about what god thinks about his situation she asked that we pray that god would show her the way to approach him without offending him and cause him uh not to talk to her anymore she says that every time she approaches him about it he gets offended and says he prays to god and he and his partner both pray so definitely want to remember that situation as well amen amen uh let's just stand as we take these needs to lord and if you have unspoken prayer requests just lift making known to the lord with it brother yes oh sorry go ahead my mom oh yes yes sister bennett this morning is out um at home uh she's still feeling sick she got i'm not sure if it's still from what happened friday yeah on the way home on friday she got really car sick uh and she uh we had to stop a few times but uh she was feeling better i think yesterday from what she told us but i guess today just came back so i'm still feeling better just you know getting in the car right now is not wisdom okay definitely ask that the lord touch her and completely hillary this morning i mean anyone else just quit mentions all right brother would you mind just praying all over the scenes this morning lord jesus we power our hearts and unison believing that we serve a living god god is mindful of all our needs we know father in these trying times it's obvious the enemy is fighting us harder than ever but when you say when he comes in like a flood you'll always raise that standard amen and father without you will surely fail without you we are nothing and lord give us the revelation the understanding that it has to be you in its entirety father get us out of the way that we may as paul says i die daily how much more does that reflect on us as believers father we must die to ourselves let you be able to express yourself fully in his father for we are needy people father we know that the battle is not ours the fight is not ours father it's yours greater he it's in us than he that's in the world and there's many that need a healing touch from you sister sonia and um uh sister lydia's brother and nephew and and all the other ones that are relying from from the great physician who come on the scene for thou art a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed it's a finished work and calvary that you accomplished for us when he said it is finished that means it was paid fully that the bill has been paid in full and we believe father and the situation lord with our sister pat and and their nephew or where whatever the person is father it's a age where sin is taking prevalence it's sin is just trying to fit in as a norm but as believers give us the faith to stand on your word no matter what and this is a heart situation gift our sister and our brother wisdom to be able to share your truth and um knowing as brother braham said if the word offends then let the people be offended but father give them grace and wisdom how to approach this situation and lord i'm seeing it all in advertisements and commercials they're trying to put that homosexuality is normal it's not father we are believers let us stay with your word to the end father grant and lord grant each and every heart that raised their hand lord you know their hearts desire father may you just grant them whatever they have need of may their cup runeth over may they truly say that i have met with jesus i am happy and there's joy in my heart it's because god has met my need grant the lord bless our pastor as he labors and brings forth your word lord use them to speak to our hearts lord may our hearts be open to receive what you have before us this morning granted lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ praise him amen amen thank you so much i just want to go over some of the testimonies uh this morning so uh we had a birthday last week uh brother micah last wednesday i don't know if he wants me to say his age but i turned 31 last week so we uh went so we celebrated it along with uh brother ben and sister ben it's anniversary on the trip so uh happy anniversary to them tomorrow amen amen um also a couple other pray one more praise report ran down here from brother patricia as well sister sorry sister patricia uh i want to share something with you you may remember the last months i have been hurting really bad in my hips after x-rays showed no damage to joints um not sure brew citiz hopefully i pronounced that right it was probable diagnosis this was not a doctor's suggestion the x-ray reading was all i had to go by not seeing doctor as of yet i looked on youtube for hip pain on there i found some stretching exercises for hip pain and after doing these stretches i now do not have the pain when i get up and walk uh get up and down and walk amen amen the lord works in our lives with many different ways i am very sure your prayers for me were the greatest reason for god showing me the way to deal with my cane i appreciate your prayers and please know i pray for each of you and found these often taking time to pray for others is one way we love one another it's been a real struggle since i've been helping derrick because he has so much need and and i'm hearing him trying to start a home business and growing microgreens and trying to help him because he can't work he's meant he he's a he's been so whacked out by all the drugs since he's been taking since he was four that he has trouble focusing and things like that and he wants the work and he wants to be a part of the world and he can't because of his disability and so i've just really been struggling with this i mean i had a difficult time getting to church a couple weeks ago i had to sell screws and bring him stuff back to the hardware store to refund so i'd have gas to get here i mean it's been rough and so i got a call i was just asking the lord lord you know i'm doing everything i can do and um and and i got a call this morning it was eight o'clock i was hoping to have time to pray and instead i get this call at eight o'clock at this neighbor upstairs her boyfriend committed suicide and i was and i was there with her when it happened the police were there and everything and it was and she was very distraught i told her my door is always open to you and she takes that up she see it there at 11 o'clock at night and whatever and bringing on her entourage and she just needed to talk and she called me this morning she thanked me for always being there for her and and she's getting closer to the lord because of this and she said you're one of the only people that you know um you know you're you're a real neighbor she had to move and um and so she said i've just joined a a it's a phila philanthropic um club that supports the rialto theater and so she said i thought of you she said i want to help you so i'm meeting with her you know in the next couple days or so and she's going to help me to get started and help him i wow oh yes um i know that a lot of you have been praying for me i know my mom's been having me pray for me but i have i have a few miracles that i want to share with you guys but i don't have time for it all but um the last six months of my life have been amazing it's been a struggle but it's been amazing but i want to say that the other day i was really destitute i was just right now i am homeless i know my mom doesn't like that word homeless but right now i am seeking god's will in my life and i was destitute the other day because i had to get rid of my ducks i had some ducks that i really loved and i had to get rid of them and i got up one morning and i was just so i went to the lake and i sat down at a tree and as i was just you know enjoying the geese they started to come out of the water and all just came and gathered around wow and i've got it on recording and as they're coming up to me and i don't know if anybody's familiar with canadian geese but i looked this up geese are very humble when they walk they bow but these geese were it was god's presence i know it was because they were bowing and they were coming within arm's reach of me so i texted a friend of mine and i'm like do do canadian views just come up to you do they did they attack or am i okay you know she's like there it's she goes oh my goodness it's god showing you he loves you and that it was just i just wanted to share that with you but also pray for me um i've had a very traumatic life and god has shown me that i need to write a book about it and i started it but it gave me strength that god gave me strength and the words because i my grammar is horrible i sure will in that thank you all right does anyone have a song [Music] i've seen this one many times but uh coming back from san diego it's so beautiful there um it just made me think how much more beautiful evan's heavens so feel free to sing with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] anymore [Music] and someday [Music] shall be and now i'm looking great across to wear my faith there's just a few more days and then we're gonna take our heavenly [Music]

in jesus amen praise the lord behind that inner veil there's rest in christ praise the lord he giveth us rest that we can stand in the middle of the tumultuous world that we live in and we can feel rest and peace amen and know that god has everything under control yes know that you could be in the middle of a hurricane in the tornado or the biggest storm you've ever had in your life and know that you can rest it can be at peace you know god's watching over you taking care of you helping you amen we've heard a couple of testimonies today of things that have gone from really bad situations to the lord uh making it right or blessing us to see the the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel amen as it were but uh we're so thankful that god is always mindful of us i'm so thankful he never leaves us or forsakes us amen and i'm so thankful to be back here again today god bless you we certainly do miss you all so very much i appreciate brother roger and brother john taking uh the service for us last sunday and uh trust it was a blessing to you to help and of course brother dennis taking the bags and of course if you didn't come none of that would be needed so but i'm very so god bless you thank you amen for being here i had some requests and those that aren't here today so please continue to remember them in prayer um as you know my wife usually um when she travels has elevation changes and things she can get kind of ill and of course nobody knows that probably better than sister norma myself she experienced it firsthand one time but she she felt more normal yesterday and she was fine this morning she just her head was just so swimming to the point that she just didn't feel like she could get back in the car again so please continue to remember her in prayer i know the lord's already touched her and she's going to be fine we've been through this well ever since i've known her really so just appreciate your prayers she had this when she was a kid her parents were both teachers and they owned an rv so when school ended they all hopped in their rv and took off and that's all they did they were on the road all summer and she would get so sick and her mother thought she was just trying to get attention and stuff and tried offered no help no sympathy in fact just the opposite i'd tell you something that would gross you out but i'm not gonna do that but uh just she was just very uh obstinate and it was hard on sonia because she lived her whole life that way basically growing up so so i know what it's about and she's done better at trying to take care of it and and cut it off and not let it happen but you know just didn't realize the change in elevation stuff and the trip and the curvy roads going into san diego going out if you've ever been there you know when you get past el centro it goes up the hill and you know you get up to 4 200 feet so you know things like that it's just it's just uh it just affects her body her brain her head whatever in ways but she wanted to be here and told me to tell y'all hello and she loves you and hate that we weren't here today last sunday we spent the service with brother david zavala was real good we sang every week i forgot how it was when i've been there before several times but they sing every song twice uh at least twice because he sang every er every verse in in spanish and then every verse in english he sang it twice and then the uh the the chorus too so uh but it was it was a real blessing uh a brother that's there at his church ministered uh so it was good to see brother david and his wife again and those there like precious faith and had a good trip and appreciate each one of your prayers and thankful to be home amen enjoyed it and got a rest now from the vacation didn't even leave the apartment yesterday just trying to get some rest but um we're thankful that god blessed us and had a good trip and a safe trip and uh and glad to be back with you all so amen appreciate you love you last sunday i i left my suit my i left my suit hanging on my uh dresser usually i pack it in my bag so when i pack stuff it goes out of my mind and but i decided to just hang it in the van instead of packing it in my suitcase and i forgot all about it so last week out last week for the first time maybe ever i went to church with blue jeans and tennis shoes on but but i did i did hold true to a principle that i try to follow and that principle is i try to go to church wearing the best that i have that's exactly and i went to church last sunday with the best that i had at that time so i still held that principle even though i felt kind of like a bump no offense but that's you know some people it's just it's just different for me it just feels different for me that's awesome right i got up that morning and i took a shower and i looked in the mirror and i decided not to shave i started looking like dennis and danny over there i didn't shave again till this morning i had the first time i think ever in my life again this is a thing for first times i guess i hadn't shaved for two weeks um so it was very different very strange i looked very strange and was very happy no offense but i was very happy to get it off uh this morning so uh but again it's an honor to be here uh remember the request there's again those that are having some issues struggling and sickness and things but god is with us appreciate brother josh's family being here and sister kathy of course and i surely appreciate that testimony i was just wonderful because i've been around ducks and canadian geese and they don't come to you like that unless you're feeding them or something and then if you're feeding them and you quit feeding them they get aggressive uh so but they come that that was that was beautiful i i would agree with you i would just consider that to be the hand of the lord amen so i appreciate each one of you love you let's stand if we could now we're going to go to the scripture saint john chapter 7. we're just going to read one verse of scripture here and take a little bit a short service today amen appreciate the strength of the lord i feel good today thank the lord bless this kind of a as you know if you're going on family vacations they get tiring but but i'm thankful the lord gave us strength to be able to do that i i thank god for help i thank god me and sonia were tired yesterday i talked to i said i said but i'm so thankful that we're in the condition physically that we can go and we can do and we can play and have fun and things like that and and i really do appreciate that i don't want to take my health for granted right that god blessed us with and i feel strong today and i'm looking forward to our 36th anniversary tomorrow i would in front of all of you uh wish my lovely wife a 36th anniversary but she's not here gabriel had his uh was he seven six or seven gabriel i can't remember that look at his track gabriel's birthday party was yesterday too so he's not here but wish him happy birthday sir i said to him they're going to stream maybe he's streaming so happy birthday to you gabriel amen so saint john chapter 7. we'll uh read verse 17 before we let you be seated but before we do that let's just fire our heads for another word of prayer lord jesus it's certainly a privilege lord to be to be here again today i'm so thankful lord to have been able to meet with friends and be together with those of like precious faith last sunday but god there's just absolutely no place like being home these people here and i listened to brother branham say that about his tabernacle and when he lived in arizona and he would go back and he could be with his family and with this home church like that again it meant so much to him lord he said there's just nothing like you people and god i feel that way here and feel that way about these people and being here today god is such an honor and a privilege and i'm so thankful that you give us the health and strength and life to be able to serve you again for one more day lord we not promise tomorrow lord but this one day you've given us just this one more we don't know how many more we'll have if any but we just serve you in this day that you've given us thank you for blessing us for watching over for keeping us thank you for your holy spirit lord to come and sweeping through this place god with a prayer requests the testimonies the prayers and lord we just know that you love us god and lord we know because you love us you love those who we love because you love us and those that we have prayer requests and our family and friends and people we know and request that we hold up before you lord we know you love them because you love us and we love them we thank you god for that precious love that you give us thank you for the ability to be able to stand here today and open up the pages of this beautiful word may pray pray god that you may reveal it to us once again today just a simple thought you give to me maybe from the sunday before last god to follow up with but god would just pray that you would just sink it into our hearts and help it become real to us lord and become a life lesson that you would show us through this yes we'll dedicate and commit the remainder of this service as we have thus far in your hands and pray once again that everything we do and say be pleasing to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen saint john chapter 7 verse 17. saint john 7 17 if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself you could be seated if you'd like the dividing line that jesus drew as the pharisees sadducees as they often did tried to tempt jesus right jesus drawing a dividing line with them to help them understand it to help them get to a place of uh of reasoning to to see who they are and where they stand and that dividing line here is although he's had many dividing lines of jesus put forth for them over the time that he was there this dividing line said if any man will do his will so what he's saying is if anyone will do the will of god okay so if anybody doing the will of god or has the will to do god's will you know sometimes we end up falling into god's permissive will because we actually don't go into his perfect will so we fall and i've told you how i feel about that and that's failure in my life if i'm in his permissive will but but the fact that i want to do my will and purpose in life is to do his will and he knows your heart and he knows whether you really want to do the will of god in your life or not he knows that and if he knows that and knows your heart that dividing line jesus is giving is if your will is to do the will of god if you will do the will of god then you will know whether it's his word or not right god will reveal it to you god will show it to you so that you know that it's him there won't be a question because people a lot of times will say well how do you know well they read the bible and this church reads the bible and they pray all the time and they have prayer meetings and different people they they have their ways of expressing their uh thoughts and ways and their desires to the lord jesus and and and with the bible or with their church or whatever it is but the bottom line of all of that is every denomination every religious belief every book that's out there about godliness or holiness or christianity or muslim or hindu whatever it is the bottom line of the whole thing is if we'll do the will of god we'll know what the truth is god will reveal to you what the truth is and that's what jesus is telling them if you have the will to do the will of god and you will do the will of god you will know of the doctrine you will know whether it's of god or not amen you'll know whether it's god or not or if it's just some man popping off or just somebody speaking on behalf of themselves or some other entity or some other deity you'll know whether it's of god or not and that's the point that jesus is trying to make do his will how do we know that we do the will of the lord be born again it comes down to having the holy ghost again you have the holy ghost your desire is to do the will of the lord god will reveal to you what his truth is what his word is see look there's so many different i guess i'll call them doctrines there's so many different beliefs there's so many different doctrines there's so many different offshoots even in this message i mean i wrote down a dozen or so without even hardly thinking about it right and some of them may be more than there were then we know brother green talked about the nine that he talked about brother bran i told him you'll find there's nine different interpretations of my message and brother greene seemed to find out that he thought that the ninth one was his own uh but they said your brother brown told him you'll find nine i counted about 12 or so without even thinking about it today now how many more maybe that i don't even know about i i don't travel in a lot of the well-known message circles so there may be some things that i don't even know about you hear about things but the bottom line of all that again if you desire and you do the will of god god will make sure and put you in the place where you the word of god is being ministered where the word of god is being brought forth yes it will alleviate and it will it will disseminate everything that god gives you in his word and show you what the truth really is and put you in a place where the ministering of the word is happening and the truth of the word is being preached amen and when he does that then you continue to do the will of the lord as he continues to feed you his word and that that relationship just continues to grow right that relationship gets stronger and stronger now the subject i want to talk about today is misunderstood now it had been on my heart for weeks and i almost wasn't going to do it today uh yesterday you know most of you know i spend most of my saturday trying to get spend more time with the lord for today and uh and as i was praying about it uh a different thought came to me but within the context of what i'm talking about today so i felt that was the confirmation of the lord for this and and also a follow-up kind of for two weeks ago our fifth anniversary we had the service that we had here when i talked about the body and the family of god and that and this goes right along with it the subject here is misunderstood or misunderstanding or someone that is misunderstood i like to give grace and i i just i i don't i've just always been that way my whole life i tried to anyway and i still try to as best as i can i know the dividing line that that jesus brought that brother branham brought what is the word and i still hold a hard and fast to the word period but that doesn't mean that i disfellowship or disassociate with somebody who disagrees with me or that i might disagree with right i'm not going to disassociate with that brother look if i do really believe that i'm right if i do really feel that he's wrong then it's my duty to try to fellowship that person and to help them not to counsel them not to degrade them or put them down or make them feel like they're less than i am but just be a brother right just show kindness just show love just be a a part of the body to bring it all together that that's how people are won people aren't one because it's you you feel like you're this outstanding orator or this this great doctor of divinity or something or you have everything figured out and all the scripture and the message right right it doesn't come like that it comes with love and compassion and showing somebody you really care amen you really do love them and you really do care and yes i do believe i wouldn't be up here as a hypocrite i really do believe that what i feel the lord has revealed to me in this word in this message is the truth i do believe that and i do believe that brother greene gave a balance to that message as well i absolutely do i believe that's why god put me there in that position because i wouldn't have stayed there if i hadn't been right but all that being said i like to show grace right and mercy even if i feel someone is grossly wrong now i might i might warn somebody if i know somebody's preaching an error and somebody asked me i said well you know you do what you feel led to do that's the first thing i would always tell you to do that's the first thing i'd always tell anybody to do you do what you feel led to do right i mean brother zavala he didn't this time but he's asked me in the past years ago when i've gone to visit whether he should leave san diego or not i said brother you've got to do what you feel like to do because people say oh you got to get out of california as quick as you can well maybe that's true but you better obey the lord first because if you obey the lord i don't care where you are god's going to take care of you that's right amen god's going to bless you and increase you and help you with wherever you are so first and foremost do what you feel led to do second though i would say you might want to watch some of the doctrine because you you want to make sure that people don't go off in error because they can't happen that's the protection that that the shepherd gives to the sheep right god's the same way that's why jesus was telling them if you do the will of god god will show you whether it's the truth or not i've been in meetings i i told you all the other day uh me and my wife we've you know since we've come to the lord and we're baptized filled with the holy ghost uh gone to church all the time uh there was times in our life in our young life and with our children that we were in church three or four or five times a week sometimes we would attend 20 20 church services in a month uh because in the south you know this they're having special meetings and they're having tip meetings and we'd drive to virginia then we'd drive to florida and then we'd drive here and we and we would go to meetings and go to happy valley and we were all over the place just to be in church we were there to go fellowship uh with those of like precious faith and be in church and that was our desire that's what we wanted to do and and that's how we lived our lives and that's how we raised our children and that's how uh uh that the lord blesses it see but i've been in many services where uh where there's things that were said and i don't forgive me because i'm trying to make sure i choose my words properly that i that i did not agree with that i personally didn't see in the message or in the word that i didn't see maybe this person had a further revelation something i don't know i would afford them that opportunity right because we're all brothers right and if i disagree doesn't matter maybe i'm the one that needs a little more light on that scripture or a little more light on that subject maybe i'm the one that needs that lord help me right reveal it to me let me know if i need to be where that is then that's fine but when when something is said and and you sat there and i would sit there and even my wife too a lot of times something would be said and me and my wife in unison would look at each other because he hit both of us at the same time the same way because that i always called it a bell brother brown brother green told me don't call it a bell that's god in your life amen i said i agree with that that's just how i denoted it something would go off the holy spirit what that that was in me would say there's no that's there's and people all around are up and screaming and yelling clapping and carrying on and uh can't hardly think nothing nothing wrong with uh exuberance and emotion and praising the lord and worshiping at the truth of the word and nothing wrong with that i encourage that 100 percent but what the variance there was that i'm me and my wife are sitting here looking at each other thinking that's not right that's not scriptural and people all around us are are worshiping about it and i and i'm thinking lord am i missing something is there something but the point of my subject or the point of my that that story is if we'll do the will of god god will show you you can even be setting in a place that something that is not true is spoken and god will speak to your heart and let you know that's not right amen that's the holy spirit in your life that's god speaking to you that's a fulfillment of jesus word that says you do the will of god in your life and god will let you know what his word is he will reveal to you that doctrine of his word that he wants you to know it's that simple amen so there will be no misunderstanding but there are plenty of them plenty of them friend and we'll go into a few of it a few of it today but i want to derive the topic for today from this next scripture in saint john chapter 21. saint john chapter 21 the very thing that i'm talking about is scriptural it happened in the bible saint john chapter 21 and how easy it is how easy it is to to to be misunderstood or to misunderstand amen it's very important that and i've i've done it many many times i'm sure but it's very important that we try to shoot choose our word speak properly speak as the lord would give it in in sentences now i found that it was a complication in life years ago but i've found it's become much more prevalent now that texting has become so prevalent because everybody when you're texting you you shut your text down to as short as you can a lot of times and you'll you'll leave out certain words because you know what you're talking about but the person you're texting may not get the context of your text because you're leaving those words out and i've had it happen to me so many times even between me and sonia she'll text back and say what are you talking about i said well this and this and this well why didn't you say that you know you leave a word out out here the word and misunderstandings happen because of that right now those are simple misunderstandings but when when those things hit a different level between two different other people or something as subject that's more important then it can become an issue that people become misunderstood so it's very important to make sure that that when we're trying to communicate that we can that we communicate properly and and in a way that it doesn't allow for misunderstanding remember the schism from last week or not last week before last the schism that we talked about that that shim the end of it is so tiny it doesn't take but just the slightest tiniest itty-bittiest little misunderstanding to start off a doctrine or to start off a disagreement or to start off a division that'll divide a church and divide people it doesn't take but just that little bit of misunderstanding somebody will come away from that and they won't say anything but they'll say you know what brother so-and-so said right well that might have been what brother bro so and so said maybe but it certainly wasn't the context of what they were saying the problem was they didn't say it with the full context to disallow this in any misunderstanding right and i hope i'm making myself understood you understand and that and that happens so much in texting but it happens in communication and it's it's a tool that the devil can use to drive a wedge right to to bring a disagreement or a misunderstanding when that wasn't the intention at all relationships uh friendships can be broken and divided for that very thing not only that but mis interpretations now you see where this comes along and how this happens because remember the three things brother branham said never to do with the word of god misplace misinterpret or dislocate right now there's a there's a thing that goes with each of those but that's not our subject for today but we're not to misinterpret misplace or dislocate the word in any way and see that's happens a lot of times people will misrepresent something and take it to another person and it may be about the word it may be about a church it may be about something else then a misunderstanding happens the person is misunderstood because of misrepresentation or it's misrepresented it wasn't said and how many times have you anybody ever said gone camping or set the gossip circle you got 15 20 people in a circle and you start out a subject and you just just a simple sentence uh joel likes to eat popcorn well by the time it goes all the way around here he his name's not even joel anymore it's somebody else so the king of the world and uh they've uh popped off at somebody else and it just you know you ever been in the gospel you just go from one to the next and and the initial story what isn't even close to what comes back around because each person it goes through misrepresents what actually was said oh well that sounded like what they said well then where do you go that's why we always try to make sure that our desire is to do the will of god because the will of god in our life will always bring us back around to the place that it's supposed to be and god will reveal to you the truth of what you're supposed to know and what your life is now no now notice there are things that others may know that you don't know or others may know that i don't know the lord reveals to us in different ways we're not cookie cutter christians we weren't put out on a conveyor belt with a stamp stamping each one of us out and we all came along and god said there's one there's one there's one and we walk around as robots we're not cookie cutter christians right we all had different lives we all had different upbringings and god reveals things to us brother branham said as we have need of knowing it so sometimes there's things you may not know that somebody else might know well don't discount that person and that person should not discount you right god hasn't revealed that to you yet right maybe it's just a simple misunderstanding just like this let's read this saint john chapter 21 now again this is building on that body the body of christ to help to help understanding that we understand one another better amen the devil loves confrontation the devil loves confusion the devil loves it when he has each one of us fighting against each other he loves it yeah he does but that's not what we're supposed to do that's not what we as christians are supposed to do amen look now saint john 21 20 then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loves following which also leaned on his breasts at suffering said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him say unto jesus lord and what shall this man do amen they already talked about judas's carrot he's already gone and done what he did but now peter sees this same disciple that was leaning on jesus breast following jesus and so peter goes to jesus and says lord what shall this man do the one that's following him what shall he do well first of all peter it's none of your business but this is what jesus said jesus sent unto him if i will that he tarried till i come what is that to thee follow thou me in other words that's a different way of saying peter it's none of your business you just follow me right you just keep your focus on me don't worry about what this man's doing don't worry about what this woman is doing don't worry about this person's walk with the lord of that person you just make sure your walk is right and that's the hardest thing that people seem to be able to do in this message they always want to fix somebody else right they always want to take control of somebody else's life their life is not your business their life is not your concern their life is not what god has put you in charge of right and that's what jesus is telling peter peter what is that to thee right amen what is it to thee if he tarry till i come and from that very same look what happened and then with this saying 23rd verse then with this saying abroad among the gen among the brethren that the disciples should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tear until i come what is that to thee so you see how it was misunderstood right you see how even what jesus said was misunderstood by the people listening to him and that statement went abroad it says that this disciple is not going to die but that is not what jesus said right that's not what jesus said what is it to you if he tarries till i come right all jesus is saying peter's done your business just tend to what you're supposed to be doing and that is following me amen amen the rest don't worry about it what is it to you so this but this saying went abroad the bible says that this disciple would not die could you imagine the churches ministering back then if that were to happen in a day like today oh brother so-and-so is not going to die did you hear brother so-and-so's dog of the night did you hear what jesus this this brother man said he's not going to die wow that's not what he said right and how many times do people see those things and read those things look the the we cannot figure it out with our natural minds brother adam said in the first seal you will never figure it out with your mind amen the the ministry is not is not to interpret the word but to rightly divide the word we as christians aren't to interpret the word we are to rightly divide the word there's a big difference yeah is to take the word and disseminate it properly according to the moving of the holy spirit yes by the will of god right so how easy is it then that things become misunderstood see a denomination starts a denomination starts when a man believes or a group of men believe that they can improve on what god has already done that's how you start a denomination they think they can improve on what god has already done what god has already brought we can make it better you can make it better than god you gotta you better stay in the channel that god's moving in or you're gonna get away from god and then you're out on your own yeah right amen you better stay in that channel friend you better stay on that channel brother or you're gonna get out from that channel if we're out in the channel the moving of god then you're in trouble there's a lot of voices in the land today friend but there's only one voice and that's the voice of jesus that is speaking through a many member body called the bride that is speaking to bring this bribe to a place of rapturing faith that we can leave this place that's the biggest and only doctrine i'm really concerned about amen amen i believe in the word i believe in the doctrine of the word the truth of the word and the revelation coming to us to bring us to that position because it's the word that changes us yeah it's not a gift it's not an interpretation it's not tongues and any of that is the word that brings you to a chain and if the word is not dressing you if the word is not changing you then something's wrong you're out of the channel of god amen people go home and i've heard it many times i've told you many of the meetings you've gone through man that wasn't that a great service man what he said was outstanding i said what was your favorite part well it was just all good i'm serious that that i'm not that's not something i'm giving off the cuff i've heard that yeah well what was your favorite part because i sat there and heard things i didn't agree with i said what did you like about it what did you hear him say what did you come out for well it was just all good that that was the common phrase oh it's just all good and i think these people are going home what are they going home with yeah what do they have that came across a pulpit of substance that they can apply to their lives that they can take home with them that they can live that they can let that word live through them through that next week or whatever what is it oh it was just good you can't tell me specifically what you really liked about the message amen coming down the road i asked my grandchildren what did you like the most about the trip they had specific answers right amen it's just that simple little children they have specific answers you go and ask a room full of adult what did you like oh it was just all good well we know that the whole trip was good we know that but what was your favorite part you know then that there's something askew there's something not the way it's supposed to be because that's not but that's but that's how people build their own kingdoms that's how denominations start amen misplace misrepresent dislocate the word amen and and it and it almost always brings a misunderstanding like this people misunderstand because of that and it gets broad it gets uh brought out all around the world broadcast everywhere brother so-and-so's not gonna die jesus said so that's not what he said look at some of these examples i got several i don't know if i'm gonna have time to read them all because you know me the time gets by so fast especially in the seals oh my around the seal time things that brother branham preached before and of course even in the seals and questions and answers on the seals i've got some here brother branham himself said in the field all it was was to reveal what had been what was now and what was coming right it was just opening up to those who could receive the revelation of it those who could receive the revelation of it would be revealed to them what it was what happened all the history of it bringing up into the day that we're living now even into the tribulation and into the new kingdom all of that it was all a part of it it was it was contained in those seals but look at the misunderstanding the misrepresentation now this is one of the most common ones and it is being propagated by people that should not be propagating is is being put forth by people it should not be put forth by i'll just put it that way i'm not calling names and then it's nobody in tucson or arizona but anyway so don't get that in your mind either i'll just say it's coming out of jeffersonville brother branham should evangelist continue on the field well there's a place in this country out of jeffersonville that says no no you should knock you shouldn't be any you should all be just listening to tapes that's all we should be doing listening to tapes well praise god you know what i do listen to him and i hope all of you do amen but when i go to church i want some live manna not that god can't bring what's on the tapes live to because he does but god put ministers in the pulpit to preach the gospel of the word amen it wasn't just on brother branham and brother branham let us know that hundreds of times right it wasn't just put on him amen but the question came forth in questions and answers on the seals should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course he says what do they mean by that in other words brother brandon said what do you even mean by asking that question should people keep should the evangelists keep preaching why would you even ask that right what do they even mean certainly by all means don't change a thing yeah amen amen if jesus is coming in the morning preach today like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this very hour don't get all scrupled up now that's why i'm trying to warn you about just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing be if you're doing something wrong or evil now repent of that and get right with god but continue on with your evangelistic service just as you've always done amen well that's enough for me amen if the question came to me well brother do you believe you should just play tapes in your church service that's enough for me right there that answers my question amen if you're building a house put it up if jesus comes tomorrow you'd be found faithful at the duty listen this is i love this it's gold to me because people get so misunderstood about this you could ask group people christians what if you knew jesus was coming tomorrow what would you do oh i'd do this super spiritual thing and i'd climb to the mountains or whatever i'd do this that and the other then you're wrong yeah you're wrong oh i hit the streets i'd do this well if that's what god's called you to do why aren't you doing it now right if that's what god's called you to do you should be doing that every day not just because you know jesus is coming tomorrow i believe that's one reason he said no man i know the day or the hour right amen he just wants to find those that are faithful to their post what's the post that god gave you what's the purpose god established in your life that's all god's looking for being faithful to that post being faithful to that responsibility he said if you're building a house and i knew jesus was coming tomorrow i'd build it anyway amen amen you'd be found faithful at the duty if you're building your church go on and put it up i'd rather be putting my money in something like that to be found within my pocket keep on continue as you are he said everybody understand continue on just as you are just don't stop nothing just keep going serve the lord now for instance if i was working for a man and you noted it was 15 minutes till quitting time you'd say well it's just 15 more minutes i'll just go over here and sit down say he is going to dock you for that 15 minutes because you didn't work you sit down doing nothing he said he's gonna dock you for that 15 minutes so uh if you're uh planting wheat plant your wheat you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out say well nobody will eat them but don't make a difference it's just like peter what about this guy don't worry about that it's not your business well nobody will eat them doesn't matter you just be found faithful at your post you just be found faithful working at what god has put in your life to do amen amen don't make no difference dig them out anyhow just continue as you are i got a letter from somebody the other day somebody told them said well the time's at hand sell the farm now you don't need no food to live off the farm because the millennium is going to start you won't need it so just go ahead while the tribulation is going on your children not saved let the children have the farm uh where they can eat off of it uh i said oh my if i if i know these coming tomorrow i was a farmer i put my crop in today if he would if he made me a farmer i was going to stay right at that duty he said now he gives a little joke he said somebody told me the other day he said i just bought a new car and i get the second set of keys to the pastor and told the pastor the rapture is about to happen so if i go into rapture here's the other set of keys you can have my card [Music] sorry but that he wouldn't be my pastor if i'll go that way but that's a little levity that brother brandon put in the story see um he said you say brother madam if he comes in the morning shouldn't you be out there no sir this is my post of duty i'll be standing right here preaching when he comes yeah saying the same things i am i'll just move on right out with them i hope if i'm holding potatoes i'll just keep holding amen look at this so you can see the misunderstanding people already thinking well should we quit evangelism no no no that that don't quit evangelism i'm so glad that we you know it was so it was so scrupled up before brother branham came and it's gotten so scrupled up again today yeah it's so many different doctrines that people just still believe brother adam was god two souls two gods uh christ came in 63 there's no more kind of the tent vision people say they preach and know what the tent vision is and we know for a fact brother brother greene told us in august of 65 brother branham still didn't even know what it meant right right three months before brother brown was taken off the scene he didn't know what it meant but every people i hear they seem to know where do you go with that you build another kingdom build another church build another masterpiece whatever whatever they've got just to to build something around a calling or or or uh some kind of a reputation see denomination that's all it is yes sir it's just people building denominations yeah you got no more blood on the mercy seat and and and i i just don't want to keep going it's just so many of them i got them all written down here i don't you know i could read them the ones that came to me off to you uh polygamy and uh joseph branham is god people have alters i've heard built in their brother brother green told me people have altars built in their homes to worship joseph brown just things that are just i i mean i know the the the text of this is misunderstood but that's gotten a bit beyond misunderstood i think it's sometimes right you start worshiping another man as god friend now you're you're treading on horrible you're you're treading on thin ice now jesus christ is god almighty and he is my savior and lord and that's it he used a man to bring a message to put that message on a tape so that i today could still listen and be fed by god amen from that word thank god it's on tape yes it is it's scrupled up bad enough the way it is could you imagine if the things he said wasn't on tape that we could listen to it for ourselves you imagine how scrupled up it really would be we got this to look at and say well people thought that you were supposed to quit preaching they still think that right brother branham's old son propagates that yeah it's not true misunderstood look at this another question is answers on the seals he said brother brown after you open the seals which brother adam did not open the seals jesus christ opened the seals right yes brother was just the man there at the time that god did it he says that himself you know that brother says i was just the one here when he decided to do it right yeah amen right i praise the lord i love it when it puts it in perspective right will this dispensation uh be of grace be over after you open the seals well brother brown says i hope not but he says no no friends don't you ever get that in your mind hallelujah don't ever get that in your mind and people have that in their minds today and you can listen on tape when brother random says don't ever think that i've heard ministers preach that the mercy of god was over yeah i've heard personally say that and i'm sure they probably do still say that brother brown says right here don't you ever do that right it just baffles me sometimes yes it's like and i hate to keep going back to this but it's like people sitting there in churches only playing tapes and if they would just play the right tape they could hear the man on the tape tell them to preach the gospel right am i right he'd tell him if you'd listen to the tapes that mechanical devices were not ordained to preach the gospel right yes men were ordained to preach the gospel amen again it's almost like a paradox it's we say we believe this but then you don't do what it says your actions are contrary to what he says right here people say oh i believe the message oh i'm deep into it i got these great revelations and you don't even obey this very statement right here right well brother brown says don't you ever think there's no mercy left now there will be a day when there's not right but the bride will be gone yes mine anyway that's what he says no no friends don't ever get that in your mind just go right on he says digging your potatoes again don't take that idea he said i ran across a man from north carolina here just the other day came up to me said glory to god can you tell me where some great somebody was i said no he said oh sir yes said this guy said it and it's the way today it maybe not in the message but charismatic realms uh they're always anyway uh let me just keep reading that he said no sir he said oh yes said this guy's got it he said he's this guy is the president of the auto mission what is the auto mission reven says the what the man says the auto mission brave man says i don't understand and he said all said this guy's the president i said what'd you say his name was he said branham i believe or something brown or branham he said well my name is brana he said are you the president of the auto mission he said no sir he said well where's the millennium at it's pardon me for laughing i shouldn't laugh because this is serious right but it really is the misunderstandings that people have sometimes we look at it and i've picked out some that probably seem a little silly to us but these people are sincere right they really believe this they really mean this they're sincere about this and he said well where's the millennium at brotherham says i don't know he said well what do you mean you you mean it it's it's going on right here and you don't even know it he said no sir i don't he said well glory to god said i've got some friends come and told me uh said i quit work and and i'm stealing my work clothes i just quit work and drove all the way up here he said brother i want the millennium brother and says well i believe you're just a little bit confused aren't you brother about that time carve drove up taxi cab he said hold it he said one little woman come up there now you're going to pray for my husband i said yes ma'am what about it she said well i understand that you have to wait a month on an interview to get prayed for now who said that yeah i don't know somebody must have said it but that wasn't brother branham's intention he said the brother graham says what she said yes sir said but i'm desperate you've got to come pray for my husband he says sure where's he at bring him on but you see how the misunderstanding oh if you you you want to see brother adam you got to wait at least a month but that's not brother branham's intention that wasn't what he meant probably wasn't what he said right but he gets broadcast all around right that this is the way it's gonna be well let me tell you friend god completely smashes and obliterates every one of our rules and traditions and regulations he does it the way he wants to whether we like it or not and he gets his point across in his time by his methods and i just want to be here as a mouthpiece to help be a part of it amen he said bring him on guy's standing in the lookout and says do you pray for the sick too he said yes sir he said what do you say your name was branham i said uh and you don't know nothing about the millennium well i now i don't understand it's just in the it's in the bible it says no it's it's right now people's come from everywhere i said where is it at he said jeffersonville indiana right under the bridge over here a bridge the underneath of a bridge in jeffersonville indiana is going to contain the millennium how many thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people are going to be in the millennium and yet it can be contained under pc you see how even the common natural mind and people can get caught up in so much of this stuff that it overtakes them it overcomes them yes amen and become very gullible about those things under a bridge in jeffersonville how could the millennium even be contained actually if you're under a bridge in indiana jeffersonville you're in the middle of the river and a millennium is going to take place under the bridge you've got the ends of the bridge where there's a little bit of land but that's it but this brother literally i mean he was excited the way brother branham tells the story he's oh he quit his job he quit his job and drove to indiana from north carolina so fast he didn't even change his work clothes wow met brother branham and said where is this irons in jeffersonville under a bridge i don't know brother i'm sorry but you see how people can be misunderstood right even from things that brother brown said so many times brother brown will make it so clear of things that he said i think a lot of times a lot of these things they either come from people who just want to be deceptive to build their own denomination or kingdom or they come from what they heard years ago without going back and bringing it to the to the tapes into the word and figuring out that that that's what to me that's what happened to the sunset mountain all the misunderstandings surrounding sunset now all the hundreds thousands whatever people has left a message because of the misunderstanding of the cloud and sunset mountains they just don't understand the facts if you take what he said on tape and you bring it out to understand what the truth of it is it's very simple it's not complicated yeah it really is and i don't have time to go into it today but if you have any question on that you can ask me his people there's people today still leaving this message because they think that cloud was created by rocket vandenberg air force base right and dr mcdonald the guy that brother greene personally talked to said that is impossible that that could have happened yeah he an atheist scientifically that that cloud could not have come from a rocket but yet people lead by the hunters from this message today because they think it was created right brother branham lied about it it's true he said brother there's another brother grandma i have some questions i'm gonna close here my i i've got two or three more i i better close i've heard people say now this is just questions and answers in 1964. i've heard people say that you have advised people well first of all the worst part of this statement is i have heard yes right right i've heard all kinds of things written but most of it's not true yeah in all facets of life work business home church i've heard all kinds of things i've heard people tell me all kinds of stuff a lot of us never even come to place uh to pass or never was even true right so the first part about it i have heard that's that's a tough one i have heard people say that you have advised them to sell all their homes and to follow you to arizona or they would not be in the rapture amen is this true amen he said that's a lie yeah or should we sell our houses or did you even say this no sir i did not say it if anything i've advised people not to do it he talked about the dream that junior jackson had where he had the mountain and and brother branham uh expressed everything that was on his heart to him and he cut the top of that mountain off took a crowbar looking thing and pried the top off the mountain and looked down in it was just white rock nothing written on him just white rock just pure white and brother and said you oh look on this while i go out and yonder and yet they all followed him well i shouldn't say all but many followed him but the vision that he interpreted said stay here and look on this well i i don't mean to interpret a dream brother brown didn't but i think it was the word purity of the word the message if you take it with the understanding that that god told him to store up the food at that place that that food would be stored up for the spiritual welfare of the coming generations then you'd understand that this this mountain would contain what what the truth was the revelation of the message the word for people to look on to listen to for god to reveal it to amen he said anything i've told people not to listen this now some understood you to say in your message future home of the bride and bridegroom and after have you heard that i've heard that i've heard that tape several times yes it's about four hours long but it's outstanding he said some saying the message that you said in the message future home of the bride bridegroom earthly bride there was to be 1500 miles from the tabernacle square 700 miles each way in other words the tabernacle sitting right in the middle would be 700 miles each way 1500 miles around is this true because i live outside of this area and should i move into that area misunderstanding no honey you don't he said you don't understand and if you've heard if you've heard of the tape that's not what brother brown is saying in fact brother later in the message goes on to say he believes it's going to be set over in palestine where abraham had had communion with melchizedek he said he believes that's going to be the con for lack of better phraseology the epicenter of where the mountain pyramid shaped mountain is going to press up out of the earth and the city's going to come down on it's over there not here he was just giving dimensions so that people could get and see how confusing how it's easily misunderstood he was simply giving dimensions so that people could visualize how big it was from maine to florida from the east coast to 700 miles i think it was west of mississippi something like that and he was just giving that as a dimensional view that people could mentally picture how big it's going to be or the bottom of it that's all he was doing but you see how misunderstandings come amen brother brown you have made statements recently concerning the church age has ended laodicea he said no i never said it's hindu amen he said did if if i did you misunderstood or i said it wrong this is the last church age is the end of the church ages of laodicea but laodicea has not ended in fact he says in several places at least a couple i know that that this layout to see an age will go into perdition yeah in fact even after the bride is gone it will still be a continuation of laodicea church yeah amen another one the church age ending and has blacked out the bride is called we have already entered into the tribulation period no no no and i've met people that believe that no no no i wish that i could have more time on that he says but people still believe it but you see how easily those things can be misunderstood in in saint john chapter four jesus has all these disciples all these men following him they saw the loaves and the fishes and and they went across the sea and they followed jesus right and they came up to jesus and he tried to explain to them who it was that he came for and the truth of the word and and and and and what god was doing for that day and and they they always reverted back to tradition and finally jesus just said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in me you have no life in you you have no part with me i mean and that's just a very descriptive hard saying and they said this is a hard thing who can take it and they left from him right because they had no revelation they had no understanding they followed him around but their desire in their heart was not the will of god right if it was god would have made known to them the truth of the world yes because he went to the others and said are you going to go also and they said where are we going to go you have the words of eternal life right that ended that what was that there was something different in them to want to continue on right and one of them was a devil amen amen it's the truth judas ended up selling selling jesus out right for the truth amen keep our balance keep your balance in the scripture loving your heart keep grace for one another so easy to try to put somebody out just because they disagree with us just because they disagree with you disagree with me discount them as a brother or sister we talked about this a little bit a couple of weeks ago discount as a brother or sister it seems so ironic that we try so hard to get people into the fold and into christ and into the truth when the truth of it is a lot of times people just want to get them in their church right because if you're not in if they're not in your church then they're not going right they're not worthy they're not my friend they're not my brother instead of thinking of getting them to jesus the thing is to give them to christ if you really desire to get them to christ that's all that matters amen and look if their doctrine is a little skewed friend if they are a child of god god will take care of that that's why jesus told peter what is that to you right amen love that person show them some mercy show them some grace expect even if they don't extend it to you right even if they don't extend that same mercy and grace that's not your responsibility right your responsibility is not what they do your responsibility is what you do what i do that's my responsibility if it's not reciprocated that's not my fault but that doesn't change who i am amen that doesn't change what i do or how i treat them you understand that body to try to be a help and a blessing that's what jesus did the only time jesus got angry in that context is when they were defiling the holy place right when they were defiling the temple he he ran he beat him out and that in that case amen and you say well they that probably offended them well you know and in that case they probably needed to be offended yes sir sometimes maybe that rattled their cage enough to come back to see the truth don't know right but the truth but but our position our responsibility is to be led of the spirit and as god leads you he will make known to you what the truth is what his word is and the truth of his word amen praise the lord i'm thankful i've known people i know one particular brother i'm closing here i know one particular brother and i still call him brother who left a certain doctor and he came and seemed like he was real centered he's really dug into the mess the truth and the word and and now i've heard he's just left the message all together just gone back into the nomination world i still he's still my brother but uh and this is on the east coast but it i thought it was important that i meet that brother at the time that i met it i don't i didn't know that at the time i know it now this is how i feel about it to understand the complexities of of all those things that come into a person's life and what they believe and what they don't believe and what they accept and don't accept and what they hear and what they the things that they hear that they accept and you know there's a lot of voices out there friend you can't believe everything you hear amen but i tell you what i know one thing god vindicated sent and vindicated a word prophet for this last day to bring a message to clothe a bride to get her ready for rapture amen that i do know yes amen yes and that word which is christ i stand behind and with 100 amen amen praise the lord let's stand if we could some of these misunderstandings may have sound silly they may have sound like how could a person ever get caught up in something like that how could a person ever believe something like that but it happens yes it happens a lot there may have been times in your life where there was things that seemed to you now as why or how could i've ever felt that way how could i've ever seen that or thought that way but god always has a way of bringing that around yes amen and showing you that truth and revealing that word to you man yes and see and and then aren't you glad if maybe you were off a little bit of the people that showed you a little kindness right yes and a little grace a little mercy love amen we all have a past we've all done things wrong we've all made our mistakes amen but the most important thing is at this point in life if never before this moment this day this time in life my desire is to do nothing but the will of god amen and be found faithful at that post amen yes when he comes if we're still here and when he comes amen be faithful at that post praise the lord amen let's sing this little course number 423 or 424 excuse me

you found me you set me free amen i'm so glad i belong to him i'm so glad i'm his because i'm his amen and i can continue to press this battle in faith and rest and peace amen knowing that he'll lead the way right yes if he leads the way and i'm following him it'll all end up in the right place amen praise the lord jesus god bless you today pray something was said to bless and strengthen you the
