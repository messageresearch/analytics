[24:48] if i was on his mind before the
[24:49] foundation of the world if i was part of
[24:51] him before the foundation of the world
[24:53] that didn't change because he went to
[24:54] calvary

[25:22] to mention
[25:24] um
[25:25] remember the
[25:27] this morning brother
[25:29] shariah had texted me said art woke up
[25:31] early this morning and um about three
[25:33] o'clock
[25:35] and was throwing up so you want to
[25:38] remember art and prayer and also
[25:40] she said
[25:41] gaber wasn't feeling well so let's
[25:43] remember uh art and gabriel this morning
[25:45] the viastero's family also
[25:49] um
[25:50] i got a call
[25:51] kind of a surprise call but i got a call
[25:54] friday morning from brother dan suthert
[25:56] if anybody knows brother dan
[25:58] souther i don't really know him very
[25:59] well but i talked to him a couple years
[26:01] ago when we're over on cortero and
[26:04] um we talked for a while and
[26:06] he just had some struggles and some
[26:08] things he wanted to talk over i don't
[26:10] think he ever actually came to the
[26:11] church
[26:15] but
[26:17] talking to him on the phone he's a
[26:18] precious brother used to go to the
[26:19] tabernacle so
[26:21] so you remember brother dan okay praise
[26:23] the lord um well his son passed away
[26:26] friday morning oh snow
[26:28] he was
[26:29] in his 40s he was a police officer
[26:32] on the on the tpd
[26:35] a police force for 17 15 or 17 years i
[26:38] forget what it was now
[26:40] um he'd gone through the whole thing of
[26:43] being a police officer and being a first
[26:45] responder and uh you know servicing our
[26:48] community and uh here just recently
[26:51] caught cobit and
[26:52] uh they took him to that place on
[26:54] cortero and they didn't have any beds in
[26:56] any other hospitals and
[26:58] uh i don't know for him but it just
[27:00] didn't sound like they treated the man
[27:01] very well especially for someone who had
[27:03] given
[27:04] basically his life to service in this
[27:06] community in this uh this city uh they
[27:09] never put him in a regular hospital um
[27:12] but anyway
[27:14] the resulting
[27:16] uh fact is that he passed away
[27:19] friday morning so please remember
[27:20] brother dan and his wife in prayer
[27:23] if you would the passing of their son
[27:27] i just it kind of
[27:29] it's kind of getting on me again i'm
[27:30] trying not to let it but it kind of got
[27:32] all over me friday when i was talking to
[27:34] him and found out the whole details and
[27:36] everything it just it really bothered me
[27:38] uh
[27:39] there really should have been been no
[27:41] reason for this man to have passed away
[27:43] in my opinion but
[27:44] again as i say i'm not gonna i'm not
[27:47] gonna give credence to the devil i'm not
[27:49] gonna give place to the devil if he was
[27:51] a man of god and he was a son of god and
[27:53] it was his time to go i'm just believing
[27:55] the lord took him for a reason whatever
[27:58] that might be but
[27:59] the natural circumstances kind of make
[28:01] me upset uh i think they should treat
[28:04] you say i
[28:05] i i'm not showing respect for a person
[28:08] here friend and you know he deserved a
[28:10] better bet over someone else but you
[28:12] know when someone gives 15 17 years of
[28:15] their life uh protecting our community
[28:17] and servicing our community and first
[28:19] responder and uh
[28:21] you know they should find him a bed
[28:24] a hospital bed in tucson arizona for him
[28:27] to go to
[28:28] and get some treatment but uh sometimes
[28:31] their treatments aren't all that great
[28:33] anyway so but
[28:35] uh please the whole point though is
[28:37] please remember brother dan i know all
[28:39] of us except for maybe brother pat
[28:40] doesn't know him uh to know him but uh
[28:43] please pray for him his wife
[28:46] um
[28:47] uh he just called me said i don't know
[28:49] what i'm gonna do now and i
[28:51] said well brother we're here if you need
[28:52] anything at all if there's anything at
[28:54] all we can do please let us know
[29:02] he lives about two blocks from me
[29:04] and that son right there we went to
[29:06] school with my
[29:08] son lee
[29:09] and they graduated together and uh
[29:13] his wife is sister pat and she sat right
[29:16] in front of us at tucson tabernacle
[29:18] every week sometimes on the same road
[29:20] my mind two sister passed together but
[29:23] anyway he has a breathing
[29:27] problem and he can't go to church
[29:29] brother dan and he can't go to church va
[29:31] told me he had some issues and
[29:33] incontinence and things like that but
[29:35] his wife sister pat was always there in
[29:38] tucson tabernacle
[29:41] my mind let's please remember to make a
[29:43] wooden prayer i don't know if we'll see
[29:45] him here he asked where we were now so
[29:48] but uh just trust the lord would visit
[29:50] with them most of all
[29:52] amen he said they're supposed to have an
[29:54] honor guard for him and uh he's supposed
[29:56] to be interned at east lawn so
[29:58] uh if i get any details i'll certainly
[30:00] let you know about that
[30:02] i also got a prayer request from sister
[30:04] julie sees please continue to remember

[51:06] last night i was at
[51:09] sprouts
[51:10] and
[51:11] i was got in my water and i wasn't ready
[51:14] to get in line i was just standing there
[51:17] and the checker
[51:19] was helping other people and and i was
[51:21] like 20 feet from her and all of a
[51:24] sudden she she says oh you need
[51:26] something
[51:27] and i said well i just got water
[51:29] and she said and and she was
[51:33] it's it's very
[51:35] she said well you have to get in line
[51:38] and it just didn't settle with me and i
[51:40] got angry and i just flared out and i
[51:42] said no i don't have to stand in line i
[51:45] mean there was an anger that came out
[51:48] and i and i went man i don't get angry
[51:51] i just don't
[51:53] and and that just flared out and i
[51:55] thought you know
[51:57] and it bothered me all night long and
[51:59] everything i woke up this morning and i
[52:02] i was still bothering me i was still
[52:04] angry and and i said lord what you know
[52:07] this is
[52:08] you know help me through this this this
[52:10] doesn't feel right
[52:12] and um the lord showed me you know
[52:15] uh that i you know we we don't
[52:18] always see people's intentions i felt
[52:21] that she was
[52:22] officious and and many other things
[52:26] and um and talking down to me and and so
[52:29] forth you know and you know i realized
[52:31] that's just the devil
[52:33] trying to upset my peace that's in the
[52:37] lord because i'm looking at things god's
[52:40] way and he's trying to get me to look at
[52:42] it satan's way and trying to get me to
[52:45] put thoughts that she might be thinking
[52:48] that she might be feeling and which is
[52:51] just a whole lot of nonsense
[52:53] and god just showed me you know
[52:56] that
[52:57] because i was making it all up i could
[53:00] for you know that i was accepting the
[53:01] devil's thoughts i could forgive her and
[53:03] i just you know and so i wrote her a
[53:06] letter
[53:07] because i complained to the head cashier
[53:09] and everything i mean i was i was wrong
[53:13] i was wrong and i just you know this
[53:16] song just really brought it out
[53:18] that you know he's you know
[53:21] that we you know we have to you know
[53:25] i'm just going to leave it at that
[53:27] we're just not all that we're we if
[53:30] we're not
[53:31] walking with god
[53:33] we're wrong and we're not walking in
[53:36] that peace
[53:37] in that peace
[53:38] we're wrong amen
[53:40] amen and we're still in these sticky
[53:43] flesh right yes and make mistakes and
[53:45] things we shouldn't do and say
[53:48] emotions flare up sometimes amen
[53:51] it's good when they calm down and
[53:52] they'll recognize it and the lord
[53:54] touches you
[53:55] amen you make it right
[53:58] did you just worship me or did you have
[54:00] to oh no i i just i have a testimony of
[54:05] what you said
[54:06] quite a while ago
[54:08] about you worked 117
[54:11] degrees and you were with a pig outside
[54:15] and you said i did this in the name of
[54:16] the lord amen
[54:18] you don't know how much i changed my
[54:20] life
[54:22] sometimes i start complaining you know
[54:25] i'm doing housework i'm doing this and
[54:27] i'm running and
[54:30] i start thanking god
[54:31] and i said no i'm not going to complain
[54:34] thank you jesus i do this in the name of
[54:36] the lord jesus christ
[54:37] well that changes your attitude praise
[54:40] the lord
[54:42] changed mine at which i needed it
[54:45] but i give
[54:51] see sometimes god you all understand is
[54:53] it was a lesson to me first
[54:56] and then it turned into a message
[54:58] so
[54:59] uh
[55:00] a lot of times it comes to me first and
[55:03] corrects my spirit a lot of times and
[55:06] then it goes from there so
[55:09] trust me i understand it's it's easy i
[55:11] guess to have that when you're
[55:14] but i thank god i have the strength to
[55:16] do it yes amen thank god he gives me the
[55:19] ability and the strength and
[55:20] uh to be able to do it so praise the
[55:23] lord so in jesus name
[55:25] praise the lord
[55:26] amen we uh tried something a little bit
[55:29] different uh before we get to the word
[55:31] hero i meant to mention that we tried a
[55:33] little something a little different uh
[55:35] me and micah and zach had a little
[55:37] brainstorm last sunday night about
[55:39] trying to fix this uh
[55:41] streaming issue and uh because the the
[55:44] router is
[55:45] way over in the two-story building i'm
[55:47] sure i didn't ask where it is so uh for
[55:51] the signal even even though it was a
[55:53] better signal for it to go from the
[55:55] camera
[55:56] to the router back to his computer and
[56:00] then back up through the router to
[56:02] stream it out
[56:03] was just it just too far it's just too
[56:06] much and it just comes to the reality
[56:08] unless there's a router right here it
[56:10] just wasn't going to work like that so
[56:12] zach bought up a
[56:14] usb cable that we could run so when you
[56:16] see the cable here we just try to
[56:18] hardwire it so that way only his
[56:20] computer has to be attached to the
[56:22] router or has to have internet because
[56:24] then it comes from the the camera
[56:26] hardwired into there and then up so we
[56:29] don't have to we cut out one length of
[56:31] that and we tested it yesterday and it
[56:33] seemed to be doing better stride text me
[56:36] said there's a little static in the
[56:38] live feed so i'm not sure what that is
[56:40] but i'm going to get a an addition to
[56:42] that chord because that's not quite long
[56:44] enough to make it look a little bit
[56:46] better but so if you see the chord you
[56:47] understand we're just trying to hardwire
[56:50] it so we don't have
[56:52] hopefully correcting that issue so
[56:54] uh just pray for us we keep
[56:56] seeing whatever the lord shows us and
[56:58] helps us with to be able to do and fix
[57:00] it to make it work right and for those
[57:02] for some reason aren't able to come and
[57:04] need to stream or something uh the
[57:05] abilities there so i guess it's worked
[57:08] okay this morning
[57:12] loud audio is for making static
[57:14] so
[57:15] hopefully the stream is good
[57:17] so and and not hit copy and not
[57:21] that thing that was going through it i
[57:23] don't know if you ever watched or
[57:24] watched the re-watch the services and so
[57:28] we're just trying to get rid of all that
[57:29] so it's good
[57:31] and so when you see that you understand
[57:34] that's what we're doing that's what's
[57:35] going on so trusting this is going to
[57:37] work this works and praise the lord
[57:40] it'll be good amen so
[57:42] let's stand to our feet if we could uh
[57:44] we'll go into the scriptures now saint
[57:46] john chapter three
[57:53] and then saint john chapter 3 where
[57:54] we're going to begin our scripture
[57:56] reading
[57:59] miss brother tom sister karen
[58:02] you know i like seeing brother tom
[58:05] and with us and tommy and elizabeth in
[58:08] your family so
[58:10] remember thankful
[58:12] you've been thankful to have each one
[58:13] here this
[58:14] uh this morning i'm sure hopefully one
[58:16] day brother charlie will be able to come
[58:18] join us
[58:20] come
[58:22] praise the lord wonderful that'd be
[58:24] great

[59:49] you would get the glory and the praise
[59:51] for all that is said and done
[59:53] take your word lord now and bring it
[59:55] forth fresh to us reveal it to us and
[59:57] help us see and hear what you'd have us
[59:59] to know to be encouragement and help to
[1:00:01] us along the way we thank you for those
[1:00:03] that have come those who are streaming
[1:00:05] today bless them exceedingly lord god
[1:00:08] bless remaining part of this service
[1:00:09] lord and speak to us now once again
[1:00:12] through these lips hear through the ears
[1:00:15] of your people as we give you glory and
[1:00:17] praise honor for all that is uh for all
[1:00:20] that is said and done in jesus christ's
[1:00:22] name amen amen amen saint john chapter 3
[1:00:26] verse 13.
[1:00:30] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[1:00:32] but he that come down from heaven
[1:00:35] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:00:37] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[1:00:40] the wilderness even so must the son of
[1:00:42] man be lifted up that whosoever
[1:00:44] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:00:47] have eternal life
[1:00:49] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:00:51] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:00:53] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:00:55] have everlasting life
[1:00:57] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:01:00] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:01:02] through him might be saved
[1:01:04] he that believeth on him is not
[1:01:06] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:01:08] condemned already because he hath not
[1:01:11] believed in the name of the only
[1:01:12] begotten son of god and this is the
[1:01:16] condemnation that light has come into
[1:01:18] the world and men loved darkness rather
[1:01:20] than light because their deeds were evil
[1:01:24] for every one that doeth evil hateth the
[1:01:26] light neither cometh to light lest his
[1:01:29] deeds should be reproved
[1:01:30] but he that doeth truth cometh to light
[1:01:33] that his deeds may be made manifest that
[1:01:36] they are wrought in god you could be
[1:01:38] seated if you like
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:42] i want to take a little subject uh maybe
[1:01:45] for the next few services of who am i
[1:01:47] amen kind of goes along with the song
[1:01:50] that we had there who i am
[1:01:52] uh who am i it's something that people
[1:01:55] of the world christians even people who
[1:01:58] call themselves godly people people that
[1:02:00] say they're in the message people that
[1:02:02] say they're born again hop for on a
[1:02:04] daily basis to try to find who they are
[1:02:08] where they fit where they belong what
[1:02:10] their placement is why god put them here
[1:02:14] what is the reason for my existence
[1:02:17] and i i believe as a child of god that
[1:02:20] we come to the understanding of the
[1:02:22] point why we are here why god put us
[1:02:24] here the whole point of why god called
[1:02:27] us in this flesh and why god put us in
[1:02:30] this place
[1:02:31] uh it's
[1:02:33] uh it's a great question that that i
[1:02:35] think plagues a lot of people but i
[1:02:37] think for a christian there's a very
[1:02:40] simple explanation and that is that we
[1:02:43] are predestinated by god to be here god
[1:02:46] foreknew us here god predestinated
[1:02:49] that plan for us because he foreknew us
[1:02:53] that we would be in this place this time
[1:02:55] and the purpose that we would serve and
[1:02:57] the reason that we would have us here
[1:02:59] and what all any of us would do i've had
[1:03:02] several people uh come to me and tell me
[1:03:04] you know brother you i don't really know
[1:03:06] what i'm supposed to be doing
[1:03:08] i i don't really know why i'm here i
[1:03:10] don't really know what my calling is i
[1:03:12] don't really know uh what what gifts i
[1:03:15] might possess or what gifts fall
[1:03:17] uh in my purview or or that god has
[1:03:21] given me i i don't understand i just
[1:03:23] don't know i'm just not sure michael
[1:03:24] will you turn the hair down or not i see
[1:03:26] a lot of sweaters going on uh i just
[1:03:29] don't know and i've had a lot of people
[1:03:31] ask me that i've had a lot of people uh
[1:03:34] not sure and and misunderstood and
[1:03:37] misunderstanding
[1:03:38] and i think a lot of times the problem
[1:03:40] comes from people who don't know who
[1:03:43] they are to start with
[1:03:45] you've got to first know who you are
[1:03:48] before you can even start getting to the
[1:03:50] place that you're in that position of
[1:03:53] adoption if you will or that placement
[1:03:55] or your understanding of that placement
[1:03:58] who you are why you're here what purpose
[1:04:00] you're supposed to serve and what and
[1:04:02] what gift you have and it's amazing
[1:04:04] because sometimes the and of course a
[1:04:06] lot of the visions clouded by the devil
[1:04:08] and uh the devil's easy uh very good at
[1:04:11] being able to cloud all the vision of
[1:04:12] people that they don't realize and see
[1:04:15] in themselves what others sometimes see
[1:04:18] in them uh i've had people come and and
[1:04:21] ask me well you know i don't i don't
[1:04:22] know what what one of those gifts of the
[1:04:24] spirit that i that i possess that i'm
[1:04:27] supposed to manifest i've never spoken
[1:04:29] tongues or prophesied so on so forth and
[1:04:31] i said well brother
[1:04:33] i know that's real easy
[1:04:36] not calling a person's name or even the
[1:04:38] gift i said but from my perspective and
[1:04:41] knowing you like i have this is what
[1:04:43] god's called you to do this is exactly
[1:04:45] in the scripture but see he couldn't see
[1:04:47] it he didn't see it for himself he just
[1:04:50] thought well they just does this that
[1:04:51] the other and whatever
[1:04:53] along and it's just part of life no it's
[1:04:55] not
[1:04:56] it's a part of life because that's what
[1:04:58] god's called you to do it's a part of
[1:05:00] your life because that's what god's put
[1:05:02] in your life to do
[1:05:03] it's your life and that's who
[1:05:05] god is working himself through you to to
[1:05:08] fulfill this gift to operate this gift
[1:05:11] now it may not be something that's out
[1:05:13] in front or something that people notice
[1:05:15] or see or or something like that but it
[1:05:18] that's irrelevant in the economy of god
[1:05:21] it's irrelevant
[1:05:23] of the stature of the gift or the
[1:05:25] position of the gift or or if it's done
[1:05:27] in private or if it's done just in a
[1:05:30] secluded way or if it's out for the
[1:05:32] whole congregation to be a part of
[1:05:34] doesn't matter in the economy of god
[1:05:36] every bit of it is as important as the
[1:05:39] rest yes amen and i said you've got to
[1:05:41] take it at that yes and he started
[1:05:44] thinking about it and he started well
[1:05:45] you know that's
[1:05:46] i see that now if that makes sense i can
[1:05:49] understand that that that that would be
[1:05:51] a part of the gift and but he just threw
[1:05:54] it off as just just a way of life it's
[1:05:56] just it's just what i do well you do it
[1:05:58] because that's the holy ghost and you
[1:06:00] working through here to do it yes
[1:06:02] but it took that for him to understand
[1:06:04] that's what god was doing for him that
[1:06:07] was god the spirit of god working in his
[1:06:09] life
[1:06:10] and a lot of people miss that how easy
[1:06:12] it is the devil clouds the vision to
[1:06:14] work you just don't recognize it other
[1:06:17] people look and say well my i see that
[1:06:19] plane as dave but they can't see it
[1:06:21] themselves
[1:06:23] maybe i don't know humility modesty i
[1:06:24] don't know but they can't see it
[1:06:26] themselves but there's there's there's
[1:06:28] nothing that
[1:06:30] that comes in a person of christian's
[1:06:32] life that
[1:06:34] that
[1:06:34] that you say well you know i'm just i'm
[1:06:37] just humble about this gift or you know
[1:06:39] i'm just contrite about about this thing
[1:06:42] and the acknowledgement of it and uh you
[1:06:44] know i i this is the third church i've
[1:06:47] pastored i've been ministering over 33
[1:06:49] years and it's still every time i hear
[1:06:52] the word pastor referencing to me is
[1:06:55] still strange
[1:06:56] it is
[1:06:58] uh it just is i
[1:07:00] but
[1:07:02] when god calls you to do something you
[1:07:04] do it right but it's something that's
[1:07:06] that that's out there to the point that
[1:07:08] it's understandable it's acknowledged
[1:07:11] it's recognized but it's still to me
[1:07:13] it's like it's just strange to hear
[1:07:16] sometimes i appreciate it and i thank
[1:07:19] god for it uh
[1:07:20] but it's all him yeah everybody it's all
[1:07:23] humans it's that none of us could do
[1:07:25] anything or be anything if it wasn't for
[1:07:27] him so that's the whole point but we
[1:07:29] acknowledge that and we thank god for it
[1:07:31] so the part of understanding who i am
[1:07:35] uh who am i lord who am i
[1:07:38] uh first of all we start with the
[1:07:40] fundamental foundation here in this
[1:07:42] scripture we find one of the most simple
[1:07:45] scriptures i probably is a as a good
[1:07:47] baptist growing up this is the first
[1:07:49] scripture i ever learned that i could
[1:07:51] pull from for from heart for god so
[1:07:54] loved the world he gave his only
[1:07:55] begotten son the whosoever believeth in
[1:07:57] him shall not perish but have
[1:07:59] everlasting life that's the first
[1:08:00] scripture i can quote verbatim uh
[1:08:04] as a good baptist boy be able to
[1:08:06] uh quote
[1:08:08] that scripture but that scripture has
[1:08:12] now
[1:08:12] uh as an ornament has a lot of value to
[1:08:15] it that sometimes maybe me as a little
[1:08:17] baptist boy didn't understand and of
[1:08:19] course the scripture before that
[1:08:22] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:08:25] perish but have eternal life now
[1:08:30] there's a lot of messages you can get to
[1:08:32] about the condemnation and the darkness
[1:08:34] and the light of course and concerning
[1:08:36] with what's going on in the world today
[1:08:38] and people who would rather be in the
[1:08:39] darkness rather than the light
[1:08:42] you see most of the time when people go
[1:08:44] out to quote unquote party it's after it
[1:08:46] gets dark
[1:08:47] there's a reason for that
[1:08:50] people would rather be in the dark
[1:08:51] because their their evil deeds are
[1:08:53] exposed when they're in the light
[1:08:55] you know and sometimes that light to
[1:08:57] some people that light shines so bright
[1:09:00] they still can't see what's on the other
[1:09:02] side
[1:09:03] they still can't see because the light
[1:09:04] is so bright to them right but
[1:09:07] so they'd rather have the darkness the
[1:09:09] darkness the light exposes them
[1:09:12] but let's take uh uh for for sake of our
[1:09:16] our subject here the 15th
[1:09:18] verse whosoever believeth in him should
[1:09:22] not perish but have eternal life
[1:09:25] now let's start there eternal life what
[1:09:27] does it mean to have eternal life what
[1:09:30] is eternal life who has eternal life
[1:09:33] amen uh
[1:09:35] newton bennett does not have eternal
[1:09:36] life
[1:09:38] who does have eternal life who is
[1:09:41] eternal because there's only one that is
[1:09:44] eternal
[1:09:45] that is god
[1:09:47] me and you are not eternal
[1:09:49] not in ourselves
[1:09:50] you look at this this begotten son
[1:09:54] i i am not eternal
[1:09:56] but there's a part of me that's down on
[1:09:59] the inside that is eternal
[1:10:01] and that's the part of me who he is amen
[1:10:04] so to break down and understand the
[1:10:07] eternal part and to recognize there's a
[1:10:10] part of you
[1:10:12] forget about your flesh even your spirit
[1:10:15] down into the soul where there's an
[1:10:17] eternal part
[1:10:19] that never had a beginning and will
[1:10:21] never have an end
[1:10:23] that part that's of you is really who
[1:10:27] you are
[1:10:28] this is just a shell that we've been
[1:10:30] housed in to live upon this earth to
[1:10:32] fulfill the purpose of whatever god's
[1:10:34] called us to do in this life
[1:10:36] that's just all this shells for the
[1:10:38] spirit comes with it to give the body
[1:10:40] life
[1:10:41] and of course we got imagination
[1:10:43] constant affection reason memory that's
[1:10:45] the part of the spirit but the spirit's
[1:10:46] there to get the body of life
[1:10:48] so the thing that really matters is that
[1:10:51] part that's on the inside the eternal
[1:10:53] part to recognize what that eternal part
[1:10:56] is
[1:10:57] amen and that and that it is eternal
[1:11:00] that it never had a beginning and it
[1:11:02] never will have an end
[1:11:04] amen let's go to galatians now chapter
[1:11:07] four
[1:11:14] as we work on
[1:11:16] and examining that that eternal
[1:11:19] eternity being eternal
[1:11:22] a lot of
[1:11:23] a lot of
[1:11:24] tiny people get a misconception
[1:11:28] that they say i'm eternal
[1:11:31] but there's only one eternal that's god
[1:11:34] so the only way that you
[1:11:37] i'll just say you in reference because
[1:11:39] we're digging down deep into the soul of
[1:11:41] man now not your flesh spirit
[1:11:43] the only part that's eternal
[1:11:46] is that is is god's
[1:11:50] if you came from god
[1:11:52] and you're going back to god
[1:11:55] that's who you really are amen yes yes
[1:11:59] this is just a house amen put a name on
[1:12:02] it
[1:12:03] put a spirit in it it's just a house
[1:12:06] but that part that's really you came
[1:12:09] from god
[1:12:10] came out of god
[1:12:12] it's a part of god
[1:12:14] you can chop my pinky off and stick it
[1:12:16] on somebody else but it's still my pinky
[1:12:20] a person can get a heart transplant and
[1:12:23] take the heart out of a person who's
[1:12:24] dying and put it in someone who can use
[1:12:26] it but that heart's still mine
[1:12:29] it was my heart
[1:12:31] it becomes theirs they can use it for
[1:12:33] the time and period that's allotted for
[1:12:35] them but it was my heart amen
[1:12:38] this pinky will always be mine
[1:12:41] you can take it off and put it on
[1:12:43] somebody else but it's always mine right
[1:12:46] that that came from god is always god's
[1:12:51] god didn't take part of himself out of
[1:12:53] himself
[1:12:55] to be dismissed and done away with
[1:12:58] no it's if it's a part of him then it's
[1:13:01] a part of him now
[1:13:03] it will always be a part of him
[1:13:06] that's why we use the phrase came from
[1:13:09] god going back to god
[1:13:12] we don't go back to god just as a
[1:13:14] fellowship we go back to god because
[1:13:17] we're a part of god
[1:13:19] that part of god who we are
[1:13:22] amen not this begotten part but that
[1:13:24] part that was predestined before the
[1:13:27] foundation of the world
[1:13:29] galatians chapter 4 verse one
[1:13:32] now i'm i'm i'm gonna try to get to
[1:13:34] something a little bit later
[1:13:36] that a lot of people consider kind of
[1:13:38] controversial but
[1:13:40] uh it's a quote that brother branham
[1:13:42] made but
[1:13:43] uh i believe if you examine in the
[1:13:46] scripture which we're going to do and
[1:13:48] you place it properly where it belongs
[1:13:50] in the scripture it's absolutely the
[1:13:53] gospel
[1:13:54] of truth
[1:13:56] but now galatians 4 we're working to
[1:13:58] that point galatians 4 verse 1
[1:14:01] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[1:14:04] a child
[1:14:05] different nothing from a servant though
[1:14:08] he be lord of all
[1:14:10] but is under tutors and governors until
[1:14:13] the time appointed or that dispensation
[1:14:15] of the time that was set by the father
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:20] even so we when we were children were in
[1:14:23] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:14:26] we were in bondage which means
[1:14:28] and the word were means that we are no
[1:14:31] longer under the bondage of the elements
[1:14:35] of the world
[1:14:36] you understand that
[1:14:37] what does that mean to you then when you
[1:14:39] talk about
[1:14:41] sickness or disease or afflictions or
[1:14:43] coping
[1:14:45] what does that mean
[1:14:46] it means i'm no longer bound under those
[1:14:48] elements those elements don't hold me
[1:14:51] captive no matter what it is those
[1:14:53] things of the world do no longer hold me
[1:14:56] captive they were
[1:14:58] things that held me in bondage they were
[1:15:01] things that kept me captive but no
[1:15:03] longer
[1:15:08] but when the time but when the fullness
[1:15:11] of the time was come god sent forth his
[1:15:13] son
[1:15:14] made of a woman made under the law
[1:15:17] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:15:20] that he might receive the adoption of
[1:15:23] sons be placed
[1:15:25] put in the placement as a son now
[1:15:27] remember we went through
[1:15:30] well a whole year on adoption
[1:15:33] uh forgot how many parts over 30 parts a
[1:15:35] whole year on adoption we went through
[1:15:37] that adoption
[1:15:39] and the fundamental foundation of that
[1:15:41] adoption was to understand the adoption
[1:15:44] is not so much relationship as it is
[1:15:47] placement
[1:15:49] when we think of adoption in this world
[1:15:51] we think of relationship
[1:15:54] that person was somebody else's they
[1:15:57] died or gave up their child and so i
[1:15:59] accept that child's as an adoptive
[1:16:02] process to become my child
[1:16:05] thus it becomes relationship they're now
[1:16:08] my son or daughter they no longer are
[1:16:10] their son or daughter they're my son or
[1:16:12] daughter that's relationship
[1:16:15] amen now there's a placement to it
[1:16:18] because of the placement of them used to
[1:16:20] be uh a jones and now they're a smith
[1:16:24] now that's a placement that's not
[1:16:26] relationship that's placement now
[1:16:29] because you were this but now you're
[1:16:31] that you were smith now you're jones
[1:16:34] that's placement but your jones as in
[1:16:37] relationship to son or daughter
[1:16:40] or sister or brother or niece or nephew
[1:16:42] whatever it is that's relationship but
[1:16:45] in the economy of god it's about
[1:16:48] placement
[1:16:49] not relationship there's not a question
[1:16:53] to whether or not you are a son or
[1:16:54] daughter of god that's not the question
[1:16:57] never was the question
[1:16:59] because if you ever are or ever going to
[1:17:02] be a son or daughter of god you always
[1:17:05] work
[1:17:06] right now
[1:17:07] you never we're not it's just like the
[1:17:10] prodigal son
[1:17:11] when the prodigal son came back and the
[1:17:14] father threw a feast and the other
[1:17:16] brother got mad
[1:17:18] because the other brother's like well
[1:17:20] wait dad i've been here this whole time
[1:17:22] i've served you faithfully i've done
[1:17:24] this i've done that and he said why are
[1:17:26] you so mad the half of your
[1:17:28] my kingdom is yours
[1:17:30] my kingdom belongs to you what are you
[1:17:33] mad about
[1:17:34] but you gotta understand son that your
[1:17:36] brother has come home
[1:17:39] he was lost
[1:17:41] he was out in the world he was dying
[1:17:43] with no hope but now he's come back home
[1:17:48] and i received him into my home why
[1:17:52] because he's my son
[1:17:55] when he left me
[1:17:56] when he was in the world when his face
[1:17:59] was smacked down in the middle of the
[1:18:01] pig trough he was still my son
[1:18:04] he was never not a son pardon the double
[1:18:07] negative but he was never not a son he
[1:18:10] was always a son
[1:18:12] he didn't stop being a son at any point
[1:18:15] in time
[1:18:16] from birth till now he's always been
[1:18:18] always will be amen amen he's the son
[1:18:23] that's the same thing for us if we're a
[1:18:25] son if we're a daughter we always work
[1:18:28] we never became we just always work
[1:18:32] but when we're
[1:18:33] children we sit under tutors governors
[1:18:36] you know we go about our lives and do
[1:18:38] our things and live our lives but when
[1:18:40] the time came
[1:18:42] when the fullness of that dispensation
[1:18:44] of your life came
[1:18:46] and that fullness reached this ebb it
[1:18:49] came to a place to where you recognized
[1:18:52] who you really were and that word and
[1:18:55] that voice spoke to you and you
[1:18:58] recognized it and you received it and
[1:19:00] you accepted it as your own
[1:19:02] amen amen that's your recognition
[1:19:06] that hey i i belong to this family
[1:19:10] you know there was a time
[1:19:12] when you're born you don't realize i
[1:19:14] didn't realize when i was born i was a
[1:19:16] bennett
[1:19:17] how did you know that
[1:19:19] i had no idea
[1:19:20] i was just a baby goo gaga give me some
[1:19:22] more milk that's all i knew
[1:19:25] you know when you're a little child
[1:19:26] that's that's all they do
[1:19:28] they
[1:19:28] they drink milk and they poop that's
[1:19:31] that's their whole kid's life they eat
[1:19:32] poop eat
[1:19:34] that's all they do yeah i didn't know it
[1:19:36] was a bennett
[1:19:37] but there came a time
[1:19:39] in my relationship with my family that i
[1:19:42] recognized who my mama and daddy were
[1:19:45] right i knew it on the inside because of
[1:19:48] the nurturing that they gave me
[1:19:50] but i didn't realize i belonged to the
[1:19:53] bennett family i didn't know that
[1:19:55] but when it came a time when that
[1:19:58] dispensation
[1:19:59] reached its end its fullness i
[1:20:02] recognized i'm abundant
[1:20:05] i recognize that when the spirit world
[1:20:08] friend you reach the same place
[1:20:10] you come to the place you walk out the
[1:20:11] world you do all these things but there
[1:20:13] finally comes to that place
[1:20:15] i mean it's almost like a child having a
[1:20:18] woman having a child
[1:20:20] you're going along and everything's okay
[1:20:22] and all of a sudden bam
[1:20:24] i've never had a child but i have a wife
[1:20:26] who's had three
[1:20:27] and i know what that time is like
[1:20:29] well we only had two times like that
[1:20:31] where it comes bam you just you're
[1:20:33] laying in bed or you're eating dinner
[1:20:35] you're you're just living your life and
[1:20:36] all of a sudden baby it's here got to go
[1:20:38] to the hospital
[1:20:40] are you sure
[1:20:42] we're going to the hospital
[1:20:44] okay well let me take a shower no we're
[1:20:46] going now
[1:20:49] we're going to the hospital it's like
[1:20:50] that yeah understand it it hits it's
[1:20:53] just like that you think you've hit your
[1:20:55] life and you've gone along and you might
[1:20:57] have even had an alcoholic beverage in
[1:20:59] your hand or or in the you might have
[1:21:00] been pulling on the uh that one armed
[1:21:02] devil
[1:21:04] but it come to you
[1:21:06] and you pulling yourself
[1:21:08] wait
[1:21:09] i don't belong here
[1:21:11] amen this is not who i am this is not
[1:21:14] what i've put on this earth for right
[1:21:17] and you recognize who you are
[1:21:20] i don't belong here i don't belong to
[1:21:22] this one i don't belong to that one you
[1:21:24] even come to realization even though i
[1:21:26] am abundant i'm a child of god first
[1:21:29] i belong in the economy in the family of
[1:21:31] god first
[1:21:33] that's my true inheritance
[1:21:35] my real true inheritance was i am a a
[1:21:39] part of the family of god that's who i
[1:21:42] am that's who my that's what my life is
[1:21:45] and it comes to that realization bam now
[1:21:47] you might not have said well i got to go
[1:21:48] to the hospital right this second
[1:21:50] sometimes people might start reading
[1:21:52] their bible again
[1:21:53] amen they might go to church again or
[1:21:56] something or they might just just some
[1:21:58] little thing a lot of times it was
[1:22:00] because of someone how someone was
[1:22:02] raised but maybe not
[1:22:04] but it it it hits you in a way where you
[1:22:07] know
[1:22:08] there's just at that point there's no
[1:22:11] turning back
[1:22:13] there there's there's no going back
[1:22:16] and from that point you know and and
[1:22:20] there's
[1:22:21] and that's what you are and who you are
[1:22:23] from that point forward
[1:22:25] and then you just get deeper and deeper
[1:22:27] and more and more and you grow and you
[1:22:29] grow you get into the lord and you
[1:22:31] realize that there's so much more to
[1:22:34] this
[1:22:34] amen than just just uh coming to church
[1:22:37] or or
[1:22:39] filling up the seat on a on a pew or
[1:22:41] something you you recognize
[1:22:45] who you are
[1:22:47] who god has made you
[1:22:49] why he put you here
[1:22:51] and what the real
[1:22:53] meaning behind you is
[1:22:56] the real meaning i mean brother brother
[1:22:58] said god would bankrupt heaven for one
[1:23:00] of his children you ever think of that
[1:23:02] right you think of the fact that banker
[1:23:04] how could you bankrupt heaven first of
[1:23:06] all
[1:23:07] you couldn't
[1:23:08] so that just puts the magnitude of it he
[1:23:10] talked about the soul being more 10
[1:23:12] million worlds
[1:23:13] what's the value of 10 million worlds
[1:23:15] how could you even invite you that right
[1:23:17] i imagine somebody was smart other than
[1:23:19] me uh or outside of me could probably
[1:23:21] figure that out on what the wealth of
[1:23:22] the world is today and do 10 million of
[1:23:25] them i don't know but could you imagine
[1:23:27] just that
[1:23:28] to recognize
[1:23:30] one person you
[1:23:33] you
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:35] are that one that god promised that god
[1:23:39] that god chose that god said i would do
[1:23:41] this for you all right
[1:23:44] you're my son
[1:23:45] you're my daughter
[1:23:47] you belong to me
[1:23:48] now i want you to understand
[1:23:51] the relationship of son and daughter is
[1:23:54] our relationship with god here
[1:23:57] just like our relationship as bride
[1:23:59] and feminist spirit is our relationship
[1:24:02] to christ here
[1:24:04] here
[1:24:05] amen and it will be
[1:24:07] uh
[1:24:08] as time goes on and and as time even
[1:24:10] ends through the white throne judgment
[1:24:12] that but there will be a time frame
[1:24:15] where because the the real relationship
[1:24:18] of you to god is the fact that you are
[1:24:20] god
[1:24:21] that's the real relationship
[1:24:24] because that's who you really are
[1:24:26] the son and daughter part is just
[1:24:28] because of this i'm a begotten son
[1:24:32] well the son that's begotten had a
[1:24:34] beginning
[1:24:35] well if a son has begotten had a
[1:24:36] beginning a son this begotten will have
[1:24:38] an end right
[1:24:40] amen amen well then what's the real
[1:24:42] relationship we have to god we are god
[1:24:45] yes
[1:24:46] that that's that part of us who we are
[1:24:48] now again we're living in the sticky
[1:24:50] flesh and the relationship we have the
[1:24:52] sons and daughters and this flesh spirit
[1:24:54] and that we live in life
[1:24:56] that's all a part of what we go through
[1:24:58] here as god had commissioned and called
[1:25:00] for us to do from the time that he spoke
[1:25:02] adam into existence
[1:25:04] and we're here at this time and would
[1:25:06] have been
[1:25:07] gone through that as as as spoken word
[1:25:10] beings if there hadn't been a fall in
[1:25:13] the garden of eden
[1:25:14] that's how we would have been
[1:25:16] as god spoke that and put man in flesh
[1:25:19] to have fellowship like that
[1:25:21] amen god just took part of himself and
[1:25:24] put it in adam
[1:25:25] just like god took a part of himself and
[1:25:27] put it in you right now that part of god
[1:25:30] who you are is the real relationship you
[1:25:32] have to god and and that eternal part of
[1:25:36] who god is is who you are
[1:25:39] praise the lord amen that's who i am
[1:25:42] well no wonder if god said a brother and
[1:25:44] said god would bankrupt heaven for one
[1:25:46] of you
[1:25:48] that's himself
[1:25:50] and paul said no man hateth his own
[1:25:52] flesh right well no god god has never
[1:25:55] hated himself
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:58] and that's who he's put in each one of
[1:26:00] us right himself
[1:26:03] let me finish this
[1:26:05] when the fullness of the time was come
[1:26:07] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:26:08] and made it in law to redeem them that
[1:26:10] were under the law that he might receive
[1:26:12] the adoption of sons now that placement
[1:26:15] to receive that placement as a son
[1:26:19] even jesus
[1:26:20] the flesh of god
[1:26:23] said okay the flesh of god
[1:26:25] jesus amen was a begotten son amen
[1:26:30] it's what the bible says
[1:26:32] he was the only begotten son
[1:26:36] but he received a position of placement
[1:26:39] when he got older he grew up
[1:26:42] amen when he was 12 years old he was in
[1:26:44] the in the temple confounding the
[1:26:46] professors and the smart ones and the
[1:26:48] ones that knew the torah better than
[1:26:49] anybody he was compounding them
[1:26:52] at twelve
[1:26:54] but he got to the place that he reached
[1:26:55] his his place of maturity in the word
[1:26:59] which sounds strange because he was the
[1:27:01] word
[1:27:02] and when he reached that place and his
[1:27:04] ministry began
[1:27:05] and his his real ministry began
[1:27:08] that's when people started hating him
[1:27:10] they marveled at him as a 12 year old
[1:27:12] boy they didn't hate him but when he
[1:27:14] started getting up and driving them out
[1:27:16] of the temple with the ropes and all
[1:27:19] that's when they unless you eat my flesh
[1:27:21] and drink my blood you have no life in
[1:27:22] you they they hated it
[1:27:25] they didn't want him but because he he
[1:27:26] came contrary not to the word but to
[1:27:29] their traditions
[1:27:31] and they hated it not because he came
[1:27:33] contrary to the word even though they
[1:27:36] accused him of that he came contrary to
[1:27:38] their traditions
[1:27:40] and that's why they hated it
[1:27:43] but
[1:27:44] when he came to that place as an
[1:27:46] adoptive son
[1:27:47] his position and he took that position
[1:27:51] right he lived in that position
[1:27:54] when they hung him on on the cross at
[1:27:55] calvary he could have called 12 legions
[1:27:58] of angels to come and rescue him and
[1:27:59] pull him off of that cross he could have
[1:28:02] stopped it at any time
[1:28:03] he could have foiled it he could have
[1:28:05] told pilate he could there was you read
[1:28:08] through the story of the passion and
[1:28:10] you'll see how many times or watch that
[1:28:12] movie you can if you in your mind
[1:28:14] envision the power of god how many times
[1:28:17] he could have circumvented this
[1:28:19] crucifixion
[1:28:21] he could have stopped it or ended it
[1:28:23] right there
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:26] even to where him saying that could call
[1:28:27] 12 legions of angels and they would come
[1:28:30] right now and rescue me
[1:28:31] and pull me away from this but he had a
[1:28:34] position
[1:28:35] he had a placement he had a a job he had
[1:28:39] to fulfill
[1:28:41] he was an adoptive son
[1:28:43] and as his adoption his placement it put
[1:28:46] him on calvary and he knew it
[1:28:51] but he and and accepted it
[1:28:53] when his sweat became his drops of blood
[1:28:56] when he cried lord if this cup could
[1:28:58] pass for me
[1:28:59] but he said not not my will but i will
[1:29:01] be done what was he talking about he was
[1:29:03] talking about the adopted sun part
[1:29:06] but the placement the adoption
[1:29:10] press forward through his life
[1:29:12] to fulfill the purpose that he was here
[1:29:14] for right amen amen
[1:29:17] even if it meant putting him in the most
[1:29:19] cruel depth on the most cruel place
[1:29:22] which is a tree
[1:29:24] the cross
[1:29:26] the most cruel death
[1:29:27] agonizing shame pain all he went through
[1:29:31] he did that because of that placement
[1:29:34] that was a part of his
[1:29:35] adoption
[1:29:37] was to fulfill that purpose right just
[1:29:39] like a part of our adoption is to
[1:29:41] fulfill the purpose that god has called
[1:29:43] us to whatever it is
[1:29:45] you have to know what yours is
[1:29:48] we all do yes
[1:29:51] that that
[1:29:53] he received we receive as sons and
[1:29:56] daughters
[1:29:57] we receive it as sons and daughters
[1:29:59] because remember only the son and
[1:30:00] daughter is the one that's adopted that
[1:30:02] the one that shows their placement
[1:30:04] i mean i when i was when i was well
[1:30:08] i was going to say when i was growing up
[1:30:09] but
[1:30:10] uh when i was growing up
[1:30:12] neighbors did with other parents kids
[1:30:15] with their permission by the way if they
[1:30:17] did something wrong
[1:30:19] can't do that now goodness you can't
[1:30:20] even hardly anyway we'll we'll get past
[1:30:23] that but
[1:30:24] i don't go to
[1:30:26] uh my neighbor
[1:30:28] and say okay i think your son should do
[1:30:30] this this and this this is what it
[1:30:32] should be this is how he should act this
[1:30:34] is where he should go this is that's not
[1:30:36] my business
[1:30:38] it's not my job because he's not my son
[1:30:42] but if we're his son
[1:30:45] it's his place
[1:30:47] for our position
[1:30:48] to be adopted in what way he wants us to
[1:30:51] go yes whatever that is
[1:30:53] as sons and daughters you don't
[1:30:55] adoptives and not sons and daughters
[1:30:57] you don't place a niece or nephew
[1:31:00] amen you don't place grandchildren it's
[1:31:02] not my position to place those two
[1:31:04] children it's his parents
[1:31:06] amen not mine it's theirs right just
[1:31:09] like it's god's
[1:31:11] for us it's his position it's his place
[1:31:14] to do that so you have to be a son or
[1:31:15] daughter to be placed
[1:31:18] to be adopted you must already be a son
[1:31:20] or daughter that's what jesus was when
[1:31:23] he reached that fullness of that
[1:31:25] dispensation that fullness of time
[1:31:29] he was made to redeem them that were
[1:31:31] under the law
[1:31:33] how did he do it through his adoption
[1:31:36] process which included going to calvary
[1:31:38] shedding his blood
[1:31:40] sixth verse now i like this now sixth
[1:31:43] verse and because ye are sons and i stop
[1:31:48] past tense that's not future tense that
[1:31:50] is present tense you are
[1:31:53] sons
[1:31:54] amen because you are a son
[1:31:58] because you are a daughter can you
[1:32:00] believe that this morning
[1:32:02] i am a son of god amos amen
[1:32:06] i i love this song the gaither scene
[1:32:10] i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[1:32:13] you know that song
[1:32:14] i'm just a sinner
[1:32:17] saved by grace you ever heard that song
[1:32:20] yes i really i enjoyed the song i like
[1:32:22] it has a good melody to it i always like
[1:32:24] the melody songs right but
[1:32:26] i like the song but it really is not
[1:32:30] scripturally accurate when you dig it
[1:32:31] out because actually i'm way more than
[1:32:33] just a sinner say my grace
[1:32:37] the song and this and it's accuracy i'm
[1:32:39] just a oh not really i'm i'm way more
[1:32:42] actually than just a sinner saved by
[1:32:44] grace
[1:32:46] what's in me possesses all of heaven and
[1:32:48] earth because it's god
[1:32:50] right
[1:32:51] but
[1:32:52] because you are sons because you are i
[1:32:56] am you are right now
[1:32:58] sons will say of course that that
[1:33:00] includes humanity
[1:33:02] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:33:05] into your hearts crying father father
[1:33:08] have thy father wherefore thou art no
[1:33:11] more a servant but a son
[1:33:13] and if a son then an heir of god through
[1:33:17] christ
[1:33:19] praise the lord now we're heirs family
[1:33:23] family
[1:33:24] you know
[1:33:26] i'm a son to my parents
[1:33:28] but i'm a i'm a brother to my sister i'm
[1:33:30] not a son to my sister
[1:33:32] i'm a brother
[1:33:34] i i'm a nephew to my to my uncle
[1:33:38] even if
[1:33:39] even if by marriage
[1:33:40] i'm not a son to robert my my uncle
[1:33:45] i'm a nephew
[1:33:48] do you understand or brother-in-law
[1:33:49] excuse me my brother-in-law i
[1:33:52] but i'm not a son
[1:33:54] see the placement has to be true
[1:33:57] and it's just a natural typing the
[1:33:59] spiritual
[1:34:00] because it's the same thing where god
[1:34:02] put us here we're no more servants but
[1:34:04] we're a son if we're something where a
[1:34:07] son we're heirs
[1:34:08] of god
[1:34:10] through christ we're family
[1:34:12] heirs of god through christ because
[1:34:14] christ he had to come to his place of
[1:34:17] adoption as well just like all the rest
[1:34:19] of us
[1:34:20] when jesus came to his adoption on the
[1:34:22] on the mount transfiguration
[1:34:26] well let's just read it man let's go to
[1:34:28] matthew 17.
[1:34:35] matthew chapter 17.
[1:34:38] i told you it's gonna be two or three
[1:34:41] parts whatever anyway so
[1:34:43] i'll never finish this today but matthew
[1:34:46] 17 verse 1
[1:34:51] oh my
[1:34:52] you know there's there's a lot of power
[1:34:55] in in understanding in in the revelation
[1:34:59] of who you are
[1:35:02] you understand it takes
[1:35:04] knowing who you are i mean who you
[1:35:06] really are it takes away all the doubt
[1:35:09] yes it takes away all the fear
[1:35:11] it takes away any disillusionment or any
[1:35:15] worry
[1:35:17] you don't worry and doubt about the
[1:35:20] human part of us the spirit part of us
[1:35:22] our imagination and our reasoning
[1:35:25] those things they bring doubt and worry
[1:35:27] but the real part of that we recognize
[1:35:30] who we are there's no doubt about that
[1:35:32] there's no worry over it
[1:35:35] because
[1:35:38] we are
[1:35:40] that part of god who we placed in us
[1:35:44] and if we understand that and who we are
[1:35:47] in that how can we worry what is there
[1:35:49] to worry about
[1:35:51] who is there to worry for
[1:35:55] understand that they're mine
[1:35:58] they belong to me they're they're part
[1:36:00] of my inheritance
[1:36:02] they don't belong to the devil they
[1:36:03] don't belong to the world they belong to
[1:36:05] me now i mean i might have had a
[1:36:06] squatter right on them for a little bit
[1:36:08] but they belong to me amen
[1:36:11] they belong to god yes so what's there
[1:36:13] to worry about
[1:36:15] we don't
[1:36:17] can't worry
[1:36:18] because
[1:36:19] we belong to him yeah
[1:36:21] matthew 17 1 after six days jesus uh
[1:36:25] taketh peter james and john his brother
[1:36:27] and bringeth him up into a high mountain
[1:36:28] apart was transfigured before them his
[1:36:31] face did shine as the sun as raiment was
[1:36:33] white as the light behold there appeared
[1:36:35] unto mo unto them moses and elijah
[1:36:37] talking to with them
[1:36:39] then answered peter said unto uh unto
[1:36:41] jesus lord
[1:36:43] it is good for us to be here
[1:36:45] if thou wilt let us make here three
[1:36:47] tabernacles one for thee one for moses
[1:36:49] one for alliance now notice peter was a
[1:36:52] big mouth was not converted yet god used
[1:36:56] that wonderful big mouth after he was
[1:36:57] converted to save thousands of souls
[1:37:00] but he wasn't at this point
[1:37:02] so
[1:37:03] he
[1:37:04] i say
[1:37:06] he spoke out of turn
[1:37:08] he said why why would you say that peter
[1:37:11] spoke out of turn here brother you that
[1:37:13] i mean that's good it was i'm sure they
[1:37:15] felt yeah it was good for us to be here
[1:37:16] that's wonderful
[1:37:18] but
[1:37:18] i i would say he spoke out of turn
[1:37:22] during this
[1:37:23] unbelievably momentous occasion which he
[1:37:25] did not understand
[1:37:27] obviously peter james and john didn't
[1:37:29] know what was going on right even after
[1:37:31] it was over
[1:37:32] after it was converted
[1:37:34] i believe so i didn't understand what
[1:37:37] was going on here see but
[1:37:39] he made this acknowledgment oh lord it's
[1:37:42] good for us to be here let's make a
[1:37:43] tabernacle for each of the three of them
[1:37:46] but the reason i say he spoke out of
[1:37:48] turn
[1:37:50] when he really should have been quiet
[1:37:52] was that jesus never acknowledged him
[1:37:54] now you read the story of it jesus never
[1:37:57] acknowledges peter about this he never
[1:37:59] answers him he never gives any credence
[1:38:02] to anything peter just said it was just
[1:38:04] as though it was it was his it kept the
[1:38:08] end the entire adoption process kept
[1:38:11] flowing forward as if peter had never
[1:38:13] said that
[1:38:14] you read it let's let's read it
[1:38:17] moses won for life while he yet spake
[1:38:20] behold a bright cloud overshadowed them
[1:38:22] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:38:24] which said this is my beloved son in
[1:38:26] whom i am well pleased hear ye him
[1:38:30] it was this if though peter didn't you
[1:38:32] say anything
[1:38:33] it wasn't even acknowledged
[1:38:36] at all
[1:38:37] ignored
[1:38:38] so that that's my premise of that in
[1:38:41] this sacred situation that we're going
[1:38:43] through here but but jesus but but god
[1:38:48] is is
[1:38:49] coming down in that great light and and
[1:38:52] speaking out to the witnesses that were
[1:38:54] there remember that
[1:38:55] establishing two or three witnesses
[1:38:57] three of course being perfection
[1:39:00] peter james and john there witnessing
[1:39:03] the adoption of jesus
[1:39:05] and the voice of god crying out this is
[1:39:08] my beloved son
[1:39:10] hear ye him
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:14] that's a transfer
[1:39:17] that's like a man who built and owns a
[1:39:19] company
[1:39:20] coming before his board of uh uh of of
[1:39:24] investors
[1:39:26] or advisors or whoever they are coming
[1:39:29] before his board and saying this is my
[1:39:32] son
[1:39:34] he has done everything he was required
[1:39:36] to do
[1:39:37] he is more than adequate and able to
[1:39:39] take over this company hear him
[1:39:43] in other words not me
[1:39:45] him
[1:39:46] go to him now this ain't mary
[1:39:49] mary's not the media tricks here
[1:39:51] god didn't god didn't say go to mary he
[1:39:54] said go to christ jesus this is my son
[1:39:58] hear him
[1:40:00] amen oh yeah the company's still intact
[1:40:04] the company's gonna run just like he had
[1:40:06] been running but now he's running it
[1:40:10] all that power all that authority is now
[1:40:13] in him
[1:40:15] that was his position
[1:40:17] that was his place
[1:40:19] that's why we go to him yet today for
[1:40:22] that very reason because he is our
[1:40:25] intermediate he is our intercessor
[1:40:28] like we said he is our
[1:40:30] our
[1:40:31] physician he's our uh
[1:40:34] alpha omega he's everything
[1:40:38] jesus all that all that was in god he
[1:40:40] poured into christ
[1:40:42] amen and he and in the adoption process
[1:40:45] he says now hear him
[1:40:47] he's reached that fullness of that place
[1:40:50] the fullness of that dispensation of him
[1:40:53] learning the business learning the
[1:40:55] company learning the people learning
[1:40:57] everything he needs to know to run this
[1:40:59] company exactly the way i did
[1:41:02] is now his place
[1:41:05] amen hear him yes praise the lord that
[1:41:09] was his place
[1:41:11] the position that god gave hear him now
[1:41:14] he is in that place
[1:41:16] that we are to listen that we are to
[1:41:18] follow that we are to obey
[1:41:20] because he was the one that was given as
[1:41:23] the only begotten son to take away the
[1:41:26] sin of the world
[1:41:27] to take away our sin to take our sin
[1:41:30] upon himself and annihilate it with the
[1:41:32] blood he shed at california
[1:41:35] that was his position that was his
[1:41:37] placement as an eternal son
[1:41:40] amen now let's get to one part before we
[1:41:43] close
[1:41:45] one other part i wanted to get to first
[1:41:47] john
[1:41:48] chapter 3.
[1:41:55] first john chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:42:04] praise the lord
[1:42:08] god
[1:42:08] it's revelation amen
[1:42:11] who i
[1:42:12] am this predestination
[1:42:16] of who i am
[1:42:18] why because it was
[1:42:22] well in our human
[1:42:24] language we can only speak on beginnings
[1:42:27] we use the word eternity a lot or never
[1:42:29] had a beginning but in our in our
[1:42:32] vernacular so many times we say
[1:42:36] in the beginning
[1:42:38] but in god there was no beginning
[1:42:41] he just always was
[1:42:43] and i
[1:42:45] i'll as i've told you before i'd be just
[1:42:48] as perfectly blunt and honest with you i
[1:42:50] still can't fathom that
[1:42:52] i i still can't
[1:42:54] because my
[1:42:57] insufficient little p brain
[1:42:59] can absolutely not reach back beyond
[1:43:02] where there was ever a beginning
[1:43:05] i told you when i was when i was a young
[1:43:07] boy i used to ask my god my dad i said
[1:43:10] where did god come from well he said the
[1:43:13] bible says god come from team i said
[1:43:14] what's timo where was it
[1:43:16] how did it begin
[1:43:18] how was there a start there
[1:43:20] and of course you can't answer that
[1:43:21] question nobody can answer that question
[1:43:24] all you can say is he's the great elohim
[1:43:26] always was always will be he's the
[1:43:27] self-existing god he just always was
[1:43:31] everything we deal with and everything
[1:43:33] we look at and everything in our human
[1:43:35] life it had a
[1:43:36] beginning it has a start to it but they
[1:43:39] had to start it's going to have an end
[1:43:41] so you got to reach eternity somewhere
[1:43:43] and how can you do it
[1:43:44] because of him
[1:43:47] he's eternal
[1:43:48] only way to do it
[1:43:50] now chapter 3
[1:43:51] first john chapter 3 behold what manner
[1:43:54] of love
[1:43:55] the father has bestowed upon us
[1:43:57] that we should be called amen the sons
[1:44:01] of god
[1:44:02] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:44:04] because it knew him not now notice how
[1:44:06] this adopted process
[1:44:09] is playing out through this scripture
[1:44:10] that john wrote here
[1:44:12] he said
[1:44:14] we should be called the sons of god
[1:44:16] acknowledged as a son of god
[1:44:20] therefore what the world
[1:44:23] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[1:44:25] who him christ
[1:44:28] what was the reference now the reference
[1:44:31] was our sonship
[1:44:34] is relative to this world
[1:44:37] just like christ sonship was relative to
[1:44:40] this world
[1:44:42] he said because therefore the world
[1:44:46] knoweth us not
[1:44:47] so the sonship of being called the son
[1:44:49] of god is relative to the world
[1:44:52] and our relationship amen
[1:44:55] of him here in that adoptive process is
[1:44:59] is here now in this world i've heard
[1:45:02] people say well they they look to be
[1:45:04] adopted when they when they go on the
[1:45:06] other side friend you're missing the
[1:45:08] whole point
[1:45:10] what what would be the point of finding
[1:45:13] a place of adoption over there right
[1:45:17] the whole point is finding our place
[1:45:19] here yeah and knowing what god wants us
[1:45:22] to do here and now right
[1:45:25] it's no wonder
[1:45:27] it's no wonder that people come so many
[1:45:30] times my it just it just seems to get
[1:45:32] more rampant all the time
[1:45:34] that people
[1:45:36] come to the place
[1:45:38] that they feel like the unknown
[1:45:41] is a better
[1:45:42] solution than what they have in this
[1:45:45] life
[1:45:47] because most people don't know they kill
[1:45:48] themselves they don't know what they're
[1:45:49] doing where they're going what's going
[1:45:50] to happen
[1:45:52] but they'd rather take their chances
[1:45:55] with the unknown
[1:45:57] through suicide
[1:45:59] than what they have here
[1:46:01] right that's that
[1:46:04] that's just so sad especially
[1:46:07] in relation to what we're talking about
[1:46:09] in that placement what's the point of
[1:46:11] being placed over there
[1:46:15] the point of the sonship that we are in
[1:46:18] relation to god is now
[1:46:20] our adoption is now
[1:46:22] what god wants to use us for and do for
[1:46:25] us and through us is now
[1:46:27] not over there
[1:46:32] so this world
[1:46:34] our son
[1:46:35] our our placement
[1:46:38] as sons of god
[1:46:39] is known to the world but they don't
[1:46:41] know you as that the world doesn't the
[1:46:43] cosmos doesn't
[1:46:46] beloved
[1:46:47] now
[1:46:48] i like this it goes with galatians 4
[1:46:51] again see
[1:46:52] now are we the sons of god
[1:46:56] and it does not yet appear or that word
[1:46:59] is manifest or made known to uncover
[1:47:03] appear
[1:47:04] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:47:07] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:47:10] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:47:12] as he is
[1:47:13] and every man that had this hope in him
[1:47:16] purified himself even as he is pure
[1:47:20] wherefore
[1:47:21] uh whosoever committed sin transgresseth
[1:47:24] also the law
[1:47:26] for sin is the transgression of the law
[1:47:29] and ye know that he was manifested to
[1:47:31] take away our sins and in him is no sin
[1:47:35] now
[1:47:36] you know me i don't i'm not somebody to
[1:47:39] change the word
[1:47:41] but to make it
[1:47:42] a little better perspective for you
[1:47:45] let's read it like this
[1:47:47] and you know that he was manifested to
[1:47:50] take away our sins
[1:47:52] because
[1:47:55] there is no sin in him amen
[1:47:58] amen
[1:47:59] and in him is no sin
[1:48:02] the conjunction and just doesn't do it
[1:48:04] for me there
[1:48:05] it should be because he is sinless
[1:48:09] he could take away my sin yes if he was
[1:48:12] not sinless he could not take my sin
[1:48:15] away
[1:48:16] if he had not been sinless he could not
[1:48:18] have taken the book
[1:48:20] he could not have been the one that john
[1:48:22] was whipping and looked and said behold
[1:48:24] the line of the tribe of judah
[1:48:26] he couldn't have done it
[1:48:28] he couldn't take our sin unless he
[1:48:31] himself was sinless
[1:48:33] that's the only way he could do it
[1:48:34] that's why we can't take away sin
[1:48:37] i can't take your sin away right because
[1:48:39] i have sins of my own
[1:48:41] i'm a sinner too that's why john
[1:48:43] couldn't even touch or love from the
[1:48:45] book
[1:48:47] it was forbidden for john to look on the
[1:48:49] book
[1:48:50] you think might and jesus said no
[1:48:53] greater man is born of a woman than john
[1:48:55] but yet he couldn't even look on the
[1:48:57] book
[1:48:59] oh no wonder there was a lot of crying
[1:49:01] going on you figured humanity is lost at
[1:49:03] that point
[1:49:05] because if john greatest man this jesus
[1:49:08] said more to a woman couldn't even look
[1:49:10] at the book then what hope did any of us
[1:49:12] have
[1:49:13] that's why christ had to step forth as
[1:49:16] the sinless one
[1:49:18] a bloody lamb
[1:49:20] amen step forth to take that book
[1:49:22] because he was worthy
[1:49:24] because he was sinless yes amen
[1:49:29] oh thank god for that whosoever abideth
[1:49:31] in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth has
[1:49:34] not seen him neither known him
[1:49:37] little children let no man deceive you
[1:49:39] that he that doeth righteousness is
[1:49:41] righteous even as he is righteous he
[1:49:43] that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:49:46] that's pretty rough
[1:49:47] he that committed sin is of the devil
[1:49:50] you gotta understand what he's talking
[1:49:51] about here for the devil said it from
[1:49:53] the beginning
[1:49:55] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:49:57] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:50:00] works of the devil which is what
[1:50:02] sin
[1:50:03] which is what
[1:50:05] unbelief amen to destroy unbelief right
[1:50:10] well that just goes right back to our
[1:50:12] saint john chapter 3 reading the
[1:50:14] whosoever believeth
[1:50:16] in him
[1:50:18] should not perish
[1:50:20] now it takes more than let's service too
[1:50:23] because people say oh i believe in jesus
[1:50:26] others atheists say well i believe jesus
[1:50:28] existed sure i believe he was born and
[1:50:30] muslims will tell you that hebrews will
[1:50:32] tell you oh yeah there was a jesus oh
[1:50:34] yeah i believe there was a jesus the
[1:50:35] devil believes in jesus but is he saved
[1:50:38] no no no
[1:50:40] no believeth in
[1:50:42] is a revelation
[1:50:44] that you've accepted into your heart
[1:50:47] that says this is who he is
[1:50:49] not just that he existed not just that
[1:50:52] he was on this planet at some point in
[1:50:54] time
[1:50:55] i believe and know who he is the process
[1:50:58] of of him being god built in flesh
[1:51:01] and i receive him to myself that
[1:51:03] believeth has to be a reception if it's
[1:51:06] just simply all i believe he existed the
[1:51:08] devil does too but the satan doesn't
[1:51:10] receive him unto himself as his savior
[1:51:12] as his lord
[1:51:17] he that come
[1:51:18] eighth verse he committed sin is of the
[1:51:20] devil the devil sentenced from the
[1:51:22] beginning for this purpose the son of
[1:51:24] god was manifested
[1:51:26] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:51:28] devil whosoever is born of god does not
[1:51:32] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:51:37] and he cannot sin because why
[1:51:41] he's born of god
[1:51:44] where's the birth take place
[1:51:47] the birth doesn't take place out here
[1:51:49] i've already been born out here i mean
[1:51:52] nicodemus even came and asked jesus how
[1:51:54] could i enter my mother's womb the
[1:51:55] second time because he had he lacked
[1:51:58] revelation of what it meant to be born
[1:52:00] again
[1:52:01] but what does it mean to be born again
[1:52:03] born in spirit praise the lord
[1:52:06] it's got to be something that takes coun
[1:52:08] that takes place on the inside of the
[1:52:09] inside of you yes amen because the
[1:52:12] spirit's not the one that gets reborn
[1:52:14] the flesh is not the one that gets
[1:52:15] reborn so where does the birth take
[1:52:17] place it has to take place in the soul
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:21] now i
[1:52:23] i i've decided whether or not to because
[1:52:26] it's getting so late to go ahead and do
[1:52:28] this but i'll leave this because this is
[1:52:30] something that you all know that i do
[1:52:33] uh
[1:52:34] fairly often
[1:52:38] but you see the body
[1:52:42] the tron being
[1:52:45] spirit
[1:52:46] and the soul
[1:52:49] is is the triunity of our being so what
[1:52:52] of it what is this that gets born
[1:52:54] because see when he says here because he
[1:52:56] is born of god
[1:52:58] i wasn't it
[1:53:00] it doesn't say because he was born of
[1:53:02] george and jared bennett
[1:53:04] that's this guy
[1:53:06] he said he was born of god that has to
[1:53:08] be this guy yes
[1:53:10] a rebirth a renewing
[1:53:13] or
[1:53:16] a part of god which was that seed
[1:53:20] that recognized
[1:53:22] and came to life
[1:53:25] and now the resident of your soul
[1:53:30] is god
[1:53:33] your soul is
[1:53:35] god
[1:53:36] from this seed
[1:53:38] because that seed had to come forth to
[1:53:41] life
[1:53:42] that's why it said whosoever is born of
[1:53:44] god does not commit sin for his seed
[1:53:47] whose seed the seed of god amen
[1:53:50] remaining
[1:53:52] now that remains doesn't mean god put it
[1:53:55] there when you recognize
[1:53:57] i i
[1:53:59] uh
[1:54:01] micah's got a song on his phone he puts
[1:54:03] micah's got a lot of songs on his phone
[1:54:05] but there's the one where this is uh
[1:54:07] this black sister she's
[1:54:09] she's uh
[1:54:11] uh quite happy and she's singing this
[1:54:13] song about you ought to have been there
[1:54:16] when he saved my soul
[1:54:17] y'all have been there when he put my
[1:54:20] name on the roll well friend if your
[1:54:22] name is on the roll it was put on there
[1:54:24] before the foundation of the world not
[1:54:26] when you come to the altar not when you
[1:54:28] danced in the spirit not when you
[1:54:29] manifested a gift of tongues or prophecy
[1:54:32] or something but before the foundation
[1:54:34] of the world your soul was there amen
[1:54:36] that's where you were put on there
[1:54:38] that's where you were born because
[1:54:40] that's who you really are
[1:54:42] that's who we really are from before the
[1:54:45] foundation of the world and god put that
[1:54:48] seed in there and the bible says that
[1:54:50] seed remaineth
[1:54:53] it's still there
[1:54:55] but what does that seed do
[1:54:56] that seed just come to life
[1:54:59] it come to recognize look at this
[1:55:03] i was gonna read a couple quotes but i'm
[1:55:05] gonna i'm gonna skip them for maybe next
[1:55:07] time but look the seed this this word
[1:55:11] seed
[1:55:13] this is in first john 3
[1:55:15] 9 this c
[1:55:17] says
[1:55:20] from which a plant germinates
[1:55:23] the grain listen this close this is
[1:55:26] i i enjoyed this the grain or kernel
[1:55:30] which contains within itself
[1:55:34] contains within itself the germ of the
[1:55:37] future plant
[1:55:42] so when god put this seed in you
[1:55:45] by four knowledge predestination when
[1:55:48] god put that seed in you
[1:55:50] oh that time i came forth i was issued
[1:55:52] out of jeretta bennett
[1:55:54] that seeds there
[1:55:57] amen breath of life the seed is there
[1:56:00] predestinated part of god that's why
[1:56:03] people say what where what happens to
[1:56:05] babies were they predestinated
[1:56:07] if they're predestinated of god they're
[1:56:09] part of god
[1:56:10] they'll be there they're god of course
[1:56:12] all babies go to heaven we know that but
[1:56:14] as far as the rapture and predestination
[1:56:17] but that seed was always there
[1:56:20] there he comes there's that seed it
[1:56:22] remains there
[1:56:24] because that's who you really are
[1:56:26] when you are in the mind of god that's
[1:56:28] who you really are
[1:56:30] god just took from himself
[1:56:33] figure how you want to i mean it's the
[1:56:35] penny or the pinkie or the harder so
[1:56:37] figure out how you want to but god took
[1:56:39] a part of himself and put it in you and
[1:56:42] took that seed
[1:56:44] and put it in you now that scene
[1:56:46] you could take
[1:56:47] a male
[1:56:49] and you could uh you could go do an
[1:56:51] operation you could take seed out of a
[1:56:53] male
[1:56:55] and you could take a seat and you could
[1:56:56] put that and they do it
[1:56:58] um
[1:57:00] what do they call it in vitro
[1:57:03] in vitro fertilization that's what they
[1:57:04] call it i don't know how many getting
[1:57:06] that terminology wrong but they take the
[1:57:07] end of the woman in the seat of the
[1:57:09] mouth they put them together in a little
[1:57:10] dish or something they make a baby right
[1:57:13] well that's a seed
[1:57:15] well that seed has in itself
[1:57:18] the germ
[1:57:19] of the future plant
[1:57:21] of the future what you were going to be
[1:57:25] you were born in this body in this
[1:57:26] spirit
[1:57:28] as as
[1:57:29] son and daughter as brother brown said a
[1:57:31] son or daughter of uh charles and elle
[1:57:33] branham i was born a son or daughter a
[1:57:35] son i was born a son of a of george and
[1:57:38] jeretta bennett but that seed that was
[1:57:40] in there was who i am
[1:57:42] not this guy
[1:57:44] amen amen i believe that's probably why
[1:57:46] we get a new name on the other side too
[1:57:49] amen not that i'm not fond of newton
[1:57:50] it's okay george is fine too i like
[1:57:53] those it'll work for me
[1:57:54] amen but in that is the germ
[1:57:59] it's the germ of what the future you is
[1:58:01] going to be or is not going to be is
[1:58:05] now it stays dormant until that time of
[1:58:07] dispensation when you recognize
[1:58:10] that's when that spirit comes that's why
[1:58:12] the new birth takes place
[1:58:14] because the spirit comes in there and
[1:58:16] gives life to that seed
[1:58:19] and then the seed begins to germinate
[1:58:21] and grow
[1:58:22] what does it produce
[1:58:24] it doesn't produce an apple tree
[1:58:27] it doesn't produce another human earthly
[1:58:29] being it produces what the seed came
[1:58:32] from
[1:58:34] my seed produced another little mutant
[1:58:37] we call it mica but
[1:58:39] that's what it produced
[1:58:41] what does god see going to produce
[1:58:45] god she's going to produce another
[1:58:49] do i have to say it
[1:58:52] amen what is god seeing going to produce
[1:58:55] god
[1:58:57] that's why god is in you
[1:58:59] to live through this spirit through this
[1:59:02] body
[1:59:03] to show this world that he's still the
[1:59:05] same today as he has always been yes
[1:59:08] because he's living through you to do it
[1:59:10] yes
[1:59:11] that seed come to life through the new
[1:59:14] birth
[1:59:15] now now this body and this spirit are
[1:59:18] still sticky
[1:59:20] they're they're still get a little rowed
[1:59:22] sometimes or say something they
[1:59:24] shouldn't or a little anger a little
[1:59:25] spirit or something of this world and
[1:59:28] and and the layout all the seeing things
[1:59:30] that's going on around us
[1:59:31] but then it won't take long in that
[1:59:33] spirit that that that life that's in
[1:59:35] there comes forth to that spirit said no
[1:59:37] no you're not supposed to do that
[1:59:39] don't act that way don't talk that way
[1:59:40] don't be like that don't look at that
[1:59:42] don't listen to that and then it affects
[1:59:44] that body and that body says amen that's
[1:59:46] right i belong to god i don't belong to
[1:59:48] this world those things don't attract me
[1:59:50] anymore
[1:59:51] amen
[1:59:52] and then and then you and then you are
[1:59:55] who you are see but where does that take
[1:59:56] place it takes place here
[1:59:59] that mistake
[2:00:00] that failure
[2:00:02] that fault
[2:00:03] that that that shortcoming
[2:00:05] that that you might manifest it's not
[2:00:08] down in here
[2:00:10] it's here
[2:00:11] it's in this spirit it's in this body
[2:00:13] that's where it happens through your
[2:00:14] imagination and reason memory oh my
[2:00:17] goodness memory
[2:00:19] i i
[2:00:20] when i was a kid i listened to rock and
[2:00:22] roll loved rock and roll of course now
[2:00:24] it's called classic man you want to
[2:00:25] think you're old
[2:00:27] the music used to list you and your kid
[2:00:29] are now called classic i saw a car tag
[2:00:32] the other day that said classic on it
[2:00:34] and it was like from the 80s
[2:00:37] oh man if that doesn't make a person
[2:00:39] feel old
[2:00:40] 1980 that's not classic
[2:00:43] well it is now
[2:00:45] might not used to be but it is now
[2:00:48] but i used to listen and that and you go
[2:00:50] in a restaurant or somewhere and a song
[2:00:53] comes on you used to love or something
[2:00:55] oh that that that memory
[2:00:57] come back in your spirit and
[2:01:00] your toe be tapping and your lips will
[2:01:01] be moving before you realize it
[2:01:03] because it's that memory is affecting
[2:01:05] that body that body's starting to react
[2:01:08] but then you got to allow that freeway
[2:01:10] of that that that holy spirit that life
[2:01:13] that's in there to come forth
[2:01:15] to to break that up
[2:01:17] amen and to dismiss that
[2:01:19] even if the song's over you say you know
[2:01:22] and then you come but where does that
[2:01:24] take place the point is it doesn't take
[2:01:26] place here
[2:01:28] that's why the bible says whosoever is
[2:01:31] born of god does not commit sin right
[2:01:34] he said well i just made a mistake this
[2:01:36] morning i just did something wrong this
[2:01:37] morning i just
[2:01:39] but it's not here
[2:01:41] it's over here right it's in your body
[2:01:43] that made a mistake it wasn't something
[2:01:45] that came forth from your soul remember
[2:01:47] ephesians 2 said that we had the desire
[2:01:51] to sin
[2:01:52] amen when we were in the world our
[2:01:54] desire
[2:01:56] was to sin our desire from our heart
[2:01:58] from our soul was to sin was to do
[2:02:00] things wrong because of the darkness
[2:02:02] that we were born in
[2:02:05] satan was the original
[2:02:07] the uh uh original resident
[2:02:11] darkness
[2:02:13] but then when that when that seed came
[2:02:15] to life and the holy spirit come and
[2:02:17] burn that old nature out
[2:02:20] and that and then fertilize that seed
[2:02:24] now he that is born
[2:02:26] of god born of god cannot sin
[2:02:30] where here
[2:02:33] there's no more desire for sin
[2:02:35] there's no more wanting it there's no
[2:02:37] more desire for it
[2:02:39] all the desires have been taken away
[2:02:42] because you've been born again
[2:02:45] what happens here
[2:02:47] is just the things that come in your c
[2:02:49] tasteful smell here your imagination
[2:02:51] concentration
[2:02:52] affection memory that comes into these
[2:02:54] two elements
[2:02:56] that's when that then that's when a
[2:02:58] mistake can be made because you uh
[2:03:01] your reasoning
[2:03:03] is that shouldn't have been that way
[2:03:05] and then your conscience comes and says
[2:03:07] that's right
[2:03:08] and then your affection which affection
[2:03:11] isn't just loving affection is uh um
[2:03:15] your emotions
[2:03:17] which contains anger
[2:03:19] which makes you mad
[2:03:21] and then your affection comes and says
[2:03:23] that's right that makes me mad
[2:03:26] and then maybe
[2:03:27] based on that
[2:03:28] uh when they're that spirit bristles up
[2:03:31] then you do something you shouldn't do
[2:03:33] amen but the sin didn't commit the sin
[2:03:35] didn't come from here can no longer if
[2:03:37] you're born of god you can no longer sin
[2:03:40] amen you you've lost the consciousness
[2:03:44] of sin the desire of sin once we were
[2:03:46] dead in our sins now we're dead to our
[2:03:50] sins
[2:03:51] praise the lord
[2:03:53] because that nature has been burned out
[2:03:55] and all that all that all that lives
[2:03:57] there now
[2:03:58] remember brother brown
[2:04:00] i know i'm getting laid brother branham
[2:04:02] typed that
[2:04:04] to that old railroad car
[2:04:06] remember bella ram said when on on the
[2:04:08] railroad car when you pack those real
[2:04:10] low cars right you have to close that
[2:04:12] door and if it's done right the
[2:04:14] inspector comes by and he puts a seal on
[2:04:16] that door and that door cannot be opened
[2:04:18] until it gets to his final destination
[2:04:22] now brother branham reference that to to
[2:04:24] you receiving the holy ghost and the new
[2:04:26] birth the word when thy spirit comes in
[2:04:29] there and that life is dermatized that
[2:04:32] door is shut satan has no more right to
[2:04:35] that soul
[2:04:36] he can no longer get in there yes amen
[2:04:41] and then that is the nature of the
[2:04:42] spirits the nature of the body that
[2:04:44] affects all of you and who you are
[2:04:47] amen
[2:04:48] let's stand if we could
[2:04:53] praise the lord
[2:05:02] i didn't even get a chance to get to the
[2:05:03] quote i wanted to read
[2:05:06] amen
[2:05:07] lord willing
[2:05:09] uh lord willing terry's maybe next week
[2:05:12] we'll see
[2:05:17] amen
[2:05:18] but lord knows
[2:05:19] whatever his will is
[2:05:21] we'll just do the best we can for him
[2:05:23] amen
[2:05:24] praise the lord
[2:05:25] realize
[2:05:26] who am i
[2:05:29] who am i
[2:05:30] then it becomes who i am
[2:05:33] the question to start with is who am i
[2:05:35] the question afterwards becomes or the
[2:05:38] statement afterwards becomes who i am
[2:05:40] that's not a question anymore
[2:05:42] amen that's a statement who i am who i
[2:05:45] am who am
[2:05:46] i i'm a child of god
[2:05:49] amen who am i really
[2:05:52] i'm the attribute of his seed
[2:05:55] not in this flesh
[2:05:57] the part you can't see brother said if
[2:05:59] the flesh would fall off this body right
[2:06:01] now all you'd see is god standing in
[2:06:03] front of you
[2:06:04] well he didn't exclude that to himself
[2:06:07] because it wasn't just him he was a
[2:06:09] child of god just like the rest of us
[2:06:11] born again filled with the spirit of god
[2:06:13] just like the rest of us germantis see
[2:06:15] the soul of god as just just like the
[2:06:16] rest of us the whole point he was trying
[2:06:18] to make is that look if that's the same
[2:06:20] thing as the statement i'm making it's
[2:06:22] the same thing for you
[2:06:24] we just got to believe it
[2:06:26] you know the thing that bothers us the
[2:06:27] most is this sticky flesh amen it gets
[2:06:31] us the devil uses it all the time you
[2:06:33] know he does
[2:06:34] he uses against us all the time
[2:06:36] you know you don't belong there you know
[2:06:38] you're not one of them you know you're
[2:06:39] not you know you're not you know
[2:06:41] just say that devil just like you do the
[2:06:43] other get behind me satan
[2:06:45] amen that's contrary to the word you
[2:06:48] know say jesus told peter that not
[2:06:50] because peter was a devil but because
[2:06:52] the statement he just made was against
[2:06:54] the word
[2:06:56] you know that's why peter jesus told
[2:06:58] peter that
[2:06:59] get thee behind me satan
[2:07:01] because what he was saying was contrary
[2:07:03] to the scripture
[2:07:05] that devil that was influencing that
[2:07:07] statement was contrary to the word
[2:07:09] you know why he drove them out of the
[2:07:12] temple with the with the platted ropes
[2:07:14] because it was contrary to the word
[2:07:17] that's why he did it he wasn't mean
[2:07:21] amen the bible says he looked on them
[2:07:23] with anger well what part of him looked
[2:07:25] on him with anger
[2:07:27] his body his flesh but it was the
[2:07:29] righteous anger of god
[2:07:31] contrary to the word uh that they were
[2:07:34] doing contrary to the word that drove
[2:07:36] them out of there
[2:07:37] because what they were doing was against
[2:07:39] the word right amen amen
[2:07:42] praise the lord
[2:07:43] let's stand on that word amen
