[1:15] i pray if you watch it live or if you

[1:18] richly bless you uh through what he
[1:21] would speak to us today and
[1:23] we thank the lord for his word we thank
[1:25] him for his goodness
[1:26] thank him for this day that he's given
[1:28] us this day is unlike any other day
[1:30] friend that we're going through and
[1:32] we've seen many days and i know there's
[1:34] been days in the past but
[1:35] this day is the day and this is the time
[1:38] in the season of a rapture that a
[1:40] bride's about to be caught away to go
[1:42] home to be with him
[1:43] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:46] it's a
[1:46] quite a time that we live but i'm very
[1:48] thankful that the lord has
[1:51] made a way in the ability to be able to
[1:53] still communicate and get together and
[1:55] spend time together just i would
[1:58] encourage you
[1:59] to please don't get comfortable being at
[2:01] home
[2:03] my home is a place of comfort i know
[2:05] that but
[2:06] there's nothing like gathering together
[2:08] with those of like precious faith and i
[2:10] believe that's scriptural
[2:11] and uh you come and you're there
[2:13] regularly you understand
[2:15] uh the spirit that's there and the
[2:16] lord's blessed our services so much and
[2:19] so just don't get comfortable sitting
[2:20] there i'm not going to get comfortable
[2:22] being here i never did
[2:24] and i'm still not but lord willing
[2:27] next week we'll be in service next week
[2:30] uh back the way things were i will have
[2:33] service next week there at
[2:34] our regular um building
[2:38] so i'll just remember that in prayer all
[2:40] of us are still perfectly healthy and
[2:42] fine
[2:43] me and sonia's perfectly healthy and
[2:45] fine
[2:46] joel and emma and zach and tabitha are
[2:48] perfectly fine
[2:50] uh that a false positive test hasn't
[2:53] affected us
[2:53] any so we're just very thankful that
[2:55] god's blessed us i work
[2:57] most of the week all week and um guys
[3:00] just take god takes care of his own
[3:02] so i appreciate that uh he never leaves
[3:05] us or forsakes us friend
[3:06] you know sometimes it seems like and
[3:08] maybe i preach a message on this
[3:10] sometimes but i was thinking about this
[3:11] the other day and that's
[3:13] praying and talking to the lord and i
[3:14] said you know it seems like
[3:16] humans get so conditioned in our minds
[3:19] and our spirits to
[3:20] accept failure and accept disappointment
[3:23] and believe that even those that are the
[3:25] closest and dearest to us in our lives
[3:27] are going to disappoint us
[3:29] and they're going to let us down and um
[3:31] and and even gonna hurt us
[3:33] uh and then sometimes it seems like we
[3:36] transition that over into the spirit
[3:38] realm and
[3:39] to god and it's almost like we think
[3:42] it's
[3:43] on some level that god's going to
[3:45] disappoint us eventually
[3:46] that god's going to eventually let us
[3:48] down that god's going to eventually
[3:50] leave us or leave us alone whatever
[3:54] you know bring disappointment
[3:58] as far as him but friend that'll never
[4:00] happen
[4:01] god can never leave god can never
[4:03] forsake god
[4:04] never let down god can never disappoint
[4:07] uh
[4:07] so we gotta morph ourselves out of that
[4:11] time thought of you know in this life in
[4:14] this world of
[4:15] how those things go along and just
[4:18] forget about that
[4:19] and know that god is always going to be
[4:21] there he's never
[4:22] going to do what we have and received
[4:26] from other humans
[4:28] so and based on that we're
[4:31] very thankful again today to have you
[4:34] here and to have this ability
[4:36] to stream today and pray that the lord
[4:38] bless you richly
[4:39] before we go to the lord in prayer now i
[4:42] have a couple prayer requests a few
[4:44] prayer requests actually
[4:46] uh didn't realize how many there were
[4:48] but i wrote a few of them down i usually
[4:50] can remember them but
[4:51] i didn't want to make sure and leave
[4:53] anybody out so
[4:54] i'll have a prayer request brother danny
[4:58] had sent me a request
[5:02] as we were talking uh yesterday he had
[5:05] told me that his upper dental plate had
[5:07] broken
[5:08] so it's kind of expensive to get a new
[5:10] one he was hoping that they could fix
[5:11] the one he has
[5:13] so please remember him in prayer
[5:14] remember that situation
[5:16] they could fix that plate so that he
[5:19] doesn't have to spend over a thousand
[5:20] dollars for a new one so
[5:22] remember him in prayer also remember
[5:25] sister lydia and their family
[5:26] uh fortunately and thankfully brother
[5:29] john and brother ralph
[5:30] tested negative for covid uh but she
[5:33] told me that jennifer's still not
[5:35] feeling well and
[5:36] lydia herself is having some symptoms
[5:38] yet
[5:39] so please remember them in prayer if you
[5:40] would god would keep his hand upon them
[5:43] and continue to heal and touch them
[5:45] also sister sheila had mentioned that
[5:49] harlan her brother is supposed to
[5:52] hopefully
[5:53] finally maybe have his court date this
[5:56] wednesday the 20th
[5:57] inauguration day uh no less uh
[6:00] she wants us to remember harlan in
[6:02] prayer the lord would just find favor
[6:04] with harlan and and
[6:06] with the relationship with his wife you
[6:07] know my prayers that they could
[6:09] reconcile and
[6:10] that they would serve the lord together
[6:12] and that god would bless their marriage
[6:13] and
[6:14] that they could be together but of
[6:15] course with this court date just trust
[6:17] in the lord would help harlan
[6:19] and help men that situation with his
[6:21] wife and
[6:22] of course find favor with the court
[6:24] system so please remember that in prayer
[6:25] and also
[6:26] i got a call kind of late last night
[6:29] wasn't too late but
[6:30] um that brother pat had called me in and
[6:33] told me that his first wife sonya had
[6:35] passed away
[6:37] um gonna be grieving of course with pat

[6:41] that was his mother brother pat's first
[6:43] son

[7:06] connected there uh be grieving today so
[7:09] please remember them in prayer
[7:10] the lord would just touch them and help
[7:12] them now you know seems like
[7:15] a lot of light is leaving the world
[7:17] today a lot of people passing away a lot
[7:19] of believers
[7:20] um brother roger had showed me i'd known
[7:23] a couple of them but brother rodriguez
[7:24] showed me something somebody had said to
[7:26] him
[7:27] five message ministers went on to be
[7:30] with the lord
[7:30] in one week i believe it was last week
[7:33] not this past week but the week before
[7:35] five in one week had gone to be with the
[7:37] lord and you won ropi turner
[7:39] that didn't include brother jim
[7:41] diffendorfer we know here in tucson
[7:43] who did minister a little bit so a lot
[7:46] of light
[7:47] i spoke to a couple weeks ago at the
[7:49] church about that little sliver of light
[7:51] that god put in there for this last age
[7:52] that light
[7:54] is getting darker that darkness is
[7:56] encroaching in as that light
[7:58] goes from the earth and eventually the
[8:00] the culmination of the last of that
[8:02] light is going to leave this earth
[8:04] and it'll be nothing but total darkness
[8:07] uh but
[8:09] but but we're here so praise the lord
[8:11] and thankful for that but remember these
[8:13] prayer requests if you would
[8:14] and we'll pray together now and just
[8:16] trust the lord
[8:18] as he is mindful of those needs to hold
[8:20] them before the lord so let's pray if we
[8:22] put it together now
[8:24] precious lord we're so thankful jesus
[8:26] for all the greatness
[8:27] love and mercy that you give lord you're
[8:30] so good to us and we thank you for this
[8:32] word we thank you for the time to meet
[8:34] together

[10:25] may it sweep through every house
[10:27] every building every place where anybody

[10:37] we committed to you in the name of the
[10:39] lord jesus christ we pray
[10:41] amen god bless you
[10:44] now i've uh
[10:47] got a thought that uh kind of came to me
[10:50] yesterday is
[10:51] i had something i wanted to speak to
[10:52] this i still do have something that i
[10:54] want to speak to you about
[10:56] but i want to do it live in person and
[10:58] actually it seems to have grown into
[10:59] maybe two or three different services
[11:02] uh so i want to speak to you about that
[11:04] i mentioned to you in a
[11:05] text yesterday that something very
[11:07] serious i want to talk to you very
[11:09] important i want to talk to you about
[11:10] too that is off camera
[11:12] that'll be a that won't be stream
[11:14] that'll be something totally different
[11:15] but
[11:16] uh but the messages that i had on my
[11:18] heart so when it came to looking that
[11:20] uh we were gonna do the streaming again
[11:21] today the lord just
[11:23] almost as quick as i felt decided to do
[11:26] this
[11:27] instead of meeting in person uh put
[11:29] something on my heart as a
[11:31] i was texting back and forth with sister
[11:33] sheila and
[11:34] uh she was talking about the great surge
[11:36] of
[11:37] uh covet going on today and if you watch
[11:39] the news or listen to things that go on
[11:41] in the country in the world
[11:43] uh and this surge that's happening they
[11:45] always talk about the surge
[11:47] either either we're either surging or
[11:49] there's about to be a surge
[11:51] if you watch the news or listen to
[11:52] people this is the darkest hour this is
[11:55] the darkest time there's going to be a
[11:57] great surge there's a surge of this and
[11:59] the hospitals are surged with people and
[12:01] the covet is surging because of positive
[12:03] tests and
[12:04] now we don't even know how many of those
[12:06] positive tests are actually positive but
[12:08] anyway
[12:09] uh it just gave me a thought we don't
[12:11] need to worry about it be concerned with
[12:12] the surge of covet we need to be
[12:14] concerned with
[12:15] and look for a surge of faith a surge of
[12:19] faith today that's what we need more
[12:20] than anything
[12:21] because faith is what's going to take
[12:23] this bride out of this world
[12:25] faith is what helps mold and shape our
[12:27] lives every day
[12:28] faith is what gets us from moment to
[12:30] moment and day to day and week to week
[12:32] faith is how we live we don't step
[12:35] without faith we don't breathe without
[12:36] faith we don't live without faith
[12:38] and we need a surge of faith brother
[12:40] braden says it many many times
[12:43] if you're going to go look and just type
[12:45] in if you can in the search
[12:47] quote now a search of faith and see how
[12:50] many times he talks about
[12:52] it that surge of faith that we need and
[12:54] i just want to talk about that for a
[12:56] little bit today
[12:57] uh maybe a simplistic message or
[13:00] something just to be an
[13:01] encouragement to you but i want to start
[13:03] oddly enough
[13:04] we're not starting in hebrews 11 but i
[13:07] want to start in second kings
[13:09] second kings the sixth chapter and i
[13:12] want to read a few verses
[13:14] but then i want to revert back to the
[13:16] beginning of the chapter so
[13:18] uh but i wouldn't just read this to lay
[13:20] this foundation on this surge of faith
[13:22] that i want to talk about this morning
[13:24] so
[13:25] let's look at this second kings chapter
[13:27] six
[13:28] uh verse 13 is where i want to begin so
[13:31] let's look at that real quick
[13:32] second kings 6 13 and he said go and spy
[13:36] where he
[13:37] is now you'll get these he's when i read
[13:39] the rest of it in a minute
[13:41] uh it's actually the king of syria
[13:43] that's talking that that is the he
[13:44] that's the first he
[13:45] go and spy where he elisha is that i may
[13:49] send and fetch him
[13:51] and it was told him saying behold he is
[13:53] in dothan
[13:54] therefore sent heath through their
[13:56] horses and chariots and a great host
[13:58] and they came by night and compassed the
[14:01] city and when the servant of the man of
[14:03] god
[14:04] gaza elijah's servant
[14:07] the man of god was risen early and gone
[14:09] forth beholden hosts come past the city
[14:13] both with horses and chariots looked
[14:15] like a dire situation
[14:17] if you looked out your window today your
[14:19] house your apartment your
[14:21] uh your domicile wherever you are if you
[14:23] looked out today
[14:24] and you saw that there was horses and
[14:26] chariots
[14:27] around surrounding you let's just say
[14:30] the army of
[14:31] uh an invading country or even your own
[14:33] country
[14:34] army around you swords drawn
[14:37] guns drawn ready and you knew that they
[14:40] were there for you
[14:42] you knew that they were there to come
[14:44] and take you
[14:45] that would be a scary situation so this
[14:48] man of god this the servant of the man
[14:49] of god rose
[14:51] and went forth behold a host compassed
[14:54] the city with the horses and chariots
[14:55] and his servants said unto him now
[14:57] gaheza now said unto elisha alas
[15:00] my master what shall we do i see that's
[15:03] what the natural light thinks that's
[15:04] what the natural light
[15:06] and a lack of faith will do and he
[15:09] answered
[15:10] fear not for they that be with us
[15:13] are more than they that be with them
[15:17] amen now what are you talking about a
[15:19] surge of faith
[15:20] see that man was looking through the
[15:22] eyes of faith he wasn't looking through
[15:23] the eyes of circumstance
[15:25] he wasn't looking through the eyes of
[15:27] what's going on and
[15:28] and the doubt and unbelief and
[15:30] everything that one that the world wants
[15:31] to feed you today he was looking through
[15:33] the eyes of faith which is the eyes that
[15:35] god
[15:35] wants us to have and put on and he says
[15:38] by faith
[15:40] there are more with us than there are
[15:41] with them so if you look out
[15:43] and you saw your domicile today and it
[15:45] was surrounded you knew
[15:46] that they were there to pick you up you
[15:48] could have the exact same faith
[15:50] to know and believe well there's more
[15:52] with us than there are with them
[15:54] there's more of us than than there are
[15:56] them
[15:57] amen there's because it's the same thing
[15:59] today god has no respect for person he
[16:01] doesn't look at elijah any better more
[16:02] than he does with us
[16:04] that same thing is for the bride of
[16:06] jesus christ today as it was then
[16:08] and elisha prayed and said lord i pray
[16:11] thee
[16:12] open his eyes that he may see
[16:15] now that's the eyes of faith that
[16:18] elijah's praying to god give to gehaza
[16:21] and the lord opened the eyes of the
[16:23] young man and he saw
[16:26] wonderful and behold the mountain was
[16:29] full of horses and chariots of fire
[16:32] round about who elijah
[16:36] around about elisha amen that's where
[16:39] they were
[16:40] those chariots of fire the horses and
[16:43] chariots of fire had surrounded
[16:45] elisha now they didn't just surround
[16:47] elisha because of that circumstance
[16:50] i don't believe so because the scripture
[16:51] declares they didn't
[16:53] and we'll read that in a few minutes and
[16:55] they didn't just come
[16:56] past that at that time just because of
[16:59] elisha
[17:00] it wasn't just that specific moment
[17:02] because of those chariots that uh the
[17:04] king of syria had sent down oh no no
[17:06] these these horses and chariots of fire
[17:09] was with elijah
[17:10] elisha 24 7. they were
[17:14] there all the time because he was a
[17:16] believer
[17:17] he was a what we would call today a
[17:19] christian
[17:20] he wasn't a christian christ hadn't come
[17:22] yet but he was a believer
[17:24] he was a godly man he was a prophet of
[17:26] god now the prophet just puts him in a
[17:28] different office doesn't put him in a
[17:30] different sonship of christ
[17:32] or any closer to god than you are today
[17:34] doesn't make him any more important
[17:36] it's just the same faith that we have to
[17:38] have it's the same faith that surge of
[17:41] faith to believe
[17:42] now that surge of faith is something
[17:44] that that that we talk about the word
[17:46] surge as in something that is a
[17:48] that presses in hard but really the
[17:51] faith is there all the time
[17:53] it's just something for us that we
[17:55] believe it that we
[17:56] know when we say something or we believe
[17:59] upon that it's going
[18:00] to happen it's not a matter of doubt or
[18:03] unbelief or whether yes or no
[18:05] we know that god's going to do it it's
[18:08] there's not a question to it there's
[18:10] there's not a question to say well
[18:12] you know jesus even asked do you believe
[18:15] well that's a question
[18:16] well the question is yes i do believe or
[18:18] the answer is yes i do believe that's
[18:20] not a question
[18:21] that's a fact of statement yes i do
[18:23] believe will you either believe or you
[18:25] don't believe
[18:26] was i believe gaza believed but he
[18:28] wasn't looking to the right lens
[18:30] he wasn't looking to the right eyes
[18:32] that's why elijah prayed god
[18:33] open his eyes let him see through the
[18:36] same eyes that i'm looking through
[18:38] let him see what i'm seeing right now
[18:41] and recognize
[18:42] that there's horses and chariots of fire
[18:44] surrounding elisha
[18:45] are with him all the time they never
[18:48] left him
[18:48] they didn't come just because the horses
[18:50] of syria were there
[18:52] they were always there they never left
[18:55] him and if you believe that for him in
[18:57] the scripture
[18:58] and understand what the bible says and
[19:00] the promises for us today you can know
[19:02] the same thing as for you
[19:04] those same ones are there for us right
[19:06] now
[19:07] today they never leave you they don't
[19:10] come just when you're in distress
[19:11] they don't show up just when you're
[19:13] hurting or in pain they don't come
[19:15] just because you have some calamity
[19:18] going on in life they're
[19:19] always there they never leave you so no
[19:22] matter what
[19:23] compass you no matter what the devil
[19:25] tries to come and do to you no matter
[19:27] what he sends through you into your life
[19:29] to try to upset you
[19:31] it doesn't matter because the there
[19:33] always
[19:34] is more with us than there are with them
[19:37] always
[19:38] amen greater is he that's in me than he
[19:40] that is in the world why because
[19:42] we are all he is always there he never
[19:44] leaves us or forsakes us
[19:46] amen
[19:50] my wife's telling me nobody can see it i
[19:52] don't know why it looks like it's fine
[19:55] um to me can everybody hear it okay
[19:59] i only show one connected viewer here
[20:02] is everybody seeing this okay
[20:06] um i don't know it's showing up fine
[20:08] it's showing up fine here i don't know
[20:10] why
[20:10] nobody can see it um
[20:15] well i'm not i'm not sure how to change
[20:17] that or what to do about it
[20:21] it looks fine on my computer it's
[20:23] showing up fine
[20:24] on the stream on the studio it's showing
[20:26] up fine
[20:30] i'm not sure why it's not showing up
[20:33] anyway anybody
[20:37] see it let sonja know uh texture because
[20:40] i'm just gonna keep preaching
[20:41] so at least if you can't see it you can
[20:43] hear it because that's the main thing
[20:45] anyway so
[20:46] sorry this technology i'd rather be in
[20:48] person
[20:50] i always always always i'd rather be in
[20:53] person
[20:54] i don't i don't understand what the
[20:56] problem is here but
[20:57] uh it's working fine in front of me so
[20:59] we're just gonna keep preaching so
[21:01] let's go back to the first of that
[21:03] chapter and you can see me i don't know
[21:05] um but you can hear me hopefully you can
[21:07] hear me if you can hear me that's
[21:09] that's good but um let's go back to the
[21:12] beginning of the sixth chapter
[21:13] amen and the sons of the prophets
[21:16] said unto elisha behold now the place
[21:19] where we dwell with thee
[21:21] is too straight for us and a lot of
[21:23] times the way is too straight for a lot
[21:25] of people today
[21:26] they say they believe but they can't
[21:28] live it the way's too straight
[21:30] let us go we pray thee unto jordan and
[21:32] take thence every man of being and let
[21:34] us make a place there
[21:36] for we may dwell and he answered go ye
[21:39] and one said be content i pray thee and
[21:42] go with thy servants
[21:43] and he answered i will go
[21:46] so he went with them elisha did and when
[21:50] they came to jordan they cut down
[21:52] wood but as one was failing a beam
[21:55] the axe head fell into the water
[21:58] and he cried and said alas master for it
[22:01] was
[22:02] borrowed and and the man of god said
[22:06] where fell it and he showed him the
[22:08] place
[22:09] and he cut down a stick and cast it in
[22:12] thither
[22:13] and the iron did swim
[22:17] now swim is i don't think the axe head
[22:20] grew arms and literally swam i believe
[22:22] this
[22:23] just came to the surface and floated
[22:25] there in the water
[22:26] but since when is iron float
[22:29] since when does an axe head or a piece
[22:31] an iron like that
[22:33] come from the bottom of the river to the
[22:36] top of the water
[22:37] and float if jesus can walk on water
[22:42] if if we with enough faith and the
[22:44] purpose to can walk on water
[22:47] then surely a night piece of iron can
[22:49] swim i mean
[22:51] the body of jesus weighed more than an
[22:52] axe head the body of peter who walked on
[22:55] water
[22:56] weighed more than an axe head what did
[22:58] it take
[22:59] what did it take to bring the buoyancy
[23:01] of that iron from the bottom of that
[23:03] river
[23:03] to the top of the water it took faith
[23:07] it took a surge of faith to believe now
[23:09] this wasn't something that
[23:11] uh that elijah had to go work up or make
[23:13] up he just said well where did he go in
[23:15] and he got a stick me put it in the cast
[23:17] in the water and then the iron came to
[23:19] the surface
[23:20] now why did it take that i don't know
[23:23] why did it have to take a
[23:24] a a stick or a piece of wood or
[23:26] something to throw in the water
[23:27] i don't know i don't know why it would
[23:29] look to be that way all i know is the
[23:31] iron swam
[23:32] because that's what the bible said the
[23:35] iron came to the surface
[23:37] now that helps you understand it wasn't
[23:39] just one circumstance in elijah's life
[23:42] this happened all the time this was
[23:44] something that was a part of elijah's
[23:46] life so those
[23:47] chariots around him those horses and
[23:49] chariots of fire that was around him
[23:51] wasn't just there because of the kings
[23:53] of syria that faith was always there
[23:56] so much so that the iron swamp now you
[23:58] think that's quite an
[23:59] and that's quite an outstanding
[24:02] testimony
[24:03] he said therefore take he uh said he
[24:06] take it up to thee and put it put out
[24:09] the hand and he took it
[24:10] he took the piece of iron out of the
[24:12] water and put it back in
[24:16] it wasn't this is not an allegory friend
[24:19] this is not something that
[24:21] um that's a story this this actually
[24:24] happened
[24:25] this is a piece of iron that floated to
[24:28] the top of the water not like a ship or
[24:30] a boat
[24:31] but just an axe head that had no
[24:34] reason to or buoyancy at all to float
[24:38] came back to the top of the water so he
[24:40] could get it now if it takes
[24:42] what kind of faith does it take to
[24:43] believe let's say for elisha to believe
[24:46] that that iron was going to come back to
[24:47] the top he did this
[24:48] knowing this was going to happen this
[24:51] wasn't a
[24:52] how was your faith day this was a it's
[24:54] going to happen day
[24:56] because it was it was always there he
[24:58] believed it he believed
[25:00] god and god honored his faith and it
[25:03] brought the iron to the surface now
[25:05] what kind of faith it takes for that to
[25:07] happen now
[25:09] if it takes that kind of faith what kind
[25:11] of faith is it going to take
[25:12] for us for for a rapture for a group of
[25:16] international people of all kindreds
[25:18] tongues nations people
[25:20] to to to have a body change to go on a
[25:23] rapture
[25:26] it it just because that defies
[25:29] as much as iron floating defies every
[25:33] law of physics science uh
[25:36] knowledge everything it defies
[25:39] this bride to to go in a rapture alive
[25:42] in her name
[25:43] dead in christ she rises alive and
[25:44] remains to go on a rapture
[25:46] is going to take a a faith greater than
[25:49] believing
[25:50] that a piece of iron can float like that
[25:53] because all of us around the world
[25:57] are gonna take a heavenly fight one day
[26:00] they're gonna go on a rapture
[26:02] well what kind of faith does that got to
[26:03] take it's got to be a rapturing faith
[26:06] a faith that's that that is enough to
[26:09] believe
[26:10] that it's not a how is your faith it is
[26:12] uh
[26:13] my faith is there i believe period
[26:17] i mean you know we stay home for two
[26:20] services because
[26:21] of a false positive and and and that's
[26:24] okay
[26:25] well what happens is if the real crisis
[26:28] hits
[26:29] uh is something even staunch or harder
[26:33] comes and friend harder times are coming
[26:36] uh i'm not painting a bleak picture i'm
[26:38] just talking about the world
[26:40] i'm not talking about the bride i'm
[26:41] saying the world in the world
[26:43] the darkness is just starting to come in
[26:46] in a in a way like it hasn't since the
[26:49] dark ages
[26:51] and it will surpass the dark ages
[26:54] because this is the time for us to move
[26:56] on
[26:57] uh to move upward uh to get out of this
[27:00] world
[27:01] uh it's a whole other time but i don't
[27:03] want to enter into that so
[27:05] maybe lord willing part of the next
[27:06] message next week but anyway
[27:08] let's just stay on understanding this
[27:10] surge of faith
[27:11] so when elijah was there with those men
[27:15] and they all saw that iron float uh what
[27:18] do you think how it was when his uh
[27:20] domicile was covered around surrounded
[27:22] around with the syrian army
[27:25] and knew he knew that they were there
[27:28] for him
[27:29] he knew that it wasn't like they were a
[27:31] mistaken identity
[27:32] it wasn't like they were there for
[27:34] dehaze or anyone else he knew they were
[27:36] there for him
[27:37] but he didn't panic he didn't fret gaza
[27:40] did
[27:40] he was worried to death he said oh
[27:42] master what are we going to do what are
[27:44] we going to do what are we going to do
[27:46] god said god open his eyes
[27:50] let him see there's more with us than
[27:52] there are with them
[27:53] and they opened and he saw those
[27:55] chariots of fires
[27:56] around about elisha amen those chariots
[28:00] of fire that
[28:00] always there and you may not see them
[28:03] friend but they're always there
[28:05] you may not recognize them or know them
[28:07] but they're always there
[28:09] they you may not see them with your
[28:11] natural eye but they are
[28:12] always there many times hopefully
[28:16] you probably feel the presence of those
[28:18] angels you feel the presence of those
[28:20] spirits that are there
[28:22] to keep you and to protect and to watch
[28:24] over that's that's god there
[28:27] watching over his own children now look
[28:29] what happened
[28:30] after god opens gahey's eyes and
[28:33] they see this this great uh uh
[28:37] a surge of faith i guess you could say
[28:39] that that guy
[28:40] that gaheza uh got when god opened his
[28:43] eyes
[28:44] you imagine can you imagine waking up
[28:46] and seeing the syrian army surround you
[28:48] and then can you imagine when god opens
[28:50] your eyes and you can see the chariots
[28:52] and the horses of fire all around you
[28:54] realizing that the mountains were full
[28:56] of them
[28:58] more with us than there are with them
[29:00] that didn't give you a surge of faith
[29:02] i'm sure it gave gays that a surge of
[29:04] faith but look what happens now
[29:07] these uh horses full of horses chariots
[29:09] of fire around about elijah 18 first now
[29:12] and when they came down to him elisha
[29:14] prayed unto the lord and said smite this
[29:17] people i pray thee
[29:18] with blindness and he smote them with
[29:21] blindness
[29:22] according to the word of elisha
[29:25] miracle now not only
[29:28] are these people all around there and
[29:31] they're there for him
[29:33] knowing that the angels of god are all
[29:37] around him more than they are of the
[29:39] syrian army
[29:41] elisha just simply says lord just blind
[29:43] them blind and said they don't know who
[29:45] i
[29:45] am so when they come down here and they
[29:47] get in and they get i'll come to them
[29:49] i'll talk to them
[29:50] but just they won't know who i am blind
[29:53] and the lord smote them with blindness
[29:55] according to whose word
[29:57] elisha's amen faith
[30:00] according to whose word you got to
[30:02] believe this is a
[30:03] this is a this is a a message of faith
[30:07] this is a life of faith this is a
[30:09] speaking of faith
[30:10] believing amen and elisha said unto them
[30:15] this is not the way
[30:16] neither is this the city follow me and i
[30:19] will bring you to the man whom ye seek
[30:21] but he led them to samaria
[30:25] right in the hands of their enemy right
[30:28] in the hands of israel see
[30:29] it came to pass that when they were in
[30:32] coming to samaria that elisha said lord
[30:34] open the eyes of these men that they may
[30:36] see
[30:36] and the lord opened their eyes and they
[30:38] saw and behold
[30:40] they were in the midst of syria can you
[30:42] imagine their surprise
[30:44] the king of israel said unto elijah when
[30:47] he saw them my father
[30:48] shall i smite them shall i smite them
[30:52] and elisha answered thou shalt not smite
[30:55] them wouldest thou smite those
[30:57] whom the thou has taken captive with thy
[31:00] sword and with thy bow
[31:01] set bread and water before them that
[31:03] they may eat and drink and go to their
[31:05] master
[31:05] and he prepared great provisions for
[31:07] them and when they had eaten and drunk
[31:09] he sent them away and they went to their
[31:11] masters so the bands of syria came
[31:14] no more into the land of israel amen
[31:18] that took care of it once and for all
[31:20] because why there was more with them
[31:23] more with him than there was with them
[31:25] there was more with elisha there was
[31:27] more on the believer's side
[31:29] it was more with us than there are with
[31:31] them i know the bible says that in this
[31:33] last day brother barum tells us this 200
[31:36] million
[31:37] demons 200 000 000 demons 200 million
[31:40] demons
[31:40] loosed upon the bride for this last day
[31:43] friend but that
[31:44] hails in comparison to the angelic host
[31:48] that god has in camping us every day
[31:51] every moment you know if there's
[31:54] ever a time that something were to
[31:57] happen
[31:57] and and i've said this to you many times
[32:00] but
[32:01] god watches over his own and if
[32:03] something does happen
[32:04] if something does come up like this we
[32:07] know that it happened for a reason
[32:08] we know that god had to have allowed it
[32:11] and it had to have happened for a reason
[32:12] because
[32:13] nothing would happen to his children
[32:16] that he doesn't orchestrate or allow
[32:18] nothing there's not one thing that can
[32:21] happen
[32:21] look i i've read this scripture to you
[32:24] many times
[32:25] let's go to the book of job let's read
[32:28] here again
[32:29] refresh our memories about job and how
[32:31] job himself was hedged about
[32:34] amen you know that i pray that for you
[32:37] all the time friend i pray that for us
[32:40] for our church
[32:41] for our families for the bride
[32:43] internationally
[32:44] and then you know this cobit thing is an
[32:46] if there's a reason
[32:47] this covet thing is international
[32:51] it's an international thing that's
[32:53] hitting
[32:54] stuff like sarge and some of those
[32:55] things that happened in obama's
[32:57] administration things like that
[32:59] they were they were what they were they
[33:01] were kind of low-level things
[33:02] but this is something that has killed i
[33:05] believe
[33:05] over a million people internationally
[33:08] worldwide this is gripped and uh with
[33:12] fear
[33:13] pretty much every nation on the planet
[33:16] actually
[33:18] but i pray that god keep those angels
[33:21] and chariots of fire
[33:23] around you every day every moment every
[33:26] night and day
[33:27] your entire life protected
[33:30] keeping us i i know
[33:33] because i've heard testimony from you
[33:36] that
[33:37] and and us that's that's actually been
[33:40] around
[33:40] people that have gotten positive tests
[33:42] or showed symptoms
[33:44] and god protected you and god kept you
[33:47] and god blessed you god has watched over
[33:50] us and he still does
[33:53] i'm not saying that you couldn't get it
[33:56] uh sister lydia said she was still
[33:59] showing some symptoms and she didn't
[34:00] want to come to church with everybody
[34:02] until those symptoms were gone and i
[34:04] appreciate that i don't want a cold or
[34:06] flu any more than i won't covet
[34:08] and nobody wants to be sick so i say
[34:11] yeah if you have any symptoms
[34:12] by all means stay at home don't come
[34:15] with a group of people
[34:17] but i believe that god is continuing to
[34:20] bless and to keep his children and to
[34:23] watch over them i'm not saying that
[34:25] you might not get it i'm i'm believing
[34:27] that you won't because i'm believing
[34:29] my prayer my prayer is to keep us
[34:32] protected and
[34:33] and hedged uh so when that
[34:37] germ tries to cross that that break
[34:40] that that line of those angels those
[34:42] angels cut it off
[34:44] and don't allow it to come to you that's
[34:46] what i'm believing
[34:48] in faith so we're standing on that faith
[34:51] but
[34:51] we know that the scripture tells us
[34:55] that god has his people hedged not only
[34:57] was elisha there
[34:59] with those chariots of mountains full of
[35:02] the chariots
[35:03] and angels of fire around about them but
[35:06] look at what god was doing for joe
[35:10] of course job first chapter
[35:13] we won't be too long today so i'm just
[35:15] going to read these few verses here
[35:16] beginning with the sixth verse
[35:18] now there was a day when the sons of god
[35:20] came to present themselves before the
[35:22] lord
[35:23] satan came also among them the lord said
[35:26] unto satan whence cometh thou
[35:28] then satan answered the lord and said
[35:30] from going to and fro in the earth and
[35:32] from walking up and down in it
[35:34] and the lord said unto satan hast thou
[35:36] considered my servant job
[35:38] satan didn't bring up job why did satan
[35:41] not bring up job because he knew it was
[35:42] a futile attempt
[35:44] he doesn't quit he doesn't stop he still
[35:47] does it
[35:48] but he didn't bring up joke god brought
[35:50] up job
[35:51] god said hast thou considered my servant
[35:54] job
[35:55] that there is none like him in the earth
[35:58] a perfect and an upright man
[36:00] one that feareth god and is she with
[36:02] evil or turns aside
[36:04] turns away from evil when evil presented
[36:07] itself
[36:08] job turned aside from it would not
[36:10] engage in it
[36:12] then satan answered the lord and said
[36:14] does job
[36:15] fear god for naught does job fear god
[36:18] for nothing
[36:19] there's a reason what god what satan is
[36:21] saying is god there's a reason why job
[36:23] serves you there's a reason why god
[36:26] why job trusts you and believes you
[36:28] there's a reason why job does that but
[36:30] see
[36:31] what satan doesn't understand because
[36:33] his whole world
[36:34] is based on that this whole world is
[36:36] based on
[36:37] filio at best love where one hand
[36:40] watches the other
[36:41] can't comprehend the fact that the
[36:44] children of god
[36:45] love god simply because he exists
[36:48] period not because he's done something
[36:51] for them or to them
[36:52] or because he's always there or the
[36:55] miracles and all the things
[36:56] we love god we serve god simply for the
[37:00] fact that he exists
[37:01] period we don't need a reason job didn't
[37:05] need a reason to serve god but that's
[37:07] satan's whole
[37:08] mindset if you will uh speaking in the
[37:11] natural vernacular
[37:13] that's his whole mindset oh he serves
[37:16] you because of something no we don't
[37:18] serve god
[37:19] because of something joke didn't serve
[37:21] god because of something
[37:24] job served god because he loved him
[37:26] because he was
[37:27] god and that's it amen that's that's why
[37:31] we serve him
[37:32] we serve him today not because of the
[37:34] things he does but because of who he is
[37:37] he simply exists and our love for him
[37:42] exists because he exists and
[37:45] he exists in us if he exists in us and
[37:48] that love he give us who he
[37:50] is is extended to him simply because he
[37:53] is
[37:54] but now satan is saying job sucks
[37:57] there's a reason why job serves you oh
[37:59] no there's not the devil
[38:02] has that has not thou made a hedge about
[38:05] him
[38:06] that's a surrounding that's a protective
[38:08] bubble if you will
[38:10] people talk about wanting to live in
[38:12] bubbles today i've seen people walk
[38:13] around town
[38:14] and they might as well have a bubble and
[38:16] discover the head to toe anyway
[38:18] and that's okay that's that's all right
[38:21] people you know they need they need to
[38:23] people need to live
[38:24] uh their life uh according to their
[38:27] beliefs and their faith and if that's as
[38:29] far as their faith takes them then
[38:31] okay that that's okay they they live
[38:33] that way
[38:34] but see what satan is recognizing
[38:37] is that those angels of god are around
[38:40] job
[38:42] satan is acknowledging the gods of the
[38:44] hedge
[38:46] a protective surrounding well
[38:50] what was the protective surrounding
[38:52] around elisha
[38:53] it was those angels and those mountains
[38:55] full the bible says
[38:57] surrounding elisha what's the same thing
[39:01] it was around job and
[39:02] satan acknowledges that and satan says
[39:05] you have a hedge about him
[39:07] and his house praise the lord
[39:10] all that he loved his family
[39:13] was hedged as well now were they under
[39:16] the same roof
[39:17] they may have been but our family may
[39:19] not all be under the same roof
[39:21] but they're protected by the same
[39:22] protection because you don't have to be
[39:24] under the same roof this is not a
[39:26] low cow faith this is not a locality
[39:30] a protection those angels are
[39:33] always with him always with us always
[39:36] with you
[39:37] always with our families you believe
[39:40] that
[39:40] faith amen believe that in faith it's
[39:43] that hedge
[39:44] surrounding him and his house and about
[39:47] all that he
[39:48] had on every side in other words
[39:51] i can't get to him i've tried i've sent
[39:54] my minions i've sent my
[39:56] devils i've sent my little demons out
[39:57] there to try to do everything they can
[40:00] and now they've buffeted the sister on
[40:03] the side and a brother on this side
[40:04] they've done this and they've done that
[40:06] but i
[40:06] just can't get to him praise the lord
[40:11] he just can't get to you what is that
[40:15] to get you to doubt to get you to
[40:17] unbelief
[40:18] to get you to go away from what god's
[40:21] promises are to you
[40:23] to take that surge of faith and get you
[40:25] worried about a surgical
[40:27] i'm not worried about a surge of cover
[40:29] friend i'm worried about my life having
[40:31] a surge of faith
[40:33] because i'm ready i'm getting ready i'm
[40:35] trusting god the bible says the bride
[40:37] has made herself ready to get out of
[40:39] here
[40:40] not to get used to it to become common
[40:43] i'm ready to get out of here amen
[40:46] praise the lord my family and all that i
[40:49] have
[40:49] every side that thou has blessed the
[40:53] work of his hands and his substance is
[40:55] increased in his hand
[40:56] in in the land but put forth our hand
[40:59] now
[40:59] touch all that he had that he will curse
[41:01] thee did i face again
[41:03] there's a reason job servants should god
[41:05] as satan's reasoning
[41:06] there's a reason why i search it you
[41:08] take all that away from him and he'll
[41:10] curse you
[41:11] he won't serve you anymore see and then
[41:14] there's there
[41:15] there are people like that there's
[41:17] people that come to god and they say
[41:18] they've accepted him as their savior and
[41:20] they say they believe him they live for
[41:21] them and they go to church and they act
[41:23] and they
[41:23] do all the pomp and circumstance of a
[41:25] religious act and
[41:27] they become and join a denomination
[41:29] message or otherwise
[41:31] denominations of spirit friend a spirit
[41:34] uh it might have a title over it but
[41:36] it's just a spirit
[41:38] that spirit is in the message as much as
[41:40] it is anywhere no the message will not
[41:41] denominate
[41:43] the man said it wouldn't but the spirit
[41:44] of denominations around that
[41:46] around this message and that spirit
[41:48] comes so it doesn't matter
[41:50] whether that's got a name on it or
[41:53] whatever
[41:54] that spirit comes around and says and
[41:56] there's a lot of people that do that
[41:58] and as soon as the trouble hits and as
[42:00] soon as the trials hit as soon as the
[42:01] hard times hit
[42:02] as soon as there's a there's a
[42:04] temptation or something and i don't know
[42:06] where they go
[42:07] because that love was not actually there
[42:10] that spirit was not actually there
[42:12] that actual protection of god
[42:16] was was not there because
[42:19] they never really believed it may have
[42:22] looked like it sounded like it felt like
[42:24] it
[42:24] played the part blended right in but
[42:27] when that when the trial comes what do
[42:29] they do
[42:30] so yeah there are people that serve god
[42:33] on condition
[42:34] but they're not really serving god those
[42:36] aren't really god's children god's
[42:38] children don't serve god on condition
[42:39] they serve him because they love him
[42:41] period you exist if you're a child of
[42:44] god because
[42:45] of him period we are his children
[42:48] you read the bible you see in first in
[42:51] matthew the first chapter
[42:52] god said jesus said he come to save
[42:54] those that were his
[42:56] he come for his children amen i i
[42:59] had that little snippet of a midweek
[43:01] message there on our website
[43:03] his people that's what it says he came
[43:05] to seek and save
[43:06] his people and not the whole world
[43:10] uh i'm not responsible for my next door
[43:12] neighbor's
[43:13] car in the parking lot but i am
[43:15] responsible for mine
[43:16] i'm not responsible for uh the man down
[43:19] the street's wife but i am responsible
[43:21] for mine
[43:22] i'm not responsible for their life but i
[43:24] am responsible for mine
[43:26] god's responsible for his and his own
[43:30] and that's who he is responsible those
[43:31] who the ones that he has hedged
[43:34] that he has protected that are his own
[43:37] that belong to him
[43:38] and they and he loves them and they love
[43:40] him and we serve him
[43:42] because period there's there well there
[43:45] is no because just because he is
[43:47] no way the way to say it is hey because
[43:49] but it's because of that protection
[43:51] that god give us that we know it's there
[43:53] he doesn't have to do it but he does it
[43:55] because he loves us
[43:57] uh just like when our children were
[43:58] growing up we kept them protected
[44:00] because they were ours they belong to us
[44:03] and now they they they're out living
[44:05] their lives and
[44:06] they have god in their lives and god and
[44:08] the children
[44:09] grandchildren see and so uh they
[44:12] they live their lives in that and then
[44:14] the angels of god are encamped around
[44:16] about them
[44:17] and now their protection is there and
[44:20] now satan can come and do the exact same
[44:22] thing as he
[44:22] does with us all the time as he does
[44:24] with you all the time as he does with
[44:26] our family
[44:26] and say oh i can't get to him because
[44:28] you got him hedged well praise the lord
[44:31] well if we're all hedged then the only
[44:33] way that satan can even try to get to
[44:34] you is if god allows them
[44:36] and if god allows them there's a reason
[44:37] for it there's a reason
[44:39] say the lord why what what did i do
[44:43] what do i need to do where would you
[44:46] have me go from here lord just
[44:47] strengthen me in this trial
[44:49] whatever it is because we'll be closer
[44:51] to him when it's all done
[44:52] said and done at the end of it now this
[44:55] uh one more scripture i want to read to
[44:57] you
[44:58] before i close uh but i want to but i
[45:00] want to read this quote to you i wasn't
[45:02] going to do this but i'm going to do it
[45:03] anyway
[45:04] because brother branham said it so uh
[45:07] you
[45:07] you take it for what he said you can
[45:09] listen to the whole message
[45:11] i don't intend to take this out of
[45:13] context and understand this was
[45:15] 1954. a lot of things that came up in
[45:18] brother brown's life that god revealed
[45:20] to brother branham and things
[45:21] after 1954 but this is a very prevalent
[45:24] uh quote for today so listen he said
[45:26] what is cancer
[45:28] what is a disease we'll deal on that for
[45:31] the next five minutes now what is cancer
[45:33] what's causing that thing let's take a
[45:35] cancer
[45:36] anything you wish to take tuberculosis
[45:38] pneumonia whatever you wish to
[45:40] any disease diseases are germs
[45:45] let me pass something here quickly as
[45:47] our time's going
[45:48] listen did you know the bible predicts
[45:51] or says
[45:52] not really a prediction it's a prophecy
[45:54] the bible
[45:55] uh says prophet prophesies predicts that
[45:58] in the last days that there will be a
[46:00] drum warfare
[46:01] i'm not saying that the covet is a
[46:03] german warfare it could very well be
[46:05] a part of the beginning of that because
[46:07] listen
[46:08] there'll be a german warfare that
[46:11] diseases will break out upon the people
[46:14] and will fall on everyone without the
[46:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[46:19] think about that but with the angel or
[46:22] who had charged over these plagues was
[46:24] given orders to touch
[46:26] no one on whom the mark was why
[46:29] how much uh kind of teachers have we got
[46:32] to be
[46:32] brethren to get the church in order in
[46:35] that condition
[46:36] immune now remember what we said a
[46:38] couple weeks ago the last service at the
[46:40] church
[46:41] in revelation 6 when you get revelation
[46:44] 6 i believe verse 4 jesus comes out of
[46:47] the midst of those four beasts and says
[46:49] you can take the wealth of the world
[46:51] you can do what you want to your people
[46:53] but don't you touch my people
[46:55] don't you touch the oil and wine well
[46:57] that's exactly what brother graham's
[46:59] talking about here
[47:00] he's saying that yeah these things are
[47:02] going to break out and they're going to
[47:03] fall out across the world
[47:05] internationally and those diseases will
[47:09] break out upon
[47:10] everybody without the baptism of the
[47:12] holy ghost
[47:13] but now look what he says he says but
[47:16] with the angel
[47:17] and this this and i tell you this to
[47:19] inspire me
[47:20] in my ministry the ministry that's his
[47:23] ministry
[47:24] the lord give but um but but this this
[47:27] one sentence this phrase here he said
[47:28] but the angel
[47:30] or who had charge over these plagues was
[47:33] given orders
[47:34] to touch no to touch no one on whom the
[47:37] mark
[47:38] was why why
[47:41] how much kind of teachers
[47:45] have we got to be brother what kind of
[47:48] ministers what kind of
[47:49] teachers pastors preachers have we got
[47:52] to be brothers
[47:53] to get this church in order to be in
[47:56] that condition
[47:58] the ministers the godly holy ghost
[48:00] five-fold ministry
[48:02] that preached the pure unadulterated
[48:04] word of this hour to
[48:06] get the bride of jesus christ in a place
[48:09] in a condition that this fits them
[48:13] immune he says
[48:16] immune diminished the word remember we
[48:19] talk we
[48:20] we talked about this couple weeks ago
[48:22] the the faith comes by hearing and
[48:24] hearing the word of god
[48:25] and bringing faith upon the people
[48:28] through the pure word of god minister to
[48:30] a group of people
[48:31] internationally to get that group of
[48:33] people in a place of rapturing faith
[48:36] to get that church in that condition
[48:38] immune
[48:40] immune what is bringing the immunity
[48:43] it's not just the holy spirit but it's
[48:46] your faith
[48:48] it's your faith in believing that god
[48:51] has you
[48:52] hedged and protected and he's watching
[48:55] over you
[48:56] 24 7 all the time
[48:59] not just when you have to go get a test
[49:02] not just when you feel a symptom not
[49:04] just when there's some kind of calamity
[49:06] all the time those angels are with you
[49:08] all the time what kind of
[49:10] preachers what kind of message have we
[49:12] got to bring to you
[49:14] to raise our faith to that place
[49:17] to get us in the place of faith so that
[49:20] we'll stand in the face of that
[49:22] covet or anything else and said you're a
[49:24] lying devil
[49:26] you've got no place in me my wife my
[49:29] family or
[49:30] anybody that i choose is my my house
[49:33] that's hedged
[49:34] you have no place here god help us
[49:38] help us to somehow
[49:42] live and preach and believe that faith
[49:45] to that place
[49:46] immune immune now this is god's provided
[49:50] way of healing
[49:51] july 19 1954 you want to look it up and
[49:54] read it yourself
[49:56] my arms are so sore now he says from
[49:59] where the doctors has punched needles in
[50:01] to try to inoculate me from yellow fever
[50:04] and so forth
[50:04] and brother branham you know he had to
[50:06] take those because he went overseas all
[50:08] the time you go overseas they require
[50:10] those inoculations they have to
[50:12] have documentation to show
[50:16] i've had this immunization before they
[50:17] can go over into foreign countries or
[50:19] they can come here
[50:20] they have to be immunized so brother
[50:23] branham had to take it
[50:24] they said my arm is sore now for taking
[50:26] this he said i
[50:28] told them i didn't need it but they
[50:30] wouldn't listen to me
[50:33] it sounds a lot like today i guess but
[50:36] brother battle at that time
[50:37] his arm was sore from taking the
[50:39] inoculations yellow fever and so forth
[50:41] he said i told him i didn't need it but
[50:43] they wouldn't listen to me
[50:45] amen but i'll tell you what god's going
[50:48] to do
[50:48] god's got a serum and it's called the
[50:51] holy ghost
[50:52] and when that serum goes in it'll
[50:55] inoculate you
[50:56] praise the lord hallelujah he says for
[50:59] these last days
[51:00] it'll inoculate you praise now that that
[51:03] doesn't help give us a surge of faith to
[51:05] realize those who are
[51:07] listening to this that are born again
[51:10] and filled with his spirit and how the
[51:11] holy ghost living
[51:12] in you through you you recognize and
[51:15] realize
[51:16] god's talking about you this is you this
[51:18] is us
[51:20] help us lord with the faith as i try to
[51:23] verbalize this the best i can
[51:24] what's in my heart and spirit right now
[51:26] to get to you friend at that ministry to
[51:28] bring that faith to a people
[51:30] to understand that satan cannot touch
[51:33] you
[51:33] not without god's permission cannot
[51:35] touch you
[51:36] amen can't touch you wisdom no wisdom
[51:39] whatever it is
[51:40] i'm not i don't worry about that can't
[51:42] touch you
[51:44] one more one more scripture i want to
[51:46] read to you psalms 34. i
[51:50] might could have guessed where i was
[51:52] going to go for my last scripture
[51:53] psalms 34. begin with verse 1
[51:57] psalms 34 1 we'll close here after this
[52:00] he said i will bless the lord at all
[52:02] times his
[52:02] prey shall continually be in my mouth
[52:06] my soul shall make her boast in the lord
[52:08] the humble shall hear thereof and be
[52:10] glad
[52:11] o magnify the lord with me and let us
[52:14] exalt his name together
[52:17] i sought the lord and he heard me and
[52:19] delivered me from all my fears
[52:22] delivered me from all my fears i am
[52:25] delivered
[52:26] from the fear of the devil
[52:30] they looked unto him and were lightened
[52:33] and their faces were not ashamed this
[52:35] poor man
[52:36] cried and the lord heard him and saved
[52:38] him out of all of his troubles
[52:40] the angel of the lord encampeth round
[52:43] about them that
[52:45] fear him and delivereth them
[52:48] old taste and see what the lord o tastes
[52:51] and see
[52:52] that the lord is good blessed is the man
[52:55] that trusteth in him
[52:57] why because we know again
[53:01] david says here in the scripture the
[53:04] angel of god
[53:05] encampeth about us all the time
[53:08] it didn't again it wasn't just because
[53:12] those syrians had come to elisha
[53:15] those angels were always there they
[53:18] don't leave on vacation
[53:20] they don't go on lunch breaks they don't
[53:22] even take
[53:23] naps they're always there they are
[53:26] always in encamped around about us
[53:29] they're always there with you whether
[53:30] you can see them with the act
[53:32] natural i or not believe it by faith it
[53:35] takes that surge of faith to know that
[53:36] they are there
[53:38] i had somebody say so you know you know
[53:41] we're protected and catch it and and all
[53:44] and i know we stay away from people
[53:46] friend you're not catching because you
[53:47] stay away from people you're not
[53:48] catching it because god's protecting you
[53:50] that's why you're not catching it that's
[53:52] why god's with you and keeping you from
[53:54] it
[53:56] because god's watching over you and
[53:58] that's my prayer to you that's my
[54:00] standing in the gap for you as a
[54:02] congregation
[54:03] holding back and trusting that the faith
[54:05] the prayer of faith
[54:07] is saving it is protecting amen yes
[54:11] god's a healer but the angels of god are
[54:14] keeping us protected
[54:16] from from the things and it takes a
[54:19] surge it takes up faith to believe
[54:21] that that god is keeping us and
[54:24] protecting us
[54:25] and helping us and it's not just my
[54:27] prayer it's all of our prayer together
[54:29] we pray together pray you one for the
[54:31] other see we all pray together
[54:34] not for healing we're not looking to
[54:35] healing now we have prayer requests and
[54:37] we
[54:37] first need healing time protection i'm
[54:40] talking about god keeping us
[54:42] those angels watching over us that hedge
[54:44] that's around us
[54:46] angel of god and camping around about us
[54:51] doing away with the fear now you notice
[54:54] there in that passage there's two
[54:55] fears there's the original fear which is
[54:58] which is a a a a torment fear
[55:02] uh which is from the devil the second
[55:04] fear is the angel of the lord and camp
[55:06] round about those that fear him that's
[55:08] the reverence and love that we have
[55:10] towards god
[55:11] as is two different fears let's use the
[55:13] same word one's for poor men
[55:15] and the other is to bring faith see
[55:17] reverence
[55:18] that we fear the lord that we trust him
[55:20] and believe him
[55:21] and that's our faith towards him that we
[55:23] believe god's keeping you
[55:25] god's watching over god's blessing us
[55:27] god's providing for us
[55:29] what we have need of god is always there
[55:32] believe
[55:33] that search of faith that surge of faith
[55:35] is there for you i'm going to believe it
[55:37] and forget about the search of hope
[55:40] that's that's
[55:41] i'm not i'm not concerned about that i'm
[55:44] concerned about god's protection and
[55:46] watching over and keeping us
[55:48] i mean i've known people men of
[55:51] men of god children of god i've known
[55:54] some like brother jim and brother joel's
[55:57] passed away from it that were that were
[55:59] godly men and i believe them to be
[56:01] and love them but then and there's a
[56:03] reason why that happened
[56:04] i don't know why i can't explain it but
[56:07] i believe what i pray
[56:08] and i believe what i pray for my family
[56:10] and i believe what i pray for my
[56:12] children
[56:13] for my church and i believe that and we
[56:15] pray and believe for one another and
[56:17] and trust god in that amen i believe
[56:20] god's hand is upon you
[56:22] let's let that surge of faith take a
[56:24] hold of the bride
[56:25] because there's nothing but a surge of
[56:27] fear that's taking hold this world
[56:29] taking a hold of this country you know a
[56:31] lot of the things that's happened has
[56:33] been things that
[56:34] we talk about as far as our country
[56:36] united states from but this is something
[56:37] that's
[56:38] that's an international thing and it's
[56:41] got and it has to take something
[56:42] international to bring in an
[56:44] international
[56:45] um counter to it
[56:49] and not only that but it's got to take
[56:51] an international
[56:53] uniting of god's ride because this
[56:57] rapture is an international rapture
[57:00] this is a bringing together of god's
[57:01] children and we're going to go
[57:03] to meet him meet the lord in the air i'd
[57:06] be honest with you probably more than
[57:09] ever and i've been preaching this for
[57:10] years i'm more anticipation of seeing my
[57:14] loved ones appear at any time than i
[57:15] have ever been in my life
[57:17] can feel that pull uh greater than i've
[57:20] ever felt in my life i believe it gets
[57:22] stronger
[57:23] i believe it will as this time continues
[57:25] to march forward
[57:26] you look at our nation we got an
[57:27] inauguration coming up wednesday friend
[57:30] and the only thing i can believe i hope
[57:32] it's not true
[57:33] the only thing i can believe is the man
[57:35] that's getting in there
[57:36] is going to follow in the footsteps of
[57:38] the man that he was the vice president
[57:40] for who was a
[57:41] hater of israel turned this nation
[57:44] against israel for eight years
[57:47] fortunately we had four years of a
[57:49] president that loved israel and made it
[57:50] israel
[57:51] showed his alliance with israel and
[57:53] blessed israel and we know the scripture
[57:55] that when you bless israel god blesses
[57:58] you
[57:58] you curse israel god curses you this
[58:02] nation is about to start
[58:03] cursing israel again friend
[58:07] well we know what's in store for it so
[58:10] uh but we trust and believe that god is
[58:13] taking care of us
[58:14] there's some tremendous transition
[58:18] happening
[58:19] right now but the greatest transition
[58:21] i'm looking for is a translation
[58:23] and that's this bride go home so amen
[58:27] pray the lord bless you today appreciate
[58:29] you watching being here or listening
