[10:42] brother dennis and brother danny both
[10:44] tested positive for coping
[10:46] [Music]
[10:47] i don't think a whole lot about it but
[10:48] they tested
[10:50] positive for it but they're both doing
[10:51] fine they're doing well brother danny
[10:53] had very little symptoms neither one of
[10:55] them according to brother dennis even
[10:57] had a fever
[10:58] brother danny's uh really just had a
[11:00] little bit of congestion he's doing
[11:03] doing fine their quarantine time is
[11:05] supposed to be over tomorrow so they
[11:07] stay home again watching hopefully
[11:08] they're streaming god bless you brothers
[11:10] hope you are streaming um and brother
[11:13] dennis i think brother dennis got it a
[11:15] little more than brother danny maybe he
[11:17] had a little more symptoms the doctor
[11:18] said he had the beginning stages of
[11:20] pneumonia but he's taking some
[11:22] um i forgot what it was uh that the
[11:26] doctor prescribed to him but it's one of
[11:27] those medicines they talk about all the
[11:29] time uh with the covet uh it's not uh
[11:33] it's not hydroxychloroquine or
[11:35] ivermectin it's something else i forgot
[11:36] the name of it but anyway
[11:38] uh but he's doing fine they're both
[11:40] doing well thank god for their healing
[11:43] and for touching them and blessing them
[11:45] but that's they're uh probably might
[11:47] still would have been here but uh the
[11:49] the coveted restriction thing they
[11:51] decided to stay home today and they have
[11:52] my full support in that so appreciate
[11:55] them um
[11:56] uh and
[11:57] just that's why they're not with us
[11:59] today brother angel sent me a
[12:02] rather lengthy text um
[12:06] that uh
[12:07] their family is going through some
[12:09] issues you know her sister priscilla is
[12:11] home
[12:12] she's having some problems the with the
[12:14] medicine she has to wake up every couple
[12:16] hours to take the medicine she's on
[12:19] which of course you all know all about
[12:21] joel
[12:22] the medicine she's on but she's only
[12:24] supposed to be on the medicine for
[12:25] another uh couple of days three more
[12:28] days so hopefully that'll be over but
[12:31] she's having anxiety eating
[12:33] uh
[12:35] even to the point that she becomes
[12:36] nervous shaking eating i guess because
[12:39] of the situation that she just went
[12:41] through uh went through also
[12:44] he said she's been having some bad pain
[12:46] on her lower right side
[12:49] and they're supposed to go tomorrow to
[12:50] the surgeon to find out what uh what
[12:52] that might be and give her a checkup
[12:55] uh also brother angel confessed he's
[12:58] battling some anger issues he says he's
[13:00] not lashing out at anybody but he just
[13:03] feels uh anger just the world and the
[13:06] things the way they are the sin of the
[13:07] world and
[13:08] um
[13:10] the sin that's everywhere that's just
[13:11] really i guess getting the best of him
[13:14] i guess i could confess sometimes it
[13:15] does me too
[13:17] i don't get angry i get happy
[13:19] because i'm thankful because the worse
[13:21] the world gets the closer we get home
[13:24] that's the way i have to look at it uh
[13:26] you know when we talked about and i've
[13:28] confessed this to some of my family but
[13:30] you know we i may have said it here i
[13:32] can't remember anyway
[13:33] i never realized that when we talked
[13:35] about lord i want to be a part of that
[13:36] rapture group that alive and remain lord
[13:39] i want to be one of the ones who see the
[13:40] body change the resurrection of the dead
[13:43] and go in a rapture without tasting
[13:44] death didn't realize that that was going
[13:46] to cause us to be here at the most
[13:49] cruel wicked time that the earth has
[13:51] ever experienced
[13:53] so
[13:55] you get both
[13:56] amen if we want to be here at that
[13:58] period of time we got to understand that
[14:00] the world is going to be in the worst
[14:02] condition that it's ever going to be in
[14:05] outside of the tribulation after the
[14:06] bride leaves of course it goes into
[14:08] apostasy after that but uh so we got to
[14:11] take both sides of it so when i see this
[14:13] and i feel that i think god that just
[14:16] means we're that much closer home
[14:19] amen i try to look at things and even in
[14:22] the
[14:23] physical world and the political world
[14:25] and i think how horrible things are
[14:27] going and how bad the country is getting
[14:28] and i think lord that's just
[14:30] one more step closer to you yes i mean
[14:33] that
[14:34] other than that it just drive you crazy
[14:36] it just drive you mad if you looked at
[14:38] everything that's going on and you put
[14:40] weight on all those things and looked at
[14:42] it that way it would just drive me crazy
[14:44] but i look at it i say god thank you
[14:47] because i to me i just believe that gets
[14:49] us one more step closer to him
[14:51] amen one more step closer to home but
[14:53] please pray for brother angel sister
[14:55] priscilla kids
[14:57] um
[14:59] brother um
[15:00] the angel said that the satan's really
[15:01] attacking the children too so
[15:04] uh we'll just remember them in prayer
[15:05] the lord would just keep his hand upon
[15:07] them and touch and be with them
[15:10] i don't see the paths here today

[35:56] let's stand to our feet if we could
[36:00] amen we'll turn our bibles to genesis
[36:02] chapter seven
[36:08] genesis chapter seven last week i left
[36:10] off with
[36:12] mentioning to you something that the
[36:14] lord had put on my heart as i was in
[36:16] here praying saturday
[36:18] and
[36:19] most of you know i most of the time or i
[36:20] try to unless something else comes up
[36:24] i spend some port as part of every
[36:26] saturday in here
[36:28] usually
[36:29] most all day saturday
[36:31] but
[36:33] uh something came on my heart um that i
[36:36] mentioned to you before we dismiss
[36:39] service uh last sunday
[36:41] and uh
[36:43] thought that maybe the lord would have
[36:45] me to delve into it a little deeper and
[36:48] so yesterday he did so uh well during
[36:50] the week but especially yesterday so
[36:55] that's what the lord willing we're going
[36:56] to try to bring today but before we do
[36:59] let's just fire our heads for another
[37:00] word of prayer
[37:02] lord jesus
[37:03] father we thank you again for this
[37:05] service we thank you for this time we
[37:07] thank you for giving us lord the desire
[37:09] in our heart to be in the house of god
[37:11] for those who weren't able to make it
[37:13] may be streaming today lord we thank you
[37:15] for your presence in our lives and for
[37:17] watching over protecting us and bringing
[37:19] us to this place in this time today lord
[37:22] no doubt another time that you give us
[37:24] and and a time lord that we'll never
[37:26] meet again just like this lord and we
[37:28] don't know what this might be the last
[37:29] time we ever meet together like this
[37:32] lord there we are that close we know we
[37:34] believe
[37:35] lord that we're getting to that point in
[37:37] time
[37:37] lord the
[37:39] the squeezing down if you will lord of
[37:42] the things that's going on in this world
[37:44] in this country this freedom of religion
[37:46] that we have
[37:47] christianity is being squeezed out lord
[37:50] and so are its people which is your
[37:52] people and lord god we're trusting in
[37:55] you
[37:56] before we can be completely shut out god
[37:58] you're going to take us home because as
[38:01] we're being pushed out of this world
[38:02] we're being pushed towards you and whom
[38:05] god is where we desire to be and we
[38:08] trust you lord to to
[38:11] as you fulfill the promise of your word
[38:12] to bring us to that point in time
[38:15] help us lord to continue to let go of
[38:18] ourselves to let go of our ideas our
[38:20] opinions thoughts
[38:21] lord to let go of anything that would
[38:23] hinder us from being molded and shaped
[38:26] into your image by you
[38:28] help us lord that this word god would
[38:30] not return void but find this place in
[38:32] the heart of your people today
[38:35] we thank you lord for all that you do
[38:36] for us all the wonderful testimonies we
[38:38] heard lord and all the prayer requests
[38:40] that we had that tomorrow are going to
[38:42] be testimonies lord we thank you for
[38:45] them we committed all to your hands and
[38:47] give you praise honoring glory lord in
[38:50] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[38:52] pray amen
[38:54] amen genesis chapter 7 i want to read
[38:57] three verses beginning with the 13th
[38:59] verse genesis 7 13
[39:02] in the self-same day entered noah and
[39:05] shem and ham and japheth the sons of
[39:07] noah and noah's wife and the three wives
[39:10] of his sons with them into the ark they
[39:14] and every beast after his kind and all
[39:16] the cattle after their kind and every
[39:18] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[39:20] earth after his kind and every fowl
[39:22] after his kind every bird of every sword
[39:26] and they went into uh they went in unto
[39:29] noah into the ark two and two
[39:32] uh of all flesh wherein is the breath of
[39:35] life
[39:35] and they that went in when in male and
[39:38] female of all flesh is god had commanded
[39:41] him and the lord shut him in
[39:44] amen you can be seated if you'd like
[39:49] for those who may not have remembered
[39:51] last week when we finished off the
[39:52] service
[39:54] i mentioned to you a thought that the
[39:55] lord had put on my heart with all the
[39:57] things that's going on and
[39:58] you know so many things and so many
[40:00] times the lord does things and and we
[40:03] don't understand them and sometimes we
[40:04] may never understand them sometimes the
[40:06] lord may give us a little insight or
[40:08] show us a little something and uh i'm
[40:11] just believing that that's something
[40:12] that the lord put on my heart that maybe
[40:14] that could be a portion of what's going
[40:16] on but i mentioned the the
[40:19] the two words last week uh that the lord
[40:21] had given me when i was in prayer last
[40:23] saturday and that was the final
[40:25] preparations
[40:26] because i started again
[40:28] especially after brother charlie passed
[40:30] again i started thinking and and
[40:33] and looking at that
[40:35] as as we've considered the how many
[40:38] people are passing now
[40:40] it's really in my lifetime i've only
[40:42] lived 56 years but in my lifetime i
[40:44] can't remember a time when there's been
[40:47] so many people passing that i know of
[40:50] christians
[40:51] godly people people i
[40:53] believe to be my brothers and sisters
[40:55] holy ghost filled people
[40:57] from all different varieties of course
[40:59] covets hit the land and
[41:01] they say that covet has claimed the
[41:03] lives of many but there's been a lot of
[41:04] people that i know that have gone on and
[41:06] it wasn't code yes but for different
[41:09] reasons uh it just seems like there's
[41:11] just been an inordinate amount of people
[41:14] that are continuing to pass on
[41:16] and it it made me
[41:19] contemplate it made me start thinking
[41:21] praying talking to the lord maybe why
[41:24] this is going on lord why is this
[41:26] happening why now
[41:27] are these things taking place i mean i
[41:29] thought about it i prayed about it me
[41:31] and brother rogers discussed it and our
[41:33] thoughts about it and you know without a
[41:35] scriptural precedent without a an
[41:37] emphatic prophet
[41:39] prophetic utterance we don't really know
[41:42] uh
[41:44] all i can do is believe what i feel the
[41:46] lord put on my heart and that was the
[41:49] final preparations
[41:50] that was what the lord had put on my
[41:52] heart the other day i expressed that
[41:54] with you last sunday the final
[41:56] preparations of what's going on in the
[41:58] world today and there comes that time
[42:01] when with every major event and i'll go
[42:04] through a couple of events that we see
[42:06] in in the scripture
[42:08] uh major events that god
[42:10] does things to bring people to the place
[42:13] of being prepared
[42:15] but he also has this period of time and
[42:17] usually that period of time scripturally
[42:20] is a very short period of time so if
[42:22] we've entered into that to that point of
[42:26] of what's going on right now our god's
[42:28] final preparations scripturally from
[42:31] what i could find
[42:32] that period of time is a very short
[42:35] period now the preparation period could
[42:37] take years i mean we just read about
[42:40] noah and the ark it took noah 120 years
[42:44] to build the ark as the scripture
[42:46] discusses 120 years to build this ark
[42:49] and and that's a long time i mean that's
[42:52] longer than any of us will live that's
[42:54] longer than anybody i've known in my
[42:56] life to live maybe there's been a couple
[42:58] of people that are around the world over
[43:00] the past 50 years that have lived maybe
[43:02] a little older than 120 but 120 years is
[43:05] a long period of time but that was the
[43:08] preparation period but the finalization
[43:11] of those preparations was a very very
[43:14] concise short period of time and if
[43:17] we've entered into that period of time
[43:19] we're in that that that final that stage
[43:22] of final preparation then his friends
[43:25] it's not going to be much longer
[43:27] i uh you know preparations can take
[43:30] years months years uh but that that last
[43:33] part
[43:34] uh actually shuts it down to just in
[43:37] just a very short period of time now the
[43:40] word preparation which i found
[43:43] unusual to me
[43:44] uh because i looked it up just the
[43:46] webster's dictionary definition
[43:49] something done listen to this now this
[43:51] is not this is not final preparation
[43:53] this is just preparations
[43:56] so preparation
[43:59] is something that is done
[44:01] to get ready
[44:03] for an event
[44:04] or undertaking
[44:07] so preparation is something that is done
[44:10] to make ready
[44:12] for an event
[44:14] that's what a preparation is for now
[44:16] when god gave noah god came to the to
[44:20] the point of repentance that he made man
[44:22] he come to the point that that the world
[44:24] was corrupt and violent
[44:26] uh in in
[44:28] chapter 16
[44:30] um
[44:33] let's see in verse 12 it said god looked
[44:35] upon the earth and behold it was corrupt
[44:38] the earth was corrupt and for all flesh
[44:42] had corrupted his way upon the earth
[44:46] god said in north the end of flesh has
[44:47] come before me for the earth is filled
[44:50] with violence
[44:52] through them and behold i will destroy
[44:54] the earth now that violence if you look
[44:57] that up in the hebrew it says injustices
[45:01] the world had become so unjust unjust
[45:06] violence
[45:07] uh that that injustice began to
[45:10] infiltrate into everybody's everyday
[45:13] normal life
[45:15] uh it was strange because me and uh
[45:19] brother roger did a job the other day
[45:21] and these people were describing to us
[45:24] uh something that they had done or a
[45:26] family member had done and and they they
[45:29] did what they did
[45:31] where they did it i don't want to go
[45:33] into the details but they did it because
[45:35] they wanted to make sure
[45:38] that how they did it it would not get
[45:40] stolen
[45:41] or or vandalized or destroyed
[45:45] and i and we got the van i told brother
[45:47] roger i said it's a horrible shame
[45:50] that we have to conduct our lives in the
[45:52] manner that one of the first things we
[45:55] think about is making sure how and where
[45:57] we do it is where nobody's going to
[46:00] steal it or destroy it
[46:02] it's sad that that has to be a
[46:04] consideration you know when i was a kid
[46:06] that wasn't consideration i mean there
[46:08] was violence of course in the earth in
[46:10] the country it was violence and things
[46:12] like that and robberies and injustice
[46:14] but it's gotten to the place that it
[46:16] affects
[46:17] really it seems like
[46:19] except maybe a godly holy ghost-filled
[46:22] christian it affects their everyday life
[46:26] one time we we had some stuff stolen out
[46:28] of a out of a storage unit and and it
[46:31] was kind of partly my fault but i told
[46:34] my wife i said
[46:35] i don't think like a criminal
[46:38] when you don't think like a criminal you
[46:40] don't think that this is going to be
[46:42] prime real estate for a criminal to to
[46:45] plunder
[46:46] to steal you just don't think like that
[46:49] people used to leave their doors home
[46:51] people used to leave there i know people
[46:53] used to where i lived people used to
[46:54] leave their keys in their car overnight
[46:56] the door unlocked right
[46:58] left their home doors unlocked
[47:01] but it's gotten to the place now
[47:03] not only have we gone past that but
[47:06] we've gotten to the place that people's
[47:08] minds are so consumed with the violence
[47:10] the unjustice that
[47:13] even when they think about doing a
[47:15] normal everyday thing they have to
[47:17] consider the violence
[47:20] the the theft the violent aspect of it
[47:23] and it's sad that it's got to that place
[47:25] but that's the place it's gotten
[47:27] well god destroyed the earth here and
[47:30] god's about to do the same thing again
[47:32] now he promised not to do it by water
[47:33] but he's going to do it by fire so he
[47:36] did it once he's going to do it again so
[47:38] if we look at the scriptural precedent
[47:40] of what god did when he did it the first
[47:43] time i believe that we can look at that
[47:45] and
[47:46] understand that that might be a
[47:49] prescription that we can look at for
[47:51] what he's going to do again
[47:53] and when you look at what's going on a
[47:55] lot of it really does tend to
[47:57] fall into place
[47:59] when you recognize what is what it's
[48:01] doing now
[48:02] when when this came to god when god
[48:05] i'll say come to the realization but
[48:07] just talking normal
[48:09] when god began to discuss this with noah
[48:12] god told noah that's it's corrupt and
[48:15] violent so i'm going to destroy the
[48:17] earth but i found favor with you noah so
[48:20] i'm going to spare you and your family
[48:22] and i want you and your family uh to be
[48:25] to be saved and and all these animals
[48:27] that he chose see two of every one all
[48:30] the creeping things the the birds the
[48:32] animals the male the female of everyone
[48:34] to come into this place of safety
[48:37] and this place of safety is going to be
[48:39] what i tell you it's going to be noah
[48:41] and i want you to do this i want you to
[48:43] build it this way and this way and use
[48:45] this wood and use this pitch and do it
[48:47] exactly this way in this dimensions and
[48:49] this high and i want i don't want all of
[48:52] my instructions to be followed to a t
[48:54] noah and noah followed god's
[48:56] instructions perfectly right
[48:59] amen just like i believe that we today
[49:02] should follow god's instructions
[49:04] perfectly
[49:05] we don't need to add our ideas in here
[49:07] right we don't need to put our opinions
[49:09] in here we don't need to try to alter it
[49:11] to fit what we think it will be we don't
[49:13] need to try to get rid of the old
[49:15] testament they're trying to justify our
[49:17] little pet doctrines no we need to
[49:19] follow it exactly the way god gave it to
[49:22] us
[49:23] and exactly the way god gave it to noah
[49:25] god followed
[49:27] noah followed god's instructions exactly
[49:29] the way god told him to
[49:31] and that was why it sustained the storm
[49:34] when the storm hit now we know noah was
[49:36] the type of the other foolish virgin
[49:38] that goes over the tribulation through
[49:40] the tribulation period and come out on
[49:42] the other side
[49:44] but the
[49:45] that's not the type that we're looking
[49:47] at the type we're looking at is god
[49:49] destroying the earth
[49:50] god destroyed the earth then god's going
[49:53] to destroy the earth again what did he
[49:55] do here he found a people that he was
[49:58] pleased with he found a people that was
[50:01] perfect and upright he found a people
[50:04] that that despite all that was going on
[50:07] in the wickedness
[50:12] of the world that they found favor with
[50:15] god
[50:16] and that was noah
[50:17] and and god
[50:19] found the same thing today
[50:21] god has found a people that he has found
[50:24] favor with god has found a people that
[50:28] that put him first
[50:30] god has found a people that desire to be
[50:33] godly holy people even in all the
[50:37] the corruption and wickedness is going
[50:39] on in the world today he's found a
[50:41] people
[50:42] i believe i'm a part of that people
[50:44] i believe you're a part of that people
[50:46] he's found that people he's given that
[50:48] people an instruction book to follow to
[50:52] be able to understand
[50:54] how to prepare yourselves to get to the
[50:57] place where he's wanting to take us to
[51:00] faith in a body change for a rapture
[51:03] god's given us the instructions god's
[51:05] done everything he could possibly do to
[51:08] make sure that we are in that place now
[51:10] all the preparation that noah went
[51:12] through all the 120 years that noah
[51:15] built on that ark he did everything the
[51:17] way god told him to do it built it
[51:19] exactly the way god told him to build it
[51:21] and it took him all this time to do it
[51:23] see that was the preparation
[51:26] life was going on as normal
[51:28] people were living their lives just like
[51:30] normal the the the people were sinning
[51:33] and becoming more and more corrupt look
[51:36] they the people didn't start getting
[51:37] better as the ark was being built the
[51:40] people got worse as the ark was being
[51:43] built
[51:44] you think about brother branham's
[51:45] testimony
[51:47] i mean
[51:48] brother random was he was ready to quit
[51:52] he did quit at one point
[51:54] for a very short period of time
[51:56] but he was ready to quit brother brahms
[51:59] he says
[52:00] i i preach it and i preach it and i come
[52:03] back and i find it's worse now than it
[52:05] was the last time i preached it right he
[52:08] said i come back to that place and i
[52:09] preach the gospel and i preach the
[52:11] gospel i preach the gospel and i come
[52:13] back the next year the next time and sin
[52:16] is worse then and the people are worse
[52:18] then than they were when i was here last
[52:20] time
[52:21] because they don't get better during
[52:23] that period now now god is calling out
[52:25] one or two here there god's calling out
[52:28] his people here and here but the whole
[52:30] cell
[52:31] a spirit of the world the whole cell
[52:34] spirit of the people is getting worse
[52:38] now god's calling his out here
[52:40] god's calling one or two out here you
[52:42] send brother branham or a minister or uh
[52:45] uh you
[52:47] amen he can send you
[52:49] to go get this one person out
[52:52] and through your testimony through your
[52:55] help through god using you can bring
[52:57] that person to him
[52:59] so god does that piece at a time maybe
[53:01] one here one there a couple here maybe
[53:03] this service or something but the whole
[53:05] cell atmosphere the whole cell spirit of
[53:08] it got worse and worse and worse
[53:11] amen it's got worse since brother
[53:13] branham left
[53:16] it's worse today than it was yesterday
[53:18] it'll be worse tomorrow than it is today
[53:21] thank god i know a god who holds
[53:23] tomorrow
[53:24] amen so it didn't get better as noah
[53:27] built on the ark it just got worse and
[53:29] worse but he kept building he kept doing
[53:31] what god told him to do all those
[53:34] preparations everything went on like
[53:36] normal
[53:36] everything was exactly the way it's and
[53:38] they got worse but it was just normal as
[53:41] he built on the ark that was all the
[53:43] preparations that was made to bring it
[53:45] to this certain point because god was
[53:47] not going to let his son die with the
[53:51] wicked
[53:52] so he made him a way of escape him and
[53:55] his family
[53:57] praise the lord god made a web escape
[53:59] for him and his family
[54:02] remember that hold that to your heart
[54:04] now god made that way not just for noah
[54:07] but for his family praise the lord but
[54:10] the bible does not say that god found
[54:11] favor with his sons
[54:13] the bible does not say god found favor
[54:15] with his wife or with his with his
[54:17] daughter-in-laws
[54:18] he found favor with noah
[54:21] but because it was noah and they were a
[54:23] part of him
[54:24] they were saved as well
[54:26] they were they were allowed to go on the
[54:28] ark as well
[54:29] god wanted to preserve the animal life
[54:31] all those were the preparations that was
[54:34] made but when it come to the end of this
[54:37] when the ark was made
[54:39] when the when
[54:40] let's just say for
[54:42] a
[54:43] lack of better phrase the cup of
[54:44] iniquity was full
[54:47] the ark was built
[54:49] all the preparations had been made
[54:51] everything that god had told noah had
[54:53] been done
[54:55] now what happens
[54:56] they're still there
[54:58] so there has to be what i'm phrasing
[55:01] here
[55:02] that final preparation
[55:04] before destruction hit
[55:06] that final preparation we just read
[55:09] that final preparation
[55:12] that self-same day entered noah shem ham
[55:16] japheth noah's wife and his son's wives
[55:19] on the ark
[55:21] all the animals came in everything that
[55:23] god had said now god brought those
[55:24] animals in
[55:26] amen
[55:27] right noah did not go out hunting all of
[55:30] these animals and find a male giraffe
[55:33] over here and a female giraffe over here
[55:36] and say hey guys come with me
[55:38] god brought those animals in
[55:41] you you actually believe that noah went
[55:43] and and got two of the different variety
[55:46] of birds male and female
[55:49] i mean
[55:50] maybe he stood there as they came and
[55:52] landed on his finger or his shoulder or
[55:54] something but god brought them in
[55:57] all the creeping things of the earth
[55:59] no it didn't go digging
[56:02] god brought them
[56:04] that was god's that was god's final
[56:06] preparation which brings me to this
[56:10] understanding now that these final
[56:12] preparations once god has done
[56:15] what he's done his people
[56:17] the preparations have been made the ark
[56:20] was built everything was set and ready
[56:22] to go
[56:23] it come a time where they had to get on
[56:25] the ark
[56:27] and the rest was up to god
[56:30] the rest god did
[56:33] now
[56:34] when
[56:35] when all these saints are going home
[56:38] that's not our doing
[56:40] that's god doing it
[56:42] that's him making those final
[56:44] preparations for what reason i don't
[56:46] know i don't know why that's part of the
[56:48] final preparations but in my opinion i
[56:51] believe
[56:53] based on my my talking to him the other
[56:56] day about it and him giving me this
[56:58] that could very well be the point
[57:01] and if it is that's god doing that's not
[57:03] us doing it
[57:05] when though when they went on the ark
[57:08] the rest was up to god god shall see
[57:11] at the end of this
[57:12] god shut him in
[57:16] the lord shut noah in noah didn't even
[57:19] shut the door
[57:20] once they got in the ark of safety god
[57:23] did the rest all the animals god brought
[57:25] all the animals in
[57:27] they had to go but all the preparations
[57:29] were made
[57:30] but god took care of the final
[57:31] preparations
[57:33] the final preparations were held by him
[57:36] all the animals came in and god shut the
[57:38] door
[57:39] god shut the door they come knocking
[57:41] noah let us in no can't let you in god
[57:43] shut the door can't open no latch no
[57:45] string there's no rope no way to open
[57:48] the door
[57:48] i can't open it god shut it he's the
[57:51] only one that can open it while the door
[57:52] is shut when god shuts the door free and
[57:54] it's shut
[57:55] there is no opening
[57:57] amen when when grace is spurned for the
[58:01] last time there's nothing left but
[58:03] judgment when that door shut it shut
[58:06] there's no opening there was no opening
[58:08] on the ark and god shut them in that was
[58:11] it
[58:12] god took care of the rest of it
[58:14] noah's not the one that caused it to
[58:15] rain
[58:16] no it's not the one that brought the
[58:18] judgment noah's not the one that brought
[58:19] the the rain upon the earth god did that
[58:22] god shut the door god brought the
[58:24] animals god's the one that finished the
[58:26] final preparations now between the time
[58:30] that noah went on the ark and god shut
[58:32] the door we know it was seven days amen
[58:35] before it actually started raining
[58:38] a seven day period of time where they
[58:40] were sitting there on the ark
[58:42] maybe
[58:43] possibly his sons his daughter-in-law is
[58:46] wondering
[58:47] dad
[58:48] when is when is this judgment you're
[58:50] talking when is this going to happen
[58:52] day three now
[58:54] it's been three days dad are you sure
[58:57] well god shut the door what do you think
[59:00] him
[59:02] fourth day fifth day dad i i know god
[59:05] shut the door but
[59:07] there's been five days how much longer
[59:09] we're gonna have to wait for this
[59:11] sure they're human friends they were
[59:14] humans
[59:15] just like we get sometimes
[59:17] we get that way
[59:19] sometimes in our lives we question god
[59:22] and we wonder or we think why or when is
[59:24] this and
[59:25] those things happen to to us as humans
[59:28] it happened to them as humans
[59:30] i'm sure it did that and i'm
[59:32] paraphrasing that's obviously not in the
[59:33] scripture we know but
[59:35] you can just imagine after the sixth day
[59:37] no rain
[59:39] but god's the one that brought the final
[59:41] preparation to bring them to that point
[59:43] and then when judgment struck that was
[59:45] the end of it
[59:46] that was that that destroyed that
[59:49] destroyed everything now all that noah
[59:51] did
[59:52] through through bringing those
[59:53] instructions to the ark was done noah
[59:56] did exactly what god said do
[59:59] you know
[1:00:00] we believe that when the bride is ready
[1:00:03] god will take her home
[1:00:06] but do you realize that
[1:00:09] in our eyes
[1:00:11] we will never be ready
[1:00:15] i'll i will never i can't believe that i
[1:00:18] will let's just say i mean we don't know
[1:00:21] what might happen after the dead start
[1:00:22] to appear before us right but in my in
[1:00:26] my flesh looking at myself looking at
[1:00:28] you
[1:00:30] we'll never be ready
[1:00:32] not in my eyes but it's not my eyes i'm
[1:00:34] concerned about because i don't do the
[1:00:36] final preparations that's god's doing
[1:00:39] yeah
[1:00:40] and i believe god's doing it right now
[1:00:42] through his spirit moving upon his
[1:00:44] people we've done what he told us to do
[1:00:47] we've been born again filled with his
[1:00:50] spirit had the holy ghost we followed
[1:00:52] his word we live in our lives based on
[1:00:55] the word that he's given us we've done
[1:00:57] and followed the instructions the way
[1:00:59] god has shown us to follow them the best
[1:01:01] that we know how now when god looks at
[1:01:03] it what is he looking at
[1:01:07] he's looking at a perfect bride
[1:01:10] amen a perfect bride it's just like the
[1:01:12] manifest the manifested sons of god i
[1:01:15] have so many people look and say well
[1:01:18] i don't believe that's taken place yet
[1:01:19] within i tell them but did you know how
[1:01:21] far along we've gotten
[1:01:23] to go before rapture if the sons of god
[1:01:26] are not manifesting themselves if they
[1:01:28] have not been manifested at this point
[1:01:30] then where are we
[1:01:32] we're not in a rapture
[1:01:34] because that's got to happen before the
[1:01:35] rapture takes place
[1:01:37] there's got to be a manifestation of the
[1:01:39] sons of god oh friend
[1:01:43] i i i believe there's going to be a
[1:01:45] there's going to be a finalization to
[1:01:47] that but i believe the sons of god are
[1:01:48] being manifested right now
[1:01:51] now they're always here
[1:01:54] we talk about
[1:01:56] uh
[1:01:57] him the lord coming in power and
[1:02:00] manifestation
[1:02:01] you know what that means
[1:02:03] that means that god is here he's just
[1:02:05] having to show himself
[1:02:08] reveal himself or manifest himself to
[1:02:12] show who he really is
[1:02:14] well god does that to us every day
[1:02:17] every day of our lives god does that
[1:02:18] very thing when you shun the world and
[1:02:21] you shun sin and you turn your back on
[1:02:24] the things of the world to follow god in
[1:02:26] his word that is exactly what you're
[1:02:28] doing
[1:02:30] that preparation in your life is is
[1:02:33] continually made to do what god's word
[1:02:36] and when we slip make a mistake do
[1:02:38] something we shouldn't say something or
[1:02:40] a little anger spirit or something god
[1:02:42] forgive me
[1:02:43] i'm sorry lord i didn't mean to be like
[1:02:45] that
[1:02:46] but but see the life that was in the
[1:02:49] blood we always talk about the blood and
[1:02:52] not that is true
[1:02:53] the blood is the annihilates every sin
[1:02:56] but the chemistry of the blood went on
[1:02:58] the earth it's the life that was in that
[1:03:00] blood what was the life in the blood it
[1:03:02] was him
[1:03:03] it was christ it was the holy ghost it
[1:03:06] was his life coming on us well friend if
[1:03:09] his life has come on us then we are
[1:03:12] guiltless
[1:03:15] we are sinless
[1:03:17] no matter how many times
[1:03:19] now we don't do it purposely see then
[1:03:21] that's where it gets it
[1:03:22] you know brother said the catholic
[1:03:24] church has a lot of truth in it you know
[1:03:26] he said that right amen they have a lot
[1:03:28] of truth but they go to seed on so many
[1:03:30] things
[1:03:31] and and
[1:03:33] even like the absolute absolution of sin
[1:03:36] but they go to seed on it but see
[1:03:38] that's the difference
[1:03:40] between a child of god and someone who
[1:03:43] practices it as a religion
[1:03:46] a child of god just lives that word
[1:03:49] because it's who they are
[1:03:51] someone who practices it as a religion
[1:03:54] sees it as a right
[1:03:56] some kind of a religious right that they
[1:03:59] do
[1:04:00] it's not a religious right for us it is
[1:04:03] a it is life
[1:04:05] when the life come into that in in to
[1:04:08] each one of us
[1:04:10] the the light that was in the blood it
[1:04:12] annihilated every sin
[1:04:14] past present future
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:18] as if though you never sinned to begin
[1:04:20] with
[1:04:22] praise the lord now again unlike the
[1:04:24] catholic church or other churches my
[1:04:27] there's probably even people i know
[1:04:31] i try to watch myself sometimes but in
[1:04:33] this message they think they can do
[1:04:35] whatever they want and it's okay
[1:04:36] well god forgives me
[1:04:38] no
[1:04:39] if you're just living your life however
[1:04:41] you want to it proves there's not a life
[1:04:44] of god in you
[1:04:47] that's the best way i can explain it
[1:04:49] it may sound harsh but that's just the
[1:04:52] truth
[1:04:53] if you're living your life and you say
[1:04:54] oh well god will forgive me i'll just
[1:04:57] live however i want and god will forgive
[1:04:59] me then your life is not lived according
[1:05:01] to the life that he has put in you your
[1:05:04] testimonies your life is not matching
[1:05:07] your testimony
[1:05:09] your life must match your testimony
[1:05:12] that way it's not a matter of saying oh
[1:05:14] i know god will forgive me
[1:05:16] no i don't ever want to do it in the
[1:05:18] first place
[1:05:20] but we are still human we do make
[1:05:22] mistakes we still do things that we
[1:05:24] shouldn't do but the final preparation
[1:05:26] friend that's god's to do
[1:05:29] that's god's we've done what god has
[1:05:31] told us to do now we're in the position
[1:05:35] now we know that we we grow in grace
[1:05:38] uh we know we lay in the presence of the
[1:05:40] sun to ripen
[1:05:42] but who ripens us
[1:05:43] as we do what god told us to do and we
[1:05:46] read our bibles we pray we
[1:05:49] live for god we live our lives for god
[1:05:50] we
[1:05:51] we shun evil
[1:05:54] we do what god's life what god's word
[1:05:56] commands us to do
[1:05:59] that's a that's a bride that's ready to
[1:06:01] go home
[1:06:02] but it's god's time whatever god sees
[1:06:05] and
[1:06:07] you know there was this period of time
[1:06:09] where we kind of went through this in
[1:06:10] the message where we're waiting on that
[1:06:12] last seat
[1:06:13] you know some preacher somewhere found a
[1:06:15] quote where brother adam mentioned about
[1:06:17] a last seed and i don't disagree with
[1:06:19] that now don't get me wrong i'm not just
[1:06:22] agree with that but we can't base
[1:06:24] everything that we are and what we do
[1:06:26] and how we live just on worrying about
[1:06:28] one last scene
[1:06:31] it makes us apathetic is what it does
[1:06:34] and we can't ever get to the place that
[1:06:36] we're where we're apathetic friend we
[1:06:38] should always be striving and pushing
[1:06:40] and and
[1:06:42] living for god and obeying his word and
[1:06:44] doing what god commands us to do
[1:06:47] it's a bride that's ready see and when
[1:06:49] the bride is done what god said the rest
[1:06:52] is up to him then what else can we do
[1:06:56] can you give yourself a body change
[1:06:59] can you cause the dead in christ to rise
[1:07:02] can you cause a rapture to take place
[1:07:04] can you make a rapture happen that god
[1:07:06] does all that right
[1:07:09] god's the one that raises the dead god's
[1:07:11] the one that uh
[1:07:13] brings a body change god's the ones now
[1:07:15] it's a reflection
[1:07:17] of what we've what we have done by
[1:07:19] following the instruction
[1:07:22] just like being in the ark and going
[1:07:23] over the flood was a reflection of the
[1:07:26] preparations that was made
[1:07:29] it was it only it only reflected what
[1:07:32] had already been done
[1:07:34] because he was there
[1:07:36] us a body change taking place in us is
[1:07:39] simply a reflection of what we're doing
[1:07:42] by living holy godly christian lives
[1:07:45] it's the result is just a reflection of
[1:07:48] that
[1:07:49] see
[1:07:50] you can make biscuits all day
[1:07:52] and and you know how to make biscuits
[1:07:54] and and the flour and the dough and and
[1:07:57] and do everything and how to cook them
[1:07:59] put them in the oven and
[1:08:00] but but once all the ingredients go in
[1:08:03] and make this nice beautiful biscuit
[1:08:04] that you come out and stick a nice piece
[1:08:06] of country ham in the middle of an eat
[1:08:08] that's just a result of what you did
[1:08:10] over here
[1:08:12] right it's just a result
[1:08:15] you went and did all the preparation but
[1:08:18] then you put in the oven the oven baked
[1:08:20] it and made it
[1:08:21] do what it was supposed to bring it to
[1:08:23] the point where you could eat it
[1:08:26] but you look at the this final biscuit
[1:08:28] that you eat
[1:08:29] and that's and it's it's a good one it's
[1:08:32] really good but
[1:08:34] it's just a result of what happened over
[1:08:37] here
[1:08:38] with your apron all flowered in hands i
[1:08:40] saw my mom make
[1:08:42] thousands of biscuits in my life
[1:08:45] eight probably thousands of them myself
[1:08:46] too but i saw
[1:08:49] the result that happened
[1:08:51] when she go stick that thing in the oven
[1:08:52] she's just covered she's got dough on
[1:08:54] her fingers she's got flour aprons she's
[1:08:56] you know probably even in her hair
[1:08:58] going everywhere it's just a result of
[1:09:01] and so the biscuit that we come out that
[1:09:03] the kids eat and enjoy it's just a
[1:09:05] result of what mom did to prepare it
[1:09:08] to bring it to that point
[1:09:10] now see so we don't negate the
[1:09:12] preparations that
[1:09:14] that god has commanded and called and
[1:09:16] put in our possession to do
[1:09:18] but we know that the the rest of this
[1:09:21] that god is doing now i believe that god
[1:09:23] is doing now
[1:09:25] is the final preparation to bring it to
[1:09:28] that place
[1:09:30] amen god didn't tell us
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:33] to
[1:09:34] for so and so
[1:09:36] to go to their reward now that god knows
[1:09:39] that so god does that
[1:09:41] that's not in our charge
[1:09:43] it's not in our control
[1:09:45] nor is it in our charge of control for
[1:09:47] them to resurrect from the dead
[1:09:51] that's god to do
[1:09:53] nor is it for us to go in a rapture
[1:09:57] body change that's for god to do
[1:10:00] but it's a result of what god has
[1:10:02] already done for us and through us
[1:10:05] and the effort that we put into it
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:09] that is just it's just the resulting
[1:10:12] example
[1:10:13] now the interesting thing
[1:10:17] that came to me this morning
[1:10:20] was
[1:10:22] when god destroyed the earth in the
[1:10:25] flood
[1:10:28] there was one person
[1:10:30] there was one man
[1:10:32] that we notably at least
[1:10:34] notably died at the time of the flood
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] that was methuselah yes methuselah was
[1:10:42] the man that not only lived the longest
[1:10:43] on the earth 969 years he was not on the
[1:10:46] oldest man ever to live but he was uh he
[1:10:49] was a a signal
[1:10:51] yeah uh to noah even brother adam talked
[1:10:54] about enoch and enoch going up well
[1:10:56] enoch methuselah was enoch's son
[1:11:00] and methuselah's name in in the greek
[1:11:04] methuselah as you see it in i believe
[1:11:06] it's matthew
[1:11:09] means when he dies there shall be an
[1:11:11] emission or a sending forth of waters
[1:11:14] upon the earth
[1:11:17] that that is built into methuselah's
[1:11:20] name that's what his name means
[1:11:23] when i die when methuselah dies there
[1:11:27] will be an initiation on a mission of
[1:11:30] coming forth of water upon the earth
[1:11:33] methuselah
[1:11:35] and when did methuselah die methuselah
[1:11:37] you can go get one of brother past
[1:11:38] charts if you haven't you can see but
[1:11:40] through this little scripture you go
[1:11:41] read the scripture you can see he just
[1:11:43] did the work
[1:11:44] you go see methuselah died the same year
[1:11:48] according to scripture yes that the
[1:11:50] flood took place yes
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:54] so if methuselah died
[1:11:57] and methuselah passing on
[1:12:00] propagated the final preparation would
[1:12:03] that have been a part of that final
[1:12:05] preparation
[1:12:07] there's a little passing
[1:12:09] to me
[1:12:10] methuselah passing away was a part of
[1:12:13] the final preparations noah didn't do
[1:12:15] that
[1:12:17] no no his family they didn't go kill
[1:12:18] methuselah god did that right the final
[1:12:22] preparation that god had in the angel of
[1:12:25] the world and the destruction of the
[1:12:27] flood was to take a man from the earth
[1:12:31] for him to die
[1:12:33] for him to pass away
[1:12:35] so we can't say well
[1:12:37] you know the the final preparations
[1:12:39] that's taking place today all these
[1:12:41] people going beyond the curtain of time
[1:12:43] or god taking them or going to their
[1:12:45] resting place or final reward god taking
[1:12:47] these people is that a part of these
[1:12:49] final preparations
[1:12:52] these final preparations i would say
[1:12:55] methuselah had to die
[1:12:57] at that time
[1:12:59] for god's word to be fulfilled
[1:13:03] it was in his name
[1:13:05] so when methuselah died
[1:13:08] god taking methuselah was a part of the
[1:13:10] final preparations god was making
[1:13:13] then god told noah y'all get on the ark
[1:13:16] all the animals came the creeping things
[1:13:18] the birds and all came on the ark and
[1:13:20] then god shut the door and god made it
[1:13:22] rain and god brought the floods and god
[1:13:25] did all the final preparation
[1:13:28] everything about it was god
[1:13:30] but it probably it was propagated by him
[1:13:33] taking a man from the earth
[1:13:36] it began
[1:13:37] with methuselah
[1:13:39] dying
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:42] if god's done it once
[1:13:45] we look at types and shadows to see if
[1:13:47] god does it once would he do it again
[1:13:49] right
[1:13:50] he's the same god yes amen
[1:13:53] let's go to acts chapter 2.
[1:14:00] another major scriptural event
[1:14:03] one very pertinent to
[1:14:05] today
[1:14:09] acts chapter 2 verse 1. we know it we
[1:14:12] probably could quote it
[1:14:16] acts 2 1 and when the day of pentecost
[1:14:18] was fully come
[1:14:19] fully come they were all with one accord
[1:14:22] in one place
[1:14:24] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:14:26] heaven as a rushing mighty wind and
[1:14:28] filled all the house where they were
[1:14:30] sitting there appeared unto them cloven
[1:14:32] tongues like as a fire and sat upon each
[1:14:34] of them and they were all filled with
[1:14:36] the holy ghost who began to speak with
[1:14:39] other tongues as the spirits gave them
[1:14:41] utterance now jesus had already told
[1:14:43] them
[1:14:44] jesus told him to go to jerusalem and
[1:14:47] carry there until
[1:14:50] you'd be
[1:14:51] endued with power from omaha right that
[1:14:54] was god's instructions
[1:14:56] the preparations were made
[1:14:59] it cost a man his life
[1:15:02] whose life did it cost
[1:15:04] jesus
[1:15:05] it cost jesus life
[1:15:08] because it wasn't the same day but
[1:15:11] within a few weeks of jesus passing
[1:15:14] dying is when he came into the upper
[1:15:17] room and fulfilled this scripture
[1:15:22] man died jesus
[1:15:24] all the preparations were already made
[1:15:26] jesus was here he walked with him he
[1:15:28] talked with them they saw him all the
[1:15:30] things that took place while jesus was
[1:15:32] here and all the things he told him to
[1:15:34] do was exactly what god had told him
[1:15:37] amen and when they got to that place and
[1:15:39] jesus then told him he said now i'd
[1:15:41] carry in jerusalem until you were endued
[1:15:44] with power from on high so what did they
[1:15:46] do
[1:15:47] they finalized that preparation god gave
[1:15:50] them and they went in jerusalem in the
[1:15:51] upper room and they carried there
[1:15:54] and i don't know that we know how long
[1:15:56] the scripture doesn't say they were
[1:15:58] there a while
[1:15:59] tearing in the upper room
[1:16:01] waited
[1:16:02] in the upper room
[1:16:04] now they had done all of their part
[1:16:06] right they had done everything god told
[1:16:08] them to do now the final preparation was
[1:16:11] up to god
[1:16:13] the rest of it was god to do
[1:16:15] because the bible says
[1:16:19] they were fully come when the day of
[1:16:21] pentecost was fully come
[1:16:23] now that would be a finalization of that
[1:16:26] preparation fully would be a a
[1:16:29] finalization of something is fulfilling
[1:16:31] of something
[1:16:33] correct
[1:16:34] unless i'm wrong
[1:16:36] the finalization of something is a
[1:16:37] fulfilling of something it it is
[1:16:39] fulfilled when it fully when the day of
[1:16:42] pentecost fully came
[1:16:43] see they were all with one accord in one
[1:16:46] place now they've done what they were
[1:16:48] supposed to do
[1:16:49] that was their part
[1:16:51] after they had done their part
[1:16:54] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:16:57] as a rushing mighty wind and filled all
[1:16:59] the house where they were sick now who
[1:17:01] did that
[1:17:03] that was god
[1:17:05] god came down and filled all the house
[1:17:09] just like i come i pray in this place
[1:17:10] god fill all this house where we'll be
[1:17:12] sitting right see fill this whole house
[1:17:15] where we'll be sitting do it again today
[1:17:17] lord yes
[1:17:18] he's done so many times yes
[1:17:21] but i can't do that
[1:17:23] i can pray that we can make the
[1:17:24] preparations we can be here but it takes
[1:17:27] god to do it
[1:17:29] it takes god to come and fill this place
[1:17:32] to fill all this house it takes god to
[1:17:35] appear uh uh with cloven tongues like a
[1:17:38] fire and set upon each one and fill each
[1:17:41] one with the holy ghost it takes god to
[1:17:43] do that
[1:17:45] that's not mine that's god's doing now
[1:17:48] once the final preparations were made
[1:17:50] what is the result
[1:17:52] the result is a christian
[1:17:54] what we just simply call a christian
[1:17:56] today
[1:17:57] i don't think a person should be allowed
[1:17:59] to be called a christian unless they're
[1:18:00] born again and filled with the holy
[1:18:01] ghost
[1:18:02] that's my opinion because the word
[1:18:04] christian means to be christ-like and
[1:18:06] there's no way you can even come close
[1:18:07] to being christ-like unless you've been
[1:18:09] born again and filled with the holy
[1:18:11] spirit amen amen
[1:18:14] so that made christians
[1:18:16] that made godly men and women
[1:18:19] that made people fulfilling the
[1:18:21] scripture joel 2 28 that he poured out
[1:18:24] his spirit upon all flesh who god did
[1:18:28] they made the preparations
[1:18:31] but it took god to bring in the final
[1:18:32] preparations for them to become
[1:18:34] christians
[1:18:36] it took god to do the final preparations
[1:18:39] to destroy and wipe out all life upon
[1:18:41] this earth to bring about a new world
[1:18:45] in the andalusian flood it's got to do
[1:18:47] the same thing as we recognize what's
[1:18:49] going on today
[1:18:51] this final preparation is glad to make
[1:18:53] it now in the flood a man died
[1:18:56] methuselah it's a signal noah get on the
[1:18:58] ark flood's coming
[1:19:01] when jesus died it was a signal go terry
[1:19:04] in jerusalem until you are due with
[1:19:06] power
[1:19:07] when they did then jesus died his spirit
[1:19:10] came
[1:19:11] you understand this major event these
[1:19:14] major events god's taking care of that
[1:19:17] the final preparations i hope i make
[1:19:19] this clear god's the ones that does that
[1:19:23] we have to fulfill and complete the
[1:19:25] parts that god give us to do
[1:19:27] now the rest of it's up to him and i
[1:19:29] believe he's doing it
[1:19:30] i do
[1:19:32] i'll just be honest i know i've been a
[1:19:34] little vague about it but i honestly do
[1:19:36] believe
[1:19:37] that a lot of this is going on now and
[1:19:39] so many of these saints of god passing
[1:19:41] on is is god's final preparation
[1:19:45] now why it's that way i don't know i
[1:19:47] know why it was with methuselah i know
[1:19:50] why it was with jesus but i don't know
[1:19:52] why it is today i don't
[1:19:55] but i do know that i believe that god's
[1:19:57] given me
[1:19:58] specific instruction to let you know
[1:20:01] saints yes covet is going to be like a
[1:20:04] cold compared to what's about him
[1:20:08] we haven't seen anything amen
[1:20:12] but about what
[1:20:14] then what's about to hit this earth amen
[1:20:16] and these are just the preparations that
[1:20:18] god is making friend
[1:20:20] because brother adam said there will be
[1:20:22] a time the only immunity we'll have is
[1:20:24] the holy spirit yes amen the only
[1:20:27] immunity we'll have will be the holy
[1:20:29] spirit saints and
[1:20:31] and i believe we're at that time
[1:20:34] not necessarily with covet but what is
[1:20:36] going to happen after this right you
[1:20:39] think these people in power these people
[1:20:42] that have all kinds of money and can do
[1:20:44] pretty much whatever they want because
[1:20:45] it's all hidden darkness you think they
[1:20:48] can do whatever they want they you think
[1:20:50] now that they figured out a way that
[1:20:51] they can garner control of the world's
[1:20:53] population they're going to let that go
[1:20:55] right
[1:20:57] oh goodness no you just see a small sm a
[1:21:00] spackling of it just in this country
[1:21:02] i mean even studies have come out lately
[1:21:04] and said that all these shutdowns and
[1:21:06] nests and all this stuff has done little
[1:21:08] to nothing to assuage the depth of our
[1:21:11] population
[1:21:12] little to nothing
[1:21:15] so
[1:21:15] and not the shots i'm not saying that
[1:21:17] but the the the shutting down the
[1:21:20] country and the quarantining and the
[1:21:22] masking and all that they've come out
[1:21:24] with studies now that have proved that
[1:21:25] that
[1:21:28] point two percent of people it probably
[1:21:31] helped now
[1:21:32] thank god that's good for those point
[1:21:34] two of people but that's a small amount
[1:21:37] of people compared to the people that
[1:21:38] were affected adversely by the shutdown
[1:21:42] by losing their livelihoods by losing
[1:21:44] their money but but suicides and people
[1:21:47] killing themselves and drug addiction
[1:21:49] and
[1:21:50] and and the suicides the the mental
[1:21:52] disparity how many how many people have
[1:21:56] fallen prey to that
[1:21:58] versus
[1:21:59] what coven would have done
[1:22:01] left undone
[1:22:04] but even with the studies that have come
[1:22:06] out and said now and said how little
[1:22:08] effect it has had they still keep things
[1:22:10] clamped down
[1:22:12] they still keep the people under their
[1:22:14] thumbs
[1:22:15] why
[1:22:16] because they found out a way that they
[1:22:18] can keep get control over the world's
[1:22:21] population
[1:22:23] this is an international bride and it's
[1:22:25] going to be an international rapture but
[1:22:28] that being said it's also going to be an
[1:22:31] international
[1:22:33] satan's eden
[1:22:34] that's going to be controlled by the
[1:22:36] beast it's not just going to be the
[1:22:39] united states that's going to be
[1:22:40] controlled by the beast the entire world
[1:22:43] is going to be controlled by the beast
[1:22:45] so you think for one moment that they
[1:22:47] found out exactly how they can gain
[1:22:49] control even over the freedom-loving
[1:22:52] citizens of this country that they're
[1:22:54] going to let it go
[1:22:56] this is just the beginning friends
[1:22:59] what's going to come on this earth is
[1:23:02] brother adam talked about making cancer
[1:23:05] look like a toothache
[1:23:08] well koga's been pretty bad
[1:23:11] but it's not going to be anything
[1:23:13] compared to what's coming yeah
[1:23:16] but who god is in control of his own
[1:23:19] god takes care of his children yes god's
[1:23:22] going to take care of us friend
[1:23:24] regardless amen god's going to take care
[1:23:27] of his children because he always takes
[1:23:29] care of them
[1:23:30] god finalized this day in the upper room
[1:23:34] god finalized it
[1:23:35] amen elohim before god destroyed sodom
[1:23:39] and gomorrah
[1:23:41] god came to abraham
[1:23:44] because he said shall i let abraham
[1:23:46] shall i do this great thing without
[1:23:48] letting abraham know
[1:23:50] no got to go tell abraham abraham was
[1:23:52] his man
[1:23:53] just like he told noah just like he told
[1:23:56] jesus and told the disciples just like
[1:23:59] god sent a prophet to this last day to
[1:24:01] tell a bride at this last day
[1:24:04] surely the lord god would do nothing
[1:24:06] except he reveal his secrets to his
[1:24:07] servants the prophets now i'm not
[1:24:10] talking about an agabus prophet i'm
[1:24:12] talking about a word prophet
[1:24:15] like william branham
[1:24:17] not somebody that just has a simple
[1:24:18] prophetic gift that might hit a little
[1:24:20] here a little bit there i'm talking
[1:24:22] about somebody who had thus saith the
[1:24:25] lord
[1:24:26] that never failed
[1:24:28] they had a word to bring a bride to a
[1:24:30] place to where it brought rapturing
[1:24:32] faith
[1:24:33] through the word a transformation
[1:24:36] through the word
[1:24:38] it had to be for this last day god did
[1:24:39] it here he did it with abraham when god
[1:24:42] went to abraham god told abraham and
[1:24:44] abraham said i gotta go now god said i
[1:24:46] gotta go now and see whether it's all as
[1:24:48] bad as they say it is and he sent the
[1:24:50] other two angels to go check
[1:24:52] they went down there they pulled out lot
[1:24:54] his family and and then what happened
[1:24:56] the final preparations was made
[1:24:59] or the the preparations was made who did
[1:25:01] the final preparation god did yes
[1:25:05] god said i
[1:25:07] have to go down there now and see
[1:25:10] now he sent us two angels but it was the
[1:25:12] same thing
[1:25:13] they were his representatives
[1:25:16] they had his
[1:25:17] spirit if you will
[1:25:20] saying that more in reference to us
[1:25:21] today
[1:25:22] we have his spirit
[1:25:24] we are his representatives
[1:25:26] we acknowledge and recognize what's
[1:25:28] going on in the spirit of the world
[1:25:30] today
[1:25:31] we acknowledge that this bride worldwide
[1:25:33] we acknowledge it we see it as it is
[1:25:36] we know it's as bad as it is friend how
[1:25:39] much longer till the cup of iniquity is
[1:25:41] full today
[1:25:44] i dares i say not much
[1:25:47] not much
[1:25:48] if any
[1:25:49] but if final preparations are being made
[1:25:51] now
[1:25:54] seven days on the ark after the final
[1:25:56] after the preparations were made seven
[1:25:59] days
[1:26:00] were the were the fulfillment of the
[1:26:02] final preparations
[1:26:03] the day of pentecost 50 days
[1:26:06] amen 50 days that's all that there was
[1:26:09] that was
[1:26:10] years preparing up to that point
[1:26:13] for 50 days
[1:26:14] look at well we don't know about when
[1:26:17] elohim went to abraham
[1:26:20] but when the destruction came
[1:26:22] it was there
[1:26:24] the angels came that day the next day
[1:26:26] they spent the night there the next day
[1:26:28] they said get out
[1:26:30] get out of the city and don't look back
[1:26:33] and as soon as the heels hit the edge of
[1:26:36] that city fire and brimstone rained upon
[1:26:39] that city
[1:26:40] there was no more mercy
[1:26:42] there was no more grace
[1:26:44] there's nothing but judgment
[1:26:46] friend i know when i talk about the
[1:26:48] blood on the mercy seat when that blood
[1:26:50] comes off that mercy seat friend it
[1:26:51] becomes a judgment seat
[1:26:53] after that after that happens there's
[1:26:56] nothing left but judgment
[1:26:58] amen is it there i don't think so
[1:27:02] is it going to get there absolutely yes
[1:27:04] i have my idea of when it will
[1:27:06] i believe it'll be when the dead and
[1:27:08] christ rise
[1:27:09] that's my opinion yes well the band
[1:27:11] doesn't say but that's my opinion i
[1:27:12] think it'll be at that time i think at
[1:27:14] that point that that is the equivalent
[1:27:17] in my opinion of god shutting the door
[1:27:19] yes right
[1:27:20] no more come in no more get out brother
[1:27:23] man and preach souls that are in prison
[1:27:26] amen souls are in prison yeah they were
[1:27:28] prince too but they had no way out they
[1:27:31] had no escape they had no way to get out
[1:27:34] noah preached to those that were banging
[1:27:36] on the door noah let us in i can't let
[1:27:38] you in
[1:27:39] god shut the door noah's preaching to
[1:27:42] him god shut the door i can't open him
[1:27:45] amen what could they do about it there
[1:27:47] was nothing they could do about it
[1:27:49] god had built that god had had noah in
[1:27:51] the instructions build that art to the
[1:27:53] place that is impenetrable they couldn't
[1:27:55] get in that ark if they wanted to
[1:27:57] making fun of him of course but they
[1:27:59] couldn't get in there
[1:28:01] when they come and preach the souls that
[1:28:03] are in prison that's it friend there's
[1:28:04] no more mercy
[1:28:06] god have mercy on us now because there
[1:28:09] is there will be none at that point
[1:28:10] there will be no mercy
[1:28:12] amen the bride's seal she's done
[1:28:14] finished brother brown talks about that
[1:28:15] time the blood comes off the mercy seat
[1:28:17] he's got that book and there's no more
[1:28:19] mercy
[1:28:20] there's nothing but judgment those final
[1:28:23] preparations what's god doing is that
[1:28:24] now has the last one come in we don't
[1:28:27] know
[1:28:28] we do know there's a short period of
[1:28:30] time i can't see how it could be much
[1:28:32] longer
[1:28:34] jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:28:35] sodom
[1:28:37] as it was in the days of life if you
[1:28:39] want to question anything about this the
[1:28:41] spirit the scripture references a
[1:28:44] precedent that i've tried to pull for
[1:28:46] you today you can look at jesus own
[1:28:48] words he said as it was in the days of
[1:28:50] noah so shall it be today right not his
[1:28:53] day
[1:28:54] amen today now it was there too but he's
[1:28:58] talking about us today
[1:29:00] when the
[1:29:01] prophetic son of man is being revealed
[1:29:04] again
[1:29:06] that's today
[1:29:08] brother brahm didn't do anything else he
[1:29:10] was to point us
[1:29:12] the bride of christ to christ
[1:29:15] not to himself to him christ the word
[1:29:18] that was his message that was his
[1:29:20] purpose to turn a bride's heart back to
[1:29:23] the the faith
[1:29:24] back to christ the word
[1:29:27] jesus said so shall it be as it is and
[1:29:29] it is today
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:37] he said surely i'll do nothing except i
[1:29:39] reveal it to my servants the prophets
[1:29:42] revelation 10 7 but in the days of the
[1:29:45] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:29:47] begin to sound the mystery of god should
[1:29:49] be finished as he declared to his
[1:29:51] servants the prophets finished
[1:29:53] when he finished his work god took him
[1:29:55] home
[1:29:56] yeah
[1:29:57] amen where are we now
[1:29:59] we're 56 years later and the bride's
[1:30:01] still sitting here those that of us who
[1:30:03] are left those who of us who have come
[1:30:05] along since that time right
[1:30:08] some of us sitting here that's been born
[1:30:11] since 1965. there's a few of us that was
[1:30:14] before 1965 but i think most of us
[1:30:16] sitting here after 1965
[1:30:19] including myself well 10 days
[1:30:23] so where are we at today
[1:30:25] have we reached the place of those final
[1:30:27] preparations
[1:30:29] i would say yes
[1:30:31] i would say that that's a part of what
[1:30:32] we're watching what's going on today
[1:30:35] i would say that's part of what why we
[1:30:37] see the loved ones going on
[1:30:39] and why the the the world is turning the
[1:30:41] way it's turning and the government and
[1:30:43] and and what colbot has done
[1:30:45] and and believing that covet is just the
[1:30:47] beginning
[1:30:48] it's just i say beginning but it's just
[1:30:51] a it's just a pin prick to what's going
[1:30:54] to happen
[1:30:55] what is about to strike this earth
[1:30:56] friend
[1:30:57] men's hearts are going to fail for
[1:31:00] fear just simply being afraid they're
[1:31:03] going to be so afraid their hearts are
[1:31:06] going to stop beating
[1:31:08] that's going to be a perilous time
[1:31:09] saints we're in bad times today but i
[1:31:11] haven't heard of anybody's heart just
[1:31:13] stopping because they're afraid of
[1:31:14] something
[1:31:16] now people are in engulfed with fear but
[1:31:19] not to that point
[1:31:21] so what's it going to be
[1:31:23] we're at that finalization
[1:31:25] i know
[1:31:26] when the lord had me write this book
[1:31:30] all the preparations and all the typing
[1:31:32] and all the things does god give me
[1:31:35] i started years before that a lot of
[1:31:37] people don't know it but
[1:31:40] every morning when i go into school i
[1:31:42] would i put on earphones and i'd listen
[1:31:44] to the scripture for an hour or more i
[1:31:47] can't remember how long it was now i'd
[1:31:49] go in at six o'clock
[1:31:50] and school didn't start to eight
[1:31:52] and i would i'd sit there at my desk and
[1:31:55] just listen to the bible and every time
[1:31:57] a scripture something came up
[1:31:59] i i'd write it down something the lord
[1:32:01] inspired me to that that would follow
[1:32:03] along in that same then i wrote it down
[1:32:05] all the scripture
[1:32:07] all the scripture that's in that book i
[1:32:08] don't know all that i didn't know all
[1:32:10] that scripture by my heart i'm not that
[1:32:12] smart
[1:32:13] i've read the bible through of course
[1:32:15] many times or a few times at least from
[1:32:18] beginning to end but i'm not that smart
[1:32:20] to remember all those scriptures
[1:32:22] but as the lord gave me that to do and
[1:32:24] had that period of time i wrote all
[1:32:25] those scriptures down i had pages of
[1:32:27] scriptures i had them written in
[1:32:29] different places even
[1:32:31] so when it come time and
[1:32:33] and
[1:32:34] i finally succumbed to the lord saying
[1:32:36] do this and i said okay lord
[1:32:38] i'm insufficient to this job but i'll do
[1:32:41] it
[1:32:42] but what have i told you sometimes god
[1:32:44] is just looking for somebody who's
[1:32:45] willing
[1:32:46] a less qualified person god will give a
[1:32:49] job to a less qualified person just
[1:32:51] because they're willing to do it
[1:32:53] i finally
[1:32:54] became willing to do it
[1:32:56] but all those scriptures were there all
[1:32:58] the scriptures up but all this just all
[1:33:00] preparation yeah amen then i had a final
[1:33:03] preparation i had uh brother dale knight
[1:33:06] proof read it for me i had brother mark
[1:33:08] stroke or proofread i had different ones
[1:33:10] look at it read it go over it and
[1:33:12] march and i i had four or five six five
[1:33:16] copies of it
[1:33:18] when it was done here and then this was
[1:33:19] still wrong and then to fix them for
[1:33:21] before it finally came to where it is
[1:33:23] today i had so many copies but there
[1:33:25] come a time where the final preparation
[1:33:27] was made before it went to the printer
[1:33:30] and it became what it was
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:33] thank god
[1:33:35] creation was done the same way
[1:33:38] god did creation the same way
[1:33:40] amen
[1:33:42] nobody died at that point but all of
[1:33:44] earth was created at that point for that
[1:33:47] all the pre the preparations that god
[1:33:49] had made
[1:33:51] god rested on the seventh day but that
[1:33:54] was because of everything he had already
[1:33:56] done
[1:33:57] god took
[1:33:58] and created heaven and earth
[1:34:01] and then he planted botany life in the
[1:34:03] earth then he brought forth animal life
[1:34:05] on the earth and then he finalized it by
[1:34:07] putting human man
[1:34:09] making man a spirit being just like he
[1:34:12] was
[1:34:13] and then putting him in flesh and
[1:34:14] planting him in the garden of eden just
[1:34:16] like a tree it's planted by the river of
[1:34:18] water
[1:34:19] adam was set there in the in the garden
[1:34:21] of eden planted like a tree
[1:34:24] roots going out you read that
[1:34:27] he was planted he was a man
[1:34:29] that was god's final preparation god
[1:34:31] made man last
[1:34:34] and then he rested
[1:34:36] amen i believe that's what god's doing
[1:34:38] today
[1:34:40] i believe the final preparations are
[1:34:42] happening right now
[1:34:44] it's a short period of time but we've
[1:34:46] been 7 000 years
[1:34:49] what's this short period of time going
[1:34:51] to be is it going to be days
[1:34:52] is it going to be months is it going to
[1:34:54] be a year years i don't know
[1:34:57] but it's very significant when you see
[1:34:59] things in the spiritual realm taking
[1:35:01] place the way they are
[1:35:03] that's god's doing
[1:35:05] that's not our doing that's god moving
[1:35:08] so many years it looked like we were
[1:35:09] just going along the way we were going
[1:35:12] and then all of a sudden
[1:35:14] and people want to blame it on this that
[1:35:16] or the other a lot of people want to
[1:35:17] blame it on covet i don't
[1:35:19] amen again i don't think
[1:35:21] god through code can't claim god's
[1:35:23] children
[1:35:24] but
[1:35:25] satan is excuse me can't claim god's
[1:35:28] children through copenhagen but
[1:35:30] it's just a part of this period of time
[1:35:33] amen notice when god does those things
[1:35:35] like that it's not just the one thing
[1:35:37] god brings it kind of comes all in
[1:35:39] at the same time
[1:35:41] together
[1:35:43] and and then that's what's going on i i
[1:35:45] to me
[1:35:46] that's what i see that god's doing it's
[1:35:48] happening
[1:35:50] god's making the final preparations now
[1:35:52] how much longer is it before we go home
[1:35:55] yeah i don't know
[1:35:58] i might be a part of that final
[1:35:59] preparation you might be a part of it it
[1:36:01] doesn't matter aids doesn't matter
[1:36:04] amen aids doesn't matter although
[1:36:06] i do believe it would be more along the
[1:36:08] lines of someone who is beyond
[1:36:10] the age of accountability
[1:36:13] but
[1:36:14] that's god's determination
[1:36:16] god does the final preparations
[1:36:19] let's just continue to live that godly
[1:36:22] holy christian life
[1:36:25] and let and be that example to be that
[1:36:28] one god
[1:36:30] has made us to be
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:33] there should never be a time when we
[1:36:35] become apathetic
[1:36:36] never should there be a time where we
[1:36:38] think all there's no more souls can be
[1:36:39] saved don't ever brother graham said
[1:36:42] don't ever think like that
[1:36:44] should never be a time where we stop
[1:36:45] ministering before we stop being a
[1:36:47] reflection of christ or stop trying to
[1:36:49] help somebody come to christ don't ever
[1:36:52] we should never get to that place
[1:36:55] i know years ago it was just like a
[1:36:57] spirit that weighed through and people
[1:36:59] started preaching that blow off the
[1:37:01] mercy seat there's nothing but judgment
[1:37:02] and
[1:37:03] no more souls saved than that and
[1:37:05] and people become apathetic
[1:37:07] they didn't want to try to go win souls
[1:37:09] to christ anymore and
[1:37:12] they didn't want to
[1:37:13] uh continue on the process that god gave
[1:37:16] us in his scripture to fulfill
[1:37:19] because it just well it's it's over
[1:37:21] well if it's over then it's over no no
[1:37:24] god is still working and and he's still
[1:37:28] producing
[1:37:29] the results
[1:37:30] the finalized results are going to be
[1:37:32] god's doing
[1:37:34] amen
[1:37:36] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:37:48] i believe we're at the end
[1:37:51] i really do i believe we're the place
[1:37:55] that we've been looking for that we've
[1:37:56] been expecting
[1:38:05] for
[1:38:06] really mo all of our christian life at
[1:38:09] least
[1:38:11] looking for those finalized results
[1:38:14] looking for
[1:38:18] the preparations god has made for us
[1:38:21] there's always in every major event in
[1:38:23] the scripture there's always been
[1:38:25] the preparation that god prepares his
