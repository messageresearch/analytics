[9:05] toe and the next the toe next to it
[9:07] together or something but uh they don't
[9:10] never know to do surgery anything like

[29:51] election sure for if you do these things
[29:54] you shall never fallen you could be
[29:57] seated if you like right amen God bless
[29:59] the reading of his word today again
[30:01] we're going to uh uh we we went through
[30:04] faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[30:07] patience now we're getting into
[30:08] godliness
[30:11] um a lot like Temperance and patience
[30:15] intertwined a good bit not that all of
[30:17] them don't and of course all of them
[30:19] build off of Faith uh but as Temperance
[30:23] and patience kind of coupled together uh
[30:25] more so so does God in and brotherly
[30:29] kindness uh many scriptures of course uh
[30:32] of the ones the few that I read there's
[30:35] obviously those who are Bible readers
[30:37] those who know your Bible know there's
[30:39] many more places many more scriptures
[30:41] many more incidences that we could go
[30:43] into and read that are uh uh in effect
[30:48] uh fall in line with these virtues with
[30:51] these attributes uh I just pick a few
[30:54] out I I find a few the things that the
[30:56] Lord put on my heart uh things that the
[30:59] Lord may show me and study and those are
[31:01] the things I write down uh it reminds me
[31:04] that time when brother green talked
[31:05] about uh brother brandham and how he got
[31:07] a message and uh he said uh uh he said
[31:12] he would get a subject or a topic the
[31:14] Lord would give he feel the Lord give
[31:16] him and and a scripture and then uh he
[31:18] go look and find this scripture and it
[31:20] goes with this scripture and he goes and
[31:22] he finds this scripture and he goes with
[31:23] this scripture and brother R told
[31:25] Brother green says you think you're
[31:27] getting lucky lucky he said but that's
[31:29] the Lord guiding you that's the Lord
[31:31] leading you that's the Lord showing you
[31:33] and putting on in your mind in your
[31:35] rembrance things that that that help
[31:38] that that God wants to be said that God
[31:40] wants to be
[31:42] illuminated uh again so many things that
[31:45] we could read on each subject so many
[31:47] things in the scripture obviously this
[31:49] Bible full of the all of attributes but
[31:51] those things that are that are uh that
[31:54] that are in God's mind to bring to
[31:56] illuminate for that period of time for
[31:58] that specific subject for that specific
[32:00] reason and sometimes for a specific
[32:03] person that's in that service for a
[32:05] specific person that may be watching or
[32:07] may watch archives you don't know but
[32:10] the Lord gives those things for reason
[32:12] the purpose and that's why you look and
[32:16] you say well why didn't you read that
[32:18] scripture or I could think of that
[32:20] scripture to go to that uh I only do
[32:22] what I feel the Lord puts on my heart to
[32:24] do I write down the notes if the Lord
[32:26] gives it to me I put it there read it
[32:28] sometimes it gives me something standing
[32:30] here and and we go into that but it's
[32:32] whatever he wants that's that's what we
[32:34] want the most of amen and that in itself
[32:38] for all of us not just a minister but
[32:40] for all of us is uh an attribute of
[32:44] godliness it is an attribute of
[32:46] godliness that God would put in entrust
[32:49] in you his own word the truth of his own
[32:51] word amen he doesn't want his uh his
[32:55] word Trampled Under feet his word is PR
[32:57] precious amen that's why we don't cast
[33:00] our Pearl Before Swine we make sure that
[33:02] we that we do it is according to the
[33:05] Lord and then the Lord takes care of
[33:06] that praise the Lord I've had some
[33:08] people ask me before said well uh why
[33:10] don't you tell so somebody so and so
[33:13] such and such that's well uh didn't come
[33:17] to me to say and I'm not going to say it
[33:18] if it doesn't come to me to say because
[33:20] there's a reason for that uh why didn't
[33:22] you talk to that person well uh the Lord
[33:25] didn't un me to talk to that person
[33:28] uh yeah they may not be a believer but
[33:30] maybe they are and somebody else down
[33:32] the road supposed to be ordained to talk
[33:33] to I don't know that's up to God that's
[33:35] not up to me so how could you not be
[33:37] ordained to talk to him you're a
[33:38] Believer it's in God's hands not mine
[33:41] yes I've told you several times I had
[33:44] I've had people in the car and some
[33:45] people I witnessed a lot some people
[33:48] witnessed a little bit um and sometimes
[33:53] I would get done and leave a person I'm
[33:54] thinking my why didn't I say that my why
[33:57] didn't I say one night uh I I dropped a
[34:00] guy off and we had good discussion
[34:02] always from the airport had good
[34:04] discussion took him way up to Oro Valley
[34:07] and uh and when we got done I I was
[34:10] pulling out and I thought wow why didn't
[34:12] I say that then I thought why didn't I
[34:13] say that not why there's like two or
[34:15] three things that come to me after I
[34:17] dropped him off I thought why didn't I
[34:19] say that now why I said Lord why didn't
[34:21] I say that and the Lord came back to me
[34:23] and said because it I didn't give it to
[34:25] you to tell him it wasn't for you to
[34:28] tell him um now he gave me a reason I'll
[34:31] keep that to myself but uh it's the
[34:35] obedience to the Lord and and God has a
[34:38] way of doing that now if that fell down
[34:40] the road if somebody else maybe I'll see
[34:42] him again down there I don't know I
[34:44] probably wouldn't remember him but
[34:46] anyway you never know it's up to the
[34:48] Lord that's what matters the most and
[34:50] again that that all is a part of of of
[34:55] godliness in your life of God in your
[34:58] life Jesus never wasted a single word
[35:02] Jesus never did anything that didn't
[35:04] have a purpose Jesus never went anyone
[35:07] or did anywhere didn't speak to anyone
[35:10] if there wasn't a reason Jesus himself
[35:12] said I only do what the father shows me
[35:15] and what he shows me that's what I'm
[35:16] going to do amen that's godliness uh
[35:20] well that does that didn't end when
[35:22] Jesus Christ passed away amen it didn't
[35:25] end when brother Brandon passed away
[35:27] amen uh didn't begin when brother
[35:28] brandom was born it's been here it's
[35:31] always been here it's still here and
[35:32] it's for every one of us to fall as a
[35:34] part of godliness the reverence to be
[35:37] holy to be like God piety if you will a
[35:40] lot of piety I sometimes piety has kind
[35:44] of a negative connotation with the fake
[35:48] piety or fake Holiness or pretend
[35:50] Holiness but uh to be reverent to be
[35:53] holy Godly living that life being the
[35:56] one that God can use Amen to produce his
[36:01] life on this Earth again to be an
[36:04] individual that God can live through
[36:06] that God can speak through these hands
[36:08] should be God's hands these feet should
[36:10] be God's feet this voice should be God's
[36:13] voice what we do what we say how we act
[36:16] where we go Jesus again never wasted a
[36:19] single syllable what he spoke had
[36:22] purpose had meaning had reason to be
[36:24] said everywhere he went everything he
[36:26] did now I know it's not that necessarily
[36:30] to that degree for us amen but uh but in
[36:35] in the percentage or in the placement of
[36:38] of of God leading us the footsteps of a
[36:41] righteous man are ordered of God yes and
[36:43] being led of God and doing the things
[36:45] that God would have us do see we all
[36:47] have a purpose we all have a reason for
[36:50] being here we all have our unique ways
[36:52] we all have our unique upbringings we
[36:55] all have our unique uh ways of
[36:57] representing things or personalities or
[37:00] or or things that we do I I think that's
[37:02] a lot of the reason why God has a
[37:04] five-fold Ministry there's there there's
[37:07] men that God raised in a way that uh
[37:10] they their their gift is to to teach to
[37:14] be a to be a teacher and there's people
[37:17] that have that gift that can just lay
[37:19] that word out and teach it and and bring
[37:22] it in a way where people can understand
[37:24] it right bring it in a way where people
[37:26] where it comes forth not just with the
[37:28] spirit but with a gift of understanding
[37:31] that people can receive it amen same
[37:34] with pastors same with uh evangelists
[37:37] whatnot uh you know God to me God likes
[37:41] a a fire under an evangelist or a
[37:44] missionary lights a fire under him to go
[37:46] send him go preach the gospel go
[37:48] wherever God sends you I know it's kind
[37:51] of squelching in this last days but
[37:53] that's what that's what that purpose is
[37:55] for amen is to be able to do that and
[37:58] every one of us are a part of a Ministry
[38:01] every one of us are are are in our own
[38:04] way that part of God that God put in you
[38:09] to send you forth to do the purpose and
[38:12] the point uh the place that God wants
[38:14] you to do that God wants you to be that
[38:18] people that God wants you to meet the
[38:20] life that God wants you to live amen I I
[38:23] I know we're probably not to the place
[38:25] of wasting a syllable or of verse or or
[38:28] or a sentence uh like Jesus but the
[38:31] godliness that God gives us the Holiness
[38:34] the righteousness uh the reverence to be
[38:37] like God you say how do I be like God
[38:40] best way I know is to read the Bible
[38:42] amen yes and and exemplify everything he
[38:46] did that's the best way because Jesus is
[38:49] God in flesh well who better to learn of
[38:52] how to be God than God himself Amen to
[38:56] know it to read it to let that word uh
[39:00] uh permeate through your life Jesus
[39:02] himself said in Matthew 5:48 and we've
[39:05] said this scripture a couple of times
[39:07] over the past few weeks be ye therefore
[39:09] perfect even as your father which is in
[39:12] heaven is perfect again that is not
[39:15] sinless Perfection amen like he was
[39:18] sinless Perfection but that is the
[39:21] maturity that's to grow up that's to let
[39:24] that is to let the godliness uh uh uh of
[39:27] of who he is who his attributes are live
[39:30] through you yeah that's what being
[39:33] perfect is it's not being sinless it's
[39:36] living your life in a way that that
[39:39] produces Jesus Christ in flesh again yes
[39:43] amen amen in the maturity and and and in
[39:46] the
[39:47] adulthood and the Snapping I know uh I
[39:50] don't know if they're watching but you
[39:52] know when you're kids I know when our
[39:54] kids were kids I know when I was kids uh
[39:57] when I was a kid and and my sister was a
[40:00] good bit older than I was but even when
[40:02] I was getting you know uh before I
[40:04] became a teenager it's always we fuss
[40:06] and fight all the time bicker that's
[40:09] that's that was my dad always we just
[40:11] bicker uh not necessarily fighting we
[40:14] never called it fighting although we did
[40:16] fight a couple of times but bicker back
[40:18] and forth
[40:19] Just and that's but when you grow up you
[40:22] don't you don't get to that uh we kept
[40:25] the grandkids last week and you know
[40:28] Joel and Em are brother and sister and
[40:30] uh have to ask me they fight no I don't
[40:32] fight they just they they just bicker
[40:35] you know back and forth I know Gabriel
[40:38] and Alice don't do that you know but
[40:40] bicker just just back and forth just
[40:43] like a woodpecker on a tree back and
[40:46] forth and and and just bicker and back
[40:48] and but see when you become a mature
[40:50] Christian that all that all that goes
[40:53] away uh there's there's no bickering
[40:56] there's no just
[40:57] trying to prove that you're right all
[40:59] the time or trying to pro pro prove a
[41:02] point all the time I think I may have
[41:04] told you this story one time I was uh uh
[41:07] back East I I went around a lot because
[41:09] I wasn't pastoring until I went to
[41:11] Florida uh but would go to different
[41:14] services and Minister different places
[41:16] and go to special meetings and things
[41:18] like that it was always always happening
[41:20] in the South North Carolina South
[41:22] Carolina Georgia around Tennessee in
[41:23] that area uh it was always something
[41:25] going on going to different meetings and
[41:27] stuff and um and it was just like
[41:30] there's always these there was these
[41:32] camps like and I I just remember this
[41:36] one specific time my wife wasn't with me
[41:38] but we went to a shony and uh these two
[41:41] brothers they just could not leave each
[41:43] other alone they had differing opinions
[41:46] they had differing views uh I honestly
[41:50] 30 years later don't even remember it
[41:52] what it was about but I remember the
[41:54] bickering was so bad and the and the and
[41:56] the con back and forth they were drawing
[41:59] the attention of people all around us
[42:01] and I'm sitting here thinking instead of
[42:03] talking about Jesus Christ and edifying
[42:06] God and bringing his presence in our
[42:08] fellowship all they did was fuss and
[42:11] fight and bicker to where all the people
[42:12] around us looking at thinking no those
[42:14] people
[42:15] Christians there there're they're
[42:17] they're supposed to be Christians
[42:18] they're over there fighting bickering
[42:20] and complaining and at one another and
[42:22] back and forth and trying to prove each
[42:24] other wrong but this that and just just
[42:26] be a brother I mean if the Lord puts
[42:28] something on your heart to say or
[42:29] mention or a scripture or something or
[42:31] quote that's one thing but just to
[42:32] bicker back and forth and that's when
[42:34] they reminded me that same thing back
[42:37] and forth just back and forth and P but
[42:41] see the thing of it was there was no
[42:43] godliness to that because everybody
[42:46] around us all the people in the
[42:47] restaurant I noticed cuz I I wasn't a
[42:49] part of the bickering I wasn't going to
[42:51] I I don't I don't do that I don't to get
[42:53] into that in fact uh most of the time I
[42:56] refrain from going to all the ministers
[42:58] meetings they used to have back there
[42:59] because all they ended up doing was
[43:00] fighting and I'm not going to do that so
[43:03] uh I know I know in whom I believe I
[43:05] know what I believe uh what I believe
[43:08] the Lord has revealed to me if the
[43:09] Lord's revealed it to me you're
[43:11] definitely not going to talk me out of
[43:12] it so why what's the point if we're not
[43:14] going to stand there and be brothers and
[43:16] love one another and fellowship then
[43:18] everybody in the restaurant or not
[43:20] everybody but a lot of people especially
[43:22] right were just kept looking and as we
[43:24] got up and walked out they kept adding
[43:27] each other walking out of the restaurant
[43:29] and everybody we passed by everybody's
[43:31] looking over thinking these two and
[43:33] they're supposed to be Christians just
[43:35] fighting just bickering back and forth
[43:37] and they're supposed to be Christians I
[43:39] thought this is not the kind of example
[43:41] that we should leave for these people in
[43:43] this restaurant this is not the way that
[43:45] we should conduct ourselves with each
[43:47] other even in
[43:49] private with each other I know the Bible
[43:52] says to uh to uh uh to to reason
[43:56] together I I I understand that but
[43:59] contention bring Pride brings contention
[44:02] T contention brings strife and strife
[44:04] brings anger and anger is not the
[44:06] emotion that we should be uh bringing up
[44:09] in our lives or in front of people yeah
[44:12] so it was it was just the opposite of
[44:15] what we're supposed to be it's just the
[44:16] opposite of this scripture be therefore
[44:19] perfect just the opposite of of of being
[44:22] mature being a grownup Christian amen
[44:26] nothing wrong with giving your point of
[44:27] view nothing wrong with giving a
[44:28] scripture or something like that but
[44:30] just a constant bickering back and forth
[44:32] it accomp and I and honestly we went to
[44:34] our cars accomplished absolutely nothing
[44:37] as far as I could see of what happened
[44:40] then and in the future never
[44:41] accomplished a thing except for all
[44:44] those people in that restaurant that
[44:45] night thought we must have been
[44:47] crazy we did not produce Jesus Christ in
[44:51] front of anybody in that restaurant that
[44:53] night and that's a sad thing yes amen
[44:56] should not be that that way it should be
[44:59] everywhere we go and in everybody's
[45:01] presence we meet they should realize
[45:04] that there's a presence there of Jesus
[45:06] Christ yes amen not just you not just me
[45:11] but there's a presence there amen they
[45:13] may not know what it is they may not
[45:16] recognize fully but they can know and
[45:19] acknowledge there's something different
[45:21] amen there's something different about
[45:23] that may not say anything but realize
[45:26] there's something different that's
[45:27] producing that godliness amen the
[45:31] maturity the the the the level of and
[45:34] and also maturity in this godliness also
[45:36] brings us to a point of recognizing what
[45:39] we do with the word brother bam said
[45:42] that this bride will have thus sayith
[45:45] the Lord oh she'll keep quiet right amen
[45:48] she'll have thus sayith the Lord oh
[45:49] she'll keep quiet that's a discipline
[45:52] that's a maturity that's a level of
[45:54] perfection right amen of knowing when to
[45:58] talk when not to talk when to do when
[46:00] not to do how to handle the word amen
[46:03] how to handle the word appropriately
[46:06] properly Godly handle it in the way that
[46:08] is according to the Lord's perfect will
[46:11] not what we want not what we see because
[46:14] friendly TR TR truth be told friends my
[46:17] desire and what I would do is try to
[46:19] have everybody in the world hear it from
[46:22] me and be saved right that's not God's
[46:25] plan that's not going to happen
[46:27] I would want it to be that way that's my
[46:29] desire but see we don't operate by our
[46:32] desires this Perfection this godliness
[46:35] is knowing what to do with the word yes
[46:38] how to handle the word there were times
[46:39] that Jesus came into situations to where
[46:43] uh he had said his part he had done his
[46:45] part he had done what the Lord told him
[46:47] to do and then he was
[46:49] gone amen sometimes they were coming to
[46:52] Stone him and kill him and they just he
[46:54] just disappeared out of their midst he
[46:56] was no longer long there you imagine
[46:58] coming up to Stone somebody and all of a
[46:59] sudden you look around they're nowhere
[47:01] to be found I don't know about you but I
[47:04] think I'd have dropped my rock and head
[47:05] for my house and said I'd have crawled
[47:07] under my bed or something and said Lord
[47:09] forgive me this is this is not normal
[47:12] this is not human for somebody to be
[47:14] standing right there getting ready to be
[47:16] stoned and you no and they're there and
[47:18] they're not there anymore I'd say
[47:20] there's a greater power going on Lord
[47:22] getting me out of here but there's
[47:24] there's an anointing to these things too
[47:27] yeah amen there's an anointing that goes
[47:29] on I noticed it probably this year uh
[47:33] more than ever even in politics there's
[47:35] an anointing going on it it and it it
[47:38] reminds me uh that God's in control yeah
[47:42] it reminds me that it's up to God uh it
[47:46] reminds me that whoever's supposed to be
[47:48] in a in a a leadership position uh God
[47:52] puts them up and God sets them down it's
[47:54] up to the Lord yeah amen and we know
[47:57] where we're at in this world today
[47:58] friends and if it's at that point then
[48:01] that's up to God it does it great
[48:03] against my flesh you better believe it
[48:06] does uh I I can't stand to see it like
[48:09] that but it's got to happen it's going
[48:12] to happen yes is it now I don't know
[48:15] that's up to the Lord uh but it very
[48:17] well could be I feel like it's that
[48:19] close I think we all feel that way yeah
[48:22] but a part of the godliness that we have
[48:24] is knowing by the will of the Lord that
[48:27] God would show us what it is and what it
[48:31] isn't see what's true what's false
[48:33] what's right and what's not a lot of the
[48:35] gifts of the Spirit operate in that in
[48:38] in that way the gifts of the Spirit
[48:40] operate because of the godliness amen H
[48:44] How can there be somebody come to judge
[48:47] say a prophecy or something unless
[48:49] there's something of God there to do it
[48:51] with there's got to be a gift there's
[48:53] got to be a god there there's got to be
[48:55] the the purpose of God manifesting
[48:58] itself to show what is that truth and
[49:00] what is that and what is that fake what
[49:03] is not real uh what is just somebody uh
[49:07] there's probably a lot of them out today
[49:08] I don't accuse anybody anything but
[49:10] there's probably a lot of them out there
[49:12] today that just uh just throw wads of
[49:15] paper against the wall and see what
[49:17] sticks amen maybe I'll get one of one
[49:20] out of a thousand right and if I get one
[49:22] out of a thousand right man I'll be uh
[49:26] uh I'll I'll be worshiped and I I'll be
[49:28] known as this great person but godliness
[49:31] is not that way right amen godliness
[49:34] doesn't miss the mark godliness is right
[49:37] on every time amen that's why you can
[49:40] look and see at the prophecies and the
[49:42] the the visions and things of brother
[49:44] Bram every single one right on the mark
[49:47] true even to the ones that haven't come
[49:49] to pass yet or going to and about some
[49:52] maybe even about to come to pass amen
[49:55] but God knows amen it's up to God it's
[49:58] it's God's choice uh another form of
[50:01] godliness go over let's go over to Acts
[50:04] chapter
[50:09] 3 so much of the godliness that brings
[50:11] us into brings into
[50:14] perspective uh how we live our lives yes
[50:17] amen and how much we let God have
[50:20] control over our lives yes how much of
[50:23] our lives are
[50:25] me or is me how much of my life is me
[50:30] and how much of my life is God right how
[50:33] much of your life is you and how much of
[50:36] it is God now humans we all want to have
[50:39] control we're control freaks whether we
[50:41] want admit it or not we all want to have
[50:43] control we want to have control over
[50:46] everything of our lives and feel like if
[50:47] we've got things under control then
[50:50] everything's going to be okay but see
[50:52] you're having control over something has
[50:54] nothing to do whether something
[50:56] something's going to be okay or not in
[50:58] fact a lot of times we feel like we have
[51:01] control over something that we don't
[51:03] even know what's going to happen
[51:04] tomorrow right that's why it's so much
[51:07] better to let someone have control over
[51:10] it that knows what is tomorrow amen that
[51:14] is true control not fake or false
[51:17] control but we're humans we all want
[51:19] control over things but it comes down to
[51:23] how much I'm willing to let Jesus Christ
[51:26] live through me how much am I willing to
[51:28] die how much am I willing of to let how
[51:32] much of new minute willing to
[51:35] die how much of my will how much of my
[51:40] desire how much of my purpose how much
[51:42] of my ideals do I want to die and rot
[51:46] and go away so whatever Jesus whatever
[51:49] God in his eternal purpose has in my
[51:53] life can live through me because there
[51:56] got to be something live through me if
[51:58] Newton Bennett is dying then there's got
[52:01] to be something else live through it
[52:03] amen and a lot of people die out to the
[52:06] devil and they've died out to themselves
[52:09] and they live the life they want to live
[52:11] according to the devil moving in their
[52:13] lives I want God Living Through Me amen
[52:16] I want the Lord to live his life in
[52:20] me more of us to die so more of him can
[52:24] live amen it's not my will but thine be
[52:28] done that Eternal prayer that Jesus
[52:31] prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane when
[52:32] his sweat was so agonizingly large it
[52:37] was as drops of blood falling onto the
[52:39] ground but yet he cried not my will but
[52:43] thine be done amen amen praise the Lord
[52:46] let's go to acts now I said I had you
[52:48] turn to Acts chapter 3 Let's just begin
[52:51] reading with verse
[52:53] one having just come out amen
[52:57] of the upper room acts 238 the great
[52:59] decree that Peter gave repent be
[53:01] baptized receive the gift of the Holy
[53:03] Ghost now acts
[53:05] 31 acts 3:1 starts entering into their
[53:09] life amen Peter's life the disciples
[53:12] life those in the upper room uh their
[53:15] lives are starting to begin now they're
[53:17] they're they're new creatures in Christ
[53:20] Jesus they are born again their life
[53:23] their old ways their old life is dead
[53:27] now they're new life now they're
[53:28] starting their life out what do they do
[53:30] they go to church
[53:32] right Peter and John went up together
[53:35] into the temple at The Hour of Prayer
[53:38] being the ninth hour amen that they
[53:40] didn't do
[53:42] anything out of the ordinary just per se
[53:45] they didn't go out of their way to do
[53:47] anything they just started Living their
[53:49] life that's all God expects of us you
[53:52] say godliness is being a monk or whom
[53:55] and you know sitting in a room all day
[53:57] or bowing or beating yourself whatever
[54:01] people think is godliness uh doing
[54:04] something of of reverence or
[54:07] whatever that's not godliness godliness
[54:10] is living your life yes living the life
[54:14] that God gave you if you're not going to
[54:16] live the life God gave you then what's
[54:18] the point in having that life right amen
[54:21] right amen they just live their lives
[54:25] you just live your life
[54:27] amen you just living in a way that God
[54:30] lived it Jesus didn't lock himself in a
[54:32] room and just pray
[54:36] 247 uh he lived his life amen Peter and
[54:41] John now the disciples they're living
[54:43] their life now Peter and John went to
[54:45] the temple at The Hour of Prayer being
[54:47] the ninth hour and a certain man lay
[54:50] from his mother's womb was carried whom
[54:53] they laid daily at the Gate of the
[54:55] temple which is called all beautiful to
[54:57] ask arms of them that entered into the
[54:59] temple who seeing Peter and John about
[55:02] to go uh go into the temple asked in
[55:05] arms and Peter fasting his eyes upon him
[55:09] with John said look on
[55:12] us he gave heed unto them expecting to
[55:15] receive something of them then Peter
[55:18] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[55:23] such as I have give give I
[55:28] Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[55:31] Nazareth rise up and walk amen just a
[55:36] part of his life I don't have any great
[55:39] riches I'm not Wealthy by any stretch of
[55:41] the imagination I have a dollar here or
[55:43] there but I don't have silver and gold
[55:45] but I do have something that will be of
[55:48] a benefit to you instead of giving you a
[55:51] fish so you can eat today I'm going to
[55:53] show you how to fish Hallelujah that you
[55:55] can eat the rest of your
[55:57] life in the name of Jesus Christ of
[56:01] Nazareth get up on your feet and walk
[56:04] amen that was something that Peter did
[56:07] have amen he didn't have cars houses
[56:10] lands riches silver gold no but what he
[56:14] did have he was able to give amen what
[56:18] we do have we are able to give amen it's
[56:23] God manifests in US
[56:26] that life and all that encompasses that
[56:29] life such as we still have today now I
[56:34] don't think a a part of godliness is
[56:38] also knowing when to do something you
[56:41] know brother random said that power
[56:43] without character is satanic right the
[56:47] character is what the character is
[56:49] having the Life of Christ the character
[56:51] is knowing when to do it where to do it
[56:54] who to do it maybe if it involves it
[56:57] involves every one of these aspects of
[57:00] it to be able to
[57:02] control the circumstance to match God's
[57:05] perfect will now I don't think for one
[57:09] second that Peter did this to show off
[57:13] he didn't do this to try to make himself
[57:15] a name he didn't do this just off of his
[57:17] own accord I believe the Lord moved him
[57:20] to do this yes the Lord moved on the
[57:23] Holy Spirit moved on Peter to do this or
[57:25] he would not have done it it's like
[57:27] Jesus the godliness of Jesus now this
[57:31] this may be hard for some people to
[57:32] swallow Saints but the godl the
[57:36] godliness of Jesus caused him to step
[57:41] over dozens and dozens and dozens of
[57:45] sick people lame Hal sick some even from
[57:49] their birth he walked all around them
[57:52] and all over them to get to one person
[57:55] right M that was the godliness in Jesus
[57:59] Christ to go to that one person so well
[58:02] he's God why didn't he go and lay hands
[58:04] on everybody that wasn't God's will
[58:06] right amen May some of them may have at
[58:09] some point got their healing maybe some
[58:11] of them were able to even get into the
[58:13] pool and get their healing amen this man
[58:16] was unable nobody could put him in the
[58:18] pool he could not physically get in the
[58:20] pool so somebody always beat him there
[58:22] at the troubling of the waters somebody
[58:24] always beat him in that pool
[58:26] so he wasn't able but Jesus the god
[58:30] listen to me now the godliness of Jesus
[58:33] stepped over all those sick people just
[58:36] to get to one
[58:38] man amen and when that man was healed
[58:41] he's when when that when Jesus got to
[58:43] that man he said why do you want to be
[58:46] healed amen what what's the point why do
[58:49] you why do you want to be healed I think
[58:51] it's a lot the same today yes people ask
[58:55] all the time well why do you want to be
[58:57] healed why do you want to be made whole
[58:59] yes amen some people I'm I'm sure
[59:04] probably even on the street today
[59:07] they're probably content with begging
[59:09] and living in a ditch that's how they
[59:12] live their life they they want to be
[59:14] that
[59:15] way they want to beg their alms all the
[59:18] time what's the point what are you going
[59:20] to if if God heals you what are you
[59:22] going to do how are you going to live
[59:24] your life yes amen that's a part of
[59:27] godliness but Jesus stepped over every
[59:30] one of them just to go to that one
[59:31] person take up thy bed and walk amen
[59:36] take up thy bed and walk it's time for
[59:39] you to go forth and do for
[59:41] yourself it's time for you to go forth
[59:44] and live your life to be an example of
[59:47] God Almighty to to let that life lived
[59:51] through you to to let your life be an
[59:55] example
[59:57] of of who God is through his perfect
[1:00:00] will now some people won't see that as
[1:00:03] godliness right people in their own
[1:00:06] minds their own intellect faults will
[1:00:07] think how could God do that how could
[1:00:11] Jesus
[1:00:13] Christ with the ability with the ability
[1:00:16] to heal everyone in there everyone walk
[1:00:20] over every one of them except for one
[1:00:23] person but that's God's godliness some a
[1:00:26] lot of people wouldn't agree with that
[1:00:28] amen a lot of times people say well why
[1:00:30] did why did God allow this and why does
[1:00:33] God allow that and why is these people
[1:00:36] sick and why are these people hungry and
[1:00:38] why did this war happen and why is this
[1:00:40] have people always but they blame it all
[1:00:42] on God you know why God why does God
[1:00:46] allow this to happen friends this is not
[1:00:49] this is not heaven we are not in a place
[1:00:52] of Utopia we are on earth we are in a
[1:00:55] place with with with Satan's Eden with
[1:00:58] the serpent seed and and men with free
[1:01:01] will right to do what they want how they
[1:01:04] want where they want when they want but
[1:01:07] God takes care of his own amen God takes
[1:01:11] care of his own the godliness of
[1:01:15] Peter came out as this guy looked and I
[1:01:17] believe this this had to be the will of
[1:01:19] the Lord amen you you don't you don't
[1:01:23] just could Jesus have walked into a
[1:01:26] hospital and emptied it out
[1:01:28] absolutely amen could could a Believer
[1:01:31] today with that same Authority do the
[1:01:34] same thing absolutely I believe that
[1:01:36] 100% right amen but not if it's not
[1:01:39] according to the will of the Lord and we
[1:01:42] shouldn't even try to do it if it's not
[1:01:43] according to the will of the Lord we
[1:01:45] pray for one another that's godliness to
[1:01:48] pray for one another in the spirit
[1:01:50] fervent effectual prayer for righteous
[1:01:52] man ofth much in the spirit of God
[1:01:55] brings forth results we believe that
[1:01:58] absolutely cuz that's the commission we
[1:02:00] all have amen but that's up to God Amen
[1:02:03] that God's purpose God's will now I
[1:02:06] believe that Peter would not have done
[1:02:09] this if it hadn't been something in him
[1:02:12] the Holy Ghost to move him to do this to
[1:02:14] look on look on us Silver and Gold Have
[1:02:17] I num but such as I have I give to you
[1:02:19] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:02:22] rise up and walk and he took him by the
[1:02:25] right hand verse he took him by the
[1:02:28] right hand and lifted him up and
[1:02:31] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:02:34] receive strength when did they receive
[1:02:36] strength after he acted on that prayer
[1:02:40] and
[1:02:41] Faith amen he didn't just sat there just
[1:02:44] lay there and all of a sudden his feet
[1:02:46] came forth no he grabbed him by the hand
[1:02:49] and he began to rise up and as he did
[1:02:52] the healing began to manifest itself in
[1:02:54] his body amen and he receives strength
[1:02:58] in his feet and ankle bones he rece they
[1:03:00] receive strength and he
[1:03:03] leaping leaping up stood and walked and
[1:03:06] entered with them into the temple
[1:03:08] walking and leaping and praising God
[1:03:11] Amen praise it there you go there's the
[1:03:14] results we're looking for yes amen not
[1:03:17] just somebody that's going to leap for
[1:03:19] joy and be happy about it and go to the
[1:03:21] local bar no right Le be happy pra God
[1:03:26] and go to church and went into the
[1:03:29] temple together to Worship the Lord amen
[1:03:32] that's what healing is about praise the
[1:03:34] Lord brings you in a place to live the
[1:03:36] life that God's ordained you to live yes
[1:03:39] and all the people saw him walking and
[1:03:42] praising God and they and this is what
[1:03:44] we were talking about earlier the
[1:03:45] perplexity that some people a lot of
[1:03:47] people have about God the moving of God
[1:03:51] and the will of God and the purpose of
[1:03:52] God a lot of people don't understand it
[1:03:55] yes people don't want to understand but
[1:03:57] a lot of people don't won't understand
[1:03:59] it they look and see all these people
[1:04:01] saw walking and praising God and they
[1:04:02] knew they knew that he was uh that it
[1:04:06] was he which set for arms at the
[1:04:08] beautiful gate of the temple and they
[1:04:10] were filled with wonder and amazement at
[1:04:13] that w at that which had happened unto
[1:04:16] him and as the lame man which was held
[1:04:20] uh which was healed held Peter and John
[1:04:23] all the people ran together unto to them
[1:04:26] in the porch that is called Solomon's
[1:04:28] greatly
[1:04:30] wondering what had happened amen it's a
[1:04:35] wonder that's why you see healing
[1:04:38] sometimes I think today for us and we
[1:04:41] give God glory but it's
[1:04:44] not
[1:04:45] wow how did that happen it's like praise
[1:04:50] God Amen it's just God moving yeah the
[1:04:55] super natural should come to us to be a
[1:04:58] natural act the supernatural for the
[1:05:00] bride should be something that's very
[1:05:02] natural it shouldn't be something that's
[1:05:04] just an outstanding thing to think wow
[1:05:06] that's that's we praise God we're happy
[1:05:10] about it but we're not in amazement
[1:05:14] because we know God we know the power of
[1:05:16] God we know the healing Virtues Of God
[1:05:19] we know what God does it's not amazing
[1:05:21] to us we know that's shouldn't say it's
[1:05:24] not it is amazing but it's not like wow
[1:05:26] how did that happen we know because we
[1:05:30] know God Amen all these people they're
[1:05:33] in great amazement
[1:05:35] wondering how has this guy that's been
[1:05:37] there his whole life has now come forth
[1:05:40] he's walking he's dancing he's jumping
[1:05:42] he's leaping he's praising God and he's
[1:05:44] going over to Peter and
[1:05:46] John and when Peter saw it last verse
[1:05:49] now I'm going to read he said he
[1:05:50] answered unto the people ye men of
[1:05:53] Israel why Marvel ye at this or why look
[1:05:57] ye so earnestly on us as though by our
[1:06:00] own power or Holiness we had made this
[1:06:04] man to
[1:06:05] walk praise
[1:06:08] God what is this wonderful great thing
[1:06:11] this Supernatural miracle that God
[1:06:14] performed not just healing but miracle
[1:06:17] that God performed how is it followed up
[1:06:20] with great
[1:06:21] humility amen great humil why are you
[1:06:24] looking on us like we're something right
[1:06:27] why are you looking like like I did this
[1:06:29] of my own accord
[1:06:32] like of my own
[1:06:34] power Peter's like how could I couldn't
[1:06:37] have done this amen and then of course
[1:06:39] he goes on to give him a nice message
[1:06:41] and tell him Jesus Christ you crucified
[1:06:44] is the same one that raised this man and
[1:06:45] made him
[1:06:46] well same one that you don't want to
[1:06:48] have anything to do with same one you
[1:06:50] didn't ever want to listen to same one
[1:06:52] you ignored and crucified is the same
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:56] that healed this man and he's in here
[1:06:58] now producing revealing he is still God
[1:07:02] that's how it that's how it happened now
[1:07:05] repent he said there you go see the
[1:07:09] whole purpose behind it the whole
[1:07:11] purpose Paul and Silas were in misery
[1:07:14] Saints when they were in the innermost
[1:07:16] prison but when they began to praise and
[1:07:17] worship God and God begin to move that
[1:07:20] prison there was a reason for it God
[1:07:22] didn't just loose them just to be loosed
[1:07:25] he didn't loose all the prison just to
[1:07:26] be loose there was a reason behind it
[1:07:30] there was people that needed salvation
[1:07:32] there was people there that needed to
[1:07:34] know God and when they saw this miracle
[1:07:38] happen and they saw God move in such a
[1:07:41] supernatural way right in front of their
[1:07:43] eyes it was it was a time to preach
[1:07:47] repentance amen now now Peter said if
[1:07:51] you read on
[1:07:52] repent repent you all and come to Jesus
[1:07:56] Christ amen the same God that made this
[1:07:59] man whole is the same God that'll make
[1:08:01] you whole praise the Lord because
[1:08:03] there's a lot more making hold of
[1:08:06] importance than just a physical healing
[1:08:08] yeah amen spiritual healing is number
[1:08:11] one obviously amen but there's so much
[1:08:15] more healing in life than just physical
[1:08:17] healing I know we made you on that all
[1:08:19] the time in physical healings and
[1:08:21] miracles and things but there's a whole
[1:08:23] lot more things that uh that God does
[1:08:26] that's even Beyond just physical healing
[1:08:29] now let's go over I want to read this
[1:08:31] one more scripture First Timothy chapter
[1:08:36] 6 amen 1 Timothy chapter 6 now there is
[1:08:39] a people that have a form of godliness
[1:08:43] they have a form of godliness but they
[1:08:45] deny the power yes they deny God himself
[1:08:50] because if you deny the power of God
[1:08:51] you've denied God because any part of
[1:08:54] God that we reject we reject all of them
[1:08:57] you don't say I'm going to take the left
[1:08:59] ear of God and get rid of the right leg
[1:09:01] no you take all of God you don't take
[1:09:03] any of it amen uh I take the loving kind
[1:09:06] God but I don't want the vengeful
[1:09:09] judgment god well then you don't want
[1:09:10] God right amen you want all of God and
[1:09:14] there's people they have a form of
[1:09:16] godliness that's where we I guess a lot
[1:09:18] of times we get to the word piety Pious
[1:09:22] uh put forth HS uh pretentious
[1:09:26] uh facade they they make it look like
[1:09:29] they're holy they present themselves as
[1:09:31] some something that's holy or Godly they
[1:09:34] have a form of
[1:09:36] godliness uh but they deny the power of
[1:09:38] God yes amen they deny the power of God
[1:09:42] they deny the power thereof yes amen
[1:09:44] that's how the Catholic church was birth
[1:09:47] yes amen all the piety all of the
[1:09:49] Holiness all the sacredness and
[1:09:52] absolutely reject Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] absolutely reject Jesus Christ yes amen
[1:09:58] they'd rather pray pray to a woman or to
[1:10:01] a saint and I don't mean that as a KN
[1:10:03] them they'd rather pray to Mary or give
[1:10:06] alms to her or to a uh or to a dead
[1:10:11] person what they consider Saints well we
[1:10:14] kind of Sol that last week with the
[1:10:16] scripture we read amen they'd rather do
[1:10:19] that well they just deny the power of
[1:10:21] God right amen let's just Satan in
[1:10:25] instituted in there let's just say these
[1:10:27] titles father son Holy Ghost and that'll
[1:10:29] be a substitute that is not a substitute
[1:10:32] amen they just completely reject the
[1:10:35] name of Jesus Christ and do away with it
[1:10:39] amen praise the Lord 1 Timothy I had to
[1:10:43] turn to 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse
[1:10:47] 6 1 Timothy 66 but godliness with
[1:10:51] contentment is great gain amen cont
[1:10:55] contentment there's the there's the rub
[1:10:57] a lot of people have want to follow God
[1:11:01] want godliness in their lives but they
[1:11:04] don't want to do anything difficult they
[1:11:06] don't want to do anything hard they
[1:11:07] don't want to do anything that rubs
[1:11:08] against the flesh they they kind of want
[1:11:10] they just want to do what they want to
[1:11:12] do they just want to live their lives

[1:11:17] but I don't want you to be my lord well
[1:11:19] he's not going to be anything there amen
[1:11:22] he's not even going to be your he's not
[1:11:24] even going to be your savior is not
[1:11:25] going to be your Lord amen and people
[1:11:28] want this but contentment finding
[1:11:30] contentment finding contentment is much
[1:11:33] is as much godliness in the things that
[1:11:35] God gives you now that's not I'm not
[1:11:37] saying
[1:11:38] complacency there's a difference in
[1:11:40] contentment and
[1:11:42] complacency amen contentment is being
[1:11:44] thankful for what God has done for you
[1:11:47] and all that you've done and work uh
[1:11:50] complacent is just you just become a bum
[1:11:53] just lazy don't want to do anything
[1:11:55] right uh you just complacent what you
[1:11:57] got or uh what little bit maybe the Lord
[1:12:00] is even uh giving you say I think I I I
[1:12:04] thank I thank God for what he's done for
[1:12:06] me but God I don't want any more just
[1:12:08] leave me alone
[1:12:09] now amen complacency contentment means
[1:12:13] god I thank you for what you've given me
[1:12:15] amen I appreciate I'm going to keep
[1:12:17] living my life I'm going to keep doing

[1:12:25] Lord in every capacity and and stay
[1:12:29] content with what we have I may not have
[1:12:31] as Peter said silver and gold but I do
[1:12:35] have something and that's him amen what
[1:12:38] I have I can give to others amen even
[1:12:41] more than silver and gold eternal

[1:13:05] content but that but they that will be
[1:13:08] rich fall into temptation and a snare
[1:13:11] and into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:13:14] which drown uh which drown men in
[1:13:17] destruction and predition For the Love

[1:14:49] is those are things that will corrupt a
[1:14:52] person's mind yes amen he he's telling
[1:14:55] them man of God flee these things and
[1:14:58] follow after righteousness and godliness

[1:15:05] the attributes of God the fruit of the
[1:15:07] spirit follow after the things that are
[1:15:09] of godliness not it's so easy to fall
[1:15:12] into that trap too Saints especially in
[1:15:15] this world of Plenty why do you think so
[1:15:16] many people are killing themselves by
[1:15:18] Suicide and drugs and pills all the time
[1:15:21] people have to they're they're the
[1:15:25] majority I will say the majority of
[1:15:27] people in this country cannot live their
[1:15:31] lives unless they are stimulated in some
[1:15:33] way by an artificial
[1:15:35] substance whether it's gambling or
[1:15:39] liquor or cigarettes or drugs or rless
[1:15:43] living something they cannot live unless
[1:15:46] there's some kind of something
[1:15:47] stimulating them amen I I say
[1:15:51] this and and I don't I don't I don't
[1:15:53] think the guys ever watched me but um
[1:15:56] you
[1:15:57] know a lot of times the guy couple of
[1:16:00] the guys especially on the team and the
[1:16:02] guy here in town nice guy good worker I
[1:16:05] like him but man when when
[1:16:10] when he lives for his next
[1:16:13] dream I mean I don't know how to say it
[1:16:15] he lives for his next dream that that's
[1:16:18] that's his so much of the focus that he
[1:16:20] has amen is when and how and where is he
[1:16:25] going to get his next drink and it's
[1:16:27] it's sad he's only 35 I try to tell him
[1:16:31] but never know he's there for a reason
[1:16:34] but but it's not just him a lot of the
[1:16:36] world is that same way yes a lot of
[1:16:39] women business women they can't wait to
[1:16:42] get to the fridge to pull out a bottle
[1:16:44] of wine yeah there's got to be a
[1:16:46] stimulus sometime people can't live
[1:16:48] their lives just just live their life I
[1:16:50] told him the other day I said I have a
[1:16:52] stimulus you guys don't know anything
[1:16:53] about amen I I don't need I don't need
[1:16:56] all this other artificial amen I have a
[1:16:59] real stimulant you guys will have a
[1:17:01] headache from yours I'll have Jubilation
[1:17:03] for mine amen amen praise the Lord
[1:17:06] there's a big difference but it it's it
[1:17:09] it comes to the mindset get rid of those
[1:17:13] the things of the world and and take the
[1:17:15] things of God the godliness the Holiness
[1:17:18] the righteousness the meekness last
[1:17:21] scripture I'm going to read on here now
[1:17:27] amen Ephesians 4 we read this scripture
[1:17:30] as well uh a couple weeks
[1:17:34] ago Ephesians chapter 4 we'll start with
[1:17:38] verse 11 he gave some Apostles some
[1:17:41] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[1:17:43] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:17:46] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:17:48] the edifying of the body of Christ edify
[1:17:52] the body of Christ and that's what it's
[1:17:55] all about edifying to build up edify is
[1:17:58] to build amen not to tear down but to
[1:18:02] build amen edify edify the body of
[1:18:06] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:18:10] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:18:12] Son of God unto a perfect man perfect
[1:18:16] again unto the measure of the stature of
[1:18:20] the fullness of Christ statue of perfect
[1:18:25] man stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:18:27] till we all come into this place that
[1:18:31] fullness of Jesus Christ Christ the word
[1:18:34] Christ uh uh life of God living through
[1:18:39] his people amen godliness to be like God
[1:18:44] to live the life of God Amen brotherly
[1:18:48] kindness I don't know if I have U time
[1:18:50] to finish this
[1:18:53] one amen brotherly
[1:18:56] kindness I think it's striking I always
[1:19:00] I have for
[1:19:01] years found it very very striking that
[1:19:04] on this now we know these attributes and
[1:19:07] uh we it's not like we have uh Faith
[1:19:11] obviously has to be the
[1:19:13] beginning uh without faith you can't
[1:19:15] have you can't have to to the point that
[1:19:18] they are to be uh according to uh the
[1:19:21] quote I I'll I'll read at some point in
[1:19:23] this study that brother bam talks about
[1:19:26] uh operates in in in every one of these
[1:19:30] amen uh I I but I yet found it striking
[1:19:35] that brotherly kindness comes after
[1:19:41] godliness you would think godliness
[1:19:43] would be right there with love because
[1:19:45] God is love right but notice how
[1:19:48] brotherly kindness is tucked in there
[1:19:51] between being like God and love
[1:19:56] charity seems striking to me anyway and
[1:20:00] but what does that tell us what is it
[1:20:03] what it tells me is that brotherly
[1:20:06] kindness is as important to us than we
[1:20:10] consider even our own
[1:20:13] godliness because well brother R even
[1:20:16] said that God would rather me love you
[1:20:18] than love him because when I'm loving
[1:20:20] you I'm loving him amen that's where
[1:20:23] brotherly kindness false into living
[1:20:26] your life for others amen putting yours
[1:20:29] putting your needs behind those of
[1:20:32] others now that does that doesn't mean
[1:20:34] that you go desolate or without or go
[1:20:36] hungry no no no doesn't mean that but it
[1:20:39] means that you do esteem other better
[1:20:41] than yourself brotherly kindness putting
[1:20:44] others uh uh putting yourself in others
[1:20:49] places if you will wearing uh the
[1:20:51] proverbial Man's Shoes or walking in a
[1:20:54] in the man's moccasins or however that
[1:20:56] story goes it it's the it's the
[1:20:59] proverbial putting yourself in their
[1:21:01] place how do they
[1:21:03] feel what would they feel about
[1:21:06] it what reaction would they have now I
[1:21:10] hope and pray I I try God help me I know
[1:21:13] I fall all the time but I try to live my
[1:21:17] life on that
[1:21:18] basis that I try to do to others what I
[1:21:22] believe that I would want done to me
[1:21:24] right I I I try to uh again
[1:21:29] um failing miserably I try to live I
[1:21:34] think we all try to live our lives to
[1:21:37] where uh we live in a place that we
[1:21:40] treat others like we would want to be
[1:21:43] treated we do for others like we would
[1:21:45] want others to do for us amen and and
[1:21:50] not expecting to receive back it's not a
[1:21:54] recip ation uh we're not we're not
[1:21:57] looking for reciprocation here this is
[1:21:59] not a matter of saying well I'm going to
[1:22:01] do this for you and I'm going to expect
[1:22:03] later on that you're going to do this
[1:22:05] for me no no reciprocity is not a part
[1:22:08] of the deal with God or or or or the
[1:22:11] godliness of God not deal but the
[1:22:13] godliness of God reciprocity has nothing
[1:22:15] to do with it we don't give expecting to
[1:22:18] get back no we just give right brotherly
[1:22:22] kindness is doing for others not
[1:22:25] expecting to get back not expecting that
[1:22:28] they're going to do for you now you hope
[1:22:30] maybe if that person uh is in the kind
[1:22:32] of place and lives the kind of life that
[1:22:34] they would but that should not affect
[1:22:37] brotherly kindness at all our brotherly
[1:22:40] kindness and living our lives for others
[1:22:43] uh and having that our ourselves put
[1:22:46] ourselves in their place uh is it should
[1:22:50] just be a part of of
[1:22:52] godliness a part of godliness is
[1:22:54] brotherly kindness living for other
[1:22:57] people be affectionate to other people
[1:23:00] careful of other people's
[1:23:02] feelings uh uh the way we treat one
[1:23:05] another is the way that we would treat
[1:23:08] God Amen the way that we treat one
[1:23:15] another to be able to have brotherly
[1:23:18] kindness is to live the life of
[1:23:21] God for others to see that life in
[1:23:27] you and
[1:23:31] being kind to one another live your life
[1:23:35] for others you're staring heaven in the
[1:23:38] face
[1:23:40] yes let me read
[1:23:43] this Matthew 18
[1:23:47] 2122 I have printed out
[1:23:50] here I'll probably have to pick this
[1:23:53] back up start U again next time but I
[1:23:56] wanted to try to get into this because
[1:23:58] it goes so much with godliness and
[1:24:01] charity
[1:24:02] love uh I could spend a half a dozen
[1:24:05] services on so I won't but uh so it
[1:24:09] probably will be a service unto itself
[1:24:13] uh not to the degree that I've
[1:24:15] ministered on it before but
[1:24:18] um uh but it would probably still take a
[1:24:21] whole service brotherly kindness Matthew
[1:24:23] 18 21 then came Peter to him and said
[1:24:26] Lord how off shall my brother sin
[1:24:29] against me and I forgive him till seven
[1:24:34] times Jesus said unto him I say not unto
[1:24:37] thee until seven times but until 70 time
[1:24:41] 7 70 time anybody know what 70 time 7
[1:24:46] is it's
[1:24:49] 490 but anybody know the greater Point
[1:24:53] outside the math
[1:24:56] amen because this is a daily
[1:24:59] occurrence amen if I forgive one and
[1:25:04] that doesn't mean that that's not an
[1:25:07] overall 490 for every human I encounter
[1:25:10] that day that's 490 per day per
[1:25:16] person so God is God is not telling
[1:25:20] Peter
[1:25:22] Peter this person's not a good
[1:25:26] person and when they get to
[1:25:29] 489 at the 490th time in that day that
[1:25:33] they offend you you have every right to
[1:25:35] come against them
[1:25:38] then that's not what he's saying right
[1:25:41] 490 is a large number never be reached
[1:25:45] right what he's telling us is it's
[1:25:49] Limitless what he's saying is when this
[1:25:53] brother when this person transgress
[1:25:56] against you forgiven period no questions
[1:26:00] asked now I think Peter probably thought
[1:26:03] man I'm GNA sound like a really good guy
[1:26:05] here I'm gonna go for a high number
[1:26:07] seven times a day Lord this one person
[1:26:10] seven times in a day he thought he was I
[1:26:13] Pro I think he probably thought he was
[1:26:14] going for this great number he's going
[1:26:16] to look he's going to look great in
[1:26:18] front of Jesus he's going to be he's
[1:26:20] going to be the topnotch number one
[1:26:22] disciple cuz remember he he was still a
[1:26:25] very prideful man at this point did not
[1:26:27] have the Holy Ghost he probably thought
[1:26:30] oh I'm going to I'm going to Jesus
[1:26:32] really gonna seven times I'm going to
[1:26:34] forgive my brother Jesus looked at him
[1:26:36] and said nope 70 times seven in other
[1:26:39] words Peter it's Limitless right you
[1:26:42] don't put a limit on how many times you
[1:26:44] forgive a brother how many times you
[1:26:46] forgive a sister you don't put a limit
[1:26:49] on on forgiveness you
[1:26:51] forgive amen forgive
[1:26:55] let God it again we can go back to uh to
[1:27:00] some of the other virtues but Vengeance
[1:27:04] belongs to God not us we are to forgive
[1:27:08] I forgive I forgive you amen it does now
[1:27:13] I I might have forgave you for running
[1:27:15] over me one time but that doesn't mean
[1:27:17] I'm gonna stick my head under your wheel
[1:27:20] again amen I'm not going to lay down in
[1:27:23] front of your car again you've already
[1:27:24] proved you're going to run over me so
[1:27:26] I'm not going to lay down in front of
[1:27:27] you again but I forgive you for doing it
[1:27:29] right amen amen you
[1:27:32] understand it's not saying I'm I'm GNA
[1:27:34] put myself in that situation again
[1:27:39] uh but I will forgive yes I will forgive
[1:27:43] you amen and and not just lip
[1:27:46] service um it's uh it's so easy and my
[1:27:51] mind is going so many ways now good uh
[1:27:55] and all through my
[1:27:57] book right
[1:28:01] but
[1:28:03] forgive amen forgiveness brotherly
[1:28:06] kindness brings us to forgiveness and
[1:28:09] that's what Jesus is telling Peter
[1:28:12] forgive
[1:28:14] amen you don't become their doormat but
[1:28:16] you forgive them
[1:28:18] right if you don't forgive them if you
[1:28:22] don't really truly forgive them
[1:28:25] that seed is going to stay in there yes
[1:28:27] amen that seed is going to stay in there
[1:28:29] and it's going to start growing because
[1:28:31] the seed the seed will will grow to its
[1:28:35] to its manifestation again amen it will
[1:28:38] grow it's got to be completely
[1:28:40] eradicated dug out cut down stumped
[1:28:44] grubbed up and everything amen every bit
[1:28:47] of Speck of Life of that has got to be
[1:28:49] done away with
[1:28:51] annihilated amen for forgiv foress to
[1:28:54] truly take hold to truly take hold
[1:28:59] now are we supposed to wait for someone
[1:29:03] to ask for
[1:29:05] forgiveness or do we just
[1:29:07] forgive asking is nice but does that
[1:29:10] always happen actually probably more
[1:29:13] seldom than really is one of the few
[1:29:16] things that a lot of people don't even
[1:29:18] want to
[1:29:19] say I'm wrong most people don't don't
[1:29:22] even want to utter those two words words
[1:29:24] I'm wrong actually that's a conjunction
[1:29:27] three words really I am wrong and uh
[1:29:30] forgive
[1:29:32] me sometimes they go together forgive me
[1:29:35] I was wrong but a lot of people don't
[1:29:38] want to say those words they just too
[1:29:39] much pride right they don't want to say
[1:29:41] it they won't say it and sometimes
[1:29:43] people may have hurt you and you didn't
[1:29:44] even know it or they didn't know it they
[1:29:48] didn't know they hurt
[1:29:50] you that happens yeah but you forgive
[1:29:54] right amen forgive make it right whole
[1:29:58] another subject but a part of Brotherly
[1:30:02] kindness is looking at one another as
[1:30:05] our own selves amen amen I read that
[1:30:09] scripture as I
[1:30:10] close um where David
[1:30:15] said though they do I'm paraphrasing of
[1:30:18] course I didn't I didn't U Save it but
[1:30:24] though they do evil against me I will do
[1:30:27] good to them I will pray for them as
[1:30:30] though they were my own mother right
[1:30:34] amen that's pretty heavy considering at
[1:30:37] least most people uh how they would pray
[1:30:40] for their own mother amen that gave them
[1:30:43] life that that brought them into the
[1:30:45] world Amen that was his admission I'll
[1:30:48] pray for that person that hurt me and
[1:30:50] despitefully used me in a way that I
[1:30:53] pray for my own mother amen praise the
[1:30:57] Lord brotherly
[1:30:59] kindness the part of godliness that will
[1:31:01] bring us to that point Lord willing I'll
[1:31:04] try to finish the rest of this next week
[1:31:06] but now let's let's go ahead and stand
[1:31:07] to our feet if we
[1:31:12] could amen because it's so easy maybe
[1:31:15] that anointing is there I don't know
[1:31:18] I've I've held off
[1:31:19] on
[1:31:22] uh min ministering on bitterness again
[1:31:25] or that but I don't know maybe it's at
[1:31:28] that point here we'll see the Lord knows

[1:31:34] along with whatever this perfect will is
