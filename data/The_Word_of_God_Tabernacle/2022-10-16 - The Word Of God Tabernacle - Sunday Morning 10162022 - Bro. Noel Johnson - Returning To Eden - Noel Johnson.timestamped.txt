[42:42] I want a great wall in the name of the
[42:44] Lord Jesus Christ
[42:46] again it's my privileges to be with you
[42:48] this morning amen
[42:50] you take your Bibles open them to
[42:52] Genesis the second chapter read just two
[42:55] verses there
[42:57] you know we believe we're at the end
[42:58] time it's not coming it's actually here
[43:01] yes there's something that God is trying
[43:04] to do in our lives to prepare us for
[43:07] that we're just coming
[43:08] and so the sermon like a pilot returning
[43:12] back to Eden and hopefully that'll make
[43:15] more sense when we get into it
[43:17] Genesis the second chapter starting in
[43:19] verse 16.
[43:21] and the Lord God commanded the man
[43:23] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[43:25] mayest freely eat
[43:27] the tree of the knowledge of Good and
[43:28] Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for the
[43:31] day thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[43:33] surely die yes and let's just pray
[43:37] our most gracious and loving Heavenly
[43:39] Father it is again our privilege
[43:42] to gather ourselves together around your
[43:43] word and to sit at your feet and receive
[43:46] what you have for us yes Jesus yes for
[43:49] things you've impressed upon me Lord and
[43:51] things you've been showing me in the
[43:52] word yes Lord and Lord with your
[43:55] assistance with your with your
[43:57] permission Lord I would like for you to
[43:59] express to the people that which you've
[44:02] been showing me yes yes or Lord I
[44:04] believe it'll help us all on the hour in
[44:06] which we're living yes to be able to
[44:07] realize there's coming a day when it's
[44:09] days soon
[44:11] our bodies will be changed and all of a
[44:13] sudden we'll hear the marriage supper
[44:14] amen and then after that Lord we're
[44:16] going to come back and Rule and reign
[44:18] with you
[44:21] you'll be with me this morning take
[44:24] control of this vessel and use it for
[44:26] your honor and your glory by asking
[44:28] Jesus Christ's name
[44:30] amen amen you seated
[44:34] you know it's interesting that when God
[44:36] began to give a commandment to
[44:39] to Adam and Eve
[44:41] he said in a tree of the knobs are good
[44:43] and evil thou shall not eat it for the
[44:45] day thou eat us thereof Thou shalt
[44:47] surely die
[44:48] when God had taken Adam and Eve and
[44:50] placed him in the garden
[44:53] they had I mean the Fellowship they had
[44:55] was unhindered Adam could look into the
[44:58] Realms above him he could see the angels
[45:00] He could see God he could see the throne
[45:01] he could see everything there was to see
[45:03] that Dimension was not that Dimension
[45:07] was open unto him
[45:09] because Satan is the prince of the power
[45:10] of the air He has blocked that that's
[45:13] why we can't see right but I noticed
[45:15] listening to what brother Branham has
[45:17] often says he says you know there's
[45:19] angels all around us yes he sees up he
[45:23] can see that right when he prayed for
[45:25] somebody he said oh he's he's
[45:27] into God deserving he says you you you
[45:30] have this oh and you
[45:32] you have the same thing they have
[45:35] they're crying out for help yes I
[45:38] reviewed both of you in the name of
[45:39] Jesus Christ and they would go amen so
[45:41] he could see into a realm that for the
[45:43] most for most of us we we just don't
[45:45] enter into that realm but yet that realm
[45:48] still affects us yes that realm really
[45:51] it's guiding it's controlling what is
[45:53] going on in the world Satan's Eden he
[45:56] controls it all
[45:58] um okay but we're not part of Satan's
[46:01] Eden right amen we are different we are
[46:04] God's children and it's God is trying to
[46:07] take his children and he's trying to
[46:09] make us aware of just who we are trying
[46:12] to make us aware that we're not part of
[46:14] this world we're not part of Satan's
[46:16] Aiden no we are Sons and Daughters of
[46:18] God that have been fully restored to our
[46:20] rightful position with our father amen
[46:22] amen the more we can begin to recognize
[46:25] that and recognize brother Madam in one
[46:28] place it says when the bride realizes
[46:29] who she is and what she possesses she'll
[46:32] do the Greater Works when we begin to
[46:34] understand that we are Sons and
[46:36] Daughters of God
[46:37] we are the purchase of the blood of
[46:39] Jesus Christ amen and Jesus Christ blood
[46:42] was God's blood so we are the purchase
[46:44] of God's own blood and so he we are we
[46:47] are God we are God's possession we are
[46:50] God's children and Satan has no rights
[46:52] to us amen we are no longer part of this
[46:55] world right we are a different creation
[46:57] of which Satan should have no part but
[47:00] we have to withstand him
[47:02] you know brother random when he hit when
[47:04] he was growing up he was a prize fighter
[47:06] right a price fighter when they get in
[47:08] the ring he says now you hit me real
[47:10] gentle and and I want her to hit you
[47:12] very hard either we'll get through this
[47:14] no they're looking for The Knockout puns
[47:17] they're looking for one way to lay that
[47:18] guy out flat right well when Satan gets
[47:21] six of his ugly head hit him in the head
[47:24] given everything you got yeah lay him
[47:26] out flat let him know I am not going to
[47:28] tolerate you you don't have any
[47:30] possession with me you have no part with
[47:32] me make your bags pack them get out of
[47:34] here amen because that is our rights yes
[47:38] that is our right as a son and daughter
[47:41] of God yes sir and what is God God is
[47:45] not just some wimpy little thing oh I
[47:46] wonder if they're going to survive today
[47:48] I wonder if they're gonna when I want
[47:50] all these poor people I wonder if
[47:51] they're going to be able to make it
[47:52] through tomorrow
[47:54] no
[47:55] my God's an awesome God Amen I mean
[47:58] there's nothing he can't do by a spoken
[48:00] word the universe came into
[48:01] manifestation yes sir everything is
[48:03] subject to him that's Satan and all of
[48:05] us demons
[48:07] we
[48:09] can access our father and we can tell
[48:12] our father this guy is bothering me yes
[48:15] just you know I only need 10 000 Angels
[48:17] come on just just clean them off you
[48:19] know
[48:20] but we have access to everything Heaven
[48:22] is yeah amen but we have to be willing
[48:25] to access it yes
[48:27] in Christ the ministry of God revealed
[48:29] brother Brown says it's a revelation
[48:31] it says Eternal as God's word is eternal
[48:33] look but but the threefold purpose of
[48:36] God's great mystery is revealed God
[48:38] manifested in Christ Christ manifested
[48:41] in the church in order to re to redeem
[48:44] and restore Eve
[48:46] the original condition in the Garden of
[48:48] Eden right so what is the whole purpose
[48:52] of Salvation what is the whole purpose
[48:54] of the Plan of Redemption to get us back
[48:56] to Eden Amen to get us back to that
[48:59] relationship
[49:01] to get us back to the position where
[49:02] really we there is no sin to our church
[49:04] we'll be in glorified bodies yes yes you
[49:07] know when we think about the body that
[49:09] you see is not me
[49:11] amen there's a theophany
[49:13] that was a part of God from the
[49:15] beginning yes that's who I am the only
[49:18] problem I have is that's the offering
[49:20] still trying to take this flesh and and
[49:22] tell it no this is not you no you're
[49:25] something higher than what you precede
[49:26] and so what you need to do is get in
[49:29] touch with your theophany so to speak
[49:30] and be able to enter into a realm in
[49:33] which it lives and be able to have the
[49:35] faith in God because God is through that
[49:38] theophany is working on officer or
[49:40] something
[49:40] in that nature but we have to begin to
[49:43] believe who we are amen
[49:46] and until you can accept the fact that
[49:48] you're a son and daughter of God
[49:50] I mean really accept the fact that you
[49:52] are a manifestation of God himself yes
[49:55] until you can accept that fact Satan
[49:57] Satan will win amen but it but when you
[50:00] begin to accept that fact and then Satan
[50:02] sticks up his ugly head as they Satan I
[50:05] suggest you leave right now otherwise
[50:06] you're going to get bloodied because I'm
[50:08] going to beat you to a pole yes
[50:11] and how do we beat him we do it with the
[50:13] word right when Satan attempted Jesus
[50:16] Christ what did he do Satan says oh it's
[50:18] written and Jesus says yeah but it's
[50:19] also written amen he always took him
[50:22] back to the word because brother Brown
[50:23] says the word of God will defeat Satan
[50:25] any time anywhere under any circumstance
[50:27] yes but you have to believe that word
[50:30] and you have to believe that God will
[50:32] honor that word amen you have to have
[50:34] faith in God faith is not believing for
[50:37] something faith is believing in someone
[50:40] amen do you believe in someone and you
[50:42] believe that someone has the ability to
[50:44] heal you believe that someone has the
[50:46] ability to create you believe that that
[50:48] being you can do anything and everything
[50:50] and if you have that kind of faith in
[50:52] that being then all you do is go to him
[50:54] and says father because he is our father
[50:56] father I have a need today amen and just
[50:59] laid out before him amen and then it's
[51:01] not begging
[51:03] no we are not Beggars right I am God's
[51:07] son amen I do not have to beg for what
[51:10] he's already trying to give me yes it's
[51:12] like when when uh we're at youth camps
[51:16] that I was at a few years back
[51:19] um God showed me something
[51:22] all right because we'd have
[51:24] the minister would get up there he
[51:26] prayed something you know make an altar
[51:28] call him yeah you know everybody come
[51:30] forward we'd pray for this one pray for
[51:31] that one
[51:33] then the next Sun the next evening what
[51:35] we'd have another service
[51:37] and they always went ahead everybody
[51:40] that came back the first night was there
[51:42] a second time
[51:44] so he prayed for them
[51:46] third night was the same
[51:48] I said Lord I don't understand what's
[51:50] going on here
[51:52] and so some thoughts came in my mind and
[51:54] he says you know it's like a woman she's
[51:56] out there and she's going through the
[51:58] village and she's begging for this and
[52:00] she's all dirty and her hair's all
[52:02] messed up and she's she hasn't eaten her
[52:04] decent meal in weeks and she's going can
[52:06] I just have a little piece of bread
[52:08] please use a little piece of bread I'm
[52:09] just so I would do just a little barcel
[52:11] of bread just so I can survive
[52:13] and should we go to this one and this
[52:15] one and this one
[52:16] and finally she says you know there's a
[52:18] good man on the hill
[52:20] oh I'm sure he'll I'm sure he'll be
[52:22] he'll be kind to me I'm sure he'll go
[52:24] ahead and he'll give me just just a
[52:26] little more celebration I'm so hungry
[52:28] so she goes up when she knocks on the
[52:30] door
[52:31] the gentleman of the house opens the
[52:33] door
[52:35] looks at her and she begins to beg
[52:38] he looks at her and says sweetheart
[52:41] what are you out here begging for
[52:44] you're my wife
[52:46] oh look at your hair's all messed up and
[52:49] your clothes are so dirty yeah because
[52:50] we have you caught with the the you know
[52:53] the there's a shower there's a bath you
[52:55] know washing by the water of the word
[52:57] amen and we have we've had we've had
[53:00] this the banquet spread out for you yes
[53:03] just waiting for you to come home amen
[53:05] just go down after you've got yourself
[53:07] clean why don't you go in the banquet
[53:09] room and just feed yourself
[53:11] you don't have to beg right
[53:13] you are his wife amen
[53:16] yes how many men have your wife been
[53:20] crawling our hands and knees and you
[53:22] know hobby would you give me just a
[53:24] little bit of something and I haven't
[53:25] eaten for two days now I just would like
[53:27] a little bit of something that's in the
[53:29] fridge
[53:30] now yeah right I mean she's basically
[53:33] the one who goes in the fridge and
[53:34] serves you you know but I mean but but
[53:36] here again this is the point amen it's
[53:38] not a matter of begging right it's a
[53:41] matter of accepting what he's already
[53:42] given to you yes and you can go and you
[53:45] can eat freely amen why did God why do
[53:47] we have the message on tape or on CD or
[53:50] whatever we media you to use now yeah
[53:53] that is God trying to feed the bride and
[53:55] let this is who you are amen you are not
[53:58] someone with you little person no you
[53:59] are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are
[54:01] his you are his wife you are the one he
[54:03] loved from the beginning of creation
[54:05] Hallelujah and he wants to feed you he
[54:07] wants to encourage him he wants you to
[54:09] overcome the things of this world
[54:10] because only by over and you can only
[54:13] overcome through him yes amen you're not
[54:15] going to do it in yourself amen no you
[54:17] have to rely upon him like Jesus himself
[54:20] you know Satan says you're hungry you
[54:23] haven't eaten for 40 days take this
[54:25] sounds make him into bread
[54:27] Jesus so you don't live by bread alone
[54:29] amen by every word of God Amen if God
[54:32] had told him to sure he could have sure
[54:34] you know I mean here again what do you
[54:37] do you go back to the word because only
[54:39] through the word can you defeat Satan
[54:41] amen
[54:42] we say oh we believe God heals
[54:44] and he does
[54:46] but until you make that personal to
[54:48] yourself
[54:49] no God your word says you have healed me
[54:51] and once you read once once you make
[54:54] that promise
[54:55] um to where God is promising you then
[54:58] all of a sudden now there's an
[54:59] obligation yeah
[55:01] but then once you want to remind him of
[55:04] his obligation then you thank him yes as
[55:07] I hear again going back to the Youth
[55:09] Camp there was a young lady and she was
[55:11] crying and crying and crying and in
[55:14] front of the minister just went over to
[55:15] her sister what are you wanting oh I won
[55:18] I freaking don't know what it was
[55:20] he said sister start thanking him yes
[55:23] don't beg start thanking him amen amen
[55:26] so she started thanking God for what she
[55:29] was seeking for and a few minutes later
[55:31] all of a sudden she just had her hands
[55:32] raised up and she was running the aisles
[55:34] because now God was wanting to give it
[55:36] to her but she was not willing to accept
[55:39] it right but once you're willing to
[55:41] accept that all of us are okay that
[55:43] changes the whole picture amen
[55:45] yes
[55:48] we know that God in the beginning it
[55:50] says the Bible says in the beginning God
[55:52] created the heavens and the Earth that's
[55:54] in Genesis 1 1 right but you go into
[55:57] John the first chapter now and we begin
[55:59] to find out in what form God was in when
[56:01] he began the process of creation
[56:04] so in the beginning was the word the
[56:06] word was with God and the Word was God
[56:07] the same was in the beginning with God
[56:10] and all things were made by him and
[56:11] without him was done anything made that
[56:13] was made and in him was life and the
[56:15] life was the light of men amen so God is
[56:18] a spirit nobody can see a spirit we can
[56:21] feel a spirit we can we can sense his
[56:23] presence but yet just to see it to see a
[56:27] spirit as a physical being is not an
[56:28] option because they don't have physical
[56:31] manifestations if you will right so God
[56:34] had to create himself in a physical form
[56:37] where he can sit there and he could
[56:39] create a universe where God can come and
[56:42] he could express himself to his family
[56:45] because then God was a family yes and he
[56:47] wanted to have anyone to fellowship with
[56:49] his family amen but he can't fellowship
[56:51] with him in spirit no they had they had
[56:53] to take on bodies that's why it says in
[56:56] the beginning God had the logos in the
[56:58] beginning was the thought of in God's
[56:59] mind and this thought was with God in
[57:02] the beginning
[57:03] and this and this thought finally came
[57:05] into manifestation in a theophany form
[57:07] amen
[57:09] but so you have to realize we were in
[57:11] that theophany when that's the often it
[57:13] was formed yes amen all of God's
[57:16] children was in that theophany when
[57:17] that's the often it came into
[57:18] manifestation right and then from that
[57:21] point on God was wanting to take and
[57:23] have that which was in that's the often
[57:26] he wanted to come into manifestation so
[57:28] God could fellowship with his children
[57:30] yes praise the Lord because he could not
[57:32] fellowship with Amen in any other form
[57:34] yeah well this is what we are we are an
[57:38] expression of God we are a manifestation
[57:40] of a thought of God from the beginning
[57:42] yeah
[57:43] in numerous in numerous places
[57:47] because it goes on in Genesis
[57:49] in in Genesis 1 26 and God said let us
[57:52] make man in our image after our likeness
[57:55] and let them have dominion over the fish
[57:57] of the sea the fowl of the air and the
[57:58] cattle and over everything the creepers
[58:00] upon the Earth amen so God created a man
[58:02] in his own image in the image of God
[58:04] created he him male and female created
[58:07] he them
[58:08] so when Adam was first formed that's the
[58:10] officer with that within that theophany
[58:12] there was him and his wife amen okay and
[58:16] God blessed them but they were in
[58:17] theophany form at that point
[58:21] and goes on in Genesis 2 and God formed
[58:24] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[58:26] of the ground and breathed into his
[58:27] nostrils a breath of life and Man became
[58:29] a living Soul yes
[58:31] so that's the oxanae which is our soul
[58:34] now all of a sudden Gammon dwelt in the
[58:36] human flesh amen and in that human flesh
[58:39] God had to put him in human flesh
[58:40] because he was supposed to he was
[58:43] supposed to rule the Earth
[58:45] but he could not he could not experience
[58:47] what the animals were experiencing
[58:49] until he was made flesh right amen God
[58:53] could not experience Humanity until he
[58:55] experienced it in Jesus Christ amen
[58:58] that's why he had to come in human flesh
[59:00] that's why he had to become our Kinsmen
[59:02] Redeemer he didn't have to experience
[59:04] everything we experienced
[59:06] from it being a baby being a totally
[59:09] helpless individual yes where his mother
[59:11] had to feed him mother had to clothe the
[59:13] mother had to bathe him mother had to
[59:15] correct him mother had to teach them how
[59:17] to walk mother had to teach them how to
[59:19] talk mother had to teach them all of
[59:20] these different things yes
[59:22] he but he was God Amen when he came into
[59:26] manifestation he was God yes but he had
[59:29] to experience everything we experienced
[59:32] right amen the Bible says he and he was
[59:36] tempted in all the ways that we are
[59:38] tempted yes but he never sinned right he
[59:41] never doubted God Amen because brother
[59:43] Brown says sin is unbelievable right so
[59:46] he always in in that when he actually
[59:49] knew what the purpose for his coming
[59:51] into manifestation when did he do he
[59:53] know that we don't know
[59:55] but as a child he had to grow up and he
[59:57] had to learn different things but see
[59:59] there was a nature in him
[1:00:02] that was a manifestation of his father
[1:00:04] yes I am I am an expression of my death
[1:00:07] amen because because a lot of the a lot
[1:00:10] of my Expressions the same as my dad had
[1:00:13] because I came from him right okay and
[1:00:17] each of you you there are certain traits
[1:00:19] that you have there are certain things
[1:00:20] that you do and say oh yeah you know
[1:00:22] your mama just your mom acted just the
[1:00:25] same way your mama smiled just the same
[1:00:27] way you smile or your dad had this this
[1:00:29] kind of a
[1:00:30] a mannerism or something and you know
[1:00:33] it's just like your daddy did right
[1:00:35] because that's part of you
[1:00:38] so in Jesus Christ when he was when he
[1:00:40] was formed when he came even as a baby
[1:00:42] the only nature that dwelt in him was
[1:00:45] that of God Amen and so all of the
[1:00:48] attributes of God oh God he what he what
[1:00:51] did he Express the only thing he could
[1:00:53] express as a child was that of the
[1:00:55] nature of the god that dwelt in him amen
[1:00:58] and so he never doubted his father he
[1:01:01] never doubted God right he never sinned
[1:01:04] but everybody hit here again but yeah
[1:01:06] did Mommy have to correct him sure
[1:01:09] because he had to learn to conform to
[1:01:10] the society as Society was in his day
[1:01:14] sure we have to we have to conform to
[1:01:16] society our society as it is in these
[1:01:19] days
[1:01:20] amen we can't get on the freeway and do
[1:01:22] 90 miles an hour there's a law against
[1:01:24] that because I think there still is here
[1:01:26] yeah
[1:01:27] um but you know I mean there are certain
[1:01:28] there's certain restrictions that we do
[1:01:30] have and so we conform to our the laws
[1:01:33] of the land simply because we don't want
[1:01:35] we don't want to offend if you will
[1:01:40] but you know it's interesting when God
[1:01:42] had taken Adam and Eve
[1:01:45] place them in the garden there's only
[1:01:46] one stipulation God had given to Adam
[1:01:50] don't go to knowledge
[1:01:53] don't rely on knowledge right amen rely
[1:01:56] upon me I am your father I will guide
[1:01:59] you I will direct you I reveal things
[1:02:01] unto you don't go to knowledge because
[1:02:03] knowledge reasons yes Faith merely
[1:02:06] accepts amen and this is what we're
[1:02:09] going back to
[1:02:10] we're going back to a condition where
[1:02:12] really we don't look at knowledge we
[1:02:14] don't look at how we feel we don't look
[1:02:16] at how the things going on around it no
[1:02:18] we sit there and we enter into a realm
[1:02:20] with God in which faith in which Faith
[1:02:23] controls are all our every action amen
[1:02:25] and so like I said do I do I yeah there
[1:02:28] are days I don't feel good
[1:02:30] so
[1:02:31] God's healed me all right so why should
[1:02:34] I accept it amen you know brother Brown
[1:02:36] says you know every man has faith
[1:02:39] yeah you give it to
[1:02:41] you can take you can take your faith and
[1:02:44] give it to Satan except what Satan's
[1:02:46] trying to give you
[1:02:47] or you can take that same faith and give
[1:02:49] it to God and rely upon God's promise
[1:02:52] amen so which one every whoever you give
[1:02:54] it to that's what you can expect
[1:02:57] I mean Satan doesn't give up easy not
[1:02:59] you don't feel good fine I mean there
[1:03:02] are days I haven't felt good so what do
[1:03:03] I do my body tells me if you really want
[1:03:06] to overcome go to bed get some rest
[1:03:08] drink plenty of fluids okay and the
[1:03:11] following day or two you'll be fine
[1:03:13] because the body is telling you I have
[1:03:16] to have time to heal yeah right I have
[1:03:18] to have time to repair myself amen so if
[1:03:21] I give it a chance to do that it'll do
[1:03:23] that yes if I ignore that when my body
[1:03:26] is trying to tell me then okay it'll
[1:03:30] whenever you're sick and you think oh
[1:03:32] now I'm feeling great today
[1:03:34] and you go out and you ignore that
[1:03:37] yeah then the relapse is generally worse
[1:03:39] than the original amen So Yesterday may
[1:03:41] take two days to overcome now you now
[1:03:43] it's a week okay because the body God
[1:03:46] has made it to heal itself right yes you
[1:03:49] have to give it a chance so I I'm not
[1:03:51] negating that but still God has already
[1:03:53] healed me amen and God has already
[1:03:55] healed me then I should be able to enjoy
[1:03:57] that I should be able to I should be
[1:03:59] able to allow my body to repair itself
[1:04:01] because it will yes if I if if I would
[1:04:04] give it the chance amen brother Brandon
[1:04:07] questions and answers he says
[1:04:09] and he walked through the Garden of Eden
[1:04:11] first as a theophany like the holy
[1:04:13] spirit is here now walking here now
[1:04:16] it led animal life it controlled
[1:04:18] everything but it couldn't kill the soil
[1:04:20] sorry see so God put him in flesh so
[1:04:23] that he could till the soil and gave him
[1:04:25] his five senses to chill the soil and to
[1:04:27] fix up The Vineyards and so forth and
[1:04:30] then the man and and then the man still
[1:04:33] looked Lonesome oh this is he said
[1:04:35] brother this is a beautiful picture look
[1:04:38] for when he for for when he was first
[1:04:40] made he was made two people together
[1:04:43] he was made both male and female the man
[1:04:46] was the Bible said that right God made
[1:04:49] God made man both male and female
[1:04:52] created he he him see now when the man
[1:04:55] was separated from the theophany and put
[1:04:57] in flesh he wasn't just all together
[1:05:00] there part of his being was still in
[1:05:02] theophany
[1:05:03] see
[1:05:05] um but about Adam see he see there was
[1:05:07] something lacking and that very crave
[1:05:10] showed that there was a mate waiting for
[1:05:11] him you get that in the very thoughts
[1:05:14] that we have here the very thoughts that
[1:05:16] we have to die here that were troubled
[1:05:19] and perplexed we longed for a life that
[1:05:22] has no death
[1:05:23] but the thing that struck me there he
[1:05:25] says he says
[1:05:27] Adam when he was created he was male and
[1:05:29] female right often he formed amen and
[1:05:32] then God took that the offering Place
[1:05:34] Adam the Adam part of that in a temple
[1:05:36] of clay but he said there was something
[1:05:38] missing because there was a part of Adam
[1:05:41] still in theophany for yes
[1:05:43] well when God created that theophany
[1:05:45] within that theophany was male and
[1:05:47] female
[1:05:48] and so what until Jesus Christ has his
[1:05:51] bride he's not complete either amen we
[1:05:54] are the other half of him amen and when
[1:05:57] you start looking at the godhead when
[1:05:58] brother Ram says oh that God was the
[1:06:00] important to Christ in Christ he pour in
[1:06:01] the church he said don't see the Oneness
[1:06:03] of the godhead amen don't you realize
[1:06:05] you are a part of Jesus Christ from the
[1:06:07] very beginning yes if you are part of
[1:06:09] Jesus Christ from the very beginning
[1:06:10] that elevates you to the place where
[1:06:12] you're part of God praise the Lord amen
[1:06:14] I haven't been able to fully comprehend
[1:06:17] that
[1:06:18] to realize that I am that that I am an
[1:06:21] ex I am an expression of God that is
[1:06:24] true but to take the next step up above
[1:06:27] that and say yeah I
[1:06:30] all that God is I you know I can express
[1:06:34] I mean I cannot die for somebody's sins
[1:06:36] that I mean obviously there are
[1:06:38] limitations that I have in my flesh but
[1:06:40] where we're going back to an Eden there
[1:06:43] will be no hindrance anymore it would be
[1:06:45] like Adam was in the garden Adam was a
[1:06:48] Son of God and as a Son of God he
[1:06:50] controlled nature yes
[1:06:52] Jesus Christ when he was on this he was
[1:06:54] on on the Sea of Galilee
[1:06:56] he was heated he was tired he wouldn't
[1:06:59] lay down the boat his body needed rest
[1:07:01] because it was physical yeah and all of
[1:07:04] a sudden the disciples came and woke him
[1:07:06] up don't you carry the repairs don't you
[1:07:08] see the storm around us they're both
[1:07:09] showing up with light and we're all
[1:07:11] gonna die
[1:07:12] he just look around says peace amen be
[1:07:15] still yeah he didn't scream and shout
[1:07:18] stand up and phone with him out amen he
[1:07:20] didn't have to he knew who he was yes
[1:07:23] amen be still
[1:07:26] brother Brandon when all of a sudden God
[1:07:27] still go back up through the mountain
[1:07:29] Brothers obviously God's going to take
[1:07:31] me home because nobody can survive this
[1:07:33] blizzard that's going on you know I
[1:07:35] guess in Colorado where it was yeah and
[1:07:38] uh and God spoke to him and speak to the
[1:07:40] storm
[1:07:42] whatever you say that's exactly what
[1:07:45] it'll be yes sir
[1:07:47] well
[1:07:48] so he he didn't jump up and down and
[1:07:50] scream and shout he said no
[1:07:53] he says dorm cease
[1:07:55] son you come out and Shine for the next
[1:07:57] however many days it was yeah until we
[1:07:59] finished our hunting triple and then you
[1:08:01] can come back and you can have your
[1:08:02] snowstorm again
[1:08:04] but as soon as the words went out of his
[1:08:07] mouth
[1:08:08] the storm stopped amen and the sun came
[1:08:11] out right
[1:08:13] why could he do that
[1:08:15] God gave him the permission to say I
[1:08:18] mean that's when we get down to the
[1:08:20] spoken word brother Ramsey because
[1:08:21] brother somebody asked brother Brown
[1:08:22] does everybody have the have the spoken
[1:08:24] word can everybody speaks the word
[1:08:27] brother and said well yeah it relies in
[1:08:29] everybody
[1:08:30] but he says whenever the spoken word
[1:08:32] expressed itself through me he says it
[1:08:33] was an unction from God yes right God
[1:08:37] instructed God gave permission amen
[1:08:40] well when when we come to the place in
[1:08:42] our relationship with God where God can
[1:08:45] speak to us and give us the words to say
[1:08:47] yeah yes yeah then it'll happen amen
[1:08:50] because it's no longer us speaking but
[1:08:51] it's God speaking through US yes right
[1:08:53] right I don't know if I related about
[1:08:55] the timing we were in in Israel and in
[1:08:58] India and this lady she um
[1:09:01] anyway this guy told her to fast for 40
[1:09:04] days and 49th I relate that here okay
[1:09:06] but so what happened was all of a sudden
[1:09:08] looking at the situation and all of a
[1:09:11] sudden Works came into my mind
[1:09:14] look don't don't look at the stupidity
[1:09:16] of the ACT but look at that sincerity of
[1:09:18] a pardon yeah
[1:09:21] that may not be the spoken word but
[1:09:24] I don't see why I couldn't
[1:09:27] look at it that way certainly I mean it
[1:09:30] wasn't me I mean I was I was a mess amen
[1:09:33] but here again God needed an instrument
[1:09:35] to speak his word and he just used me
[1:09:38] for that yes right amen amen
[1:09:48] questions and answers in Hebrews brother
[1:09:50] Branham says and Adam was lonesome and
[1:09:53] God should show that that they could not
[1:09:55] be separated
[1:09:57] now I'm going to get back to the same
[1:09:59] thing just a second says look he never
[1:10:01] went and got dirt and made a Eve but he
[1:10:04] made from the original dirt amen Adam
[1:10:06] yes and he took a rib from his side and
[1:10:09] made him a helpmate and that was Eve she
[1:10:12] was made for the man and part of the man
[1:10:14] she was a part of him in the beginning
[1:10:16] in the creation and the theophany she
[1:10:19] was a part of him down here in this
[1:10:21] creation she could not be divided into
[1:10:24] another creation she had to be made in
[1:10:27] the same creation amen amen but see that
[1:10:31] applies to us
[1:10:34] if
[1:10:35] we are part of Jesus Christ
[1:10:38] so what did God do he took a part of
[1:10:40] that that's theophany which was God yes
[1:10:43] and then that's theophany we existed
[1:10:47] and so he took that part of the
[1:10:48] theophany which was himself
[1:10:50] and he took that part of that the
[1:10:52] offering he placed it in human flesh
[1:10:54] that's why we have the seed of God in us
[1:10:57] amen it's not theophany that was a part
[1:11:00] of God from the beginning and that
[1:11:01] theophany is the real us brother Brown
[1:11:03] talks about that in in different ways
[1:11:05] but that's the offering is the real us
[1:11:07] and what God is trying to do he's trying
[1:11:09] to take that theophany which was a part
[1:11:11] of him from the beginning and he's
[1:11:12] trying to sit there and make us realize
[1:11:14] who we are and begin to step into the
[1:11:16] position step into the realm that God
[1:11:18] has called us to live in
[1:11:20] brother Branham lived in that realm he
[1:11:23] didn't he didn't do the the day he was
[1:11:25] born he didn't do it as a as a Baptist
[1:11:28] Tracer come in God gave him visions and
[1:11:30] okay he didn't understand what was going
[1:11:32] on but yet you look at the progression
[1:11:34] of his life yeah
[1:11:36] yeah and all of a sudden when it got
[1:11:37] down to discernment of Spirit and the
[1:11:39] people having the different problem all
[1:11:41] of a sudden he could look into the other
[1:11:42] dimension he could see the things which
[1:11:44] were going on so more and more of that
[1:11:46] that other dimension became more of a
[1:11:48] reality to him than the dimension in
[1:11:50] which we're living here Amen in fact
[1:11:52] there are sometimes people said brother
[1:11:54] Bradham could not differentiate between
[1:11:55] which realm he was in
[1:11:57] because the other realm became such a
[1:12:00] reality to him right amen but here again
[1:12:03] we have to begin on Earth we were a part
[1:12:05] of God from the beginning he's trying to
[1:12:07] get us back into the into what we what
[1:12:09] we always are you always were amen but
[1:12:12] we have to be willing to accept this
[1:12:15] we have to begin to accept the fact of
[1:12:17] who we are and what we are because only
[1:12:19] only as we can do that can we begin to
[1:12:22] defeat Satan amen amen right the bride
[1:12:25] realizes who she is and what she is
[1:12:27] she'll be she'll do she'll be a common
[1:12:28] Invincible Army amen well then why are
[1:12:31] we defeated
[1:12:32] because we don't know who we are
[1:12:35] brother Brown says Jesus Christ because
[1:12:37] he can tell the story why he knew who he
[1:12:39] was he can go to he could find this one
[1:12:41] that was that had died he could speak
[1:12:43] the word and see them raise up he could
[1:12:45] do all the he could take bread and
[1:12:47] fishes and feed multitude because he
[1:12:49] knew who he was
[1:12:51] yes and one place he says I'm trying to
[1:12:54] get you away from the stare in this
[1:12:55] scare you don't know who you are you're
[1:12:57] not willing to accept the fact that you
[1:12:59] are Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:13:02] but we have to make the transition we
[1:13:04] have to get out of our thinking as human
[1:13:05] beings and we have to be able to be
[1:13:07] willing to accept the fact I was a part
[1:13:09] of God from the beginning
[1:13:11] right and now he's trying to use me as
[1:13:13] it is to express himself through because
[1:13:15] now is the time when now is the time
[1:13:18] when we are to come to adoption yes
[1:13:20] where our word is the same as God
[1:13:22] himself speaking amen but he has to have
[1:13:25] the preeminence he has to have the
[1:13:26] control
[1:13:29] and he said in one place he says he
[1:13:32] wanted to have the three things God
[1:13:33] wanted to accomplish what he had to have
[1:13:35] preeminence and amen he did that in
[1:13:37] Jesus Christ
[1:13:39] now he wants that same preeminence in
[1:13:42] his new body the church
[1:13:44] after that we'll go back to the eating
[1:13:46] condition yeah
[1:13:47] yeah but he has to have the preeminence
[1:13:50] amen he has to have the control
[1:13:54] until we're really until we are willing
[1:13:56] to relinquish the control of Our Lives
[1:13:58] to him amen he cannot do what he's
[1:14:01] wanting to do amen and once you can take
[1:14:05] and once you can begin to take your life
[1:14:08] and yield it to him and allow him have
[1:14:10] the preeminence and you begin to realize
[1:14:13] it's not about you it's about him it's
[1:14:15] not what you do it's what you will allow
[1:14:17] him to do through you amen all of a
[1:14:19] sudden then you would rest yes
[1:14:21] because all of a sudden you realize not
[1:14:23] me doing this God doing this right I get
[1:14:26] up in the morning and I have my list of
[1:14:28] things to do and I get a phone call
[1:14:31] Something's Happened and well that
[1:14:32] changes today so Lord what do you want
[1:14:35] where are we going today and what are
[1:14:37] you wanting to do today
[1:14:39] because it's no longer me at that point
[1:14:41] it's him right when I go overseas I
[1:14:44] realize I really have no control
[1:14:47] when I get back to the States I figure
[1:14:49] oh yeah I can still control my life I'm
[1:14:50] coming to find out no that ain't true
[1:14:52] either yeah because now God is wanting
[1:14:55] more and more to take control of my life
[1:14:57] he's wanting to lead me he's wanting to
[1:14:59] guide me he's he's trying because if
[1:15:01] somebody needs to be ministered to how
[1:15:02] is he going to do it Amen brother round
[1:15:05] says you are his hands you're his eyes
[1:15:07] you're his feet your legs your his mouth
[1:15:08] yes sir if he wants to speak
[1:15:12] he has to speak to somebody right yes if
[1:15:16] he needs to go someplace you have to
[1:15:18] carry him because where is God he's in
[1:15:20] you so you have to carry him to wherever
[1:15:23] he's going amen God wants to say
[1:15:25] somebody's hand he only has your hand to
[1:15:27] do it with hands have to be laid on
[1:15:29] somebody he has to use your hand yes I
[1:15:31] mean you have to begin to understand we
[1:15:33] are a part of him and he but he wants to
[1:15:35] he has to have the control amen
[1:15:39] because if God would release the power
[1:15:41] that is within us
[1:15:45] Moses had that power
[1:15:47] he was supposed to speak to the Rock he
[1:15:50] got mad he smoked it didn't bring the
[1:15:52] weather he smoked it again yeah that
[1:15:54] that made it so he never got to go in
[1:15:56] the promised land right amen I think it
[1:15:59] was Elijah or Elijah one of those and
[1:16:01] all of a sudden oh ball head old ball
[1:16:03] head and he ain't why didn't you go with
[1:16:04] you Elijah
[1:16:05] he got mad yeah call that a bunch of she
[1:16:07] bears and killed a bunch of kids yeah by
[1:16:10] the Ramses that was that was the voice
[1:16:12] of an angry Prophet yeah that wasn't
[1:16:14] God's will right
[1:16:16] so you understand the power that dwells
[1:16:18] within us he has to have the preeminence
[1:16:21] so that we do not use the power that
[1:16:23] dwells within us in the wrong way amen
[1:16:26] amen we understand in First Corinthians
[1:16:28] 15.
[1:16:29] he says we were we were God's seed was
[1:16:33] sowed into a body that's corruptable
[1:16:35] but it's going to be raised up and
[1:16:37] incorruption amen we have to go through
[1:16:40] the process we are going through we have
[1:16:43] to develop character
[1:16:44] or the browns's character is not a gift
[1:16:47] right character is something that forms
[1:16:50] in your body over time amen over time
[1:16:52] all of a sudden you get yourself in
[1:16:54] situations and and so all of a sudden
[1:16:57] it's how you act or how you react all of
[1:17:00] a sudden that shows the character that's
[1:17:02] within you yes very much amen with
[1:17:04] brother Branham there was one time there
[1:17:06] was a couple of young people they were
[1:17:07] they came into church and they started
[1:17:09] making love in the front of the church
[1:17:11] there
[1:17:12] and brother Brad says don't do that
[1:17:14] there's other places don't don't do that
[1:17:16] here he warned him two or three times
[1:17:19] and God says whatever you say
[1:17:21] that's exactly what it'll be amen if you
[1:17:25] listen to the tape there's a pause
[1:17:28] what was brother Branham gonna say Amen
[1:17:32] he says I forgive you for that
[1:17:35] because that's Christ amen amen how many
[1:17:38] other ministers would have said I
[1:17:40] forgive you for that
[1:17:41] how many other ministers Witnesses
[1:17:43] spiked Yourself Dead yeah you're going
[1:17:45] to be out of cripples here you're going
[1:17:46] to be you know
[1:17:48] how would we react amen
[1:17:50] I try to avoid Atlanta because there'll
[1:17:52] be a lot fewer drivers in Atlanta if I
[1:17:55] went through Atlanta yeah
[1:17:57] but see that be using the word of God in
[1:17:59] the wrong way I would demand them out of
[1:18:01] existence yes
[1:18:03] anyway but you understand what I'm
[1:18:05] trying to say on this but it has to come
[1:18:08] to the place where he has the
[1:18:09] preeminence in our lives where he's the
[1:18:11] one that actually has the control amen
[1:18:15] basically the union of the bride of
[1:18:17] Christ brother Brown says if you're
[1:18:18] married to Christ
[1:18:20] Christ is the word of God in Saint John
[1:18:23] the first chapter it said in the
[1:18:24] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:18:26] God and the Word was God the same was
[1:18:28] made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ was
[1:18:30] the Living Word he always was the word
[1:18:32] he is still the word he always will be
[1:18:34] the word he was only the manifestation
[1:18:37] of the attributes of God for he was the
[1:18:40] son of God yes
[1:18:42] he goes down he said and so were you
[1:18:44] amen amen Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:48] before there ever was a moon a star or a
[1:18:51] molecule you were Sons and Daughters of
[1:18:53] God you're you are only the physical
[1:18:55] manifestation of the attribute that was
[1:18:58] in God in the beginning right
[1:19:00] yeah he's relating us when he talks
[1:19:02] about Jesus Christ now he's relating
[1:19:04] that to us Jesus Christ was the
[1:19:06] manifestation of God because he was a
[1:19:08] the Son of God Amen but he said now also
[1:19:11] what are you you were part of that
[1:19:13] attribute you're part of that theophany
[1:19:14] so now you also are in a manifestation
[1:19:17] you are an attribute of God that has
[1:19:18] been expressed and so he's trying to
[1:19:20] raise us up into the level of believing
[1:19:22] this is who we are amen
[1:19:25] what God was in Jesus Christ he's now
[1:19:28] God in his in his bride God in his
[1:19:30] church
[1:19:31] he's trying to get us to Revelation this
[1:19:33] is what you are amen you are not sin
[1:19:36] just Sinners saved by grace he says you
[1:19:38] are Sons and Daughters of God that have
[1:19:39] been fully restored to your rightful
[1:19:41] position with your father Hallelujah and
[1:19:43] what God is trying to do he wants to men
[1:19:46] he's trying to manifest himself through
[1:19:48] you the same way he did through the body
[1:19:50] we call Jesus Christ amen Jesus says
[1:19:53] it's not me who does the work it's a
[1:19:55] father who dwells in me he does all the
[1:19:57] words brother Brown says I never do I
[1:20:00] never performed a miracle he said I was
[1:20:02] only standing there when God did this
[1:20:04] amen because he realized it wasn't him
[1:20:07] it wasn't about him right right but he
[1:20:09] was merely standing there and God used
[1:20:11] him in order for this to be to be
[1:20:13] expressed
[1:20:15] well what's the difference where does
[1:20:17] God dwell amen if all of a sudden God
[1:20:19] died with brother Branham where in the
[1:20:21] world are hurt yeah but if we begin to
[1:20:23] realize that the same God that dwells in
[1:20:25] him dwells in us and the same God that
[1:20:27] dwelt in him wants to produce through us
[1:20:29] the same thing he did through him yes
[1:20:31] sir it isn't us becoming prophets amen
[1:20:34] no it's recognizing we're Sons and
[1:20:36] Daughters of God yes it's recognizing we
[1:20:39] were a part of God from the beginning
[1:20:41] and now what he's trying to do is gain
[1:20:43] preeminence in his bride so that he
[1:20:45] could live his life through her so he
[1:20:47] can express himself to the world Amen
[1:20:50] yes we are in Satan's Eden
[1:20:52] you know um
[1:20:55] listening to a brother the other day and
[1:20:57] he and it talks about you know there'll
[1:20:59] be Darkness upon the land and gross
[1:21:00] Darkness upon the people and the brother
[1:21:03] said you know he used to be you know he
[1:21:05] tried to stay away from all these people
[1:21:07] with purple hair and
[1:21:09] tattoos from their fingertips to their
[1:21:11] toes or you know
[1:21:13] but all of a sudden he began to realize
[1:21:17] there the way they are because of the
[1:21:20] gross darkness that is upon them forcing
[1:21:23] them in that direction amen that's right
[1:21:26] that's right he said a lot of them were
[1:21:28] good people yeah in fact one of them he
[1:21:30] related I dreamed that brother Branham
[1:21:33] had
[1:21:33] and brother Brown said all these people
[1:21:35] were were in bondage they were in a
[1:21:38] prison and you know it makes the
[1:21:40] concrete and bars and all this other
[1:21:41] stuff and Jesus came by and said
[1:21:45] deliver them
[1:21:47] brother and said well how can I deliver
[1:21:49] them
[1:21:50] you know I I don't have the strength to
[1:21:52] break the bars and the concrete
[1:21:54] so he said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:56] Gates of Hell give way amen or something
[1:21:59] to that effect
[1:22:01] and once the word was spoken
[1:22:04] then all of a sudden all of a sudden he
[1:22:06] said you hear this crackle Miss crunches
[1:22:07] the bars fell down you know everything
[1:22:10] but it's the word yes
[1:22:13] it's being able to speak the word is
[1:22:15] being able and all the people were
[1:22:17] delivered brother the Bible says or
[1:22:19] brother around him anyway he said you
[1:22:21] know God was telling brother he says
[1:22:23] they're good people
[1:22:24] yeah but they're influenced because of
[1:22:27] the darkness that's upon them yes right
[1:22:29] that's all they know
[1:22:32] he says you know you the person that
[1:22:33] brother round talks about you know
[1:22:35] Pearson wants to deny that the son
[1:22:37] exists so it goes down the basement
[1:22:39] pulls down the shades locks the door you
[1:22:42] know and he has one little five watt
[1:22:44] light bulb gone oh that's that's all the
[1:22:48] light there is
[1:22:50] no there's a sunshine outside amen
[1:22:53] but see that's all they see yeah and
[1:22:56] everybody that that has remained in that
[1:22:59] basement
[1:23:00] that's all they see is that little five
[1:23:02] watt light bulb yeah
[1:23:06] well you go into you look at the at
[1:23:08] Society
[1:23:10] why is the perversion why I mean they're
[1:23:12] trying to take kids and fight and in the
[1:23:15] school system they're trying to have
[1:23:16] them go through sex changes and all this
[1:23:18] other perversion amen but they go home
[1:23:20] and what Dad doesn't know who he is Mama
[1:23:22] doesn't know who she is and they're all
[1:23:24] tattooed and head to toe and you know
[1:23:25] he's trying to be her and her she's okay
[1:23:28] but see that's all they see that's the
[1:23:30] spirit that's the darkness the gross
[1:23:32] darkness is upon them amen but you know
[1:23:35] the Bible tells me that in him was life
[1:23:38] and the life in him was the life to the
[1:23:40] world yes and so as we go and interact
[1:23:43] with people in in the way that we
[1:23:46] interact with in our daily walks
[1:23:48] the only light that they're going to see
[1:23:50] is the light that's expressed through US
[1:23:52] amen amen because in Jesus Christ was a
[1:23:56] life amen and that life was the light to
[1:23:59] men well if we hide the light
[1:24:03] and we all of a sudden won't let that
[1:24:05] life Express itself then then the world
[1:24:07] will remain in that gross Darkness but
[1:24:09] you know the the darker the world gets
[1:24:12] you can take a feeble little light
[1:24:15] and it'll shine very very bright yes we
[1:24:19] were in Carlsbad Cavern
[1:24:21] a number of years back
[1:24:23] and they turned off the light well when
[1:24:25] you're what 300 feet below ground or
[1:24:28] something like that
[1:24:30] uh I mean it's dark yeah
[1:24:33] and the guy waited a few a little while
[1:24:35] until our eyes would begin to try and
[1:24:37] find any light
[1:24:39] and then I just took you could take a
[1:24:41] candle
[1:24:42] simple candle
[1:24:44] you could sit in there and if you're
[1:24:46] distance
[1:24:47] man that shines so bright we could see
[1:24:50] everything
[1:24:52] right but see if we do not allow the
[1:24:55] life of God to express itself through us
[1:24:58] the gross Darkness controls yes but just
[1:25:02] a little bit of light it'll break that
[1:25:04] Darkness amen it'll make it so they can
[1:25:06] see a way different than the way that
[1:25:08] they're in yes and this is what God's
[1:25:10] calling us to do
[1:25:12] yes
[1:25:20] you know it's interesting when Adam and
[1:25:22] even followed
[1:25:23] Eve desired knowledge
[1:25:26] she says well look at all the other
[1:25:27] female animals
[1:25:30] look at them bringing forth children
[1:25:32] after their economy
[1:25:34] well I'm a female
[1:25:36] why aren't I bringing for I mean this is
[1:25:38] obviously what what I would assume her
[1:25:40] reasoning would be and that's where
[1:25:42] Satan tempted her
[1:25:44] but then there was the fall
[1:25:47] I mean she she did not
[1:25:50] she went to knowledge rather than Faith
[1:25:53] she went to knowledge rather than
[1:25:55] relying upon God
[1:25:57] amen and the sooner she left God and she
[1:25:59] took our knowledge
[1:26:01] she died yeah
[1:26:03] but then when God came down and the
[1:26:05] cooler of the evening he had out of
[1:26:07] where yet
[1:26:08] isn't this a time we normally get
[1:26:10] together in a time when only I come down
[1:26:12] and we Fellowship in the cooler in the
[1:26:13] evening
[1:26:14] anyway there was sin Adam says I'm
[1:26:16] hiding over here
[1:26:18] okay but you know
[1:26:22] when when in order for God to again have
[1:26:26] fellowship with his children
[1:26:28] God performed the sacrifice yes God took
[1:26:33] an animal and threw that animal and he
[1:26:35] took the skin of that animal and gave it
[1:26:37] to his son and his daughter yes
[1:26:40] he made the sacrifice
[1:26:45] if we are in Christ
[1:26:47] we are in the sacrifice God has made for
[1:26:51] us amen
[1:26:52] it's not about us it's about him yes he
[1:26:56] has restored the fellowship he has paid
[1:26:58] the price he has seen sure that that we
[1:27:01] have free access to God he has into it
[1:27:03] that there will be unbroken Fellowship
[1:27:05] between us and between him amen and
[1:27:07] that's his desire we are his children
[1:27:09] yes
[1:27:11] I mean the parents they liked it they're
[1:27:12] like the kids to come around
[1:27:14] you know even when they're being naughty
[1:27:17] I mean you know I mean I wasn't always a
[1:27:19] perfect little angel I mean
[1:27:21] there were times I had to stand up and
[1:27:23] have my dinner because I couldn't sit
[1:27:24] down for different reasons
[1:27:28] but I was always my Father's son yes my
[1:27:31] father always loved me amen
[1:27:33] amen I mean yeah when I did things wrong
[1:27:35] yeah it separated our fellowship for a
[1:27:37] little while
[1:27:38] but I was always his son my father
[1:27:40] always loved me yes well if I knew
[1:27:43] something wrong yeah I'll get you know
[1:27:44] spiritually speak to me I'll get
[1:27:46] corrected I expect to yeah
[1:27:49] but here again but
[1:27:51] God has made the way where I can go back
[1:27:54] and I can have unhindered fellowship
[1:27:56] with him because of what he has done for
[1:27:58] me at the cross amen everything I need
[1:28:02] is back there amen everything without
[1:28:04] exception we need healing the stripes
[1:28:07] they laid on his back before they
[1:28:08] crucified him that was for me amen that
[1:28:11] purchased my healing yeah so my healing
[1:28:14] has already been paid for that's right
[1:28:16] so why do I have to endure it
[1:28:18] all I have to do is thank him yeah say
[1:28:20] you've already healed me I am obviously
[1:28:22] here yes I'm just waiting for its
[1:28:23] expression praise the Lord okay and so I
[1:28:26] thank him for healing me even though I
[1:28:27] may not feel good
[1:28:29] because I mean here again I don't know
[1:28:31] any other way to react with this anymore
[1:28:33] uh yeah like I say if I
[1:28:36] have a fever and sore throat and a bunch
[1:28:38] of other stuff yeah I
[1:28:39] yeah my body tells me you lay down drink
[1:28:43] flavor fluids get some plenty of sleep
[1:28:44] yeah you will allow your body to correct
[1:28:47] itself yes
[1:28:48] I was having pains in my chest so
[1:28:51] I went to my doctor he sent me to a
[1:28:53] Cardiologist
[1:28:54] they did an ultrasound on my heart I
[1:28:57] said well don't we there's one little
[1:29:00] spot we can't determine if it's
[1:29:02] what's growing what's there is an inside
[1:29:04] or outside your aorta okay so they
[1:29:07] headed archive
[1:29:08] okay if that's the only way I I can find
[1:29:11] out what's going on okay go ahead
[1:29:14] you know and uh
[1:29:16] anyway they put put the thing in did
[1:29:19] this put the dye in and doctor says you
[1:29:23] ain't got no blockage nowhere don't call
[1:29:25] me I'll call you amen okay so I know
[1:29:29] that the heart the pains that I've been
[1:29:30] having are not heart related they're
[1:29:32] obviously something else indigestion or
[1:29:34] pulled muscle or who knows what but I
[1:29:36] wanted to know
[1:29:39] so I would know what to pray for yes yes
[1:29:41] I know my wife when we were in Youth
[1:29:43] Camp all of a sudden she fell into a
[1:29:45] shower
[1:29:46] for her her children are really bad I
[1:29:49] mean she couldn't even lift her arm
[1:29:51] we saw that we saw the the orthopedic
[1:29:53] surgeon and he he took x-rays or gas
[1:29:57] scans or whatever and he's oh yeah
[1:29:59] you've torn three muscle or tendons or
[1:30:01] whatever the thing is and uh um Okay so
[1:30:05] he says well he says
[1:30:07] over time it should heal itself
[1:30:11] and but we'll send you to physical
[1:30:12] therapy so you can strengthen the
[1:30:14] muscles and the tendons and stuff and
[1:30:16] for the next month I guess you basically
[1:30:18] she endured you know going to physical
[1:30:21] therapy
[1:30:23] and then we're having our youth camp our
[1:30:25] our cat meeting
[1:30:27] and all of a sudden
[1:30:28] um
[1:30:29] the spirit of God just kind of moved
[1:30:31] through the audience my wife raised both
[1:30:33] of her hands and just began to scream
[1:30:34] and praise God Amen
[1:30:36] she was healed praise the Lord yes why
[1:30:39] she had to wait till then
[1:30:42] God never tells us these things
[1:30:45] so he healed
[1:30:48] it wasn't the doctor it wasn't the
[1:30:49] therapy it wasn't anything else no it
[1:30:51] was God himself intervening on our
[1:30:53] behalf and healing her yes
[1:30:55] and so and and she she always was
[1:30:57] thanking God and then we went back to
[1:30:59] the doctor
[1:31:00] um deeper the appointment and she showed
[1:31:03] all the range of motions and stuff and
[1:31:04] he says wow you know and my wife
[1:31:06] testified to him
[1:31:08] yeah see God touched me and God healed
[1:31:10] me
[1:31:11] he says you know I believe God does that
[1:31:14] I believe in Divine Healing healing yes
[1:31:16] and so he Rejoice with us in the fact
[1:31:18] that God had touched her and God had
[1:31:20] healed her but it was another indication
[1:31:23] to him
[1:31:24] that God does do this yes
[1:31:27] okay amen right
[1:31:35] I might have quoted this last time but
[1:31:37] it's in the Legacy in church Aid
[1:31:39] brother brother Brown goes on and and
[1:31:42] talks about who who is Christ in this in
[1:31:44] the in in this generation he says he
[1:31:46] calls himself the author of the creation
[1:31:48] of God this is another creation this has
[1:31:50] to do with the church there's a special
[1:31:52] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:31:54] of that church the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:31:56] he's creating his own bride yes so God
[1:31:58] created you with all of your problems
[1:32:00] and all of your short timings and all of
[1:32:01] your personalities and warts and all he
[1:32:04] created you for the way that you are
[1:32:05] because he hasn't he has a use for you
[1:32:09] some people know how to take engines
[1:32:10] apart and put it back together again
[1:32:13] um I know how to put the gas in
[1:32:15] I know how to push the button to start
[1:32:16] yeah okay
[1:32:19] um other people like I say they have a
[1:32:21] better knowledge of that my my brother
[1:32:23] he understands computers and programming
[1:32:25] and how to do this that and the other
[1:32:27] and
[1:32:28] I know how to turn it on I know how to
[1:32:30] use certain programs
[1:32:32] I'm limited yeah he has a lot more
[1:32:34] knowledge than I have
[1:32:36] but God wired him that way
[1:32:39] but he's wired me this way yeah yeah
[1:32:41] amen okay I cannot become him
[1:32:44] he cannot become me I cannot become you
[1:32:47] you cannot become me amen he made us
[1:32:49] different yes he made us different for a
[1:32:51] reason okay so is but if God the Creator
[1:32:54] created himself his bride okay and he
[1:32:58] goes on and talks about Jesus Christ he
[1:33:00] was the god-man he was the son of God
[1:33:03] and he was of the new creation man and
[1:33:05] God met and joined he was the first of a
[1:33:07] new race and he is the head of that new
[1:33:09] race amen and we are a new creation
[1:33:12] we are no longer part of the old
[1:33:14] creation right
[1:33:16] amen we are distinct from that creation
[1:33:19] I am not part of Satan's End Amen that's
[1:33:22] Adam's creation right that's that that
[1:33:25] that creation Satan controls no I'm part
[1:33:28] of a different creation yes I am a part
[1:33:31] of a creation that God himself has
[1:33:32] created I'm a part of that new creation
[1:33:34] in which God himself has now coming and
[1:33:37] dwelling in me and God now wants the
[1:33:39] preeminence in me amen God is trying to
[1:33:41] express himself through me and so he's
[1:33:43] trying to show that creation there's a
[1:33:45] distinction between that creation and
[1:33:47] this creation praise the Lord you know
[1:33:49] he can only do that when all of a sudden
[1:33:50] I allow him to have their preeminence in
[1:33:53] my life amen he has the premise in my
[1:33:55] life that all of a sudden that creation
[1:33:56] can see a different creation and if
[1:33:58] there's something inside of them they
[1:34:00] will respond to that new creation yes
[1:34:02] hallelujah amen brother round says this
[1:34:05] is a true revelation of God
[1:34:07] uh
[1:34:08] days of the seventh angel and he shall
[1:34:10] begin to sound the mystery of God will
[1:34:12] be finished
[1:34:14] who is God what is God I'm looking at
[1:34:17] him
[1:34:18] right
[1:34:20] I mean in reality I'm looking at him
[1:34:22] where does God dwell today he dwells in
[1:34:24] you yes okay so so you are you are the
[1:34:28] true revelation of God
[1:34:30] but he has to get in and finish molding
[1:34:32] and making you into into his very image
[1:34:34] because that's the whole idea that what
[1:34:36] God is trying to do
[1:34:38] it's God who we're working in you to
[1:34:40] willing to do of his good pleasure amen
[1:34:43] he's not I mean I I like to do
[1:34:45] woodworking
[1:34:47] I take a piece of wood
[1:34:49] and if the wood could speak it says all
[1:34:51] right what are you gonna do with me so I
[1:34:53] take it to the I take it to the I run
[1:34:55] through through the planer
[1:34:58] take off some rough edges and smooth it
[1:35:00] all out
[1:35:01] the wood wouldn't like that if it could
[1:35:03] speak because all of a sudden a lot of
[1:35:04] it is being chewed away yeah and then
[1:35:07] all of a sudden I take it over to the
[1:35:08] bandsaw I sit there and I start cutting
[1:35:09] out
[1:35:10] perimeter and I mean that really hurts
[1:35:12] you know like cutting off arms and legs
[1:35:14] and stuff and then all of a sudden then
[1:35:16] I take another pattern I lay it on top
[1:35:18] of that and I start doing the
[1:35:21] end until until that image that I see
[1:35:24] now comes into expression amen right
[1:35:26] well that's what he's doing to us yes
[1:35:29] you've probably already gone through the
[1:35:30] planer you're probably already gone
[1:35:32] through the band saw and now he's
[1:35:33] sitting with the intricate work and he's
[1:35:34] starting to make the fine
[1:35:36] amen until the very image which God saw
[1:35:38] in the beginning now all of a sudden
[1:35:39] that comes into manifestation yes praise
[1:35:43] the Lord
[1:35:45] that's a brother round goes on and says
[1:35:47] his Sovereign power brought up the paths
[1:35:49] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:35:52] of this new creation
[1:35:53] he predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:35:56] children according to the good pleasure
[1:35:57] of his will amen by his omniscience and
[1:36:00] his omnipotence he brought it to pass
[1:36:03] it's not about you amen it's all about
[1:36:06] him
[1:36:07] Jesus prayed an awful lot
[1:36:10] because he wanted to find out Lord what
[1:36:12] are you wanting me to do today he never
[1:36:15] chose the twelve until God had showed
[1:36:17] him which ones to pick out yes brother
[1:36:19] Branham prayed a lot because I mean
[1:36:22] especially when you get to the latter
[1:36:23] part of his ministry because he had God
[1:36:26] would he had to be sensitive enough to
[1:36:28] the spirit of God whether God could tell
[1:36:31] him I want you to go here I want you to
[1:36:32] go there I want you to do something
[1:36:34] that time that that lady was praying
[1:36:36] and brother Brown was on a flight home
[1:36:40] that all of a sudden the plane was
[1:36:42] grounded brother Brown didn't know why
[1:36:44] he got up in the morning he was going to
[1:36:46] mail a letter or something like that and
[1:36:48] all of a sudden God told him walk yeah
[1:36:50] yeah
[1:36:52] brother I'm supposed to I'm supposed to
[1:36:54] meet up they're going to pick you know
[1:36:55] and God just I don't want your arguments
[1:36:58] just walk amen
[1:37:01] where am I no
[1:37:03] walk yes
[1:37:05] so he walked amen
[1:37:07] and finally there was a colored sister
[1:37:09] and she was leaning on the on the gate
[1:37:12] Martin Parson been waiting on you God
[1:37:15] showed me a bit he was coming by the way
[1:37:16] where's I think his hat or something was
[1:37:18] he didn't have on
[1:37:20] and brother answered do you know who I
[1:37:22] am no never heard of you before yeah you
[1:37:25] understand the revelation of the Seven
[1:37:26] Seals you understand the church
[1:37:29] all of a sudden the seventh seal you've
[1:37:31] got a revelation to the seventh seal
[1:37:33] right
[1:37:34] no no
[1:37:36] but she had a relationship with God
[1:37:39] she says I am not sure tonight woman
[1:37:42] where is your Elijah yes amen that
[1:37:45] prayer brought that plane down so that
[1:37:47] God's Elijah could go to her house and
[1:37:50] minister to her need yes amen we need
[1:37:53] the same relationship with God that that
[1:37:55] lady had yes where we could pray and God
[1:37:59] will God will change world events Amen
[1:38:01] to bring to pass what he what we have
[1:38:03] praise the Lord yes
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:10] brother Brown and the church in this
[1:38:12] condition he says on that day that John
[1:38:14] baptized Jesus at the River Jordan one
[1:38:16] of the greatest events that everyone
[1:38:18] said he could take in place taking place
[1:38:19] right there
[1:38:21] he said the Dove and the lamb United
[1:38:22] together that's when God and man became
[1:38:25] one yeah that's when Heaven and Earth
[1:38:27] Embrace each other Hallelujah that's
[1:38:29] when God was made flesh uh that's when
[1:38:32] God came down in the spirit form and was
[1:38:34] made a man and dwelt Among Us amen and
[1:38:37] God and man was made one on the great
[1:38:40] Memorial Day when John baptized Jesus
[1:38:42] yes
[1:38:43] and then then and then in making God his
[1:38:46] promise
[1:38:47] that was speaking of the time that Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ was baptized he said that was the
[1:38:52] greatest event this world has ever seen
[1:38:55] and will see yes until
[1:38:58] Christ and the church has United
[1:39:00] together again amen amen
[1:39:04] so when all of a sudden Christ unites
[1:39:06] with his bride
[1:39:08] he said that will be a greater event
[1:39:10] than when God came down and dwelt in
[1:39:12] that body because he's old Christ amen
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:18] brother Branham goes on in the Messiah
[1:39:21] he says now for instance when a man gets
[1:39:23] saved it's just like the light that
[1:39:25] comes into him is about the size of this
[1:39:26] little button on my shirt he talks about
[1:39:29] and talks about we are there there's
[1:39:31] where there's we dwell in three Realms
[1:39:33] the outer the The Flash and the spirit
[1:39:36] and the soul
[1:39:37] he said there's only one entrance into
[1:39:39] the Shekinah Glory where God can enter
[1:39:41] into him and take over in the control
[1:39:43] tower
[1:39:44] and that way is through self-will yes
[1:39:49] whether you will to or not
[1:39:52] it's up to you
[1:39:53] but that's the only Avenue that's open
[1:39:56] to man and God where God can come into
[1:39:58] his heart is by self will yes it puts
[1:40:02] him right back like Adam and Eve on free
[1:40:04] moral agency again you can choose the
[1:40:07] right or the wrong
[1:40:10] either one that you want to he can let
[1:40:13] that Spirit grow and take out all the
[1:40:14] roots of bitterness and press God's way
[1:40:16] through him again he can become back
[1:40:18] into the same condition that he was when
[1:40:20] he was in the garden
[1:40:24] yes he said you have to will to do God's
[1:40:28] will it just doesn't happen amen because
[1:40:32] your flesh is going to say I don't want
[1:40:34] to yeah it's time for going to church I
[1:40:37] don't want to I don't feel like it I
[1:40:39] could go out mowing grass I could go out
[1:40:41] fishing I could go out boating I I could
[1:40:43] go out hiking there's a whole host of it
[1:40:45] beautiful day outside why am I in church
[1:40:48] you have to Will
[1:40:51] there has to be something inside of you
[1:40:53] that desires to do whatever God wants
[1:40:56] done amen amen yes
[1:40:59] and like I said like brother Brown says
[1:41:01] you choose amen
[1:41:03] you choose to follow God's word or not
[1:41:06] yes you choose to believe God's promise
[1:41:08] or not you choose to do the things that
[1:41:11] you know are righteous or not amen it's
[1:41:14] your will it's it's self-will and so
[1:41:17] here again brother Graham says you have
[1:41:19] to choose
[1:41:24] I'd say otherwise it's you're going to
[1:41:26] form what's known to me as a bride see
[1:41:28] all right I'll go with you and I you
[1:41:31] will be a part of me you will be my
[1:41:33] bride my life will be in your body just
[1:41:36] like husband or wife was one person you
[1:41:38] and I are going to be one at that day
[1:41:40] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[1:41:42] fathers and me I am in you and you and
[1:41:43] me amen we'll understand the godhead yes
[1:41:46] how could Jesus Christ be God
[1:41:49] because the spirit of God dwelt in him
[1:41:52] and the spirit of God dwelling in him
[1:41:54] became the expression that God was able
[1:41:56] to fully Express himself through that
[1:41:57] body amen that's how God and that that's
[1:42:00] how God and Jesus Christ literally
[1:42:02] became one because that spirit of God
[1:42:05] had the control it had the preeminence
[1:42:09] oh I just love that Satan gets so angry
[1:42:12] at that see the Oneness of God all that
[1:42:14] God was he poured into Christ now the
[1:42:16] Christ was reported in the church there
[1:42:17] you are it makes them all one amen it
[1:42:20] makes them one it makes them one because
[1:42:23] it became God himself so dwelling in in
[1:42:26] him until Jesus Christ until he was a
[1:42:28] full manifestation of God
[1:42:30] and now all of a sudden it'll be God
[1:42:31] coming in in his sons and daughters and
[1:42:34] he will have the preeminence in their
[1:42:36] lives where literally God will be able
[1:42:38] to live his life through them yes and
[1:42:40] the closer we get to that The Closer
[1:42:42] we'll get back to Eden the closer we'll
[1:42:44] get back to the way Adam had in the
[1:42:45] Garden of Eden the closer we will get to
[1:42:47] the place where we we will not walk by
[1:42:49] knowledge we will not walk by how we
[1:42:51] feel we will not walk by the whatever is
[1:42:53] going around no we will walk by the
[1:42:55] direction of God and God himself amen
[1:42:58] will be God living his life through us
[1:43:01] and then we will become the expression
[1:43:03] or the manifestation of God
[1:43:07] Christ the ministry of God revealing and
[1:43:10] and in there there would be a Time come
[1:43:11] forth when he could express himself in
[1:43:14] the fullness of of his godhead deity
[1:43:16] through his church amen
[1:43:19] not just through the prophet no through
[1:43:22] his church yes sir the prophet God
[1:43:25] fulfilled what God wanted to fulfill in
[1:43:27] brother Brown's life amen and I'm not
[1:43:29] doing away with him I'm not trying to in
[1:43:31] any way in any way make you know put
[1:43:33] that down we would not know who we are
[1:43:35] if it hadn't been for what God's told us
[1:43:37] through that Prophet yes God sent that
[1:43:39] Prophet to tell me who I am amen without
[1:43:42] that prophet's message I would not
[1:43:44] understand who I am and what I am and
[1:43:46] what God is trying to do in my life amen
[1:43:48] but Hannah he says God can express
[1:43:50] himself the fullness of his godhead
[1:43:52] deity through his church have the
[1:43:54] preeminence in his church oh my what the
[1:43:56] anointed man now the anointed people oh
[1:43:59] my to bring back the anointed bride and
[1:44:01] and the bridegroom amen
[1:44:04] but but the eve of the last day she's
[1:44:07] not going to do it she's not going to
[1:44:09] fall she's predestinated to do it you
[1:44:11] know sometimes we wonder if we're going
[1:44:13] to make it
[1:44:15] there was a time when he lied to us
[1:44:17] having a bad day
[1:44:19] he went off into the mountain hit
[1:44:21] himself in the cave
[1:44:23] God says he's God said what are you
[1:44:25] doing here
[1:44:26] I'm the only one
[1:44:28] everybody else is forsaken you know I'm
[1:44:29] all that's left yeah I'm tired of
[1:44:31] fighting I'm tired of all the stuff
[1:44:33] going on just take me home
[1:44:36] I said what do you mean you're the only
[1:44:37] one
[1:44:39] I have reserved myself seven thousand
[1:44:41] you're not the only one amen I reserve I
[1:44:45] have kept
[1:44:47] God kept them yes they never kept
[1:44:51] themselves right God kept them amen God
[1:44:55] has a bride how does he how do we know
[1:44:57] he had he has kept her amen he has kept
[1:45:01] her pure he is revealing himself to her
[1:45:05] it's God doing it's not us doing this
[1:45:07] right we would be out in the world doing
[1:45:08] the things of the world we'd be in
[1:45:10] Satan's eating just you know enjoying
[1:45:11] ourselves out there if it wasn't for the
[1:45:13] fact that God had predestined us before
[1:45:15] the foundation of the world that he's
[1:45:17] going to come and reveal himself to us
[1:45:19] yes and by him revealing himself to us
[1:45:21] he's drawing us to himself until until
[1:45:24] more and more he he is taking the
[1:45:27] preeminence in our lives amen
[1:45:30] God reserved that's right that's why he
[1:45:33] has it do you know I says I hear
[1:45:35] ministers oh God's going to have oh no
[1:45:37] no no no no he has one amen I'm part of
[1:45:41] it
[1:45:42] I'm part of it yes how do you know I'm
[1:45:44] not out there in that world and and
[1:45:46] there's something inside of me that's
[1:45:48] moving me and guiding me and directing
[1:45:50] me and I'm pulling my teeth and whatever
[1:45:53] you know trying to get me to do what he
[1:45:55] wants me to do amen amen I mean if it
[1:45:57] wasn't if it wasn't for God guiding and
[1:45:59] directing my life
[1:46:00] yeah I wouldn't be able to claim being a
[1:46:02] son right I would be doing my own thing
[1:46:05] sure
[1:46:06] but there's something inside of me
[1:46:08] that's changing me from the inside amen
[1:46:11] it's molding my character and making me
[1:46:13] to become more like him praise the Lord
[1:46:15] yes
[1:46:20] Christ the ministry of God brother Brian
[1:46:22] goes on and he says when I see God's
[1:46:25] great power revealing himself and having
[1:46:28] first to reveal himself in Christ the
[1:46:30] fullness of the godhead bodily and then
[1:46:33] to bring that fullness of the godhead
[1:46:34] bodily into a people that he could have
[1:46:37] the preeminence the oversight uh the
[1:46:40] leading amen
[1:46:43] he said he was the first fruits of those
[1:46:45] that slept in the bride coming of Christ
[1:46:48] coming out of the church there have to
[1:46:50] be a shave waved again in the last days
[1:46:53] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:46:54] talking about it was waived over the
[1:46:56] people
[1:46:57] and the first time they will come forth
[1:46:59] for the bride aid for a resurrection out
[1:47:01] of dark denominationalism will be a
[1:47:03] message that the full maturity of the
[1:47:06] word has been has turned back again in
[1:47:08] his sole power and being waved over the
[1:47:11] People by the signs and their Wonders
[1:47:12] that he did back there yes
[1:47:15] the full maturity of the word has been
[1:47:18] given to us right amen that's what we
[1:47:22] have access to yes
[1:47:25] but he has to have
[1:47:27] the preeminence yes amen he had it in
[1:47:30] brother Brown's life it's true he had it
[1:47:32] in Jesus Christ he had it in Paul he had
[1:47:35] in some bunch of the others we could we
[1:47:37] could name
[1:47:38] but only as they yielded themselves to
[1:47:41] God
[1:47:42] could God fully Express himself through
[1:47:44] them so we have the full maturity of the
[1:47:48] word has been given to us
[1:47:49] amen but now it's us coming into the
[1:47:52] position
[1:47:54] where God has the control of us
[1:47:57] so that he can express himself through
[1:47:59] out yes
[1:48:02] what shall I do with Jesus called Christ
[1:48:08] he says it's a uniting time of God and
[1:48:10] his bride
[1:48:11] I believe the mechanics is here they're
[1:48:14] waiting for the Dynamics that'll take
[1:48:15] her off the earth into glory in the
[1:48:17] rapture
[1:48:18] the Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:48:21] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[1:48:23] have worked in a small measure while The
[1:48:25] Headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:48:27] the blood
[1:48:28] but when that head and body unites
[1:48:31] together the full power of the Holy
[1:48:33] Ghost will raise her up just like just
[1:48:36] exactly like that a
[1:48:40] H but even the last days is not going to
[1:48:43] be because she's predestined not to fall
[1:48:45] he knows that that he'll have her
[1:48:48] um he has a spot the church would be
[1:48:50] there without spot and wrinkle
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:56] notice then one like the first Adam and
[1:48:58] Eve before sin separated them in death
[1:49:00] now Christ the second Adam in life
[1:49:03] redeems his bride from death and now on
[1:49:06] his way back to the original original
[1:49:08] Eden restoring back his bride and
[1:49:10] fellowship back with God as husband and
[1:49:12] wife in the Garden of Eden Christ in the
[1:49:15] bride amen
[1:49:18] we were a part of God from the beginning
[1:49:22] we can accept that
[1:49:25] and we can accept the fact that God has
[1:49:27] taken in place his seed in US
[1:49:30] and the only thing that seed can
[1:49:32] manifest is the life that was in that
[1:49:35] sea
[1:49:36] and the life that was in that seed is
[1:49:38] the life of God himself
[1:49:40] that means the only thing that seed can
[1:49:43] produce is God
[1:49:44] amen amen but we have to allow it
[1:49:48] Jesus Christ talks about you take seed
[1:49:50] and you throw it on on you know I throw
[1:49:52] a sour sowing seed oh yeah the seed in
[1:49:56] one place is thrown on the Rocks there's
[1:49:57] no place it could get any any grass but
[1:50:00] no moisture another one of the ground's
[1:50:02] packed because people walk by and the
[1:50:04] birds are picking it all up another one
[1:50:06] oh yeah the seed went into went into
[1:50:08] another place but the weeds choked it
[1:50:10] all out but couldn't produce but he says
[1:50:12] every now and then Fallon's a good
[1:50:13] ground yes yeah is 40 and 16 100
[1:50:18] but see in the bride it has to be it's
[1:50:20] it's not Fallen by the wayside it's not
[1:50:22] falling the Rocks it's not no it fell
[1:50:24] into good ground amen
[1:50:26] and now God is trying to take that which
[1:50:28] was a part of him
[1:50:30] and bring it into full manifestation yes
[1:50:33] and so it could be God living his life
[1:50:35] now through Us Praise the Lord amen
[1:50:38] let's just close in a word of Prayer
[1:50:43] the most gracious loving Heavenly Father
[1:50:45] it has been our privilege
[1:50:47] to sit at your feet and to receive what
[1:50:49] you'd have for us this morning
[1:50:52] thank you so take the words that have
[1:50:53] been spoken Lord and Quicken it to all
[1:50:55] of our hearts
[1:50:57] Lord give me a greater understanding of
[1:50:59] that which I've been just preaching here
[1:51:01] this this morning
[1:51:02] the Lord you and I are one
[1:51:05] and now you're trying to live your life
[1:51:07] through me
[1:51:09] so Lord I take take control of this life
[1:51:11] they control the lives that are before
[1:51:13] me
[1:51:14] and so begin to buy your spirit mold and
[1:51:17] bake us into the very image of who you
[1:51:19] are yes Jesus said Lord we can be the
[1:51:21] full expression of you or yourself
[1:51:24] Grant this Lord for I'm asking it in
[1:51:26] Jesus Christ's name
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:35] foreign
[1:51:49] has given us today to understand for God
[1:51:53] to reveal it to us
[1:51:55] um
[1:51:56] it's not a matter of understanding
[1:51:58] something it's a matter of God revealing
[1:51:59] it to you yes God reveal to understand
[1:52:02] that it's God Christ in you the hope of
[1:52:04] glory then then that's what makes all
[1:52:06] the difference amen it's Christ in you
[1:52:09] praise the Lord let's stand if we could
[1:52:12] amen appreciate the message
[1:52:15] amen trusting and believing it was a
[1:52:17] blessing to you but I know of course if
[1:52:20] false our lot and our position to
[1:52:23] recognize
[1:52:24] that placement that we are and not
[1:52:27] necessarily
[1:52:28] where we came from although that's
[1:52:30] valuable who we are now although that's
[1:52:32] very important where we're going amen
[1:52:35] well God is laid for us and spoken to us
[1:52:38] and showed her who we are in him amen
[1:52:42] praise the Lord and I want to sing this
[1:52:44] little course number 544.
[1:52:48] creation
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:57] let's sing it
[1:53:01] Hallelujah
[1:53:05] [Music]
[1:53:11] [Applause]
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:47] I'm a brand new man amen let's see it
[1:53:51] again
[1:53:52] time Hallelujah hearing me
[1:53:58] and I've been born again
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:04] and I thank God he justified me and of
[1:54:12] his fullness
[1:54:17] I'm a new creation
[1:54:20] I'm a brand new man all things are
[1:54:26] passed away I've been wondering
[1:54:34] that's what I am I'm a new creation
[1:54:40] I'm a brand new man I'm a new creation
[1:54:47] I'm a brand new man foreign
[1:54:51] amen praise the Lord Jesus brand new in
[1:54:55] Jesus Christ amen the same yesterday
[1:54:58] today and forever yes amen
[1:55:01] power without character is satanic amen
[1:55:06] power without character you know a lot
[1:55:09] of times people equate that to
[1:55:11] Supernatural power but it could be any
[1:55:14] kind of power just power over your own
[1:55:16] life
[1:55:17] being a free moral agent gives you power
[1:55:20] do you know that
[1:55:21] and without the character of God to mold
[1:55:24] it in you to make the right decisions to
[1:55:27] speak the right word to do the right
[1:55:29] things to become the right person it's
[1:55:31] satanic yes that's why people end up as
[1:55:34] brother Noel was talking about living in
[1:55:36] that dark place
[1:55:38] amen they don't have the character with
[1:55:40] the power they have to make their lives
[1:55:43] and themselves Godly
[1:55:46] amen Holy Ghost
[1:55:51] born again
[1:55:54] of what you consider I guess
[1:55:59] I'll guess what you say today normal
[1:56:02] uh that's probably not even a word
[1:56:05] anymore but that power they have without
[1:56:07] the character then that's what you end
[1:56:10] up with yes amen they have power of
[1:56:13] decision I'm going to do this to my body
[1:56:15] they have that power without the
[1:56:17] character to mold it the way that the
[1:56:20] word says then you end up in the
[1:56:22] Darkness
[1:56:23] you end up with satanic looking things
[1:56:26] and uh
[1:56:28] the celebration of
[1:56:30] the Halloween and all that's coming up
[1:56:33] amen people know people know exactly
[1:56:36] where it comes from they know what it
[1:56:37] does they know the point and and still
[1:56:39] do it churches I I don't understand it I
[1:56:43] don't understand it but anyway I choose
[1:56:46] to live in the light amen amen but the
[1:56:49] power without the with the power without
[1:56:51] the character amen is satanic praise the
[1:56:55] Lord doesn't have to be Supernatural
[1:56:56] just decisions you make every day right
[1:56:59] where you conduct your life the things
[1:57:01] that you say the way you speak to other
[1:57:03] people
[1:57:04] amen that has value in weight and
[1:57:07] without the character of God molded in
[1:57:10] you like he said molded in you
[1:57:15] praise the Lord
[1:57:17] help me Lord I'm still growing yeah
[1:57:21] still
[1:57:22] still molding himself in me to be just
[1:57:25] like him
[1:57:26] praise the Lord
[1:57:28] be to the place that the reflection of
[1:57:29] Jesus Christ is so true in my life that
[1:57:31] people can't tell the difference amen
[1:57:33] amen amen praise the Lord I believe
[1:57:36] that's where he's probably that's the
[1:57:37] exactly one point said brother Noah was
[1:57:39] trying to make to us amen points he was
[1:57:42] reading in Christ and mystery God
[1:57:43] revealed or uh the uh and a couple of
[1:57:47] those quotes
[1:57:49] that's what that Prophet came to do
[1:57:50] that's one of the things yeah
[1:57:53] and what brother Noel was trying to get
[1:57:54] for us today so let that lesson be to us
[1:57:58] and let that character cause the only
[1:58:00] way that character can mold more in you
[1:58:02] is more of you has to die
[1:58:04] the only way amen it's like filling a
[1:58:07] glass
[1:58:08] there's only so much water is going to
[1:58:10] go in here
[1:58:11] if you try to put more water then this
[1:58:13] can contain it just flows out
[1:58:15] but the only way to put more water is to
[1:58:17] take more water out or you want to put
[1:58:20] juice in whatever it is you want more of
[1:58:22] Christ in you more of you's got to go
[1:58:24] away right die away so that more of him
[1:58:27] is alive in you amen that's what the new
[1:58:29] birth does
[1:58:31] lives in you continues to grow in you
[1:58:33] praise the Lord when he's born in you he
[1:58:35] does it's not a little infant and
[1:58:38] amen it grows into a mature adult
[1:58:42] Jesus said be thou perfect
[1:58:45] amen
[1:58:46] like my Father in Heaven is perfect that
[1:58:49] perfect is full of Age full grown mature
[1:58:52] and that's what he wants us to be
[1:58:55] in his word praise the Lord so God
[1:58:57] reaches to bless you and appreciate each
[1:59:00] one to come and coming in here today
