[14:56] Pentecost. And bless each one that have

[15:02] spirit that would try to hurt, hinder,
[15:04] infiltrate this service in any way that
[15:06] you, Lord Jesus, get the glory, honor,
[15:09] and praise for all that is said and
[15:10] done. We commit it to you now, Lord, and
[15:13] ask your blessings upon it once again in

[15:30] endure forever. Thankful for air
[15:32] conditioning. Sorry about last Sunday. I
[15:35] got here Saturday. Come in as I normally
[15:38] do because I spend uh several hours in
[15:41] here on uh Saturday and uh turn the air
[15:44] on and the the the fan was working but
[15:47] the pump was just the compressor was
[15:49] just clicking on and off and and off so
[15:50] it wasn't blowing any cold air. So, I
[15:53] was here about four. I limited my
[15:55] Saturday to about four hours last
[15:57] Saturday as it got hot because it was it
[16:00] was 88 in here according to that
[16:03] thermostat and it's at least 10 degrees
[16:06] hotter in the fellowship hall best view,
[16:09] whatever we want to call out there. It
[16:11] was hot out there. I had the fan turned
[16:12] around on me. Uh so, but uh and I did
[16:16] not I tried contacting Craig, couldn't
[16:18] get anybody to respond on Saturday, so
[16:21] unfortunately I had to cancel service.
[16:23] Uh but uh he texted me Sunday, last
[16:26] Sunday morning at 11:30 and said it was
[16:28] fixed. I guess he assumed we had
[16:30] service, but I told him I said we canled
[16:32] service. I I didn't hear from you. I
[16:34] didn't know if it was going to be fixed,
[16:35] when it's going to be fixed. I didn't
[16:36] know anything about it. Uh so anyway,
[16:39] thank you for your patience. Glad to be
[16:41] here today. Thank the Lord has blessed
[16:44] us. Amen. And we're able to come to this
[16:46] house once again to worship him. Amen.

[24:26] Yet he loved me.
[24:32] He whose glory makes the heaven shine.
[24:41] so unworthy
[24:46] of such mercy.
[24:52] When he was on the cross,
[24:58] I was on his mind.
[25:06] I'm not on an ego trail.
[25:11] I'm nothing on my own.
[25:16] I make mistakes and often slip.
[25:21] I'm just coming flesh and bone.
[25:25] I'll prove someday just what I say.
[25:31] I'm of a special
[25:34] kind.

[29:02] Oh, unworthy
[29:06] of God's mercy.
[29:09] [Music]
[29:12] Oh, when he was on the cross,
[29:17] you and I were on his mind. One more
[29:22] time now.
[29:25] He knew me
[29:29] yet he loved me.
[29:35] He whose glory makes the heaven shine.
[29:45] all unworthy

[30:34] looking at that precious blood. He was
[30:36] looking down and he could see through
[30:38] that blood. When God looks through that
[30:40] blood, he sees you as perfect. He sees
[30:43] you as sinless. He sees you as who you
[30:47] are in him. He sees you in the
[30:50] predestination that he made you to be
[30:54] from before the foundation of the world
[30:56] in God.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the devil try to defeat you
[31:05] with that.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let let the devil try to tell your
[31:09] less than who you are now.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You are a son or daughter of
[31:14] God. You are a child of God. And there's
[31:16] not a thing the devil in hell can do
[31:18] about it.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[31:27] Praise the Lord. He's so good, isn't he?
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good to us. Praise the
[31:32] Lord. I want to go to the Lord in prayer
[31:33] now.
[31:35] Amen. We have some prayer requests to
[31:37] bring to your attention. Brother Dennis
[31:39] is not with us today. As you all know,
[31:42] his wife Leah had surgery this week. She
[31:44] came through the surgery well, but she's
[31:46] progressing good, but she's very weak.
[31:49] And brother Dennis stayed home to try to
[31:51] take care of her. Uh brother Dennis also
[31:54] went to his podiatrist Friday. He's been
[31:56] having a lot of problem especially with
[31:58] the I think the right foot, but he's had
[32:00] ulcers on the other foot. Uh the doctor,
[32:03] the podiatrist gave him a special kind
[32:05] of boots for both feet
[32:09] um to try to help and told him to stay
[32:11] off of his feet as much as possible,
[32:13] which is kind of difficult to do when
[32:15] you're trying to take care of your wife.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Uh so please pray for the both of them.
[32:20] Leah is doing good. She is getting
[32:22] better. Uh just pray of course, brother
[32:24] Dennis. uh his sores would get better,
[32:27] his feet would get better, the Lord will
[32:29] just touch them both. Amen.
[32:31] Supernaturally right now. Also got a
[32:33] text from brother Danny this morning. Uh
[32:36] he's been helping his neighbor Patty in
[32:38] preparation for I guess as I'm I'm sure
[32:41] u maybe you don't know, Ron uh passed
[32:44] away. Uh the neighbor friend of Danny's
[32:48] that we've been praying for, he did pass
[32:50] away a couple of days ago. Uh had
[32:52] cancer. So, please remember the family
[32:54] in prayer, those affected. Uh, but
[32:56] Danny, I guess he just had a hard time
[32:58] sleeping, so he was able to be with us
[33:00] today. So, please remember him hopefully
[33:02] prayfully. They're both streaming today.
[33:04] Amen. So, please remember them in
[33:06] prayer. Also want to remember uh the
[33:09] floods, the people that are affected,
[33:10] floods in Texas. Um, wanted to certainly
[33:14] make that a point of of prayer for last
[33:16] Sunday uh as it had just happened that
[33:19] Saturday. But we certainly want to and I
[33:21] know you I know your hearts. I know
[33:24] you've all heard and uh probably have
[33:26] already been praying. But please pray
[33:27] for those people, those that are uh
[33:30] families that are left behind and
[33:32] families that lost little children,
[33:34] little girls 8, 9, 10, 11 years old. Uh
[33:37] just unfathomable, especially now with
[33:40] grandchildren. Uh right in that age
[33:43] range, it's just unfathomable what that
[33:46] family is going those families are going
[33:48] through. So, uh, please remember, I
[33:50] believe the body count is up to over 170
[33:52] now with, uh, over a hundred still
[33:55] missing. Um, so please pray for them.
[33:58] Pray, pray they'll find, uh, probably
[34:02] one of the only things worse than losing
[34:04] a loved one like that and that drastic
[34:06] and that quick is not ever finding them.
[34:10] Uh, so let's please pray they turn up
[34:12] and find them. Uh, however that works,
[34:15] so that that everybody can closure. We
[34:18] know those children before the age of
[34:21] accountability, they're going to be in
[34:23] heaven. Amen. So, uh we're thankful for
[34:26] that. We're thankful to know that and
[34:28] that the Lord would just uh uh bless and
[34:31] help those homes. My my both two of my
[34:34] mother's two of my mother's sisters aunt
[34:37] my aunts used to live in Kerbal, Texas.
[34:40] So, I've been through there, know the
[34:41] area somewhat uh and the that river that
[34:46] runs through there. So, uh kind of was a
[34:49] little bit personal to me too I guess in
[34:50] a way but uh certainly want to remember
[34:53] them in prayer. So good to see each of
[34:56] you. God bless you today. Anyone else
[34:58] have a prayer request? Anything on your
[35:00] parts today?
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Sister

[35:33] So, I appreciate your prayers for that.
[35:35] Amen. It wasn't as hot here as it was
[35:39] there, but in Houston, but the humidity
[35:41] there is uh sometimes even if it's hot
[35:45] here, you can find a little shade.
[35:46] You're you you can cool off a little bit
[35:48] there.
[35:50] It's like it follows you wherever you
[35:53] go. The humidity, if you've ever lived
[35:55] in humidity, I know the bats from
[35:57] Memphis and all is really humid in
[36:00] Memphis. Houston is very humid. Uh and
[36:04] uh so yeah, it was hot. Thank you,

[37:36] families affected directly and
[37:38] indirectly by the floods that occurred
[37:40] in Texas and other disasters that are
[37:43] occurred throughout the US that we don't
[37:45] sometimes hear about. Father God, may
[37:47] you be with us as remaining part of the
[37:48] service to move every hindering spirit
[37:50] from this place to interfere with moving
[37:53] of your spirit, Lord God. Commit
[37:55] ourselves in the service into your hands

[45:53] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Wonderful.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Anybody
[46:02] else?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Julie.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So, I should give my long aaited
[46:10] testimony real quick, as quick as I can
[46:13] make it. Um,
[46:14] &gt;&gt; go right ahead.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Go right ahead. Amen.
[46:18] So, as everybody knows, I had that
[46:20] seizure in December and um it was it was
[46:25] really tough. Um definitely something I
[46:27] never experienced before and it was
[46:28] extremely scary. Um but they they had
[46:33] determined that the seizure was caused
[46:36] by
[46:37] um acute respiratory failure, the severe
[46:40] sepsis,
[46:42] &gt;&gt; and it was all due to bacterial
[46:44] pneumonia. So, I was on four different
[46:47] antibiotics. I was intubated for 24
[46:50] hours. And um when they took the tube
[46:53] out because I had zero respiratory
[46:57] symptoms, no nothing. But I had a
[46:59] headache, a constant headache the week,
[47:02] the whole week before and did not think
[47:06] anything about respiratory. When they
[47:07] took that tube out, it was almost like I
[47:10] had again is what it just felt like in
[47:12] my chest. And um so I spent I was there
[47:16] for three days and dismissed on
[47:17] Christmas day with discharge. And um it
[47:21] was just really it was really hard
[47:24] because when I got the medical report
[47:26] they said that I had starting on the top
[47:30] of my head they were saying that I had
[47:33] small vessel eskeemic disease.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; They're they said I had a 1.4 to 1.6
[47:41] mass in my parotted gland
[47:46] and um let's see and then from QT in my
[47:51] heart which is the it's the the lower
[47:56] chamber is not
[47:58] beating in rhythm that it should be so
[48:02] long pause and I I can hear it at night
[48:06] when I'm sleeping if I'm laying on my
[48:08] left side I in my head um because it's
[48:11] just trying to be so hard. Um but I
[48:14] believe when Dennis prayed for me that
[48:16] day, um I felt just this wave of peace
[48:19] and that so I know that it's it's not an
[48:22] issue.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Just I you know just completely
[48:28] everything that they said. Um they said
[48:29] I was in stage three renal failure.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Um so they basically had me on my death
[48:33] bed really because when I was in the
[48:36] emergency room
[48:37] &gt;&gt; and I started having procedure. They
[48:40] asked my sister if I had a DMR. So they
[48:43] weren't really kind of expecting you
[48:45] know and I know that my sister reached
[48:47] out to brother Newton and um you know my
[48:51] family other family members who are
[48:53] Christian and um
[48:56] it was it was pretty funny because I was
[48:59] in ICU and they had they had residents
[49:02] coming in and all this and um every
[49:06] single person that came in on Sunday or
[49:09] on Monday when I was there they all
[49:11] said, "You are progressing so quickly."
[49:14] And I just I knew it was it's the
[49:16] prayers
[49:18] that were going up.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; And so I just, you know, that whole that
[49:23] whole scenario was just, you know, even
[49:25] even with my driver's license, I
[49:27] couldn't drive for for 90 days.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Um, I was sitting and pray and just, you
[49:32] know, praying about the whole thing
[49:33] because they said I wouldn't be able to
[49:35] get my EEG until April. And then I got a
[49:40] call 10 minutes later. I asked the Lord
[49:42] I said please for you know are you
[49:44] hearing my prayers and literally with 10
[49:47] minutes they called me back and said you
[49:49] know are you available March your team
[49:52] so it was I was did my five day
[49:55] ambulatory EG and um it was it was so
[49:59] nice because March 22nd was the 90 days
[50:03] the end of the 90 days and then I had
[50:06] was supposed to get my driver's license
[50:08] within 30 days of that 90 days And I got
[50:12] on because I went to the hospital
[50:14] December 22nd and then I got my driver's
[50:18] license on April 22nd. So God's perfect
[50:20] timing.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Was right, you know, like right on that
[50:24] day.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then sister was we were trying
[50:27] to she was trying to help me take me and
[50:30] then my niece got home and I just said,
[50:32] "You need to run me up there." It was 4
[50:34] 4:30.
[50:36] I'm like, "You need to run me up there."
[50:38] They last appointment was at 4:45 and
[50:40] there was nobody there.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; There's nobody there. Even sister and I
[50:44] earlier was just all these really long
[50:46] lines even before they open.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; So, it was just the whole thing. I
[50:51] started to take it so long, but I wanted
[50:52] to make sure that I got everything so
[50:55] that you know to really see what God
[50:58] did, how how drier the situation was and
[51:01] just what he did all the way from
[51:03] completely healing which I totally
[51:05] believe. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I know it's very wrong.
[51:14] So, Lord, please forgive me. Um, but it
[51:17] just
[51:19] not
[51:22] Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And I just I'm so thankful that he's
[51:25] just so much more real to me now.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Just he's amazing.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. The Lord Jesus.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God is so good. Amen. We had
[51:45] I have to give this testimony real
[51:46] quick, but we had
[51:49] probably the first I've been doing this
[51:51] job about three years. Probably the
[51:53] first what I consider mishap uh at the
[51:56] job. We were putting this big 150 200 lb
[52:01] uh apparatus up on a huge arch 15t in
[52:06] the air. Uh I was up on the top rung of
[52:09] a 8ft ladder. Other guy was on the top
[52:11] rung of a 8ft ladder. Two guys in a
[52:14] scissor lift over here trying to lift
[52:16] this thing up. and um just about had it
[52:20] put in there and for some unknown reason
[52:25] one guy that was holding it keeping it
[52:27] steady from tipping let go and I'm
[52:31] sitting here trying to put a bolt in and
[52:33] all of a sudden the thing starts pulling
[52:35] away and I'm like what's going on and I
[52:37] tried to grab it and it just it just
[52:39] kept going and I realized it was falling
[52:42] uh and I just grabbed onto the ar just
[52:43] fell onto the arch. The thing fell. It
[52:46] fell where there was nobody. Uh, and it
[52:49] fell 15 feet down. This 200lb thing fell
[52:53] 15 feet down to the ground.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; And it was fortunately was nobody there.
[52:57] It hit my ladder that I was on. Knocked
[53:01] it over into a hole. Uh, so if I wasn't
[53:04] holding on, the whole ladder would have
[53:06] just gave way. U, it twisted the ladder.
[53:09] The ladder was twisted sideways like
[53:12] this after that big thing hit. Uh but we
[53:15] just stood there for a second and after
[53:17] this thing was laid down there and
[53:19] everybody's like, "Okay, we're okay.
[53:22] Everybody's okay." Yes. So, uh
[53:24] thankfully the Lord kept us safe and it
[53:27] could have been a whole lot worse
[53:28] because that thing could have fell over.
[53:30] Uh, and you know, it did kill you. It
[53:34] hit you falling 200lb big piece of metal
[53:37] falling 15 feet in the air. Uh, but I'm
[53:41] thankful that the Lord kept it. Amen.
[53:44] Busted the motor up. So, they have to
[53:46] wear a new one. But, uh, we were all
[53:49] safe and I'm so thankful for that. Amen.
[53:51] And I believe that the Lord was because
[53:53] I felt like uh I I had I had gone up to
[53:57] the top rung of the ladder and I was
[53:59] sitting on I was standing on top top of
[54:01] an eight foot ladder. Two legs on the
[54:04] conveyor, two legs on the other and so
[54:07] it was already warped. It was already
[54:09] crooked. But as long as I'm hanging on
[54:11] to something, I'm okay. Uh but when I
[54:14] was on the top, I just felt I just I
[54:17] just felt like something was saying
[54:19] don't stand on the top.
[54:21] Uh, so I got down to the one rung below
[54:26] the very very top. U if I hadn't, I
[54:29] don't know that I would have had
[54:30] anything to stabilize me because it was
[54:33] because when that thing hit the ladder,
[54:35] I felt it jerk out from under me. Uh,
[54:37] but because I had my feet there holding
[54:39] it, it didn't go anywhere. So, uh, God
[54:42] is mindful. Amen. He knows.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sister.
[54:49] Well, the ladder was twisted, but it was
[54:51] still um it was still to the place I
[54:54] grabbed. I I had a hold of the the
[54:57] scissor lift and the arch and the ladder
[55:00] was still up. It was just twisted and
[55:02] this leg was in the hole. So, I just let
[55:05] go of the arch and held on to the
[55:07] scissor lift and just kind of inch my
[55:08] whole rung at a time on the bladder.
[55:11] Yeah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; So, thankful for that.
[55:16] A lot a lot a lot of things could have
[55:19] gone a lot longer than what they did.
[55:21] So, uh I'm just very thankful the Lord
[55:23] was present. Amen. Kept us safe. Amen.
[55:28] Praise the Lord. So, thank the Lord
[55:30] Jesus. He is good. Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet if we
[55:34] could. Uh we'll just go to the scripture
[55:36] now.
[55:39] Go over to uh back over to Romans
[55:41] chapter 8 as we read just first portion
[55:45] again uh to go back into the our
[55:48] adoption series. We're adoption part 20
[55:50] now. Uh position in Christ part four.
[55:54] Adoption part 20. Our position in Christ
[55:59] part four.
[56:02] Amen. And we'll go Romans 8 again
[56:06] as we have to start this series about uh
[56:10] on this adoption. Amen.
[56:14] Praise the Lord. Before we read though,
[56:16] could we just bow our heads for another
[56:17] word of prayer?
[56:19] Lord Jesus, so very thankful again,
[56:22] Father, of your blessings, your grace,
[56:24] your love, your mercy. Thank you for
[56:25] giving us, Lord, anything and everything
[56:27] we could ever hope or ask for. Thank you
[56:30] for your protection. Thank you for being
[56:32] so good to us, Lord. God, you know,
[56:34] before things are ever even going to
[56:36] happen. And Lord, you just give us that
[56:39] little uncction, just that little
[56:40] feeling, uh just something, God, that we
[56:43] know that you're with us and that keeps
[56:45] us safe. We thank you for your power,
[56:47] Lord, and for the strength that you give
[56:49] us even when we go through some of our
[56:51] most tumultuous times. We know that you
[56:54] are there with us and leading and
[56:56] guiding us. Lord, we don't know that
[56:58] what it might do to affect somebody else
[57:00] or uh make a difference in somebody
[57:02] else's life, just the things that happen
[57:04] to us for those people that are around
[57:06] us, God, and how good and how uh
[57:09] gracious you are to us, Lord. God, we
[57:12] just want to be a witness. We want to be
[57:13] a blessing. We want to be a an
[57:15] instrument, a light, God, to whomever's
[57:17] paths we cross. Father, whether they're
[57:19] in the hospital or whether they're at a
[57:21] DMV or whether they're on the job or uh
[57:24] our families or whatever it is, God, we
[57:27] just want to be that light, that beacon,
[57:29] that example, Lord, that we can be
[57:32] written epistles read of all men. Use us
[57:34] and bless us along the way, God, for we
[57:37] are your disciples and we need you, God,
[57:39] more than ever. We pray Lord Jesus now
[57:42] that you would help and speak this word
[57:44] to our hearts Lord. May it come forth
[57:46] with power and manifestation of your
[57:48] spirit and not return void but
[57:50] accomplish in us that that you sent it
[57:52] forth for. I truly believe Lord maybe
[57:55] even more than ever God. We are at the
[57:57] end of this thing. We are at the time,
[57:59] Lord, that every one of us, everyone
[58:01] that considers themselves a portion of
[58:04] your bride has found their position or
[58:07] is finding their position, their
[58:09] placement to get into, to live, to to uh
[58:13] to fulfill that purpose, Lord, that you
[58:15] put in every one of us, Father. And that
[58:17] purpose is your purpose, God. May you
[58:20] just bless it now. I commit myself to
[58:22] you. We all do, Lord. Pray that Lord
[58:24] you'd speak the words you'd have us to
[58:26] hear. Anoint our ears Lord to receive.
[58:29] We commit it all to you and ask your
[58:30] blessings now in the name of the Lord
[58:32] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Romans
[58:36] chapter 8. Amen. We start with verse 14
[58:39] again. For as many as are led by the
[58:41] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[58:43] For you have not received the spirit of
[58:45] bondage again to fear, but you have
[58:46] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[58:48] we cry, aba father. The spirit itself
[58:51] bears witness with our spirit that we
[58:53] are the children of God. And if children
[58:56] then hes of God join he hes with Christ.
[58:59] If so be that we suffer with him that we
[59:01] may be also glorified together. You can
[59:04] be seated if you'd like.
[59:07] Amen. Uh last time that we were together
[59:11] uh we left off with the adoption of
[59:14] Christ, the adoption of Jesus. a scene
[59:17] that we had scripturally
[59:20] of the adoption of Christ. So, I want to
[59:22] go back over there and I want to try to
[59:24] finish that part. It's a something I
[59:26] didn't get to read that we wanted to
[59:28] delve into and then try to uh
[59:30] springboard uh there's a few portions of
[59:33] this that I wanted to add to it to bring
[59:36] this along to one entire subject. So, I
[59:39] didn't want to really take that and
[59:41] break it into two different services. I
[59:43] wanted to try to give that one
[59:45] subcontext in at one time in one
[59:48] service. So uh so that hopefully it
[59:50] comes forth and it's uh that it's uh it
[59:54] uh it's received in such a way. So that
[59:57] was the intention. So let's go over to
[59:59] St. Matthew uh chapter 17 again
[1:00:05] read once again about this adoption the
[1:00:08] adoption of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now we
[1:00:11] know that Jesus was baptized. We've read
[1:00:13] that. We recognize that John baptized
[1:00:16] Jesus. Jesus came to John and said, "You
[1:00:19] need to baptize me." He said, "Suffer
[1:00:20] that to be so." But we are here to
[1:00:22] fulfill all righteousness. So you, so
[1:00:25] John had to baptize Jesus so the
[1:00:28] sacrifice could be washed before it is
[1:00:30] presented, before it's brought to
[1:00:32] sacrifice. So is so John baptized him.
[1:00:36] When he came out of the water, we saw
[1:00:38] that Jesus, the Holy Spirit came in and
[1:00:40] on him just as it did to the 120 in the
[1:00:43] upper room on the day of Pentecost,
[1:00:46] trusting that it is exactly of course uh
[1:00:49] what it has done to us. Amen. That
[1:00:52] anointing of the Holy Spirit on us, but
[1:00:54] also the indwelling presence of the
[1:00:56] person of Jesus Christ in us. Amen.
[1:01:00] That's the new birth. Amen. The new
[1:01:02] birth is the person of Christ living in
[1:01:04] you. Amen. But as Jesus was baptized and
[1:01:08] as he came out of the water and was
[1:01:10] filled with the spirit, Amen. The Bible
[1:01:13] says the spirit of God. Amen. We know
[1:01:16] that he continued on with his life, with
[1:01:18] his ministry, with all that he did.
[1:01:21] Praise the Lord. We also talked about
[1:01:23] even uh uh 10 plus years before that uh
[1:01:28] Jesus was leaving uh Mary and Joseph and
[1:01:31] going about they lost him and didn't
[1:01:32] know where he was. and uh they finally
[1:01:35] track backtracked and found him. He
[1:01:37] said, "Don't you know I must be about my
[1:01:39] father's business." So he was already
[1:01:42] being led of God. But we didn't see that
[1:01:45] adoption until here in Matthew 17 or
[1:01:48] Matthew uh yeah, Matthew 17. We didn't
[1:01:51] see that adoption or placement. Amen.
[1:01:54] The positionally placement of it. Praise
[1:01:57] the Lord. It can be He was fulfilling
[1:02:00] that life. He was fulfilling that
[1:02:02] ministry. He was living that life. Amen.
[1:02:05] Just as all of us do. But that placement
[1:02:08] didn't come here till we see in Matthew
[1:02:10] chapter 17. Amen. So people come the
[1:02:14] place they say, "Well, uh, my my new
[1:02:16] birth was my adoption." No, it wasn't.
[1:02:19] Amen. Separate things. The adoption,
[1:02:22] it's the the new birth, that's your
[1:02:24] birth. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's just
[1:02:27] like uh uh uh if a newborn baby comes
[1:02:30] into a family uh the b they go to the
[1:02:33] hospital and the baby is born and you
[1:02:35] know the the father they they they cut
[1:02:38] the umbilical cord and wipe the baby off
[1:02:39] the vipes clean and give it to the daddy
[1:02:42] it's all wrapped and beautiful and the
[1:02:43] daddy says now it's your turn to take
[1:02:45] out the trash.
[1:02:49] The baby doesn't know anything about
[1:02:51] trash. Amen.
[1:02:53] uh he's trying to positionally place a
[1:02:56] little baby and a baby's not in position
[1:02:58] to be placed. Amen. It might receive
[1:03:02] that later, but sometimes as they grow
[1:03:05] up, their very uh life and and and
[1:03:09] nature and all dictates. Of course, now
[1:03:11] God knows all this before the foundation
[1:03:13] of the world. But as us as humans, we
[1:03:15] may not know that till the children
[1:03:17] start growing up and you start seeing
[1:03:18] their idiosyncrasies and their lives and
[1:03:21] their natures and the way they are and
[1:03:22] how they live and what they do, you
[1:03:24] know, uh how they develop and and each
[1:03:27] of them you can raise them the same and
[1:03:29] they'll still develop different. Uh it's
[1:03:33] just the way it is because they're two
[1:03:34] separate people. Amen. And that's how
[1:03:37] that's how God's that's the that's the
[1:03:39] beautiful bouquet that that uh
[1:03:42] encompasses God's beautiful garden is
[1:03:45] all of us. Amen. Because we're all
[1:03:47] different. We're all different in that
[1:03:49] way. So we come along and we're raised
[1:03:52] and we live and and then this placement
[1:03:54] comes. This is the placement. Uh Matthew
[1:03:57] 17, let's read through this again. And
[1:04:00] after six days, Jesus taketh Peter,
[1:04:02] James, and John his brother, and
[1:04:04] bringeth them up into a high mountain
[1:04:05] apart, and was transfigured before them.
[1:04:08] Now, hopefully, I'm going to try my best
[1:04:11] to get to that today. I hope I don't
[1:04:12] have to break this up for time's sake,
[1:04:15] so forgive me if we do, but I'm going to
[1:04:17] try to. But remember, keeping that
[1:04:20] transfigured
[1:04:21] that word, keep that word in your mind.
[1:04:24] Hold that uh close because we're going
[1:04:26] to come back to that a little later. and
[1:04:28] was transfigured before them. Because I
[1:04:31] I want what I want to do is to take this
[1:04:33] subject and I want to parallel this to
[1:04:36] us,
[1:04:37] who we are. Amen. It's good to know who
[1:04:40] Jesus was and we should worship him as
[1:04:43] he is. Amen. And and give him all all
[1:04:46] love and benevolence. He's he's the Lord
[1:04:48] of all. He's God almighty. Every knee
[1:04:50] will bow and every tongue will confess.
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ is Lord. We know that. But
[1:04:54] what is what about us? Amen. What is our
[1:04:57] place? Where where are we positioned in
[1:05:00] this? How does it involve us? Let's
[1:05:02] look. He was transfigured before them.
[1:05:05] And his face did s shine as a sun. And
[1:05:09] his reignment was white as the light.
[1:05:12] And behold, there appeared unto them
[1:05:13] Moses and Elijah talking with them. Now,
[1:05:16] you've got God in heaven calling this
[1:05:19] meeting. Jesus Christ, the subject of
[1:05:22] the meeting. And he's brought
[1:05:25] representatives,
[1:05:26] eyewitnesses
[1:05:28] from to represent heaven. Amen. He's
[1:05:32] brought in Moses, and Elijah and earth
[1:05:35] with uh Peter, James, and John. He's got
[1:05:38] Peter, James, and John as witnesses as
[1:05:40] earthly witnesses now. And he's got
[1:05:42] heavenly witnesses with Moses which
[1:05:45] represented the dead raised and the
[1:05:47] transfigured, the translated, the the
[1:05:50] rapture. Amen. So you've got the the
[1:05:53] earthly representatives, eyewitnesses.
[1:05:56] You've got the heavenly eyewitnesses.
[1:05:58] Amen. That God has called here to this
[1:06:00] meeting. God's called this meeting Jesus
[1:06:02] subject. He's got his witnesses. Then
[1:06:04] answered fourth verse. Peter had said
[1:06:07] unto uh uh said unto Jesus,"Lord, it is
[1:06:11] good for us to be here. If thou wilt,
[1:06:14] let us make here uh three tabernacles,
[1:06:16] one for thee, one for Moses, one for
[1:06:18] Elias." While the yet spake, behold, a
[1:06:21] bright a bright cloud overshadowed them.
[1:06:24] And behold, a voice out of the cloud,
[1:06:25] which said, "This is my beloved son in
[1:06:28] whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him."
[1:06:31] There's his adoption.
[1:06:34] Amen. There's his placement. Hear ye
[1:06:37] him. That's Jesus placement. God spoke
[1:06:41] out and said, "This is my beloved son in
[1:06:45] whom I am well pleased. Hear him." Now
[1:06:49] Christ is standing in that placement in
[1:06:53] the voice of God. Because God said,
[1:06:56] "Hear him." Amen.
[1:06:59] the the transformation
[1:07:02] the transition is happening. Amen. As
[1:07:05] Jesus is transfigured before them and
[1:07:09] when the disciples heard it, they fell
[1:07:11] on their face and were so afraid. And
[1:07:13] Jesus came and touched them and said,
[1:07:14] "Arise, be not afraid." When they lifted
[1:07:17] up their eyes, they saw no man, say
[1:07:19] Jesus only. And as they came down from
[1:07:22] the mountain, Jesus charged them,
[1:07:24] saying, "Tell the vision to no man until
[1:07:26] the Son of Man be risen again from the
[1:07:28] dead." Now, look what Jesus uh look what
[1:07:30] brother Brown brought as an analogy or a
[1:07:33] quote, if you will, out of this event.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Obviously, just one quote.
[1:07:41] Hear ye him.
[1:07:45] March 1960. Hear ye him. Now you see
[1:07:49] Jesus had proven to God that he had been
[1:07:52] the right kind of son
[1:07:55] and God took him up on the on on the top
[1:07:58] of the mountain brought witnesses out
[1:08:00] there as we said heavenly witnesses and
[1:08:03] earthly witnesses and he clothed him in
[1:08:05] immortality. See we said it's rain white
[1:08:08] as uhh white as the light.
[1:08:12] When they looked uh when they looked up
[1:08:14] they said his garment shine like the
[1:08:17] sun. A supernatural something had taken
[1:08:20] place. His garments glistened like the
[1:08:22] sun in the middle of the day as white as
[1:08:25] they could be. God placed on him that
[1:08:28] robe of immortality, showing that he had
[1:08:32] received him.
[1:08:34] That's the thing that God will do to his
[1:08:36] sons here on earth. Praise the Lord. He
[1:08:40] will call you aside, church, if you'll
[1:08:42] only obey him and stay on that word and
[1:08:45] believe it. and he will place into the
[1:08:48] church the bride I'll say before the
[1:08:52] coming of Jesus Christ that's why
[1:08:55] essential it's essential that we
[1:08:58] understand the importance of this this
[1:09:01] very subject and of our lives and of our
[1:09:04] placements we consider ourselves a
[1:09:07] portion of the body of Christ we
[1:09:08] consider ourselves a portion of the
[1:09:11] bride of Jesus Christ then we fall in
[1:09:14] this place we fall in this this comes
[1:09:16] and falls our lotment. Amen. Our
[1:09:19] responsibility
[1:09:21] to us is to him. Praise the Lord. Before
[1:09:25] the coming of Jesus Christ. So, we've
[1:09:27] got to be here at hand because
[1:09:31] we are at that coming. We are at that
[1:09:33] time. Uh I just don't see how it's
[1:09:36] prolonged much more than what it is now.
[1:09:39] He will place into the bride church. She
[1:09:42] said, "Bride." All the powers that
[1:09:44] Christ had in him will be in the bride.
[1:09:49] All the powers, let me let that sink in
[1:09:52] for a second, saints. All the power that
[1:09:56] was in Jesus Christ, Christ will place
[1:10:00] in the bride.
[1:10:03] Praise the Lord. And what is there for
[1:10:05] us then to to worry about, to fret over?
[1:10:08] But what is there for us to to to
[1:10:11] stumble to? It can't be anything that
[1:10:15] that would draw us short from
[1:10:18] recognizing our position, our placement,
[1:10:21] what God has given to us, what God has
[1:10:24] done for us. Amen. We've talked about it
[1:10:27] before in the in the early stages of
[1:10:30] this of this subject when we were
[1:10:33] talking about Adam and Eve and Adam lost
[1:10:37] what he had what God had given to him in
[1:10:40] his inheritance
[1:10:41] and recognize that as he lost it,
[1:10:46] God brought through the annals of time
[1:10:48] back to a end that was the beginning
[1:10:51] back to the end times to place back into
[1:10:55] that bride.
[1:10:56] what he lost in the beginning.
[1:10:58] What Adam had, what he could do, he
[1:11:01] could name, say, speak, he could uh call
[1:11:05] things and move things, uh name things.
[1:11:09] It was all that all the power, all the
[1:11:11] authority that God had given to Adam.
[1:11:14] See, now that all that authority is now
[1:11:17] given into the bride, even more so,
[1:11:20] saints, we can recognize as he said
[1:11:22] here, all the powers that Christ had in
[1:11:25] him will be in you.
[1:11:28] Amen. What else do we need?
[1:11:32] What else are we looking for? What other
[1:11:35] proclamation, whatever confirmation?
[1:11:38] Amen. What what do we need to get beyond
[1:11:41] the understanding scripturally of who we
[1:11:44] are in the position in Christ? Oh,
[1:11:48] praise the Lord. Don't let the devil
[1:11:49] defeat you. Amen. Don't let him try to
[1:11:53] trick you, take away your inheritance,
[1:11:55] take away your identity. He'll try to
[1:11:58] steal it from you like that. If you give
[1:12:00] him a half a second, he'll do it, too.
[1:12:02] Amen. You belong to God. You belong to
[1:12:05] Christ. and all the powers of heaven and
[1:12:08] earth. Let's continue on. All that God
[1:12:11] was, he poured into Jesus.
[1:12:14] All that Jesus was, brother Brown, I'm
[1:12:16] quoting scripture now. All that Jesus
[1:12:19] was, he poured into the church, the
[1:12:21] bride. I keep saying bride.
[1:12:24] The transformation, the larger
[1:12:26] transformation of brother Brandham
[1:12:28] transferring that verbiage over from
[1:12:30] church to bride didn't really happen
[1:12:32] until after the seals. And this was
[1:12:35] 1960. So he's still saying church here.
[1:12:38] The reference there is the bride. Amen.
[1:12:41] Not church nominal, but the bride church
[1:12:44] spiritual. Amen. All that the uh all
[1:12:47] that God was poured into Jesus, all that
[1:12:49] Jesus poured into the church bride. God
[1:12:52] wanting his work done, he sent it into
[1:12:55] his son. The son uh uh wanting the work
[1:12:58] done, sent it into the church at that
[1:13:02] wanting that work done. Well, if you if
[1:13:05] he's wanting that work done, who is he
[1:13:07] going to work that work through?
[1:13:11] Us.
[1:13:13] Amen. We are the subjects. We are the
[1:13:16] one that God is working that work
[1:13:18] through. Praise the Lord. That's what
[1:13:20] we're here for. Amen. I've told you many
[1:13:23] times, uh, I I I'm just here to want to
[1:13:25] do whatever God has for me to do. And
[1:13:27] when I'm done doing what God has for me
[1:13:29] to do, I'm ready to go home.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What? Whatever that calls for,
[1:13:34] whatever dictates that, but it's up to
[1:13:37] him, not me. I'm here for him, not me.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm here. I'm only here
[1:13:43] for him. God wanting his work done. He
[1:13:46] sent it into his son. The son wanting
[1:13:49] his work done, sent it into you, the
[1:13:51] bride, the church. At that day, you
[1:13:54] shall know that I am in the father,
[1:13:55] father me. I in you and you in me. At
[1:13:56] that day, because the same power of God
[1:13:59] was in Jehovah, God rested in Jesus
[1:14:01] Christ. The same power that rested in
[1:14:04] Jesus Christ rests in the placed sons.
[1:14:07] The placed sons. Shall I say again? The
[1:14:10] placed sons in the body of Christ.
[1:14:14] Praise the Lord. That brings me into the
[1:14:18] picture. I'm a part of this picture now.
[1:14:21] Glory to God. I am an earthly
[1:14:24] representative. I am an earthly
[1:14:25] eyewitness. I wasn't there maybe on that
[1:14:28] exact day, but I'm a witness of it,
[1:14:31] saints, because I'm a partaker.
[1:14:34] I'm a part of it because God brought me
[1:14:36] and made me a part of it. He brought me
[1:14:39] into this body and called me one of his.
[1:14:41] Made me a part of that promise. Now I
[1:14:44] can now we can stand upon that promise
[1:14:48] recognizing who we are.
[1:14:52] Amen. And one of the hardest things
[1:14:54] people have today is recognizing who
[1:14:57] they are. Hear ye him. Amen. Praise the
[1:15:02] Lord. Now, what did he go on to say in
[1:15:05] this same chapter? In this same chapter,
[1:15:09] we can scroll down and get to the 20th
[1:15:12] verse. And G 17th chapter, same chapter.
[1:15:16] Now Jesus said unto them, "Because of
[1:15:20] your unbelief, for verily I say unto
[1:15:21] you, if you have faith, the grain of a
[1:15:22] mustard seed, you shall save."
[1:15:27] Not Jesus, but you.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Do you believe it? Do we
[1:15:33] believe it?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; We got to have faith to believe that.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he just told him. You don't
[1:15:39] have the faith to speak this demon out
[1:15:41] of existence. You didn't have the faith
[1:15:44] to speak to that demon and make it
[1:15:46] leave. But if you have the faith, the
[1:15:49] great of a mustard seed, you can say,
[1:15:52] praise the Lord, you shall say unto this
[1:15:56] mountain, remove hence to yonder place,
[1:15:58] and it shall be removed. And nothing
[1:16:01] shall be impossible unto you.
[1:16:06] Not me, not him. He said you nothing
[1:16:10] shall be impossible to us that bride in
[1:16:14] the exact same chapter where he was
[1:16:17] adopted and God said hear ye him. Well
[1:16:22] what is he saying? He saying you speak
[1:16:26] to the mountain.
[1:16:30] Praise the Lord. What a beautiful
[1:16:32] transformation.
[1:16:34] God comes down, holds a meeting and
[1:16:36] says, "That's my son. I'm pleased to
[1:16:38] dwell." You listen to him now. He comes
[1:16:40] down off Mount Churchfiguration. He
[1:16:42] said, "Now I have been I have been uh uh
[1:16:46] projected."
[1:16:47] Amen. That God the Father said, "Listen
[1:16:51] to me." Amen. Now, what I'm saying to
[1:16:55] you is you speak to the mountain.
[1:16:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:01] I don't know what other confirmation we
[1:17:03] need. Amen. You say, he said, here you
[1:17:08] said you say. Now it's up to us. What do
[1:17:12] we say? What are we going to say about
[1:17:14] it? What do we believe about it? Is that
[1:17:17] faith the green mustard seed actually in
[1:17:19] us? Of course it is. Amen. The the
[1:17:23] scripture declares that it is that faith
[1:17:26] the grain of a mustard seed is there.
[1:17:28] And we know that he says that how about
[1:17:30] how be it though even though that faith
[1:17:33] would be there this kind comes not but
[1:17:36] by prayer and fasting. Why? Because then
[1:17:37] that's that confidence. It builds that
[1:17:39] confidence. It builds that faith. It
[1:17:41] brings that faith to a level to receive
[1:17:43] on the level Amen. of epilepsy or or or
[1:17:47] moving a mountain which they could not
[1:17:50] cure this boy of epilepsy. Amen.
[1:17:53] Say to this mountain, you speak now. You
[1:17:56] can say what do we do with it? Are we
[1:17:59] going to speak it? Are we going to say
[1:18:02] it? Is it going to be what? But now when
[1:18:06] we speak it, it's only going to be spoke
[1:18:09] not on our human emotion. It's not going
[1:18:11] to be spoke on our human feelings. It's
[1:18:13] not going to be spoke on what we want
[1:18:16] done or what our human feelings or
[1:18:18] emotions might dictate. Amen. to say,
[1:18:22] uh, for example, I'll go back to my
[1:18:25] sister, my fleshly human person, Newton
[1:18:29] Bennett, wanted my sister Janice, to
[1:18:31] stay on this earth, to be my sister, to
[1:18:34] continue to live. It seemed like to me
[1:18:37] she had a lot more in life to do, a lot
[1:18:40] more accomplished. She was only 48,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; 47.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; She was only 48. 48 I'm over 10 years
[1:18:48] older than she was when she passed. You
[1:18:50] think she's got plenty, but she's my
[1:18:52] sister and I love her. I want her to
[1:18:54] stay here. I don't want her to go. So, I
[1:18:56] prayed for God's healing. The Lord heal
[1:18:58] her. But I've told you the story when I
[1:19:01] was coming down Interstate 40 towards
[1:19:03] Hullbrook from Flagstaff. I I pray I
[1:19:07] prayed for her like I had done. I was
[1:19:09] playing the tape, listened on the radio
[1:19:11] on the not radio, but the the radio a
[1:19:14] tape
[1:19:15] and I was and I started and she came to
[1:19:17] my mind. I started praying for her and
[1:19:19] the Lord stopped stopped me and said,
[1:19:21] "Don't pray for her." Amen. And again,
[1:19:24] baffling.
[1:19:26] But see, when God speaks, you know what
[1:19:29] to say then.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know how to pray. You know
[1:19:34] what to say. And we don't do it based on
[1:19:37] our human emotion or feelings or what we
[1:19:39] want. We do it based on what his purpose
[1:19:42] is, what he wants done. That's what
[1:19:45] we're here for. And when God said,
[1:19:47] "Don't pray for it's her time for me to
[1:19:49] uh for me to take bring her home." That
[1:19:51] was it for me.
[1:19:53] Amen. I ne I never prayed for my
[1:19:56] sister's healing from that moment
[1:19:57] forward because it wasn't I it's not my
[1:20:00] will I want. It's his will.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And unless I know that that God
[1:20:05] says this is this is the will that I
[1:20:08] want that's going to happen, then I pray
[1:20:11] what the scripture says. And the
[1:20:13] scripture says, "Pray for the sick, lay
[1:20:16] hands on uh and they shall be well," I
[1:20:18] take that.
[1:20:20] But if somebody comes up and the Lord
[1:20:22] says, "No, you know, I've had people
[1:20:25] come up before me and they've come up
[1:20:28] for prayer and I just the Lord speaks to
[1:20:31] me and I just I lay hands and I and I I
[1:20:35] just pray uh general God's blessings on
[1:20:38] them. I I've had to do that a couple of
[1:20:42] times. It's not a lot, but a couple of
[1:20:45] times I didn't pray for them to be
[1:20:47] healed. They come up for for healing to
[1:20:49] be healed, but the Lord told me not to.
[1:20:51] Amen. So, I don't. Brother Ram says if
[1:20:54] you if God puts God sometimes will put
[1:20:57] some a sickness or something on somebody
[1:20:59] to bring them back to him or to teach
[1:21:01] them a lesson or something, God might
[1:21:03] allow that to be on them. He doesn't put
[1:21:05] them on it, but he might allow that to
[1:21:07] come on that person to teach them a
[1:21:09] lesson or bring them back to him. I
[1:21:12] remember a brother uh a very well-known
[1:21:14] minister well y'all might not know him
[1:21:15] but from Tennessee u and he was up
[1:21:19] hunting one time and he fell off out of
[1:21:21] the tree and broke his back and his
[1:21:23] testimony later was I didn't know God I
[1:21:26] didn't know this message he preached for
[1:21:27] years but he said I didn't know God and
[1:21:30] I didn't know this message until God put
[1:21:32] me flat on my back and when I was flat
[1:21:34] on my back that's where he found God
[1:21:37] amen
[1:21:38] who knows why God does the things he
[1:21:40] does But we want to be there to be
[1:21:43] representatives of his. We don't be want
[1:21:45] to be there to contrary what God is
[1:21:47] trying to do. So, Brother Brandham said,
[1:21:49] if God put that sickness on them or or
[1:21:52] whatever it is to teach them a lesson or
[1:21:54] bring them along or something and you go
[1:21:56] and pray that off of them, then you're
[1:21:59] responsible for it,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that I don't want to be
[1:22:04] responsible for. I don't think any of us
[1:22:06] do. But unless God does that, we just
[1:22:09] believe with the scripture just as lay
[1:22:11] hands on the sick, they shall recover.
[1:22:12] That's what we do. Amen. Pray for them.
[1:22:15] That's what we do. Because that's what
[1:22:18] the scripture says. Unless it's
[1:22:19] something different, then that's what we
[1:22:21] do. Amen. But we do it in accordance to
[1:22:24] God's word. Not what we want. Amen. But
[1:22:27] what God's word wants. How many times
[1:22:29] have I said that we may pray for God,
[1:22:32] pray for something from God and pray it
[1:22:34] and want something to happen and want
[1:22:36] God to do it and God's trying to do it
[1:22:38] and he's working in a way that you never
[1:22:40] imagined would happen and and you you
[1:22:43] pray another way or you want a certain
[1:22:45] way or something and God's trying to
[1:22:47] work God's trying to work out your
[1:22:49] prayer request and and you're hindering
[1:22:51] it because he's not doing it the way you
[1:22:53] wanted him to do it or the way that you
[1:22:56] expected him to do
[1:22:58] But just let God do the work. That
[1:23:00] that's the main thing. Just let him do
[1:23:03] the work. So so many times God is
[1:23:05] working on your behalf and you don't
[1:23:08] even realize it. Sometimes he's working
[1:23:10] on our behalf and we don't like the way
[1:23:13] he's working it.
[1:23:15] Who cares how he does it as long as it
[1:23:17] gets done because the end result is what
[1:23:19] we want the most anyway, right?
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. That's
[1:23:23] what we want from God is the end result.
[1:23:25] Amen. God being transfigured before
[1:23:29] them. Let's go over to Philippians. Now,
[1:23:32] I want to continue this subject. I want
[1:23:35] to try to build these together before we
[1:23:37] leave.
[1:23:40] Philippians chapter 2. I hope we've at
[1:23:42] least garnered a portion of
[1:23:43] understanding
[1:23:45] what we're what we're talking about and
[1:23:47] bringing this together. Amen. Wasn't
[1:23:50] just Jesus that was adopted. It wasn't
[1:23:53] just Jesus that was to speak. Amen. It
[1:23:57] brings us together down to here for us
[1:24:00] today. That's why there were earthly
[1:24:02] representatives there. Amen. To
[1:24:05] represent those of us who are still here
[1:24:08] living here. Philippians chapter 2.
[1:24:12] Very familiar scripture. One of my
[1:24:14] favorites actually. Philippians 2. We'll
[1:24:17] just let's skip down instead of u
[1:24:21] uh well, let me just read through
[1:24:23] quickly the first verse. I just love it
[1:24:25] all. So if there be therefore any
[1:24:27] consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
[1:24:30] love, if any fellowship of the spirit,
[1:24:33] if any bows and mercies, fulfill ye my
[1:24:36] joy, that ye be likeminded, having the
[1:24:39] same love, being of one accord of one
[1:24:41] mind. Let nothing be done through strife
[1:24:44] or vain glory, but in loneliness of
[1:24:46] mind, let each esteem other better than
[1:24:50] themselves. Look not every man on his
[1:24:53] own things, but every man also on the
[1:24:55] things of others. Let this mind, let's
[1:24:59] just let's look here now.
[1:25:02] Let this mind be in you which was also
[1:25:06] in Christ Jesus, who being in the form
[1:25:09] of God,
[1:25:11] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:25:14] God. That form is amorpha. Amen. Which
[1:25:17] we've discussed many times. To amorpha.
[1:25:20] Amen. Same person, two different masks.
[1:25:24] That's what it that's what it represent.
[1:25:25] Not two different people. That's where
[1:25:27] so many people get lost or mixed up in
[1:25:30] their Trinity doctrine. They think it's
[1:25:32] different people. It's not different
[1:25:34] people. It's not different
[1:25:35] personalities. It's one God. Amen. In
[1:25:38] these different offices, he's changing
[1:25:40] his mask. Amen. Because he's God. He can
[1:25:43] do that. Amen. He God is not limited to
[1:25:47] your scientific or medical proof. Amen.
[1:25:51] God is not limited to what your mind
[1:25:53] could imagine him to be. God is
[1:25:56] unimaginably
[1:25:58] uh beyond anything we can comprehend.
[1:26:02] Who being in the form of God thought it
[1:26:04] not Robert to be equal with God, but
[1:26:05] made himself of no reputation,
[1:26:08] and took upon him the form of a servant.
[1:26:12] Took upon him the form of a servant. was
[1:26:15] made in the likeness of men. And being
[1:26:18] found in fashion as a man, he humbled
[1:26:21] himself and became obedient unto death,
[1:26:24] even the death of the cross,
[1:26:27] becoming a servant. Amen. having the
[1:26:31] mind of God, being in the form immora of
[1:26:35] God, thought it not rather to be equal
[1:26:37] with God, but made himself of no
[1:26:39] reputation, become a servant,
[1:26:42] humbled himself to death the death of
[1:26:44] the cross. Therefore, or wherefore God
[1:26:46] also hath mightily exalted him and given
[1:26:50] him a name which is above every name,
[1:26:52] that in the name of Jesus, every knee
[1:26:54] should bow of things in uh heaven and
[1:26:56] things in earth and things under the
[1:26:58] earth, that every tongue should confess
[1:27:01] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[1:27:03] of God the Father. Amen. Transformed,
[1:27:08] immorphed in the form of God as a
[1:27:11] servant. Amen. As a servant. Let's go
[1:27:14] over to Galatians real quick.
[1:27:19] Galatians chapter 4.
[1:27:25] And then Galatians 4:1. Now I say that
[1:27:28] the heir,
[1:27:30] as long as he is a child, giveth nothing
[1:27:34] from a servant. Now he's the heir.
[1:27:37] Praise. He's the posterity.
[1:27:40] But as long as he is a child, giveth
[1:27:43] nothing from a servant. Amen. From a
[1:27:46] servant. What did Jesus do? Put on the
[1:27:49] form of a servant. Morphet God in flesh.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Though he be lord of all, but is
[1:27:58] under tutors, governors until the time
[1:28:00] appointed of the father. Even so in the
[1:28:04] the dispensation of times. Amen. which
[1:28:07] we keep in mind as we continue on this.
[1:28:10] Even so, we when we were children were
[1:28:12] in bondage under the elements of the
[1:28:14] world. But when the fullness of time was
[1:28:17] come, or when it unfolded to bring this
[1:28:20] to pass, God sent forth his son made of
[1:28:24] a woman made under the law to redeem
[1:28:27] them that were under the law, that we
[1:28:29] might receive the adoption of sons.
[1:28:33] Praise the Lord. that we might receive
[1:28:36] the adoption of sons. And because ye are
[1:28:40] sons, God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:28:42] his son into your hearts crying aba
[1:28:45] father. There it is again.
[1:28:49] Paul using that in Romans and now in
[1:28:51] Galatians.
[1:28:52] Wherefore, father, father, see thou art
[1:28:55] my father, right? Wherefore thou art no
[1:28:58] more a servant but a son. And if a son
[1:29:02] then an heir of God through Christ who
[1:29:06] himself took on the form of a servant.
[1:29:10] Amen. And became obedient even to the
[1:29:13] death of the cross became obedient as a
[1:29:16] servant. Amen. But as it as it issued
[1:29:21] forth, as we grow and grow in Christ and
[1:29:26] take on the form of God, baptize,
[1:29:28] receive the Holy Ghost, new birth, we
[1:29:31] continue to live and continue to do. God
[1:29:34] places us, God puts us in the placement
[1:29:37] where he wants us to be. Amen. I believe
[1:29:41] I told you it was
[1:29:43] it was a little while a several months
[1:29:46] after I believed receive being baptized
[1:29:48] and receiving the Holy Ghost that I felt
[1:29:50] a calling on my life to to minister. And
[1:29:54] then it was four years I believe it was
[1:29:57] four or six years something like that
[1:29:59] even after that where I felt like the
[1:30:02] Lord called me to be a pastor part of
[1:30:04] the ministry. Amen. As God continued to
[1:30:08] unfold this, you say, "God knows what
[1:30:11] you're going to be. God knows who you're
[1:30:13] going to be. God knows what you're going
[1:30:15] to do." Absolutely. But you, we have to
[1:30:20] go through that process to get us to the
[1:30:23] fullness of that time. And when the
[1:30:26] fullness of that time comes, then God
[1:30:29] places you and puts you in that position
[1:30:32] at that time. When that time unfolds,
[1:30:35] just like he did Christ, he does the
[1:30:38] same thing for us. Amen. He shows us
[1:30:41] that same thing. He reveals to us that
[1:30:43] same thing. Amen. Imorph as a servant,
[1:30:47] though he be Lord of all, immort.
[1:30:54] Praise the Lord. That's what he did for
[1:30:55] us.
[1:30:57] Amen. Now, look at this in Romans. Let's
[1:31:01] go back to Romans if we could. Chapter
[1:31:03] 12.
[1:31:05] Romans chapter 12.
[1:31:14] Praise the Lord. Romans chapter 12.
[1:31:20] I'm just going to uh read one verse.
[1:31:24] Romans 12:2.
[1:31:27] Be not conformed to this world, but be
[1:31:31] ye transformed.
[1:31:34] Be ye you. Amen. Yes. Jesus had his
[1:31:40] mount transfiguration experience.
[1:31:44] But you know the same word is
[1:31:46] transformed
[1:31:47] is the same word as transfigured.
[1:31:52] So as Christ had his mount of
[1:31:55] transfiguration experience,
[1:31:58] the Bible Paul inspiration to Romans is
[1:32:02] to the Roman church is telling them to
[1:32:05] not not conform themselves to the world.
[1:32:09] Amen. But to be transformed by the
[1:32:12] renewing of your mind to have that
[1:32:16] transfiguration
[1:32:18] experience yourself.
[1:32:21] Now God may not as you could see visibly
[1:32:25] or audibly have Moses and Elijah and
[1:32:29] Peter, James and John, but the same
[1:32:32] experience takes place in every one of
[1:32:34] us like it did Christ.
[1:32:38] A transfiguration
[1:32:40] be transformed. Same word. Amen. Again,
[1:32:44] same word. Go look at the Greek. Same
[1:32:46] word. Transfigured. Transformed. Same
[1:32:48] word. to be transformed.
[1:32:51] Amen. By the renewing of your mind, the
[1:32:55] renewing of your mind in morphing.
[1:32:59] That you may be uh that you may prove
[1:33:02] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:33:04] perfect will of God. We transform. We
[1:33:09] are to have our own transfiguration
[1:33:14] experience.
[1:33:16] mount of transfiguration experience
[1:33:18] where God is placing
[1:33:21] you
[1:33:23] placing of the sons. That's why we want
[1:33:26] have this as our position in Christ to
[1:33:30] place you to have that same experience.
[1:33:34] Amen. To have that same experience as
[1:33:36] Jesus said here you
[1:33:40] you say amen. That's why brother
[1:33:43] Brandham said, "God is pleased to honor
[1:33:45] your word." Amen. Because it places you
[1:33:49] in that position.
[1:33:52] The adoption puts you in that position.
[1:33:56] Praise the Lord. Now, let's go look at
[1:34:01] um Ephesians.
[1:34:05] Ephesians chapter one.
[1:34:10] I got a couple more scriptures I want to
[1:34:12] make this point with if we can here.
[1:34:15] Give me a minute.
[1:34:20] Praise the Lord. We all had that
[1:34:23] experience, saints. We all had that
[1:34:25] time, that experience where God places
[1:34:28] that in us.
[1:34:30] I don't know that people call it uh in
[1:34:34] the world would use maybe the word
[1:34:37] epiphany. People say, "I had an
[1:34:39] epiphany." Uh, that's a really strange
[1:34:43] word to hear or say in my opinion. Uh,
[1:34:46] what an epiphany is, basically, what an
[1:34:50] epiphany is is simply an enlightenment.
[1:34:54] It just means that some some light has
[1:34:58] come down
[1:35:00] that something that you didn't see
[1:35:02] before, now you can see it.
[1:35:05] It brings you into another level of
[1:35:07] recognition.
[1:35:09] Whatever it is, the world uses the word
[1:35:11] epiphany. I came to an epiphany. Uh,
[1:35:14] again, real weird word to me. Epiphany.
[1:35:18] Anyway, the world the the world comes to
[1:35:21] an epiphany. You come to a place of
[1:35:24] revelation where God reveals to you what
[1:35:28] it is. and something that maybe was
[1:35:31] previously hidden to you, something that
[1:35:33] you may not have recognized before, God
[1:35:37] brings light upon that and shines it to
[1:35:39] you and shows to you that whatever it
[1:35:43] is.
[1:35:45] Amen. This position, this place, that's
[1:35:47] nothing more than a transfiguration,
[1:35:50] a transforming
[1:35:52] from that point transformed you and and
[1:35:55] put you in that place, in that position.
[1:35:57] Look friends, whether whether you're
[1:36:00] sinner or saint, whether you're godly,
[1:36:02] ungodly, whether you're an atheist,
[1:36:04] agnostic or Christian, whether you're
[1:36:06] Catholic or uh Buddhist or what the
[1:36:10] whole world,
[1:36:12] I don't believe there's a single person
[1:36:15] in this world that does not want to know
[1:36:18] what their purpose in life is.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; That does not want to know why they're
[1:36:23] here.
[1:36:26] What are you on this earth for?
[1:36:28] What are what po p purpose are you
[1:36:31] supposed to fulfill? Again, I I think
[1:36:34] the world is so devoid of that today.
[1:36:36] That's why you see a lot of the homeless
[1:36:38] people we see. They have no purpose.
[1:36:41] They don't know what their purpose is.
[1:36:43] That's why you see a lot of people that
[1:36:45] don't don't don't know their position
[1:36:47] even in Christ or in even in a church
[1:36:50] going to a church. Amen. There's
[1:36:53] involvement. There's position. There's
[1:36:55] uh there's there's a placement. There's
[1:36:57] a belonging to people want to belong to
[1:37:00] something. They want to be a part of
[1:37:01] something. They want to be involved in
[1:37:02] something. Amen. And and and so many
[1:37:07] people today, they don't even they don't
[1:37:08] even know what that is. They don't know
[1:37:10] who they are. They don't know why
[1:37:12] they're here. They don't know what their
[1:37:13] point in life is.
[1:37:15] Are they just supposed to heat up a
[1:37:17] frozen sidewalk?
[1:37:19] Are they supposed to just be a good
[1:37:21] graphic artist on the signs, please
[1:37:23] help, or something?
[1:37:25] what what is that purpose? They don't
[1:37:26] know. So many people that if they knew
[1:37:29] if they were given a purpose and had a
[1:37:32] purpose and see that's that just goes I
[1:37:35] I know I'm prolonging this. I'm sorry.
[1:37:36] That just goes right back to the the the
[1:37:39] pure u obliteration the pure uh uh
[1:37:44] misunderstanding of love.
[1:37:48] People have pe people have have so uh
[1:37:53] abused and misused the word love. They
[1:37:56] have no the world has no idea what love
[1:37:59] what true love really is. They don't
[1:38:01] know. Amen. And so they say, "Well, let
[1:38:05] let's just leave these people alone and
[1:38:07] and just uh patronize them or
[1:38:09] something." That's showing love. No. No.
[1:38:11] Not to me. Amen. You think God would do
[1:38:14] that if you did that spiritually?
[1:38:17] If you belong to him, God's going to
[1:38:19] give you some good protoplasm
[1:38:20] stimulation and get you up off your butt
[1:38:23] and put you to work and make you do
[1:38:25] something and have a purpose in life and
[1:38:28] do something with yourself and live the
[1:38:31] life you're supposed to live. Be the
[1:38:33] person you're supposed to be. But no,
[1:38:35] humans, they're just, you know, that's
[1:38:36] okay. No,
[1:38:39] there there's there should be a purpose
[1:38:42] for this person lay out on the ground
[1:38:43] out here.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; They should be able to fulfill a
[1:38:46] purpose. They should be a contributor to
[1:38:48] this humanity and to this country. Amen.
[1:38:51] That's my place. But they don't have
[1:38:53] any. And people love them so much to
[1:38:56] just leave them. You know, there just
[1:38:58] all hogwash. That's the devil's love.
[1:39:01] That's look friend. To me, that's not
[1:39:03] even felio love.
[1:39:06] Much less. That's barely a passive
[1:39:09] hatred for people to just leave them out
[1:39:11] like that. I I just don't understand
[1:39:14] that. But anyway, that's that's the
[1:39:16] people they don't know what their
[1:39:18] position is. When you as a Christian
[1:39:21] come to that place, to that epiphany,
[1:39:25] that revelation
[1:39:27] of what that placement is. I think
[1:39:30] brother Brandham came to that place. I
[1:39:31] know he did. Amen. Now, I may be
[1:39:34] misguided on what that might have been,
[1:39:37] but I I absolutely believe he did. But
[1:39:40] let's let's read. I had you turn to
[1:39:41] Ephesians.
[1:39:43] Let's read this.
[1:39:45] Ephesians 1.
[1:39:48] Maybe we'll get to the other. If we
[1:39:50] don't, we'll get to the the things that
[1:39:52] show what I just said to try to help
[1:39:55] prove that out a little bit. At least my
[1:39:57] opinion. Ephesians 1:1, Paul, an apostle
[1:40:01] of Jesus Christ by what? The will of
[1:40:04] God. Why? Because that's the only reason
[1:40:06] Paul was here. It's the only reason any
[1:40:09] of us should understand to believe that
[1:40:10] we're here is because we're here to do
[1:40:13] the will of God. To the saints which are
[1:40:16] at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:40:18] Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from
[1:40:20] God our father from the Lord Jesus
[1:40:22] Christ. Blessed be the God and father of
[1:40:25] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed.
[1:40:28] Now just because he said and doesn't
[1:40:30] mean there's a God and a father. Doesn't
[1:40:32] mean there's two people.
[1:40:34] Amen. But even trinitarians believe God
[1:40:37] was the father. But you look at the
[1:40:40] scripture, it says, "And does that make
[1:40:42] it two people?" Amen.
[1:40:46] If if if the truth is hid, I'm going to
[1:40:49] say this. It's a hard saying, but it's
[1:40:51] very true because it's scripture. If it
[1:40:53] is hid, it is hid to those that are
[1:40:55] lost.
[1:40:57] God help us. But look, blessed be the
[1:40:59] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:41:01] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:41:03] blessings in heavenly places in Christ,
[1:41:06] according as he hath chosen. And where
[1:41:08] do we heard that? Where did we hear that
[1:41:10] word before? Amen. We went back first
[1:41:13] Peter. Amen. Make sure you're calling an
[1:41:16] election. You're calling. You're
[1:41:18] choosing. Remember what election was?
[1:41:20] Choosing.
[1:41:21] Handpicking. God chose you. God
[1:41:24] handpicked you. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:27] specifically, purposely to do his will,
[1:41:30] to do whatever that purpose of will he
[1:41:32] has for you on this earth. He chose you
[1:41:35] for that. That's your election. Praise
[1:41:38] the Lord. So this chosen means election.
[1:41:40] God picked you. Chosen God. He has
[1:41:44] according as he hath chosen us in him.
[1:41:48] Elected us, chose us. And remember, if
[1:41:51] you stand in that election, you stand in
[1:41:54] that call, you can not fall.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Cannot fall. Period. If it's in God, you
[1:42:05] can not fall.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Now, if it's man-made
[1:42:10] or if it's somebody just doing what they
[1:42:11] think they want to do or what they're
[1:42:13] good at or something, it's it's all
[1:42:14] man-made, that'll fall.
[1:42:17] They can fall. But if it's in Christ, it
[1:42:20] can not fall. Praise the Lord. Chosen us
[1:42:24] in him before the foundation of the
[1:42:26] world that we should be holy and without
[1:42:28] blame before him in love.
[1:42:31] Having predestinated.
[1:42:34] Hallelujah. Predestin. I wonder how many
[1:42:36] churches actually even use the word
[1:42:38] predestinated anymore. such confusion,
[1:42:41] such misunderstanding, such lack of
[1:42:43] revelation of what predestination is
[1:42:48] that we should be holy without uh blame
[1:42:50] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:42:52] us unto unto the adoption. So, we're
[1:42:57] predestined to this position
[1:43:00] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:43:03] to himself. So, you see where we're
[1:43:05] adopted now. We're adopted by
[1:43:08] predestination
[1:43:11] to him
[1:43:13] according to his good pleasure.
[1:43:18] So our adoption and placement isn't for
[1:43:20] our pleasure. It isn't for our will.
[1:43:24] It's to do his will. It's for his good
[1:43:27] pleasure, not ours. So when we say when
[1:43:31] I say that I'm here for him, that's
[1:43:35] exactly what I mean.
[1:43:38] When we as Christians are here for him,
[1:43:41] that's exactly what we need. We're here
[1:43:44] according to his purpose. Praise the
[1:43:47] Lord. To do what he wants, not me, not
[1:43:50] us. Him. Praise the Lord. To by Jesus
[1:43:54] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:43:57] pleasure of his will. That was by
[1:43:59] predestination.
[1:44:01] Praise the Lord. to the praise of the
[1:44:03] glory of his grace wherein he had made
[1:44:05] us accepted in the beloved in whom we
[1:44:09] have redemption
[1:44:10] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:44:13] sins to the riches of his grace. Amen.
[1:44:17] By the blood. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:44:19] that precious blood brought redemption,
[1:44:23] wherein he hath provided toward us in
[1:44:25] all wisdom and prudence, having made
[1:44:28] known unto us the mystery of his will,
[1:44:31] according to his good pleasure, which he
[1:44:33] had purposed in himself. And how can we
[1:44:35] do it if he doesn't reveal it to us?
[1:44:39] It's no longer a mystery. If it were a
[1:44:41] mystery, how would we be able to fulfill
[1:44:44] it if we don't know what it is?
[1:44:47] So he's revealed it to us so that we
[1:44:49] know so that God's shown it and revealed
[1:44:52] it to us. Amen.
[1:44:55] The mystery of his will that in the
[1:44:57] dispensation
[1:44:58] of the fullness of time he might gather
[1:45:01] together in one all things in Christ
[1:45:04] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:45:05] in earth even in him in whom also we
[1:45:08] have obtained an inheritance. Praise the
[1:45:11] Lord.
[1:45:13] being predestinated according to the
[1:45:15] purpose of him who workketh all things
[1:45:18] after the counsel of his own will that
[1:45:21] we should be to the praise of his glory
[1:45:23] who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[1:45:26] also trusted after that ye heard the
[1:45:28] word of truth the gospel of your
[1:45:30] salvation in whom also after that ye
[1:45:32] believe you were sealed with the Holy
[1:45:34] Spirit of promise after you believe
[1:45:37] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:45:40] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:45:42] down payment until the redemption of the
[1:45:45] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:45:47] his glory which is adoption is all
[1:45:49] about. Amen. To with the redemption of
[1:45:53] our bodies.
[1:45:55] Praise God. That's what that's the
[1:45:58] placement. That's our that's what our
[1:46:00] placement is for. Praise the Lord. and
[1:46:02] have an inheritance that we become the
[1:46:06] individual to do his will to the praise
[1:46:10] of his glory because we have obtained
[1:46:13] that inheritance through predestination.
[1:46:16] Amen. Anybody have a different
[1:46:18] translation than the King James?
[1:46:22] Amen. I just wonder I I I I think I have
[1:46:24] made with one or two Bibles at home. I
[1:46:26] want to look and see if they even took
[1:46:28] the word predestination. Now, I bet you
[1:46:30] most of the I would venture to guess
[1:46:32] that most of the uh newer translations
[1:46:35] probably take out the word predestinated
[1:46:38] anyway, but in God's mind, predestinated
[1:46:44] to work all things after the counsel of
[1:46:46] his will. And he's put in us his spirit
[1:46:51] to be able to do that, to be able to
[1:46:53] live that, to be able to be that person.
[1:46:55] Now, let's go to one more. I think I'm
[1:46:57] going to I'll close after this. I won't
[1:46:59] get to the other I wanted to today, but
[1:47:01] we'll get to this. Hopefully, this will
[1:47:03] settle this for me, for you, for us. And
[1:47:07] the transformation.
[1:47:09] Amen. The transfiguring of recognizing,
[1:47:12] yes, Jesus had his transfiguration
[1:47:15] experience, but what about my
[1:47:17] transformation experience? What about my
[1:47:20] being transformed?
[1:47:24] Praise the Lord. do the will of God by
[1:47:26] his purpose, according to his purpose.
[1:47:29] Now, Romans 8,
[1:47:32] a very, very familiar scripture reading,
[1:47:34] verse 8 20 uh verse 28.
[1:47:38] Romans 8:28.
[1:47:41] And we know that all things work
[1:47:44] together for the good for good to them
[1:47:48] that love God. Now, that's the first
[1:47:50] thing.
[1:47:52] We know that he works all things
[1:47:55] together for our good because we love
[1:47:58] him. Amen. Not not a passing uh fancy,
[1:48:02] not a not some kind of a human love or
[1:48:06] some kind of an affinity for God, but a
[1:48:09] true agapeo love. If you see that word
[1:48:11] love
[1:48:13] in this scripture, it is agapeo. If you
[1:48:15] take that word love back to the Greek,
[1:48:18] that love in the scripture is agapo.
[1:48:21] It's God's love. It's unchanging love.
[1:48:25] Amen. Because we love God. It's the same
[1:48:28] love that Brother Brandon was speaking
[1:48:30] of when he said, "If God would sentence
[1:48:31] me to hell, I would still love him. If I
[1:48:34] go the way I am now, I would still love
[1:48:36] him even in hell." Why? Because even the
[1:48:39] circumstances of being in hell would not
[1:48:41] change his love for God. And if you've
[1:48:44] got that true agop love, it wouldn't
[1:48:46] change for any of us either. No matter
[1:48:48] what God does. So many people come along
[1:48:51] and they get hit with some kind of a a
[1:48:54] test or trial or something and first
[1:48:56] thing you know they're all say, "Why
[1:48:57] would God have let this happen? Why
[1:48:59] would God allow this to happen? What
[1:49:02] kind of a God would do this to people?"
[1:49:04] You hear that all the time. Said, "What
[1:49:06] kind of a God?" It probably happened
[1:49:08] even in these floods that just came.
[1:49:09] What kind of a God these people serve
[1:49:11] that would let that a god that would let
[1:49:14] them just be swept away like that?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sure I haven't heard any. I was
[1:49:18] working all week, so I didn't hear much
[1:49:20] news. But, uh, I'm sure there's people
[1:49:23] out there, especially all the uh, other
[1:49:25] different networks that are not really
[1:49:27] godly networks that are like, you know,
[1:49:30] what kind of a God these people serve
[1:49:31] and just, well, they they got what they
[1:49:33] I even heard one woman, they said one
[1:49:36] woman said they got what they deserved.
[1:49:40] I I just I I just fortunately the
[1:49:43] company that had employed that woman
[1:49:45] fired her
[1:49:47] and she was a pediatrician. I'm like who
[1:49:50] who would even say that? I mean what
[1:49:53] human being would say something like
[1:49:55] that?
[1:49:59] I I don't want to greater or less than a
[1:50:01] human because she's not less than a
[1:50:02] human. But that statement was less than
[1:50:05] human. Amen. But people do that. What
[1:50:08] kind of a God would do this? What you
[1:50:10] know? They leave. First thing they do,
[1:50:11] they leave God. They don't trust God.
[1:50:13] Don't believe God. Well, they never
[1:50:14] loved him to begin with.
[1:50:17] Amen. If you really love God, no matter
[1:50:19] what God puts you through, no matter
[1:50:20] what God's sending you to or what God
[1:50:22] calls you to or where God's sending you,
[1:50:24] you still love him with the same love
[1:50:26] that you've always loved him with. The
[1:50:28] love does not change.
[1:50:30] That love will cause God. He makes all
[1:50:33] things work together for our good
[1:50:35] because we love him like that. Amen.
[1:50:38] Because we love God to them. Look now to
[1:50:42] them who are the called according to his
[1:50:46] purpose. There we go again. Amen. Paul
[1:50:49] sure likes to make sure we understand it
[1:50:51] was for his purpose and not ours. Amen.
[1:50:56] Called. C called. C called. Election.
[1:50:59] Called. Chosen.
[1:51:01] God picked us
[1:51:04] for whom he did forno. Amen. which is
[1:51:07] the beginning of predestination if you
[1:51:09] will. For whom he did forno this is the
[1:51:12] 29th verse now for whom he did forno he
[1:51:16] also did predestinate so how did he
[1:51:18] predestinate by his fornowledge
[1:51:22] god didn't just come down arbitrarily
[1:51:24] and just laugh and say I'm going to make
[1:51:25] this person do this I'm going to make
[1:51:27] this person go do that no
[1:51:31] anyway by his fornowledge
[1:51:35] predestinated
[1:51:36] to be conformed conformed to the image.
[1:51:40] Now this conformed is not the same
[1:51:43] conformed as in uh Romans 12 when he
[1:51:46] said be not conformed to the world. That
[1:51:50] was a that was like a a scheme if you
[1:51:54] will if you go to look in the Greek was
[1:51:56] a scheme. But this conform is the same
[1:51:59] the same derivative
[1:52:02] same uh word as transformed.
[1:52:07] Transformed and conformed here are the
[1:52:10] same. So it's it's kind of mixed up when
[1:52:13] you look at the English language. But
[1:52:14] you got to understand he's saying two
[1:52:16] different when he says conformed here
[1:52:17] and he's saying conformed in the 12th
[1:52:19] chapter he's using two different words
[1:52:22] actually. One is a scheme and the other
[1:52:24] is a transforming. Amen. A renewing.
[1:52:28] Praise the Lord. Not esteemed uh uh by
[1:52:31] the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:33] He He did also did predestinate to be
[1:52:37] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:52:40] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:52:43] brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:52:46] predestinate
[1:52:47] them he also called. Sounds a lot like
[1:52:50] first Corinth of Ephesians chapter 1,
[1:52:52] doesn't it?
[1:52:54] The moreover, who he predestinated, he
[1:52:56] called. Whom he called, them he
[1:52:59] justified. Whom he justified, he's
[1:53:02] glored. To them, he also glorified. What
[1:53:05] shall we say to these things? If God be
[1:53:08] for us, who can be against us.
[1:53:11] Praise the Lord. You can never fall. If
[1:53:16] these things are true, your calling and
[1:53:19] election is sure, you can not fall. God
[1:53:23] makes everything. Let's tie first Peter
[1:53:26] and Romans 8 together. Now, he makes
[1:53:29] everything work together for your good.
[1:53:32] And if your calling and election is
[1:53:34] short, you can not fall.
[1:53:38] He has conformed you, transformed you,
[1:53:42] brought you in a transfigured
[1:53:45] uh uh transfiguration to bring you to
[1:53:47] the same place that God did Jesus there
[1:53:51] on that mountain.
[1:53:53] You've come, you come to that
[1:53:56] revelation. I'm not going to say
[1:53:57] epiphany anymore. Revelation.
[1:54:00] You've come to that revelation. Found
[1:54:02] your position in Christ. Amen. And and
[1:54:07] it's not based on age. It's not based on
[1:54:10] size. It's not based on your reent
[1:54:13] relevance in church. God can place
[1:54:17] Gabriel right now if he wants. That's up
[1:54:19] to God.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:23] age doesn't matter.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; That that's that's up to the Lord. Amen.
[1:54:28] And where he brings each of us along.
[1:54:31] But he makes everything work together
[1:54:32] for our good. Our calling and election
[1:54:34] is sure. We cannot fall. Amen. We're in
[1:54:38] the place that God has called us,
[1:54:40] predestinated us, conformed us, uh
[1:54:43] elected us, chosen us. I don't what
[1:54:46] other adjectives do we need to to
[1:54:49] describe to understand who we are in
[1:54:51] Christ
[1:54:53] and our position in him.
[1:54:57] Praise the Lord. It just comes just as
[1:55:01] God just as God delivers it, just as God
[1:55:04] brings it. And come to that
[1:55:06] understanding, come to that revelation.
[1:55:09] Amen. God has called me. God has
[1:55:12] positioned me. God has placed me. God,
[1:55:15] God has a purpose for me. We talked
[1:55:17] about the little wa wash woman. Amen.
[1:55:20] That woman will get credit on the other
[1:55:22] side for those half a million souls that
[1:55:24] Dwight movie led to Christ. She'll get
[1:55:26] credit for him because she was the one
[1:55:28] that did something
[1:55:30] and and who knows what else. Probably
[1:55:33] nothing else happened to that lady
[1:55:36] in her life. You'd think significant
[1:55:38] like that. But we are here to fulfill
[1:55:41] our position, our placement, what God's
[1:55:44] put us. What is our position in Christ?
[1:55:46] I think it's as paramount more now than
[1:55:49] has ever been. That we recognize
[1:55:52] where God has placed us. Amen. Praise
[1:55:56] the Lord. In this life, in in in his
[1:55:58] body. Amen. That we can never fall. God
[1:56:02] will make everything work together for
[1:56:04] our good because we love him. Amen. We
[1:56:08] love him. He loves us and his love for
[1:56:12] us is unconditional. Amen. The only
[1:56:15] reason our love could be unconditional
[1:56:17] for him is because he started it.
[1:56:20] He started it. It was him that started
[1:56:22] this. His love for us has always been
[1:56:25] unconditional. We come to a revelation
[1:56:27] one day that our love and and our
[1:56:30] position in him is I love him
[1:56:32] regardless. Amen.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we
[1:56:36] could.
[1:56:42] I was hoping to get to this other part,
[1:56:43] but I that's that was the main of what I
[1:56:46] wanted to say
[1:56:51] and bring forth today as God would show
[1:56:53] it to us. Amen. Because it's him that
[1:56:57] does it. It's him that brings us to this
[1:56:59] place. And we are so close, friend. I
[1:57:02] believe we are so very close to the
[1:57:04] coming of the Lord. We are so very close
[1:57:07] to seeing our loved ones appear before
[1:57:08] us. We're so very close to a
[1:57:10] transformation, to a a a rapture, a
[1:57:14] changing of the body. Amen. A going to
[1:57:18] the air to meet him.
[1:57:22] This bride is going to be in her place.
[1:57:26] Amen. It's like we said before, God is
[1:57:29] not coming for a deformed body. He's
[1:57:31] coming for a complete mature woman.
[1:57:34] Amen. She's not going to be missing a
[1:57:36] leg. an arm, foot, an ear, an eye. She's
[1:57:40] going to be complete and each part in
[1:57:43] its place, in its position, playing its
[1:57:46] part. Praise the Lord. And even if you
[1:57:49] have to be the bottom of uh what is it,
[1:57:52] Brother Null said, the the skin on the
[1:57:54] bottom of your foot. Amen. You're still
[1:57:57] a part of the body. Praise the Lord. I'm
[1:58:00] so thankful for that. Amen. Let's sing
[1:58:03] that. Uh we'll just sing the chorus
[1:58:06] portion of it. I'm so glad I'm a part of
[1:58:08] the family of God.
[1:58:10] Amen.
[1:58:13] Shall we turn?
[1:58:16] Is it on there or should I should we get
[1:58:18] our books out?
[1:58:24] Amen.
[1:58:27] So glad to be a part of the family of
[1:58:28] God. Aren't you?
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this just the chorus part.
[1:58:32] We'll sing. We will sing the verses. I'm
[1:58:35] so glad to be a part of the family of
[1:58:37] God. Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so glad I'm a part
[1:58:44] of the family of God.
