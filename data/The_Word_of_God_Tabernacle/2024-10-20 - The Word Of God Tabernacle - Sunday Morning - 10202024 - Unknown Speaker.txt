stay away from the house of God to make excuses for not paying our tithes to um make excuses to not fellowship with Believers and and to associate with worldly people they'll drain every uh uh spirit of your Holy Spirit out of our Lives oh Father it's time to put on the whole armor of God lord to walk in the in your word in your truth Thy word is a lamp to my feet a light into my pathway yes Lord

but they certainly still need our prayers uh I did want to also mention and remember the geta family uh as I had wrote in the text I found out brother Aaron called me uh on the job last week and informed me that his father had passed away uh so please remember that family in prayer I know for a fact we were very close together family for many years uh for a fact that uh that family leaned extremely extremely heavily on brother Larry uh they they had brother Aaron the girls had such extreme respect for brother Larry um and they're going to miss him tremendously so please remember them in prayer if you would um they're going to have a private family uh a gravide for brother Larry um he didn't tell me when or where which is okay I understand uh but they're going to have a memorial service for him in November thinking early November no details yet but brother Aaron is supposed to inform me when those details become more uh solid in firm so when I do know that I will let you know uh so that you can decide if you'd like to go and attend I'm assuming of course it'll be at the Tucson Tabernacle um so um but in the meantime please remember that family Inay of course sister meline

Time by a woman uh broke his ankle and threw him up and there and uh him and mine were they were younger then it was probably 20 years ago they were they were taking care of each other then uh kind of but uh she's there I don't know I'm sure there's going to be a lot of decisions to be made by the family uh with her in the situation I don't know I I don't even want to speculate her ability to live on her own but please remember them in prayer um the Lord knows all yes and there's a reason for everything so uh we just trust the Lord that God's going to move and uh move on the scene for that

all of a sudden a police car came zooming past with his lights on on and no siren I slammed on my brakes just in time praise the Lord God helping in preventing another possible catastrophe amen praise the Lord Jesus so thankful that he's ever present with us amen praise the Lord thank God for that amen oh sure go ahead sister um I you all know the difficulties I've had and um I it was around January or February um I was sitting on my couch and it was late at night and I the presence of the Lord came over me and caused a shift and it was like the old had been pushed out and the new had been brought in a picture and a feeling and experience that I've never had before and it was with me I haven't quite known how to walk in it though and a song came to me a couple weeks ago this is the air I breathe your holy presence living in and last night I heard Kim CL speaking about our breath our breath is um the word of God and and it's our future um the past is gone the present is is being shot up as we live and but the future is the very Breath of God and that's what God was showing me back in February or something and I realized all that I've been living on Grief my and overpowered me last night and showed me that the direction that I was heading was right and that I've been proclaiming and prophesying over my children you are saved you are you know this situation is like this and just prophesying God's word over my life that is the Breath of God he just made me realize you know fully what well fully I say fully know fully but you know this is this is the air I breathe and this is where my happiness is by living in the future and I and a join has just started to I'm not completely there yet but the joy of the Lord is starting to just roll in and I just want to share that with you and I I had gave that song to you last week the I breathe been kind of working on me amen pise the Lord God is good amen praise the Lord do gives to us what we need when we need it amen let's stand to our feet if we could Let's uh go to the scripture now St John chapter uh 14 amen something I felt to speak on I try to Lord help U try to have a a message on faith every so often and hopefully a message on the Holy Spirit the things that consider um the more important issues that we face every day having faith so easy for our faith to diminish or amen our faith of the world to take a hit yes with all the things of the world but amen it's always good to understand that faith is what we live by yes without faith it is impossible to please the Lord so amen so St John chapter 14 want to read a couple of vers of scripture from here but before we do can we just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're very thankful again father this place this time Lord this service that you've given us God feeling your presence and knowing that you're real God knowing that you're the same yesterday today and forever knowing that you know what to tell us when to tell us and how to tell us and bring us into you Lord God in that special way in that special relationship every one of us need to have God we have to have it is our Lifeline father that relationship with you is everything to us Lord you can take all the whole world but give me Jesus because you are our portion Lord you are our everything and today God we just give a little Port of it back God to you and expecting you to meet with us in this service but Lord as our worship goes before you Lord now as we open the pages of this book lord and God you speak to us from your word may our worship go up to you today God as you continue to fill us and to bless and to strengthen us God let us give that just even if it's just a little portion of what we can do back to you God with the fruit of our lips thank you Lord for God blessing us with health and strength and life in our bodies and just trusting and praying you move upon every request every need that was made known today Father everyone that's in our hearts Lord every unspoken request Lord we just trust and believe that you are faithful that you knew them before they ever became request God and the fact that the desire of our hearts Lord calling out to you Lord that's in us that God that with something that's important that we would like to make known God and and to bring before the congregation and expect you Lord as it has been verbalized to move upon every one of them Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filter this place in any way of this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done let it be done here now according to your perfect will what you have predestined before the foundation of the world for this service to accomplish Let It Be bless those that are here those who may be streaming those who may archive it Lord we just commit ourselves to you and ask His blessings Lord in the precious holy and lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen St John chapter 14 couple of verses of scripture beginning with the 12th verse John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it yes praise the Lord amen you could be SE it you'd like ask anything Amen in my name right I will do it now do we believe that or not amen amen it's like the beginning of the service it's like the beginning of when we when we started and recognizing God's already paid for it all God's already done the work we just have to be able to be willing to believe it and step into it yes Amen to live it to let God live through us to let the the blessings that God has given us live through us we just got to be able to understand that faith that we have in God and in his word he said believe uh uh verely verily he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also how many of you have read this Bible you don't have to raise your hand but how many of you have read this Bible how many of you have read St John how many you have read this scripture how many have ever heard this scripture read how many have ever heard this scripture preached on and how many of us still in some way just don't be able to to grasp it like we should believe me for the very for verely if you believe me the works that I do so if you've read this if you've heard it if you've heard it read if you've heard it preach if you know the scripture you know the works he's done he told us that we would do the same works as he did if we believe on him amen now he said but then he went on to say and Greater Works and brother brandham talked about well Jesus raised the dead and how could you do something greater than raising of the dead but brother brandham said when he's referring to this what he's talking about is more Works amen nothing necessarily greater in stature to say to raise somebody from the dead because someone who is lifeless giving them life is the epitome of what we could offer someone spiritually or physically more so spiritually but the epitome of what you could do for someone now but he talked that greater more amen a larger amount of these Works shall we do yes this falls on us for us for us to do it amen for us to do the works the Greater Works than what he than than what the scripture says what he did more shall we do now let's go over to First John we see uh some of the difficulties that people have because it said if you believe in me believe have faith amen have faith Bel confidence which this the message today is is to have confidence H having confidence in the Lord amen amen first John now every one of us we always hold the different ones in different esteem as we would brother brandham uh basically it's it's uh it's kind of like a a respect Factor uh that that we should have just just as we have in our Natural Life uh there's respect factors that we should have in our natural life when we're born uh we there should be a natural respect for our parents now some people may have been born in homes whose parents are horrible parents but there should still be a respect factor of recognizing that your mom she brought you in this world that's your dad amen or your mother or your father how it may be there's some fathers that aren't dads but you that's a whole another subject but a certain respect Factor when you start going to school amen you may have the worst teacher that ever God ever was ever put on this planet but you should be a respect Factor Amen to that to that individual that person holds an office over you to teach you yes Amen to try to help bring you to a place of a greater understanding amen as you go grow older and you get a job there should be a certain respect factor that you have you may have again I I keep saying this but you may have the worst boss that there's ever been on the planet Earth all throughout Humanity Humanity you got the worst boss but there should still be a respect Factor there that you have for that person for that boss for that person who is over you amen not that uh you agree with everything in fact uh it may come to a point that you can no longer be under that that person but while you're there there should still be that respect Factor even in in in in in in in government amen uh uh I'm not a fan of certain governments I'm not a fan of certain uh people in offices I'm not a fan of certain uh individuals that run the country um but there should still be a respect Factor amen a respect Factor not NE May uh the I I say this with all due respect uh this may be the worst president ever in the history of the country but I say may I'm not saying he is I'm just saying uh hypothetically he could be just like your boss may have been the worst boss just like your teacher may have been the worst teacher um may have been the worst in history of the of the country but there still should be a certain respect factor for that office amen if you go in the military there should be a certain respect factor that you have in in fact if you uh uh if you don't have that respect factor in the military uh it'll not end well for you let's put it that way um but there should still be that respect factor and that's what we have not that we hold Sate brother brandom in in a different uh esteem but there's a respect factor for that office amen there should be a respect factor to understand that God put him in that place at that time and and and for that reason and that should always be there it should be be there in in in every spect of life in aspect of life and the respect factors may be at a different level amen my my wife is not over me but I have a respect for my wife as my wife amen and and vice versa that's to me that's why a lot of relationships break down because there's there is not that respect Factor there amen she has her wiely place have my husbandly place and we respect each other in that we cohabitate and live together love each other and uh and and under God but there that respect got to be there amen it's got to be there and that's what we don't worship brother bradam but we have a respect amen a respect for that office we have and and that's what gives us that confidence that's what helps us have confidence to recognize that uh uh that what we believe that the Lord work through him uh not worldly sense now we're speaking spiritually now they just typing that together but now spiritually uh we have that confidence in brother brandom to recognize the proves that we saw and heard uh may have been on tape may it been on video may have been by testimonies uh May It Be by just Revelation that God give to us but that brings a certain respect factor a certain confidence to recognize that what uh that that what he did what he said we believe came from God yes we believe was the hand of God and that's a confidence that we have not that we put brother brandom on some pedestal somewhere uh it it would it would well he when people worshiped him he quit the ministry he just left field I mean he said I I won't have people doing that but then God rebuked him and said well but you got to keep going forward for those that need you for those that don't worship you for there there's going to be those things the carnal impersonation is always going to be there amen but so we don't do but we have that respect that confidence amen that we have has to be uh has to be there if you don't have confidence in it it can't help you uh if you don't have confidence in me I can't help you if you don't have confidence in this word it can't help you if you don't have confidence in in in the prophet and the words from the word that he brought he it can't help you amen you've got to have that confidence the scripture we just read the Greater Works so you do if you don't have confidence in that it can't help you right Amen brother random said it's not for the unbeliever yes it's not for the person who is not going to believe it because if you don't believe it it won't work and if it won't work you can't have confidence in it amen you've got to have faith in knowing what you're saying and what you're doing you've got to have faith in confidence in what this word says yes and what this word tells you and that confidence is what brings the results that faith is what brings the results that we can believe amen now first John I had you turn chapter 3 1 John chapter 3 amen 1 John chapter 3 let's just start with U let's just start with verse 16 first John not St John 1 John chapter 3 uh start with verse 16 hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren now you got to have confidence in to be able to do that am but who so hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him right my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth amen and hereby we know that we that uh we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts assure our hearts before him what does that mean assure our hearts having confidence amen we sure up we we we uh gird up our hearts amen before him knowing that it's the truth see believe faith for for if our heart condemns us condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things so so many times this this is the weapon I've spoke on this many times but this is the weapon that the devil uses the greatest condemnation to try to condemn you continuously condemn you all the time maybe even for things that he just imagined that you thought or said or did amen maybe not even something you did but that's not the point yes if you have confidence in Christ if you have confidence in his blood if you have confidence in your repentance and Faith then there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen there's conviction when you may do something wrong or go down the wrong path or some sort of iniquity of doing something you shouldn't or not doing something you should there's a conviction that the Holy Ghost will give you to say you don't do that you don't act like that you belong to me you are a Christian amen you're a Christian conduct yourself like one amen amen there's a conviction that comes but a condemnation but what conviction does is it's there to lift you up it's there to encourage you right it's it's there to say you are better than that it's there to say you are a a closer to me you are a you are a Christian you are part of the family of God you don't act like that conviction is to lift up is to build up is to help grow a person but condemnation is to tear you down right condemnation is to condemn you so that you feel less than who you really are amen and that's what the devil does yes the the devil condemns you to the point you say well I've done something wrong I made a mistake or said something thought something whatever it was I made a mistake okay we're all human we're all Sinners saved by the grace of God we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God amen amen we agree on that that's what the Bible says we all have so you make a mistake you've made a mistake you've fallen short you've done something you shouldn't or whatever then the devil's going to try to come and condemn you and tear you down to make you believe that you're not a Christian to make you try to believe that you're not who God says that you are who you know in your heart you are to tear you down to to to break you away from the family of God why so you can't have faith if he can tear you down enough you won't you will lose your confidence you will lose your faith and if you lose that friend you have nothing nothing if we lose our faith in God if we lose our faith in God's word if we lose our faith in who we know we are as children of God then then then the devil's got to hold on you and that's what condemn is for see and that's why it says if our heart condemns us why would the why would your heart condemn you because the devil has brought something up or even something even in the past not even something that you recently done or made a mistake sake or whatever just in the past and digging it up again cuz you know that sh that that devil has a big old shovel right amen and right on the and right on the front of the shovel it says condemnation amen and then he goes and he starts digging for one purpose and that is to condemn you that's to try to tear you down to try to cause you to lose faith in who God is and who you are in him to try to lose confidence and Faith to believe that this world is true to bring the edification and the growth into your life that's what his purpose is condemnation so if it says our heart condemn us what does that mean well that means that the devil's done something to condemn you amen or or maybe you made a mistake and it's condemned your heart you but but see it it can't be condemned because God condemned it it's if your heart's condemned it's because the devil's condemned you right to tear you down to rip you apart and you say well I actually did make this mistake well then let's read on because there's a remedy for that too amen if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and he knoweth all things God knew it anyway God knew you were going to do it before you did it God knew you were going to say it before you said it God knew you were going to think it before you even thought it he knows all things so God is greater than that condemnation God is greater than our heart God is greater than any of those mistakes or faults failures shortcomings you've ever made God is greater than that in your heart amen and he has made the way so that we can overcome to believe that by the blood of Jesus Christ whatever that thing is the devil in his condemnation shovel is dug up is under the blood of Christ and it can never be remembered against me again everen you say well I make another another mistake so he just brings this one back up and compiles it with that one no no no no when it's under the blood Saints it is gone right out of God's Remembrance in your book period never to be remembered again even if five minutes later you make another mistake that first one's gone right he doesn't just bring that one up and bring them together no never ever to be remembered again ever you got to believe that yes why because that causes your heart not to be condemned so when the devil takes out his big old fat ugly shovel and is of condemnation and starts digging up you can say devil that's on your head not mine right that God put that under the blood that that that's doesn't accounted to me anymore amen amen my book my book says that I am free go find that in my book of life go find it it's not there right why because it's been annihilated by the blood of Christ amen those who are born of God canot sin rightall if you are born of God you have the Holy Ghost you cannot sin your name has moved from The Book of Life to the Lamb's Book of Life which is always predestinated there anyway to the Lamb's Book of Life and there's not one crooked wrong bad thing in that book cuz that's the Lamb's Book of Life right that's where your spiritual birth is that's where your spiritual life is all this other stuff doesn't matter amen yeah there's conviction yeah we we we we should live as Christians and conduct ourselves as Christians but when we make a mistake or fall the little stickiness of our flesh or something don't let the devil come and condemn your heart you say God for forgive me remember that story brother Bram told Brother green told us about that time he went to Brother Bram when they were on the hunting trip and he told Brother green uh brother Ram he said brother Ram I want to talk to you about something he says I know brother Perry he said just hold on to it we'll get to it later oh I know I know we'll talk about it later he's laying on the couch and brother green brother brother R sitting there on the couch with his feet across laying I forgot how it was anyway M been sitting up with his feet across and brother brother green comes into the brother Braham says okay now about your problem did you I can't imagine what it was like in that situation come sit down here sit down on the couch come sit at the foot on the couch there by his feet he said now about your problem and now the brother Bram knew and of course he told him all and confessed all I don't need to go into all that stuff again lustful imaginations and stuff and brother brah says you got to do like I do what you you you know what I'm talking about right I know exactly what you're talking about I'm a red-blooded male too the Devil comes to me too amen he comes to you too it comes to me too he comes to brother he came to brother brand too probably even more so amen comes to uh uh and I can say this because I'm it's my family uh he comes after us and PKS as much as in more than anybody ask my son right ask my daughter at PK's preacher kids uh more than anybody amen uh we've lived it friends people look say Well it comes at us pretty hard we' lived it um I mean if if if it's anything he can do to try to uh destroy us is to start at the right amen you know Israel's having a victory this week because they did what they cut off the head of the snake that come against him AUST October 7th last year they killed uh whatever I forget his name now uh the leader of Hamas they killed the guy The Mastermind behind uh the attack of October 7th last year on his PE on the people of Israel they killed him amen so now they're happy cuz what do they do if you can kill the head then you can you can kind of try to uh make the rest go and disarray right it's like the prophecy of Micah Micah's remember Micah's prophecy against Ahab he says you can go on a head up there but I see Israelite sheep having no shepher scattered all over the place right why because you if you get rid of the head then what happens and the body underneath it just kind of scatters and goes about and is disorganized dysfunctional and can't organize itself well that's exactly what the devil tries to do he come out against brother Brown so hard and uh the the the the ones that are in position he tries to destroy them amen if he can't destroy them he tries to destroy them through their families uh through their children he does everything he can he's ruthless devil yes amen right but he says now about your problem you got to do the same thing that I do amen he's a man great brother brand was a man praise the Lord Jesus Christ was a man right amen of course he lived without fault he was sinless amen but brother Brown was a sinner saved by the grace of God yes he was just a man uh how many times brother green tell us let him be a man I I I probably fight a allar for every time brother green said let let him be a man yeah that that's very important to understand he was a man he said now want you you got to do the same thing I do he said now when you get to this situation and it happens that's why brother brandom hung a cross in his car right amen so something that he shouldn't be looking at he looked to the Cross why he's in the car look to the cross I remember that time brother green he talked about downtown Tucson said beautiful looking Mexican woman come and walked across the street said brother Brown followed her all the way across the road and he stopped and come said now see brother Barry that's that's what we've got to guard ourselves against and put a cross this car look to the Cross amen now you got to do the same thing I do what when you come to yourself right and you realize I'm not like that I'm not that kind of person I don't do those things I don't say those things I don't act like that maybe you need to go apologize to somebody whatever the situation is you see I'm not like that he said as soon as you can get a hold of yourself right he say God forgive me I'm sorry I I didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to say that or act that way or think that or whatever it was Lord forgive me I didn't mean to be that way and you know what that instant gone that millisecond is gone under the blood of Christ never to be remembered against you ever again and the devil tries to bring it up that's his problem not mine that's right but your problem becomes when if he digs it up and you entertain it right that's when the problem comes yeah don't entertain it devil that is under the blood don't you dare try to bring that back to me he'll use other people trying to bring it back up to you too amen other people you think oh this is a brother or sister and they'll come and try to bring that stuff up back said he'll try to use look he'll try to use vessels if he can to try to dig those things up to throw them back in your face you know what you do you say brother sister I love you but that is under the blood it has you have it has no business coming across your lips it has no business even talking about thinking about it's done it's over it's under the blood and I am free from it amen praise God yes I make that mistake 10 minutes later same thing yes I mean I know that sounds extreme that you know make the mistake 10 minutes later after you just but that that's the truth nevertheless right make that mistake 10 minutes later same thing come to yourself God forgive me amen now it's got to be sincere it can't be just something that people just like Catholics do and say they can just live however they want and say you know forgive me and you know hell mares and pentant whatever it is it's not that it's not just say well I can live however I want because I know God's going to forgive me no it doesn't work that way amen it doesn't work that way but if you're sincere you're real and in your heart and you want to live and you're living the best you you know how and the life that God's give you and you're you're growing in Grace the Lord is helping you and you're coming along and in your heart you sincerely God I don't want I did not want to do that I do not want to be like that God it's forgiven right it's forgotten it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again amen praise the Lord you know where it goes It goes back on the head of Satan lays there till the day of judgment hallelujah praise the Lord say well God forgets it God can't forget anything simp I said God doesn't forget anything no but he doesn't remember against you right he doesn't remember it against you where is it it's on the head of the devil that's where it is and you know what the white Throne judgment who's going to be responsible for every bit of it right the devil that's right amen not you the devil praise so if your heart condemns you God is greater in our hearts he knows all things he knew you'd fall in that trap he knew you'd make that mistake he knew you'd say that he you God knows amen even if you fall even if the devil tempts you a h hundred times you fall one out of a 100 doesn't matter he knows yes God knows and our heart condemns us then God is greater than our heart amen so the point of it is don't let your heart be condemned because when your heart becomes condemned you lose confidence that's you lose faith and when you lose that faith and confidence you're lost period let's continue on beloved now other side of the coin beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards God praise the Lord I want to tell you there's not been a human walk this planet amen outside of the Divine Jesus Christ that has not fallen into this situation right every one of us amen but knowing that if our heart condemn us so what do we do that thing goes away repent it's under the blood it's gone don't let your heart be condemned cuz when your heart condemns you not amen I I I I I've I've lived a holy life amen I've I've uh done the wrong to shun the right amen then I know that my heart does not condemn me I've repented I've made the mistakes things I've made them right they're under the blood no matter what anybody says no matter what the devil says it's under the blood it's gone it's over don't let the devil condemn you with that and if your heart doesn't condemn you that should be a Perpetual 247 for every one of us a non condemned heart then we can have confidence towards God faith in God and when that confidence is there when that faith is there then there's not one thing that can come to you that God want that you by faith believe speak that will happen amen it will the Greater Works will happen if your heart does not condemn you ask anything in his name and he will do it why because your heart is not condemned amen you have the confidence you have the faith you believe that's the thing that changes the whole situation is Faith is having that confidence and belief God is going to do it it is done actually it is a finished work amen amen how long has it been now I keep I don't keep I'm going to keep testifying to this how long has it been now since brother Dennis brother and my little grandson come and put his hands on my needs by inspiration of God now I felt him that morning to come how many how many weeks is that how many months has that been yeah amen amen but every day every week they get better and better amen amen every week every day and I hadn't been to physical therapy in months amen I try to do some exercise I still try to do the exercises at home and stuff but uh I I worked a lot of this week with no pain in my knees by the grace of God I told one of the guys that I said man I never realized how fun it was to not have pain yeah to not I was in so much pain I can't even imag I can't even describe it how I I mean I was in such pain especially after the right one went and I was I would just stand there like this and my team knows I'm not like that right my my manager came out and he said are you all right I said I am just in so much pain I I and God help me but I took like ibuprofin for four uh uh acetaminophen Tylenol I I just and nothing helped nothing I just I was so excruciating pain for so long and then my feet started throbbing even sitting down even when I sat down to take pressure off my feet they would just it would just be like my heart beating in my it was just such but the Lord amen but God has taken over the seen and healed and and they're still they're not they're not they're not 100% amen but every day every week they're better and better all the time amen because God the confidence I believe brother Dennis laid hands on me I I believe even Joel I believe he in his little innocent faith beli that God was going to heal me yes amen and I believed it because I believe it was the testimony you showed me that morning I told you everyone after y'all prayed for me how there was like I had he pads on both knees yes and it just gets better and better all the time amen it wasn't a miraculous thing that bam and they're perfect no but every the healing was there and it continues on and see that's another thing that the devil uses to try to Rob our confidence we we so get in in in encompassed in dwelling on the Miracle the instantaneous the right now the uh the the the the immediate healing or change that that we don't realize see even in other people uh in in our lives some are we're all different there's there's an immediate change in all of our Lives when we get saved when we get born again there's immediate change but we're still growing friend we're just babies not even crawling yet right and people look and say will you call yourself Christian yeah but the give the person a chance let them grow let the Lord continue to work with them maybe they just continue to make mistakes or or do things just let the Lord speak to them let the ministry speak to them let the word go forth and and change and and as and as people continue to grow let them continue to grow amen when they grow into the Lord and we come up into the statue of a perfect man into the place that God uh can use that person more and more all the time uh we lose our faith in healing if it's not a miracle I think well it must not to happened yeah I felt the warmth on my knees friend but when I went to work the next week I was in pain I was in a lot of pain but I knew God had healed me yes I knew I had been healed I just in my in my life and now what months later it's taken that and it's like you just got to have faith just believe right just have confidence amen it's like brother random said you can have faith he he even had people come up on the platform and he pray for them and they'd get healed and and and then they go off and something happened and they disbelieve right amen come back and say you know but it's back but I prayed for you God healed you but it's bad it's because you you you doubt it don't doubt you can't doubt have no doubt right and if it and that's what the lord the devil uses sometime to condemn us with yeah it doesn't happen instantaneously so we think oh well I guess it wasn't for me I guess God's not going to heal me I guess it this wasn't uh uh and and you lose faith in the word you lose faith in God you lose confidence in in in what his word says and then and and sure as the world then you're not going to get healed right it you're it's not going to happen yeah amen got to cont continue to hold that Faith 22nd verse whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight amen praise the Lord this is the Commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another yes praise the Lord remember as we we went through this the other day Faith operates by love amen what did the angel of the Lord tell brother Brown when he when he commissioned him to go out anybody remember anybody can say that remember what the angel of the Lord told him amen he said get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray and nothing will stand before your prayer amen what does that Encompass that encompasses Genesis Genesis Galatians 5 it encompasses faith and love amen if you can get the people to believe you Faith you get the people to believe have faith be sincere what is sincerity is love it's an affection charity love you get the people to believe and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer yes amen ask whatever you will in my name and I will give it what else can God do it's like we said at the beginning of the service if if someone went and bought you your favorite food at your favorite restaurant and paid the bill in full and it was a $1,000 meal and it was paid in full all you had to go do is was eat it would you stay at home and say I don't want that but you I I I I don't want to n I'm good without it it's your favorite thing it's your favorite place it's paid in full why would you not take advantage of that and again if the person who paid for it and you didn't take it I would be insulted I would be insulted if I thought enough of you to do this this for you and you're like ah no forget it I'm not going to I'm not I don't I don't want to go eat I'm I'm not going to do that your favorite food it's your favorite place and you won't go eat it or anything God feels when he's done it all he's paid it all and we won't partake of it we won't engage in it and take what God's he wants us to the whole point he wants you to more than you want to yeah you think how badly I want to be healed or or whatever it is or my family to be saved or something they go how much God wants that amen more than you want it yeah that's hard to Fathom amen because when I think in life I think about the salvation of my family is uh is the most important thing I know of right I I I I would if I on half this world I would give it for that if I on half this galaxy I would give it for that if I don't have this universe I would give it for that purpose for that reason right there's nothing I wouldn't do or pay for that and God's already done it right amen amen all you got to do is go get it walk through the door I'm so so oh hello we've been expecting you here's your special table here's your special meal your bill is paid in full eat till you're feel amen that's that's a very carnal analogy of what God has done for us a heart can't condemn us get the people to believe and be sincere when you pray this is the Commandment 23rd verse that we should believe believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another believe faith and love it's the same thing wow that's just God doesn't change so while his word doesn't change as he gave us commandment and he that keepeth this commandment dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in Us by the spirit which he G which he hath given us amen let me read something here cuz I got a couple scriptures I want to go to um well if I can find it identified Christ of all ages look what brother Bram said he said he knew knew before the world began remember he knows all things just read that he knew before the world began that we would sit here he knew how many times I'd raised my hands up and down he knew the words that I'd say he knew how many times you'd bat your eyes what you would think before the world ever started what you would think amen so nothing can can surprise him what you would think before the world ever started what are we afraid about God is our father that's right he's our father we have no worry people's just lost their faith and confidence in him oh my help us Lord you say well I've lost it myself where did that come from amen think about it look away to Jesus brother B's talking about um his wife here remember when she uh kitties have been crying and carrying on and she was frazzled and at her wits end and she slammed the door I won't go through all the store but she slammed the door in his face said you take care of then and he brother br's like oh poor thing she's had it rough and you know it's been hard and she has to be here so many times by herself and raising the kids God help her but the Lord spoke to brother brand and said she shouldn't have done that amen she displeased the Lord she displeased that angel amen and remember then that tumor came on her it was years later but then that tumor came on her and there was the brother B said Look Away to Jesus he said now let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Lord Jesus I have seen it I have seen it upon other people but when it come to my own precious wife it was in my home then Lord I looked at it with my own eyes felt it with my own hands 16 it was 16 years 16 years before that uh it was also Lord known and revealed by you because the Lord told me amen he didn't tell brother B exactly what was going to happen or what it was going to be but he told her that he told Brother God told him it was going to happen when anything is spoken it must be done you were showing me Lord then that my confidence in what you had done for the people and would let me know so I could help them amen think about that that I could help them what was in his own house the lesson now it wasn't just because of what she had done that was part of it it displeased the Lord but what God was working on and working was to bring it to a place maybe if I could say can't put myself in his position but enhancement of that sincerity be sincere when you pray you can't I can't even begin to imagine what it was like to be in places and being mocked at and laughed at made fun of and and and all that brother Bram had to endure and the carnal impersonations and stuff and uh the difficulty uh in his stature and who he was and the life he lived God was always bringing things to and adversity like this tumor in his wife to bring it to the place that came in his own home like he said but to bring him to a place of of prayer and sincerity so that he could do that to help the people my that that's when you talk about living your life for others saints that yes amen of course then the Lord Brother BR was down praying for it right before she was about to have surgery and and the Lord says stand on your feet you speak what is going to happen and what you say will happen brother B said before the doctor's hand can touch it it'll be gone amen amen she laid there the doctor pulled back the sheet as he went to put his hand on that grapefruit thing gone yes ameno praise the Lord yes that that's the truth sinten praise God look let's go to this scripture I I've got a couple more but I just want to I want to go to this specifically it's in 1 Samuel we all know the story amen thank you Jesus stand on your feet and speak it yes amen we do a lot of pray and Saints but sometimes it comes time to stand on your feet speak it amen yes 1 Samuel chapter 17 verse 31 1st Samuel 17:31 and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before Saul and he sent for him of course this is Goliath and Goliath cursing God Amen David said how can the head of that that uncircumcised Philistine still be on him anyway David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth doesn't matter because little as much as God is in right yes God could have used a mosquito to cut the head off of Goliath if he wanted to yes he could have used the amoeba off a NP to cut the head off Goliath if he wanted to amen amen right doesn't matter this little man David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him praise God IM how many people amen when that line came after me I grabbed him by the beard and I just killed him that is unheard of friend yes I just grabbed him by the beard and just killed him a lion and a bear the thy servant thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philis shall be as one of them seeing how he had defied the armies of the Living God God had worked on David in perilous situations to have a lion come and a bear come to take his possession away to take the thing that he was responsible for away from him to take his livelihood to take that that he was responsible for away from him and he said when that lion came I went and I chased down that lion and I took that lamb right out of his mouth and I grabbed him by the beer and I beard and I killed him praise the Lord God working on David God showing David I am with you when the bear came did the same thing he took that bear and he took his his lamb back out of his mouth and he killed him he said now this un circumcised Philistine will be as one of them what was God doing with David he was helping David's confidence he was helping David's Faith to realize I'm with you amen there's nothing that I won't do for you whatever you ask in my name I will give it to you praise the Lord think about it Saints whatever you ask I will give it to you yes he said as this lion was and as this bear was so will that in circumcised Philistine be amen he will fall before me this day praise God Saul tried to give him his armor and it wouldn't even fit him amen right oh praise the Lord all that ecclesiastical stuff doesn't fit but Faith does Amen confidence does Amen so when he come to the real Showdown with him in Goliath he could take that Giant's head off because God had already been with him could you imagine what brother R all the confidence things like the the tumor that that God did with brother Rand think about those things that he does with us how many times has God proved over and over and over and over in your life even in adverse situations God takes those things to make them work out for your good amen how many times is that help us to recognize that God is with us amen that we have faith that God is going to do for us it isn't God did it then is he going to do it now no it's God did it then he will do it now right amen it's not is he going to it is he had already done oh praise God have faith to believe brother brandom stood before Millions tens of thousands at a time sometimes and could call out people's names and tell tell them what was wrong with him people could come up in front of them one at a time and say you you are so and so your name is such and such you live at a such and such address you have the such and such disease and this is what's wrong you this and all those things to the very in degree to where this day regardless of how many reprobates have left this message there's not one of them could say or prove that there was one thing that brother random taught that was wrong not one every every single time it was right there yes why because brother because God sent him hunting God put in that man's heart for the Wilderness and he would go hunting and God says you're going to get a caribou today and his horns are going to be 42 Ines now that's very specific friends yeah that is a very specific number to say it's going that's pretty big too actually that's almost 4 foot going to be 42 inch horns he goes on the trip sure enough God gives him this Caribou I remember I think it was the testimony of maybe brother bis or someone and and they had that caribou and they took out the tape measure and that brother as they pulled that tape measure across that horn that brother said tape measure if you say anything other than 42 Ines you are a liar amen tap measure let me tell you tape measure if you don't say 42 you are wrong am the tape measure is wrong remember the brother's testimony pulled it right out 42 Ines exactly because that's what God told him right God building his confidence God increasing that confidence to realize the same God that said that that gave it to him that proved it in front of all those Brothers is the same God that was with him behind that pull pit when he called James or Susie Lou or or John do whoever it was and told them what their address was told him walking down the street skipping down the street seen you in front of the doctor you've got this thing this x-ray whatever it was he could do that because he knew that the same God that was here is the same God was going to be there right what is it for us now the same God has done it before if he's always done it he will always do it yeah amen he's not changed only thing that changes is US yeah right the only thing that happens sometimes is we lose our confidence we lose our faith it gets dulled or diminished somehow our heart begins to condemn us that's the devil call it what it is it's the devil amen I've seen that Caribou it's in the it it it's in the study up here right off First Avenue I've seen it been there touched it and Steve Smith who is what I've been told far more advanced hunter than brother Bram ever was of course he's consecrated his life to that brother bram's life was the ministry not hunting he was a he was a part-time casual Hunter brother brandham was his life was the ministry Steve Smith's life is hunting right he said when that when when that happens and those paddle horns the way they are once the animal dies because of the blood flow through it they start to shrink right the horn shrink you go up to that you go up there today Horn's still 42 inches still 42 and it's not going to ever change because that was the promise of God now would it have been acceptable and understandable that the horns would have shrank as they normally do of course it would but God wasn't going to let that happen right amen because that was a promise of his he out same trip told him about the Silver Tip Grizzly you get this Silver Tip Grizzly yeah they're hiking and walking and they get within like a half of well two miles in the camp Brothers with him brother brandom you better get you better get him here pretty soon last day last we only got a couple more miles to go we're out in the clearing it it there's no trees there's no anything where is this bear going to come from I don't know God said it they keep walking they get them off of the camp brother Brandon that bear better get here pretty soon we're almost to the camp he's coming don't worry about it he's coming you got to believe but the brothers around him like you know where is he going to come from then there's no trees there's no place you ever been you ever been to a place there's just no hiding place you go to the place or out in the desert or something there just no place nowhere for it to hide where's this big silver CHP ver going to come from right I don't know but the same God that gave a sacrifice to Abraham is the same God that's going to give me the promise that he told me right amen how half a mile from the camp brother random I can see the Camp it's about a half a mile away I can see it where is this bear coming from he said pretty soon that bear come out of nowhere and he took a gun I forgot what it was a low caliber gun and the guy said shoot it shoot him in the heart shoot him in the heart or something like that he said no said the Lord told me shoot him in the back don't shoot him in the back he'll still come and get us cuz he was right there and the the bear was right in front of him brother brandom shoots and the bear goes down the brother said brother brandom I believed you he said but I knew the bear was going to come but I didn't want him in my lap the bear fell right there amen from something that was not even supposed to happen not supposed to be there in a in in with a gun that wasn't supposed to even come close to killing that big Grizzly and and shooting in a place that wasn't supposed to kill him right and every bit of it God did exactly like he said he would do yes amen you know I've seen the skin of that Silver Tip originally too right amen it's in Jeffersonville or last time I knew it was amen because that was God's promised him now you can say when if that God can do that then what can he do just getting up in front of people getting up in front of and realize the same God that told me that's the same God that's telling me that your name is Susie the same God that gave me that bear is the same God that's telling me you have tuberculosis right the same God that told me that is the same God is telling me all these it helped give him confidence but now what does it do for us amen that that's that's great but and I believe all that and it does help encourage me but there's got to be something in my life it has to be something for us that we have personally that we grasp a hold of that God has done for us multiple things I would assume that God has done for us that same God doesn't change because another circumstance arises he's still the same am different circumstance but the same God he wasn't going to kill the caribou and not the bear because the bear is not a caribou he did both think about the squirrels he's sitting there and there's nothing around no squirrels he goes and setting the fork with astri and he and the spear speaks what are you doing here I'm hunting what you hunting for squirrel how many do you need three I think he said he wanted five a three will make a good a stew I need three to feed my family he said speaking amen speaking he said okay I I want to squirrel I'm paraphrasing of course shorten than the story I want one there shoot him right in the right in the right eye every shot 22 Rifle right in the right I believe it was the right eye shot him killed him next one com he said okay I want one right there shot him right out killed him bam 22 rifle same thing brother Bram said I thought myself I'm just G to I'm going to make this one difficult and he said I want that squirrel to come over here run over there and go over this and jump over that tree under that stump wherever ever it was and go over here and climb up in a tree that squirrels don't go in there's you know there trees out there squirrels won't typically go in they prefer Hardwoods uh they said I want to go up to that tree a Tre that a squirrel never would run and jump in especially with all the other trees around he would not go in that tree I want him to go in that tree and sit down that Limb and look at me pretty soon there comes this girl you say well that was just brother bandam story but I believe that story why do I believe it because the confidence I have with all the other things that we know are approvable things amen just as if though I was sitting there watching that squirrel come across the woods of course I was a squirrel Hunter too so I've seen squirrels do that myself I've seen squirrels come and jump on a on a on a on a tree about that big around right in front of me and look around at me amen I I I so I know what he saw I can picture my head and come and go right up in that tree right up on that exact Li turn around and look at brother BR boom right eye shot it Billy Paul says I ate the spoken word yeah because he took those squirrels home scanned them and made a stew out of them and the family ate it praise the Lord spoken World squirrel spoken word squirrels I ate them amen I believe that you think about the things that you think those are those are uh amazing what God has done but think about the things that God so many times so much of these things get suppressed what has God done for you what is the things that God has done in your life Miracles or healings or uh uh Supernatural things that God has done for you and look back I think if you sat down and thought of it long enough and ask the Lord to help you write a book I bet we all probably could come close to writing a book right of the things that the Lord has done just write those things out amen for us I could say for me and my wife our children Our Lives serving for God the things that he's done can write them all out in a book right amen that's just God though that's God doing it yes having the confidence the faith to believe it I had several more scriptures couple more quotes but I'm just going to read this one more scripture time's gotten away so one more scripture we're going to close it's in Hebrews chapter 3 I want to read this one more scripture read uh Hebrews chapter 3 amen praise the Lord you know we got to have confidence to one another too yes amen like I said hard to help one another unless we have confidence amen we got to have confidence faith in one another Brothers and Sisters in Christ amen now there's probably no there's there's no person on the planet Earth that knows my wife's mistakes more than I do nobody and there never will be but I still love her and I still have full 100% of utmost confidence in her even with all those things that I know amen I hope to believe she's same way but I know I can say that 100% I mean lately well that's a whole another subject but God is just when he's ever present he changes the situations and yeah um it's just phenomenal to me uh just to look back but but don't you know God's the same way when he looks when he looks at us right he he knows all things there's nothing you can surprise him with there's nothing you can do that he doesn't already know you're going to do so but he still has confidence in US amen and sometimes we look around him we look at the devil wants to make sure that we try to look at one another's faults mistakes and little things and and and lose because he wants us to lose confidence in one another that's right because if we lose confidence one another we're not we're not as close a group as we should be and I'm not talking about just our church I just I mean Believers yes period worldwide we lose confidence in one another just off of little things you know silly little things that happen sometimes that just sometimes that uh is offputting to some people they like well you know I don't have confidence in that person you know because he Parts his hair on the right instead of on the left uh you know it's like as a married cou you get divorced because one likes the toilet paper coming this way and one likes it coming under that way uh to me that's just silliness that's like a church breaking up because one wants to take communion with the little cups and the other group wants to take the big one cup so the whole church just splits and that's the truth that's a real story split I know I preached for that group of people I know they split completely tore the church apart cuz one one group wanted it in little cups the other group want it in one big cup Church doesn't exist today amen lost confidence over what brother and sister it it comes down to that sometimes we got to recognize that's just the devil right that's just the enemy trying to divide us trying to put a wedge there trying to cause us to lose confidence in one another amen don't let him do it don't let him do it whatever you do don't let him do it Hebrews chapter 3:2 couple of verses and we'll close Hebrews 3:12 take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin or unbelief amen now it's not talking about a little mistake or a little fault or a little slip unbelief that's why the previous verse says departing from the Living God losing confidence Faith exort one another wise today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast steadfast hold our confidence steadfast Until the End praise the Lord while it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the day of provocation when they provoke the Lord we stay solid steadfast true solid together amen unwavering believing and the confidence we have in God confidence we have in one another if we believe that we are of God then we should have the same confidence in one another as we have in God yes amen and I'll be honest with you you as a group of people and many of the Believers that I've known down through the years my wife my family I have more confidence than you and I do myself cuz again there is nobody on this planet Earth that knows Newton V failures more than he does oh amen I know my shortcomings more than anybody does so I have more confidence in you because we tend to try to look as human nature guess at the negative more than the positive and the shortcomings rather than the good amen the the failure rather than the accomplishments but I bet if we took record if we took score our accomplishments would outweigh our failures by billions of percentage anyway they would be astronomically outnumbered because God works through his children God's doing it through US amen amen so don't dwell on the mistakes the slip ups but dwell on that that that is the positive the up building the lifting not not not the condemnation amen but that that edifies and builds and lifts up and strengthens that's what brings us to the place that we our relationship with Christ amen it's being with the people being with the things thinking on the things it's anything good righteous holy think on those things amen let that confidence continue to exude through you so that we never lose that faith in God and let that Faith operate by that love that we have towards one another and towards God Amen let's stand if we could when we do the devil has won at least that battle he's not going to win the war but he may have at least won that battle amen but when we have faith towards one another and towards God and towards one another then God brings whatever you say we have confidence whatever you say God will make it happen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen listenting this course U my good

fire and brimstone that was just burning and burning and people running and screaming terrified and I watched it and it was coming towards me amen and I said God help me yes because I started to realize what it was and what was going on and it was encompassing and it destroying everything and everybody and I started screaming God help me God help me yes as it got closer and closer I finally said God I need you nobody can help me right now but you yes help me Lord and as the Dream came up and it kind of It kind of came to the place that it just it just stopped right there I woke up and I just thought Lord what's it going to be when all this this place is is devoured amen it'll be to the point that nothing can happen yes but what God allows and no one will be saved but those that call on the name of the Lord amen amen I remember very vividly Lord no one can help me but you yes that's right and that's the true things no one can help us but him praise the Lord but then he turns around and says whatever you ask in my name I'll do it yes praise the Lord All Saints that's the confidence we have towards our Lord Jesus amen whatever we need praise the Lord he is more than willing more than able to give it praise the Lord Jesus amen I pray here so many times ask God to move on all of our loved ones all of our family amen to Salvation to bring Salvation I don't care what the circumstances look like I don't care what the circumstances may present themselves Lord it can't be done without you you are the only one that can help praise the Lord I believe that and I believe he's doing it I believe it's done amen we just believe it live it have confidence faith I you can't believe what so and so did don't care don't care don't care what the circumstances look like I don't
