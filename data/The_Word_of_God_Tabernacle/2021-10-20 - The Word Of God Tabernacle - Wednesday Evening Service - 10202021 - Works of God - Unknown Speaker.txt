to him amen thank you for coming out on a wednesday night amen appreciate each one of you being here it's been half my day on the roof of a house laying pipe so it was uh it said i'm going it's just there's just no question amen we're having church so praise the lord thankful to the lord give us strength amen to have your bibles now let's turn to saint john chapter six amen saint john chapter 6 amen saint john chapter 6 we'll read a few verses here beginning with the 25th verse john chapter six uh we'll begin reading with verse 25 but before we do we just bow our heads for another word of prayer thank you lord jesus for another beautiful day that you give us lord thank you for life lord it's a privilege lord is i i guess i don't know maybe i'm getting a little open years uh it seems strange with some much older than in front of me but god it just uh it seems like that the years as the years roll by life becomes more precious right and it feels more precious lord and when people that i know and people that around me young and old lord are going are going on lord for one reason or the other we don't know god we just do believe that everything is your plans and in your hands god and not one person can pluck us out of your hand we thank you lord for the day we thank you for strength health and life for the blessings lord that you give us every day thank you for being here lord lord i pray that you bless and help those who weren't able to make it they may be streaming here today god may you bless them as well may your holy spirit come and power and manifestation take complete control over this service lord and the part of the ministering and bringing forth of your word father which we recognize acknowledge is the most important part that you address us in this word tonight may it come forth lord again empowering manifestation to show to us in here what you'd have us to see and know what would be here to bless us and help us encourage us in some way god we thank you father for this time and opportunity god again to uh to come to you to worship and to praise you now we expect you father as you said you would as you are lord hear lord to minister to us and to speak your word to our hearts may it not return void but accomplish in each one of us what you have it sent forth for and we'll give you all the praise honor and the glory for the name of the lord jesus christ amen saint john chapter 6 verse 25 read a couple of verses of scripture before we let you be seated again just a wednesday night just a little simple thought something that may be encouraging bless your hearts tonight saint john 6 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when cameest thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verify you ye seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that uh for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said thee unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he has sent yeah and you can be seated if you'd like amen you know a lot of times people are perplexed about the things that happen in their lives and what's going on and don't understand the things of the bible the things of god and it seems like let me just put it this way salvation is such an incredible gift it's the ultimate it's the number one if there was ever a gift that could have ever been given better than our salvation the lord jesus would have given it to us so salvation is the absolute best the forgiveness of our sins is the number one top best greatest thing that could have ever happened to us in our lives the forgiveness of sin the the the uh uh keeping from going to hell and lord taking it not just keeping us from but then taking us to heaven not just keeping us from the worst place that there exists but taking us to the very best place that exists and i guess it just comes into the mindset of people and and i know we'll say it does me too from time to time but it gets in the mindset of people that we just have a hard time believing how could this be free how could this be something that i don't have to work for it yes because from the day that we're born basically that we're taught to work where we used to be not sure about today's generation but when i was growing up people were taught to work right when i got old enough i was mowing grass or i didn't never had a paper rod or anything like that but i mow grass to have a little money and did things around the house wash my dad's car and i did things to earn a little bit of money so i could have a little bit of something for myself and i just was taught a work ethic from a very young age and i guess that we get to the place that when a man fell and he had to begin to work by the sweat of his brow that everything that he did came through labors came through sweat came through muscle came through strain came through giving of the strength of your body and when we look at salvation and there's absolutely nothing you can do to gain it there's nothing you can do to earn it there's absolutely nothing you can no work that you can do to earn it or inherit it you can't be good enough you can't find yourself in the self in the best place you can't come to church enough you can't give enough money you can't preach enough sermons you can't sing enough songs you can't give enough strength to be able to earn what the lord jesus has done for us and so many times people get in their minds i gotta do something amen i gotta do something and of course people in this situation when they get a little ridiology or religious when they feel like they have to have some religion to be able to get them to heaven of course the greatest thing in our time the greatest culprit of that of course is catholicism because catholicism is all about work work work work work the only way you're ever going to find favor to god is work the only way you're going to be pleased with the lord is is is is suffer and toil and work and be miserable that's the only way you're ever gonna that's the only way you're ever gonna get anywhere with god and that's what they teach you from the very beginning but there's absolutely nothing we can do there's not one single work we can work to work the work of god so what when they come and they ask him they ask jesus because he said labor not for that meat which perish so what meat are we laboring for and this is the work of god where or the works based religion whichever way i i kind of had two titles for this one but i i think i'm going with the works of god but he said labor not for the meat which perish which of course is the strength and the and the the muscle that we give and the sweat of our brow he said uh but labor for that which lasts their everlasting life then they send us so what did they garner from that from that one single sentence what did these people that that obviously disciples that left the lord they were only following him as he said because their bellies were full they saw the miracles and all these things happen and they followed after him like so many times people do the trick pony you know everybody sees the trick pony or the little the little uh miracle or the little this that and that always gets people's attention amen sometimes that's not even a lot of times probably that's not even of god but they got to see the little trick pony you know brother ram talked about uh uh being drawn to a fire rather than the painted fire right amen or actual fire brother you can't get warm from a pain in fire right so their their question this is what they get from what his statement was their question had become then they said unto him what shall we do so what are we going to have to do that we might work the works of god what work can we do right how can we earn this how can how can we merit this and what is it that you're looking for us to do what is it that we can do to be able to earn this and jesus said well if you want to do the work of god believe on him whom he has sent that's the work that is the work that is to be done to be able to obtain salvation and eternal life and forgiveness of sin is believe on the lord jesus whom he has sent that's the work pretty simple isn't it but you know a lot of people can't take that a lot of people that blows their minds they're thinking all i have to do is to believe on the lord jesus and then i can i can receive that meat i can receive that inheritance i can receive those blessings i can receive eternal life just by believing on him right yep that's it yes amen praise the lord that kind of shoots the work based religion all the pieces doesn't but people fish but people still do it a lot of times people get it in their minds i still got to do something i i got to do something but you know when you get saved and you get filled with the holy ghost and you believe the lord it obviously puts your feet on a path of righteousness that puts us busy working for the lord right i'm not discounting exactly because those works obviously just uh are just a simple display of the faith that we had in him exactly so our faith in him is that uh acknowledgement that he just said that gives you the meat but then you know you you continue on with the uh with with the work of the lord to doing whatever the lord puts on our paths to do we know we do that but it's not a work it's not a work then it's a life right see there's a difference in in laboring for the work and just living your life amen there's a difference there's a difference in working and and laboring for something or or striving for something it's sort of like the difference between uh uh living holiness and uh living legalism right a lot of people like to live legalism because they feel like they're doing something they feel like they're sacrificing something friends that's catholicism right uh ash wednesday or lent that's i think that's what's clint give up something for lent so you got to make sure this day or this one time you know they're going to give up something for lent that's not what jesus asked us to do that's not the what the scripture asks us to do amen truly sometimes we do sacrifice things that the lord tells us i know one time i got to uh i really got way too involved when i was in north carolina years ago and and i was purchasing manager i had a job and i had sales consultants call me all the time and they're always wanting to take me to play golf i had friends who wanted to go and take me and let's go play golf together and my brother-in-law loved to play golf but i it was like i was surrounded by dozens and dozens of other men and wanted to go play golf i ended up playing golf all the time to where i became so consumed with it i went to a prayer meeting we had at the church one night nailed down the front pew and the lord said stop it now i said but lord it's really not getting a hold of me you know how we are right it's really not taking control of me stop it now and i and and then i started thinking about it and then i started thinking about this and how it led to this and how i went to this and i thought oh my lord no wonder it is overtaking me it's like most of the waking moments i have is is about that game and the lord told me to stop it right and i did i stopped it from that time i quit playing i stopped playing and it finally got to the place that uh i felt the lord was like you know in moderation a little here little there of course now it's like once a year maybe at the most maybe two i don't just don't have time anymore really but but you understand what i'm saying it can't get to the place this is all consuming to you and the lord says i better be first in your life not this and then he'll speak to you and say okay you need to stop doing this but just to say oh i'm going to pick a friday and i'm just going to not eat a steak on that friday or or or whatever i'm not gonna go over my favorite bridge when i go home today or whatever i don't know what they decide to give up for lent but something that they just arbitrarily decide hey i'm gonna give this up and and and and i'll be okay but that's religion-based work right that's that's a work based religion that's not a that's not salvation that's not what god's looking for god's looking for something of faith and your faith then will cause you to start doing works for the lord but again at that point they're not works anymore they're a life they're just a life that you live for the lord jesus you do it for god it's not something you feel like well i got a work of work and these people they felt like well we got a work of work look what jesus said over here in john and saint john chapter four in saint john chapter four uh verse 31 he said in the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying master eat but he said unto them i have meat that you know not of now what did they get from that his own disciples obviously of course his holy spirit hadn't come back so it's just it was simply jesus with them if you want to know sort of what it's like that's a little different because the anointing is falling but if you want to know sort of what it's like to have uh jesus with you just read the bible and the men and the ones that were with them and how they acted and what they did and how they lived you'll kind of understand a little bit of what it is with jesus simply with you not in you see there's where the difference comes to the day of pentecost when jesus come in them then it changed them completely and then it's no longer you working the work again it's the spirit in you living the life jesus said i have meat that you know not of therefore said the disciples what did they get from that now one of the one to another have any man bought him ought to eat to thinking carnal amen thinking carnal jesus said unto them what is it my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work praise the lord what how is that me different from the meat he was trying to give them how is that me any different than what he gives us today it's saying me amen that's the meat that we labor for that's the faith that we that we project is to do the will of the father to do the will of god whatever it is that the lord puts in our path that's what we are to do but it's not i i know it talks about the works in the bible i but i don't look at it as words again i look at it as is you you do it because it's just the life that you live because of who you are right yes so many times now years ago the lord showed me this even back where uh i was writing the book uh i i started the lord started to impress that upon me so strong and it seems like in so many different avenues and so many different passes the lord keeps bringing that very notion right back to me the difference is that we all live who we are and some people just aren't who they say they are that's the difference people who are who they say they are live the life that they claim to serve they emulate that word they emulate that life because they live that life because that's who they are right now it becomes a struggle of legalism if you're not born again it just becomes a fight and a struggle uh every time you have to try to put on that dress or let your hair grow or or or or or or be a man today uh just be what god has called you to be but if it's who you are it's not a struggle then it's a life of holiness because you're living who you are it doesn't become a fight it doesn't it doesn't become a push-pull because you're living the life of who you are because you're a christian you're a holy ghost field bloodball born again son or daughter of god amen and that's who you are if you're not that and you claim to be that you're just living a life of legalism and it becomes such a struggle it becomes so hard and you find people's lives becoming so miserable because they think they've gotta they gotta work this work well i've gotta work this work what would so and so say well friend i i don't take this wrong cause i do care right but i'm gonna say it this way i don't care what other people think i care what he thinks the one that i care the most about what he can is concerned with me is the lord not the people around me now i do i do care about what people think of me obviously we all do to a degree but i care more about what he thinks in other words i'd rather have the whole world hate me and him love me right than the other way around right so it becomes such a struggle for people and people live that struggle daily people absolutely daily you may know some who live that struggle of legalism because they're not who they say they are they're fighting that their their word they're trying to work that work and it's not in them to do they they fake it oh my i've seen people years and years and years and years go on and and come to message churches and live a live of what we consider a holiness standard but inside them there's the turmoil of having to work this it becomes a works-based religion then it's not faith faith is just living who you are amen and and that that battle cry really has continues to reverberate in in my messages and my thoughts and my witnessing and people i talked to so many times i was talking to somebody on the job the other day and i said george you can only be who you are yeah i i mean it just came out i said people can only be who they are they look that way because that's who they are right they dress that way because that's who they are i'm sorry going back into some things i've said a few weeks ago but it's just true they they listen to the music they listen to because that's who they are they paint and tattoo and scar and cut their bodies all over because that's who they are and i don't blame them for that that's just who they are yeah i just don't want them doing it next door down the road it's fine this man go over and go a few four five miles down the road open up shop and be successful whatever that's okay just not here but they can only do that because that's who they are but it becomes but as as christians as as uh people that call ourselves christians it becomes such a work-based religion for so many people they feel like they have to work that work and that's the only way they're going to be pleasing to god is if they do a work that's pleasing to god look at this let's go to matthew chapter 19. amen matthew chapter 19. let's look at this man we've looked at him off and on and i have a story of him in my book but um he's preached on quite often and man's put down quite a bit but you know again like so many other people so many other instances a person can only be what they are amen amen we just hope and pray they're more than what they're projecting they are you understand uh because you know we love people we we love the souls of men and want them to go to heaven we don't want anybody to go to hell so it it that's the burden that's the that's the conflict that we feel within us because yeah what on one hand they can only be what they are and who they are but on the other hand i want them to be more i want them to give their life to the lord jesus and quit living that way so that that becomes the conflict but look at this man here this man had a conflict he wrestled with jesus so to say he didn't physically wrestle but uh matthew 19 now of course uh three of the books record the ritual ruler story i still kind of favor the 19 the the one in matthew even though there's a couple of other parts i like uh from uh luke mark and luke especially where the bible says that jesus didn't but i i like the way uh matthews is situated so yes this is about the rich young ruler verse 16 let's start and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing look at how he starts off his conversation with jesus good master what good thing yeah thing work ability something i can do or give cause he's a rich man so what what can i give you know a lot of people have a habit especially a lot of preach people they have it of not really caring uh of consequences of actions they just try to throw money at it after it's done yeah yeah well here's a couple million dollars oh it's okay then no it's not okay you ruin people's lives but they they just throw money at it that's their solution and and i guess in my mind that's kind of what i would think this man is thinking he's thinking about along monetarily why what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life so he's thinking right off this can be bought this can be paid for this can be worked this can be i can do something to to earn this he said unto him why call us thou mean good there is none good but one that is gone but if you will free moral agency now right god's given the man a chance just like he gave cain a chance just like every human ever born of a woman has been given a chance had an opportunity and free moral agency and he said if you will so it's up to you amen amen puts it in his lap if you will enter into life keep the commandments he said unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt steal thou shalt not not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and love thy neighbor as thyself now every one of these is in the ten commandments except one right and that's the last one the last one says thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself why do you think maybe that jesus now i i depict this and have before as jesus discerning the man's heart just like brother branham did when people come up to him and the lord would deserve it and and so now it was the lord's discernment but the the lord would show brother brown right of what it was and so that discerning was going on and as the discernment is the discussion remember brother adam said you want to keep talking like this to contact your spirit right well why do you think jesus didn't just say didn't just cut the rich young ruler off he started talking to him right he engaged him in a conversation reaching contacting his spirit amen and and and then he tells him these few of the ten commandments but then he throws one in that's not a ten commandment why my assessment my feeling is that jesus found the impediment in the man's heart he loved his money more than he loved god right his his god was his money that now that's my the bible doesn't say that actually his actions later on pretty much prove that to be true but i say it this way he loved his money more than he loved god so god found that impediment in his life and said uh love thy neighbor as thyself now he thinks that he has this mages he says young man said unto him all these things have i kept from my youth uh you thought what lack i yet praise god jesus said again if you will amen he's still putting in his lap he's letting him know this is your choice this is your decision you have you're at a crossroads right now rich young ruler which way are you going to take he says if you will be perfect go and sell all thou hast and give to the poor and now shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me oh my the one thing the one thing this is a good man this this man was such a good man that again the bible said he looked on him and loved him yes amen he looked up i mean this is actually contrary of course to when he platted the ropes and looked upon with anger and beat him with anger this man he looked on and loved him amen he loved him so we we know he had a compassion we know he was a good man but being good is not good enough working the works is not enough i hope mother teresa is there one day but i have my doubts i'm sorry i do the works based religion that she served was not enough to get her there right now i hope maybe before she passed on that the lord came into her life in her heart and she accepted him and uh and and and and the scripture was fulfilled in her life i don't judge anybody i don't know where anybody that's that's up to god that's that's his choice uh he there's been a many a bet dead confession death bed and i was and i wasn't there so i don't know i hope she did i don't know my point being is all the good things she did for the whole world all the good things she did for all the starving children and those that are sick and needy and that and that's wonderful god i mean i say god bless you she's gone on but you know what i'm saying but that in itself is not enough to get you there that in itself is not salvation working works is not salvation but a lot of people think it is yeah and a lot of people who may have even had that and they have even felt that experience almost feel like it just this just just got to be some work amen friend there is no word rest at peace amen and let the lord lead you wherever the lord amen that's where you go wherever you go that's what he has you do amen whatever he has you do you do is unto the lord yes that's every day everything and in every way you do it as unto the lord amen amen amen that's how we do now this man when he heard this he went away sorry because he had great possessions amen he could not enter in because of his possessions this was the hindrance to him this was the thing that kept him out now it doesn't have to be hordes of money now and we know the man didn't go broke after this a lot of people say oh he'll he'll go broke down he got richer he had to tear down his barns perfectly nice buildings just to build bigger ones to hold all of his stuff so he didn't go broke he didn't get poorer but we know where he ended up the bible says so he ended in the regions of the lost just a dip of water amen what was his desire though his desire was to do a thing to do something to earn it throw some money at it pay somebody help somebody do something to earn it you can't do anything to earn it if you've done what jesus said do to them in in john 16 and that spirit has come into you then you live that life that god is pleased with just like we talked about sunday enoch walked with god was pleasing to god noah walk was pleasing amen and and and we know what the end result is in that case but it's not based on a works-based religion amen it was something as this rich young ruler it was something that the lord had asked for that all of a sudden kind of like that uh kind of like that story that brother branham used to tell the eagles tourists her nest you know the eagles earth how does she stir that nest well she gets that nest first of all comfy and soft and gets all the rabbit skins and feathers and everything and she puts a nice pad down and when those babies are born their baby they're they're born onto a nice soft rabbity uh feathery bed and it feels so good but when those babies start getting a little bit older she starts carrying some of them feathers and a piece of that rabbit skin out and and all of a sudden the little place that used to feel comfortable to them they go sit down and hit a thorn because their nest is made out of thorns and they go and hit a thorn and now oh my that doesn't feel comfortable well pretty soon the nest becomes all thorns to where they get that's exactly what jesus does amen so many times that's exactly how jesus treats us and and move do something give work work the works of the lord or be led of the lord amen that that's that's what he wants us to do um ephesians chapter 2 verse 4. i'm going to close here just a few minutes ephesians chapter two but that nest that bene that nest became such a comfort zone for those little eaglets they got so comfortable and eased in zion i mean who doesn't you ever held a rabbit i love holding the rabbit so soft it's like one of the softest things i've ever held is a pretty little special little baby rabbit or so soft who wouldn't want to stay in that that's a comfort zone but this rich young ruler was in his comfort zone but once jesus said sell everything you've got not just a dollar not just a thousand dollars not just a house or a car sell everything you've got and take every bit of it and give it to your neighbors prove that you love them amen jesus was putting them to the test you say you love your neighbor as yourself then take your money and give it to them same difference right because it was your money but you love them as much as you love yourself so take your money and give it to them hmm he couldn't do it now jesus found something now the ten commandments he was a good fella so all that was nice and cushiony and that was good rabbit skin and every time he sat down on commandment he's like i've got that one he sit down oh i've got that one jesus named another and he said oh i got that one but then when jesus ripped out that big huge piece of rabbit skin and said sell all you got to give to the poor and he went and sit down on that thorn he couldn't he left his comfort zone then he had to get out of there because it was he he he was out it was out of what he wanted to do and that's a lot of times what people will do when they feel like they want to do it's like it's like the land i was talking about oh uh oh it's like me saying oh i'll i'll give up sushi this friday i i won't eat sushi this friday for the lord or or celery i'm i'm not doing any celery this friday and i promise you saints unless there is a miracle or some levitation or some change in my taste buds there'll be no celery entering this mouth friday none ever if i could ever help it the rest of my life but definitely so so friday i'm giving up i'm giving up celery for lent how's that that's the attitude a lot of people have oh i want to give to the lord but they only only give them what they want to give him right they won't want to give him what he wants it's like brother random free said uh doors in the heart and god goes in there and knocks and all the doors roam everything's swept garnish and everything's beautiful and oh jesus you're welcome in my heart go to any room you want to go in just to enter in and all and jesus looked over and said well what's that one over there oh well uh that door is closed um yeah you can't go in that one well how can you feel welcome amen how can you feel welcome every door's not open if everything is not open and welcoming to him how can you how can anybody feel welcome you ever gone on a house that looked like a museum and you got nothing nothing wrong with that i love people keep a clean house wish i could i i love people keep it clean how's you ever been in one museum and you're going and they're like oh make yourself at home and you go over and you sense oh don't sit there okay have anything in the fridge okay no don't take that well i'll stand here right i mean who feels welcome like that well jesus certainly doesn't and that's exactly a lot of people say i'll give you everything but don't lord don't touch this i can't give you that don't go over there and i don't meddle in that door now and that's and people drink god that way and that's not the way it works that's not how it and pardon the pun that's not how it works people want to work the works of the lord but it's just like the rich young ruler oh i give all this i'll do all this but when it came to giving everything he had and give it to his neighbors so we couldn't do that amen couldn't do that that was out of his comfort zone yeah and then and then you see where people get and it's the same religion people have a lot of work works but you know i only want to do what i want to do i'm only going to give him what i want to give him i'm only going to uh go where i want to go see i i don't well you need to go here and i don't want to go there no i'm sending you down here but i don't want to go there i'm not going to go there and jonah did that you know he actually charged about purposely to go a different direction he didn't even he jonah didn't just stay put he purposely chartered something to go the other way right and a lot of people that just did the exact same thing amen do the exact same thing i remember when we moved to florida i've said this many times we we had gone to florida on vacation and we were coming back up to florida and got in there and i said i looked at my wife and i said florida was a nice place to live live a visit but i sure wouldn't want to live here less than a year later what we were living there because god said you're going no that's what people do i'm not going to go i'm not going to do that but the lord always if you want to do what god is calling you to do you're going to be willing to do it whatever the cost ephesians chapter 2 i think i had to turn there ephesians 2 for verse 4. the god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and as up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that's our spiritual rapture that in the ages to come he might show us the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus by grace are ye saved through faith which goes back to jesus john 6 believe on him who is he whom he has sent faith right so it's by you are saved by grace through faith and it's not of yourselves it is the gift of god it is not a works that any man should boast about right amen now what is the what is the work of work the work of god to believe on him whom he has sinned amen that faith will put your your feet on the path on that straight and narrow path to work the work of the lord let me read a couple other scriptures here romans chapter 9 verse 30. romans 9 30 what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness listen now the gentiles which followed out not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even as the righteousness which is of faith righteousness of the gentiles is a righteousness of faith not a righteousness of works not a righteousness of law but a righteousness of faith by grace are you saved through faith so our righteousness is nothing we did nothing we could ever do amen we receive that righteousness and we become that very righteousness by faith in jesus christ but israel which followed after the law of righteousness so the law is righteous people want to you know say about the law but the law is righteous and israel follows after that righteousness but they follow it by a law not by a life they follow it by a work and not by a faith not by a life it is the legalism to our holiness amen hath not attained to the law of righteousness of course we know the scripture says no flesh no flesh can't be righteous by the law it's impossible since the fall and sin entered in there's no way that we can attain to that it is no way to be able to be righteous enough to live every single law of god amen wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law so they tried to work the work they still tried they're doing their best to do it and god will honor that god dawgs on it because that's his people amen god that's his people so he is honoring that when he comes back and then they will do their works when jesus comes and reveals himself to his people friend they don't receive the righteousness of jesus by work by a law they receive it because they finally believe in their messiah they receive their messiah and the righteousness of their messiah then comes on them but of course that has to be after god's done with the gentiles after the after the the rapture after the wedding supper he comes back and reveals himself amen and then that's where they attain it but now as it says they sought it not by faith but by works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling song which was jesus christ as it is written behold i lay in zion a chief stumbles uh stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believe on him shall not be ashamed jesus christ again they weren't blinded cults god said you're blind i'm blinding your eyes and you won't be able to see it they were blinded because they had everything else in mind that they were looking for they weren't expecting their messiah to be born on a manure pile they weren't expecting their messiah to be told about how he was an illegitimate child and his mother had him out of wedlock she wasn't that that wasn't something they wanted right they weren't looking for their messiah to come and and rags and and and walking through dung and and living the life of a pauper they they were expecting a mighty god to come and raise shoot down from the sky and come and i am your god worship me smite all the enemy and and slay them and kill them and right there in front of it that that wasn't that wasn't the bible and that wasn't the work of god but that's and so they missed him their eyes were blinded because they were looking for something else amen you know you can look right at something and not see it and have you ever done that i've actually i have looked right at something how many times they said you're looking for something say honey i'm looking for this i can't find this and then all of a sudden you see and it's sitting right there and you think mine if it was a snake it bit me you ever said this is a snake you bit me looking right at it miss it but that's what people do and they missed him because they tried to work a work they tried because they were they blinded to what they were expecting and their and they they tried to attain righteousness by work they try to obtain the righteousness of god by a work and it doesn't by the work of the law it doesn't work that way again pardon the pun but it doesn't work that way it comes by the righteousness of jesus christ through faith and by grace by that faith through the grace you are saved and that's and then we simply it is it's that simple then you become the righteousness of god i was gonna read james chapter two if you wanna go there read that later or i'm gonna close here but uh if you wanna read james chapter two it talks about the conflict of faith and law and works and and and having works by faith and that type of thing we know those scriptures but the point then is that it's not something that we can earn right it's a free gift that god gave us now it cost him but it's free to us the work that we work for god is the acknowledgement of faith that we have that he is thank you king of kings lord of lords the almighty god alpha omega beginning ending first and last top bottom all-around rows of shared lily of the valley he's everything amen we acknowledge that we believe that and we live as such amen our lives are not a life of work they're a life of of expression of christ of that spirit living in us again if you live who you are it doesn't become labor amen how many have you ever heard if you if you do something you love for a living you'll never work a day in your home i've never been able to do that but i sure would like to i love doing this i love being a pastor but the other stuff sometimes entrepreneur on the roof of a house or something sometimes isn't much as much fun but uh i i enjoy it though with brother roger it's very nice uh the fellowship but you understand it's just being who you are just being who you are then it's not a labor it's not a work then amen it becomes a work when you think oh i've got to do this i've got to do this and i i got to work this work and i've got to you know i got to quota of people this week that's and people get that in their minds but it's not about that right amen amen be led of god let the lord lead you before he leads you he'll he'll bless you where he blesses you he'll give you work to do whatever that work is he'll show you you do it faithfully amen when that works over you do something else whatever else he sends you amen praise the lord but it's the work of god what did jesus say was the work of god believing on him whom he has sent amen praise god let's stand if we could amen amen leaving on him whom he has sinned and a lot of people believe that and i even talk to people from time to time good christian people good godly people and they keep having in their minds they make their lives miserable they get in a state of depression because of it oh friend don't let the devil do that to you amen there's no there's no sadness depression negativity in the lord at all so if any spirit is causing you to be that way it's not him amen 460. let's sing this little course
