========================================
[Music] introduced at niacia by the catholic church and trying to split god into three pieces and say three different gods and three personalities you can't have three personnel they say he's one god with three personalities you can't have a personality without having a person right amen so it's so they basically chop them into three pieces but he's one god and that that understanding and revelation was to be brought forth in this last day in this eagle age and the anointing of the flying eagle was supposed to be a prophetic age which son of man is prophet a prophetic age to reach the heights to be able to see the things that have been hid down through the ages and generations was to be made known and manifested revealed in this last day so we know that not only was satan revealed not only was satan exposed to the church ages but we also know that jesus christ was revealed to his bride and who he is yes amen now the revealing of that son of man we know has happened today so that revealing brings us to the point of now the day that we live yes now brother branham's been gone off the scene almost 56 years yeah and i've told you how it's easy for me to figure that out because he passed away right after i was born and i know i'm about to turn 56 so i know he died he's been gone almost 56 years so it's easy for me but 56 years so in other words i don't keep track of brother from how long he's been gone i just remember because of that fact but that puts us in position now 56 years since the revealing of the son of man well and then that's the case in what day are we living well jesus said again two very divine defining characteristics of the days that jesus referred to that was going to be like today now the first one of them we know as he said was in the days of noah okay in the days of noah now we know about noah we know about the ark and the 120 years building the ark and and the tribulation and the rain and the flood and we know we know all those things but look what jesus put down as as those uh characteristics that was going on in the andaluvian world before the flood very defining characteristics that jesus considered that jesus brought profoundly as something that was that was contrary to him contrary to god the word and that was they did eat they drank they married wives and they were given in marriage those are the four things rally is three things because one is encompasses the two but the one is eat and drink well i think well what's so unusual about eating and drinking don't we do that to survive but that's not the point that jesus was making because the point that he was making here was the eating part was the gluttonous part they weren't just eating to sustain life they were eating to substance they were eating in a gluttonous manner and the drink is not just an iced tea or an ice water it was uh a drunkenness giving themselves over to wine into strong drink and becoming drunkards or as the scripture refers to as wine bibbers so when they were talking about eating and drinking he was referring to the overindulgence of of gluttonous eating and and becoming drunk and becoming a wine biver and two of course we know of very uh stark uh identifications of things that are 100 percent against god and his word amen so those are two things that he gave as he talked about no the other was they married wives they were given in marriage well you think well i married a wife uh her dad brought her down and give her to me in marriage but if you go back and you see what brother branham said about it he talked about as it was in the days of noah where they were marrying a given in marriage and marriage and giving in marriage and over and over and divorced and marriage and divorce over and over and that's exactly what uh that even that jesus was talking about in the days of noah it became to where marriage and divorce was irrelevant to people there was no sanctity to it anymore a lot of people in into marriage vows and they have no sanctity they have no uh no conception of the fact of what they're doing and binding themselves together as one flesh forever when i counsel people and there's those that are here that i've counseled that they'll tell you i i tell them when you go into a marriage and you say i do you do it with the understanding that the word divorce does not exist right now i say that understands people in here spend divorce okay but i tell them you go into this with the understanding that the word divorce does not exist the concept of being divorced is not it null and void doesn't exist if they're coming to this together to understand that this is supposed to be a union that is supposed to be something that lasts your whole life join together in one flesh but but my but my point then being is like it is today look how it is today it doesn't mean anything to people anymore marriage and marriage vows mean so little anymore to people they'll just say well i'm going in and thought like it's not getting me another one people enter into agreements like that with the thought process well i just if this just doesn't suit me then i'll go get me another one now i know things happen that are unforeseen and divorce does take place but you don't go into it looking for that right but there are people today that believe that marriage is so uh is not an institution right it's just something that you do let's go to dinner oh great yeah let's go to dinner oh let's get married okay let's have a picnic yeah that sounds great uh let's get a job or let's go to work or this whatever well let's just get married it's just it's just the thing people do there's no sanctity to it and i believe that's the part that jesus was talking about they entered into these things and and of course marriage today has got to the place to where uh not even half of them survive it probably way less less than half anymore that actually survive even if they've gone 10 15 20 years sometimes you hear about people 25 30 years getting divorced yeah i'm thinking you're 65 who'll have you you know yeah but like my wife says there's somebody for everybody uh and we've come to find that to be true in a lot of cases but somebody for everybody i mean i got hurt so that proves that point but the sanctity of it i think is the issue that jesus is talking about and that brother branham was talking about right the sanctity of marriage it doesn't it it is an inner it wasn't entered into at that time it would with the sanctity that it should have been yeah uh and today i believe today in a lot of ways in a lot of places a lot of people it's not entered into today it just becomes a big celebration you hear sometimes the people they spend fifty sixty thousand dollars on a wedding in three weeks they're divorced they're separated right because it's not just not entered into with that with that reverence with that humility and with that love see the the love should begin in a marriage the love and the marriage should begin with the love of each individual with god if the love of each that individual is for god first then their union is going to survive because they because they come together in that love of god together with the love of each other but it's the love of god that binds them amen amen and that's and that divining characteristic that that jesus gave for us to understand in the days of noah yeah the flood and all those things happen but the wickedness that he was talking about see here brother man says the world's falling apart again he said these episodes has been on the earth since the days of noah we find out when god had noah the prophet of righteousness going forth with his message there was an episode of immorality in that day as the bible says eating drinking marrying giving in marriage we find out gluttonous and immorality and so forth taken place in that day and then the world fell apart because the people rejected the message of god for that day noah was a prophet anointed if god sent of god with a message from god he gave the people a warning before the judgment came and they snickered and laughed and made fun of it scoff the whole world system fell apart in that day and they drowned beneath the seas that's right why because they rejected the message of the hour right i mean brother random even talked about uh and i'm sure it's a hundred times worse some things of course we're sheltered from because we don't involve ourselves with that part of the world but he talked about uh those times where they would have couples all together and and and all of them would throw their keys and a hat and he said and the men would come up or the women would come up whoever it was and they'd just grab a key and whoever keys they pulled out that's the person they stayed with that night just the immorality friend and that wasn't in noah's day although it was the noah's day that he was talking about that for his day well if it was like that 60 years ago what do you think it's like now i have no idea because again i don't acquaint myself in those circles i have no idea what those people do but it's i'm sure in the increase of the sin it's got to be worse than it was then oh my but that's the one the thing that jesus was referring to brother branham was referring to gluttonous immorality taken place in that day because they rejected the word amen very much we swear we see it swirling around us today friend now who is the second one the second one we know is that likewise also as it was in the days of life the days of lot now we know a lot we know about the things that happen in sodom and gomorrah and lot and abraham rescuing him and of course lot lot already had it in his heart to go become a part of the car become a part of the city uh la had a chance to go anywhere he wanted to when abraham and lot's herdsmen began to fight will be amongst one another and abraham came to the place they realized there had to be a separation abraham told lot look lot we got country all around us you go wherever you want to go lot looks out he sees the big city of sodom and he says i believe i'll go down there amen who's going to choose that so it was already in his heart to do but but lot then went down to sodom purposely to live there brother adam called him the bear of the city but lot was there in sodom we know those things now the first two characteristics that he gives about law are the same characteristics he gave about noah so i would imagine those two characteristics are very important because he began noah with eating and drinking and he begins lot with eating and drinking right same thing the eating of gluttonous the drinking of of of drunkenness wine bidding amen becoming a drunkard so those situations still fit with noah and with lot the eating and drinking but now there's a difference here he says they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it he doesn't say anything about marriage and divorce not with lot why do you think that maybe maybe that jesus didn't refer to the marriage and divorce in lot state like he did in noah's day now not that it was a new spirit but the prevalence of that spirit had become so strong in lot's day that god refers to it he doesn't talk about the marriage and divorce but if you notice the one thing when you think about sodom and gomorrah and the moralities of the of the men and women in that city that day what's the number one thing you think about homosexuality that's right well there was no marriage in divorce because they weren't marrying women they were just coming together in such an immoral way that that that's the characteristic that god defined for it when when lot when or when the two angels went down to lot when those two male angels went down the lot the men came in and they wanted to know those men the angels of god michael and gabriel brother branham called them at one point he wanted to have they wanted to have relation with those men and and lot's like no no no leave these are my guests leave them alone i'll send you my daughters and they said no we don't want the women we want the men now friend if that's not what we're talking about today i don't know what we are talking about right i don't know what we see around in the world today if we don't see that as a whole cell even acceptance right of that spirit today i don't know what there is that's right even an acceptance by what we call or define ourselves as a christian nation of course less and less people are defining it at that yeah i'm one of them as we got to that point yeah are we a christian nation anymore i mean when we think about the things that's being defined down through there and the the acceptance of that kind of immorality the acceptance of the drinking uh you you look at any more and you see churchgoers and ministers and and people that proclaim to be christians wearing crosses and all this and you can't hardly watch a newscast but they don't talk about drinking a beer right or going out to the bar or or something to that effect got a cross talking about god and jesus and they're this great dividing christians and they're going out afterwards to drop a few right that's the defining characteristic thing if that it is exactly now as it was then it now it's grown since if you think it was anything like that when brother brannan was here oh man if you considered or called yourself a christian i don't mean a catholic or a denomination had gone off or something but i mean you really considered yourself a christian that was something that wasn't even in the conversation that that did that just did not happen if you were a godly child of god and you loved the lord and you claimed christ as your savior that drinking was not even considered right now understand spirits are still spirits and we're still humans and those spirits will pull on you amen that's why you need to be we all need to stay fortified as much as we can behind the blood stay under that blood stay under christ stay in his word and let those spirits say we're trying to drive them on you bounce off and go somewhere you said i'm a child of god satan i don't do that right i don't live like that but the eating drinking and look the homosexuality there that that one driving force i want to read this quote because i want to get into the next part with some other scripture because as i began to look at that yesterday i didn't think a whole lot about it all these times i've read the bible and and and i've studied it and it just was never something that struck me you know usually in the message you go to revelation or you go to saint luke 17 30 even thus as in days and son of man uh it'll be when the son of man is revealed that's that that scripture that we think of brother branham his ministry and and christ coming and revealing himself showing himself to uh to a group of people for this last day we had to have that saints to go in a rapture that had to be known that had to be revealed before there could ever be a rapture how do you think of the group of people would ever have a body change to go into rapture if we didn't even know who jesus christ was have a truth of the godhead of christ and his word how how could that ever have happened so it had to be but it was going to be at the end time the end time because only at the end time is there to be an alive and remain group all the other ages they all went by the way of the grave this last day is the only day the only group that's going to have an alive and remain group no other age had that so this last day very important amen the faith that it takes to realize where we're standing in the days it was in the son of man it is today look what brother brown said here in this day the scripture is fulfilled but when i started looking at that now uh uh it led me to several other scriptures things i want to i want to bring to you now this day this scripture is fulfilled he said how about in our priesthood he said tonight i got a piece of paper over in los angeles california of where a bunch of clergymen baptist presbyterian ministers brought a bunch of homosexuals in and practiced homosexual saying they were trying to win them to god oh gosh that's like sliding up to a drunkard in a bar and say hit me bartender and try to witness to the guy sitting next to you oh do you know do you know jesus two or three drinks later i i i thought i knew him oh i see him now well yeah cause you're three sheep ten sheets to the wind you're drunk as a skunk now that's why you're seeing all kinds of stuff now you get to that place people take drugs and all kinds of things i want to see a a a a vision or something i want to see god who you know you keep taking that stuff you're going to see all kinds of things things you might not want to see too yes but that's like saying it's like going up next to a drunk and start drinking with them and try to win them to christ oh well come on in all you're doing is inviting that spirit into your life right in spite inviting that spirit onto your flesh and the weakness of your flesh what do you think is going to happen you lay an adult a better the dog that's got fleas you're going to come out with fleas that's just the way it is he said trying to win them to to christ try to win them to god he said when that's one of the curses of the hour the law he says the law even arrested those men and now where are we at our whole system has rotted out from under us i've seen the increase in homosexual across the united states has increased 20 to 30 over last year think of that man living with man just exactly like they did in sodom right well if it was that way in 1965 what is it today right right my friend think about where we're at what day are we living today i mean unless you're just in that and around all that and a part of that you don't it's hard to understand the depth of it i mean just think about this for a moment i believe every one of us as adults understand how corrupt and how immoral the government has been for years years all my life probably and more but now as it comes to this end time as it's waning itself closer to the time of our departure it's becoming more and more prevalent it's becoming more and more under the cover as you will back in the day it used to be uh that that they were just immoral and unethical and they were just a bunch of croats but they kind of did it to where the public didn't know anything about it they kind of did it the world only a few people would know or something would leak out here or something would leak out there and then they would come up and dismiss it as putting you down as a conspiracy theorist oh that's nothing to it they're just conspiracy theorists and then everybody changed that person when the truth of it is under the cover is absolutely true corrupt rotten to the core yes right but now they don't care right now they absolutely don't care i mean look and i i don't guess we're streaming this yes it's streaming i'll say it anyway the president of the united states will get up and lie right square to the american people and you know for an absolute fact that the man's lying and they don't care right they do not care right all the corruption and all the things that's coming out from under the cover they put it right in your face and they do not care right that's right and one of the big reasons they don't care is they know that most of the media will not even touch it right yeah they won't cover it they won't expose it they won't tell what the real truth really is the underlying theme of it friend it's it it's that rotten of a day our whole system brother adam said whole system from underneath us is rotten yep whole system is rotten man amen increase i didn't finish this quote here let me finish it he said just exactly like they did in sodom increase in crime how about today juvenile delinquency what hour are we living this day this word of prophecy is being fulfilled 60 uh 56 years ago over 56 years ago because that was february now where are we at today if that's the way it was then look at the it's brother branham talked about increase of crime what would brother brown say today with the increase of crime when a woman would just come in with a hat and a scarf and a and a mask on and just steal a woman's purse right out of her buggy and just walk out with it i've seen videos of people in california now they can steal up to a thousand dollars and walk out the door and you can't do a thing about it the law is on their side on the side of the criminal they got videos of people packing up bags of stuff and just walking out the door with it yeah what do you think he'd say today is he treats a crime in 1965 what do you think he'd say today with those things going on juvenile delinquency who's doing most of this juveniles some adults mostly young people stealing they don't care because they know that nobody else cares they know that nobody's going to do anything about it they know that the police aren't going to get there the one part of this story you don't know baby is that zach and tabitha called the police pinged her phone knew exactly where her phone was set in the starbucks it's at speedway uh and six waiting for four hours for the police to show up they never showed up five times five hours and the police never showed up a woman a policewoman drove around to get her a cup of coffee they're sitting there waiting for the police and a policewoman comes around to give her a cup of coffee so they ran out the door and flagged her down and said hey we need a police officer they finally went to the house and of course all she got her phone back but that's all they would it meant to they just found the phone in the parking lot somewhere you know so that's all they could admit to that's all they would admit to her give her back she got her phone back five hours they waited you know why i don't and i'm not i'm not faulting the police i'm faulting all the other stuff that goes on around here that just all that just gets pushed under the rug now yes it used to be when i drove when i was first started to drive a car if you didn't come to an absolute complete stop at a stop sign the police saw you you got a ticket i don't care if he is turning right or not they will give you a ticket right nowadays people don't must they hardly sometimes don't even break they just hit the gas when they turn right or or or even when the light turns red i've said it a traffic light yeah and and my light turned green and there's a three to five second delay between lights my light turned green and three more cars would go in front of us yeah oh yeah how red do you think their light had to be but it doesn't matter nobody does anything about it increase a crime it's on the rampage friend it pays to make sure you protect yourself watch out amen and uh and take care of yourself amen but that increase your crime is today it's where we're living right it's the days of sodom now i want to delve into this last part the days of luck eating and drinking we we know the homosexual but now let's look at the next part of this he said they eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it i thought well what is the big deal about that i buy and sell stuff i've had a house built i've planted trees but the reference here is so far removed from a simple act of life that we do that this that he was giving was something that was not just simply an act of living your life it this is a symbolic reference to people that were living their lives as if though there was no god right and that's the point that he's making here these people were living their lives as if though there was no god now that's the way a lot of people live their lives today now they'll tell you they believe in god they'll go to church they'll tell you they believe in jesus they'll tell you that they're saved but they live their lives like there is no god if they believed that there was a god then they would obey god's word right yes and that's the difference they lived their lives as though there is no god and the greater portion of the population of this world today live their lives as though there is no god and that there is no god working watching they devoted their entire lives to earthly things yes that's the way they live their lives they live their lives in devotion to earthly things buying selling building a planting building they live there their whole lives is consumed with the vanity of what they themselves can do what they themselves can accomplish who they themselves are rather than the fact that we are nothing but sheep led by the shepherd that our thoughts opinions feelings mean absolutely nothing outside of christ in his word amen but they're a group of people and i say group but the reference and lot to today the majority not just a group are living their lives as if though there is no god they live their lives as though god's not watching them that god knows everything that's going on makes me wonder about this santa claus business when they started that years ago the catholic church and the naughty list have you been good or bad the the what is however that christmas song they sing is it being good or bad to to try to keep kids in line oh the santa's watching santa's not watching nothing because there is no santa right but there's a god watching you there is an all-seeing eye that's watching you but people live as though that doesn't matter they don't care there's no god there they say that they believe him but they live their lives as though he's not right amen now let's go over to uh um the scripture here there's a couple of scriptures i want to read before we follow up with that in in genesis chapter 6 the scripture in genesis chapter 6 i'm just going to read one most of genesis 6 gives us the the foundation that we need in what jesus was saying as it was in the days of noah but verse 5 in my opinion mostly sums it up genesis 6 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually right the thought the imaginate look at look at this now not his words it's time to talk about his actions of course that that's just a result of what you're thinking the imagination of the thoughts not just your thoughts but the imagination of the thoughts were in their of their heart were evil continually no wonder god said if if every man's heart is imagination is evil continually no wonder he wiped it away amen it even repented god that he made man but he saw in noah man that walked with god that we talked about last week right a man that walked with god and god found grace and as god as noah began to preach the word his family believed and when it was time the boat was the ark was done the those that believed his message went in the ark and were saved from the from the judgment right amen the rest were destroyed but that's the the characteristic of noah's day the wickedness of man was great and the imagination of every thought was evil continually now let's look at lot and now a lot you can go back and read it if you like chapter 19 in genesis is a very uh very descriptive about the days of lot and and the angels going down there and all the things that unfolded but invert but in chapter 13 genesis 13 there's one verse that to me summed it up one verse just like in the andalusian world here with lot genesis 13 13 but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly and look at where you find this about sodom you find it in 1313 what did brother brown say the number of the united states was number 13. this is genesis 13 verse 13 where the wickedness of solomon so have we returned back to sodom again amen oh i think if god doesn't destroy this today he'll have to raise sodom and gomorrah and apologize right forsaking them believe to see amen that's the truth now let's go over to ecclesiastes chapter we're going to begin reading in chapter 2. and i want to finish this up with that thought of vanity you ever ready collegiate ecclesiastes yes well the beginning of ecclesiastes is the pat's last name you ever thought of that echoes e-c-c-l-e-s echols that's ecclesiastes that's their name ecclesiastes if you read ecclesiastes you know it means the preacher or or the preacher and and he spends a lot of time speaking about vanity talking about vanity and when i saw this about the the the building and the the planting and and and all the the frivolous way that people were living their lives i i believe that's why you see such an increased home and homelessness too the way people the the way people live their lives today they just don't care we went by we now now you know what's everywhere but this just struck me me and brother roger were coming from a job at grant and silverbell we were coming west on grant got right to the interstate and got on the interpa the underpass to turn left to get up on the interstate and it was a woman homeless ladies that corner is full of homeless people normally but she was sitting there after people were working their corners she was sitting there underneath the shade next to the the wall uh and around her was just it's like she had taken a section of the landfill and put it around her yeah and she was just sitting in the middle of garbage filth nastiness i i really felt sorry for the woman probably self-inflicted a lot of wounds today are self-inflicted i i don't i don't feel less sorry for self-inflicted wounds because they're still wounds yeah but when they're self-inflicted there's a limited amount of things you can really do right yeah you i could have gave her 10 bucks and she had about 10 more dollars worth of trash to put around her be it a cup from circle k or a candy bar wrapper or an empty bag of chips or something it's just 10 more dollars worth of trash around her unfortunately but it's the it's the flippant nature it's the disregard for the really for the sanctity of life and i that that's very strong but i feel very strong about that a lot of people have a very uh a passive nature about the gift of life right about the uh about the fact that god has blessed you with a day to live to have a life to to feed yourself and to work and enjoy life and have a family and and do things that life can afford you children grandchildren and a family and and live your life have a little money see another part of the country or world go on a little vacation have something a little extra whatever not over indulgence of course but you know god blesses us and we're thankful for that but just something but it's it's just an attitude really for the lack of appreciation for the fact that these people are alive if they felt that they would they wouldn't live that way my opinion now some i understand some uh there's mental issues and some drug abuse issues and alcoholic issues and things like that and uh but to me friend that we should take care of people who can't take care of themselves mentally we should take care of people who are uh who are hooked on there should be there should be facilities and places they can go if they're hooked on drugs or alcohol yeah there should be a place for the veterans there should be a single homeless veteran in this country anywhere period if you're a veteran we should take care of you because you took care of us that's my opinion now people now most of the group that's left is just people who don't care and they just they just live that way because they want to they just don't care they want to be homeless they don't want any responsibility they don't want to have to be told what to do they don't want to have to get up and go to a job every morning they don't want those things so they just live the way they live and i'm sorry but those again are self-inflicted wounds amen but now ecclesiastes building on that thought ecclesiastes the vanity the living your life uh as as though there is no god ecclesiastes two and one i said in mine heart now i'm gonna stop there because that's a very profound few words if you go and you look in the scripture just at those four words uh five words i said in my heart now when uh when that scripture is written when those words are said it's in reference to someone who is completely self-reliant and does not believe or trust in any god i've said in my heart what is the one place in the bible i'm going to test you you can answer this if you want there is no wrong answer but i have something specific in my mind the one specific place that comes to mind when you hear that i said in my heart what do you think about there is no god in the scripture there is no god anybody else to give any place when it says i said in my heart who else said in his heart something huh there we go isaiah 14 and in isaiah 14 verse 12 it said how are thou fallen from heaven o loose for son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which this week in the nation for thou has said in thine heart talking about lucifer satan thou has said in thy heart well friend i don't want to do anything in any way that would be a replication of something about the devil when it says he said in his heart i don't ever want to say anything in my heart you understand because this reference of the devil he has said in his heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mouth of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high satan himself has said in his heart so when you read it in ecclesiastes it begins with the phrase i said in my heart that is not a good beginning right that is a very self-serving selfish self-reliant attitude words there's another one that said that amen that's that's very prominent that we know of i'll read it to you and it's in several of the gospels but in saint luke chapter 12 verse 19 rich young ruler and i will say to my soul amen rich young ruler i will say to my soul soul thou has much goods laid up for many years take thine ease drink eat drink and be merry amen the same attitude the same disregarding attitude jesus gave spoke of specifically about the days of life right building planting living your life as though there is no god let's finish ecclesiastes i said in my heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth that's with with joy gaiety i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity now what did brother branham say the spirit of america was frolic yes that's what he said amen i said i said of laughter it is mad and of joy mirth what doeth it i saw in my heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom or that is acquainting or resisting pushing away pushing away mine heart with wisdom so he doesn't want wisdom and to lay hold on to folly or foolishness so he's rejecting wisdom and embracing foolishness right till i might see what was the good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life i made me i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them all of all kinds of fruits i made me pools of water to water where there with the wood that bringeth forth trees i got me servants maids and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of provinces i got me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts so i was great and increased more than all there were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me and shall i say their humility as well my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever my eyes declared i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy from my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and all the labors that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun live their lives as though there was no god right now i counted i don't know how this stood out to you but as i read this again this morning it stood out to me and i counted how many times in 11 verses he uses the word i yeah i 20 times in 11 verses the personal pronoun i was used that's shocking in 11 verses now that's not self-serving i don't know what it is i mean that's just that's just somebody who's completely dependent on themselves self-reliant egotistical don't care anything about god or the world that live their lives however they want to they're going to give their not deny their heart of any pleasure at all everything that they do they're going to do for themselves they're going to do it for the gain of themselves forget about whether it's helping somebody else that's not significant it's got to be something that's going to profit me or i'm not going to do it self-serving self-editifying living their lives as though there is no god but i want to give you another one i'm closing 20 eyes in 11 verses but guess how many how many other personal pronouns are in that same 11 verses 24 personal pronouns me let's see mine me my mine myself 24 personal pronouns outside of the 20 eyes so in 11 verses now this ain't a good lesson friend in 11 verses 44 personal pronouns in 11 verses 44. now that's somebody that's egotistical self-serving doesn't care about anybody or anything else planting building living their lives is as though there was no god and that's the way the world is today right notice the far majority of people today oh you say oh there's all kinds of uh of nonprofits that help homeless people and help people that need assistance and all these things i wonder now i i don't i don't want to question this the sincerity of anybody i don't want to put words in anybody's mouth or or define anybody's heart's desire but i wonder how many of that of those people and that money would be given if it wasn't tax deductible right what does tax deduction do it gives them a benefit amen right and a lot of people say well instead of giving it to the government i'm just going to give it to this organization well are they really giving it of their heart if that's the attitude again i'm not going to question anybody's motive but if that's the attitude they're giving it because it profits them self-serving look at the world today you see it you can see it on the streets it's being taught to our children you see it prominently in the world today self-serving and and it's a spirit that's prevalent to the world and it's no wonder that the general populace doesn't have a trust in in churches and ministry today it's no wonder christianity has lost so many people over to buddhism and and and and uh all the other things other religions in the world yeah what is the what is the greatest portion of the mainstream christianity got to offer for the regular person today it's sad you go and see these big personal pop of personalities on tv and one guy is saying he needs to buy another jet he's already got four and another guy's streaming from his 12 million dollar mansion yeah it reminds me of brother branham when somebody tried to give him a cadillac he said how could i drive a catalog how could i take that car and drive up to a sick poor person's house and try to offer prayer for them now does that mean that god won't hear brother graham's prayer no but does it mean that that person he's going to may have a little less confidence because this guy is coming in with a thousand dollar suit and a 50 80 000 car that's why brother brain said i couldn't do it right now brother brown drove new cars there's nothing that but you understand my point right and it's no wonder that people's lives it's self-serving everything becomes self-serving yes when when everything about ministry is to serve not be self-serving it's to give yes i mean it it does my heart go when i hear the testimonies and like sister julian thanks for the support and the text and the love and the pouring out and everything and that that means a lot today yeah you're giving of yourself and you're giving of yourself not expecting anything in return amen i mean the thanks and appreciation is very nice and and thankful for that but you don't do it to expect anything right it's just like when you give as unto the lord see everything you do you do is unto the lord yes amen every we we sometimes lose sight of that you know sometimes i have to remind myself when it's 105 degrees outside my back is burning and my and my arms are hurting and digging a ditch and i'm thinking lord this next shovel's for you amen amen this next this next uh uh picking the ground is for you i'm not doing it for roger i'm not doing it for electrical business i'm not doing it for the uh for the customer i'm doing it as unto the lord amen sisters every time you turn on the stove you do it as unto the lord yes every single meal you make you're making for christ yeah you saw i'm tired of doing this and and my husband or my children or whatever you're doing it for god yes every time you punch that clock you punch it for jesus every witness that you do every text you give every good word that you speak every encouragement you give you do it as unto the lord yes amen now we do it with wisdom when you live your life for others you're staring heaven in the face yes not 44 pronouns and 11 they're personal pronouns and 11 verses amen it's all about him yes it's not about me it's not about i and that's what the days of life that's what jesus was talking about that's exactly what he was talking about and friend i'm here to tell you this is the rapture part 14. we're seeing it prevalent all around us everywhere today i i see very few pockets of of of individuals and or even groups or churches that don't operate under that premise it becomes about my foreign no more oh come to our church we're the only one that's got it that's just the same attitude friend that's the same spirit and it doesn't work that way it doesn't work with me and i believe the fact that you're here means it doesn't work with you either amen but we live our lives as unto the lord everything we do we do it for christ every every word every imagination every thought every word we do it as unto the lord yes amen which is the absolute contrast of what's going on in the world today yeah everything's self-serving yes when i first started driving um i first started here but back in north carolina well even here at that time you know in 1985 86 in the mid-80s you pull up to a a light and if or if you were trying to come out of a parking lot people pulled up the light people would let you out yeah sometimes you gotta wait two two and two and three light cycles or just pull out in front of somebody before you get out because nobody lets you out every once in a while i run across some that do but it's fairly rare anymore cut you off pull in front of you basically because they just want to be first i don't know i guess maybe their favorite episode of the flintstones is on or something i don't know but but it can't be because they're in that big a hurry because you pull right up behind it but the next traffic light it's just to get in front of you yeah it's that spirit it's that attitude me first in a lot of cases me only yeah and it's it's it's grip the world it's taken over amen and you can see it i i can come up with another 100 examples do you know what i'm talking about you see it tick tock and all that stuff all that it just encourages all that stuff yes amen self edification look at me and that's what it's become as it was in the days of lot that's exactly what it was in the days of life yes that prevailing spirit me first and god sunk them now what's going to happen to this world amen i don't know well i do know but i know what's going on to the bride and she's getting ready to go home amen amen praise the lord you ready yeah ready to go home let's stand if we could ready for home amen this world's not my home just traveling through yes amen you love the lord jesus yes praise the lord amen god is so good to us isn't he amen let's sing this little chorus i know it's a psalm but it only has the chorus in the psalm book but number 560 what will it be amen oh saints what will it be amen eyes not seniors not heard never entered in the heart of man what god's got in store for us we got a little glimpse of it through a prophet and god took beyond the curtain of time and came back and told us of the report so we got a little bit of knowledge about it but oh it's gonna just the atmosphere and the spirit and the feeling it's gonna be to be there it's gonna be far beyond to think oh my family's gonna be there yeah that's nice and great but just to think about just the the presence the atmosphere the feeling that's going to be in that spirit you won't feel the oppression of laodicea and those demonic devils pressing on you all the time amen praise the lord jesus what will it be [Music] upon the glassy sea we'll join our loved ones and crown christ forever [Music] [Applause] means to [Music] and join the throng [Music] [Applause] [Music] forever this is just whatever it means to me one more time now what will it be when we get over yonder [Music] we'll join our loved ones [Music] hallelujah what is it going to be saints praise the lord may not be able to exactly explain it but i sure am looking forward to it amen praise the lord amen god be good to you enjoy your life you thank god for life thank god for life i don't want to take it for granted saints don't take a second of it for granted don't take one moment not even one time to gather together don't take anything for granted thank god for the life he's given us amen we don't know friend there's one of us may not be here next week we don't know the way god's taking people home you know we just never know but i want to take every moment that i can amen and appreciate what god's done for me give to me every one of you amen those who may be part of our extended family of friends amen i'm so thankful and i appreciate the lord jesus amen but there is one guarantee friend nothing in this life is but one guarantee amen there will be a great gathering on the other side i plan to be there yes you plan to be there you got your ticket amen got my ticket called the holy ghost amen praise the lord love you appreciate each one of you continue remember the prayer requests we had today he managed with several of them of course some that's uh lost loved ones and friends and i got a good friend back in north carolina just passed away a few weeks ago and like i said there's been several others and and you know we talk about covert a lot but you know not all has been coping actually probably half of the ones i know of have not been because they've been something else probably half have been coping but um but i'm so thankful that there is a god he loves us amen
