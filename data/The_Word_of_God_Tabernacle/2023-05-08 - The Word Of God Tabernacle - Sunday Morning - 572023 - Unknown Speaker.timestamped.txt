[1:02:41] here left I said I know
[1:02:43] and he said you know your your place is
[1:02:46] you're probably getting half the rent
[1:02:47] what I could get from and I said I know
[1:02:49] I said but but look at the places full I
[1:02:52] said the place is full because we're
[1:02:54] here
[1:02:56] he looked at me crazy but he said yeah
[1:02:59] yeah I said I prayed the Lord blessed
[1:03:01] you to fill the place up outside of this
[1:03:04] one here of course but I said I pray the
[1:03:07] Lord bless you once we came in there
[1:03:10] there it is you ever gone in a
[1:03:11] restaurant and there's nobody there and
[1:03:14] and 10 minutes later there's 30 people
[1:03:16] yes you ever go to some you know place
[1:03:19] like that and there's nobody there and
[1:03:21] then all of a sudden the whole place is
[1:03:23] full of people
[1:03:28] God knows his own
[1:03:32] anybody else
[1:03:34] when brother Branham went to the

[1:03:41] of people yeah and then he went there

[1:04:10] read a few verses of scripture here in
[1:04:12] first Timothy chapter six to start
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:18] simple thought the lord gave me the
[1:04:20] other day kind of followed up with the
[1:04:22] contending for the faith
[1:04:24] um
[1:04:25] but take a little bit of a different
[1:04:28] avenue if you will
[1:04:31] amen First Timothy chapter six
[1:04:35] we're going to begin reading with with
[1:04:37] verse six
[1:04:39] but before we do good with our heads
[1:04:41] forward a prayer and Lord Jesus
[1:04:44] father you are reality God you are
[1:04:47] everything to us
[1:04:49] people may not know it Lord we may not

[1:04:56] hear you audibly but Lord you are
[1:04:59] reality you're here for us yes in every
[1:05:02] way God and we know that because we
[1:05:05] recognize it and we see it at every term
[1:05:08] Lord from the testimony of brother and
[1:05:10] sister Pat to the testimony of brother
[1:05:12] Dennis and brother Danny and Lord how
[1:05:14] you were with him in that car God and
[1:05:16] how many testimonies we've heard
[1:05:18] recently Lord yes just over the days
[1:05:20] over the years over the weeks God your
[1:05:23] reality because we know that your
[1:05:25] reality we know that you're there how
[1:05:28] many times that Lord just in the
[1:05:29] Simplicity of getting into a situation
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:33] a little thought a little prayer a
[1:05:36] little something to you Lord God just

[1:05:54] passing out Lord just you're just so
[1:05:58] good to his father we thank you so much
[1:06:00] and I just I wanna I wanna automatize
[1:06:04] those things so that we hear them and
[1:06:06] that we recognize God even as the
[1:06:08] testimonies go forth that how faithful
[1:06:10] you are to us Lord the world would look
[1:06:13] upon this probably even some Christians
[1:06:15] maybe even some message people will look
[1:06:17] in this little assembly and not think
[1:06:19] much about it but Lord the things that
[1:06:21] you do for us God oh Lord just in this
[1:06:25] little group of people father how you're
[1:06:27] so faithful to us how you bless us and
[1:06:29] you walk with us and you watch over us
[1:06:31] and you strengthen us oh God how you
[1:06:34] visit us in our services Lord and you're
[1:06:37] never failing the Lord we just thank you
[1:06:39] and praise you for all that you do for
[1:06:41] us Lord and for here today in this
[1:06:43] desire to come to this place Lord we
[1:06:46] thank you for it Lord and we've had many
[1:06:48] requests here today we've got some
[1:06:50] Financial situations and difficulties
[1:06:53] father but Lord we know that you on the
[1:06:55] cattle in a thousand hills there's
[1:06:57] nothing God that you can't do and Lord
[1:07:00] we're just praise your faithfulness
[1:07:01] would continue to extend Lord It's hand
[1:07:04] to each one of us and for your blessings
[1:07:07] and watching over us sometimes we know
[1:07:09] you put us in situations to teach us a
[1:07:12] lesson sometimes you direct us in places
[1:07:15] things we might not be doing that we
[1:07:17] should do my things that we shouldn't do
[1:07:20] that we should not do or whatever it is
[1:07:22] Lord you lead us and guide us in some
[1:07:25] ways that we just don't understand but
[1:07:27] as we call Upon Your Name Lord may we
[1:07:29] learn whatever it may be you're trying
[1:07:31] to teach us God to draw us call Closer
[1:07:34] to You Lord I pray now that you have
[1:07:36] complete control of the main part of
[1:07:38] this service may your Holy Spirit move
[1:07:40] in a special way now God to speak
[1:07:42] through these lips to anoint our ears to
[1:07:45] accomplish that through this service
[1:07:47] what you'd have to be accomplished today
[1:07:49] Lord you're the only one that can do it
[1:07:52] and we just pray that it will not return
[1:07:54] void let it be today we rebuke every
[1:07:57] demonic spirit that would try to hurt
[1:07:58] hinder and filtrate this service in any
[1:08:00] way that you get all the glory honor and
[1:08:03] praise for all that is said and done in
[1:08:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:08:07] pray amen amen
[1:08:09] amen First Timothy chapter 6 verse 6.
[1:08:13] it says but godliness with contentment
[1:08:15] is great gain
[1:08:18] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:08:20] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[1:08:22] out
[1:08:23] and having food and arraignment let us
[1:08:26] be there with content
[1:08:28] but they that will be rich fall into
[1:08:30] temptation and a snare and into many
[1:08:33] foolish and hurtful lusts which drown
[1:08:36] men in destruction and perdition
[1:08:39] For the Love of Money is the root of all
[1:08:43] evil which while some covet actor they
[1:08:46] have aired from the faith and pierced
[1:08:49] himself through with many sorrows
[1:08:52] let thou o man of God flee these things
[1:08:55] and follow after righteousness godliness
[1:08:59] Faith love patience meekness fight the
[1:09:02] good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal
[1:09:06] life where unto Thou Art also called and
[1:09:09] has professed a good profession before
[1:09:11] many witnesses you could be seated if
[1:09:14] you'd like
[1:09:16] when I take the subject on that last
[1:09:18] verse that entire reading of course is
[1:09:21] quite uh quite an extensible an
[1:09:25] extensive teaching but I want to take
[1:09:26] the last the last verse the little bit
[1:09:29] of that last verse and we were talking
[1:09:31] about contending for the faith that
[1:09:34] contention is is sort of the same it's
[1:09:38] not the same Greek word but it sort of
[1:09:40] falls in the same family in in the uh in
[1:09:44] the subtext of fighting the good fight
[1:09:47] uh my context though however was when
[1:09:50] contending for the faith was a lot about
[1:09:52] what we deal with in the Life uh and
[1:09:55] from others and and uh from those that
[1:09:59] would come in unawares as the Bible said
[1:10:01] and try to sow Discord and things like
[1:10:04] that but this fight is going to be
[1:10:07] directly at the Devil amen directly at
[1:10:11] the devil that the Lord tells us here to
[1:10:13] fight the good fight now what's the good
[1:10:15] fight it's the good fight of Faith it's
[1:10:18] amazing that Michael just put it in on
[1:10:21] that song every verse every line he sang
[1:10:24] out of the song I'm looking at it and
[1:10:26] I'm singing it and I'm thinking my
[1:10:27] that's just exactly what the Lord had
[1:10:30] put on my heart to preach for today
[1:10:32] actually I originally had had this to
[1:10:35] speak last week uh but for some reason I
[1:10:38] was I was standing there and uh going
[1:10:40] through it uh the Lord changed and put
[1:10:43] the sermon in for last week and this for
[1:10:45] this week and God knows everything but
[1:10:47] as I was listening to the lines as he
[1:10:49] was singing I thought mine this is
[1:10:51] exactly what the Lord had to bring today
[1:10:53] fighting the good fight of Fate now the
[1:10:56] fight that we have uh that we are very
[1:11:00] Christians are considered a very docile
[1:11:02] uh group of people uh we're we're a
[1:11:06] group of people that's considered a
[1:11:08] group a group of people more of Love uh
[1:11:11] than a fighting uh however there is in
[1:11:15] the scripture although that we are a
[1:11:18] people of love but we are a people of
[1:11:20] God's love we're not a people of the
[1:11:22] world's love uh we do have filio love we
[1:11:25] do express filial love but our love that
[1:11:27] sets us apart from the world is our
[1:11:30] agape love the love of God yes and
[1:11:32] that's the love of God that's shine
[1:11:34] abroad in our hearts that we to express
[1:11:37] to the world they don't understand that
[1:11:39] kind of love uh but that's the kind of
[1:11:41] love that God's people have but this
[1:11:44] this fighting of the good fight there's
[1:11:46] also scripture about us contending and
[1:11:50] about us fighting uh the problem is a
[1:11:53] lot of times in Christians even in the
[1:11:55] message people tend to train their fight
[1:11:59] on one another instead of on the enemy
[1:12:01] uh they they blame one another they
[1:12:04] fight one another or they contend with
[1:12:06] one another and as far as being
[1:12:08] destructive there's a place that we take
[1:12:12] that's under the auspice of this agape
[1:12:14] love that brings us to the place of
[1:12:17] fighting that's why I believe Paul wrote
[1:12:20] this to Timothy as the good fight amen
[1:12:24] the good fight a lot of fights that take
[1:12:27] place that you look in the world
[1:12:29] 99 of the fights that happen whether
[1:12:34] it's verbal whether it's fisticuffs
[1:12:36] whether it's fighting uh battle
[1:12:39] something it's usually a fight of anger
[1:12:41] it's usually a fight of malice and
[1:12:45] jealousy uh the the killings and all of
[1:12:50] hatred and Malice but the fight that
[1:12:52] that Paul is encouraging us to fight is
[1:12:56] a good fight amen a good fight to fight
[1:12:59] of course is to strive or contest
[1:13:02] you're contesting for something you're
[1:13:04] not necessarily wanting to Pummel
[1:13:07] somebody because you hate them you
[1:13:09] although that probably would pertain to
[1:13:12] the devil I I don't mind at all
[1:13:14] pummeling him but
[1:13:16] but we'll find out as we know later as
[1:13:19] we probably already all know uh it's not
[1:13:21] a fight or a fist anyway amen our
[1:13:24] Warfare is not of this carnal our
[1:13:26] forefares of the uh of the spirit realm
[1:13:29] but so many times we train our fighting
[1:13:33] on one another
[1:13:35] we fight each other instead of instead
[1:13:37] of the one that's uh that's trying to
[1:13:40] cause the conflict the one that's trying
[1:13:43] to cause the contention the one that's
[1:13:45] trying to bring the division and that's
[1:13:47] the devil and that's where our fights
[1:13:49] should be trained to but even in our
[1:13:51] fight there we we are to give to fight a
[1:13:54] good fight amen a good fight striving
[1:13:58] contesting but good if you look at the
[1:14:01] word good for just a moment is to be
[1:14:04] honest
[1:14:05] or honorable
[1:14:07] to be good as honest or honorable even
[1:14:10] the Rich Young Ruler came to Jesus and G
[1:14:13] and a Rich Young Ruler said good master
[1:14:16] and and Jesus even looked at the Rich
[1:14:19] Young Ruler and said why do you call me
[1:14:21] good there is none good but God
[1:14:24] so if that puts in perspective
[1:14:26] scripturally what the word good means
[1:14:29] that we can understand the good fight
[1:14:32] the good fight of Faith holding on to
[1:14:36] the things that we know are right and
[1:14:38] are true because look friend you know
[1:14:41] and it has been prayed here and
[1:14:44] mentioned here today Satan is after
[1:14:46] every single facet of your life of
[1:14:50] godliness that he can get to he's trying
[1:14:53] to rob you and take from you every
[1:14:56] single thing that God daily is trying to
[1:14:58] give to you very much amen and even he
[1:15:01] wrote the foundation out from under that
[1:15:05] statue of a perfect man which is faith
[1:15:08] that's why we're the fight The Honorable
[1:15:11] fight of Faith The Honorable fight that
[1:15:15] that we stand and know that it's that
[1:15:18] fight that God gives us to fight for our
[1:15:20] faith so what we're doing is
[1:15:22] we're trying to hold on to that that
[1:15:25] belongs to us that that is ours that
[1:15:27] that is the foundation of our of our
[1:15:31] fundamental beliefs as Christians as as
[1:15:34] Faith to fight for that Faith because
[1:15:37] every single day Satan is robbing in
[1:15:41] this Satan's Eden people of their faith
[1:15:45] everything about this world today is to
[1:15:49] take Faith away from you yeah
[1:15:51] you to to to make everything so easy and
[1:15:55] so accessible right and so uh abundant
[1:15:59] that it takes the faith away now I I'm
[1:16:03] not praying asking and looking that we
[1:16:06] become uh broke poffers that are
[1:16:09] homeless I'm not talking about that uh
[1:16:13] but look we we have plenty of food in
[1:16:15] our cupboards
[1:16:17] we probably have at least some money in
[1:16:19] our bank accounts we have vehicles that
[1:16:21] we drive we have a nice place of worship
[1:16:24] the Lord give us we have a roof over our
[1:16:26] heads we have clothes on our backs uh I
[1:16:30] I don't look at anybody that's starving
[1:16:32] uh if you are let me know I'll I'll make
[1:16:35] sure that doesn't happen but God has
[1:16:38] blessed us so when it becomes in such an
[1:16:41] abundant uh accessibility it it loses
[1:16:45] its uh its
[1:16:48] it's faith that we need to hold on to uh
[1:16:53] we had medical insurance we have doctors
[1:16:55] we have hospitals and we have a medicine
[1:16:58] cabinets and and Tylenol and and Advil
[1:17:02] and and ibuprofen and and
[1:17:05] omeprazole and stuff for almost
[1:17:08] everything
[1:17:09] but it comes down to that place that we
[1:17:12] hold on to that faith and fight for that
[1:17:15] Faith every day to believe because
[1:17:16] there's so many other variables in life
[1:17:19] that calls for our faith to be able to
[1:17:22] sustain itself to believe for ourselves
[1:17:26] just like the uh the the testimonies we
[1:17:29] heard today
[1:17:30] uh just like the testimonies we've heard
[1:17:32] over the past few weeks about crying out
[1:17:36] to God and asking believing in faith to
[1:17:38] God that God answers that prayer God
[1:17:41] answers that Faith it's the faith that
[1:17:44] God answers you know that remember we've
[1:17:47] talked about faith many times it's the
[1:17:49] faith that God answers God will answer
[1:17:51] Faith even in Heathen if he's got faith
[1:17:54] yeah amen it's the faith that moves the
[1:17:57] hand of God you say well how can that be
[1:18:00] well how if we know that God is the only
[1:18:04] healer and an atheist gets sick and then
[1:18:07] healed who healed it
[1:18:10] there had to be some Faith there
[1:18:12] somewhere brother Adam said that God
[1:18:14] won't even hear the prayer of a
[1:18:15] bald-haired woman
[1:18:17] so how does she get healed how do things
[1:18:20] like this happen because of the faith
[1:18:23] the unmerited faith and Satan is trying
[1:18:26] to rob that from you yes Satan is trying
[1:18:29] in every way to steal that Faith from
[1:18:32] you that's why we must be more astute
[1:18:35] today must be more aware today than ever
[1:18:39] of those little things that Satan keeps
[1:18:41] trying to creep in on us to take that
[1:18:43] from you
[1:18:44] amen Satan is trying to rob it from you
[1:18:47] Saints look it's a it's a good fight of
[1:18:50] faith
[1:18:52] it's a good fight that keeps us look
[1:18:54] what the scripture says in Saint John
[1:18:56] uh Saint John chapter 10.
[1:19:01] Saint John chapter 10 verse 10.
[1:19:04] the thief cometh not
[1:19:06] but for to steal
[1:19:09] and to kill and to destroy so the enemy
[1:19:14] Satan not your brother or sister now not
[1:19:18] the neighboring sister Church
[1:19:20] but the enemy the thief Satan has come
[1:19:25] for one thing
[1:19:27] and that's to still kill and destroy
[1:19:31] you notice how the scripture wrote this
[1:19:33] he said the thief cometh not but to
[1:19:37] that's the reason he's here
[1:19:39] that's why the thief is here the thief
[1:19:42] is here to steal from you the thief is
[1:19:45] here to kill you to destroy you and look
[1:19:49] at these uh these adjectives that that
[1:19:53] Jesus is bringing each one of these is a
[1:19:56] part of the Ten Commandments Thou shalt
[1:19:58] not steal right Thou shalt not kill
[1:20:00] destroy amen Thou shalt not in the
[1:20:03] Beatitudes
[1:20:04] Jesus teaches the exact same thing but
[1:20:07] what does the thief come to do what a
[1:20:10] Satan come to at the exact opposite now
[1:20:14] will will the enemy work through
[1:20:17] individuals to try to do this absolutely
[1:20:19] will the enemy try to put people in your
[1:20:22] way put people in your life to try to
[1:20:25] get you to the place that this that this
[1:20:28] Faith becomes eroded in your life
[1:20:30] absolutely he will because he'll use any
[1:20:32] means possible to
[1:20:36] to rob from you to steal from you
[1:20:40] anything that God is trying to bring to
[1:20:43] you anything that you have from God even
[1:20:46] if you have it that you've got that
[1:20:48] God's gave to you Satan wants to take it
[1:20:50] from you right Amen to steal and to kill
[1:20:55] you
[1:20:56] so that you become destroyed before the
[1:20:58] Lord
[1:20:59] that's his purpose
[1:21:01] that's what he does
[1:21:03] amen and he's really good at it I'll
[1:21:06] give him those uh I'll give him those
[1:21:08] accolades he's good at it he's good at
[1:21:11] killing he's good at stealing he's good
[1:21:14] at destroying lives yes he is
[1:21:17] yeah and it's becoming more evident
[1:21:19] every day
[1:21:20] but see we're to fight the good fight
[1:21:23] amen The Honorable fight amen contend
[1:21:28] to to strive and contest
[1:21:31] so when he comes to try to take it from
[1:21:33] you no Satan you don't belong here get
[1:21:36] thee behind me Satan you have no place
[1:21:38] here
[1:21:39] amen is to rob from the true word
[1:21:44] the true word that God has delivered to
[1:21:47] you because remember what brings faith
[1:21:50] hearing hearing the word of God brings
[1:21:53] Faith so what's he doing
[1:21:55] even if it's something so subtle as to
[1:21:59] trying to pervert the word of God as as
[1:22:02] a minister would or seminary or
[1:22:05] something to try to add to take away to
[1:22:08] try to pervert the word in some way to
[1:22:10] try to hybridize the word in some way is
[1:22:13] to try to steal
[1:22:15] is to try to steal it robbed from you to
[1:22:18] destroy you just like in the Garden of
[1:22:20] Eden just like what happened with Eve in
[1:22:23] the Garden of Eden
[1:22:24] what did he do he did the exact same
[1:22:26] thing he took the word from her
[1:22:29] he perverted the word
[1:22:32] Satan continuously and don't think for a
[1:22:35] moment that Satan says back it's all
[1:22:37] there Christian there's no use in trying
[1:22:39] to get to them anymore uh you Devils
[1:22:43] over there don't worry about those
[1:22:44] people they're they're too far gone
[1:22:46] there's no way you can influence them
[1:22:48] absolutely not
[1:22:50] he'll never do that thing don't ever
[1:22:54] think that he won't always send his
[1:22:56] little demonic minions out your way to
[1:22:59] continually sum out maybe so we always
[1:23:02] think about this big huge Dynamic of
[1:23:05] Satan coming in and trying to destroy
[1:23:08] just all he cares about is just we can
[1:23:11] just get a little foothold if he gets
[1:23:13] even just get the little pinky toe in
[1:23:15] there to try to divide her to cause a
[1:23:18] wedge of some kind that's all he just
[1:23:19] just to try to wedge and get in there
[1:23:22] somehow to try to get you away from what
[1:23:25] you know is right
[1:23:27] for what you know is real then that's
[1:23:29] the world today he's here to kill uh uh
[1:23:32] steal and destroy that's his purpose he
[1:23:36] does everything in in every way to try
[1:23:38] to get us to that place now first
[1:23:40] Timothy back to First Timothy again
[1:23:50] try to Rob
[1:23:52] the world uh the the word from you
[1:23:57] to try to take from you that that God's
[1:24:00] give you to help build things
[1:24:03] because we we have to be as brother
[1:24:05] Dennis said earlier today we have to be
[1:24:08] as we're at these end times at the place
[1:24:10] of a building of Faith an increasing of
[1:24:14] faith amen the world is working hard as
[1:24:18] we read as Paul told Timothy the world
[1:24:21] is working so hard to try to build
[1:24:24] wealth
[1:24:25] and to build Fame and to build power and
[1:24:29] to build all these worldly things that
[1:24:31] will end up in rubble that'll mean
[1:24:33] absolutely nothing one day uh you look
[1:24:36] at Major catastrophes and and people of
[1:24:39] the rich the the rich people you know
[1:24:42] once that money is stripped away once
[1:24:45] their life is Stripped Away what do they
[1:24:47] have
[1:24:48] means nothing anymore
[1:24:50] but what we strive for is to establish
[1:24:54] and to gain the things that that that
[1:24:56] bring us into that Heavenly place that
[1:24:59] is their waiting for our Treasures is
[1:25:02] stored up in heaven waiting for us when
[1:25:04] we get there
[1:25:06] that's what we store up not the things
[1:25:09] you worry about of in this world the
[1:25:12] Lord will take care of us absolutely the
[1:25:14] Lord will bless us here absolutely but
[1:25:16] not to worry about building some kind of
[1:25:18] a kingdom here
[1:25:19] we're looking for that that God give us
[1:25:21] for the other side amen building that
[1:25:24] faith
[1:25:25] building that faith is by hearing and
[1:25:28] hearing the word of God yes the pure
[1:25:30] word of God not just any word not just
[1:25:33] any Ministry or any
[1:25:36] hybridization of the word or or anything
[1:25:39] like but the pure word of God for the
[1:25:42] hour for the day that we live now yes
[1:25:44] that we know that came through that
[1:25:45] message amen that made this Bible a new
[1:25:48] book
[1:25:49] Satan's come to rob that from you Satan
[1:25:52] has come to try to steal it from you
[1:25:54] must fight
[1:25:55] to continue to maintain that that God
[1:25:58] has given to you amen number one thing
[1:26:01] he tries mostly to steal from you is
[1:26:03] your time
[1:26:05] amen there's 24 hours in a day God's
[1:26:09] give us and it's the same every single
[1:26:11] day 24 hours and if Satan can keep us so
[1:26:14] busy that we never have time for
[1:26:16] anything else that he's then he has
[1:26:18] already begun to steal
[1:26:21] amen he's already begun to steal
[1:26:25] steal your time
[1:26:27] amen but now look uh first Timothy I had
[1:26:30] to turn first Timothy chapter one uh
[1:26:33] let's begin with verse 18. look at this
[1:26:36] now going back to the word now remember
[1:26:38] the building of Faith the word building
[1:26:41] in us for this last day it's got to
[1:26:44] build
[1:26:45] there's got to be a faith building in
[1:26:47] The Bride for a Rapture to take place
[1:26:49] for a body change there's got to be a
[1:26:51] building of Faith amen
[1:26:54] this uh this charge I commit unto thee
[1:26:57] son Timothy according to the prophecies
[1:27:00] which went before on thee that thou by
[1:27:04] them might as wore a good Warfare now
[1:27:09] he's talking about Paul talking about
[1:27:11] the prophecy that had gone over and was
[1:27:13] spoke over Timothy that that would bring
[1:27:17] Timothy to this place that he is to
[1:27:20] fulfill this position in his life that
[1:27:23] he used to fulfill and to war to fight
[1:27:26] that good fights the same word here that
[1:27:29] good fight that good Warfare God has
[1:27:33] given him that is something that
[1:27:35] stabilizes now look holding what
[1:27:38] faith
[1:27:40] holding Faith praise the Lord and uh and
[1:27:45] a good conscience which some having put
[1:27:49] away concerning Faith have made
[1:27:52] shipwreck Satan has come in and stole
[1:27:56] this from them Satan has come in and
[1:27:59] robbed them of this what this Faith his
[1:28:03] encouragement was holding faith
[1:28:06] hold on to this faith and stay steady
[1:28:10] and stable fight war against anyone
[1:28:14] anything that would try to take that and
[1:28:16] Rob that from you
[1:28:18] every day
[1:28:20] amen amen every day
[1:28:23] that's what to say that's what the
[1:28:24] devil's doing
[1:28:26] every day it's Robert from you that's
[1:28:28] why Paul's giving Tim this exhortation
[1:28:30] holding that faith
[1:28:32] and in good conscience some he says
[1:28:36] have put away
[1:28:38] concerning that faith
[1:28:41] and where does it leave them when they
[1:28:43] put away this current concerning of the
[1:28:45] faith has made them a shipwreck what is
[1:28:49] a shipwreck a shipwreck means that you
[1:28:51] have gone astray
[1:28:53] you have left the word
[1:28:56] what was it first a robbing of the faith
[1:28:59] when their faith was robbed and they did
[1:29:02] not hold on to that concerning of the
[1:29:04] faith they ended up off the word
[1:29:08] that's a shipwreck
[1:29:10] gone astray you say oh they still come
[1:29:13] to church absolutely oh they still
[1:29:14] preach yeah oh they still Philip yeah
[1:29:17] absolutely
[1:29:19] but what if but where have they gone
[1:29:21] astray
[1:29:22] in the word yeah look what he says now
[1:29:25] now
[1:29:27] uh
[1:29:28] we don't would not typically do this uh
[1:29:32] but as you read through the New
[1:29:33] Testament you find out that Paul had
[1:29:35] absolutely no qualms in calling names
[1:29:39] and here he does it again he says of
[1:29:42] home
[1:29:43] he's calling out a couple that have
[1:29:46] Shipwrecked have gone off the word
[1:29:50] of whom is hymenius and Alexander he
[1:29:55] calls them by name
[1:29:57] whom I have delivered unto Satan
[1:30:01] that they may learn not to blaspheme
[1:30:06] wow that sounds rough Paul you really
[1:30:10] you you turn those over you turn those
[1:30:12] Brothers over to the devil
[1:30:15] absolutely
[1:30:17] amen a lot of people don't like that
[1:30:19] part of the scripture but it's the truth
[1:30:21] Amen brother Branham talked about it
[1:30:24] he talked about it even in the church in
[1:30:27] the Barham Tabernacle of turning them
[1:30:29] over to the devil through the
[1:30:31] destruction of their flesh so their soul
[1:30:33] might be saved
[1:30:34] what are they doing when they're
[1:30:36] blaspheming against God they've
[1:30:38] Shipwrecked themselves they've gone
[1:30:40] astray off the word
[1:30:42] they've left the pure word that was once
[1:30:45] delivered unto them and they've gone off
[1:30:47] onto a shipwreck not concerning
[1:30:50] themselves with the faith
[1:30:52] oh my so Paul turns them over to the
[1:30:56] devil
[1:30:57] and he had that authority to do that
[1:31:00] any Christian does
[1:31:02] amen he Christian mother father any
[1:31:04] Christian
[1:31:06] Pastor brother sister have that
[1:31:08] Authority
[1:31:10] you can do it a church can do that
[1:31:12] especially if that individual is under
[1:31:14] the protection of the blood of that
[1:31:16] church that church has that uh right to
[1:31:21] do
[1:31:21] amen if this person has gone off and
[1:31:24] obviously they were blasphemy now their
[1:31:27] blasphemy may not have been as much as
[1:31:30] uh what we've heard or seen today or uh
[1:31:34] coming back and saying things that
[1:31:36] people have said about the message and
[1:31:38] about brother Bradham and all that it
[1:31:40] may have been just as something as
[1:31:41] simple as just
[1:31:43] changing the word that was delivered to
[1:31:45] them yes amen Jesus said our uh Satan
[1:31:51] said uh surely you'll not die
[1:31:55] it's just a little change
[1:31:57] but that was a blasphemy
[1:31:59] why was it blasphemy because it was
[1:32:01] against God's word yes anything against
[1:32:04] God's word is blasphemy yes and these
[1:32:08] men were caught
[1:32:09] blaspheming God
[1:32:12] how oh it doesn't say but it could have
[1:32:15] been something just as simple as what
[1:32:17] they had been starting to preach on
[1:32:20] what they had started to deliver to the
[1:32:23] people by getting off the word made them
[1:32:26] Shipwrecked
[1:32:27] off the word left the faith left the
[1:32:31] truth not believing see when they left
[1:32:34] the word they left the faith because as
[1:32:36] I've said many times friend faith comes
[1:32:38] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[1:32:40] but not just any word not just anybody's
[1:32:42] word
[1:32:43] it's the word of God it's got to be the
[1:32:46] pure unadulterated word of God not
[1:32:49] somebody's idea not some hash in some
[1:32:51] imagination or some uh uh Seminary or
[1:32:54] something it has to be the pure and
[1:32:56] adulterated word of God that's why God
[1:32:58] took a man like brother Branham like he
[1:33:01] did
[1:33:01] in faith bringing him in to to preach
[1:33:05] the message he did and give him the
[1:33:06] gifts he had it putting him in that
[1:33:08] position
[1:33:10] brother random couldn't attain to any
[1:33:12] great uh education
[1:33:14] he couldn't attain to any great social
[1:33:17] status he was no great big man no tall
[1:33:21] man
[1:33:22] nothing that anybody would would look to
[1:33:25] him and think anything about him
[1:33:28] but God was with him amen and when God
[1:33:31] is with you that changes everything yes
[1:33:34] amen God used that man
[1:33:37] to bring that word to bring that word
[1:33:39] that that Bible made a Bible and you put
[1:33:42] nothing nothing off the word nothing
[1:33:44] outside the word but to bring that word
[1:33:47] to make it light
[1:33:49] for this last day for thee for the
[1:33:52] people of God in that Faith to learn and
[1:33:55] to grow
[1:33:56] now Satan's here to try to steal it from
[1:33:59] you
[1:34:00] amen he didn't he tried when the brother
[1:34:03] Branham was here
[1:34:04] but he didn't try as hard as and bring
[1:34:07] it in as heavy as he does nowadays
[1:34:10] you know you all these people against
[1:34:12] the things that brother Brown said and
[1:34:14] stories and things like that or it
[1:34:16] wasn't in the newspaper all these other
[1:34:18] things the cloud and stuff you didn't
[1:34:20] hear them saying all that stuff when
[1:34:22] when brother Branham was here
[1:34:24] amen because he lived it you didn't hear
[1:34:27] him so much doing all that even when the
[1:34:29] brothers that witness it were here at
[1:34:31] that time
[1:34:32] but now as you see different ones going
[1:34:34] away brother mccus of brother green
[1:34:36] specifically here in this city and
[1:34:38] different ones that have passed on those
[1:34:40] that were with brother random have gone
[1:34:42] by the way of the Grave for the most
[1:34:43] part and aren't here to witness against
[1:34:45] it now and now you hear in full force
[1:34:48] what's the devil doing
[1:34:50] he's bringing it in here trying to steal
[1:34:52] and Rob and Destroy and kill everything
[1:34:56] he can now to come against that work or
[1:34:59] were they 20 40 50 years ago
[1:35:03] amen he knows that's when to strike
[1:35:06] but that's what means that we must
[1:35:08] contend we must fight that much harder
[1:35:11] to hold on to that that we know is ours
[1:35:13] that we know that that belongs to us
[1:35:16] that belongs to our families that we
[1:35:19] know is a part of our inheritance our
[1:35:21] posterity belongs to us doesn't belong
[1:35:24] to the devil but Satan's trying to steal
[1:35:26] them
[1:35:27] he's trying to rob from you what belongs
[1:35:29] to you
[1:35:31] Faith holds on
[1:35:33] Faith beliefs Faith doesn't doubt Faith
[1:35:36] doesn't let go Faith doesn't give up
[1:35:39] Faith holds on
[1:35:41] faith is true amen second Corinthians
[1:35:46] let's turn over to Second Corinthians
[1:35:48] chapter 10.
[1:35:53] friend when you go off the word
[1:35:56] either come back or you go off the edge
[1:36:00] there's only two choices
[1:36:02] amen either come back or go off the edge
[1:36:06] that's why Paul was turning them over to
[1:36:08] the devil so so that they've learned not
[1:36:11] to blaspheme and come back in their way
[1:36:13] in the way of truth yes and the way of
[1:36:16] Faith as he put it in the way of faith
[1:36:18] and he was given Timothy that lesson and
[1:36:22] telling Timothy fight that good Warfare
[1:36:25] hold on to that phase hold on to that
[1:36:28] these that God has spoke to you through
[1:36:31] these through these utterances through
[1:36:33] these prophecies
[1:36:34] hold on to that fulfill that purpose
[1:36:38] live that purpose but fight that good
[1:36:40] fight hold on to that Warfare
[1:36:43] and hold on to faith don't let it slip
[1:36:47] amen don't let it slip second
[1:36:50] Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:36:53] we'll begin reading with verse one
[1:36:56] now Paul now I Paul myself
[1:36:59] beseech you by the meekness and
[1:37:01] gentleness of Christ who in present and
[1:37:05] base among you
[1:37:07] but being absent and bold towards you
[1:37:11] but I beseech you that I may uh that I
[1:37:15] may not be bold when I am present with
[1:37:17] the uh with the confidence with that
[1:37:20] confidence
[1:37:21] where would I think to be bold against
[1:37:23] some which think of us as if we walked
[1:37:27] according to the flesh
[1:37:29] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:37:32] not war after the flesh
[1:37:36] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:37:39] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:37:42] pulling down of strongholds
[1:37:45] Satan's strongholds
[1:37:48] Faith does what it tears those
[1:37:50] strongholds down amen whoever they are
[1:37:53] wherever they are
[1:37:55] amen somebody may look to be the
[1:37:59] strongest crustiest hardest so you'll
[1:38:01] never win them to Christ that's exactly
[1:38:03] what they thought here and and he's
[1:38:06] saying that we we take the Weaponry of
[1:38:09] God that is mighty to pull that
[1:38:11] stronghold down
[1:38:12] bring that person to their knees bring
[1:38:15] them where they're supposed to be in
[1:38:17] Christ
[1:38:18] amen if they belong to you then you have
[1:38:20] that right
[1:38:21] amen that is your inheritance that is
[1:38:23] your right
[1:38:24] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:38:28] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:38:31] knowledge of God what is it what is the
[1:38:33] knowledge of God the knowledge of God is
[1:38:35] really and speaking here is not
[1:38:36] intellectualism it's revelation
[1:38:39] of the true revealed word and the
[1:38:42] knowledge of God is what Paul is
[1:38:44] speaking of that the Lord used him to
[1:38:46] bring fruit and other brothers but the
[1:38:49] truth of God the messenger of that age
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:54] against it exalted itself against the
[1:38:57] word the knowledge of God and bringing
[1:39:00] into captivity every thought to The
[1:39:04] Obedience of Christ Christ is the word
[1:39:07] so what does he do it takes all of your
[1:39:10] thoughts anything that comes in your
[1:39:13] mind as a thought of yours a reasoning
[1:39:16] of yours how many times we try to reason
[1:39:18] things away oh I do this because on you
[1:39:21] reason or what all the word says but I
[1:39:24] thought you knew reasonable
[1:39:26] but the Bible says Paul says to bring
[1:39:28] every one of those thoughts captive to
[1:39:31] The Obedience of the word
[1:39:34] amen of Christ the word amen obedience
[1:39:38] to this word
[1:39:40] remember obedience is better than
[1:39:42] sacrifice amen we're to bring all of it
[1:39:45] together well I can't do this bring it
[1:39:47] to The Obedience of the word the word
[1:39:49] says you can oh I I don't do you bring
[1:39:52] it to The Obedience of the word every
[1:39:54] thought
[1:39:55] every thought that you have every
[1:39:57] reasoning that you have you take that
[1:40:00] see because remember now Satan will give
[1:40:02] you a thought
[1:40:04] and he'll drop a thought in your mind
[1:40:06] and he'll have you thinking that's your
[1:40:08] fault the whole time he dropped it in
[1:40:10] there he'll have you repenting for a
[1:40:12] thought that you thought you had that he
[1:40:14] put on you right and you're repenting
[1:40:17] for something you didn't even do
[1:40:20] that's the truth that's Satan's thought
[1:40:22] yeah that's why it says you take that
[1:40:24] thought you bring it captive to the word
[1:40:26] yes the word Christ and you bring a
[1:40:30] captive to that word it's like uh it's
[1:40:34] like a virus in a computer
[1:40:36] they have a antivirus and I probably
[1:40:39] shouldn't go here because I'm pretty
[1:40:40] ignorant in this situation but I know
[1:40:42] that what an antivirus does if a virus
[1:40:45] comes it's supposed to grab that virus
[1:40:46] and identify it and say okay that's not
[1:40:49] that's a foreign object that's not
[1:40:50] supposed to be in here
[1:40:52] amen think of it now that's your mind
[1:40:55] that's your mind now let this mind be in
[1:40:57] you which is in Christ Jesus and we're
[1:40:59] not talking carnal remember we're
[1:41:00] talking our spiritual warfare and you
[1:41:03] bring that into obedience to the word
[1:41:07] because that for an object is trying to
[1:41:10] come in your head to try to take you
[1:41:12] away from the word or bring it contrary
[1:41:15] to the word you take that thought and
[1:41:17] that antiverse says that doesn't belong
[1:41:19] here
[1:41:20] and it takes that thought and it throws
[1:41:21] it into a uh a vault and it seals The
[1:41:25] Vault so it doesn't corrupt the rest of
[1:41:27] your computer
[1:41:28] amen
[1:41:30] pretty cold quarantine yeah quarantine I
[1:41:34] mean quarantine means nobody can come in
[1:41:35] and they can't get out
[1:41:37] that's what a quarantined
[1:41:39] every thought captive quarantine take it
[1:41:43] in can't get out and it can't corrupt
[1:41:45] the rest of the computer you take every
[1:41:47] thought
[1:41:49] that comes against God's word you read
[1:41:51] in that word and there's and then trust
[1:41:54] me friends there are high menuses and
[1:41:56] and uh the other one they're they're out
[1:42:00] there today and they're out there
[1:42:01] preaching and they're out there to try
[1:42:03] to convince you that the things that you
[1:42:05] know God has delivered to you are not
[1:42:06] true but you look at God's word and it
[1:42:09] says in God's word that is true you take
[1:42:12] that thought captive and you put it in
[1:42:14] quarantine amen because it doesn't
[1:42:16] belong in you your thoughts should be
[1:42:18] obedience to this word yes every word
[1:42:23] I don't know about
[1:42:25] every word amen amen
[1:42:29] our thoughts
[1:42:31] are supposed to come in obedience to
[1:42:33] this word
[1:42:34] even if Satan puts that thought there
[1:42:38] something that Satan is trying to push
[1:42:40] on you try to get you to believe her or
[1:42:43] or entertain
[1:42:45] and it's just all along it was his
[1:42:48] thought that came in there cast down
[1:42:50] those imaginations cast down those
[1:42:52] reasonings bring every one of them to
[1:42:54] obedience to the word if there's a
[1:42:56] foreign matter that comes that's not
[1:42:57] supposed to be there because your mind
[1:42:59] is like the mind of Christ
[1:43:01] you take that word and that word is your
[1:43:04] antivirus and it takes that thought and
[1:43:06] puts it in quarantine or sends it back
[1:43:08] on the head of the devil where it lays
[1:43:10] till the day of judgment and Devil comes
[1:43:13] up and accuses you of that thought and
[1:43:15] God looks and says that was your thought
[1:43:17] devil
[1:43:18] not my son not my daughter that was your
[1:43:21] thought
[1:43:22] and you're going to be held accountable
[1:43:23] to that thought in the Lake of Fire
[1:43:26] praise God
[1:43:27] god holds his children Guiltless
[1:43:30] praise the lord we belong to him because
[1:43:33] you're bringing in obedience to the word
[1:43:35] and obedience to Christ the word
[1:43:39] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:43:41] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:43:45] which is the word and having in a uh and
[1:43:49] having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[1:43:52] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:43:55] fulfilled
[1:43:56] praise the Lord
[1:43:57] every thought Saints let's go to one
[1:44:00] more second Timothy chapter four
[1:44:04] second Timothy chapter four you'll find
[1:44:06] obedience in God's word will make your
[1:44:08] life a lot easier
[1:44:11] amen amen
[1:44:13] you'll find obedience to God's word will
[1:44:15] make your life a lot better yes it'll
[1:44:18] make your life less of a struggle
[1:44:20] it'll make your life a lot easier if we
[1:44:23] just follow an obedience to God's word
[1:44:25] it won't be without fights
[1:44:28] it won't be without balance it won't be
[1:44:30] without the devil coming and trying to
[1:44:31] steal it from you but your life will be
[1:44:34] better
[1:44:35] amen
[1:44:37] speaking from somebody with experience
[1:44:40] who has gone outside of The Obedience of
[1:44:42] God
[1:44:44] it's hard
[1:44:46] I I don't think I can imagine
[1:44:50] as a child that any child has ever
[1:44:53] enjoyed a woman
[1:44:57] or a timeout or whatever they are today
[1:45:00] I can't imagine any one of them
[1:45:04] but I bet they can tell you that they
[1:45:05] learned something from it
[1:45:08] I got discipline for this because this
[1:45:10] was displeasing to my parents
[1:45:13] I got discipline for this as a child of
[1:45:15] God because it was Disobedience to God
[1:45:19] amen and God discipline us so that we're
[1:45:22] not chastened with the world
[1:45:24] so that we're not judged with the world
[1:45:27] so that we're not condemned with the
[1:45:29] world God chastens us so that we realize
[1:45:33] Lord it brings us to a repentance Lord
[1:45:36] I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that I
[1:45:38] didn't mean to act that whatever it
[1:45:39] might have been
[1:45:41] brings it into obedience Lord I'm sorry
[1:45:44] and you can trust me if there's less of
[1:45:47] those your life is a lot easier
[1:45:50] it's harder as a child I know when a
[1:45:53] child has feeling his way and trying to
[1:45:58] so is oats or his as a as a little kid
[1:46:02] and and try to be rebellious and trying
[1:46:05] to fight and and and trying to find his
[1:46:08] way you know it takes a good Godly
[1:46:11] parent right there to put that child
[1:46:13] right back where he's supposed to be
[1:46:15] now you got today you got what they call
[1:46:17] free-range parenting oh just let the
[1:46:20] child do whatever he wants it'll be okay
[1:46:23] just you know
[1:46:25] if you want if you want to go bounce a
[1:46:27] basketball in the middle of the Oracle
[1:46:29] go right ahead it's okay you'll be all
[1:46:31] right
[1:46:32] just free-range parenting let the child
[1:46:35] that's what they call it just let the
[1:46:36] child do whatever they want if they want
[1:46:38] to be a boy one day and a girl the next
[1:46:40] day if they don't want to be either one
[1:46:42] day or whatever it's okay you know
[1:46:45] you'll be all right you know love will
[1:46:47] eventually conquer no a parent has to be
[1:46:50] there to train that child yeah to Reign
[1:46:53] that child in and that's because that's
[1:46:55] the example God gives us
[1:46:57] if God just said okay you just go do
[1:47:00] like a lot of Christians believe that
[1:47:02] God he just winks and ignorance you just
[1:47:04] go do whatever you want it's okay it'll
[1:47:06] all come and Rewind itself around back
[1:47:08] in the no no if you're a child of God
[1:47:11] and you get off the off the path God
[1:47:13] will discipline you so that you're not
[1:47:15] condemned with the world yes to bring
[1:47:18] you back to the place you're supposed to
[1:47:19] be to be that Godly person that God's
[1:47:22] called for us
[1:47:24] bring in obedience everything in
[1:47:27] obedience second Timothy chapter four
[1:47:31] read this scripture and I will close
[1:47:33] here
[1:47:37] II Timothy chapter 4 verse 1.
[1:47:41] I charge thee therefore before God and
[1:47:43] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:46] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[1:47:48] the alive and the dead at his appearing
[1:47:50] and his kingdom
[1:47:52] preach the word
[1:47:54] be instant in season out of season
[1:47:58] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:48:00] long-suffering and Doctrine for the time
[1:48:03] will come when they will not endure
[1:48:06] sound Doctrine
[1:48:08] the truth Revelation the word
[1:48:11] they will not endure it they want it but
[1:48:15] after them after their own lust
[1:48:17] shall they heed to themselves teachers
[1:48:20] having itching years
[1:48:21] and remember a hireling doesn't care
[1:48:24] about the Sheep
[1:48:26] that's what Jesus said
[1:48:28] only the shepherd cares about the sheep
[1:48:31] and Harley doesn't care about the Sheep
[1:48:32] if a man is just up there for a meal
[1:48:35] ticket if he's just up there to be
[1:48:37] popular powerful against some wealth of
[1:48:39] some kind then he doesn't care about the
[1:48:42] Sheep harling doesn't care about the
[1:48:44] Sheep only the shepherd cares about the
[1:48:46] Sheep right amen
[1:48:48] so it hireling is someone that it
[1:48:51] teaches having itchy ears that'll just
[1:48:53] come in and just uh say whatever the
[1:48:56] congregation wants to hear
[1:48:58] you know I I believe it this way but you
[1:49:00] know my congregation the way they are I
[1:49:03] won't say that
[1:49:04] I I won't preach it like that I won't I
[1:49:07] won't preach it this way I won't bring
[1:49:08] that message or that subject because it
[1:49:11] would upset my congregation teachers
[1:49:13] having itching years not bringing the
[1:49:16] pure word of God and what they know they
[1:49:18] should do amen it's a perversion saint
[1:49:24] s amen
[1:49:25] preach your convictions Praise Your
[1:49:28] Truth stand on that word
[1:49:31] that's the truth or help or or or bring
[1:49:34] together somebody I I I may have told
[1:49:37] you this story
[1:49:39] but I remember years ago when I uh when
[1:49:41] I worked in um uh in Charlotte and I was
[1:49:45] hired in as a assistive buyer assistant
[1:49:48] uh purchasing agent
[1:49:51] and we had sales Consultants calling us
[1:49:53] all the time and there was one sales
[1:49:54] consultant he was pretty uh he was
[1:49:57] pretty I would say staunching his
[1:49:59] religious belief he didn't hide it under
[1:50:01] a bushel he didn't uh he didn't pull any
[1:50:04] punches he let everybody know he's a
[1:50:06] Christian he went to church and and that
[1:50:08] kind of thing and he was talking with
[1:50:11] the buyer at the time his name was Roy
[1:50:14] and he was trying to get Roy to go to
[1:50:16] church he really is just just trying to
[1:50:18] go to church I don't talk to people and
[1:50:20] say you need to go to church
[1:50:22] I try when I try to witness some people
[1:50:24] I tell people you need to get to Christ
[1:50:26] yes amen I'm not worried about getting
[1:50:29] somebody into four walls into some kind
[1:50:31] of an assembly I'm worried about getting
[1:50:33] people to Jesus Christ yes if you get
[1:50:36] them to Christ Christ will lead them
[1:50:38] where they're supposed to be
[1:50:39] he was trying to roll you just need to
[1:50:41] go to
[1:50:42] church he said he said just pick one you
[1:50:45] like he said a church is like a glove
[1:50:48] you know if it fits if the preachers
[1:50:51] just say whatever you want him to say
[1:50:52] he's saying whatever you want to hear
[1:50:54] you just go to that church
[1:50:57] I want a soul why the devil I'm sitting
[1:51:00] in the room across the hall in my office
[1:51:02] I think what a subtle lie the devil to
[1:51:04] tell a man like that something like that
[1:51:06] being a professed Christian I'm not
[1:51:10] putting the man down uh they're probably
[1:51:12] both passed by now anyway they were
[1:51:13] older men but
[1:51:15] I I thought what a lie the devil that is
[1:51:19] absolutely you don't go to church to try
[1:51:22] to fit like a glove right you go to
[1:51:25] church to let the word of God be
[1:51:27] preached to you and God sometimes take
[1:51:29] the hot off her backs sometimes hear the
[1:51:32] pure word of God sometime in correction
[1:51:35] to bring us back because we've gotten
[1:51:36] off the path Lord help me I need to get
[1:51:40] back right with you that's fighting for
[1:51:41] the good fight amen that's fighting for
[1:51:44] the faith that was once delivered where
[1:51:47] is it gone oh God where has that gone
[1:51:51] people have lost their fight yes people
[1:51:54] have given up people say well we'll just
[1:51:57] go it's like I said before you know
[1:52:01] coming into a little place like this a
[1:52:03] lot of people will be embarrassed to be
[1:52:04] in a place like this
[1:52:05] there's so few people
[1:52:07] it's a job we just done the past couple
[1:52:10] of times up in Colorado Springs
[1:52:12] that the the little area is called New
[1:52:15] Life even the commons there is called
[1:52:17] New Life Commons and you look over and
[1:52:19] there's this big humongous building with
[1:52:22] a cross at the top of the church
[1:52:24] and I had that guy I told you before
[1:52:26] that uh that that I still call them
[1:52:29] curmudgeon he's not anymore but you
[1:52:31] remember the guy told us he's kind of
[1:52:33] come one of my friends now
[1:52:35] um
[1:52:36] um and it's amazing the influence but
[1:52:39] anyway and he he looked he said oh
[1:52:41] there's tons of money in that he said
[1:52:43] that looks like your Church Newton I
[1:52:45] said my church wouldn't even fit in that
[1:52:47] Church's bathroom
[1:52:49] he started laughing
[1:52:51] amen I said that we'd probably have to
[1:52:54] we'd probably have to double in size to
[1:52:57] fit in that Church's bathroom
[1:52:58] amen but that's what it is to those
[1:53:01] people it's time saints that we fight
[1:53:05] that we fight harder than ever amen
[1:53:08] because that's exactly the slippery
[1:53:09] slope that Satan is trying to take us
[1:53:11] down to yes oh Paul is telling Timothy
[1:53:15] preach the word
[1:53:17] be in C's not a seasoned friend if God

[1:54:43] work of the Evangelist make full proof
[1:54:45] of thy Ministry for I am now ready to be
[1:54:48] offered and the time of my departure is
[1:54:50] at hand I have fault what
[1:54:53] I have thought the good fight
[1:54:57] did he come across people that he had to
[1:54:59] fight the good fight with
[1:55:00] absolutely amen if it was of the devil
[1:55:05] anything that's off the word is of the
[1:55:07] devil I have fought thee good fight I
[1:55:12] have kept I have finished my course I
[1:55:15] have kept the faith
[1:55:18] praise the Lord
[1:55:20] I want that to be my testimony when it
[1:55:22] comes to time that I'm about to draw my
[1:55:24] last breath yes amen if this man don't
[1:55:27] make it by a Rapture the body change
[1:55:28] friend when my last breath comes I want
[1:55:30] that to be my testimony yes to be able
[1:55:33] to stand and say I fought the good fight
[1:55:36] I have finished my course and I have
[1:55:39] kept the faith
[1:55:40] praise the Lord
[1:55:42] don't let anything steal it from these
[1:55:44] things yeah fight that good fight yes
[1:55:47] continue to press forward and everything
[1:55:50] that Satan's doing in this world to try
[1:55:52] to Rob our faith promise
[1:55:54] everything that we have we've got it
[1:55:56] we've got it so good
[1:55:57] we do and I'm not complaining about that
[1:56:00] God's blessed us so but we've got it so
[1:56:03] good
[1:56:04] so many times we look and say words are
[1:56:07] Faith
[1:56:09] do we need Faith now in in so many of
[1:56:13] the things that we need you know you go
[1:56:15] over Caesar I've heard I'm not a
[1:56:17] missionary but hard to go overseas and
[1:56:19] people just don't have anything
[1:56:23] they don't have any food no money
[1:56:27] no means
[1:56:29] and and they simply live on faith
[1:56:33] if they get sick they don't have a
[1:56:35] doctor
[1:56:36] they don't have a medicine you haven't
[1:56:38] they don't have even if they had a
[1:56:40] doctor
[1:56:41] probably not even close to the type of
[1:56:44] education and knowledge that we have in
[1:56:46] this country of a doctor in hospitals in
[1:56:48] the cleanliness and all they don't have
[1:56:51] that
[1:56:52] they just gotta purely simply believe
[1:56:55] that faith how Satan is trying so hard
[1:56:59] to Rob us of that friends but we can't
[1:57:01] let it happen
[1:57:03] amen we can't let it happen and I'm so
[1:57:05] thankful I'm so thankful of so many of
[1:57:09] the testimonies that I hear amen of how
[1:57:13] things come up
[1:57:15] and you just call out to the Lord there
[1:57:17] he is again something as simple as keys
[1:57:20] or a printer or a car or all the things
[1:57:27] forgive me if they failed good tests all
[1:57:29] the things if it's just something just
[1:57:32] that simple
[1:57:33] you know that Rings true in your soul
[1:57:36] it says I believe that God was going to
[1:57:39] let that happen that God was going to
[1:57:40] lead me to that that God was going to
[1:57:42] show me this or help me with this and
[1:57:44] bring me to that place if it just just
[1:57:47] the Simplicity of those things
[1:57:49] amen
[1:57:51] that's the faith that's that faith that
[1:57:54] we fight for when brother Dennis was
[1:57:56] going through his cancer thing and all
[1:57:57] that
[1:57:58] all over the place and all over his
[1:58:01] house and everywhere he went I don't
[1:58:03] know how many pennies he collected but
[1:58:05] they were everywhere
[1:58:07] just just the Simplicity of God showing
[1:58:11] him
[1:58:12] I'm with you
[1:58:14] faith believing
[1:58:16] I'm gonna take care of you
[1:58:18] and he did
[1:58:22] Simplicity but it's God
[1:58:24] but we fight the good fight
[1:58:26] The Honorable fight
[1:58:28] we don't do it with anger we don't do it
[1:58:31] with malice that we see so many times
[1:58:33] I've seen people even debate and I know
[1:58:36] the Bible says come reason
[1:58:38] and we and and people of different
[1:58:41] thoughts even in the message
[1:58:44] seeing it this way or seeing it that way
[1:58:46] and they come together and there just
[1:58:48] seems to be such a such a an angry
[1:58:52] contention
[1:58:54] a contention of malice and and even
[1:58:57] hatred to the point that how could you
[1:58:59] not believe this you're going to hell if
[1:59:01] you don't see it the way I do
[1:59:03] just attitude like that is that is not
[1:59:06] of God
[1:59:08] and I've seen that so many times
[1:59:11] I saw two brothers come out of brother
[1:59:14] Brandon used to tell the story uh
[1:59:16] brother green would reiterate the story
[1:59:18] the two brothers getting and throwing
[1:59:20] rocks at each other
[1:59:21] uh you know it was a comical thing but I
[1:59:25] don't believe that that's that we should
[1:59:27] come to that place to where we hate each
[1:59:29] other so much we're throwing rocks
[1:59:33] verbal or physical
[1:59:36] amen but we do fight the good honorable
[1:59:41] honest honorable fight
[1:59:44] praise the Lord how did how did he fight
[1:59:47] how does he fight for you
[1:59:49] what did God do to fight to bring you
[1:59:52] back to where you need to be he gave his
[1:59:55] only begotten son yes
[1:59:58] could he have banished the Devil
[1:59:59] complete that of existence within the
[2:00:01] twinkling of an eye absolutely did he do
[2:00:04] it no
[2:00:05] no he has to go through this all this
[2:00:07] whole process just like every one of us
[2:00:09] and go to the very end where he's guilty
[2:00:11] of every sin that he ever felt like he
[2:00:13] caused you to commit he'll be guilty of
[2:00:16] it and cast in the Lake of Fire
[2:00:18] that'll be his demise yeah
[2:00:20] because God is a just God
[2:00:23] is a righteous God Amen God is God is a
[2:00:27] god of uh of of patience and
[2:00:30] long-suffering amen but he's a God that
[2:00:33] doesn't change he's a god of his word
[2:00:36] amen and he's a just God
[2:00:39] praise the Lord let's stand our feet if
[2:00:41] we could
[2:00:52] fight the good fight scenes
[2:00:56] stand on that word hold true to that
[2:00:59] conviction that God gave you
[2:01:01] that God has built to this on that
[2:01:03] Foundation
[2:01:05] our foundation that we talk so much of
[2:01:08] would we always major so much on the
[2:01:12] Capstone and the brotherly kindness and
[2:01:14] all and all the things at the top which
[2:01:16] I agree we're we're there
[2:01:19] I don't disagree with that friend but
[2:01:21] you can't ever it's like people major so
[2:01:24] much on getting the Holy Ghost and
[2:01:25] that's true and we should that's
[2:01:27] absolutely Paramount for us you won't
[2:01:29] make it in the Rapture without it but
[2:01:31] you can't take that and forget about
[2:01:33] justification
[2:01:35] you can't just let justification go you
[2:01:38] can't even get to the Holy Ghost without
[2:01:39] justification
[2:01:41] it's a step that brings you to that
[2:01:43] place and you can't forget the faith you
[2:01:46] can't let the faith go that's the
[2:01:48] foundation of the whole building
[2:01:51] yes we're getting that at that Capstone
[2:01:53] the bride love
[2:01:55] but without the foundation there's no
[2:01:58] way you're going to get there
[2:01:59] amen can't happen
[2:02:02] praise the Lord but God makes a way
[2:02:04] God always makes a way
[2:02:07] don't let the left don't let the devil
[2:02:09] steal it from you amen
[2:02:11] I want to sing this song we didn't sing
[2:02:13] it
[2:02:15] during service Micah mentioned it
[2:02:18] amen
[2:02:20] uh it's it's in the songbook I don't
[2:02:22] remember let's see it's 263 in the
[2:02:24] songbook but we'll have it here on my
[2:02:26] screen if you want to read it there
[2:02:29] amen
[2:02:31] let's start with the chorus it's been a
[2:02:34] while since we sang it amen different
[2:02:37] now praise the Lord amen
[2:02:41] yes different now since Jesus saved my
[2:02:45] soul is different now since far he is
[2:02:50] what I'm hold oh Satan had to flee when
[2:02:56] Jesus rescued me now is different
[2:03:01] oh so different now
[2:03:06] once I was lost in sin I had no peace
[2:03:10] within to save my weary soul I knew not
[2:03:15] help but Jesus came to me and by his
[2:03:20] grace I'm free now is different
[2:03:25] oh so different now is different now
[2:03:31] since Jesus saved my soul it's different
[2:03:35] now since by his blood I am born oh
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:53] I went to church one day do you hear
[2:03:57] them sing and pray the preacher firmly
[2:04:01] follow that gospel wow
[2:04:04] he said you must read
[2:04:10] and now
[2:04:14] so different now now it is
[2:04:21] [Music]
[2:04:34] now with different
[2:04:37] clothes
[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:52] but just one lens of him it broke the
[2:04:56] power of man now this difference
[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:10] it's different now since by his time
[2:05:16] when
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:32] I Praise Him day and night how do you
[2:05:36] so I know
[2:05:40] but a praise the Lord is done the
[2:05:43] victory now is gone now is
[2:05:53] different now since Jesus in my soul
[2:05:58] is different
[2:06:00] goodbye
[2:06:09] is
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:16] different now since Jesus Christ
[2:06:27] old days
[2:06:29] [Music]
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:42] amen hallelujah
[2:06:44] always different now Saints isn't it
[2:06:47] yeah praise the Lord Jesus one Satan had
[2:06:50] his grip but Jesus came and loosed and
[2:06:54] set me free made everything different
[2:06:57] the life I used to love I now hate the
[2:07:00] life I used to hate I now love because
[2:07:03] he made it different
[2:07:04] praise the Lord Jesus in me he is
[2:07:09] and different by his grace amen praise
[2:07:12] the Lord Jesus thank God for that amen
[2:07:15] God bless you today I pray something was
[2:07:17] said to bless and strength in the Lord
[2:07:19] today amen I want to mention a couple
[2:07:21] things
[2:07:22] I mentioned last week that brother Roger
[2:07:25] had invited us to a communion service
[2:07:27] they're having tonight if you'd like to
[2:07:30] go their service starts at five o'clock
[2:07:31] if you need the address I'll get you the
[2:07:34] address or text it to your whatever so
[2:07:36] if you uh desire to go the Lord willing
[2:07:39] I do plan to go
[2:07:41] so I plan to be there if you want to go
[2:07:45] just let me know like I said it starts
[2:07:47] at five o'clock and I get you the
[2:07:49] address if you'd like it also
[2:07:52] uh next week I am going to Pennsylvania
[2:07:57] uh flying out on Mother's Day to
[2:08:01] Pennsylvania and the only flight uh that
[2:08:04] I could get leaves at 1 30. so I'm going
[2:08:07] to try to probably start a little early
[2:08:10] uh the service so that uh can be done a
[2:08:13] little sooner than normal and uh and
[2:08:17] because I got to be at the airport by 12
[2:08:18] 30 which if this service was today is 15
[2:08:22] minutes from right now so
[2:08:25] um so I told him I said it's okay I'll
[2:08:28] work it out we can
[2:08:30] um
[2:08:30] I'll start a little early and maybe have
[2:08:33] one less song or something now if you
[2:08:35] have a testimony or you have a song or
[2:08:37] something I'm not wanna I don't want to
[2:08:39] disclose the Holy Ghost if the Lord's
[2:08:41] giving you something on your heart and
[2:08:42] to do uh by all means amen we'll do it
[2:08:46] the Lord if he can hold a plane for a
[2:08:49] profit in Memphis he can hold a plane
[2:08:50] for me so uh I'm I'm not gonna let it
[2:08:55] affect in that way so if it's something
[2:08:57] on your heart then by all means don't
[2:08:59] say well we've got to be in a hurry
[2:09:01] Sunday and I don't want to be that way
[2:09:03] uh but I probably will start a little
[2:09:06] early and maybe I won't have as many
[2:09:08] songs uh and just see what the message
[2:09:12] is the Lord gives us for Mother's Day so
[2:09:16] so please thank you remember that keep
[2:09:19] that on your heart
[2:09:21] um for next Sunday so Lord willing it's
[2:09:24] uh it there was a couple of flights that
[2:09:27] left later at night but and it left at
[2:09:30] seven here at night and didn't get there
[2:09:33] until seven in the morning
[2:09:35] so that didn't really quite work we're
[2:09:38] actually on the job before seven o'clock
[2:09:40] so anyway uh just to let you know that
[2:09:43] we will probably be starting a little
[2:09:45] bit early next Sunday
[2:09:50] I was going to do like 10 20.
[2:09:54] something like that not I wasn't I know
[2:09:57] you know there's been a little
[2:09:58] resistance about 10 o'clock which is
[2:10:00] fine I like 10 30 myself
[2:10:05] yeah but if everybody thinks they can do
[2:10:07] 10 o'clock that's fine too
[2:10:10] um
[2:10:11] you know we very seldom ever have any
[2:10:15] visitors that
[2:10:16] uh come knowing it's 10 30 so
[2:10:20] I don't know that that would be a huge
[2:10:21] hindrance but we could do 10 if you do
[2:10:23] anybody have an objection since Norman
[2:10:26] says okay
[2:10:27] uh if you if you do though let me know
[2:10:29] because
[2:10:31] well then we'll just make it 10 o'clock
[2:10:33] next Sunday okay that'll work that
[2:10:35] that'll be fine then appreciate that
[2:10:38] thank you
[2:10:39] um so thank you Lord bless you
[2:10:42] appreciate you in that and thank you for
[2:10:45] your prayers this past week uh what why

[2:11:02] little bit more rest I didn't leave
[2:11:03] yesterday morning till 11 30 from Denver
[2:11:05] so I got to sleep a little bit later uh
[2:11:09] so that helped me get a little bit more
[2:11:11] rest so Lord willing I know I told you
