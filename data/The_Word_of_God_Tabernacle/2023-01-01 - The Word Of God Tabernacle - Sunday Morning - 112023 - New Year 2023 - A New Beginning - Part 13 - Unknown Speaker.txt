more we have left amen but we know that they're in his hands for us and all things work together for our good praise the lord it's an interesting thing I looked at it a little bit I don't put a whole lot of um effort and energy into this but uh sister Judy Arnold sent something to Sonya last night and uh the first church age uh lasted 117 years and 2023 is the 117th year of laodicea now we know we know brother Branham said laodicea goes into Perdition so this can't be the last year of laodicea you got three and a half after the bride leaves there's three and a half years of tribulation laodicea and end of Perdition so uh but I just found it interesting that this year is the year that we actually match the duration of the first church year so that was interesting so sister Judy if you're watching I did find that interesting again I what it means I have no idea uh but again those little details like the pope passing away um the Pope Benedict not the current one but the one that retired all those things I I'm not a prophet I can't tell you necessarily this the Lord shows me the significance of it but I know that they're in the religious realm there's a significance to this that's happening in another Spirit there that's broke so amen Lord knows amen but I'm happy to be his I'm happy to be here happy to be in the house of the Lord today so amen open our service in prayer and Joel would you open our service in prayer bag thank you Lord for giving us more blessings thank you Lord I just hope that you give us another good year yes amen amen praise the Lord you could be seated if you'd like amen we're going to go and turn over to uh it's on number 629 we'll have it on the screen here anyway Mercy rewrote my life praise the Lord balance has shifted [Music] him praise the Lord not his sister Julie Zone and I lived here on her own now of course there's probably going to be others come if you were out not feeling well today but man we're here to worship and praise the Lord so 629 Mercy rewrote my life [Music] we wrote my mind [Music] yes Mercy we wrote my love well I should have fallen my soul cast now but God's mercy Mercy rewrote my love it was God's mercy read my life oh yes Hallelujah God's mercy [Music] well I should have all heard my soul cast out but God's mercies [Music] [Music] yes Mercy we wrote my life well I should have fallen my soul cast now but God's mercy he wrote my love amen thank you Jesus for that Mercy oh friend where would we be without it today amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord you know we're entering into this new year and we need his Mercy more and more than ever amen to overshadow our lives praise the Lord 405 amen warned again praise the Lord thankful to be born again amen praise the Lord A New Beginning that's what we talk about that's what our Series has been about that's what we're facing today New Beginning amen praise the Lord a lot of people make resolutions on the first day of the year New Year's resolutions and of course probably 99 of them are more uh get broken probably in the first two weeks uh I don't make resolutions but I try to consecrate myself more to the Lord amen every day praise the Lord so as we enter this new beginning thank God to be born again listening to him now born born again thank God I'm born again [Music] thank God [Music] thank God again thank God I'm born again [Music] yes yes [Music] [Music] that [Music] is things [Music] thought out one more time now born again [Music] [Music] thought I was born again praise the Lord Jesus amen you know Nicodemus it baffled him when Jesus told him that he just couldn't grasp it he just couldn't understand how can I enter into my mother's womb the second time something that's miracle that God placed in each believer to be able to be born again to be renewed to be regenerated for his Spirit to move into us and take control over our lives and make us new creatures in Christ Jesus amen you don't maybe think a whole lot about it in that context but friend it's a miracle that a person born in sins shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies can be changed into a new creation amen by the grace of God Amen thank you Lord born again one more uh different one amen we'll see thank God still to be born again amen born again it's 4.92 in the book born again there's really religion [Music] born again and it's all because of Calvary well I'm glad so glad amen [Music] yes born again there's [Music] just like Jesus said and born again and it's all because of Calvary oh I'm glad so glad that I've been born again you glad he is born again yes Hallelujah born again just like Jesus said born again and it's all because of Calvary well I'm glad so glad that I've been born again over time yes born again there's really been a change in me Hallelujah morning and just like Jesus said well born again and it's all because of calvary well I'm glad so glad that I've been born again amen so glad Saints Hallelujah so glad I've been born again thank you Lord Jesus amen that born that new birth will make a real change in you too amen praise the Lord Jesus it'll make as Paul said it'll make the things that you love you now hate the things you hated you love praise the Lord and he knew he knew from experience he's the one who went down to try to put all of them that were worshiping God out of business amen one week he was going out to take him out of the business the next week he was down there preaching to him praise the Lord I say a week I don't know what the Bible doesn't give a time frame but one moment he's persecuting when the next minute he's preaching to him could you imagine I could just imagine people walking by a church and coming in and saying who's speaking tonight Paul Paul you kidding me you mean Saul the guy that tormented us and put us out of his same guy who's been a change in him and then he's a new person he's not the same guy it was just sit down and listen the wall amen there's been a change thank you Lord and we have a few prayer requests to bring to you this morning amen I know there's none over there Joel so don't worry about it usually I have him get them because sometimes people come in a little late and write them down so it gives everybody the opportunity to get them written down so uh that helps I think with the flow of the service but we didn't have any over there so um sister Sharia texted me this morning uh they are not feeling well they said they've been doing fine for the past couple of weeks and they woke up this morning and uh coughing and congestion and also please pray for them if you will also sister Shelia texted me and said that she's having I think she's Texas sisters too but she's having a lot of neck and shoulder pain for the past three days and she'd get got up was getting ready and want the comment it's just a pain just overtook her so please remember her in prayer Sharia and Sheila said they would be watching here so God bless you if you are and I'm going to be praying that the Lord just touched you all today also sister Matisse sent me a text and said that she's had a sort of a pretty bad sore throat and a deep cough she is feeling much better but again out of abundance of caution and trying to keep and make sure that those things stay isolated she decided to stay home today as well so please remember her in prayer uh also found out this week while I was out of town that a couple of dear friends of mine passed away a couple of Hall sisters brother Dwight Hall who some of you may know just from his singing prowess and brother Dwight Hall wrote a lot of songs sang a lot of songs made a lot of tapes CDs whatever they are right now so you may know brother Dwight from uh his singing I don't know if he ever came to Tabernacle not years ago I know we had since I've been here but maybe years ago he came brother Dwight his wife passed away this week so please remember human prayer was unexpected as far as I knew so please remember him in prayer they were getting up in age of course but precious brother precious sister a good family I was very dear friends with one of their sons for a while Paul Hall so let's please pray for them if you would also Gary Hall in Beaufort South Carolina his wife Jan passed away this week none of you would know except for Michael would know Jan but she passed away this week as well she actually if I remember right sister Jan passed away on my mom's birthday 27th so I believe it was the 27th one of the two but I believe it was sister Jan passed away on my mom's birthday 27th I didn't tell Gary that but Gary mom we knew them back my mom and dad back from when we very first came in the message uh new Brother Gary he's married to a different woman at the time but I knew them knew him very well and got to know his sister jammed very well when I was traveling back uh administering for some there in Beaufort they were attending church there Brother Gary and sister Jan made quite a pair uh for instrumentals they could both play a guitar about as good as I've ever seen anybody in person play they were tremendously talented of course Brother Gary still is but I think they had sister Jen's funeral yesterday but please remember Brother Gary uh in prayer again he's had some health issues he's been in the hospital a handful of times with heart issues I think a lot of people thought maybe Gary might go first but his wife did I think she came down with cancer and it took her so please remember them in prayer if you would amen anyone else have a spoken request or something on your heart welcome it was good to see you cool sister Julie was the only one over there I should have some neighbors anyone uh have a book report I haven't unspoken requests today let's stand to our feet if we could and then we'll remember these needs these requests appreciate the Lord giving the safe journey back and amen I'm still missing a piece of luggage but it's supposed to be delivered this afternoon but good flights and good work times so appreciate the Lord keeping us safe and healthy so brother Dennis would you take these needs to the world Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads in unison of the faith knowing Lord that another year has come forward my mind and as our brother has said many people making resolutions they're going to eat better they're going to lose weight they're going to do this and that and because they're doing it they fail my father May there be a sincerity from the depths of our heart Yes to Jesus dedicate Our Lives to you yes to draw closer to you Lord may your Holy Spirit work in a stronger than ever before that you'll bring us to the place of a stronger prayer life of a dedication of coming to church knowing that your word says oh God yes forsake not assembling ourselves together the more so as you see that day approaching amen and this Paul was speaking today of your second coming and how the enemy's fighting harder than ever before Lord keeping people away from the word away from your truth oh Lord we cannot do it in our own we cannot rely on our own abilities we'll fail you but father it's your work you started in us that you'll complete until that day and Lord help us to recognize that we cannot do nothing right we cannot be a good Christian our own the more we try the more we'll fail but Lord greater heareth in us it's your life in US Lord it really blessed my heart in 1948 I hurt your prophets say that it has to be Jesus Christ in you bringing you in subjections yes it has to be Christ alone it has to be you Lord having complete preeminence yes Lord It's like another year and it's like Peter said one time that some have mentioned where is the promise of this coming for everything seems to remain the same as our fathers fell asleep oh lord the devil knows his job but father he knows what it'll take to keep us away from you away from your word but father it's your work in us that give us ability to overcome to stay with your word and Lord there are many that are sick this morning that need a healing touch yes you know each and every one you know what they have needle father we are standing on your promises as as brother Brown says God wants you to take him at his word to believe that what he said it will come to pass as the word says if two shall agree it's touching anything it shall come the best amen be light yourself in the Lord he'll give you the desires of your heart and Lord we claim victory over these sicknesses over each and every one that needs a touch from you father Yes for you are our high priest we're going to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your strength we are healed and Lord everyone else said my need a financial touch might need a spiritual awakening I need a uh a touch with their sanity and then maybe they're going through a depression you can lift them up you can grant us more than what their hearts desire yes amen oh Lord we are here to rededicate our lives to you yes Lord we OSU versus redeem the time for the days are evil and Lord we cannot do in any way Overlook that because they're more evil than there ever been oh no since I've been alive almost 70 years and Lord help us to recognize the day and the hour in the message you have sent to get up right ready amen bless each one that raised their hands give them their hearts desire may their Joys be full may they they testify that you truly came on the scene and bless them Father yes with what they desire from you granted Lord bless our pastors to bring forth your word Lord use them to speak to our hearts to receive your Word of Life this morning in your name we pray name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord you could be seated if you'd like amen I'm going to go over to song number 372 and then we'll have it on the screen here my sins are gone praise the Lord aren't you thankful for that hallelujah our sins are gone by the blood of the Lamb yes amen thank you Jesus you asked me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and when I meet the sculptors [Music] as far removed as Darkness video God forgiveness that's good enough for me praise God my sins [Music] [Music] my sins are gone possessions as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea us for me when [Music] something is peace [Music] [Music] but Jesus dropped me out while they're underneath [Music] is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] amen [Music] praise God blessing at last person is

Lord amen they are gone amen buried annihilated wiped away never to be in the memory of God again Satan remembers and he'll try to get you to remember but in the mind of God they're gone never existed praise the Lord you go to God and say God forgive me of something God forgives you you go back and say well God forgive me God looks and says forgive you of what nothing there amen praise the Lord amen glory to God my sins are gone by his Precious Blood buried annihilated completely wiped away they go back to the head of Satan where they lay on till the day of judgment because he is the accuser of the Brethren yes he is the one that makes you guilty it is him is the one that brought this whole bottle of Roland in the Garden of Eden so it all goes back to him amen he tries to make you guilty of it praise the Lord and unfortunately those who don't accept the blood of Jesus Christ for their perpetuation they will still live under that but those who receive the blood of Jesus Christ and God annihilates those sin it goes right back to the devil you are Guiltless and he is guilty and say look at what he did God says that's on you buddy that's your that's your doings amen praise the Lord aren't you thankful God it's just so good his word is beautiful pure amen praise the lord well we got a new year anybody got a testimony in your heart go ahead sister Norma amen we don't have the mic to pass around so for the sake of those who may be listening on the online you've had a high fever and his breathing his soul so there runs away to the hospital hi Jonathan my grandson and his wife and I made that to the hospital they waited this for a little while the nurse came out and checked his temperature before they let him in and just breathing was normal the temperature went down amen God touched that boy praise the Lord that is so good yes [Music] praise the Lord let you know where I came from but where I'm at now God is a miracle word amen that's the truth amen has really been a change statement yes my mind praise the Lord I remember when my had my sister's funeral my sister was kind of aroused about when she was younger and teenager and uh she was ah she was almost uncontrollable actually um and then when she found the Lord the Lord changed her life and all the friends that she had had back then and all the things that she did and had one person that came to her funeral that I remember very vividly now others came that knew my sister over all those years and she got up and I believed she had told me personally it's been years ago but she had told me personally and she got up I can't remember now she got up and spoke one way or the other and she said that's not the one I knew she was a different person than the one I knew back in the day back years ago in her teenage early 20s whatever that's a Janice was a different person at my sister a different person at that time and it's only because of the grace of God Amen my sister Norma said you look back in your life and you saved mine where would I have been without the grace of God amen without his Mercy in my life am I so Lord anybody else what testimonials grandson my grandson can be used to love the Lord and therefore sometimes for the unforeseen reason he became very isolated um suicidal and homicidal and it was a horrible burden to my daughter and isolated um didn't visit anyone and um one day I visit them and I saw the demon yeah tell my daughter because me and her we prayed for the meat for her son yes we were afraid that he was like with somebody or kill them or killed himself um and I gotta say it we believe that he's been delivered amen amen all day in fact he spent the night on Christmas day which is so unusual nice yesterday and he's just like a different person amen praise the Lord what a horrible burden this was for us sure always we were always so stressed out that he would do something terrible yes but now he even has a job amen amen amen yes he has glory to God wonderful God is so good the one thing missing and all that stuff that's going on you hear about the killings and the homicides as you said and the one thing that's missing is a caring mother or grandmother something to go and lay hands on that cast that demon off he used to love to come to church so that's my next next step yes amen praise the Lord Next Step thank the Lord Jesus anyone else beautiful brother yes I wanna give glory and praise to the Lord last night Leah says you know we need to bring the New Year in with a time of prayer together and we prayed and you know and just we've dedicated ourselves to the Lord and I believe Leah has a good prayer life it's getting stronger but there's something I guess it keeps me humble she fights this word and she fights this truth and there's a friend that you're quite aware of and you've talked to her salad she called me a few days ago and I believe she's truly searching but Leah can be a real something about to her but I I believe the more she prays God's going to reveal himself to him and let's pray uh together that this will happen soon yes yeah because there's also someone else that really uh tops to leonette Sally but she has confidence in yourself and just confidence in me he's blessing yourself when she prayed and rededicated her life amen praise the Lord amen that's good to it's good to get to try to help her yes amen she said she's going to try to come to service sometime so I hope she does I hope she does be good to see her again I think we met her one time yes you met her anyway is you get went to a different large denominational Church you could probably guess I'm not going to call its name just destitute and needing some help and needing some counsel and so Lord just intervened and spoke to her and blessed her heart so she feels a lot better and like I said she's planning on coming to church yes so I look forward to that maybe that'll be the End Road to get Leah to start to come yes amen Ralph's coming back and praise the Lord I believe all of God's children are our families yes anybody else yeah yeah I'm a good example when I first started coming to church I wasn't sure the good thing about you know you have to keep coming and praying and listening to the word just God puts in your heart if you really want to learn about the message you will amen I stuck with it because I love the word of God the true meaning amen Amen to Something in you it'll call to you yes you know if it's not there it won't speak to you right if there's that germ seed that's there when that word hits that seed it'll it'll cause something to happen yes you know even if you might not understand it or even if it seems out there somewhere or far-fetched or whatever doesn't matter it just keeps pulling because you know there's something is real it's true foreign [Music] no I see it in your heart buddy I do see it in your face yeah I really believe you love the Lord amen so I'm glad to Grace the Lord God is moving amen we're late in the hour but God is moving Anarchy settling in on our country but God is still moving anybody else amen I didn't have I wasn't going to spend a lot of time in uh so we got testimonies if you want to testify let's go right ahead real quick real quick here I know that somebody would bring for Ronnie and more so than well he came home I think it was last Sunday or Monday and we walked in I mean you know what he said I came home and I have a home and I have he was so grateful and I believe God it started a workout yeah so that's what praise the Lords amen I believe it too my prayer and confession anybody else you know I want to cut it short I like I said when I did this I didn't plan a very lengthy service for today and it was New Year's Day but I didn't want to cancel either nobody else and we'll just stand to our feet amen and go to the scripture here we're going to go to the new beginning part 13. uh I think again uh I I thought about something that maybe would be as you'd say appropriate for a New Year's service day and I thought well then I felt my heart I thought what better than there would be for a new beginning yes uh again kind of where we're at here and what's going on is a new beginning a new beginning in our lives a new beginning in the year A New Beginning in the world the country um everybody always kind of looks at New Years as they roll over into New Opportunities and new chances and that's why I always you know say that the this you year bring you happiness and prosperity and blessings above measure new year new beginning so we're going to go back to that and part 13. so let's go to Genesis again chapter 1 verse one and two as we read that as our beginning scripture for this series Genesis chapter 1 verses one and two but before we do let's just fire our heads again for another word of Prayer amen Lord Jesus we're very thankful father again for 2022 we're thankful God for the gains we're thankful for the losses we're thankful for what you've given us and thankful for what you've taken from us Lord yes because we know what you may have taken from us Lord isn't gone forever lord it's like job Joe was doubled in everything that was taken from him except for his children knowing that his other children were on the other side waiting on him so he was still doubled even in them because they were there waiting on him so even at those things Lord that happened in our lives in the year that we look back and reflect upon we realize it can see so much more in retrospect how your hands have been Upon Our Lives Lord how you've led us and guided us and blessed us and helped us and we come to roadblocks we come to narrow tunnels and we come to tunnels that didn't seem to have a light at the end of them and so many things in our lives Lord and here we are again and we can give you thanks and praise and glory Lord knowing that you've brought us through every one of them we may yet still be in certain situations God that we don't understand we may still be in a tunnel that we don't see the end of the the light at the end but we know God that you are the light and you bring that light to our lives even if it's just one step at a time yes God bless us with your word today speak to us from it may your Holy Spirit have the preeminence once again in this service and Lord just breathe on us through this place as you wave through it as you did on the day of Pentecost and Lord Lift us up and bring us to that place Lord of power and demonstration of your spirit Lord to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or even think Lord bless these that have come Lord bless those who may be listening watching Lord streaming today God may your hand be upon them as well and Lord I pray that you'd have whatever your perfect will would be to be said here Lord through these lips heard through our ears and Anointed God to to bless us and to come a part of our lives and Lord just to grow more like you every day yes I believe we're staring down the end of this road Lord and staring down the end of time and Lord where I believe that we as a brider about to go home I said this last year I said it the year before I'll say it this year I believe this is the year of the coming of the Lord yeah amen and if it doesn't happen this year Lord I will be looking for you next year yes even more fervently yes Lord so may you bless us now this beginning of this New Year 1 1 23 God may you bless us and strengthen and help us again for this journey and for this word and this service here today we commit it to you we rebuke every demonic spirit that try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done and we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen in Genesis 1 1 and 2 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen you could be seated that beginning men as we've said many times that beginning was the beginning that we know of as a beginning although God himself never had a beginning but we as humans can't fathom not having a beginning so as the scripture begins in us as Mortals uh so that we can tag something to it a beginning point in the beginning so that's where we're at here in our new beginning and the new beginnings that we've talked about from the beginning of this series amen now the last time uh we had gotten through uh Gog and Magog we had gotten through the burning over of the earth amen and the purification of the earth and red word the scripture talked about it where brother Brandon mentioned that even the atmospheres would explode every germ every disease every sin everything that has anything to do with Satan or uh uh the the sin and degradation of life will be completely wiped away purified annihilated and God will come and set his kingdom upon this Earth yes but before he does that there has to be that time of judgment and that's the time that we're at here now so we go to Revelation chapter 20. again we're going to start with verse 7. and we're going to start into the white Throne judgment there's going to be probably two or three services uh that would incorporate these few scriptures here before we actually get into the new city there's several nuances and things that I feel to talk about that are in this portion of the scripture here so we're going to begin with verse 7 Revelation 20 and verse 7 so I will background just a little bit as we did with Gog and Magog uh beginning with verse 7 as we read here and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of hoon is as the sand of the sea again quite a large number of people when the scripture describes them in such a number that there would be as the Sands of the sea amen that's a lot because you it would have a very challenging time to go out to the ocean and try to count the Grans of grains of sand that are on the ocean uh just as it would be for the people that are going to be at this time obviously it's just an analogy of what it the the numbers will be but people sometimes uh forget about the fact that uh how our population has just grown here under normal circumstances uh I looked it up and in 1900 uh which was a thousand years ago approximately they were there was about uh less than two billion people on the earth how they know that I don't know because I don't know how you could count that considering we didn't have all the technology that we have today but that's what the statistics say there was less than two billion people and now in the year two thousand one thousand years later there was over 6 billion people in a thousand years it gained over 4 billion people just under normal conditions of Satan's Eden including pestilence and famines that killed people by the millions of wars that killed people by the thousands see those things won't exist at that time Satan will be locked away germs diseases the the wars and all those things that this would be a time of Peace even to those that are outside of the city it'll be a time of Peace uh but they continue to multiply they continue to grow and get to that place on a normal normal circumstances it grew 4 billion now in the past 20 years it's grown another 2 billion just in 20 years so because we're right at 8 billion I think is it so uh that it the Earth is getting to the place that it is unsustainable for the number of people that are here uh if you if you go down now and all the people that's moved into this Valley into Phoenix and Tucson and and the dry areas and you can go down to Yuma and see where the river used to go down through the Colorado River used to go down between Arizona and California and go and flow through uh Yuma down into Mexico it's a trickle now but you can see the walled Banks like what it used to be huge used to be a huge flowy River but all that water is being sucked out now I don't know what the poor people that were depending on it down in Mexico I don't know what they're doing nowadays but it's getting to the places really becoming unsustainable but you see how the population can multiply you see well how could it be the Sands of the sea well we look right here it can be because uh the procreation just continues and continues like it would be as the Sands that are on the sea went up upon the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp the Beloved City that camp of the Saints about and the Beloved City but then fire as they encamped around it that fire of God came down and devoured them all amen we read where brother bam said the bride those that are in that Millennium Place that beloved city as it said who are taken away again uh that God just completely Burns that's my opinion doesn't say here I don't know that brother Brown that I can find any way that there's a specific time that brother Madam says that that actually happens but we no one have seen scripturally it could not have been before the Millennium and obviously we know it's not going to be during the Millennium so the place that I believe that this uh complete purification as II Peter tells us is going to happen is going to happen after the Millennium at this time where God rains down from heaven this fire and brimstone it it it destroys him annihilates them but then it completely changes the Earth again completely changes the Earth even under the Earth will be exploding and all the gases and the the you think these volcanoes you see around in uh Hawaii and things or something and people gasp at those this that that's that's a toy compared to what's going to happen when this whole earth begins to belch underneath it and explode from the bottom up uh it's going to be quite a destruction but it's got to be that way because the fire is what purifies everything even today we know fire is a purifier uh back in the day years ago my parents if they wanted to purify a needle for some reason uh that it was we're gonna use your skin or something for alcohol on it and then they put it under a over a lighter or or a flame not a lighter my parents didn't smoke but but we did have Flames lighters things for for fire and they would and they would purify that needle with fire that's that's how they did I guess they got all kinds of different ways now to do it but fire is the best purifier there is so the fire is going to completely purify the Earth change the earth set the Earth back upright again it's going to be in its perfect condition and state just like God intended before even the Garden of Eden the way God intended it to be amen is going to be at that place brought back to that place again 10th first now and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beasts and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever now notice we know that that does not happen and it cannot happen as a just God until after the Judgment God doesn't judge anybody even Satan to hell until he actually gives them a fair judgment yes amen which is what the white Throne judgment does so you you notice that the scripture and you but you've got to know the scripture enough to follow the flow of continuity in the scripture to know that when when a man like John writes this and God allowed people like John the Revelator to write Revelations to to bring it in a way that it would confound people because if you read this just on face value you would think that at that moment in time is exactly when it happened but when you bring into context of their scripture and you recognize the kind of deity that God is that he doesn't he doesn't pronounce judgment on anybody except first that there is a a judgment amen there's got to be a God's got to find that person the place to be able to receive a fair trial before he sentenced them God's not an unjust cause and he's going to have a fair trial before he sentences anybody even the devil amen who at one time of course was brother man said was God's right-hand man he was the cherubim he was an angel that was created by God that turned Lucifer that turned into the red dragon the devil uh the Beast uh all these things so if you I think that's honestly I I personally think that's where a lot of people get confused even in the seals uh that's a whole nother series and a whole nother topic but to me when you hear people preach about that and things that come off of that uh you can recognize look I I I'll just say I've heard people teach on the seals and and when I hear some things that said and and God rings that Bell to me that you know brother green always told us that's the Holy Ghost now listen but I still call it that Bell that's in me when it goes off then I go and I look now something's not right because what he's saying doesn't flow in the continuity of scripture right it has to flow in continuity of scripture or it can't be right right God is not he's not going to put the cow in the tree picking grass uh he he's he's not gonna uh grow potatoes out of an oak tree uh God has a way of doing things he created it and he started it and it flows in the continuity it is in even to body like an animal life and it operates today just like it was when God said let there be it operates today the same way outside of the fact that the fault changed things after the fall they changed but they continued to operate in the same way because they were created by God the scripture is the same way amen Heaven and Earth will pass away the scripture cannot and that pass away is again Heaven and Earth will change from one form to another we just talked about that the atmospheres will even explode yes the atmospheres the Earth Heaven and Earth will change we'll we'll pass away or be changed but his word cannot change yeah so it's got to flow in the continuity of the scripture if it doesn't something's wrong right and there's nothing wrong with the message and there's nothing wrong with the scripture so where's the problem it would be neat or you or whatever your interpretation or whatever that Minister that person's interpretation of that scripture is it has to flow in the continuity of the scripture and the only way to know that is to know the scripture is to know the word that's why we are to read and pray and amen search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life see we know what the continuity the flow of the scripture is and how God operates and this is if we put God putting them in Hell before there's a trial that does not flow in the continuity of scripture right it doesn't flow with the personality of the way that God is who he is and how he operates it doesn't and if you look at a lot of other things that that people try to bring about and say oh it sounds good you know and you can try to fit it in there and oh my yeah that six seal fifth seal seven seal and the coming of the Lord and those things if you don't get it into the continuity and flow of scripture and the way that the scripture all the way through not just one quote not just one scripture not just something out of uh out of one message that brother Brandon may have been talking about could it possibly be like uh services this the time uh a soul is in prison now then we get the scripture out of continuity you can't do that right amen my point in saying that is that this here as it says that they were cast into the lake of fiber and so yes but not right then amen not as the continuity not as this scripture is reading yet because there hasn't been a white Throne judgment yet amen do you understand that's that's that probably may be a long way around but it was something that was burning in me to try to get across to understand me you can't you look at it and say well that's what the Bible says but if you don't follow it when the Co in the continuity of the entirety of the scripture you get it out of place amen and we must not misplace the word yes Amen brother around it's one of the must not we must not misplace the words we gotta place it where it belongs amen now let's keep going 11th verse and I saw a great white Throne judgment now it's being set up here I saw a great white Throne judgment a great uh White throne and him that sat on him from whom's face uh whose face the Earth and Heaven fled away people still do amen you mentioned God to a lot of people today they don't want to hear it amen ridicule you put you down old-fashioned whatever they want to say flat away and there was uh there was found no place for them now a couple of references one is when I believe it's Ephesians tells us that we are to give no place for the devil yes Greg that no place means that in your life the the devil would have no place to infiltrate you in your life don't give place to the devil don't allow your life to be operated or lived in a way that it allows the devil to come and do something in your life or or influence you a certain way or or try to get you to do something you shouldn't do or something to that effect don't even give place to them don't open that door to where Satan can come in and and confuse you or get you to doubt or to get you to disbeliever to get you to sin or do something you know you shouldn't do don't even give him the opportunity the other place is in Revelation 12. when Satan took unpreached to a third of the angels in heaven and deceived them and there was war between Satan and Michael there came a place that when the devil lost that battle that Dragon lost that battle there was what no more place found for him in heaven amen what does that mean he had to fall down he had to be diminished or brought down from his position of cherubim light bearer right-hand man of God he had to so in in that economy of Heaven there was no more place for him he could not it's like can I make I can make it a little carnal let's just make it a little carnal for a minute if there's a job opening at a corporation and there's a hundred people apply for that job only one person is going to get that job out of 100. well you go and apply and let's say it's for a machinist a person who knows to operate a how to operate a certain machine or certain machines or something and you come in and and they say uh well what experience have you had oh well I've dug a couple of ditches uh I I you know I I drove for Uber for a while okay well what qualifies you to operate this 20 million dollar machine I just want to no no there's no place for you at this company there's no place for you at this job amen you don't qualify that make sense there's no place found in heaven for Satan anymore there was a place for him at one time when God created him and he was Lucifer he had his position he had his placement but when there was no place found in heaven he was what him and his angels were cast down on the Earth amen now we see here the same verbiage and there was no more place for them there's no more position for them to hold there's it's just like in the Millennium when Satan was bound by the chain of circumstance why because there was no place for him there was nobody he could operate in or work through so there's no place for him well here the finalization of it at the white Throne judgment him that sat on Whose face that heaven uh the earth and the heaven fled away and there was no place found no place for them no place so you've got a position here you got the Bride of Jesus Christ you got his children the Jews and the hundred and forty four thousand and you've got those that are uh well we'll get to it and you had let's just say this scripturally you have that place for the wise virgins the bride you had that place for those 144 000 the Jews those that are blinded you had that and you had that place for the foolish virgins they have their place I understand but here those that come forth that did that do not fall in either of those categories there's no place for them so what happens when there's no place found for them they're cast down just like Satan and his angels from Heaven to Earth they are cast down to a lower position and where is that that's their final resting their final judgment I say resting they're not going to rest it's their final place of judgment right it's it's it's it's the fire of God that God created people say hell I'm trying to avoid the word of hell because Hades in the Bible just means uh uh uh grave and as we start continue to read through this scripture it becomes very Paramount to understand that the vernacular that we use in the scripture for hell Hades just means the grave amen so I'm trying to get us to see when it talks about the lake of fire and brimstone that place where God sends those that have no place there's found no place that they didn't fall into this category they didn't fall into this category they didn't fall into this category so there's no place for them right what happens when there's no place for them they go to a lower region what's the lower region that's left from here the lower region that's left is the lake of fire and brimstone that's all that's left unfortunately there'll be people that fall under that category just like Satan just like the Beast just like the false prophet they will all be cast into that Lake of Fire just like those who have who there is no place found for them unfortunately the same place now we know um that in verse 5 I want to go back to verse 5 real quick before we continue on we know that in verse 5 also at the end of this Thousand Years let's just read it at the end of the Thousand Years the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished amen now the bride those that are in the Millennium they come up in that first resurrection or they're a part of that that they go into the Millennium from the bride's supper or wherever it may place them see uh they're the ones that are in that place and the others that die lay in the grave lay in that place of waiting wait in the regions of the Lost because it weren't bride uh for that thousand years so the rest of them uh lived not until the thousand years were finished but after the thousand years are finished is the resurrection of the rest amen the rest of the Dead that are resurrected at that point after the Thousand Years then all of humanity comes forth everyone that was ever born everyone that ever came forth comes to this place now all human every knee about every tongue will confess is not an acronym it is a fact amen it is something that will happen and take place because notice we'll read a scripture in a minute God placed into the position of Jesus Christ now people want to make him a different person no the position of Jesus Christ into that place of judgment different for for uh reasons that we'll get to in a minute but that position that God had the position of the son Jesus Christ do the judgment because the bride his wife is there in judgment with him she sets with him in that throne one reason God does that as the son do it the other is that he was the kinsman redeemer amen and the body of Jesus Christ as he was here on Earth became our kinsman redeemer now I find it sometimes challenging when you try to counsel people and and probably all of you at some point uh adults have tried to help somebody or counsel somebody who's grieving or has lost a loved one or a a job or or finances or something you try to help them or console them or or talk to that person uh counsel them in some way sometimes it's hard you say well I know how you feel you know uh you you probably don't I know how they feel but that becomes like the go-to line that people say well I know how you feel now people what our our first son passed away we had a lot of that people would come up and say oh I know how you feel and most of the time I was very gracious and understanding and say I appreciate that sometimes I'd say have you lost a child right well no well then how could you how could you possibly understand how I feel okay amen do you see what I'm saying yes Jesus Christ walked in this earth in a body of Flesh as our kingdom Redeemer he suffered loss he suffered sickness he suffered or what it is Humanity uh know about sickness but hunger uh he knew what it was like to not be wanted he knew what it was like to be rejected by his own people he knew what it was like to sleep outside without a pillow or a blanket he knew what it was like to be invited to a party that nobody wanted him at he knew what it was like he knew what it was like to have a headache why because somebody shoved that crime of thorns and pierced into his skull he knew what it was like to have a backache because he drugged that however many 100 pound cross up a cobblestone Road he knew what it was like to be whipped and beaten so when you go to him and say Lord help my backache he knows exactly how you feel right won't say Lord help my headache he knows exactly how you feel you say Lord help me in my lost he knows exactly how you feel Lord help me in my destitute he knows exactly how you feel help me with the friends or family and people don't love me he knows exactly how you feel he's been there he's been through it amen he knows how you feel so the son is in place it's placing in Trust of that place of judgment because he knows he's been there and people come forth and say but there's no buts every human ever walked this ball of dirt had the same opportunity as you and I do to receive him everyone amen a few received him like us many reject him they didn't want him and they could come up with all excuses they want but but Jesus knows amen he knows he's been there he's gone through it amen so when even a foolish virgin comes forth I'm getting a little ahead of myself because I didn't want to talk about this until later but even when a foolish virgin would come forth and remember Revelation uh Matthew 25 well God separates the sheep from the goats that's not the bride the bride's not the Sheep separated the bride is setting on the throne with him yeah in judgment yes right that's not the bride right that's the foolish virgin yes that setting there that God and God gets to the understanding of that person and that person's life or what they did or how they gave maybe even the tribulation they they now there's foolish virgin in every age so people talk about the foolish version almost like it's only going to be through the tribulation no no there's foolish virgin in every age but just for example if they gave their lives in Mortimer they sealed their testimony with their blood during the tribulation one of those scenarios Jesus would understand that see he's a just God he's a fair God he's a reasonable God he God's yes he is a god of wrath and judgment but God's a god of compassion and love too amen his his Jesus the Bible said that Jesus the man Jesus personal will his human will same as mine wish that nobody would go to hell that everybody would come to repentance I wish the same thing Jesus wished that that was in his by his will but he doesn't predestinate based on his will he predestinates based on his foreknowledge right he knew before it ever began who would and who wouldn't thus the predestination of God by election stands only way it does stand not by his will if it was by his will it be like my will the native everybody could but it has to be a just thought only way he can be a just God amen now when these people come up from from that a lot from that second Resurrection having been in the holding Place regions of the loss for that Thousand Years in Bodies In The Grave he said and I saw the dead small and great stand before God you say well that Bible just says they stood before God well so where's the prize well isn't she become him amen you read all through the scripture you can see when it talks about a king and a queen very rarely does it talk about a queen being there he said he well what is she she is just a representation of him she has just become him she's just an extension of him so when it mentions him it's mentioning her at the same time whether it verbalizes it or has it here or not when it says him it's talking about him and her and we'll prove that scripturally in a few minutes step before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and we'll the books which we have talked about it in the past I believe we were probably on the portera at the Cortaro Church um but I want to go through that again a little bit maybe not in the same detail and talk about these books again so that'll be a whole nother service so just hold that and wait the books were open another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their Works written in those books are the works of the individuals and the individual will be judged in the same body that they did these works The Works will be in the book the person will be judged in the body by which they were judged by and by which they committed these acts the things of life that God writes down and Records amen these books will be open and they will be judged out of those books brother random even talked about uh at a point that a a screen will come up and somebody said well uh they might try to make an excuse or try to say well this didn't or that you know someone said you see it right here and play it right back for them to see it for everybody's standing there to watch and see exactly what happened and how it happened probably even to the intent of the person's heart or thoughts that that did the act right because it's a judgment it's a place where nothing is hid friend in that light nothing is here the deep dark secrets of an individual's heart will be exposed will be revealed will be made known there's no place to hide there's nothing you can hide even in the depths of your heart or in the back of your mind it can't be held it can't be hid from God it'll be revealed it will be shown and they will know amen they'll show out of these books that God has written and again we'll talk about that later according to their words amen now according to their works well we'll just get to the other in a minute and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the dead and death and Hell delivered up the dead because remember death and hell were both conquered when Jesus Christ died he went to hell he uh and he rose from the dead he conquered death and Hell and then he had he had the keys of death hell in the grave because he conquered them so as he conquered them death and Hell delivered up the dead they what because they could no longer hold them because the bill that was due when Jesus died at Calvary has now come due the the act that Jesus performed at Calvary that purchase our Redemption even though we're still in these sin bodies comes to comes due here Satan can no longer hold grips on him Satan can no longer hold grips on the earth because the blood of Jesus Christ dripped on this Earth and bought it back he can no longer hold claims on us on this on the word on life of of anything he has no rights to anybody at all even the ones that he deceived in the following him he has no rights to them death and Hell have to give up the Dead because they were conquered which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell now were cast into the Lake of Fire which is the second death amen death and Hell Now cast because they've been conquered they've been done away with so when we get over to this new city amen death one exists the grave won't exist these things will be devoid from our lives because they they will they no longer exist only those that God had created this Lake of Fire for and those that are in it will be uh in that place in that position now it won't be for eternity uh we may talk about this greater in length at another time but death uh hell is not forever people you hear people say well uh you know people live eternally in Hell they'll they'll they'll they'll burn eternally no they won't no hell was created and anything or say the Lake of Fire was created and anything that has been created will have an end yeah yeah amen anything that's created has to have an end to it if it had a beginning it has to have an end amen only thing that is eternal is something that never began and the Bible says that God created hell for Satan and his angels his followers well if it was created it can't last forever and if a person in hell has eternal life they should be in heaven not in hell because the only form of eternal life there is is God's light and how you're going to have God's life and be in hell right right amen so it can't be Eternal that might be for years and thousands of years it might even be a a very long extended period of time as the Bible tells us it is but it won't be Eternal right it won't continue perpetually just in existence it can't it will be done away with at some point everyone that's in it and the Lake of Fire and all itself will be annihilated at some point will no longer exist amen because it can't because it was again created the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them they were judged every man according to their words and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire now I want to go to another scripture and and bolster this point Daniel chapter 7 Daniel chapter 7. I just read it a couple of verses here and then I want to get to one main point that I want to drive home today and then we'll we'll uh close but Daniel chapter 7 verses 9 and 10. Daniel 7 9 10. I beheld to the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit on the white throne whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire now notice brother Ram talked about this hair whitest wolf from Revelation and he called Jack Moore and asked you and he said well that was his glorified body and brother Branham said that didn't ring brother Branham said that didn't ring the bell so I guess it's okay for me to say too he said that that just came to me he said that didn't ring the bell so he said I went to prayer and I started asking God and seeking the scripture find out and find out that that was God in his place of judgment amen that was Jesus in his place of judgment like the judges the old judges of of England in those places they before they went out to their judgment seat they put on a white wig right uh that I don't do it anymore but they used to of course we don't follow scripture in anything hardly anymore even to the point of do not steal but they used to wear a white wig amen and when when when the Lord revealed this when when God showed this to brother Brandon he saw it then it become a place of Judgment at that point no longer Grace see because at that point Grace had ended it was nothing but judgment and as a judge he wore the white woman he was the white uh garments the white wig the white his hair was white as snow was in a place of judgment as he was judging pure wool and the fiery flame his throne and the wheels movement is all the wheels just means uh as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him who would that be that'd be the bride Amen ministered on him Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands stood before him so thousands of thousands ministered but tens of thousands and tens of thousands stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open now you you see the place set up as God sets it up how long it takes I have no idea but we will have because the white Throne judgment I if I remember right now I didn't look this up again but if I remember right brother Brown tells us the whitetown judgment is still a period of time even after the millennium we don't enter into eternity until after this point okay so because time still has well okay well thank you Lord time still has to exist because there's people there that are in time bodies they're they are they are not Eternal creatures because they're going to be cast into the Lake of Fire so there we go but we now are are in this place this white that's been set up so how long it takes again nobody knows scripture doesn't say uh but it it'll be whatever time it'll be that God has that he has set up but it'll be a place now where these ten thousands of ten thousands come before Christ and his bride those that are ministering to him amen just like just like a wife would do her husband amen just like a wife would take care of minister to her husband the wife the bride ministering to Jesus the bridegroom amen he that sets on the throne amen will be there with him ten thousands of ten thousands will be before him and the Judgment then is set judgment is ready to go and God judges everyone as we just read here judges each one out of that book according to their words amen according to their Works judgment is set up for all the for all but the bride because the bride has already been judged and been found guilty that's the last point I want to drive home here today let's read this in the god a question to answer is God being misunderstood 1960 when he said now question was about five it just says five virgins he said now with the five virgins lost that's not really an appropriate question he should have said the five foolish virgins but that's the question brother Brown said I pursue they're asked the question the five virgins the five wise and the five foolish now if you were with us in the last teachings in Revelation you find out uh those five foolish virgins were not lost virgins were not lost but they were not permitted to go to the wedding supper those are part of those that were the Thousand Years in the grave until the white Throne judgment they were not permitted to go into the wedding supper but they suffered persecution and was martyred and raised again at the general Resurrection in the last day at the at of course at the white Throne judgment those are the people those are the people where he separated the sheep from the goats they stood before the Judgment you say well brother Brown Don't We Stand the bride the church no sir we do not stand before the judgment praise the lord we are now standing before the judgment praise the Lord God put our sins upon Christ but again those that rejected Christ and the blood of Christ those sins still lay on them and are written in that book the book of their works that they had done in that body while they were here it's the only chance they have we have been born again the bride has become new creatures in Christ we no longer because we accepted Jesus Christ and his shed blood for our Redemption and for our perpetuation so we now have already been judged and found not guilty if we had not been found not guilty he would never have put his spirit if we were still guilty he would have never put his Spirit God doesn't come and put his his holy spirit in a filthy place very much so if it was judged and still found guilty God would have never God would never come and put his spirit in a filthy vessel amen so if we've been under judgment and found not guilty did God put his spirit in US the token the ticket that gets us out of here that puts the bride in the position of being bride and in the rapture because of his spirit because he found her not guilty praise the Lord put our sins upon Christ at the grave of course but then when God but when Christ went to hell because as a result of that he conquered death in Hell praise the Lord which put those sins back on Satan yes praise the Lord oh it's beautiful he that heareth my word Saint John 5 24 believe him and sent me had eternal life and shall not come into the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life amen look at this the first seal notice the rest of the day the church members dead church members live not again until the thousand years and then at the thousand years they were gathered another Resurrection come which is the second Resurrection he's talking about those that come forth the dead that lived a thousand years in the second resurrection and get that understanding now those other than the bride the 144th out of those that are in the millennium beloved City everyone else that's still in that waiting Place reasons the Lost wherever those people come forth after the Thousand Years every one of them that were there come forth after that thousand years they're still in that waiting that is the second Resurrection and they were gathered and Christ and the bride he said not the church the bride Christ and her and his Queen not the church Christ and the bride stood there Christ and the bride now you say stood there he just means they're there he doesn't literally mean we were standing there because he's on his throne and we're in the throne with him amen so he says stood there again you can't take it to the actual literal of the word you got to go back to the scripture and see this is what he's talking about he didn't mean they stood there so okay I you know sometimes you just you just gotta it seems silly sometimes but people take things like that and they run with it make a Doctrine out of it and make it all things it shouldn't be and that's what I was talking about earlier about the seals and stuff and they take it and don't search through the scripture or know the scripture at all right Define the continuity of what the scripture is and what scripture says right so anyway well he said it right there yeah he did but you understand and they were separated like the she ETS that's right there's the church members come up and if they heard the truth and rejected the truth then what's going to be said when that big thing spreads across the canvas he's talking about that spreads across the canvas when even your own thoughts will be there Amen on that great screen he calls canvas here great screen that shows forth that shows every bit of it even to the very thoughts your own thoughts will be there what you thought about in fact we know of course through brother Branham and brother green told many many times your thoughts speak louder Before the Throne of God than even your words correct amen I got that right amen so our thoughts will even be there what you thought about how are you going to escape it there on that canvas of the Skies God's Great television there's there's your own thoughts he says rebelling you right there your thoughts speaking against you at that time my help us Lord but thank God for his blood see because even even those thoughts get annihilated and wiped away right amen those things that Satan's try to put on you know Satan will give you a thought yeah and it can be a bad thought it could be a horrible fall it could be a filthy thought and he'll have you repentant for that thought when Satan's want to put their start with is to get behind me Satan gifty behind me Satan that's not my thought that's your thought you put in my mind because remember Satan still has access to your mind the mind is still flashing can't corrupt he still has access remember we talked about that service one time uh brother random talked about uh giving the devil the opportunity he said to uh Satan took the Mind God took the heart amen and that mind you'll put stuff in your mind you'll be repent for stuff you didn't even do right you didn't even think about oh God I'm sorry no just cast down reasonings amen and what the scripture says is cast down those reasons they get thee behind me that's not my fault and just and move on Amen honestly you can repent if you'd like I'm not telling you not to but you really don't have anything at that point to repent for what are your thoughts now if you entertain it and you act upon it or something that's different but if it's just a thought Satan puts in he say get behind me Satan and you move on with your normal Godly life and there's not even anything to repent for wasn't your thought Satan put it there it's his thought amen now let's go over I want to read I want to uh bring you three scriptures and drive this down before we go so let's go to Saint John chapter 5. we already had we already are you ready for brother Brown quoted it Saint John chapter 5. you know what let's go up to the 19th verse uh I got a couple more services on this anyway uh let's go up to the 19th verse I was just going to read one verse of scripture here but I wanna I want to try to back up with the scripture some of the things that I've ministered to you this morning uh Saint John 5 19. then answer Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth those also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that himself do it and he will show him Greater Works than these that ye may Marvel for as the father raises up the dead and quickeneth him even so the son quickeneth whom he will thank God for that very much for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son amen so now we understand C Jesus himself the father judgeth no man but had committed all judgment to the son why all the reasons we said earlier amen somebody can come to you and say oh I know how you feel if you haven't been there you really can't understand how that person feels and even then you can only understand a portion of because that's a different person than you are right they've had a different life different backgrounds they've gone through different things their spirit's different their nature is different so you still even when you say I know how you feel you still it it still kind of you really still kind of don't know because because you're not in their body but Jesus now understands and had committed the father had committed all judgment unto the position the placement of the son Jesus that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he the honoreth not the son honor not the Father which he has sinned verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but is passed from Death unto Lionel you do not come to the judgment he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me how many of those are in here this morning amen half the everlasting life and shall not come what's it saying you right now at this moment you have everlasting life praise the Lord why because his life is in you yes only form of eternal life that there is that germ seed of God that was placed in you from before the foundation of the world now God in you Everlasting eternal life shall not come to the Judgment condemnation is judgment but his past from Death unto life you don't taste second death we might the purchase has been paid but the Redemption has not been fully ex realized yet even though Jesus paid for it we're still in these bodies and these bodies May yet still taste dead we might we don't know what God has in store amen some of us may not even meet if there is a 2024 may not make it I don't know I may be one I don't know but we may still taste that death but because of having eternal life you the real you has already passed from Death To Life so what can death do to you death has nothing on you right praise the Lord amen he's already conquered yes he has and you have already passed have already passed you believe receive his word his holy spirit you have already passed you don't come to condemnation you've already been found not guilty pass from Death To Life amen let me read this first Corinthians a couple more scriptures I said First Corinthians 6 I'm going to go ahead and read dare any of you having a matter against another go to the law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life amen amen if those judgments if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are less esteemed in the church as he begins to explain that and how it should it doesn't but how it should operate in church an assembly of Holy Spirit-filled people amen amen unfortunately so many times you get in places where the serpent seed gets involved and then you've got greed and you've got arrogance and you've got pride and you've got contention and and then you just got a mess that's why people don't want to do it yeah and that's our shame as as bride that is to our shame it should not be that way unfortunately it is but this is how it's supposed to work scripturally this is how it's supposed to be done amen and and for the court so if the bride now if as he said we shall judge the world then where are we going to be how do we judge the world Revelation chapter 3 and I'll I'll close with this I got one more quote but I'll close with this scripture Revelation 3 21 to him that overcome it has eternal life well I grant to set with me in my throne those that are Overcomers those that overcome have eternal life born again will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne so these Throne the Throne of this white Throne that is set up is set up not just for him but for us when you say him when you say the masculine you include the feminist amen when you include when we were married me and my wife we were probably on the cusp of this new woke stuff whatever that involved the minister even a Methodist minister of course my dad had told stuff from the minister to say it was it was one of the funniest things I remember when we were back in the back room my dad told me uh told the guy because it was her parents church so but my dad told the minister he said you marry him in the name of Jesus Christ and he looked at him like a mule looking at him you gave we always say father Son and Holy Ghost no that's what I'm telling you you don't say that when you join them in Union you say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and of course I don't mean I probably shouldn't even say it but you know Pastor got another 20 he'll say whatever he wanted to say but he did say it God we had the video go look and when he pronounced he said follow us on the Holy Ghost two or three different times through the ceremony but when it got to pronouncing us as husband and wife he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and at the end he said I present to you Mr and Mrs George Newton Bennett III that's what he said right why because when he said me he included her that's the way it used to be I don't know what it is anymore but that's the way it's supposed to be in my opinion Mr Mrs George Newton III because when he said my name it included her she's now part of me we're one right that's the way it should be you look in the scripture and see that's the way it is in the scripture and when you say him you say her all right so people will say Miss Jesus oh that's fine but when you talk about him what are you talking about it when you talk about him the bride the groom you talk about the bride that's why Jesus said what they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me yes whatever they do unto you they're doing to me why because we're part of him we're one I don't know how many times brother random tried so hard in the latter part of his ministry to drive that home to us to get us to understand we are one with amen one with him and he has oh and we as Overcomers will be granted to sit with him in his throne know ye not that ye shall judge the world praise the Lord again one more add this one more quote I want to read here I'll close this is uh uh questions uh oh the same one question God's being under uh misunderstood uh here oh I already I already read that it's the same quote uh don't uh brother bear said don't the question is don't we stand uh don't we stand in judgment program said no sir we do not stand before the Judgment we are now standing before the Judgment God has put our sins upon Christ we have passed from Death unto life amen amen so now we got the Judgment we know where this judgment is set you know I accept Christ the son the position of sonship on the throne with his bride his bride thousands of thousands however that equals would be Millions thousands of thousands is in the millions I don't know why because there's no number given to it you say one thousand one thousand anyway and tens thousands of tens of thousands Before the Throne to be judged the books are open The Book of Life is open and all those that come before will be judged according to their words amen there may be somebody come up and maybe what's written there is not very good but it was somebody that you encountered in your life and that person comes up and all this is said and all the stuff is played on the screen and everything that happens and you step forth and say but father when I was on Earth they did this or this or whatever it was that might be exactly what it is in judgment now to be a righteous judgment amen right A righteous judgment but God will look upon that in favor amen because of how that person treated you I'm not saying that that person is going to be given eternal life for that reason that's up to the Lord I know what the scripture says I know what brother Brown says but the Bible says You must be born again but there will be people you know some of the foolish virgins that you may stand forth in favor of and say when I was on Earth I was destitute I was lost I was broke I was suicidal I was whatever and this person came and helped me this person came and gave me life this person came and ministered to me gave me a cup of water and something he'd stand forth and stand up for that person that person may very well just be because of the Judgment that you have through the character of Christ that person grant them a place not in the city but on the outside of the city but with the eternal life it will have life because of you that's one purpose reason of your being there as the bride you remember that Bridle be from the first church each of this church amen that praise the Lord in that judgment the books will be open amen let's stand if we could we know that brother random teaches us that death only changes your dwelling place that's right right amen you say well I do I'll do whatever I want but when I get over there I'll be this and says no you won't whatever you are here is what you'll be over there of course some people if they think they're going to be over there what they are here they won't be over there but death only changes your Dwelling Place amen those you've who go to sleep in that condition with those books open in those work set they'll be that's why they'll be judged in that same body yes because it only it only changed their dwelling place from here to here didn't change your character the only way that happens is if it's done here it's the only way that happens otherwise you're the same praise the Lord God is good amen praise the Lord let's sing this Amazing Grace I think we probably don't sing this song enough but it is amazing isn't it it is amazing praise the Lord [Music] I say glorious like me oh I once was lost but now I'm proud I
