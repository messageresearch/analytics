[39:15] seat stadium
[39:17] but if he's not here

[39:22] here then that can change the whole
[39:24] world

[39:44] you heard the prayer requests different
[39:46] things that was mentioned of course i
[39:48] want to reiterate uh the prayer requests
[39:50] for sister hope uh buckles and the
[39:54] family there but of course especially
[39:56] sister hope with the passing of brother
[39:58] uh
[39:59] brother steve
[40:00] um
[40:02] and since we gathered last actually
[40:06] brother roger's dad passed away
[40:08] since we gathered last sunday we were
[40:10] here wednesday but from sunday brother
[40:13] rogers dad passed away last sunday uh
[40:15] evening afternoon evening so since we
[40:18] actually gathered here last sunday
[40:20] brother rogers dads passed away too of
[40:22] course they went back for the funeral
[40:25] and it just
[40:26] want to talk to brother roger about it
[40:27] we always talk about things like that we
[40:29] always like to talk about how the lord
[40:31] moves things and intervenes in our lives
[40:34] and moves us in certain directions and
[40:36] certain events happen to cause southern
[40:37] certain events to take place and
[40:40] you know
[40:41] brother roger told me yesterday that him
[40:43] and his wife and brother will gates
[40:46] were the only three people at the
[40:47] hospital when steve passed away
[40:50] and the first thing that came to my mind
[40:52] is i'm so thankful that brother roger
[40:56] happened to be back there for his dad's
[40:58] funeral
[40:59] so that him and monica and hope and
[41:01] moniker are pretty close monica hope
[41:04] called monica two or three times a day
[41:06] every day
[41:07] since steve's been in the hospital wow
[41:10] they're pretty close and the fact that
[41:11] they were there to be with hope when
[41:13] steve passed
[41:15] friend could make all the difference i
[41:16] mean just yeah that changed the whole
[41:19] atmosphere everything for her
[41:20] and for and for them so
[41:23] uh i'm thankful that
[41:25] i hate brother rogers i'm sad brother
[41:28] rogers dad passed away he's on his
[41:31] reward
[41:33] and and of course the sadness and the
[41:35] morning that it brought to brother roger
[41:37] and his family but uh i'm so thankful he
[41:40] was there
[41:41] uh brother roger had his dad's funeral i
[41:43] said this at the breakfast yesterday but
[41:45] for those who may not
[41:47] know but brother roger went to his dad's
[41:50] funeral friday
[41:52] went to a family gathering friday
[41:54] afternoon and then went to the hospital
[41:56] to see steve when they lifted the
[41:58] restrictions for visitation
[42:01] went to see steve he died that night he
[42:04] passed that night
[42:06] just
[42:08] you just never know
[42:10] who could orchestrate any of this any
[42:12] better than the lord yes
[42:14] it
[42:15] god is just so good
[42:17] amen
[42:18] even
[42:19] even in soldiers of the cross going on
[42:22] to be with him and the sadness and the
[42:23] mourning that it brings
[42:25] who could have made this any better than
[42:28] what it was in the lord amen i tell you
[42:32] i've said this before i say it again
[42:34] i've told other people i said you can
[42:36] live whatever life you want to live
[42:38] friend but
[42:40] even if there is no heaven even if there
[42:42] is no god even if jesus was a hoax even
[42:46] if every bit of it is a fallacy
[42:48] which is of course a light from hell but
[42:51] even if it were i still contend this is
[42:53] the best life to live
[42:56] i still believe that i still would
[42:58] rather be here than in a bar somewhere
[43:02] waking up to next to a strange person or
[43:05] with a gun in my hand because i just
[43:07] gambled away all my entire living right
[43:10] and sitting in the car deciding whether
[43:11] to blow my brains out or not i'd rather
[43:13] be here than any of those places
[43:16] hospital police station jail sick
[43:20] drunk
[43:21] high on drugs
[43:23] i'd rather be here in this life than any
[43:25] place i know of
[43:27] amen
[43:28] i still contend it's the best life to
[43:30] live
[43:31] amen
[43:33] praise the lord i believe that i really
[43:35] do
[43:36] but i'm so thankful that even with that
[43:38] after all of it the best is yet to come
[43:42] praise the lord the best is yet to come
[43:45] amen you have your bibles turn with me
[43:48] to first thessalonians chapter 4.
[43:52] we're going to read this scripture one
[43:53] more time
[43:57] amen as i as it was that i kind of
[44:00] thought it would be
[44:01] i felt loved yesterday that we'll we'll
[44:04] wind up the rapture series with this
[44:05] message today
[44:07] amen talk about the trump
[44:09] and uh
[44:11] not a trump b trump amen
[44:14] not president trump but the trump of god
[44:17] yes amen
[44:19] praise the lord although i do believe he
[44:20] was put in office of god right but we're
[44:24] talking about a different trump here so
[44:26] a lot of times we'll probably try to
[44:28] refer to trumpet
[44:30] because i'm thinking if i mention the
[44:32] word trump too many times on youtube
[44:34] we're going to get flack
[44:36] so
[44:37] i probably try not to say that
[44:40] any more than have to we'll revert over
[44:42] to trumpet and so
[44:45] amen might even get flagged at that i
[44:46] don't know
[44:47] but anyway we'll read this one more time
[44:49] in this rapture series uh with this
[44:52] message today won't be very long um i i
[44:55] i had a
[44:57] i'll just be honest i had just like the
[44:59] first just like to shout in the boys uh
[45:02] this just became overwhelming and
[45:05] and it was a decision to either take it
[45:07] for two or three days two or three
[45:08] services or just simplify it make this
[45:11] it and that's what i felt led to so
[45:13] that's we'll just leave it there and uh
[45:15] just trust the lord to bless it today
[45:17] amen first thessalonians 4 now
[45:20] again before we read the word let us bow
[45:22] our heads forward a prayer
[45:25] precious lord jesus
[45:27] father it is a privilege to be here
[45:28] again this morning as it has been sung
[45:31] as it has been prayed as it has been
[45:32] testified we're so very thankful god
[45:35] that you are with us that lord you put
[45:37] the desire in our hearts to be here and
[45:39] that you guided us to this place once
[45:41] again today
[45:42] sure we had the time set in advance lord
[45:46] we have the place set in advance and we
[45:48] knew all of this was going to be going
[45:50] on but lord it still took a desire it
[45:53] still took an unction it still took a
[45:55] pull
[45:55] in our lives to bring us here this
[45:57] morning lord god i'm thankful that that
[46:00] pull has led us to this place and
[46:02] brought us from the desire of our heart
[46:04] lord to learn more of you to come into
[46:07] this place and to feel your presence to
[46:09] know you to be real once again god in us
[46:12] and lord to explain that to other people
[46:15] is
[46:16] is pretty near impossible lord but if
[46:18] you just feel it one time you know it's
[46:20] real right and lord we've felt it
[46:22] multiple multiple times we know that
[46:25] you're real we know that you're here we
[46:27] know you're going to do the exceedingly
[46:29] and abundantly above all that we could
[46:32] ever ask or think
[46:33] we thank you lord for those that have
[46:35] come those who may be streaming lord may
[46:37] you bless us exceedingly lord bless this

[47:16] have you to be ignorant brother
[47:17] concerning them which are asleep that
[47:18] you sorrow not even as others which have
[47:21] no hope
[47:22] for if we believe that jesus died and
[47:24] rose again even so them also which sleep
[47:27] in jesus will god bring with him
[47:30] for this we say unto you by the word of
[47:32] the lord that we which are alive and
[47:34] remain
[47:35] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[47:37] prevent them which are asleep for the
[47:39] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[47:41] with a shout
[47:43] the voice of the archangel with the
[47:44] trump of god and the dead in christ
[47:46] shall rise first
[47:48] then we which are alive and remain shall
[47:50] be caught up together with them in the
[47:51] clouds to meet the lord in the air so
[47:54] shall we ever be with the lord wherefore
[47:56] comfort one another with these words
[47:59] amen you can be seated if you like
[48:03] amen last
[48:05] uh going back to verse 16 here
[48:08] last couple of sundays um we went into
[48:11] the shout the voice
[48:13] as we read here and we find that brother
[48:15] brahm teaches us that the lord does all
[48:17] three of these on his upon his
[48:19] dissension
[48:20] as uh he's descending it comes forth to
[48:23] shout
[48:24] there comes forth a voice
[48:26] and a trump amen we talked about the
[48:29] shout the shout being of course the
[48:30] message
[48:31] get the living bride together those that
[48:33] are alive and remain talk last sunday
[48:36] about the voice the voice of the
[48:37] resurrection the voice that shines that
[48:39] spoke out resurrected lazarus from the
[48:42] dead
[48:43] resurrected those old testament saints
[48:45] from the dead that voice of the
[48:47] resurrection crowd again to rouse
[48:50] together and bring up and bring and
[48:52] resurrect those dead bride saints from
[48:56] the first church age through that has
[48:57] gone on to be with the lord to come and
[48:59] be with us and present themselves and be
[49:02] with us for a minimum of 30 days yes
[49:04] amen shout the voice now the trump the
[49:07] trump of the the the trump that finishes
[49:10] up the trump of god
[49:12] amen that that uh that completes this
[49:15] series of of threes of the shout the
[49:18] voice of trump the three steps that
[49:20] takes us into glory amen now now the
[49:24] trump the trump of god
[49:26] is what calls us all so we have a
[49:28] gathering together of the living and
[49:30] alive remain group we have a calling
[49:33] together of those that are resurrected
[49:35] from the dead and we're all together
[49:37] here and now the trump is what sounds to
[49:40] bring the entire body bride into a
[49:44] rapture
[49:45] to a wedding supper of the lamb
[49:48] that's what the trump is to be for the
[49:50] trump is to call us to that place that's
[49:53] all gathered together under the shout
[49:55] and under the voice we've all been
[49:57] gathered together we're all here we all
[49:59] present ourselves and are together here
[50:01] again for a minimum 30 days and then
[50:03] that trump when that trump sounds we all
[50:06] go to the wedding supper of the lamb the
[50:08] gentile bride to go to meet the lord in
[50:10] the air which is the
[50:12] gathering place that god has for us has
[50:15] been said a table a thousand miles long
[50:17] and wiped the tears from our eyes and uh
[50:21] used to have a picture we probably still
[50:22] do somewhere that table a real long
[50:25] table that's set up a lot of you've
[50:27] probably seen it in chairs chairs lined
[50:29] up and just to think about what that's
[50:31] going to be like amen millions upon
[50:33] millions of people together amen to get
[50:36] fellowship together at that wedding
[50:38] supper that gathering place that time of
[50:40] coming together amen now
[50:43] to get into this again i'll i don't
[50:46] intend to be very long but just uh
[50:48] however the lord leads here now the the
[50:51] to get into the trump now that trump
[50:53] that calls us
[50:54] into the air to meet the lord in the air
[50:57] to go to the marriage supper of the lamb
[50:58] brother madam said down here in the
[51:00] message
[51:01] uh the rapture we're going to uh revisit
[51:04] these couple of things as he says here's
[51:06] therefore
[51:07] the message calls the bride together the
[51:11] shout out amen
[51:14] and the same one he said and with a loud
[51:16] voice he screamed out shouted with a
[51:19] loud voice that woke lazarus when he
[51:21] cried lazarus come forth see it woke him
[51:24] up and that shout that voice wakes up
[51:27] the sleeping bride the sleeping dead
[51:30] and the trumpet with the sound of a
[51:32] trumpet and when it does listen now when
[51:35] that trumpet sounds always brother brown
[51:38] said always a trumpet called israel to
[51:41] the feasts of the trumpets now israel
[51:43] being the type and shadow we've used so
[51:46] many times and of course that we bring
[51:47] back over into the new testament into
[51:50] the gentile bride we recognize that god
[51:52] did so many things in types and shadows
[51:54] back there in the old testament and the
[51:56] laws and levitical uh feasts that god
[51:59] brings it back over to this day now when
[52:02] you start getting into those levitical
[52:04] feasts it can take days to bring out and
[52:07] that's why i chose not to do that but i
[52:10] do want to get into specific points of
[52:13] this that bring us to this trump rapture
[52:17] amen this calls this bride to a rapture
[52:21] amen this is what does it now he says
[52:23] now a trumpet called israel to the feast
[52:26] of trumpets or to their feasts amen but
[52:30] brother branham specifically denotes
[52:32] feast of trumpets because it wasn't a
[52:33] little more than a year before this
[52:35] brother branham preached feast of the
[52:37] trumpets right believing that those
[52:39] trumpets were going to be to the
[52:41] gentiles brother branham said he was
[52:44] going to try to get an auditorium like
[52:45] he did
[52:46] uh this the church ages he had and took
[52:49] the whole week and the seals and took
[52:51] the whole week he's going to do the same
[52:53] thing with the plagues the vials the
[52:54] trumpets uh but then the lord began to
[52:57] show him that these trumpets here were
[52:59] like the seals to the to the uh jews
[53:03] right amen amen but this particular
[53:06] trumpet though again like we talked
[53:09] about last week was what uh god is using
[53:12] to call this bride home amen now
[53:16] god brother branham is just typing those
[53:18] trumpets god brother graham's just
[53:20] typing those feasts and those feasts of
[53:23] trumpets to the trumpet that's going to
[53:26] sound to take the bride home the gentile
[53:28] bride home yes
[53:30] so he says now always nice as always
[53:32] trumpet calls israel to a feast a feast
[53:35] of trumpets see which was a pentecostal
[53:38] feast the great feast in the sky the
[53:41] feast of the trumpets and now a trumpet
[53:44] uh
[53:45] do announce a calling together
[53:48] come to the feast
[53:50] so that's the that's the that's the
[53:53] bottom line takeaway
[53:55] from this uh sounding of trumpet or
[53:59] trumpets
[54:00] is
[54:01] it calls people to come together it
[54:04] calls them to come to the feast amen
[54:08] that's that's the whole point of the
[54:09] trumpet the bottom line uh point of the
[54:12] trumpet is to come to the feast yes amen
[54:15] that's what it's supposed to be for so
[54:17] when the trumpet sounds that last
[54:20] trumpet last trumpet of god not trumpet
[54:23] of an angel
[54:24] not the trumpet of a man but the trump
[54:26] of god
[54:27] is to call this bride to that feast yes
[54:31] amen that's what it did old testament
[54:33] and now that is
[54:35] for us now that is the lamb's supper in
[54:39] the sky
[54:40] now watch the assembling together the
[54:42] bride feast of the trumpets wedding
[54:44] supper we've seen it in times now watch
[54:47] just for a moment he's talking about
[54:49] there is he closed that now as brother
[54:52] branham is talking about those feasts
[54:54] let us help try to understand this uh a
[54:58] little bit better by going over to
[55:00] leviticus chapter 23.
[55:03] and we'll read just a couple of portions
[55:05] of it here
[55:10] amen recognizing the sounding the trump
[55:15] sounding of a trumpet
[55:16] remember
[55:18] now brother branham says it here in a
[55:19] later quote i have but remember last
[55:21] week we talked about when paul mentions
[55:22] in the first corinthians when he was
[55:24] talking about the gifts of the spirit
[55:26] when he was talking about speaking in
[55:27] tongues prophecy
[55:29] giving words of edification exhortation
[55:32] or ministering he talked about the the
[55:35] speaking in tongues as the trumpet
[55:38] giving an uncertain sound now of course
[55:40] there's several places in the old
[55:42] testament that deal with the same thing
[55:45] not just these feasts because there are
[55:47] certainly trumpets that are sounded for
[55:50] different reasons through the scripture
[55:52] especially the old testament that denote
[55:55] specific things that's why again like we
[55:57] said last week
[55:59] that paul said if the trumpet gives an
[56:01] uncertain sound how will the people know
[56:03] what to do how will they know how to
[56:06] gather themselves how will they know how
[56:08] to attack how will they know whether
[56:10] it's retreat or attack right because you
[56:13] know in war there's uh
[56:15] there's different uh soundings of the
[56:17] trumpet that meant different things even
[56:20] in
[56:21] some of our i don't know if they do it
[56:22] anymore but some of our more modern day
[56:25] uh war
[56:27] uh there's been trump as revolutionary
[56:29] war and there was a sound of attack
[56:32] if the trumpet blew there was a sound
[56:34] that main attack right
[56:36] if a trumpet blew there was a sound out
[56:38] of the trumpet that meant retreat
[56:40] well if you're confused about what the
[56:41] sound is you might be attacking when
[56:44] you're supposed to be retreating and
[56:45] you're going to die
[56:47] because the chances are you're headed
[56:49] into a horrible place where the enemy is
[56:52] slaughtering you
[56:53] so if you get them confused and you
[56:55] don't understand what they mean then
[56:57] they can they can put you in a bad
[56:59] situation they can cause death
[57:02] injuries whatever you have to know what
[57:05] the trumpet means what the point of the
[57:07] trumpet is
[57:08] if it gives an uncertain sound that
[57:10] people don't know what to do
[57:13] we went over to uh had our little
[57:15] vacation in san diego i'd get up early
[57:17] in the morning and go out on the balcony
[57:19] and was a little chilly with the wind
[57:21] blowing but it was nice with a cup of
[57:23] coffee and a sweater and i could i could
[57:25] hear them blow revelly at the naval
[57:28] station across the water
[57:29] that was so neat listen to the revelry
[57:32] uh being blown in the military base
[57:34] there across the acro and see they all
[57:36] know what that means i don't know what
[57:38] it means i don't you know
[57:40] i'm not asking now it's not the right
[57:42] time to ask but what revelry is i don't
[57:44] even know wake up uh go here do this i
[57:47] don't know come to breakfast i'm not
[57:48] sure what it meant but it was neat to
[57:50] hear anyway but see if they're trained
[57:53] and they know what it means when it
[57:55] sounds and it sounds properly they know
[57:57] what it means and they know what to do
[57:59] they know where to go they know what to
[58:01] take with them they know what to be
[58:03] prepared for
[58:05] because that trumpet is sounding and
[58:06] it's sounding the specific sound it's
[58:08] supposed to and everyone is trained to
[58:10] understand what that sound is that's
[58:12] right what to do about it well when
[58:14] these trumpets sound that they're
[58:16] they're the different trumpets for the
[58:18] different purposes and different reasons
[58:21] amen i won't go into that any much more
[58:23] brother branham does in a later quote
[58:25] we'll hit that a little bit more but in
[58:28] leviticus chapter 23
[58:31] and in recognizing of course this this
[58:33] is the same thing and you know you
[58:36] god could have used a drum
[58:38] uh god could have used uh
[58:40] uh
[58:42] something else i mean i don't know but
[58:43] the trumpet is the loudest most
[58:46] controllable instrument in my opinion uh
[58:50] a a drum is loud
[58:52] and you know and you could beat it a few
[58:54] times to make it but but but a drum
[58:56] doesn't make a different sound you can
[58:58] make all kinds of sounds with the
[59:00] trumpet right i should have mike bring
[59:02] his trumpet
[59:03] uh you can make all kinds of different
[59:06] sounds of the trumpet all kinds of
[59:07] different notes all kind of different
[59:09] blasts and everything you can do and
[59:10] it's really loud right trumpets are very
[59:14] loud uh trust me when my practice
[59:16] trumpets are very loud uh fortunately he
[59:19] got real good at it quick but anyway uh
[59:22] they're very loud so they can be heard
[59:24] so when they reverberate through a
[59:26] valley or through a desert area where
[59:28] there's little obstruction people all
[59:30] around can hear it
[59:32] people can hear that trumpet from from
[59:34] long distances
[59:36] amen you can have a drama beat and
[59:38] drum's kind of loud but you're limited
[59:40] as in as to the uh uh the number of
[59:44] sounds you can make from a drum a drum
[59:46] just basically makes one sound
[59:48] you could you could tap it a different
[59:50] way but you know if you hit tap tap tap
[59:54] tap or something like and and
[59:56] and somebody a little distance away said
[59:58] when it was that two caps or three
[1:00:01] well then you're confused again
[1:00:03] god's not the ultimate confusion there's
[1:00:05] going to be no confusion right
[1:00:07] and but with the trumpet there's no
[1:00:09] question
[1:00:10] uh it's so loud and so pronounced that
[1:00:14] it it's
[1:00:14] easy to distinguish
[1:00:17] leviticus 23 now uh god talks about
[1:00:20] these things the lord's faith unto moses
[1:00:22] saying
[1:00:23] speak unto the children of israel and
[1:00:25] say unto them concerning the feasts of
[1:00:27] the lord which ye shall proclaim to be
[1:00:30] holy convocations
[1:00:32] even these are my feasts
[1:00:35] amen now what's a feast
[1:00:37] a feast is something you have where
[1:00:39] people come and gather together right
[1:00:42] you come and you bring everybody
[1:00:43] together those that have an invitation
[1:00:46] those that have a uh uh
[1:00:49] have been asked they
[1:00:51] they are the ones that come together to
[1:00:53] this feast
[1:00:54] if they're part of that family or if
[1:00:56] they're part of that group or that
[1:00:58] company
[1:00:59] if they're a part of the family of god
[1:01:01] uh that calling is a calling them to a
[1:01:04] feast
[1:01:05] and that's what god said these are the
[1:01:07] feasts that i want you to have they are
[1:01:09] even holy convocations
[1:01:12] and that convocation is nothing more
[1:01:14] than a sacred gathering right
[1:01:16] a sacred sacred gathering now you can
[1:01:19] see why brother branham
[1:01:21] led us back here when he talked about
[1:01:22] the trump of god that was calling the
[1:01:25] bride to a wedding supper because it's a
[1:01:28] sacred gathering
[1:01:29] it's a sacred coming together it's a
[1:01:32] holy convocation a bringing of a
[1:01:34] gathering together to the feasts where
[1:01:37] god wants to uh to to supply to us like
[1:01:40] he would at the marriage supper of the
[1:01:42] lamb
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:44] six days shall uh
[1:01:46] six days shall work be done
[1:01:49] but the seventh day is the sabbath of
[1:01:51] rest and holy convocation ye shall do no
[1:01:55] work therein it is the sabbath of the
[1:01:57] lord and all your dwellings and that's
[1:01:59] exactly what it will be for us saints
[1:02:02] amen there will be a rest
[1:02:04] god will call us home and we will rest
[1:02:06] from all of our labors yes we'll set
[1:02:09] there and you can understand i mean i we
[1:02:11] could all understand why there might be
[1:02:12] a tier or two drop from our eyes and
[1:02:15] sitting there and thinking about it just
[1:02:16] resting and realizing that there's no
[1:02:18] more toil there's no more struggle
[1:02:21] there's no more fight there's no going
[1:02:23] to be there's not going to be any more
[1:02:25] losing of family members or passing on
[1:02:28] i'm going to be in more mournings or no
[1:02:29] more graves very
[1:02:31] dug and no no more sirens to listen to
[1:02:34] ringing through your apartment at night
[1:02:36] and there's no there's not going to be
[1:02:38] any stillborn babies all that's going to
[1:02:41] be done away with and just to set there
[1:02:43] when that all-in-consuming spirit comes
[1:02:45] into you and you start beginning to
[1:02:47] think of how could you not drop a tear
[1:02:50] that's right but jesus will come and
[1:02:51] wipe them all away amen amen said it was
[1:02:55] well done praise the lord entered into
[1:02:57] the joys of the lord and you sat there
[1:02:59] at rest
[1:03:00] it's a time of rest right it's symbolic
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:05] it's a time of symbolism of of of of
[1:03:09] rest of a peace of a settlement it's
[1:03:12] been it's been tried out it's been done
[1:03:14] it's been finished and now it's a rest
[1:03:17] yes amen you know what it feels like
[1:03:19] sometimes and you know
[1:03:21] people coined that tgif for a reason
[1:03:25] i don't know if it matters anymore
[1:03:26] because so many people work on saturdays
[1:03:28] and sundays anymore i don't even know if
[1:03:30] tgif exists or even hunt day which used
[1:03:33] to be wednesday where people would get
[1:03:35] to friday and they go
[1:03:36] i get to rest now
[1:03:38] my labors of the week is over now i can
[1:03:40] enter into a weekend where i don't have
[1:03:43] to have this on my mind now even if
[1:03:45] there was other things to do
[1:03:47] even if you had to pull weeds or
[1:03:49] or whatever chores you might have had on
[1:03:51] a saturday or something even with that
[1:03:54] it's still different
[1:03:56] than knowing on your mind and your
[1:03:58] spirit that you've got to get up and
[1:04:00] it's so and so a time you've got to be
[1:04:01] at a place and you got to go and and and
[1:04:04] the grind is there as they call it
[1:04:07] the the the job grind is there
[1:04:11] that grind is lifted you know of course
[1:04:14] yeah if you love what you're doing and
[1:04:16] you really enjoy your job then it's not
[1:04:19] so much a grind but for most people it's
[1:04:21] not that way but you understand how that
[1:04:23] rest enters in you feel that rest you
[1:04:26] can see the symbolism of that rest maybe
[1:04:29] brother john when you finish a job
[1:04:31] you finish a job and you get paid and
[1:04:33] you can take a little rest you feel like
[1:04:36] a weight's lifted yes and it's just
[1:04:38] that's just a microcosm just a small
[1:04:40] symbolism of this that we're talking
[1:04:42] about of why god is calling us to that
[1:04:45] to that feast
[1:04:47] to that holy convocation to that
[1:04:49] gathering where we all gather together
[1:04:52] and we we come together and that trump
[1:04:55] calls us to that supper and we have uh
[1:04:58] we had that time together of rest with
[1:05:00] the lord jesus all our friends all our
[1:05:02] family people we may not have known but
[1:05:04] saints from the dark ages and all
[1:05:05] through
[1:05:06] we get to set together at that supper
[1:05:08] and enjoy it amen and rest
[1:05:11] have a rest
[1:05:12] praise the lord
[1:05:14] this holy convocation
[1:05:16] the sabbath it's a rest it's a rest
[1:05:19] these are the feasts fourth verse of the
[1:05:21] lord even holy convocations which he
[1:05:24] shall proclaim in their seasons amen now
[1:05:28] as that trumpet called to the feast
[1:05:31] that trumpet is what is is the
[1:05:34] significance that brought them to that
[1:05:36] place
[1:05:37] amen now in feast of the trumpets which
[1:05:40] is what brother branham preached uh as a
[1:05:43] result of the lord showing him that this
[1:05:45] was for the gentile for the jews
[1:05:48] he he brought it down to just a simple
[1:05:50] message instead of taking a seven part
[1:05:53] series uh that would have been more
[1:05:55] significance or importance to the
[1:05:57] gentile this was for the jews so he laid
[1:06:00] it out because of scripture needful for
[1:06:02] us to know to a point but it wasn't as
[1:06:06] necessity as something that was strictly
[1:06:09] for the gentiles
[1:06:11] for us for this last day bribe which was
[1:06:14] which was which was his message right
[1:06:16] that was brother brown's message
[1:06:18] remember the shout gather us together
[1:06:20] yes amen the shout was in particular now
[1:06:23] each one again that received their shout
[1:06:25] of their message for their age
[1:06:27] they played their part they'll come up
[1:06:29] too but that shout out to that message
[1:06:32] of
[1:06:32] of this last day wasn't for all of them
[1:06:36] it was for us it was for this last day
[1:06:38] it was for this this group that was to
[1:06:41] pass on of course but that was to be an
[1:06:43] alive and remain group too it was
[1:06:45] supposed to be something to bring her
[1:06:47] enough rapturing faith that would change
[1:06:49] our bodies one day yes amen that we
[1:06:53] would be ready and have the rapturing
[1:06:55] faith to go beyond this mortal reach yes
[1:06:59] and to expect that hallelujah
[1:07:02] amen that message it was brought to us
[1:07:04] so brother and preached feast of the
[1:07:06] trumpets
[1:07:08] it was july 1964 he did preach an
[1:07:12] outstanding mess
[1:07:13] now
[1:07:14] i i will say this and give just this
[1:07:18] smackling of a warning
[1:07:20] i have heard
[1:07:22] different what i considered rogue
[1:07:24] doctrines come out of the feast of the
[1:07:26] trumpets and i believe that is because
[1:07:31] brother branham preached this because
[1:07:33] these were to the jews
[1:07:35] not the gentiles and when people start
[1:07:37] misapplying them right then they can it
[1:07:39] can muddle up the whole gentile picture
[1:07:42] it can muddle up the whole picture of
[1:07:44] our time and our day and what the lord's
[1:07:47] doing for us yes and i think that's kind
[1:07:49] of maybe some of what happened amen but
[1:07:52] it has to come from the lord so if god
[1:07:55] god keeps a god called minister straight
[1:07:58] god keeps his children straight and
[1:08:00] we're going to stay straight on his word
[1:08:02] regardless it's all got to meet the
[1:08:04] middle of the road yeah amen i i brought
[1:08:08] brother david over here yesterday and
[1:08:09] showed him a church and david fritz and
[1:08:11] and we were talking a little bit and you
[1:08:13] know i said there's we were talking we
[1:08:16] always end up talking doctrine but we
[1:08:18] were talking about some things and he
[1:08:20] mentioned some things he'd heard and
[1:08:21] stuff and you know and and and i told
[1:08:24] him i said there's there's things i'll
[1:08:25] mention that uh that i feel the lord has
[1:08:28] revealed to me that brother babe didn't
[1:08:29] say or that you can't specifically
[1:08:32] pinpoint in the scripture yes i do but i
[1:08:35] always caveat that with you do i not
[1:08:38] i always caveat that with you to let you
[1:08:40] know now this i don't find this in the
[1:08:42] message i don't find in the scripture
[1:08:44] this is my opinion this is what i feel
[1:08:46] the lord has revealed to me
[1:08:49] and i'll let you know that you have to
[1:08:51] know that course you have to work out
[1:08:52] your own salvation anyway right but i'll
[1:08:55] let you know that i don't i haven't
[1:08:56] found it now what i do do
[1:08:59] now then this is the point i'm trying to
[1:09:00] make here what i do is
[1:09:03] if i feel like the lord has shown me
[1:09:05] something i don't just take it and run
[1:09:07] with it i check the scripture and make
[1:09:09] sure what he's showing me is scripture
[1:09:12] right because of what he's showing me or
[1:09:14] what i said well brother man didn't say
[1:09:15] it but i feel the lord revealed this to
[1:09:17] me but if i can't run it through the
[1:09:19] scripture
[1:09:20] what i feel the lord show me if it won't
[1:09:22] go through the scripture then i still
[1:09:24] leave it alone right yes i still don't
[1:09:26] want to if i can't if i can't verify and
[1:09:28] legitimize in the bible what i feel like
[1:09:32] the lord showed me then i still don't
[1:09:33] touch it right and i believe that's the
[1:09:35] whole that's the whole point of it see
[1:09:38] if
[1:09:38] it's not through this scripture leave it
[1:09:40] alone
[1:09:41] amen that's what it boils down to see
[1:09:44] and that's i'm afraid that's what a lot
[1:09:46] of people get to uh in the breach
[1:09:49] of first seals you know when brother
[1:09:51] brown preached the breach which a lot of
[1:09:54] confusion comes from the seals weren't
[1:09:56] even opened yet right or they weren't
[1:09:58] even revealed i should say not even to
[1:09:59] brother brown but the adam had received
[1:10:02] brother madam had not received the
[1:10:03] revelation of the first seal when he
[1:10:05] preached the breach right he had not
[1:10:07] received a revelation of the second seal
[1:10:09] when he preached the first right and on
[1:10:11] and on and on and on that's why you see
[1:10:14] later in his ministry in the next uh the
[1:10:17] following subsequent couple of years
[1:10:20] things that uh might actually
[1:10:23] seem different than what he had in like
[1:10:25] the breach
[1:10:27] or or the seals
[1:10:29] you know he talks about in the breach
[1:10:31] about the the lamb taking the book the
[1:10:34] intercessory leaving the mediator seat
[1:10:37] and no more blood on the mercy seat
[1:10:39] and a lot of people run with that so
[1:10:41] there's no more blood on the mercy seat
[1:10:43] but if you listen later on in in the
[1:10:46] messages remember the
[1:10:48] brother man was talking about what the
[1:10:50] scripture said not that it was happening
[1:10:52] that second right right but then as he
[1:10:55] goes on through in his ministry you hear
[1:10:58] him several times say well if there's no
[1:11:00] blood on the mercy seat god don't even
[1:11:02] hear your prayers right yeah well then
[1:11:04] what do you do how do you reconcile the
[1:11:06] two
[1:11:06] a lot of people say well mercy's only in
[1:11:08] the bride and this that and the other
[1:11:10] and uh but but i want you to know i'm
[1:11:13] god's bride and i still need mercy amen
[1:11:16] right
[1:11:18] i still need blood on the mercy seat yes
[1:11:20] i'm not the mercy seat although i can
[1:11:22] offer mercy to others right that blood
[1:11:24] still has to be there for me yes the
[1:11:27] prayers i prayed here this morning i
[1:11:29] expect god to hurt him
[1:11:31] and according to the message he didn't
[1:11:33] if that blood's not there right
[1:11:35] do you see how
[1:11:36] things can get all scrupled up
[1:11:38] you know sometimes it just
[1:11:41] i i think sometimes we just take this
[1:11:43] radical idea and just drop it off and
[1:11:45] take this radical idea from there and
[1:11:47] just drop that off and just come and
[1:11:49] meet there's going to be a truth in
[1:11:50] there somewhere brother man talked about
[1:11:52] that's why we i preached a few years
[1:11:54] back scripture means scripture right
[1:11:56] right because there's there's a bringing
[1:11:58] together somewhere
[1:12:00] his brother graham said armenianism had
[1:12:02] a truth but not all truth calvinism had
[1:12:04] truth but not all truth but both of them
[1:12:06] if you brought them together had an
[1:12:08] absolute truth because there's an
[1:12:10] absolute truth somewhere yes and that's
[1:12:12] where we want to be
[1:12:14] amen
[1:12:15] feast of the trumpets now but around
[1:12:17] again
[1:12:18] to the to the jews but brother branham's
[1:12:20] typing here
[1:12:22] notice the trumpets that we're speaking
[1:12:24] of is a call together for either now now
[1:12:28] brother brown gives these different
[1:12:29] examples a call together for either a
[1:12:32] feast for war for a person or some
[1:12:34] sacred day or something
[1:12:36] so there's different reasons each one of
[1:12:38] these feasts
[1:12:40] each one of these feasts of trumpets
[1:12:43] there's even a feast of trumpets amen
[1:12:46] after the feast of pentecost
[1:12:48] right you ever notice that's a there's
[1:12:49] the feast of pentecost leviticus 23 uh
[1:12:52] uh 15 16 17 there's a feast of pentecost
[1:12:56] and then you got seven sabbaths which
[1:12:58] would be the time for the seven church
[1:12:59] ages and then you had the blowing of the
[1:13:01] feast of the trumpets right amen yeah
[1:13:04] the feast of pentecost the birth fourth
[1:13:07] of the gentile church and from that time
[1:13:10] to this time today there's been seven
[1:13:13] church ages and there's about to be the
[1:13:15] blowing of a trumpet right to take this
[1:13:17] bride home and then immediately oh i
[1:13:21] love this immediately after the feast of
[1:13:24] the trumpets
[1:13:26] there's the feast of atonement
[1:13:28] which is exactly what the jews are going
[1:13:30] to receive after the wedding supper of
[1:13:33] the lamb we go we get our trumpet and we
[1:13:35] go home right amen but now here there's
[1:13:38] a feast of atonement that takes place
[1:13:41] for the jews
[1:13:42] and they receive their messiah
[1:13:45] praise the lord it'd be beautiful
[1:13:47] maybe i should have taken two or three
[1:13:49] services anyway it it's just beautiful
[1:13:52] but now look he's telling us here again
[1:13:54] there's the trumpet that sounds for
[1:13:57] calling
[1:13:58] a feast war person sacred day but notice
[1:14:02] each one of these particular things that
[1:14:04] the trumpets calling for is still a
[1:14:06] gathering of people
[1:14:09] it's still a coming to
[1:14:11] gathering of people amen amen to a feast
[1:14:15] war feast person sacred there something
[1:14:17] he said notice you say for a person
[1:14:20] yeah or for the year
[1:14:22] for the year of jubilee the announcing
[1:14:25] of the coming of freedom
[1:14:27] at the jubilee trumpet
[1:14:30] there is a there's a liberation there's
[1:14:32] a freedom the trumpet blows to liberate
[1:14:36] these people
[1:14:37] and if they who want to be set free of
[1:14:39] course
[1:14:40] they don't want to be set free they take
[1:14:42] it all bore holding their ear and
[1:14:43] they're slaves to the rest of their
[1:14:44] lives but after the 50 years all the
[1:14:47] property was gone has to come back to
[1:14:49] its original honor anybody that was
[1:14:51] taken indentured servant or slave has to
[1:14:54] be released and given their freedom all
[1:14:56] that happens at the jubilee right well
[1:14:58] there's a trumpet for that that's what
[1:15:00] brother brown said it could be for a
[1:15:02] specific person
[1:15:03] if you hear that trumpet blow and you
[1:15:06] know what it means
[1:15:08] then you know what your rights are
[1:15:10] you know what the trumpet blow means you
[1:15:13] know where you're standing you know what
[1:15:15] your rights are you know what that trump
[1:15:18] is being blown for and you know it's
[1:15:20] speaking to you amen and if you were a
[1:15:23] slave like we all were
[1:15:25] and that trumpet were to blow and you
[1:15:27] know what the blowing of that trumpet
[1:15:29] meant to you then you knew that you had
[1:15:32] the opportunity to go free
[1:15:34] praise the lord
[1:15:36] when that trumpet blew in your life you
[1:15:38] knew you had the opportunity to go free
[1:15:41] and you took it
[1:15:43] rather than have your ears bored with a
[1:15:45] hole in them and slaves the rest of your
[1:15:47] life to the devil you decided to go free
[1:15:50] and be liberated because who the lord
[1:15:53] has set free is free indeed right amen
[1:15:57] you had that opportunity but you had to
[1:15:59] understand what was being blown
[1:16:02] they had to understand had to know what
[1:16:04] was being blown what did this trumpet
[1:16:07] mean
[1:16:08] if they didn't know they could be a
[1:16:09] slave's wrestler yes
[1:16:12] unknowingly you mean i had the chance to
[1:16:15] go free and you didn't take it
[1:16:18] mike did you imagine all that day saints
[1:16:20] we get to that place and people they're
[1:16:22] going to be people saying you mean i
[1:16:23] could have gone free
[1:16:25] yes and you turned it down right yes sir
[1:16:28] right mine that's going to be a bad day
[1:16:31] for a lot of people
[1:16:33] a horrible day
[1:16:34] oh my
[1:16:36] announcing the coming of freedom when
[1:16:38] you could go back now and you could
[1:16:40] complete mourning uh on just one thing
[1:16:43] but now getting into the trumpet he says
[1:16:45] you got the background now of the seals
[1:16:47] and the church ages
[1:16:49] now we're going into the trumpet the
[1:16:50] trumpet sounded and a trumpet denotes
[1:16:54] again he reiterates this
[1:16:56] either war feast day
[1:16:58] or what it means again
[1:17:01] hitting this baseline
[1:17:03] what it means is a gathering together of
[1:17:06] the people
[1:17:08] praise the lord that's what it meant
[1:17:10] trumpet meant gathering together of the
[1:17:12] people
[1:17:13] whether it was for war
[1:17:15] whether it's for feast whether it's for
[1:17:18] jubilee
[1:17:19] what whatever the purpose of it was it
[1:17:21] was it was a gathering together of the
[1:17:24] people right amen now the shout the
[1:17:26] voice brings us all to that place but
[1:17:30] we're not together yet are we right
[1:17:32] we're under that one auspice
[1:17:34] under that one umbrella but you're still
[1:17:37] got bride over on the other side of the
[1:17:40] world right people i still don't know
[1:17:43] right but the trumpet is going to bring
[1:17:44] us all together yes amen amen we'll
[1:17:48] speed up
[1:17:49] they'll slow down
[1:17:50] we'll reach that shore together saints
[1:17:53] amen we'll go to meet the lord in the
[1:17:55] air
[1:17:56] amen well what's the air
[1:17:58] that's the air
[1:18:01] i was just in the air
[1:18:04] this is air right here
[1:18:06] people think the only air that exists is
[1:18:08] a thousand miles up there right that's
[1:18:10] not the only air that exists
[1:18:12] this right here is air too where we're
[1:18:14] going to go meet him in the air well hey
[1:18:16] lord
[1:18:17] that's air
[1:18:19] so
[1:18:20] people make some things more complicated
[1:18:22] than they really need to be but yes we
[1:18:24] go to meet the lord in the air yes amen
[1:18:28] it's a gathering gathering of people
[1:18:30] paul said when the trumpet gives an
[1:18:32] uncertain sound again get back to that
[1:18:34] who can prepare themselves for war for
[1:18:37] peace whatever it is
[1:18:39] who knows
[1:18:40] you have to know what the trumpet sounds
[1:18:44] and i want to get to another particular
[1:18:45] point here before we before i finish
[1:18:47] this out
[1:18:49] you have to know what the trumpet sounds
[1:18:53] therefore when the trumpet sounds we see
[1:18:55] something in the earth today
[1:18:57] there is a great trouble somewhere we
[1:18:59] know that
[1:19:00] and this was 1964 so how much greater
[1:19:03] has it gotten since then
[1:19:05] we know there is everybody uh everybody
[1:19:08] has come a
[1:19:09] neurotic the whole world is a neurotical
[1:19:12] world and isn't that the truth yeah and
[1:19:14] we know there is something wrong the
[1:19:16] pentagon everywhere we know there is
[1:19:18] something wrong
[1:19:20] now the only way listen now the only way
[1:19:23] you'll know what the trumpet sound is
[1:19:26] is to look what the sheet music says
[1:19:29] what's the sheet music
[1:19:34] only way you're going to know what the
[1:19:35] trumpet sound is is to look and know
[1:19:37] what the sheet music is yes amen
[1:19:40] you got to know what the
[1:19:42] music is to know what the sound is or
[1:19:45] how to sound
[1:19:48] he said that's all it's a great symphony
[1:19:50] see beating out like peter and the wolf
[1:19:54] see though that sure dates it doesn't it
[1:19:55] peter in the wall see when you see
[1:19:58] uh the composer has wrote the book the
[1:20:01] composer has wrote the book
[1:20:03] and the director
[1:20:05] now the director must be in the same
[1:20:07] spirit as the composer amen
[1:20:10] speaking of himself of those that uh
[1:20:14] preach the word or
[1:20:15] amen propagate the word that if you
[1:20:18] propagate the word you you must be in
[1:20:20] the same spirit as the composer
[1:20:22] you must read the you must read the
[1:20:25] sheet music in the same spirit that the
[1:20:27] director wrote that the composer wrote
[1:20:29] it in
[1:20:30] and the
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:40] people walk out in the heartbeat we
[1:20:42] listen to that and
[1:20:44] pay a hundred dollars to come listen to
[1:20:45] a bunch of squealing and squawking who
[1:20:46] would do that
[1:20:48] but when you get it all working in fine
[1:20:50] harmony and perfectly together and this
[1:20:52] one does his partners and does this part
[1:20:54] and all this and then the director is in
[1:20:56] the same spirit as the composer and that
[1:20:58] music comes forth my it's a beautiful
[1:21:01] sound yeah have you only gone to a
[1:21:03] symphony before orchestra music a lot of
[1:21:05] people don't like it i love it i don't
[1:21:07] i'd say i love it but i like it i do i
[1:21:10] like listen all the instruments come
[1:21:12] together used to be a band for several
[1:21:14] years so when i listen to that i think
[1:21:16] oh that's so beautiful you see how they
[1:21:18] play and they're so
[1:21:20] uh it's it's it's beautiful even
[1:21:22] watching the poke kids play when you see
[1:21:24] how how they
[1:21:26] they play their instruments and how they
[1:21:28] and you know they have commanded that
[1:21:30] instrument and they play it and when
[1:21:32] they bring that ball across that string
[1:21:34] man it's beautiful amen amen because
[1:21:36] they know what they're doing yes amen
[1:21:39] they've gotten into the spirit of the
[1:21:41] composer
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:44] the director
[1:21:45] the minister must be in the spirit of
[1:21:48] the composer if he doesn't he gives the
[1:21:50] wrong beat and the whole thing is out
[1:21:53] that's what's the matter today we've got
[1:21:55] too many directors it's not in the
[1:21:57] spirit of the composer right now yes
[1:22:00] then i'll say amen
[1:22:02] amen i have to be one of the directors
[1:22:04] but by the grace of god i try to stay in
[1:22:06] the spirit of the composer
[1:22:08] but the band said too many directors
[1:22:09] that are not in the spirit of the
[1:22:10] composer amen oh that's why we get this
[1:22:14] brother branham is god and all this
[1:22:15] stuff that's where all that comes from
[1:22:17] right amen all those doctrines and
[1:22:19] things that's that's what they all come
[1:22:21] from right
[1:22:22] you gotta directors self-composed
[1:22:24] directors that are out of the spirit of
[1:22:25] composer amen this is this when they
[1:22:28] draw this can't take it all through the
[1:22:30] bible
[1:22:32] you just pull a quote out here or a
[1:22:33] scripture out here but it won't match
[1:22:36] letter to letter word the word scripture
[1:22:38] scripture it won't match it was like i
[1:22:40] was saying before if you try to take a
[1:22:42] hard line and out of the breach message
[1:22:44] what are you going to do over here in 65
[1:22:46] when he says something that would sound
[1:22:47] contrary right
[1:22:49] what are you going to do with it
[1:22:51] i told you before i had that brother in
[1:22:52] florida but he used to do that pray
[1:22:54] about it pray about a prayer about it i
[1:22:56] said brother the more i pray about it
[1:22:57] the father i'm getting from where you
[1:22:59] are the more the lord is revealing to me
[1:23:02] the less i can see where you're at
[1:23:04] you're a dark spot right now you're so
[1:23:07] far away from me
[1:23:08] you tell me to keep praying about it
[1:23:10] it's getting me further from you right i
[1:23:12] said you know what he said well what
[1:23:13] about this and then i said well what
[1:23:15] about this
[1:23:16] because in my prayer and study the lord
[1:23:18] would show me this right and i said what
[1:23:20] about this
[1:23:21] i can show you where the lord backs this
[1:23:23] up can you show me where it backs this
[1:23:25] up right yeah what are the quotes do you
[1:23:27] have what other scripture do you have
[1:23:30] does this follow a scriptural pattern or
[1:23:33] a scriptural precedent and it doesn't
[1:23:37] and if it doesn't friend there's
[1:23:39] something wrong somewhere yes because if
[1:23:41] god done it one way one time one way
[1:23:43] he's gonna do it that way all the way
[1:23:44] through there's gonna be the scriptural
[1:23:46] precedent and pattern that god follows
[1:23:49] and if somebody says well
[1:23:51] this has got to happen brother branham's
[1:23:53] got a private resurrection coming and
[1:23:55] he's going to follow over the country i
[1:23:57] said show it to me
[1:23:59] where's the scriptural precedent do i
[1:24:02] believe he's coming back with my dad and
[1:24:04] my son and my mom and my family yes yes
[1:24:07] i do
[1:24:08] what he's going to do in that 30 days i
[1:24:10] have no idea
[1:24:12] brother green's gone now but he said if
[1:24:14] brother battle needs a plan i'll pry i
[1:24:16] have a credit card i'll charter him
[1:24:18] apply private jet and i'll take him
[1:24:20] wherever he wants to go
[1:24:23] he said by the time the bill comes due
[1:24:25] i'll be gone
[1:24:27] all right nemo 30 days right so when the
[1:24:30] bill's due i'll be gone
[1:24:32] but i'll find anywhere he wants to go
[1:24:35] if that's what happens
[1:24:36] i don't believe that but
[1:24:38] you know it's just a little knock on the
[1:24:41] the ideals and not i'm not trying to
[1:24:44] belittle others beliefs but uh there
[1:24:46] just comes a time where it says
[1:24:49] really
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:52] you have you have to
[1:24:54] you can't just say this is going to be
[1:24:56] this you've got to show it scripturally
[1:24:59] you've got to find the scriptural
[1:25:00] precedent you've got to find the
[1:25:02] patterns in the bible where god has done
[1:25:05] this or or does this right if it doesn't
[1:25:08] exist
[1:25:09] then it it's
[1:25:11] it's highly unlikely it's going to
[1:25:13] happen now because everything that we
[1:25:15] everything that we have refers back to
[1:25:17] this
[1:25:18] amen
[1:25:19] my god in the scripture might have had
[1:25:21] things that he started but that that day
[1:25:24] is in the scripture everything we do
[1:25:26] falls back to this
[1:25:27] this is our pattern this is our
[1:25:29] blueprint
[1:25:30] it says put a wall there you put a wall
[1:25:32] there not over there right if it says
[1:25:34] make the wall three foot high you make
[1:25:36] it three foot high not ten foot high
[1:25:38] you gotta follow the blueprint
[1:25:40] amen if that's what he said that's what
[1:25:42] we do
[1:25:44] and that's where so many times directors
[1:25:47] get out of the spirit of the composer
[1:25:51] they say this denomination well this no
[1:25:53] matter what you say the bible is right
[1:25:57] beat it out according to the sheet music
[1:26:00] beat it out according to this
[1:26:03] direct it
[1:26:05] let each instrument blow this particular
[1:26:07] time note play space amen according to
[1:26:11] this
[1:26:12] sheet music am i amen not not not a
[1:26:15] pastor
[1:26:16] not not a pope not a
[1:26:18] prophet not a
[1:26:20] denomination right but according to this
[1:26:23] this is our pattern
[1:26:26] always our pattern it doesn't follow
[1:26:28] this it is wrong
[1:26:31] that's right
[1:26:33] then the great symphony of god great act
[1:26:35] is playing out just right then we see
[1:26:37] the hour that we are lit that we are
[1:26:39] standing now notice the trumpet is to
[1:26:41] call together the people assemble
[1:26:43] themselves together for something now we
[1:26:47] know what our something is
[1:26:49] amen i hope this camera
[1:26:51] keeps working because i forgot to turn
[1:26:53] my phone off um
[1:26:55] but
[1:26:56] we know what our something is
[1:26:59] we know that we are gathering together
[1:27:02] this trump is going to gather us
[1:27:04] together to meet the lord in the air for
[1:27:06] the wedding of letting suffer the lamb
[1:27:08] we know what our something is
[1:27:10] that's what our gathering is for yeah
[1:27:13] praise the lord
[1:27:15] and a new body
[1:27:16] yes no corruption
[1:27:19] my sometimes it announced an important
[1:27:21] person he said like joseph the sounding
[1:27:23] of the trumpet joseph appeared which is
[1:27:25] a symbol of the great trumpet we speak
[1:27:27] of he's talking about after a while
[1:27:30] he said now when the grave trumpet
[1:27:31] sounds when that ensign will be lifted
[1:27:34] up
[1:27:35] there'll there'll come a time when the
[1:27:37] great trumpet will be signed and all
[1:27:39] nations will gather to it to jerusalem
[1:27:41] that's when the millennium starts the
[1:27:43] great trumpet well when is that
[1:27:46] that is after the atonement
[1:27:49] oh
[1:27:50] you could get into
[1:27:52] and we could so easily go back into the
[1:27:55] feast
[1:27:56] and find where brother branham found
[1:27:57] that after that time that after that
[1:28:01] feast after that seventh feast
[1:28:03] that seventh church age the sevens that
[1:28:06] brother adam the threes five sevens the
[1:28:08] scriptural uh numerics in the scripture
[1:28:11] so what do you do with that seventh now
[1:28:13] it's run out but now you've got because
[1:28:15] remember the seventh age runs in through
[1:28:18] the millennium
[1:28:20] you realize that right
[1:28:22] people always say well and we have songs
[1:28:25] we sing it we read in the scripture and
[1:28:27] time is no more people think time cease
[1:28:29] to exist when the bride leaves no it
[1:28:31] doesn't right you got a tribulation
[1:28:33] going on you got armageddon that goes on
[1:28:35] right
[1:28:36] you've got god revealing himself to the
[1:28:38] jews uh you got the millennium you got
[1:28:41] gog and magog and then the white throne
[1:28:43] judgment right
[1:28:44] amen time runs through all that even
[1:28:48] through the millennium right there'll be
[1:28:50] time right and we had that discussion
[1:28:52] yesterday i think i actually may have
[1:28:54] brought a quote up about it
[1:28:56] and uh
[1:28:58] now if we did it's going to be in here
[1:29:00] somewhere
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:06] well i don't know if i printed it or
[1:29:08] not uh i had some quotes pulled up
[1:29:12] and my computer
[1:29:13] conked out on me so i had to start all
[1:29:15] over again so i may have forgotten to
[1:29:16] put that one in there but the discussion
[1:29:18] we had was about you know
[1:29:20] we're gonna our brother pat i think said
[1:29:22] are we gonna build our own houses when
[1:29:23] we get there it's like well it's been
[1:29:25] somewhere you're talking about it's the
[1:29:26] millennium according to scripture
[1:29:28] brother brown yes new city no it's
[1:29:31] already all prepared for us right amen
[1:29:34] so
[1:29:35] so the time period of the millennium is
[1:29:39] is a different period it's that thousand
[1:29:41] years that we'll spend with the lord
[1:29:42] whether nobody dies
[1:29:44] breaking the curse of the original sin
[1:29:47] right in the garden of eden no man's
[1:29:48] lived a thousand years or one day with
[1:29:50] god since uh the sin the god of eden
[1:29:53] nobody
[1:29:54] but it will be
[1:29:56] and we all will be in the millennium
[1:29:58] together yes praise the lord and i found
[1:30:00] a quote that was along those lines where
[1:30:02] brother branham said that which
[1:30:03] refreshed my memory that brother brown
[1:30:06] did say that he talked about yeah in the
[1:30:07] millennium they'll be building
[1:30:09] houses and eating the fruit of the
[1:30:11] vineyards and things like that and
[1:30:13] i know when brother lionel read that he
[1:30:15] was real excited because he's a
[1:30:16] carpenter so
[1:30:18] building houses well praise the lord
[1:30:19] that was right up his alley
[1:30:22] but um but anyway so
[1:30:25] uh here i wanted to get to this quote
[1:30:28] so the
[1:30:30] we finished off with the with the with
[1:30:32] the idea the thought that
[1:30:34] um
[1:30:36] that you you have to be in the spirit of
[1:30:38] the composer
[1:30:40] the director should be in the spirit of
[1:30:42] the composer
[1:30:44] the people the the instruments should be
[1:30:47] in the spirit of the composer the
[1:30:48] director
[1:30:49] and when they're all working together in
[1:30:51] harmony in unison
[1:30:53] it makes beautiful music right
[1:30:56] but if i were to go up there
[1:30:58] and i were to try to play a clarinet
[1:31:01] like my wife tried to do in high school
[1:31:03] or read the sheet music of
[1:31:06] of a trumpet or even a guitar piano
[1:31:09] uh
[1:31:10] i played the drums boom boom boom boom
[1:31:12] that's that's what i knew
[1:31:15] i could read music a little bit every
[1:31:16] little boy does every good boy does fine
[1:31:18] face but anyway i could read music but
[1:31:21] to to try to get it behind and to play
[1:31:24] something
[1:31:25] i would be completely lost see it was
[1:31:27] only for that person
[1:31:30] the composer wrote it for everybody to
[1:31:33] be included
[1:31:34] but i could go and i could play the
[1:31:36] drums to that music but i couldn't even
[1:31:38] begin to think about playing guitar or
[1:31:40] piano or trumpet or something to that
[1:31:42] music i'd have no clue right you see so
[1:31:45] each one was made for each person
[1:31:48] for them to understand right now how are
[1:31:51] we gonna know how does
[1:31:53] the bride know
[1:31:55] because it's not for everybody
[1:31:57] this rapture is not for everybody it's
[1:32:00] only for
[1:32:01] a small selected alive and remain group
[1:32:04] that's still here now of course it's for
[1:32:06] those that resurrect two but we're just
[1:32:08] talking about the live and remain group
[1:32:09] see he says here now he said why didn't
[1:32:12] this feast of the trumpets again still
[1:32:15] why didn't they get it why didn't the
[1:32:17] jews understand
[1:32:18] why didn't the jews get it they were
[1:32:20] righteous men listen now they were
[1:32:22] righteous men they were good men they
[1:32:25] were holy men there were all kinds of
[1:32:28] people but to whom it is predestinated
[1:32:32] to hear the word right it's only to
[1:32:35] those who are predestinated to hear the
[1:32:38] word amen now if a clarinetist or a
[1:32:40] flutist or something was in an orchestra
[1:32:42] that person was hand-picked maybe out of
[1:32:45] 200 different flutists flautas flutists
[1:32:50] clarinettis their knives i don't know
[1:32:54] out of
[1:32:55] 200 they picked one
[1:32:57] maybe two
[1:32:59] maybe three
[1:33:00] but out of 200 a few were selected
[1:33:03] to do that to play that part it's not
[1:33:05] for everybody
[1:33:06] it was only for the predestined right
[1:33:09] for those to hear the word it was only
[1:33:10] for the predestination
[1:33:12] for those to listen to the trumpet of
[1:33:15] freedom when it sounded
[1:33:17] and you heard that voice of freedom that
[1:33:19] loosed you from the binds of the the
[1:33:22] bonds of satan and it loosed you it was
[1:33:24] only for the predestination yes amen now
[1:33:28] the the invitation
[1:33:30] was free for all
[1:33:32] understand the invitation went out to
[1:33:34] everybody amen but only those that chose
[1:33:37] and
[1:33:38] and and decided to go that were the
[1:33:41] predestined that god knew before the
[1:33:44] foundation of the world
[1:33:45] to whom it is predestined to hear the
[1:33:48] word
[1:33:49] well to whom it is predestined they'll
[1:33:51] be the ones to hear that trumpet
[1:33:53] amen when the trumpet of god sounds
[1:33:56] it'll be the predestined that hears it
[1:33:58] not everybody's going to know it it's a
[1:34:00] secret
[1:34:01] the bride is a secret going away the
[1:34:04] world won't know about it there'll be
[1:34:05] some people left behind that'll know
[1:34:07] because they were privy to certain
[1:34:08] information but they're not going to
[1:34:10] know
[1:34:11] there'll be certain people to say well
[1:34:12] where did john go
[1:34:14] well i knew john duncan yeah
[1:34:17] he was
[1:34:18] you know lived here and painted and did
[1:34:21] all this and i hadn't seen him a while
[1:34:23] anybody seen him oh no he's gone i don't
[1:34:25] know what happened
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:28] and people know so well
[1:34:30] i noticed so-and-so is gone too
[1:34:33] well you know i haven't seen so-and-so
[1:34:34] in a while either reckon it could have
[1:34:36] happened already
[1:34:38] and it will have yes
[1:34:40] it will have happened yes
[1:34:44] it's a promise
[1:34:47] predestinated here the word how do you
[1:34:49] know whether it is the word how do you
[1:34:51] know whether it's the word each one says
[1:34:52] this that and the other is the promise
[1:34:55] of the bible being vindicated of that
[1:34:57] age
[1:34:58] there you are then you come back to
[1:35:00] where the holy spirit is
[1:35:03] it's the word of god
[1:35:05] vindicated that was predicted
[1:35:06] scripturally vindicated at that in that
[1:35:09] age at that time with those people there
[1:35:11] you are
[1:35:12] that's where this whole that brother
[1:35:14] ramen says that's where you come back
[1:35:15] that's where the holy spirit is
[1:35:18] watch the sound of a trumpet in a few
[1:35:19] minutes it declares the trumpet the
[1:35:21] gospel trumpet see who can hear it who
[1:35:24] can hear it remember those in the walled
[1:35:26] cities could not come out in the jubilee
[1:35:29] no sir they were in the walls and other
[1:35:32] parts that you believe wanted to talk
[1:35:34] about but anyway
[1:35:36] in that walls they could not see it they
[1:35:38] could not come out no sir they were in
[1:35:41] the walls they had to stay there
[1:35:44] it was over they were slaves the rest of
[1:35:46] their life because they had been marked
[1:35:50] slaves the rest of their lives they
[1:35:52] could not hear it they could not
[1:35:54] participate they weren't a part of it
[1:35:57] it's for the predestination
[1:35:59] those that god has selected and
[1:36:01] pre-chosen amen
[1:36:04] to hear that trump that trump of god
[1:36:06] that sounds out
[1:36:07] amen
[1:36:09] the trump of god the voice of god
[1:36:12] revelation chapter one
[1:36:14] i'll read this i got one more quote i
[1:36:16] want to finish with
[1:36:18] revelation chapter one verse
[1:36:20] uh we'll start with verse nine i john
[1:36:23] who also am your brother and command a
[1:36:26] companion in tribulation and in the
[1:36:28] kingdom and patience of jesus christ was
[1:36:31] in the owl that is called patmos for the
[1:36:33] word of god and for the testimony of
[1:36:35] jesus christ
[1:36:36] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:36:39] and heard behind me a great voice
[1:36:42] as of a trumpet
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:46] what trumpet is that it's the trump of
[1:36:48] god
[1:36:50] amen that is the trump of god yes person
[1:36:54] i go by sometimes up here on aina and i
[1:36:56] see that beautiful mormon lds temple
[1:37:00] they got set up there and some and i
[1:37:03] tell you what friend those are some
[1:37:04] diligent people because that guy up
[1:37:06] there blowing that trumpet stays as
[1:37:08] crisp and clean and
[1:37:09] and shiny as you'd want any element to
[1:37:12] be shined and it's not easy to get to
[1:37:14] every time i every time i go by it that
[1:37:16] thing is shining and it probably to have
[1:37:20] a heart a speck of dust on it somebody
[1:37:21] probably cleans it every week
[1:37:23] but he's standing there blowing the
[1:37:25] trumpet
[1:37:26] supposed to be gabriel maybe michael i
[1:37:28] don't know this is the trump of god
[1:37:30] friend
[1:37:31] when the trump of god blows it's god's
[1:37:33] speaking right just like he did in in
[1:37:37] with moses
[1:37:38] amen when he spoke it trumpeted
[1:37:41] when they listened to that voice it
[1:37:43] trumpeted it when john heard that voice
[1:37:45] speak
[1:37:46] it was like a trumpet
[1:37:48] saying i am alpha omega the first and
[1:37:50] the last
[1:37:51] and what thou see is write in the book
[1:37:53] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:37:55] where asia ephesus merdian pergamos ty
[1:37:58] tyra sardis philadelphia laodicea but

[1:38:18] it
[1:38:20] that's just happens
[1:38:21] sometimes
[1:38:24] sometimes you hear old people say
[1:38:27] the the best lessons in life are what
[1:38:30] learned
[1:38:32] learned lessons are the best lessons in
[1:38:34] life we'll learn it when it happens

[1:47:40] santa claus a couple edges down
[1:47:42] most i got it most
[1:47:44] uh
[1:47:46] pulled out there i'm not sure i still
[1:47:48] have to go get the paint and stuff for
[1:47:49] it i don't have the paint or the i don't
[1:47:51] even have any brushes or rollers or
[1:47:53] anything yet so i have to get those
[1:47:55] together
[1:47:56] but
[1:47:57] okay
[1:47:59] so it shouldn't take too long
[1:48:01] of
[1:48:03] cutting in is kind of the more
[1:48:04] time-consuming part my brother john yeah
[1:48:07] yeah
[1:48:08] and uh and then the rest and get a
[1:48:10] couple cutters couple rollers we'll get
[1:48:12] it done but even if it's just me and
[1:48:14] micah we'll get it we'll get it it won't
[1:48:16] it shouldn't be
[1:48:17] too bad
[1:48:19] did you have a question system
[1:48:24] so if you want to lord willing then the
[1:48:25] next time we come back in service it
[1:48:27] will be a different color
[1:48:28] it won't be hugely different it'll be
[1:48:31] the grayish type color is what we picked
[1:48:33] kind of that matches the carpet a little
[1:48:34] bit more
[1:48:36] amen but lord william i'm going to try
[1:48:38] to do that tomorrow brother rogers
[1:48:39] extended his stay in
[1:48:41] in jeffersonville to the end of the week
[1:48:43] because of steve's passing and he's
[1:48:45] supposed to he was asked to officiate
[1:48:47] the funeral so
[1:48:49] he'll be gone
[1:48:51] probably at least till thursday
[1:48:54] so
[1:48:55] probably do again
[1:48:57] uh this monday i haven't heard from
[1:48:59] craig yet about the
[1:49:00] facility for our dinner but we're still
[1:49:02] working on it the refrigerator is
[1:49:04] supposed to be here friday uh i've
[1:49:07] noticed there the cleaning crew and all
[1:49:09] was in over here today cleaning out this
[1:49:11] place next door so
[1:49:13] we'll
[1:49:14] we'll let you know about that when that
[1:49:16] time comes but it's likely going to be
[1:49:18] the 5th or 12th not sure yet but
[1:49:20] december
[1:49:21] and that will do it so
[1:49:24] amen
[1:49:26] it seems like i had another thing to say
[1:49:27] but i can't remember
[1:49:30] yeah what about tuesday i have a
[1:49:31] doctor's appointment at 1 15. uh you're
[1:49:34] going to be here tuesday
[1:49:36] probably not i promise joel my tuesday
[1:49:40] what's that again i promised joel my
[1:49:43] tutor
[1:49:46] okay yeah
[1:49:48] they
[1:49:48] wanted to get together too and then
[1:49:50] wednesday
[1:49:51] which i hear the service but
[1:49:54] you said there's no no service wednesday
[1:49:56] right thank you no service this
[1:49:58] wednesday
[1:49:59] or the following wednesday this
[1:50:01] wednesday of course the paint i made if
[1:50:03] i need to come back and paint wednesday
[1:50:04] i may be here with painting wednesday
[1:50:06] too some uh i want to get rid of these
[1:50:09] chords too so i'm going to fix all this
[1:50:11] to where the chords go away
[1:50:13] um so i still have some work in here to
[1:50:15] do
[1:50:16] uh
[1:50:16] but wednesday yes wednesday that's that
[1:50:19] was the thing i was want to say
[1:50:21] wednesday service is canceled in lieu of
[1:50:24] the paint fumes the next wednesday's
[1:50:26] canceled because the thursday following
[1:50:28] is thanksgiving
[1:50:30] so the next two wednesdays are canceled
[1:50:32] we'll
[1:50:33] our wednesday reconvening wednesday will
[1:50:35] be december 1st amen so thank you that's
[1:50:39] uh that's the one thing i wanted to
[1:50:41] remember to say again
[1:50:43] yes thank you
[1:50:45] amen
[1:50:46] praise the lord god bless you we did uh
[1:50:49] i'd
[1:50:50] probably do it when we have more
[1:50:51] brothers but
[1:50:52] there's three sisters it's it's very
[1:50:55] unusual for brothers to outnumber
[1:50:56] sisters in a message church but
[1:50:59] i looked i thought well we got a
[1:51:01] trifecta of sisters here the rest are
[1:51:03] all brothers now
[1:51:05] but we enjoyed the breakfast yesterday
[1:51:07] so we talked about doing that maybe once
[1:51:09] a month
[1:51:11] a breakfast one
[1:51:12] on a saturday morning once a month
[1:51:15] doing that so
[1:51:17] i hear i see a lot of
[1:51:18] nodding so maybe we'll do that then you
[1:51:21] can come you can can't you know we'll
[1:51:23] try to switch it up and go different
[1:51:25] places maybe
[1:51:27] um
[1:51:28] see what the lord does with that i
[1:51:29] enjoyed the fellowship so yeah it was a
[1:51:31] real blessing you can't beat that 6.99
[1:51:34] breakfast though yeah
[1:51:37] true
[1:51:38] maybe in taste not in price
[1:51:43] john's disagreeing with me too no
[1:51:47] my wife likes it i know that
[1:51:48] amen
[1:51:50] praise the lord so we'll think on that
[1:51:51] and and uh if y'all want to text me or
[1:51:54] throw a date
[1:51:55] uh that you like the next time then
[1:51:57] we'll look to that and see what we could
[1:51:58] do
[1:52:00] but i like that idea so
[1:52:02] lord richly bless you today anything
[1:52:04] else
[1:52:06] before dismissed
[1:52:08] patricia wanted it said that
[1:52:11] she
[1:52:12] does not have goldman
[1:52:14] amen
[1:52:23] if it entered in anybody's mind since
[1:52:25] brother pat said that
[1:52:26] uh neither does julie and her sister
[1:52:29] they don't have it of course julie
[1:52:31] she has natural immunity because she had
[1:52:33] it previously which is even stronger
[1:52:35] than the shot plus she got the shot so
[1:52:37] that's true um
[1:52:39] but her sister actually got tested and
[1:52:42] she is negative
[1:52:47] is educated
[1:52:49] on the
[1:52:50] csi effect and she says
[1:52:54] i know that the tests don't always come
[1:52:56] out correct
[1:52:59] so
[1:53:00] true
[1:53:02] true
[1:53:03] we've seen that with joel
[1:53:06] you just came back positive you never
[1:53:08] had code none of us got it but anyway
[1:53:11] yeah that's true
[1:53:13] great truth i i wanted to say you know
[1:53:16] the lord i think the lord just gave me a
[1:53:18] revelation but you inspired the lord to
[1:53:21] give me the revelation
[1:53:23] and picking them when your name is
[1:53:25] called
[1:53:27] you know
[1:53:30] i i didn't come up on my own i believe
[1:53:32] the lord just said that
[1:53:34] you know your name
[1:53:36] is your name
[1:53:38] in any language
[1:53:41] you're john in english
[1:53:43] you're still john in french
[1:53:46] you're john you know if you say you call
[1:53:48] me this then that's what your name is
[1:53:50] yeah
[1:53:53] amen
[1:53:54] no matter what language you speak yeah
[1:53:56] the lord don't call your name no matter
[1:53:59] what language you're speaking it's going
[1:54:00] to be your name amen
[1:54:02] yes
[1:54:04] yeah just not sure if i'm going to be
[1:54:05] identified as newton on the other side i
[1:54:08] think he's got me a new name
[1:54:11] but we'll know it either way he says
[1:54:13] either way because it's a call in the
[1:54:15] heart not the year right amen it's funny
[1:54:17] because i'm sorry to keep you i when i
[1:54:20] was driving uber i was down and
