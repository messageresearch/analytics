[29:37] focus he should always be our number one
[29:39] reason
[29:40] purpose everything about it amen in our
[29:43] whole lives is about him
[29:45] you know the bible says we put him first
[29:48] that everything else in life will be
[29:50] added too
[29:50] yes amen everything else takes care of
[29:52] itself we put him first
[29:55] you know it seems like we try to work at
[29:56] that backwards so many times
[29:58] we try to fix all the stuff and and we
[30:01] leave jesus out of it sometimes
[30:03] but you know if we just put him first
[30:05] he'll take care of all the rest
[30:08] not that we don't believe not that we
[30:09] don't have faith or not that we don't
[30:11] have a part to do
[30:12] because we do right but through us the
[30:14] lord will work with all of us
[30:16] amen it'll be just a miracle you see
[30:19] amazing how
[30:20] god puts all those things just in place
[30:23] amen brings healing and blessing and
[30:26] answers questions and heals the
[30:28] depressed and
[30:29] all the things that lord does just put
[30:32] him first you're right
[30:33] amen praise the lord i appreciate what
[30:35] micah said and
[30:36] and it is true and and i just i like uh
[30:40] i believe in penny roses on uh
[30:44] people now right and i very much do
[30:47] appreciate
[30:48] uh what uh what him and uh brother zach
[30:52] do and
[30:53] their efforts here and and it's just
[30:55] like me standing here before you today
[30:57] it's all him right as none of us can
[31:00] acclaim to anything
[31:01] it's all about him and it's all him he's
[31:03] the one who does it all
[31:04] but he does look for willing subjects
[31:06] very amen he does look for those who are
[31:08] willing to do it
[31:10] amen i just uh i'm just thankful that
[31:13] the lord
[31:13] that i'm a willing subject i thank god
[31:15] that we're willing subjects of his
[31:18] and whatever he wants us to do uh
[31:20] whatever he's called us to whatever
[31:22] purpose he's put before us
[31:23] right we're willing to do it amen amen
[31:26] willing to do whatever his perfect will
[31:28] would be for us in life
[31:29] amen so god bless you so thankful to be
[31:32] here today
[31:33] and welcome to the house of the lord
[31:35] welcome you if you're streaming today
[31:36] i know we have a few people out
[31:38] different sicknesses and things going on
[31:41] sister lydia's not here her daughter and
[31:43] uh
[31:44] them are moving today so she's taking
[31:46] care of the children and sister shelia
[31:47] and of course she got the
[31:49] prayer requests with sister shariah in
[31:50] her back and
[31:52] um and of course tabitha and brother
[31:54] dennis and
[31:56] but the lord is here right and that's
[31:58] what matters the most amen
[32:00] it's funny because um you know
[32:04] zach mentioned and quoted the scripture
[32:06] where two or three are gathered in his
[32:07] name there he is in the midst
[32:09] you hardly ever hear that quoted when
[32:11] there's 500 people in attendance
[32:14] or when there's even 50 or 100 you
[32:16] hardly ever hear anybody say that
[32:18] but when it's uh even when we have a
[32:20] full house you already ever hear but
[32:22] it's true either way
[32:23] amen because you can have a whole room
[32:25] full of people and only two or three
[32:27] that are there in his name right
[32:29] amen amen that's the truth praise the
[32:31] lord not necessarily here but just
[32:33] you know places churches say they're of
[32:36] the lord you know they you come in the
[32:38] name of the lord
[32:39] that's the whole point amen people come
[32:41] to church all the time
[32:42] but he said if you come in my name amen
[32:45] not the name of the denomination
[32:47] not in the name of a message not the
[32:49] name of a prophet
[32:51] but in jesus name amen amen
[32:54] praise the lord that's that's what
[32:55] changes it all amen praise the lord now
[32:58] uh sister kathy uh wanted us to
[33:02] have prayer for her she wanted us to lay
[33:04] hands on her
[33:05] and uh anoint her with all so i'm gonna
[33:07] ask her to go ahead and come up now if
[33:08] she would
[33:11] amen the lord woke me up this morning
[33:14] and reminded me sister norma to
[33:16] put this in my bible because we seldom
[33:18] do this anymore but
[33:20] i do have the anointing oil and she
[33:23] wanted to specifically ask that we do
[33:25] that so i'm thankful the lord reminded
[33:26] me to put it in my bible this morning so
[33:29] amen so we'll remember
[33:33] sister kathy's just needing a touch from
[33:34] the lord and moved upon her of course
[33:36] you heard her request for a daughter
[33:38] amen so you have a a
[33:43] faithful witness it meant for her today
[33:45] so we're going to pray together
[33:47] for a minute as her mother of course
[33:49] lays hands forward too
[33:50] lord jesus father we're here today
[33:53] calling on the precious name of jesus
[33:55] once again
[33:56] for our precious sister lord who is as
[33:59] you know the lord has rededicated her
[34:01] life and given her life into your hands
[34:03] and trusting you for leadership guidance
[34:05] and direction
[34:06] and lord she's coming up father desiring
[34:08] to fulfill the scripture lord that
[34:11] if we anoint those with oil and lay
[34:13] hands on them
[34:15] that they will recover lord and god that
[34:18] recovery is can mean so many things
[34:20] depending on the situation of life so
[34:22] many times we think it's sickness in
[34:24] body and certainly our sister needs a
[34:26] touch from you and her body lord
[34:28] but so many things in our lives god that
[34:30] we need to touch from you for lord and
[34:32] she's asking for that right now she's
[34:34] believing in prayer god
[34:36] and as your hand or mother has hands
[34:38] later as i do as we stand here
[34:41] abiding by your word lord and binding
[34:44] our faith together
[34:45] that lord you would move upon her life
[34:47] even now father
[34:49] deliver her strengthen her bless her
[34:51] lead her guide her
[34:52] help her in every way god that your
[34:54] perfect will would be manifested in her
[34:56] life
[34:57] may your holy spirit show itself real to
[35:00] her
[35:00] lord that she would know the direction
[35:02] that you would have her to go
[35:04] lord bless your family bless your
[35:05] daughter god again i lift her up before
[35:08] you katrina god that you would touch her
[35:10] now
[35:10] lord it's your hand of mercy and beat
[35:12] upon her and her family and
[35:14] lord all that you do for them god we
[35:16] just commit her to you lord now
[35:18] satan you have lost this battle for many
[35:21] years you've tried to take this sister
[35:23] but we rebuke you in the name of jesus
[35:26] christ and you have absolutely
[35:28] no control no authority over her now

[36:13] than honored to do so and
[36:14] and i know as you come before the church

[36:21] of people and

[38:20] for all that is said and done
[38:21] for we do it in the name of the lord our
[38:23] lord and savior jesus christ
[38:25] amen amen amen first thessalonians
[38:29] chapter 4 verse 13.
[38:32] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[38:33] brethren concerning them which are
[38:35] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[38:37] others which have no hope
[38:38] for if we believe that jesus died and
[38:40] rose again even so then which
[38:42] uh also which sleep in jesus will god
[38:45] bring with him
[38:46] for this we say unto you by the word of
[38:48] the lord that we which are alive and
[38:50] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[38:51] not prevent them
[38:52] which are asleep for the lord himself
[38:55] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[38:58] with the voice of the archangel with the
[38:59] trump of god and the dead in christ
[39:01] shall rise first
[39:02] then we which are alive and remain shall
[39:05] be called up together
[39:06] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[39:08] in the air so shall we ever be with the
[39:11] lord
[39:11] wherefore cover one another with these
[39:13] words thank you thank you amen you can
[39:15] be seated if you'd like
[39:18] amen i'm i'm gonna take a little um
[39:22] i'm gonna take a little sidebar today um
[39:27] from last week's message
[39:30] and some resulting uh
[39:34] question and things that came to me
[39:37] during the week and so the message today
[39:41] isn't going to be focused specifically
[39:43] on the rapture
[39:44] uh i know last week that we talked about
[39:47] it and it had been on my heart to
[39:49] bring a different facet of this
[39:52] but uh lord willie will do that next
[39:54] week if lord would terry
[39:56] but i felt inspired and necessary to try
[39:59] to
[40:00] delve into this a little bit deeper
[40:03] i hit the surface of it last week
[40:06] thinking maybe that would be sufficient
[40:09] for for what i would need to say and it
[40:12] it just came to me that it wasn't so i
[40:15] want to take a little bit deeper dive
[40:17] there's probably going to be a lot of
[40:19] things which you know most of us know
[40:21] anyway we're seasoned christians
[40:23] veterans of the lord been in the message
[40:24] most of the time most of us many years
[40:27] many of the things we know but the lord
[40:30] unfolded some things to me that i want
[40:32] to share with you
[40:33] and that i want to just trust it be a
[40:36] blessing to you
[40:37] and it's going to pertain to the rapture
[40:38] because remember last week
[40:40] one of my main focuses was those that
[40:43] are going in the rapture
[40:44] those that are going in this scriptural
[40:47] rapture that we're talking about that we
[40:49] just read about this
[40:50] rapture right here we know there's been
[40:52] other raptures we know there's been
[40:54] other resurrections and we'll get into
[40:56] that later
[40:57] but we know that this one that we read
[40:59] every time that we come for this
[41:01] end of service for this subject is
[41:04] for the bride of jesus christ only
[41:07] now of course we know and i mentioned
[41:09] last week that
[41:11] and before many times i've said this
[41:14] that we know that that bride is not just
[41:16] for this church age
[41:18] it's not just for this uh time period
[41:20] it's for
[41:21] from the very first church age from acts
[41:24] 2
[41:24] on down to today every one of those
[41:27] that live to their message amen
[41:31] maybe you know brother brown said that
[41:33] uh i could have brought that quote but i
[41:35] did but he said that
[41:36] lived to their message that lived to the
[41:38] word for their day for their time
[41:41] for each one of those from from paul and
[41:43] irenaeus and martin and luther and
[41:45] columba and all down to brother branham
[41:48] each one that lived at their message to
[41:50] live
[41:50] that word for their day was considered
[41:54] and and with the holy spirit the bride
[41:56] of jesus christ for that day
[41:58] right amen which is all a part of the
[42:01] mystical body of jesus christ
[42:04] uh each one individually
[42:07] makes up that entirety of the body just
[42:10] like the bride
[42:11] internationally today makes up the
[42:14] entirety of the body
[42:16] now there may be people born there may
[42:18] be people died
[42:19] in the past 50 years 60 years since
[42:21] brother brown's gone
[42:23] that was bright thank god i believe i'm
[42:25] one of those that were born
[42:27] uh that was a part of that there's been
[42:28] many that's gone on but that doesn't
[42:30] change the fact of the body because
[42:33] those that have gone on before
[42:35] and those that are alive and remain are
[42:37] still all a part of this
[42:38] same body amen brother bam talked about
[42:42] from that first church age and how it
[42:44] began
[42:45] how it started and those that followed
[42:47] that message are the ones that
[42:49] that entered in amen we know on the day
[42:51] of pentecost
[42:53] when when peter gave a 15-minute sermon
[42:55] there were 3 000 souls added to the
[42:58] church
[42:58] that day at one time in one sitting
[43:01] three thousand
[43:02] i think well that's a lot it's amazing
[43:05] how sometimes
[43:06] i was thinking of that this morning we
[43:09] had a nice ministers meeting
[43:11] uh yesterday it was really good in
[43:13] phoenix i felt it was
[43:15] of the lord felt the spirit of the lord
[43:16] there thought it was very good
[43:18] um you know there's always you know
[43:21] things maybe you'd do different or
[43:23] change a little bit but it was it was
[43:24] good
[43:25] really was uh but it's amazing how uh
[43:28] especially ministers we
[43:29] we kind of like to throw in there the
[43:31] brother branham said one in a million
[43:33] and you know that is true i believe that
[43:35] brother brown said that
[43:37] brought a whole message one in a million
[43:38] one in a million and we'd like to throw
[43:40] that one in a million until
[43:41] until it comes time for our congregation
[43:43] then you know we won't we want a million
[43:46] in our church but you see it's only one
[43:48] in a million until
[43:49] it comes to the church you think well
[43:51] why aren't there more people well you
[43:52] know it's one in a million right so
[43:54] that's the way it is but we know that
[43:56] down but we know that doubt that one in
[43:58] a million
[43:59] down through the church ages god is
[44:02] called people
[44:03] and and the part i want us to see is
[44:05] that
[44:06] each one that saw the word for their day
[44:09] that lived the word for their day that
[44:12] followed the message that was sent to
[44:14] them
[44:15] they are the ones that become bride they
[44:18] are the ones that are considered
[44:19] bride god filled them with the holy
[44:22] spirit
[44:22] revealed his word to them and they
[44:25] passed on
[44:26] and they will resurrect and we would be
[44:28] changed
[44:29] and go to the lord and go and meet the
[44:32] lord in the air
[44:33] that's our rapture now
[44:38] the point i want to get across the point
[44:40] i want to get to today
[44:42] because because of what i said last week
[44:45] is that i believe
[44:48] that only the people that
[44:52] that are considered bride for this last
[44:54] day will hear this message
[44:56] right they will believe this message
[44:59] and it will be a part of their lives
[45:00] they will be filled with the holy ghost
[45:02] and this message will what will be their
[45:06] portion the word because it's the word
[45:09] that changes
[45:10] right it's the word that uh that brings
[45:13] life because it's christ
[45:15] christ is the word i've told you many
[45:16] times people say the message message
[45:19] message
[45:20] and they say message like it's some kind
[45:22] of a separate entity
[45:23] well friend the message is not a
[45:25] separate entity it's just
[45:27] christ the message has been the message
[45:30] since the first church age it's been the
[45:33] message
[45:34] no doubt now brother branham had a
[45:36] different calling and a different
[45:37] placement in that body
[45:39] to bring something to the bride for this
[45:42] last day
[45:44] just like uh uh just like wesley had
[45:47] something for the philadelphia
[45:48] church age just like luther had
[45:51] something for his church age and columba
[45:54] and on down see each one had their
[45:57] message but the message is jesus christ
[46:00] the word
[46:01] amen amen without this word
[46:05] without this there would never have been
[46:08] this amen right
[46:09] without this bible the word there never
[46:12] could be a message
[46:13] because this came from this right so
[46:16] it's all christ
[46:17] and we can't forget that yeah it's we
[46:20] can't
[46:20] people would try to separate it as a
[46:22] separate entity when it's
[46:23] not amen right it is jesus christ see
[46:27] and if that word has come to call a
[46:30] bride
[46:30] out of a church age as he called
[46:33] a a a a a a people out of a people as we
[46:38] read last week moses calling the people
[46:39] out of a people
[46:40] then there's got to be a people that is
[46:43] going to
[46:44] uh hear this word live this word
[46:47] and become this word so based on the
[46:51] fact
[46:51] that and i don't believe i'm far faced
[46:54] in my understanding
[46:56] that the the people that will be in this
[46:59] rapture will live to their message
[47:01] now there's a crossover period from
[47:03] wesley to this church age from
[47:05] philadelphia to laosea there's a change
[47:08] over
[47:09] there was people that were born under
[47:10] philadelphia lived under philadelphia
[47:12] even when brother adam came on the scene
[47:15] if they were a part of that
[47:16] god attributes that to them then that'll
[47:18] be their abortion
[47:20] amen now in this last day now that we
[47:23] have no excuse because it's been going
[47:25] for over a hundred years
[47:26] and and it is still going but it's still
[47:29] christ because he's still the same
[47:30] yesterday today and forever
[47:32] if you believe that and live to that
[47:34] that
[47:35] and fill the holy spirit that's that
[47:38] person
[47:38] that that's what i believe considered to
[47:41] be the pride and again i don't i don't
[47:43] think that's a stretch
[47:44] i really don't because that's the word
[47:45] that's what changes you yeah right
[47:48] amen not a denominational word not the
[47:50] word of some man or pro or
[47:52] a pastor or something but the word of
[47:54] god right
[47:55] the word of god the message of the hour
[47:57] now
[47:58] the only way that we can know christ
[48:02] is by revelation right we know that
[48:04] brother graham says that and
[48:06] uh i believe it's christ the mystery of
[48:07] god revealed we went over that with
[48:09] four five six services that the only way
[48:12] to know jesus
[48:13] is by revelation you can't know him by
[48:15] the letter of this word
[48:17] you can't know him by the letter of this
[48:19] word you can only know him by the
[48:20] revelation of the word
[48:22] as it speaks back to you amen amen
[48:25] by hearing amen so that knowing jesus
[48:29] christ
[48:30] is to know him by the word and
[48:33] there's but by revelation of that word
[48:37] because there's many many parts of this
[48:40] scripture
[48:41] now uh follow me many
[48:44] parts of this scripture because we know
[48:48] the bible was written
[48:50] i'm trying to take my time and not get
[48:52] too far ahead but there's a lot i have a
[48:53] lot of scripture i want to read
[48:55] so if you're watching uh have your
[48:57] bibles closed if you're here
[48:58] have your bibles close i have several
[49:00] scriptures i want to read but i don't
[49:02] want to rush this
[49:03] amen so we know that the bible was
[49:06] written by men filled with the holy
[49:08] ghost
[49:09] inspired by the holy ghost amen
[49:13] inspired by god they were men led of god
[49:16] to
[49:16] write what's in this bible yeah we know
[49:18] that
[49:20] that being so we know that there's
[49:24] many many parts of this scripture
[49:27] that were purposely written so they
[49:30] could not be figured out
[49:34] there's many many parts of the
[49:36] description now there's some parts of it
[49:38] you can read and you can put a
[49:40] together with b and 2 and 2 is 4 and you
[49:43] can add it all up and you can say this
[49:45] equals this this but there's many parts
[49:47] of scripture this is where a lot of
[49:48] people get off
[49:49] right and a lot of i'm sorry but a lot
[49:52] of churches and christians
[49:53] just don't believe that you have to have
[49:56] a revelation
[49:57] to gain uh an understanding of the
[49:59] scripture right
[50:01] they just think that you can read it uh
[50:05] and gain knowledge from it and say well
[50:07] the bible says this
[50:08] yes it does say that but what about the
[50:11] revelation of what the word is saying to
[50:13] you
[50:14] amen amen i'm gonna read some things and
[50:18] get into some scripture to help with
[50:20] this but there's
[50:21] many part the the thing to understand
[50:23] here there's many many parts of the
[50:25] scripture
[50:26] that were purposely written by god
[50:30] to not be able to be understood
[50:34] a human by intellect by knowledge by
[50:37] reading
[50:38] you'll never get it it won't come that
[50:41] way
[50:41] it cannot and does not come that way yes
[50:44] amen
[50:45] it has to come by inspiration it has to
[50:48] come
[50:48] by revelation that being said i want to
[50:51] read another scripture
[50:52] to solidify this second timothy chapter
[50:55] 3
[51:02] 2 timothy chapter 3. i want to begin
[51:05] reading with verse 16.
[51:09] now there's actually being that
[51:13] that many parts of the scripture were
[51:15] written
[51:16] purposely not to be understood even
[51:19] brother branham said god will allow me
[51:20] to say things just to throw people
[51:22] off you know that yes he said
[51:25] god will allow him to say things and
[51:27] you'll look and say oh my goodness
[51:29] where did he come up with that well i'm
[51:31] sure they thought the same thing in john
[51:33] 6 when jesus said unless you eat my
[51:35] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[51:37] life
[51:37] in me they're probably standing there
[51:38] thinking my goodness where did he come
[51:40] up with that
[51:41] amen it was purposely put there just to
[51:45] throw them off
[51:47] amen because only the predestined are
[51:49] the ones that are going to see this
[51:51] and have it revealed those that are born
[51:54] again and filled with the holy ghost
[51:55] the only ones that are going to gain the
[51:57] revelation of what it's saying
[52:00] what god is speaking to you the word
[52:03] speaking back
[52:05] don't mean to tell you that that meant a
[52:07] lot to me when the lord showed that to
[52:08] me the other day
[52:09] amen now uh second timothy uh chapter 3
[52:13] verse 16.
[52:15] all scripture all scripture
[52:18] not part of it not just the new
[52:21] testament
[52:22] not just a word here there all scripture
[52:26] is given by inspiration of god
[52:30] amen that inspiration what is that
[52:32] inspiration that inspiration is a
[52:33] revelation
[52:34] right god inspires it to you what is
[52:37] that inspiration that inspiration is god
[52:40] opens that word so you can see it how
[52:43] many times brother random called this a
[52:45] love letter from christ to the church a
[52:48] love letter
[52:49] what is a love letter you write things
[52:51] he had an example
[52:52] he mentioned about his wife and you know
[52:54] he said he's out of town and
[52:56] he gets a love letter of course today it
[52:58] would be a text
[53:00] or or an email or something like that
[53:03] a lot just put the kids to bed i'm lying
[53:05] in bed and i'm really missing you now
[53:07] and
[53:07] he says you know she's saying this but i
[53:11] know what she means
[53:13] because i'm her husband she's my spouse
[53:16] she's my wife i know what she means
[53:19] she's not saying it right out directly
[53:21] but i know what she's saying
[53:24] because remember you talked about
[53:25] reading between the lines well but in
[53:27] between the lines
[53:28] is matching what's on the line amen
[53:30] right right so
[53:32] that's the love letter that god has
[53:34] wrote to us see people can look at it
[53:36] and say
[53:36] well it says this and i'm not trying to
[53:40] get into a part of saying yep
[53:42] you know but it uh you know but what did
[53:44] he mean
[53:45] i don't want to assume that but i do
[53:48] want to understand that there's a
[53:49] revelation that comes from the word
[53:51] that you don't see in the letter of the
[53:54] word
[53:55] and that's the holy spirit that's the
[53:57] spirit of god
[53:59] remember the bible is not this book
[54:03] this is just ink on a paper the bible is
[54:07] jesus
[54:07] christ a living risen savior
[54:11] that's the word amen this is just ink on
[54:14] pages
[54:15] this is just a part of brother bram said
[54:18] just
[54:19] a part of god that he put so we can see
[54:22] it that it could be revealed to us amen
[54:25] so that spirit could come in so that
[54:28] revelation
[54:29] could come in it's because of the ink on
[54:32] the pages
[54:33] praise the lord but it's just the word
[54:36] and all the word
[54:38] is given to you i don't mean to add to
[54:41] the scripture
[54:42] but it's given to you by inspiration
[54:45] of god so it takes god to do it
[54:49] many seminaries you want to right you
[54:51] can become the most educated brilliant
[54:53] genius in the planet earth but unless
[54:56] god inspires it you'll never see it
[54:59] right
[55:00] yeah you'll never see it oh what she
[55:02] said he missed she misses it oh she
[55:04] misses and that's nice
[55:05] no that's not what the that's not what
[55:06] the letter meant
[55:08] the letter d yeah she misses him but it
[55:11] goes so much
[55:12] deeper than that because there's a
[55:13] relationship
[55:16] praise the lord there's a relationship i
[55:19] wanted to talk about
[55:20] that relationship today but anyway
[55:22] there's a relationship there when there
[55:24] is
[55:24] you know what is it speaking to me
[55:28] all the scriptures given by inspiration
[55:30] of god
[55:31] it is profitable for doctrine for
[55:33] reproof for correction for instruction
[55:35] in righteousness
[55:36] that the man of god may be perfect
[55:38] thoroughly furnished unto
[55:40] all good works thoroughly furnished
[55:42] finished that's
[55:44] completed through what the inspiration
[55:46] or revelation of the word
[55:48] amen that's when it that's when a
[55:50] completion comes
[55:52] the man of god may be perfect well the
[55:55] man is just a general
[55:56] uh uh you've heard me say many times
[55:59] just
[56:00] a man is in humanity not just a man
[56:03] amen i'm looking at many sisters here
[56:04] this morning and it's the same thing
[56:06] with you
[56:06] not just man but humanity
[56:10] that's what he stole the humanity come
[56:12] to a place of perfection how
[56:14] by the inspiration of god's word by the
[56:17] revelation of god's word
[56:18] we are made complete and that's what
[56:21] that perfect means
[56:23] a full age complete you've reached a
[56:25] place of wanting nothing
[56:27] amen amen maturity that perfect
[56:31] thoroughly furnished to all good works
[56:34] thirdly furnished means you have all
[56:35] that you need
[56:36] now you know maybe if you're a
[56:38] millionaire or something you might have
[56:39] a house full of furniture and you still
[56:41] want a piece of furniture or something
[56:42] you know you don't have a square inch of
[56:44] carpet to put it on
[56:46] because you got a bunch of money you got
[56:47] to go another you got to go not buy
[56:49] another pair of shoes
[56:50] you got to go and buy another dress you
[56:51] got to go buy another piece of furniture
[56:54] amen because you got all kinds of money
[56:55] so you got to spend it right but
[56:57] normally when you have a house full of
[56:59] furniture you don't go by more
[57:01] right you've got what you need
[57:06] why it's it's fully furnished it's
[57:08] complete
[57:09] you look at it you say it is complete
[57:12] amen
[57:12] i don't know if me and my wife's ever
[57:14] had a house like that before but we've
[57:15] tried
[57:16] in 36 years uh to have that i don't
[57:19] think we have to this point but maybe
[57:21] one day
[57:22] but fortunately spiritually i believe
[57:25] that's been attained
[57:27] amen by the word of god by the
[57:28] inspiration revelation of the word
[57:31] modern events made clear by prophecy
[57:34] you see the scripture is inspiration
[57:37] you'll never listen to what he says now
[57:40] you'll
[57:41] never be able to know the scripture just
[57:44] by sitting down
[57:45] and reading it from a theological
[57:47] standpoint right
[57:49] from an educational standpoint it will
[57:52] never work never has
[57:55] worked he says so i was speaking to a
[57:59] minister
[57:59] not long ago he said brother until we
[58:02] learned the greek and so forth he said
[58:04] all
[58:04] he said in the united state council
[58:07] before they were arguing the greek words
[58:09] in the bible
[58:10] he says you'll never know it the bible
[58:12] is to be revealed
[58:14] to be revealed by inspiration
[58:20] all scripture is given by inspiration
[58:23] from who not from me not from brother
[58:27] brown
[58:28] but from god yes amen
[58:31] doesn't i just it's just i love how
[58:33] beautifully god dovetails the things
[58:35] that we've just been talking about over
[58:36] the past few weeks
[58:37] amen all of it it just all comes from
[58:39] him it's not us
[58:41] god looks for willing subjects again
[58:44] that he can use to speak through
[58:46] but it's god that does it right amen
[58:48] it's god that brings
[58:50] it to fruition so it's him that's doing
[58:52] it the bible is to be revealed by
[58:54] inspiration that's the only thing
[58:58] the revelation jesus told peter upon
[59:00] this rock this revelation
[59:02] reveals who he is blessed art thou simon
[59:04] son of jonas flesh and blood has not
[59:06] revealed this to you
[59:07] but my father which is in heaven has
[59:09] revealed this to you and upon this rock
[59:12] i will build my church what rock not the
[59:14] catholic church not even peter but the
[59:16] rock of the revelation
[59:18] of who jesus christ is the revealed word
[59:21] inspired to you amen
[59:25] not peter himself but upon the spiritual
[59:28] revelation
[59:29] of who jesus is amen or he says was or
[59:33] was standing there
[59:34] amen that's spiritual revelation now
[59:38] as we know now there are many there are
[59:41] many parts of the bible that may
[59:42] look plain to people it may look plain
[59:46] as you read it but it really isn't
[59:48] because there's something in there that
[59:50] that without the inspiration not the
[59:52] holy ghost without god revealing it
[59:54] you'll never see it it won't be seen
[59:57] there's things in here i still have on
[1:00:01] the shelf
[1:00:02] lord i i don't understand that i don't
[1:00:05] understand why brother brown said this
[1:00:06] or i don't understand how this
[1:00:08] but god knows yes and if i have need of
[1:00:11] knowing or when i have knee of knowing
[1:00:13] he'll show to me
[1:00:14] as he's done many many times and i'm so
[1:00:17] thankful for that
[1:00:18] things that i've had such a quandary
[1:00:20] over for years sometimes
[1:00:22] years and one day they'll just
[1:00:25] drop it down for item for whatever
[1:00:27] reason i said well thank you lord
[1:00:29] there it is and then it just becomes
[1:00:31] plain it's not a mystery anymore
[1:00:33] it's the same words it's the exact same
[1:00:37] words in the bible and the word didn't
[1:00:39] change
[1:00:40] it's just the enlightenment of the holy
[1:00:42] spirit giving it to me
[1:00:44] amen there's your difference so many
[1:00:47] scriptures
[1:00:48] they they might look plain but they
[1:00:50] really aren't
[1:00:52] amen they really aren't there are
[1:00:54] several scriptures in the bible
[1:00:56] and many prophecies through the bible
[1:00:58] this is why we're to get to my text
[1:01:00] many prophecies through the bible that
[1:01:03] have
[1:01:04] uh that we talked about this a little
[1:01:06] bit again
[1:01:07] this is going to be a continuation of
[1:01:10] sort of what i laid last week or kind of
[1:01:13] skipped
[1:01:14] the highlights of i want to go a little
[1:01:16] deeper
[1:01:18] there's many parts many scriptures many
[1:01:21] prophecies in the scripture
[1:01:22] that have dual meanings they have
[1:01:25] compound meanings
[1:01:27] many scriptures let's turn to one
[1:01:30] matthew chapter 2.
[1:01:38] now remember you can't just read the
[1:01:40] word
[1:01:42] as as a a point of knowledge
[1:01:47] and i've said this before and i'll say
[1:01:49] it again and i don't know why but i just
[1:01:51] feel inspired to
[1:01:52] maybe somebody sitting here maybe
[1:01:54] somebody's watching maybe somebody will
[1:01:56] watch it
[1:01:59] and and you do what you feel that to do
[1:02:01] i'm not telling anybody what to do
[1:02:04] brother branham obviously endorsed the
[1:02:06] king james version of the bible
[1:02:08] he had a thompson change study i believe
[1:02:10] he did he had a scofield that he studied
[1:02:12] bible
[1:02:14] but i've had people tell me
[1:02:18] and again i'm not telling you what to do
[1:02:20] but i've had people tell me
[1:02:21] nobody here that they have to get this
[1:02:24] certain
[1:02:25] translation because they can't
[1:02:28] understand it they
[1:02:29] understand this translation better
[1:02:33] and i try to tell them without offending
[1:02:36] them the best i can
[1:02:38] i try to tell them look it would appear
[1:02:42] as though
[1:02:42] you're trying to read the bible to gain
[1:02:46] knowledge from it if you're doing that
[1:02:50] you're
[1:02:50] you're reading it for the wrong purpose
[1:02:52] you're reading it in the wrong way
[1:02:54] right the bible is not given to us
[1:02:58] to gain theological knowledge from
[1:03:01] it's not to enhance any doctrine
[1:03:05] the word is given to us to change us
[1:03:09] and to mold us and to make us in the
[1:03:12] image of the word
[1:03:13] which is christ to reveal it to us
[1:03:17] not something that you can have a
[1:03:19] knowledge that you can go argue down the
[1:03:21] street with somebody about it right
[1:03:23] right i'm not saying that that that we
[1:03:25] can't that you don't have bible studies
[1:03:27] or discuss
[1:03:28] this point or that one or something
[1:03:29] that's perfectly fine
[1:03:31] right but you can't garner that with
[1:03:34] just a simple knowledge
[1:03:35] so if you're if you think you've got to
[1:03:37] get a certain translation and you do
[1:03:39] whatever again you do whatever you feel
[1:03:41] like to do
[1:03:42] whoever you are that's fine but if
[1:03:45] you're
[1:03:46] but if you do it because i understand
[1:03:48] this one better
[1:03:50] there needs to be sounds to me there
[1:03:53] needs to be more of a prayer for an
[1:03:54] inspiration of the word
[1:03:56] not a knowledge of the word right now
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:00] because if it's if it's necessary
[1:04:04] now none of us have it necessary but if
[1:04:07] it were necessary
[1:04:09] and you were a child of god and this
[1:04:12] book was written in swahili
[1:04:14] you could read it right amen god would
[1:04:17] reveal it to you
[1:04:19] anyway yes if there was a need if you
[1:04:22] had to
[1:04:22] and there was no other way to know it
[1:04:26] there was times back in the old uh uh
[1:04:29] dark ages they didn't have this
[1:04:31] scripture they didn't have this bible
[1:04:33] they didn't have the luxury we have
[1:04:35] to have this thing on print how did god
[1:04:37] get to those people
[1:04:40] amen if he had to do it
[1:04:43] you could read this no matter what
[1:04:45] language or what it looked like or
[1:04:47] how it was trying to be hidden god would
[1:04:50] still reveal it to you
[1:04:52] amen so you can say well this looks a
[1:04:55] little plainer and this makes more sense
[1:04:57] and whatever
[1:04:57] be careful you might find something in
[1:05:00] there that doesn't belong there that's
[1:05:02] right
[1:05:02] or or in your mind i should say
[1:05:05] everything that's in there belongs there
[1:05:06] but in your mind because oh i
[1:05:10] i understand it now no i know we use
[1:05:13] that verb which i use it too
[1:05:15] because it starts sometimes our limited
[1:05:18] uh
[1:05:18] english right just like we use the word
[1:05:20] love
[1:05:21] you go in the bible you see there's
[1:05:23] several loves right but we just use one
[1:05:25] word
[1:05:26] but anyway so it's got to come by
[1:05:30] revelation
[1:05:31] inspiration now again many parts of the
[1:05:34] scripture
[1:05:35] have dual purposes dual meanings uh
[1:05:38] matthew chapter 2 verse 13. let's read
[1:05:41] this
[1:05:43] and when they were departed of course
[1:05:45] tomorrow joseph and barry and jesus and
[1:05:48] when they were departed behold the
[1:05:49] angels of the lord appeared to joseph in
[1:05:51] the dream saying arise
[1:05:53] take the young child and his mother and
[1:05:55] flee into
[1:05:56] egypt and be thou there until i bring
[1:05:59] thee word
[1:06:00] for herod for herod will seek the young
[1:06:04] child to destroy him
[1:06:06] when he rose he took the young child and
[1:06:09] his mother by night
[1:06:10] and departed into egypt and was there
[1:06:13] until the death of herod that it might
[1:06:16] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[1:06:18] lord by the prophet saying by the
[1:06:20] prophet
[1:06:21] so this was a prophecy that god spoke
[1:06:25] through a prophet
[1:06:27] saying out of egypt have i called my son
[1:06:31] now if you look at that
[1:06:34] and you see it just as it's written you
[1:06:37] say oh well that's true if you're
[1:06:38] talking about jesus
[1:06:39] this whole thing is talking about this
[1:06:41] whole story
[1:06:43] is referring to joseph and mary and then
[1:06:46] jesus
[1:06:47] and then what what was happening to
[1:06:49] jesus that it would be a fulfillment of
[1:06:51] of that prophecy of of of him coming
[1:06:55] out of egypt see and then you just leave
[1:06:58] it there oh okay well praise the lord
[1:07:00] the scripture is talking about that's
[1:07:02] the fulfillment of that scripture
[1:07:04] out of egypt have i called my son
[1:07:08] but there's more to that scripture amen
[1:07:12] there's more to that scripture if you go
[1:07:14] to
[1:07:15] other scripture which we're going to do
[1:07:17] and i told you to keep your bible handy
[1:07:19] in exodus chapter 4.
[1:07:24] i want us to see this because some
[1:07:26] people don't believe that
[1:07:29] and i'm not saying it's anybody in this
[1:07:31] church it's not but there's some people
[1:07:33] i have talked to people i've witnessed
[1:07:35] to them they don't believe
[1:07:37] that there's a there are dual meanings
[1:07:40] to certain scriptures they think that
[1:07:41] that's
[1:07:42] exactly what it is and that's all it is
[1:07:45] they don't see the
[1:07:46] the compound meaning or the dual purpose
[1:07:49] of a prophecy sometimes
[1:07:51] or something that would clearly if you
[1:07:54] just read it by knowledge that's jesus
[1:07:56] got it done over you move on
[1:07:59] then you miss a whole nother part of
[1:08:01] what jesus was saying
[1:08:03] what the word is saying exodus chapter 4
[1:08:07] verse 19. and the lord said unto moses
[1:08:11] in midian
[1:08:12] go return into egypt for all the men are
[1:08:15] dead which sought by life
[1:08:17] and moses took his wife and his sons and
[1:08:20] set them upon an ass and he returned to
[1:08:22] the land of egypt and moses took the rod
[1:08:24] of god in his hand
[1:08:25] the lord said unto moses when thou goest
[1:08:28] to return unto
[1:08:29] egypt see that thou do all these wonders
[1:08:32] before pharaoh
[1:08:33] which i have put in thine hand but i
[1:08:36] will harden his heart
[1:08:38] that he shall not let the people go
[1:08:42] and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus
[1:08:44] saith the lord
[1:08:46] israel is my son
[1:08:49] even my firstborn and i
[1:08:52] say unto thee let my son go
[1:08:56] that he may serve me and if thou refuse
[1:08:58] to let him go
[1:09:00] behold i will slay thy son even my first
[1:09:02] born now who's god talking about there
[1:09:05] again a prophecy again
[1:09:09] the lord speaking now what's he saying
[1:09:14] it's just like saying
[1:09:17] the bible says that god is jesus
[1:09:20] father but then when you read in the
[1:09:24] in the new testament when christ is born
[1:09:27] it says that he is of the holy ghost
[1:09:30] well now if you're a trinitarian and you
[1:09:32] believe in three separate entities
[1:09:35] god father son holy ghost and you got
[1:09:37] three of them up here orchestrating this
[1:09:39] whole deal
[1:09:41] and you say god is jesus father but now
[1:09:44] it says he's not the holy ghost well
[1:09:46] which one is it
[1:09:48] see without spiritual understanding and
[1:09:50] revelation
[1:09:51] of what the word is saying you wouldn't
[1:09:53] know without a true instruction of the
[1:09:56] godhead
[1:09:57] right you say well he said my father
[1:10:00] well there's got to be at least
[1:10:02] two of them see without spiritual
[1:10:04] understanding without a revelation of
[1:10:06] the entirety of god revealing that word
[1:10:08] to you
[1:10:09] all scripture is given by inspiration
[1:10:11] then you miss the thing entirely
[1:10:16] it doesn't make sense so how did the
[1:10:19] christian world
[1:10:20] reconcile it oh there's got to be three
[1:10:22] of them
[1:10:23] and then they make an excuse to say well
[1:10:26] god's his father
[1:10:27] but the bible says he's of the holy
[1:10:29] ghost you've made him an illegitimate
[1:10:30] child now he's got two daddies
[1:10:32] who's his daddy amen
[1:10:37] you see where the common knowledge
[1:10:39] misses the vision
[1:10:41] where a common understanding of the
[1:10:43] scripture can't catch the revelation
[1:10:45] of what the word is speaking to you
[1:10:47] about
[1:10:48] hear god is saved thus
[1:10:52] saith the lord israel is my son
[1:10:57] now was israel brought up out of egypt
[1:11:01] amen amen yes it was
[1:11:06] took them 400 plus years but they were
[1:11:10] delivered out of egypt now let me ask
[1:11:13] you
[1:11:14] is matthew 2 only talking about jesus
[1:11:21] no matthew 2 is not only
[1:11:24] talking about jesus it's also talking
[1:11:27] about how
[1:11:28] god raised up a prophet moses
[1:11:32] spoke to moses to bring a children of
[1:11:34] israel out of
[1:11:35] egypt and god spoke through moses
[1:11:40] and said this is my son
[1:11:44] but now that doesn't negate that jesus
[1:11:46] was as well
[1:11:49] you understand okay well
[1:11:52] let's go to the next one uh
[1:11:56] hosea 11
[1:11:59] hosea 11 1.
[1:12:08] hosea 11 1 says when israel was a child
[1:12:12] then i loved him and called my son out
[1:12:15] of
[1:12:15] egypt okay a prophecy went forth
[1:12:20] that his son would be called out of
[1:12:23] egypt
[1:12:24] well now is it israel his son or is it
[1:12:27] jesus his son see if you stop at one
[1:12:31] part
[1:12:32] you completely miss a whole another part
[1:12:34] of the scripture
[1:12:35] and there's so much more just behind
[1:12:38] that that we just don't have time to go
[1:12:39] into
[1:12:40] right now the purpose and the reason for
[1:12:42] that
[1:12:43] then you lose you lose a whole other
[1:12:46] section of the bible
[1:12:47] that you can't reconcile with the rest
[1:12:49] of the new testament
[1:12:50] because you don't know the understanding
[1:12:52] or revelation of what is saved
[1:12:56] you miss a whole half of the purpose of
[1:12:59] the prophecy
[1:13:00] that god gave to that prophet it's lost
[1:13:04] you don't even know it and a lot of
[1:13:07] people can't understand it today
[1:13:10] that's why it has to come by inspiration
[1:13:13] that's why it has to come by revelation
[1:13:15] brother branham gave nobody a revelation
[1:13:17] friend no one no one
[1:13:18] right amen amen nor could i for amen
[1:13:22] no matter how great an understanding of
[1:13:24] a scripture or of a doctrine you have
[1:13:26] you can't give it to anybody else right
[1:13:29] you can witness to them and try to lead
[1:13:31] them to christ but only
[1:13:32] god can bring that inspiration only god
[1:13:35] can reveal it
[1:13:36] amen only god can do it and to try to
[1:13:40] help people understand where we stand in
[1:13:43] this day
[1:13:44] see because we know now i'm going to get
[1:13:47] into this is the last part i want to get
[1:13:48] into today
[1:13:49] i've got several more scriptures i want
[1:13:51] to read but this is the last part i want
[1:13:53] to get to
[1:13:54] we we hit the highlights last week we
[1:13:56] know there's five
[1:13:57] times we can find it in the scripture
[1:14:01] you say well brother ryan said yes he
[1:14:03] did but you can find it in the scripture
[1:14:05] what he he said a lot of people can't
[1:14:07] find what he said in scripture because
[1:14:08] they don't know the scripture
[1:14:10] right and they say well it says hear
[1:14:12] this yeah but if you don't understand
[1:14:14] the rest of the inspiration then you
[1:14:16] can't get the full picture
[1:14:18] yeah amen okay i hope we got that now
[1:14:22] there's the the dual purpose it means
[1:14:25] many times of prophecies in scriptures
[1:14:28] five times use of the elijah spirit
[1:14:31] four are very plain in the scripture
[1:14:34] and remember much of the scripture is
[1:14:37] written so it won't be just seen and
[1:14:39] understood by the comet
[1:14:41] by knowledge or by theological
[1:14:43] understanding
[1:14:44] okay i want to delay that again four of
[1:14:47] them are pretty plain
[1:14:49] scriptural the fifth one is
[1:14:53] brought by inspiration to see where it's
[1:14:56] before it sits it's actually the fourth
[1:14:58] not the fifth but you know what i'm
[1:15:00] saying
[1:15:00] four of them uh the the first second
[1:15:03] third and fifth are pretty plain the
[1:15:05] fourth one is
[1:15:06] is uh is revealed to a people that will
[1:15:09] believe
[1:15:10] it for a message of this last day
[1:15:13] the first spirit the first fulfillment
[1:15:17] of that elijah spirit now now you got it
[1:15:20] you got to know your bible
[1:15:22] and you got to follow brother green said
[1:15:24] it many times
[1:15:26] uh but we got to follow their natures
[1:15:29] we we got to follow their uh uh their
[1:15:33] uh their natures the way of their acting
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:38] and the ways that they did things and
[1:15:40] the the desires the things they loved
[1:15:42] and the things they hated
[1:15:45] brother around brother greene he could
[1:15:47] rattle off the four or five things just
[1:15:49] like a
[1:15:50] a machine gun
[1:15:54] the spirit of elijah loved the
[1:15:56] wilderness had no
[1:15:57] uh desire for wealth or fame hated the
[1:16:00] jezebel spirit blah blah blah
[1:16:02] i don't remember them all to give them
[1:16:04] all but those things but to know the
[1:16:06] scripture
[1:16:07] you can follow their natures if you read
[1:16:09] the story of elijah and see how elijah
[1:16:11] was
[1:16:12] you could read the story of elisha and
[1:16:14] see how elisha was
[1:16:16] and say wow they they kind of married
[1:16:18] mirrored each other
[1:16:20] if you jump over to john the baptist you
[1:16:21] could say oh my he acted in his nature
[1:16:24] the way he conducted himself the things
[1:16:26] he said mirrored a lot of the way how
[1:16:29] elijah and elisha were
[1:16:31] why is that because they were of the
[1:16:33] same spirit
[1:16:35] that same spirit that same anointing
[1:16:38] amen a lot of people don't understand
[1:16:40] well how did how did the spirit come out
[1:16:42] of elijah and go into this man
[1:16:44] no it's not that it's not the man's
[1:16:47] literal spirit
[1:16:49] but it's that anointing that that uh
[1:16:53] that's that's on that person
[1:16:56] that made them who they were not the
[1:16:58] man's literal spirit
[1:17:00] but the nature of that person see i mean
[1:17:03] you can have that
[1:17:04] i mean how many in here like steak
[1:17:07] just me normal okay
[1:17:11] now that that doesn't mean my spirits
[1:17:13] came out of my body went into brother
[1:17:14] john over the pattern system
[1:17:16] norma amen or or my daughter
[1:17:20] or my mother it just means that we
[1:17:23] share that in common it's a part of the
[1:17:25] nature of the pace that we have that we
[1:17:27] enjoy amen uh how many in here like
[1:17:31] sushi
[1:17:35] i can't put my hand any lower than that
[1:17:38] amen
[1:17:39] but you will see that's my son
[1:17:42] obviously that didn't come out of me
[1:17:44] into him
[1:17:47] he's of that nature right i mean how
[1:17:49] many people like to hunt you don't have
[1:17:50] to raise your hands anymore
[1:17:52] i mean like to fish i mean like to golf
[1:17:55] how many like to drive fast cars how
[1:17:58] many like to
[1:17:59] uh uh work with their hands how many
[1:18:01] like to work with their brains
[1:18:03] how many uh i mean you could go on and
[1:18:06] on and on
[1:18:08] and understand the characteristics of
[1:18:10] each other that that doesn't that
[1:18:11] doesn't make
[1:18:13] mean that the spirit of one person can't
[1:18:15] that actual literal spirit came and went
[1:18:16] to that other person just means
[1:18:18] you're of that same type nature you have
[1:18:21] that same type of
[1:18:22] of of taste if you will right whatever
[1:18:26] it is
[1:18:26] sometimes it's because the way you're
[1:18:28] raised sometimes it's because of where
[1:18:30] you were raised
[1:18:31] sometimes it's absolutely opposite of
[1:18:33] where you were raised my mother hated
[1:18:35] ketchup almost because it was too hot
[1:18:39] i mean i don't i don't eat ketchup
[1:18:42] because it's not hot
[1:18:45] so did that how does that equate i'm her
[1:18:48] son
[1:18:49] but you understand that those
[1:18:52] natures those anointings
[1:18:55] that was on them was the same type of
[1:18:57] anointing
[1:18:59] it made them desire the same type things
[1:19:02] it made them dislike the same type
[1:19:05] things
[1:19:07] they were wilderness men and what other
[1:19:10] wilderness man do we know that
[1:19:14] didn't have a desire for wealth or fame
[1:19:17] that didn't uh that hated the jezebel
[1:19:20] spirit they loved the wilderness
[1:19:22] and so forth you've got to follow
[1:19:25] that trend you've got to know the
[1:19:28] scripture to follow those
[1:19:29] natures and see the fulfillment of that
[1:19:31] scripture
[1:19:33] something is going to fulfill that
[1:19:35] scripture because
[1:19:36] all scripture is given by inspiration
[1:19:39] all scripture
[1:19:40] will be fulfilled we know that just by
[1:19:43] what the
[1:19:44] scripture tells us okay so
[1:19:48] the first one is very plain elijah
[1:19:52] elijah was the original prophet standard
[1:19:56] barrier
[1:19:57] that we look at of that nature type of
[1:20:00] person
[1:20:01] elijah was the man he was the first one
[1:20:04] he got raptured
[1:20:06] he threw back his mantle to a man that
[1:20:08] asked god
[1:20:10] through elijah he wanted a double
[1:20:13] portion of that same
[1:20:14] what spirit that same
[1:20:17] anointing elijah threw his mantle down
[1:20:21] he didn't remove the spirit from his
[1:20:23] body and throw it down to it
[1:20:24] into his mantle down the anointing
[1:20:27] transferred over to elisha
[1:20:29] and elisha then was the same type man
[1:20:32] did the same type things
[1:20:34] as elijah did right fulfilling that
[1:20:37] second double portion or that second
[1:20:40] uh spirit of elijah that wasn't a man
[1:20:44] the third was john the baptist i want to
[1:20:47] read some scripture
[1:20:49] in isaiah chapter 40
[1:20:52] that's the first place i want to go
[1:20:54] isaiah chapter 40.
[1:20:58] you can look at john the baptist again
[1:21:00] see his nature
[1:21:02] we talked about him last week he'd go in
[1:21:04] the wilderness
[1:21:05] and god would speak to him he'd come out
[1:21:07] like a wild man beard hanging down
[1:21:11] animal skins on him and wild locusts and
[1:21:14] honey and
[1:21:15] scream and repent baptizing them
[1:21:19] pointing to jesus all the things that
[1:21:23] john did
[1:21:24] nail in the height of the pharisees and
[1:21:26] sadducees to the wall
[1:21:29] the men that were learned men how could
[1:21:32] john the baptist out do them in
[1:21:35] in scripture when their whole life was
[1:21:38] wound in scripture
[1:21:40] and this man just spent his life in the
[1:21:41] woods
[1:21:43] how could that be they knew the letter
[1:21:47] they could take the torah and they could
[1:21:49] the scroll they could put it in a circle
[1:21:51] and put a pen through it and knew
[1:21:53] exactly where it get what it said
[1:21:56] they knew it that well but where did
[1:21:59] they know it
[1:22:00] they knew it up here amen they knew it
[1:22:04] as a knowledge
[1:22:05] oh i know what that says i know what
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:08] but when john the baptist came out even
[1:22:10] when jesus came
[1:22:12] they said oh this nobody spake like this
[1:22:14] man before well where did he get it from
[1:22:19] he was 12 years old and could and could
[1:22:22] confound the professors
[1:22:25] where did it come from well first of all
[1:22:27] he was the word
[1:22:28] amen but it's all inspired revealed
[1:22:32] by god a man could come out of the woods
[1:22:35] and do the exact same thing
[1:22:37] a man could raise up with a seventh
[1:22:39] grade education
[1:22:40] and do the same thing
[1:22:43] and he did it he confounded the
[1:22:46] professors
[1:22:48] he confounded the theologians
[1:22:52] many of them probably still had their
[1:22:53] same ideas but they couldn't
[1:22:55] even that challenge that he gave them
[1:22:58] when they tried to lay a trap for him
[1:22:59] about baptism
[1:23:01] and god showed him what they were going
[1:23:02] to do and they changed the room
[1:23:05] and god changed them program said it's
[1:23:06] like this like this like this
[1:23:08] and he said oh we got him now because we
[1:23:10] got this room so and so and such and
[1:23:11] such and right before they were to go to
[1:23:13] heaven
[1:23:13] they had to change the room he said oh
[1:23:15] sorry we have booked this we got to put
[1:23:16] you in a different room
[1:23:19] the room was exactly like god and show
[1:23:21] brother adam it was going to be
[1:23:24] and brother brown said now any one of
[1:23:26] you
[1:23:27] and you know all the things that he said
[1:23:30] he said now any one of you want to
[1:23:31] challenge me get your bibles and stand
[1:23:33] right
[1:23:34] next to me here and prove me where i'm
[1:23:36] wrong
[1:23:37] a man with a seventh grade education he
[1:23:40] said prove me when i'm wrong
[1:23:42] pastors teachers theologians couldn't do
[1:23:45] it
[1:23:46] they stayed quiet because they knew
[1:23:48] better
[1:23:50] amen how could that be done
[1:23:54] by inspiration by revelation of god
[1:23:58] right now wild man coming out look
[1:24:01] isaiah chapter 40
[1:24:03] verse verse 3
[1:24:08] isaiah 43 the voice of him that cries in
[1:24:11] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:24:14] lord
[1:24:14] make straight in the desert a highway
[1:24:17] for our god
[1:24:18] every valley shall be exalted every
[1:24:21] mountain and hill shall be made low
[1:24:23] the crooked shall be made straight and
[1:24:25] the rough place is plain
[1:24:28] and the glory of the lord shall be
[1:24:30] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[1:24:32] together
[1:24:33] for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
[1:24:36] now
[1:24:36] this man this prophecy
[1:24:40] of a man's voice crying in the
[1:24:42] wilderness
[1:24:45] was to do what prepare the way of the
[1:24:48] lord
[1:24:50] to make the way straight to pave that
[1:24:53] way
[1:24:54] and talks about the hills being loaded
[1:24:55] in the rough places and smooth places
[1:24:58] but it was to pave that way it was to
[1:25:01] lay that foundation for when the first
[1:25:03] coming of christ was to come
[1:25:05] to make a way for the lord that was the
[1:25:08] point
[1:25:09] amen isn't that the point of that man's
[1:25:11] ministry
[1:25:12] whose ministry the ministry of the voice
[1:25:14] crying in the wilderness
[1:25:16] his ministry was to prepare the way of
[1:25:18] the lord
[1:25:19] and make straight that way
[1:25:22] amen lay that foundation that was what
[1:25:25] his ministry was to be
[1:25:27] malachi chapter 3
[1:25:33] malachi chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:25:37] i i was going to wait for to turn but
[1:25:39] i'm gonna go ahead and go because it's
[1:25:40] getting a little bit late on me now
[1:25:42] uh malachi 3 1 behold i will send my
[1:25:46] messenger
[1:25:47] and he shall prepare the way before me
[1:25:53] and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[1:25:55] come to his temple
[1:25:57] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[1:25:59] ye delight in behold he shall come
[1:26:01] saith the lord of hosts now who does
[1:26:04] that sound like
[1:26:05] sounds like isaiah 43 amen
[1:26:09] i'll send my messenger who is that
[1:26:11] messenger that's the message of the man
[1:26:13] of the voice
[1:26:14] crying in the wilderness who's going to
[1:26:17] prepare the way of the lord amen
[1:26:20] to make his way straight and prepare
[1:26:23] that way
[1:26:24] for the lord to suddenly come into that
[1:26:26] temple
[1:26:28] amen where he stood there and said
[1:26:31] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:26:36] praise the lord jesus
[1:26:39] but who is the messenger the man who's
[1:26:43] crying in the wilderness
[1:26:47] we're going to come back to malachi
[1:26:51] in matthew
[1:26:54] chapter 3
[1:27:01] matthew chapter 3
[1:27:04] let's see here matthew chapter 3
[1:27:08] starting with verse 1. in those days
[1:27:11] came john the baptist
[1:27:12] preaching in the wilderness of judea in
[1:27:14] the where
[1:27:16] wilderness of judea saying repent ye for
[1:27:18] the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[1:27:20] for this is he who was spoken of by the
[1:27:24] prophet isaiah
[1:27:25] isaiah saying the voice of one or
[1:27:29] isaiah the voice of one crying at the
[1:27:32] wilderness
[1:27:34] preparing you the way of the lord make
[1:27:36] his path straight
[1:27:37] that's pretty plain right john the
[1:27:40] baptist john the baptist was that
[1:27:42] fulfillment of the messenger
[1:27:44] from isaiah 4 and 3.
[1:27:47] he is the fulfillment of that prophet
[1:27:51] of the voice crying in the wilderness of
[1:27:54] malachi 3 and 1 preparing the way of the
[1:27:57] lord
[1:27:58] making his way straight plain and simple
[1:28:01] because john the baptist forerunned the
[1:28:04] first coming of christ
[1:28:06] that fulfilled that scripture that let
[1:28:09] us know that that was the scripture
[1:28:11] that that god was referring to when he
[1:28:14] had
[1:28:15] uh a prophecy prophesied let's go back
[1:28:18] to malachi now
[1:28:20] malachi 4 because john we're not done
[1:28:22] with john quite yet
[1:28:24] malachi 4 and 6.
[1:28:30] malachi 4 6 says and he shall turn the
[1:28:33] heart of the
[1:28:34] fathers to the children and the heart
[1:28:38] of the children to their fathers lest i
[1:28:41] come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:28:43] now who is this he that he's talking
[1:28:46] about
[1:28:48] this he is the spirit of elijah
[1:28:51] right that same anointing that same
[1:28:55] spirit
[1:28:56] now if you just looked at that and you
[1:28:58] followed it up from malachi 3 it said
[1:29:01] well that's just john the baptist
[1:29:03] and you would stop because you'd see
[1:29:06] well that that that seems plain and
[1:29:08] simple that's john the baptist
[1:29:10] i see it that's it let's move on into
[1:29:13] the subject
[1:29:16] did you talk to them
[1:29:20] you would forget about it it's done
[1:29:21] that's john the baptist let's move on
[1:29:23] and that's what so many people do
[1:29:26] but see they miss the compound purpose
[1:29:29] of this scripture
[1:29:33] john the baptist was the
[1:29:36] beginning portion of of course he was
[1:29:39] the
[1:29:39] first forerunner of the first coming of
[1:29:41] christ of
[1:29:43] of christ coming with a
[1:29:46] change in dispensation from the old
[1:29:50] testament and the law
[1:29:52] to grace and the and the message going
[1:29:56] to the gentile bribe
[1:29:57] amen from the old law from the crossing
[1:30:00] of the hands we talked to last week
[1:30:01] the blessing right-hand blessing going
[1:30:03] to the younger child the gentile
[1:30:05] from the from uh from the time of christ
[1:30:09] and that changing of that dispensation
[1:30:11] john the baptist was that for that
[1:30:14] forerunner
[1:30:16] what was the purpose of that forerunner
[1:30:20] the purpose of that forerunner was to
[1:30:23] turn the hearts of the father to the
[1:30:24] children amen
[1:30:27] now look when my when my
[1:30:29] great-granddaddy
[1:30:30] was alive he didn't know me
[1:30:33] he didn't know my daddy
[1:30:36] he certainly would have never known my
[1:30:38] son because i never knew him
[1:30:40] but he was always my son was always in
[1:30:43] him right
[1:30:44] he didn't know him but he was there so
[1:30:47] he's
[1:30:48] looking forward why now the second part
[1:30:50] of this the heart of the children to
[1:30:52] their fathers
[1:30:52] now how could my great-grandfather have
[1:30:55] looked from
[1:30:56] him back he didn't even know him
[1:31:00] my great-grandfather didn't even know
[1:31:02] that my son would ever even exist
[1:31:05] so how could there be a ministry of
[1:31:07] bringing from
[1:31:08] forwards back
[1:31:11] the ministry when got when the when the
[1:31:14] ministry of christ came
[1:31:16] the dispensation changed from law to
[1:31:19] grace
[1:31:20] there was a looking forward to what
[1:31:23] christ was going to do in his
[1:31:24] church hallelujah amen it was a looking
[1:31:28] forward the the old testament states had
[1:31:31] already risen
[1:31:32] they had appeared unto many they had
[1:31:34] gone in the rapture
[1:31:36] amen and and that sealed that
[1:31:39] well what was there left to do the
[1:31:41] looking forward
[1:31:43] the looking forward was the message of
[1:31:46] elijah
[1:31:47] to look forward fathers to the children
[1:31:51] amen so that compound purpose
[1:31:55] of malachi 4 5 4 and 6
[1:31:58] is the fulfillment of he elijah's spirit
[1:32:01] being in john the baptist and
[1:32:03] william branham because in this
[1:32:06] last days now you have a turning of the
[1:32:09] faith of the heart of the children
[1:32:12] back to the fathers they looked forward
[1:32:16] and we look back amen right
[1:32:19] not that we look back in the sense of
[1:32:21] looking back you understand what i mean
[1:32:23] but the restoration of that faith to our
[1:32:26] hearts
[1:32:26] from what it was in that day amen
[1:32:30] and i said well don't look back then
[1:32:32] don't read the bible
[1:32:34] because the bible's history that's right
[1:32:36] most of it is his history
[1:32:38] most of the bible is written and
[1:32:39] fulfilled hundreds thousands of years
[1:32:42] ago
[1:32:42] hundreds or thousands of years ago so if
[1:32:44] you don't want to
[1:32:45] look back in history then don't then
[1:32:47] don't read the bible
[1:32:50] but that's the whole point we now are
[1:32:54] looking back so that elijah
[1:32:58] spirit on john the baptist was looking
[1:33:00] forward
[1:33:01] from the apostolic fathers forward
[1:33:04] to the children through the church ages
[1:33:07] to the gentile bride that was going to
[1:33:09] raise up from
[1:33:10] every church age and then this last age
[1:33:14] was to look back
[1:33:15] and we'll get to that part
[1:33:18] because jesus said this
[1:33:22] and put both of them in perspective
[1:33:26] uh we read this last week matthew
[1:33:28] chapter 17
[1:33:30] matthew chapter 17 verse 10
[1:33:33] and his disciples asked him saying why
[1:33:37] then say the scribes that elias
[1:33:40] must first come and jesus answered and
[1:33:43] said unto them
[1:33:44] elias truly shall
[1:33:48] that is going to come
[1:33:51] he shall come and restore
[1:33:54] all things now
[1:33:58] what did john the baptist restore
[1:34:04] nothing right he wasn't to restore
[1:34:08] anything he was the introducer
[1:34:12] he was the beginner he was the start
[1:34:16] of introducing jesus christ
[1:34:19] he wasn't restoring it if john the
[1:34:22] baptist was to restore
[1:34:24] anything it would be the old law
[1:34:28] he would he would throw and go back into
[1:34:30] the old testament
[1:34:31] and bring all that back up to restored
[1:34:35] jesus did that when he died at calvary
[1:34:39] jesus restored everything from the old
[1:34:41] testament by giving his life in calvary
[1:34:44] dying going to hell and emptying out
[1:34:47] paradise
[1:34:50] well what job was there for restoration
[1:34:52] of john to do there was no restoration
[1:34:56] but jesus said elijah is going to come
[1:34:59] he shall
[1:35:00] come and that elijah's going to restore
[1:35:02] all things
[1:35:04] but i say unto you that elias
[1:35:07] has come already and you knew him not
[1:35:11] now he's speaking to them not of elijah
[1:35:14] not of elisha
[1:35:15] but of john the baptist placing the
[1:35:19] scripture
[1:35:21] in its proper place now again
[1:35:24] if you just looked at that and read it
[1:35:26] with a theological knowledge you say oh
[1:35:28] he's talking about john the baptist oh
[1:35:29] elijah shall come restore all things
[1:35:32] elias has come already they understood
[1:35:33] you talked about john the baptist okay
[1:35:35] that's good seal gun
[1:35:36] finish and move on you missed the whole
[1:35:38] picture right
[1:35:40] you miss every you miss everything about
[1:35:44] revelation 10 7. you miss everything
[1:35:47] about luke 17 30. you missed everything
[1:35:49] about malachi 4
[1:35:50] 5 6. you missed everything that refers
[1:35:53] to
[1:35:53] the forthcoming of that elijah spirit
[1:35:56] you missed the whole thing
[1:35:58] if you don't see it by
[1:36:01] jesus referring to it you miss the whole
[1:36:03] thing if you
[1:36:04] if you just see that as john the baptist
[1:36:06] and it's sealed you forget it you go
[1:36:08] home
[1:36:08] you've missed the whole that whole
[1:36:10] dispensation
[1:36:12] it's gone to you that's right and if you
[1:36:15] only have john the baptist that spirit
[1:36:17] the four times and you you've you've
[1:36:19] you've thrown off the numerology of the
[1:36:21] word
[1:36:22] right five of course is grace and
[1:36:25] faith and jesus j-e-s-u-s and amen five
[1:36:29] is the number of grace
[1:36:30] right in the scripture said
[1:36:33] that that spirit used five times
[1:36:38] then you can catch it and you can see
[1:36:40] now
[1:36:41] every bit of it lines up every bit of it
[1:36:45] reveals itself jesus said
[1:36:48] elias will come and restore all things
[1:36:53] who is he talking about now this is our
[1:36:56] crossover from the third usage of that
[1:36:58] anointing to the fourth who was he
[1:37:01] talking about
[1:37:03] if he could not have scripturally been
[1:37:06] talking about john the baptist
[1:37:08] to restore anything then what was who
[1:37:10] was he talking about
[1:37:12] amen he had to be talking about somebody
[1:37:15] else
[1:37:15] and it had to be somebody else with the
[1:37:17] spirit of elijah right it could not have
[1:37:21] been
[1:37:21] the fifth use of the spirit of elijah in
[1:37:23] revelation 11
[1:37:24] because those two men just come for the
[1:37:27] jews
[1:37:27] right and they did not do any
[1:37:30] restoration
[1:37:31] they just they're getting 144 000
[1:37:33] together
[1:37:34] right that's all their purpose was
[1:37:38] and one of them was elijah moses and
[1:37:41] elijah
[1:37:42] which we could read time's getting away
[1:37:44] but
[1:37:46] it couldn't have been that so would so
[1:37:47] who is he talking about
[1:37:50] there's got to be a fourth to that
[1:37:52] spirit it's got to be a fourth one
[1:37:54] to fulfill that part of the bible
[1:37:58] amen malachi 4. let's go back to it
[1:38:01] again
[1:38:02] malachi 4 5 behold i will
[1:38:06] i will send you elijah the prophet
[1:38:10] amen well that's pretty generic
[1:38:13] already had two of them i will send you
[1:38:17] so if it's okay well then we'll just say
[1:38:20] it's john the baptist
[1:38:21] but now this prophet is going to come
[1:38:24] before the coming of the great and
[1:38:27] dreadful day of the lord
[1:38:30] now as isaiah 4
[1:38:33] wielding his voice crying in the
[1:38:35] wilderness elijah
[1:38:36] was to make the past straight for jesus
[1:38:40] to appear
[1:38:42] amen that wasn't the great and dreadful
[1:38:45] day of the lord
[1:38:45] that was a wonderful time that jesus
[1:38:47] christ was here manifested on earth
[1:38:49] revealing himself
[1:38:50] to his people and manifesting himself in
[1:38:53] the power and manifestation
[1:38:54] of the spirit of god to go to calvary to
[1:38:57] die on a cross to shed his blood
[1:38:59] to redeem a whole generation of people a
[1:39:02] whole
[1:39:03] thousands of years of gen of people
[1:39:08] so what is this man now the prophet
[1:39:11] before the coming of the great and
[1:39:14] dreadful day of the lord even that
[1:39:17] itself has a two-fold
[1:39:19] understanding because the day
[1:39:22] we know that we're living is a
[1:39:25] great day amen do you consider today a
[1:39:28] great day
[1:39:29] i do i think today is a wonderful day
[1:39:34] this is this is a great day that we live
[1:39:36] in friend
[1:39:37] there's never been a time that christ
[1:39:39] has come and the word has been
[1:39:41] manifested and revealed
[1:39:42] and brought to a people for a body
[1:39:44] change and a rapture
[1:39:46] amen amen never been that kind of
[1:39:48] wholesale rapture like that before
[1:39:50] we're living in a blessed day but it's
[1:39:53] also a dreadful day
[1:39:55] yeah right amen and if you don't know
[1:39:57] it's dreadful just walk out on the
[1:39:58] street for five minutes
[1:40:00] and look at what's going on in this
[1:40:01] planet look at the garbage and the filth
[1:40:04] out in the parking lot
[1:40:06] i'm embarrassed almost to be a tucson
[1:40:08] now with all the garbage and trash all
[1:40:10] over this
[1:40:11] i've never seen tucson this bad in my
[1:40:13] life yeah
[1:40:14] the garbage and the trash and the debris
[1:40:17] everywhere everywhere it's just nasty
[1:40:21] i'm i'm
[1:40:22] embarrassed people to come in from i'm
[1:40:25] glad i'm on uber anymore
[1:40:27] for people that come in from out of
[1:40:29] state and look at the trash and the
[1:40:30] garbage all over the place
[1:40:32] it's it's embarrassing but you know
[1:40:35] today is a dreadful day why because
[1:40:37] there's a lot of people that aren't
[1:40:38] going to know what we know
[1:40:40] there's a lot of people that are going
[1:40:41] to be here left when the tribulation
[1:40:43] sets in
[1:40:44] and and it's not going to be a pretty
[1:40:46] picture
[1:40:47] yeah let me just put it that way so yes
[1:40:51] it is a great and dreadful day
[1:40:54] of the lord that forerunner
[1:40:58] who is that forerunner who was that
[1:41:00] elijah
[1:41:01] if it wasn't john the baptist because he
[1:41:03] didn't he didn't forerun
[1:41:04] a great and dreadful day of the lord he
[1:41:08] didn't restore
[1:41:09] anything but who did the restoration
[1:41:14] amen who was the one that brought that
[1:41:16] restoration malachi 4 5 behold
[1:41:19] uh before the coming of the dreaded
[1:41:21] great and dreadful dead lord he shall
[1:41:23] turn the hearts of the father to the
[1:41:24] children
[1:41:25] hearts of the children to the father
[1:41:26] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:41:28] curse
[1:41:29] jesus said again in matthew 17
[1:41:34] that elias would come and restore all
[1:41:37] things
[1:41:38] because from the day of pentecost it all
[1:41:42] fell
[1:41:42] down through the dark ages went into the
[1:41:44] ground had to die and rot
[1:41:46] be resurrected and new to come forth
[1:41:48] into a new
[1:41:49] into a new group amen she's known as the
[1:41:53] bride
[1:41:53] through all church ages into this last
[1:41:56] day
[1:41:56] to restore back that's why this last day
[1:42:00] prophet was to come
[1:42:01] to restore all things
[1:42:05] to take everything not
[1:42:08] serpents see what brother branham's
[1:42:10] revelation or
[1:42:12] should i say original he's not the one
[1:42:14] that came up with serpent seed
[1:42:16] serpent seed was taught for thousands of
[1:42:18] years before brother branham was ever
[1:42:19] here
[1:42:20] amen i i mean in the new testament
[1:42:24] and and from the first church ace down
[1:42:27] people talked about the serpents see
[1:42:30] it wasn't something new it just took the
[1:42:33] gift of that prophet to know hey
[1:42:35] that is truth that is right that is
[1:42:38] scripture
[1:42:38] and restore it back to a to a people
[1:42:42] that the catholic church tore down and
[1:42:45] took away
[1:42:47] and it took the baptism in the name of
[1:42:50] jesus christ isn't new we know that it's
[1:42:52] all through the bible right
[1:42:54] all through the new testament they
[1:42:55] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:42:57] christ
[1:42:58] but of course it died out through niacin
[1:43:00] through the catholic church and
[1:43:02] father son of holy ghost so it took a
[1:43:04] prophet to reach out and said now that's
[1:43:05] the correct baptism
[1:43:06] oh but jesus said father son holy ghost
[1:43:09] oh that's right that's this
[1:43:10] amen this is the revelation of what
[1:43:12] jesus said
[1:43:14] see if you just took that scripture
[1:43:16] father son the holy ghost
[1:43:18] that's what people do okay that's what
[1:43:20] jesus said that's what baptized then
[1:43:22] what do you do with what peter said
[1:43:24] a man that just came out filled with the
[1:43:26] holy ghost
[1:43:28] what do you do with his statement amen
[1:43:30] amen
[1:43:32] he said be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:43:34] christ amen
[1:43:35] amen well now are you going to be
[1:43:38] baptized in the father son the holy
[1:43:39] ghost you can be baptized in the name of
[1:43:41] jesus christ where is god in the son and
[1:43:43] the holy ghost all one
[1:43:44] amen and his name is
[1:43:48] jesus amen praise the lord that's pretty
[1:43:51] simple then right
[1:43:52] but if you took it just at face value
[1:43:54] and you say well that's what it says
[1:43:56] you close it up done finished that's
[1:43:57] what it is that's how we move on now and
[1:43:59] then you miss a whole truth to a baptism
[1:44:02] amen of the truth of the baptism and a
[1:44:05] lot of people
[1:44:06] have read these scriptures and they have
[1:44:07] closed their bible and have moved on and
[1:44:09] they said okay this is the way it is
[1:44:12] amen and they miss christ they miss the
[1:44:15] word
[1:44:16] because their blindness to what they
[1:44:18] think is going to be amen
[1:44:20] just like we talked about israel was
[1:44:22] blinded
[1:44:24] god didn't come down and say okay i
[1:44:26] smite you blind no
[1:44:27] they were blinded because they were
[1:44:29] looking for them a different way
[1:44:31] they were looking at a different uh for
[1:44:34] a different
[1:44:35] in a different context or something how
[1:44:37] they look for jesus to come
[1:44:38] for their messiah to come they didn't
[1:44:41] look forward to coming on a manure pile
[1:44:44] they looked for him to come and say greg
[1:44:45] great circumstance where it was
[1:44:47] they looked at them and their eyes were
[1:44:49] blinded because they couldn't see past
[1:44:51] their own
[1:44:52] theology their eyes were blinded because
[1:44:56] they couldn't see
[1:44:57] past their own ideas oh friend
[1:45:01] we got to die to ourselves amen
[1:45:04] our ideas our opinions amen
[1:45:07] this is that great and dreadful day of
[1:45:09] the lord
[1:45:10] there had to be a prophet for this last
[1:45:13] day to restore
[1:45:15] to bring forth what was needed from the
[1:45:18] church ages to bring about
[1:45:20] in this last day through the inspiration
[1:45:22] revelation of the word
[1:45:24] a bride for a rapture a last day bribe
[1:45:28] right because the bible says that they
[1:45:31] are not complete without us
[1:45:34] amen they are not complete
[1:45:38] without us so where does that put us
[1:45:40] that puts us in the word for this last
[1:45:42] day
[1:45:42] in that restoration period now it's time
[1:45:45] that by faith for a body change
[1:45:48] revelation 11 is that fifth time
[1:45:50] you go to zechariah 2 and you see the
[1:45:52] two olive trees
[1:45:54] and talk about zechariah 2 the two olive
[1:45:56] trees are the same ones that come
[1:45:58] in revelation 11. those that are the
[1:46:00] olive tree referring to jews
[1:46:02] israel that was moses and elijah how do
[1:46:04] you know it's moses and elijah because
[1:46:06] the bible says
[1:46:07] shut up heaven and and did the miracles
[1:46:10] that moses and elijah did when they were
[1:46:12] here right
[1:46:13] amen the mystery i'm not completely sure
[1:46:18] about because i've read
[1:46:19] several quotes and brother branham
[1:46:21] actually says it two different ways
[1:46:23] where you would believe that he's saying
[1:46:25] it like they were the literal moses and
[1:46:28] elijah
[1:46:29] and then he says it in a way that it
[1:46:31] would lead you to believe that it was
[1:46:32] simply the anointing
[1:46:34] of those two men on two other prophets
[1:46:36] amen which
[1:46:37] i tend to believe right i tend to
[1:46:40] believe that part
[1:46:41] that that was not literally moses and
[1:46:44] elijah but that same
[1:46:45] anointing that's on those two prophets
[1:46:48] amen
[1:46:48] they also come in and they come in the
[1:46:50] scope of our message here
[1:46:52] uh with with the sixth rapture the third
[1:46:55] rapture of the new testament if you will
[1:46:57] amen so seeing that understanding
[1:47:01] that scripture by inspiration by
[1:47:04] revelation has to come or you'll
[1:47:08] never get it if it's not if that word
[1:47:11] doesn't come in by the holy spirit and
[1:47:13] speak back to you
[1:47:15] then you're not gonna it won't be there
[1:47:18] you won't get it
[1:47:19] amen it can't be it's got to be by
[1:47:22] revelation
[1:47:23] and you can see the word and it unfolds
[1:47:25] itself
[1:47:26] some people all they know is brother
[1:47:29] brown said brother branham said brother
[1:47:30] adam said that's all they know
[1:47:33] oh friend you mean to tell me that's all
[1:47:35] jesus
[1:47:36] is is what brother brown said amen
[1:47:40] amen thank you lord to me
[1:47:43] he's the living risen savior amen he's
[1:47:46] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:47:48] he was the one living in and through
[1:47:51] brother brown
[1:47:52] to bring this word to us and when god
[1:47:55] was finished with him
[1:47:56] he took him off the scene decreased
[1:48:00] so that christ and this bride would
[1:48:03] increase to this last day
[1:48:05] brother brown's not taking you in a
[1:48:06] rapture jesus christ
[1:48:09] amen praise the lord and that's who we
[1:48:12] have become
[1:48:14] in his word by him praise the lord amen
[1:48:18] let's stand if we could
[1:48:31] amen i hope maybe by the grace of god
[1:48:34] it uh that help today
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:41] and made a difference
[1:48:44] again not something that
[1:48:48] most of us don't know not trying to
[1:48:51] bring any new doctrines or any new
[1:48:52] revelations
[1:48:54] just to understand see i told you i even
[1:48:57] used the word understand
[1:49:00] for it to be revealed to us that we can
[1:49:03] see there
[1:49:04] or we why we believe what we believe
[1:49:08] right amen i i think a lot of the
[1:49:11] old-timers had to go off the scene and
[1:49:13] spend a lot of time with brother brown
[1:49:14] because
[1:49:15] all they saw and all they had was a god
[1:49:17] in brother brown
[1:49:19] and and and there there's so much more
[1:49:21] and understandably
[1:49:23] you know people make light and fun of
[1:49:26] you know baptizing his name and so
[1:49:28] on and so forth which i absolutely don't
[1:49:30] agree with either
[1:49:31] but you know brother brown said if if
[1:49:32] there weren't facets
[1:49:34] like that if there weren't people out
[1:49:36] there that that were like that i'd have
[1:49:37] to repent for my ministry
[1:49:39] right because his calling was to live so
[1:49:41] close to christ
[1:49:43] that people would mistake him for jesus
[1:49:45] yeah
[1:49:47] that just proves to me he fulfilled the
[1:49:50] call he was supposed to
[1:49:51] fulfill right and the purpose he was
[1:49:53] supposed to serve
[1:49:55] amen psalm 398 let's see this before we

[1:52:44] don't mean to be a negative person but
[1:52:47] it's
[1:52:48] not very bright outside
[1:52:52] it's a lot of darkness going on sir yeah
[1:52:55] amen
[1:52:55] as the spirit of christ we talked about
[1:52:58] lifting off the gentile bride well when
[1:53:00] the bride goes
[1:53:01] there's nothing there'll be nothing here
[1:53:02] but hatred and
[1:53:04] death and satan
[1:53:08] the only thing holding it back now those
[1:53:10] four winds those angels holding those
[1:53:12] four wins
[1:53:12] this bride when she just when she gets
[1:53:16] uh in that place abraham said to come to
[1:53:18] know who she is
[1:53:19] gone out of here friend then what's
[1:53:21] going to be left
[1:53:23] oh i if you see how bad it is now
[1:53:26] i don't want to be here then i don't
[1:53:29] want to be here then
[1:53:30] praise the lord god bless you love you
[1:53:32] appreciate each one of you pray
[1:53:34] something was said to bless and strength
[1:53:35] in some way today
[1:53:37] amen i wanted to give you a quick update
[1:53:41] sister julie uh let's start from the
[1:53:44] bottom up sister julie's niece
[1:53:46] maggie uh is now tested negative
[1:53:50] for code her sister is still in the
[1:53:53] hospital
[1:53:54] and she's doing okay but her oxygen
[1:53:56] levels are still a little low
[1:53:58] last time i talked to julie about her
[1:54:00] sister
[1:54:02] she's okay when she set sarah lays there
[1:54:04] and she can breathe when she gets up for
[1:54:06] something her oxygen level almost
[1:54:07] immediately drops
[1:54:09] and so they're keeping her in the
[1:54:10] hospital for right now unless
[1:54:12] something's changed
[1:54:14] julie herself tested positive
[1:54:17] she has a few mild cold symptoms and
[1:54:20] that's all i know of so far sounds a
[1:54:22] little bit like what she went through
[1:54:23] brother zach
[1:54:24] with it but her dad obviously of course
[1:54:27] the older man
[1:54:29] is having a struggle they had to put him
[1:54:31] in the icu they're putting him on heat
[1:54:33] infused
[1:54:33] oxygen which they say is helping
[1:54:36] the doctors are saying that that
[1:54:38] infusion is that
[1:54:39] i don't know i i think they don't want
[1:54:42] to do certain things to older people
[1:54:44] because they just
[1:54:44] don't care if they die because of money
[1:54:47] i mean
[1:54:48] they're not going to do a procedure on
[1:54:49] an old person that has a slim chance of
[1:54:51] living or not going to live that many
[1:54:53] years anyway afterwards
[1:54:54] spending this procedure on them when
[1:54:56] their insurance isn't going to pay for
[1:54:57] it or something and you know
[1:54:59] things obama but anyway um
[1:55:02] so he is in who is still in the icu
[1:55:06] and his oxygen level through the heat
[1:55:08] infused and oxygen
[1:55:09] his saturation level had come up to 90.
[1:55:12] so he was doing a lot better
[1:55:14] with that but his delirium is increasing
[1:55:18] uh brother uh sister julie said they
[1:55:21] asked him his name the other day and he
[1:55:22] said purple
[1:55:24] and he doesn't know where he is and
[1:55:27] things says
[1:55:28] the the delirium is getting worse so
[1:55:31] that was the real
[1:55:32] urgency of the prayer requests you put
[1:55:34] in uh
[1:55:35] please remember him in that option level
[1:55:38] is getting better but the other is
[1:55:40] getting worse
[1:55:41] but we're just trusting that whatever it
[1:55:44] is that's going on
[1:55:46] he's in god's hands god's in control in
[1:55:48] charge
[1:55:49] and it's all going to work the way the
[1:55:50] lord wants it and the man's going to be
[1:55:53] if it's his time to go he's going to be
[1:55:54] safe where he goes yes
[1:55:56] but i will tell you julie's other desire
[1:55:58] is that her dad would come home if he's
[1:56:00] going to go
[1:56:01] she would rather he'd be at home than
[1:56:03] the hospital
[1:56:05] i understand that i don't blame her for
[1:56:07] that
[1:56:08] so we'll see lord the lord can work
[1:56:11] miracles right
[1:56:12] amen because this isn't some that's not
[1:56:14] something they normally do if somebody
[1:56:15] still has symptoms or
[1:56:17] tests positive for copenhagen they're
[1:56:18] not going to send them home uh
[1:56:20] but the lord has a way of working it out
[1:56:22] perfect so please
[1:56:24] remember them in prayer uh you heard the
[1:56:27] request for brother dennis
[1:56:28] his back had been bothering him and he
[1:56:31] went uh to the podiatrist and he ended
[1:56:33] up taking
[1:56:33] two toenails out uh so you have to be on
[1:56:36] this
[1:56:37] off his feet for a little while brother
[1:56:39] zach can
[1:56:40] sympathize in that situation and
[1:56:43] uh and they found that little nodule
[1:56:45] next to his kidney so we wanted to pray
[1:56:47] that that is
[1:56:48] nothing benign whatever but
[1:56:52] the tests he just had on it were
[1:56:53] inconclusive
[1:56:55] so they're gonna they're wanting to
[1:56:56] probably do a pet scan or something to
[1:56:58] get a bigger a better view of what it is
[1:57:01] or biopsy or something so
[1:57:03] please pray for brother dennis we're
[1:57:04] just trusting that's nothing
[1:57:06] everything's gonna
[1:57:07] come out fine and uh you know how the
[1:57:09] devil would mess with your mind
[1:57:10] especially
[1:57:12] oh he messes with us all but you know
[1:57:14] brother dennis went through that little
[1:57:15] bout of
[1:57:16] the cancer and stuff and that devil and
[1:57:18] so you know how the devil will mess with
[1:57:20] your mind if you've already been there
[1:57:21] and you think oh there's a growth in
[1:57:23] there you know the devil
[1:57:24] how the devil does well just pray the
[1:57:28] lord will start sending dennis pennies
[1:57:29] again
[1:57:31] give that constant reminder the lord is
[1:57:33] with you all right we're right before it
[1:57:35] is with you
[1:57:36] and our prayers are with him so amen
[1:57:39] remember that prayer
[1:57:40] also uh i have not heard from the
[1:57:43] realtor of the other church building
[1:57:46] but strangely enough and i'm taking this
[1:57:49] as from the lord
[1:57:51] we went to the minister's meeting i
[1:57:53] drove down to uh
[1:57:54] orange grove and thornydale uh to catch
[1:57:57] brother
[1:57:58] river thornydale uh for my brother roger
[1:58:01] drove so i left my car in the parking
[1:58:03] lot there at the sprouts behind the
[1:58:04] freddies and
[1:58:05] you know where the car show is or was
[1:58:08] whatever they do now
[1:58:09] right there and i got back i had a flyer
[1:58:12] in my car door
[1:58:14] the flyer was for the church that we
[1:58:16] were going to take its place
[1:58:19] for that same church that same pastor
[1:58:22] and they're
[1:58:23] having special meetings in their new
[1:58:25] building
[1:58:27] so uh and they started today so
[1:58:31] i'm assuming they're out of that
[1:58:33] building i haven't heard from the other
[1:58:35] but i'm going to be getting a hold of
[1:58:37] him somehow tomorrow or his broker or
[1:58:39] something
[1:58:40] and find out what's going on with the
[1:58:41] other i'm just i'm just
[1:58:43] taking it from the lord i mean what are
[1:58:45] the odds of having my car there and
[1:58:47] having the fire put in
[1:58:48] and getting there to see it but it had
[1:58:51] on their suite 111 and that's the new
[1:58:53] place they were going to
[1:58:55] and they were starting today so the
[1:58:56] other place has got to be i'm assuming
[1:58:58] going to be vacant
[1:58:59] so anyway just keep praying and we'll
[1:59:03] just trust the lord and
[1:59:04] see where the lord takes it from there
