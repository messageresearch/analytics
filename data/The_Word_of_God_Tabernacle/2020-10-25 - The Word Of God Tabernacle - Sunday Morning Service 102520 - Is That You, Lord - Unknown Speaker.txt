trusted the lord and i'm going to say this for a year i've never heard of anyone that i've known personally that has suffered tremendously like she has and she thanks you and she knows that you're

wife uh sister tabitha she she has been going through a lot of tests and has had a lot of doctor's appointments the past month or two um the doctors don't really quite know what it is they have an idea of what it might be she's had blood tests done but pretty much she's just had and we mentioned it a few weeks ago i think too but like her lymph nodes are flaring up mostly on her neck and all over her body in different areas too but and she also feels you know just extreme pain some days just for no reason you know she'll be working possibly like the first or the day prior and then the next day she'll just feel horrible not doing anything you know too uh physically active but and then some days she didn't do anything the day before she just feels uh pain just everywhere uh to where she doesn't want to you know move or she can't she can't really move very well so uh i know the lord's able to touch her and hey man i'd ask if you can remember please yes does anyone have a testimony

anointing is here today i encourage you to reach out amen if you're at home or wherever you are we're here today i encourage you to reach out amen get a hold of that amen he's here he's here right now we're going to believe that amen praise the lord i'm i'm honestly i'm i'm trying to gather myself without having to run around this building to preach this and the lord gave me today it's uh it's all over me right now so amen turn in our bibles if we could um i'm just going to get started genesis chapter 38. amen genesis chapter 38 amen remind me i did have a couple of praise reports given by sister priscilla this morning that i forgot to mention i'll try to mention them to us if you please remind me i'll i'll try to make that known uh i want to wish brother angel a happy birthday sorry he's not feeling good today but yesterday was brother angel's birthday so happy birthday brother angel god bless you wish you were here with us you're in your family amen but a couple of uh praise reports i'll mention to you if the lord willing uh when we reach the end of the service today but so thankful of god's word amen amen and the blessings of the lord in our life now genesis chapter 38 i'm going to read one verse and i'll let you be seated but let's go to the 2 38th chapter of genesis the 26th verse and we'll just read this one verse and i'll let you be seated and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to sheila my son and he knew her again no more you could be seated if you like it was kind of tough trying to find one single verse out of this that i want to read to you today to draw this text uh it was kind of tough to find one verse and it basically strange that that's the verse that i chose in the verse that i read you think what would you come up with out of this verse but i want to go back to the third ver to the sixth verse same 38th chapter sixth verse uh and and read this little story it's not a story it's actually happening sometimes you say a story a story is i consider a story something that's told by somebody not necessarily true but we know this is not fiction this is actually something that happened to human beings like we're standing on the earth today and then the sixth verse uh of course we go back to judah of course you know that jesus was in the lineage of judah and satan tried to snuff out the lineage of jesus by snuffing out the lineage of judah way back here in genesis 38 so i want to read this and i'll explain to you the text that i have today and when the lord gave it to me from there but let's begin at the sixth verse and let's just read this if you would if you have never read it uh it's uh it's quite an interesting story but a thought came to me uh actually probably several years ago that i wrote a note down on paper i think actually i was driving i think it was when i started doing uber and lyft and i was listening to a tape and something struck me about this story and i wrote down a little note and it's been in my notebook and the other day i guess the lord inspired me to go back and look at that and so this is where this came from but genesis 38 verse 6 and judah took a wife for ur his firstborn whose name was tamar and ur judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up sea to thy brother and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother and the young and the thing which he did displease the lord wherefore he slew him also then said judah to tomorrow's daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy father's house till sheila my son be grown for he said lest for adventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her father's house and in process of time the daughter of shuna judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up into the sheepherders of tamnath he and his friend uh hira and uh the idolamite and it was told to march saying behold thy father-in-law goeth up to a timnath to shear his sheep and she went to her uh went and put on her she put her window garment off from her and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way of timnath for she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and he turned it unto her by the way and said go i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said i will give thee a kid from the flock and she said what will thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall i give thee she said thy signet thy bracelet and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him um let's just jump over to the 24th verse now just jump down to the 24th first and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tomorrow thy daughter-in-law had played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burned when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by by the man who these are am i the child am i with child and she was and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and the bracelet and the staff and judah acknowledged them and said she had been more righteous than i because i gave her not to sheila my son and he knew her again no more that's a very interesting story that judah of course took had had his sons uh uh his three sons and uh he found earth his first son a wife which is custom of course and the wife he found for him was tamar and er was evil in the sight of god so god killed her and then he went in to own it and said onan which was custom take your brother's wife tomorrow and raise seed to thy brother and onan did not want his seed to be the seed of his brother selfish prideful whatever it is so he decided that he would just spill his seed on the ground instead of giving it to his brothers what he considered his brother's wife which actually at that time was his wife but was raising seed as the custom of their tradition unto his brother who had died right so that displeased the lord and god killed him also right so my thought today and the text i want to take is is that you lord is that you lord think about this because that's a it's a genuine question for any christian sure you know well because we all go through things in life right but it struck me because with the thought that came to me again i said several years ago the thought that came unto me is judah is blaming his daughter-in-law for his son's dying when god is killing his sons because of their wickedness it wasn't tomorrow that was killing his sons he was killing god was taking judah's sons before he could even raise children of tamar to continue the lineage of judah right satan of course the wicked one taking these children out causing them to be wicked causing them to act this way is the reason the lord took them but it was for a supernatural thing that god would continue this lineage but judah's mind and judah's thinking was that it's tamar's fault that his sons are dying is tamar's fault maybe she's barren maybe she's not able to bring children and her son his sons are dying before she can bring forth children to replace him so judah is blaming tamar for this when god is the one orchestrating this not tomorrow this isn't tomorrow doing this god is taking took er because he was evil god took odin because he was wicked and because of that judah's thinking that it's her fault of course in a lot of times when things go wrong in our lives a lot a lot of the time we think about well whose fault is this who did this who do we blame we always want to find a scapegoat we always want to find something or somebody to blame and sometimes it's nobody's fault not even the devil maybe you know the devil gets blamed for a lot of stuff it ain't his fault right right we just do things we shouldn't do right or say things or make decisions we shouldn't do it sometimes we get ourselves in those situations and those are our fault right not somebody else but again it's always to pass the buck like we talked about in garden of eden but judah in his mind he's blaming someone it's not her fault it's not tomorrow's fault so in judah's mind he's thinking okay well sheila's of age now but i'm not going to give him to her because he'll die too and i'll be childless i want to have any more kids i won't have anybody else to raise seed unto my generation so he's thinking i'm not going to give him to her and it was their custom it was their tradition it was their law basically that he was to give sheila to tamar to raise up seed to his brothers but he transgressed the law and did not give sheila to her and because he didn't give sheila to her she was upset about it because she knew the tradition so somebody told her now in the meantime judah's wife dies and of course judah is lonely and so he goes into this city he sees a harlot so he wants to go into this harlot uh he's a lonely man so he wants to go into this harlot and of course it wasn't obviously then like it is today so um uh that uh so he goes in unto her she took off her widow's clothes and put on the widow the garments of a harlot and hit her face and he didn't know it was her right so he goes in unto her and he has his time and they uh uh come together and she conceives by judah right by that conception of her of his daughter-in-law she conceived judah's seed to continue the lineage of jesus christ now of course in the end it is tomorrow has twins and one of those twins of course continues you can read over in matthew the lineage of jesus christ one of those twins continues on with the lineage of jesus christ from the seed of judah because you know jesus is the lion of the tribe of judah right so it's that lineage that had to continue on so that that seed had to be planted in this righteous woman who judah had blamed for for his son's death but he didn't realize it was god doing it right how many times do things happen in our lives and we don't recognize this is you lord job said uh i i see him in the whirlwind i hear him in the in the fire and the thunder and the cracking and all the things that's going on but he passes by me just like a just like a a still small voice and i recognize him not right i don't see him god always has his hand in our life friend right we don't always recognize that it's him right but the question then becomes well is that you lord is that you i mean that would have been a great question for judah house before he just lays blame on tomorrow for his son's dying well lord is this you are you doing this is this your work are you the one uh bringing this to pass the way it is should i do this and and give sheila to tamar because that's what he should have done so once she is found with child the people come back to judah and said your daughter-in-law who you didn't give to sheila has now played the part of a and she's pregnant she's got a child and and judah says well let her be burned then and it's his child in her womb the chill turned out to be children but his child and her won but he didn't even know it and he said let her be burned she's done this she's played this part let her be burned and he was the one that refused to give sheila to her it was his fault that it happened that way it was from the beginning that's why when it comes here judah acknowledged that that that that signet and that staff and all was his right and he said oh my this is the this is what i gave to the woman that i went to bed with these are mine he acknowledged them he said yes these belong to me and this woman is more righteous than i am because i refused to give sheila to her i transgressed our tradition and law by not giving him to her right i'm the one that fought here i'm the one that made the mistake i'm the one that made the wrong type judgment i said this is god this uh this is uh a her that's causing this but it wasn't god was the one orchestrating this friend yes we have to remember we have to as children of god continue to realize that god is working everything not just every other thing or whatever he wants to he's working everything together for his perfect will and for our good amen which are the same right right what is good for us is what is god's perfect will and what is god's perfect will is what is good for us and he's working everything for our good he's working everything to fit his perfect will and those two things are the same right those two uh endings they're exactly the same objective that god's bringing them to both of them amen judah assumed it was tomorrow's fault it wasn't tomorrow's fault it wasn't her doing this right it was his children right now a couple of scriptures we'll go to romans chapter 11. romans chapter 11 verse 33 i want to read through this or try to get through this the lord help me i got a story i want to read to you for the message here at the end of it it's a little lengthy so just bear with me but i want to get to the place that we don't keep you too long but i want to get that story read too before we uh before we go now romans uh yeah romans chapter 11 verse 33 look now paul speaking of course of the romans oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god now who can acknowledge that amen amen how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out his ways are beyond our ways right his faults are beyond our thoughts his judgments are unsearchable his ways past finding out how many things happen how many things are going on today i can't tell you i i guess if i sit down i probably could but i at this moment standing here i can't tell you how many times people have called me or text me questioning not understanding what's going on with the coven thing right i said don't worry about that uh well why did so-and-so get it i don't know well why did so-and-so die from it i don't know i just know that as a child of god you have to trust god is working it all for his glory for his honor and for our good right whatever it does right yes that's all i can tell you i i don't know and yeah it can become confusing to say well why this and why that and we are a people especially in the day that we live and the society has caused us all to uh to be more active in the laodicea spirit which is my rights and me and all about me and and and all that you know which actually if you're a child of god you're a sheep and you have no rights you've relinquished your rights to the shepherd and we are just sheep that follow the shepherd we are led by his spirit we do what he tells us his thoughts we want his thoughts to be our thoughts right we want his ways to be our ways well if his thoughts are my thoughts and my thoughts go inside if he waits are my ways and my ways go to the side i don't want my way i want his way amen and see everybody well why did this happen why did that happen and we we continue with that why question but we don't know why you might not ever know why right and why is it it will be a proverbial question uh in humans minds throughout as long as there is history but the fact remains that god is working all this together and the question can be lord then is that you are you the one doing this are you the one causing this to happen are you the one bringing this to pass is this your will is this what you want from me right now is this where you put me is this why i've done this right and people don't understand well i just can't see why well don't worry about why just say lord if it's your will then let it be amen but we we pray we bring prayer requests we trust the lord it was a lot of prayer requests today a lot of needs a lot of situations sick people and and and and things happening but but we trust and believe that there's a reason god does that amen and it's all for his glory and honor and we want it to be nothing to us but all to him it's all to his glory and honor but his ways his judgments are unsearchable well god judged that this is to be that way well i don't want it to be that way well then you're not a christian i don't want it to be like that well paul even said the things that happened to us are grievous at the time they're hard to understand and and just like he told here it's beyond our knowing his ways are past us even finding out amen it's above all that we could ever ask or what think there's things that he does for us that's succeeding abundant above anything that we can even think right well if we can't even think that high then how could we even begin to fathom that we can that we can understand the mind of god right you just can't do it god's working the work in judah's life because god wants to bring about a righteous ending or continuing of the lineage of jesus christ and it wasn't going to come through a wicked er or a wicked odon right that's why god had judah come into tamar and skip that generation to bring in that lint to continue that lineage and he used tamar to do it that's why judah said she's more righteous than i am right not realizing but the knowledge of god the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments his ways past finding out for who had known the mind of the lord or who had been his counselor right a lot of people sure think they are right a lot of people act like they want to be but nobody comes close to even emulating what jesus does must let's be his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen amen so it comes to the point saints that we realize god is if we're christians if we're children of god that god is working this together for our good right yes however he's doing it i may not understand it it may not make any sense may not have been the way i would do it in fact it probably wouldn't have been most of the thing the things the lord's done in my life most of the time it's been as the lord wanted i wouldn't have done it like that right but he does it that way for a reason he brings it about that way for a reason why did god send moses down to egypt and then harden the pharaohs hard against him i mean you think about god you're sending me someplace so he's going to lay out the red carpet he's going to throw the beautiful roses and flowers and and the trumpets are going to blow and the banners are going to wave and i'm going to get the welcome of my life yeah you're gonna get the welcome of your life all right that ain't gonna be the way you think right amen no red carpet no flowers no banners no trumpets no sound of salute it's all about hardness he hardened pharaoh's heart against him and every and most of the time our thoughts are oh wow god asked me to do this this is just going to be a breeze don't you think for a second that god won't allow the devil to come and trip you on every single chance he gets right god wants to test and make sure that we know god this is you right you did this you sent me here you called me to do this you're the one who orchestrated this you're the one who moved in my life you spoke to me and told me whether you believe it or not am i well it must not have been the lord or it wouldn't have been all this upset you know if there's a lot of upset that probably means it's god amen amen that probably means more the best evidence that it probably is god amen because the devil's going to fight at every chance but remember when god when moses went to egypt the bible says god hardened pharaoh's heart against him god did that my and then along the line pharaoh's heart would get softened and then god would just harden it right back up again pharaoh's heart would get softened and his people would come and scream and yell and he'd say oh okay you couldn't and god would just harden it right back up again right amen hard to understand but look how god we in retrospect we can look back hindsight's 20 20 right we can always look back and say well we can see how this worked and how god orchestrated it but when you're in the middle of it friend it doesn't look like that amen it doesn't feel like that it doesn't seem that this is gonna be what god's gonna work to be his glory and honor and that all of us are gonna benefit from it it doesn't look that way because his ways are way beyond us finding out his ways are far beyond what we can comprehend yes the the way god does things transcends things that we could even think how many times has god's done something in your life in in retrospect you look back and you believe and understand that was the hand of god but you realize at the time or you think back at the time you didn't know that was god right you didn't realize that was the hand of the lord doing that yes you didn't understand this was god's moving in your life and bringing this to passing this to passing this to pass and you may not have understood and we don't understand a lot of times the consequences we suffer from things that we do that we're not supposed to do [Music] that happens too amen these consequences sometimes that are there that we don't realize that that that's god too right because god is making that work together for our good it's like a a parent and a child when a child does something or transgress the parents instructions then that child has to suffer the consequences right amen the child might administer it uh the the parent might administer it or it might just become a result of what their life is now like now you look at parent neglect today i don't know why we ended up getting on children parents last week too you look at parents today and you look at children and you think well if there's parent neglect which brother branham talked about today it's not child delinquency it's parent delinquency you look at parent delinquency today and you can see how people are are out in the world today and you think wonder what kind of home they came from right wonder what caused them to be like that they probably transgressed along the line and there was no repercussion there was no punishment right they'd done something wrong with no punishment well if you do something wrong with no punishment you think oh i got away with it what you do something worse the next time right right and if you get away with it if the parent doesn't take care of it and doesn't handle it when they're children then they grow up to be reprobates right the end of killing people robbing jail whatever right and that's what happens parent delinquency that's where it is where it is today brother branham said that 40 years ago apparent delinquency let's go to isaiah chapter 55. isaiah chapter 55 as soon as you get away from god and get away from everything that's right you get rid of everything that works properly doesn't look like it at the time but you see the fruits of that that manifests itself later down the line and the fruits that manifest itself sometimes is a worse punishment than if god had just whooped this one good time what happened you know or just like a parent you think the punishment down the line of what the results are are far worse if you just spank that child to start with right yes now i'm not you know some people uh beat their kids i don't agree with that either but i do agree with the bible and the rod and the respect and and displaying children that's just the way we raise our children we believe the bible says right with love and respect you've got to remember yes uh one thing billy paul i heard in his testimony years ago he said that his his little boy come around and interrupted him and brother branham and he said go off and play and they told him two or three times he came two or three times and and about the third or fourth time billy paul got so mad at his son he just whacked him on the bottom one time scoot him a couple foot across the floor and he went off crying and he said okay daddy let's get back and brother brown says no he said well what's the matter he said you just struck that child he says you're just you're telling me i just disciplined my child he said no you struck that child in anger right he said and that angel is displeased with what you did but you strike him in anger you beat him let's just say it that way you struck him in anger you're not to strike him in anger correction's a different thing right he had to make that right right then and there you know i i guess it was fun living with your daddy as a prophet right but anyway he said he had to make that right right then you know because he displeased the lord when he did that he displeased that angel he displeased that displeased the lord he said and he had to make it right he had to get before they could continue on with their correspondence and their writing back he had to make that right because they had to get the atmosphere back right again right amen right isaiah 55 verse 6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god and he will abundantly pardon praise the lord that's god god of mercy for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts we know the song oh i can remember i could hear of course brother branham said it many times but of course more recently i can hear brother green rings in my mind the lord works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and uh that that's a 300 year old song but it's still true today amen the lord does work in mysterious ways his wonder to perform what is that mysterious ways well we can go and look especially in the new testament at all the references to mysteries and things hidden from covered up from generations and ages god continually unfolding himself first was a mystery and then revealed it continues to remain a mystery unless god does reveal it but he does work in mysterious ways what is a mystery something you don't know or understand right we may not know it or understand it his ways his faults are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways god said that heavens are higher than the earth so my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts and your thoughts that's why philippians says let the mind of christ be in you right amen let that mind that was in christ be in you amen so that we can understand and see through the word how how to live our lives how to be pleasing to the lord right i think i told you one time i had a guy in the car and uh he claimed to be a christian but he was very smart kid so he's you know kind of he followed god with his intellect and we were talking about being pleasing to god and that kind of thing i forget exactly how it got to that point and i said well how do you know how to please the lord well i just do whatever you know i think that that is right i said well how do you know what is right he said well the things that are socially normal i said how do you know the social is is right how do you know that our society is right how do you know that what society is doing and living and how they go how do you know that any of that is right and he got to the place he just couldn't answer me and i said the only way we can know is through god's holy word through the bible the bible's the only way we can know what is pleasing to god we don't do what is pleasing to god by doing what we think is right we do what the word says is right we do what the word tells us is right if we live by the dictates of this scripture then we will be pleasing to the lord that's the bottom line of it he is because his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts higher than our thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven returneth not thither but water at the earth and make it that bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be to be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto i sent it amen praise the lord amen the word of the lord comes out is going to return the way that god sent it for the purpose that god meant for it to to cause and to bring about is going to happen satan no matter how hard he tries to stop it he can't do it right because the word of the lord says as he speaks it it will perform itself amen that word will not return void it will accomplish what he sent it forth for so if that word comes through god's bible if that word comes through your lips if it's god speaking he will accomplish what he said he would do period there's not enough devils in hell can stop it amen it will accomplish what god said it would for you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains the hills shall break forth before you into singing hallelujah all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn instead of the thorns shall come up the fir tree and instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen praise the lord what is that that means that when god does it when you ask for a a bread he doesn't give you a stone right amen right when you when you speak something and the word goes forth it accomplishes that when go you desire something from the lord the lord doesn't just send you down and give you something that's uh that that's you won't want to uh something nice and god gives you a thorn or a briar right he sends forth that that's beautiful that that's pleasant amen that is going to prosper and prosper you amen and that's why we should say sometimes is that your lord are you working that is this you doing this yes is this you causing this to be to happen the way it is and i'm talking about specific things i'm talking about very specific things sometimes just like judah with his sons dying did he just took a moment and said lord is this you god might have spoke to him and said yes your sons are evil and she would give sheila to tomorrow but god's working it all yes because the other thing we have to understand that god know what god knew what judah's reaction was going to be god knew what judah was going to think god knew what judah was going to do right he knows what you're going to think he knows what you are going to do that's why he orchestrates it and turns it around and makes it work to where it's going to work out right because we can come and say well this is supposed to be like this and somebody come and say no it's not going to be like that well you know god's got another plan for that to happen the way he wants it to because god has an end result and the end result is what god's looking for not the middle the middle of the road is just a facilitator god's looking for the end result god starts here and he's looking for this to happen and whatever god does in between here is up to him man can try to stop what god's trying to do but god's going to continually move on with his plan and it's going to have the result that god intended it to have period no matter what the devil can do no matter how long he can hold back prayers like he like daniel amen the angel come to daniel said that those those demonic spirits have been hindering us from 21 days to get to you dan you know he said that's okay right god took care of me yes god heard my prayer i knew god heard my prayer but you didn't hear from him but i knew he heard me great amen but i didn't hear his voice i didn't feel his spirit but i knew he heard me amen you got to know it's faith amen god hears us amen god understands amen god understands let's look back at another couple of situations here let's go to matthew chapter 1. matthew chapter 1 a very prominent situation that took place and how would you react now this one came forth in a different way but same situation when it first unfolded matthew chapter one verse uh see verse 18. now the birth of jesus christ christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost now we read the bible today and the bible tells us that mary was pregnant of the holy ghost we can see that well he said well praise the lord that's the deliverer amen we believe that but if you're standing there at that time when that event is unfolding what do you think oh my she's pregnant already her and joseph hadn't even come together it'd be like tomorrow it'd be like jo judah's uh accusation to tomorrow was she she played the part of a harlot she's she's pregnant she hadn't even come to her husband yet they're already betrothed and she's pregnant when you're sitting there and you're a part of the event that's happening this is real life right when you're sitting here today in october 2020 and events come up and you think oh my well how could this why would this how could this was that you lord are you doing something are you orchestrating some this even looked demonically wicked horrible this looked very bad this wasn't just uh you know somebody slipping out a word they shouldn't say that this this is a this is a bad situation if this was evolving as it was in the garden of eden it was it was just as vile as it was then right but see that wasn't the situation if you just stop as i've read this and and take away the fact that we know now it was jesus christ and of the holy ghost and you just see a woman and she's pregnant i see they called jesus an illegitimate child brother brahma said they did that's not in the bible you can't read it in most places you can see the inference that when many of the pharisees and religious leaders come forth you can hear the inference that jesus was illegitimate but it's not in the bible exactly like that brother branham said they believed he was illegitimate child and i'm sure they probably did believe he was an illegitimate child even though their own torah their own holy book told them a virgin was going to conceive all they had to do is go back in isaiah and try to match up the word with the event and see that the event that was taken was a fulfillment of a prophecy that a virgin would conceive that's all they had to do but you know that's not the first thing most of the time that people think about right first thing that people think about is the worst it's got to be the worst oh she had to have done something with somebody she had to have made a mistake she had to have slipped up with a guy or something that's the first thing most people think right admit it you know it's the truth most of us if not all of us at some point when something like that happens or you hear something the first thing you think is the worst right that's mostly what happens especially if it's somebody that's close to you or somebody you love or something it's just the way it is it's human thinking that's why we have to get beyond that right lord are you doing this is there a reason you're allowing this yes well this event didn't happen very very long because joseph 19th verse then a man a just man not willing to make her a public example was going to put her away he was getting and that was the right thing to do but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the holy ghost this is god's doing joseph where am i god is doing this if your question is is this you lord the answer is yes god is doing this yes she's conceived but that conception is a fulfillment of isaiah 9 and that this woman is still a virtuous woman that's going to conceive and bring forth jesus christ the savior of the world amen and they call him an illegitimate child why because all they could see was the natural right all they could see was the physical all they could see was this what was there tickling their senses a cta spill smelling here oh friend don't miss god because of your intellect don't miss god because of your senses don't miss god because it's not something you can understand right let god minister to that let god speak to you now maybe it is demonic maybe it is of the devil we don't know but don't just dismiss it don't miss god because of it god this may be you doing this now god came to joseph and told him specifically joseph don't you do this now this this is of the holy ghost this is god doing this this is god's working now don't you get rid of her she's still your wife she's going to be your wife but now what do you think in all of this that god is working and telling joseph this that all the other people around them are thinking especially the religious leaders and the righteous ones those that are in high authority positions in the pharisees and sadducees and and holy righteous men yes what do you think they're thinking right what do you think their conversation is to other people oh don't have nothing to do with them oh don't say anything to them don't you better stay away from them don't have anything to do with that person oh they're ill-famed oh they're they're they're demons all day they're horrible people oh friend and people do that and ruin other people's lives who's guilty for that now you are amen amen you are and god is the one orchestrating the whole time god is the one doing it the whole time oh have mercy help us lord yes yes i mean friend i i told you a story about my sister and and i will tell you it wasn't right what she did right but my sister married a man and and he was a horrible guy i knew that when i was young just a horrible guy i don't think the marriage lasted but a month or two or something didn't last long my sister ended up living with her husband who was still her husband become her ex-husband living with his sister his sister was going to a message church and in the message and some of their family was some of their family wasn't you know how that is so some of the family was so he went she went to live with his sister and she started taking her to this message church and the lord moved on her heart and she came to my dad with this message was that god's way of getting us in the truth well that's the way it worked out amen right that's the way it worked out a broken marriage like that and living with her because she was too ashamed to come back home so to go live she went to live with his sister got in the message that spoke to my dad my she finally convinced my dad we went to church my dad came home and said this is what i've been looking for my whole life been in it ever since you may say that's wrong it may be but it was god doing it right that's my opinion i believe it yeah god's the one that did that you think well that she shouldn't have done that you know she's been married divorced blah blah blah you know what people can be so self-righteous and so uh uh high and mighty and and so legalistic that they don't give anybody a little bit of grace except themselves right they're not willing to give anybody else a little bit of grace to say you know maybe god did this yes maybe there's a reason god allowed this to happen maybe god orchestrated this because he has a greater plan his ways are beyond our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts yes we can't understand it sometimes but god works it for a reason yes and it's going to accomplish what he sent it forth for it's going to do exactly what god wanted it to do even if a virgin is standing here and she's with child and they don't understand it oh an illegitimate child why would joseph even stay with her right because this was god doing it am i right now who's responsible for all of the things that was said against her in him who's responsible for turning other people against them who's responsible for ruining their lives to the point where they didn't ruin it you know what i'm saying in society and things like that who is the one those are the people that's going to be held accountable friends i don't want to be one of those people either help me lord yes that would conceive the herds of the holy ghost she shall bring forth the son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall uh shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and thou shalt and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us when joseph being raised we'll just skip on from there let's go over to uh another scripture acts acts chapter five i almost said this just now but a very wise man yeah he's a pharisee but he's a very wise man name was gamalia the man that paul saw taught at or learned at the feet of gamalia but one of the greatest statements in the bible let's start with the 34th verse acts chapter 5 verse 34 is in this one of the greatest is right is right one of the greatest pieces of advice let me just put it that way let's read it you probably know it but let's read it to to to try to wrap this up then stood there one of one of them in one in the council a pharisee named gamalio a doctor of the law had a reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space and he said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what he intend to do as touching these men now they were they had uh captured them and they had imprisoned them and beat them and everything and gamalia's warning them now he's warning the religious leaders the pharisees right be careful what you do to these men for before these days rose up uh theaters boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves so look at this i i feel rushed let's go back a minute i'm going to slow down let's read this gemelli is telling them to be careful how they handle these men okay that's the first point be careful what you do to these men be careful as you touching these men how you handle this situation and look at his reasoning he said before these days before now theodus boasting himself to be somebody oh lord amen look at all that around the world today people out there ministers boasting themselves to be something and most of the time something they're not to whom a number of men look now theaters is boasting himself to be somebody and a number of men about 400 of them joined themselves to him who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to naught so you see these things out here happening friend don't go well i wonder how this could happen i wonder why this would be i wonder how people can follow them just remember that's scriptural very much right gamalia's reminding them us today that theaters was the same way he had 400 people in his congregation and of course because it wasn't of god he fell what did flat say right uh he was slain and all those that were following him or obeyed him were scattered and that work was brought to nothing right amen so don't worry about it you're on tv or you see a tbn or whatever you hear about these great ministers or those that boast themselves whatever maybe even in the message boast themselves to be something that they're not and people following them don't worry god's got it under control he said lord is that you right amen well this shouldn't be like that how do you know maybe it is supposed to be like that right maybe god's got something he's working to bring it around to whatever he wants to accomplish on the end right right let it alone yes that's what gamalia is saying let it alone because you see this work and what happened here and it wasn't of god the man died and they all scattered and it came to nothing so don't worry about it right amen god's got his hand on what he's doing great advice right great advice yes after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of texting he drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed so gamalia is giving examples if it's not of god it's not going to come to amount to anything anyway that's right don't worry about it it's not worth your time it's not worth your effort you can pray for them oh friend can i encourage you today let's pray for them those are souls yes those people scattered about not a pastor those are souls those people are if this happens those people are going to be hurting those people are going to be need because of this but the truth of it is it's not going to come to anything god's going to take care of it and if his people are there he's going to pull them out amen because if they're his and they're in a place they're not supposed to be god's going to take care of that right you just let god take care of them now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel of this work be of men it will come to not but but if it is of god ye cannot overthrow it and you will be finding yourself fighting against god amen amen now talk about some of the good advice right especially spoken to the ears of the men that were frothingly hot and mad and ready to beat these men and even kill them for what they were doing but he said look we are men of god we consider ourselves men of god right and if this is not of god it's going to be like those others it's going to go away it's going to disappear it's going to come to nothing but if it's god is that you lord yes if it is god you're going to find yourself fighting against god if you're fighting these men you're fighting those men and those men are sent by god you're going to be finding yourself fighting against god now that's where a lot of people get in trouble today because they sit there and they say well how can that be of god well who are you to say amen amen amen there's probably i'm gonna say something i don't know why but i'm gonna say it there's probably people in this city that think this right here is not of god right but i'm here to tell you today and you're sitting here in these pews you know what it is you know this is the work of god right yeah no i'm not saying it's the only one right amen but did you know this is the work of god yeah i know it is yeah and when i feel the presence of god so strong like that again this morning i just say thank you lord yes amen amen thank you lord amen but if it's not a god come to nothing but don't fight against it friend because you might be fighting against god got to be careful amen jesus uh the bible says romans says uh that he have mercy on who he'll have mercy he'll have compassion on you compassion whatever god does that's up to him he's sovereign he does this he will one more scripture i want to read real quick and we'll get to we'll get to my story here acts chapter 15 not too far down now um over acts chapter 15 verse 36 acts chapter 15 verse 36 now paul and barnabas had a very successful ministry together and the book of action noticed most of the time when they went out they went out by twos two men went this way two men went this way and how they did they mostly went by twos and paul and barnabas you can read through acts had a very successful ministry together but there come a time where i say you look in the bible i say that these men needed to go about their own businesses in their own ways and god orchestrating them both right now do you believe that if god could have a tremendously successful ministry with paul and barnabas that he could not have as equally or more so successful ministry in paul and in barnabas well sure he could yes he used both men equally wherever they were just like he used them both together right and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brother and in every city where we have preached the word of the lord see how they do barnabas determined that you know bart is probably thinking that's a great idea paul let's let's do that let's take with them uh let's take with us john whose surname is mark but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed them from pamphilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed into cyprus paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god and he went through syria and sisliya confirming the churches now from that time their contention you think oh well we're brothers we we love one another absolutely i don't think the love between paul and barnabas changed but they got such a contention between them and you know what david said brings contention you know what psalm says brings contention pride right pride bringeth contention right but there was such a contention between these two men they had to split right you think oh my what a successful ministry for jesus christ and now it's all ruined no no no no is this you lord god say yeah because i want him to go over here and i want him to go over here why i don't know right spread the gospel more you can you can go to two places instead of one right you can get two groups of people instead of one but it may be a lot more to it than just that i don't know why maybe barnabas was decided to go somewhere with this man that they would have been more successful in preaching to that group than paul would have right or silas or silas needed to be with paul to go over here to do this to get in jail we don't know but what we do know is god's orchestrating this to bring about whatever the purpose that he has for it to happen is that you lord is is this the way it is because you brought it to be that way yes amen yes friend i have never guessed i'd have never believed in a billion years that we would be sitting in this little building here on country club this morning having church never would never would but god has a reason for everything yes and the best thing that we can do lord is that you are you the one doing this sometimes it's hard sometimes it's very deep struggle sometimes it takes friends from you right acquaintances from you sometimes it takes away everything from you that was familiar to you yes he jerks out that comfort zone like that eagle stirring the nest sometimes god wants to reach we get a little comfortable god wants to reach in and grab a big hunk of rabbit skin and throw it out so the next time you sit down you don't sit down a nice comfy rabbit skin you're sitting down on a big briar not so comfortable anymore right time to move this is not the way i remember it time to do something different there you go well that's good i finally got your attention now i can lead you where i want you to go right amen let me read this tom's getting away from me uh this story now brother brown tells this story two or three different places i like this one this was in 1957 january when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes its place so please bear with me a moment it's kind of long i'll try to read it through he said that morning i was teaching the boys turned out to be leo and gene i was teaching the boys on love now closely before closing i looked coming down the road and i seen a little object rolling and tumbling as it came down the road and i looked and it was about i suppose 10 o'clock in the day boys and what it was it was a possum you know what possums are up here now anyone who knows wildlife knows that possums travel at nighttime they're blind in the day so here uh was this possum traveling in the daytime and he come down here where there was no fences two or three houses coming from the woods about 500 yards across the highway here he come up the lane and my house is fenced with a rocked gate and when the opossum got even with my house he turned and came in and i looked and i said there's a possum something has happened it's got rabies maybe it looked how it was acting tumbling rolling fighting trying to get in mr wood which was his next-door neighbor banks woods if you didn't know that he lived next door to brother brown mr wood had been raking in the yard and had a rake laying there and i said to the boys come out here just a moment and i run and got the rake and threw it over the possum and at the time the milkman came up mr gilmore we were looking at the possum and i said it must have rabies oh i said no i said no and look oh excuse this he said but maggots was all over its leg blow flies dog must have chewed it or it got run over by a car and mashed to pieces oh i said look how it is swollen up the great big leg is uh bigger than the other one and i said it's dying while i was holding the rake over the possum to my surprise a possum and a kangaroo is the only animals that pack their babies in a pocket and her pocket let out and she had nine little tiny naked babies and i said come here boys i'll teach you some more out of the bible i said perhaps the possum come in the day before there had been a very fine a very very fine beautiful young looking lady of our city that had a baby and she wrapped it in a blanket smothered it to death took it in a taxi and dropped it in the river and we were talking about that so i said that lovely young lady wasn't nothing like the mother that this possum is not because she was uh this girl but they they all do the same all women i guess he's referring to all do the same without christ but i said the morals of this possum is better than the morals of that woman for that woman didn't want her baby and took its life the police had her in jail but i said this old mother possum uh hasn't got over 30 minutes to live she was biting the rape for she couldn't do usually when you touch them they uh they call they they do what you call play possum you ever seen a possum play possum that's dead they play dead if they feel threatened the possum will roll over and act like it's dead falls but she was making her way somewhere and uh and i said she is fighting the rake and she's so frantic but she's a real mother she'll give this last 30 minutes of her life fighting for her babies i said that's a mother's love she loved her babies i raised up the rake and went on uh the possum rolling and it went right up to my door and there she fell at his door exhausted i said she's dead i went up there punched her with a rake but i seen she wasn't dead she still got a little grin on the side of her face she ever seen a possum they had that grin they they grin that goes up the side of their mouth right kind of weird if you've never seen it it's really unusual how opossum does grin like a possum that's kind of a southern expression they say grin like a possum that's what it means anyway and i punched her to the right she had that little grin on the side and i looked at the leg laying there all sprawled out the little babies nursing on that poor dying mother mr ms woods come up miss wood which is a sweet christian woman in terms of what she knows she's a veterinarian said brother brown kill the possum and get it out of its misery said the little ones has a round round mouth and they cannot take a bottle and they're too young anyhow they're just a few hours old so you'll have to take the little ones and kill them oh i thought i can't do that i said i just can't oh she said brother branham you're not going to let that poor thing lay there like that the little possums nursing that milk from that dead mother they'll all die a horrible death now the woman was right but something in me wouldn't let it happen she said why you're a hunter go get your gun and shoot her he said i'm a hunter but i'm not a killer right i said but i can't do it she said let bank sin let her beloved husband he was my buddy said let him kill her i said i can't said do you mean you're going to let that poor animal lay in that hot sun and those little ones squirts their little naked bodies get that direct raise of the sun today laying there groaning suffering like that dying it looked like the humane thing to do but i just couldn't do it i talked to leo and gene later on they left all through that day she laid there a little possum still nursing that night mr wood come up and said now brother branham you've been busy all day you've just got to leave everything alone come in i'm taking you for a little ride and uh we got the wife and we went out and went riding i found a little old dog laying on the side of the road mangy eating uh flea bitten i picked him up all the fleas filling all over my hands reminds me of those cats we got for mike and tafta that time had so many cats you look at their belly and the fleas is just running everywhere in florida i thought let's see where we are riding along he said the fleas running all over my hand and my wife said billy you're not going uh you're not going to take that i said but honey he's just a little fella somebody's dropped him off because he's all mangy i said he's got a right to live too and i took him and i took him home washed him up doused him up prayed for him and he's a fine big cauli dog today when i went back in about 11 o'clock they're laid uh uh they're laid the old possums sprawled out brother wood said well now she's gone and the little one's still nursing i said well maybe she is said why don't you kill her billy i said i just can't so my boy come around about midnight from the river fishing and there laid the old opossum still laying there all night i thought of that possum i just couldn't get it off of my mind the next morning early i rose up you know brother adams or at least four o'clock or so got up early the next morning i got up went outside and when i went outside there laid the old possum mr wood said to me that night you know brother branham if that possum was ever going to move it would move when the sun went down said you're trapped and hunted enough you know that's right the next morning i went out and i've got a little girl saw her first vision just recently a little 11 year old girl she come out on the porch little rebecca she looked over at that and she started to cry she said daddy she's a real mother isn't she i said yes yes i kicked her with my foot and she had do all over her blow fries uh blow flies still on her said daddy what are you going to do with that mother possum i said honey daddy don't know she said you going to kill her daddy i said daddy can't do it honey i said sweetheart you're up too early just go little pajamas on just go in the bedroom with your mommy so i heard her off in the room and i went down in the den room and sat down and i thought oh god how that poor old mother possum has suffered how she must love those babies and i sat there and i thought well i'll hope i don't have to kill her and as i was sitting there something said to me you were preaching yesterday about her you used her as your text i said that's right you said she was a real mother i said that's right said i sent her to your door and she's laying at your door like that for 24 hours waiting for you waiting for her turn for you to pray for her and you've never said a word my he said god said i sent that possum to your door for her to pray for you and she's laid there like a faithful mother for 24 hours waiting her turn for you to pray for her and you never said a word i said well i didn't i said who am i talking to am i talking to myself i jumped up i thought oh is that you god amen right is that you god most people wouldn't have thought everybody that came around there killing billy killer it's the right thing to do you know it's a humane thing to do it's only right some in him says no i just can't do it i can't kill her it's just something in me i just can't kill her god finally gets up early in the morning god finally speaks to him and says i sent that possum to you i specifically sent that possum to your front door and she's laid there for 24 hours waiting her turn for you to pray for her and you've never done it right he said is that you lord is that you god i walked out on the porch little rebecca standing there looking at the mother opossum yet she comes by it from the house i went out to the apostle and i said god i know that you know every flower you know every sparrow and being that great that this great horrible thing has happened to womanhood this beautiful young girl who killed her baby you wanted to show me that you can even lead the animals she come up and laid at my gate waiting for her turn to be prayed for i said i am sorry god and i did that i said i didn't know it god i have done it i would have done it but i said if it be your divine prophets you had sought this and want me to pray for this possum this i do in christ's name help her father it's her love for her babies it's been so great i thought oh god what uh what would you do this now it may seem strange this went over letters from africa india all over the world about it associated press i think caught it that old mother raised up picked her little ones in her pocket walked down the lane just as normal as any other possum could walk rat tail hooked up in the air got down to the gate turned around as if to say thank you sir and across the road she went out into the woods and as far as i know happy with her babies tonight amen amen didn't that something even brother brown you know there's a lot of people that think oh brother branham knew everything god was doing everything god was every move god was making brother branham knew about it but there god sent him a possum and he didn't even know right right he even went out on a ride and got a dog that was all manged and didn't think anything about it he said he prayed for the dog and he dipped it and he took care of it and it was a beautiful dog never even dawned on him that god would send him a possum he told his old wife this dog has a right as much a right to live as anybody this possum has a right just as much as anybody amen and i sent him to your door what a lesson friend yes what a lesson we can take to realize god doesn't just move in the things that we think is normal or or right god sent that possum all the way down the street all the way passing all those houses had come down into his house it was fenced down the driveway laid in his front door just for him to pray for her and as soon as he prayed for us she got up got her babies and walked down thank you sir and just went into the woods and take care of life like this amen amen right how many of us would have been in that position how many of us would have thought oh god sent that possum to me brother branham didn't even know for a man but god sent that to him for that and brother branham is that you lord right yeah it was god he was god the whole time sometimes it's god and especially if you think you don't understand something it probably is god god taking care of it god orchestrating god making it work together and see it wasn't just a possum that was a lesson that was something that taught god taught a lesson to brother branham for that he taught i taught me a lesson when i read it probably taught us a lesson here today amen is that you lord yes god is lord let's find ourselves to have enough grace to recognize that hey maybe this is god doing this maybe this is god taking care of this maybe this is the moving of the lord doing this and because i i can't fret or worry about it because no matter whether it is or isn't god's
