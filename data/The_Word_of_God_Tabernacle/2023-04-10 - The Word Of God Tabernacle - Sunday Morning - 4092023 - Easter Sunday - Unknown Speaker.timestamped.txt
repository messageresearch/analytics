[28:17] he sent himself back to live in a mini
[28:19] member body it's not just him now it is
[28:23] him but it's him and all of us
[28:26] God Amen it reminds me of a a thing that
[28:31] happened one time in in Saint Augustine
[28:34] is these big banana spiders Micah knows
[28:37] him think they're huge legs and all
[28:39] they're they're that big they fall off
[28:41] the tree she can't exterminate them
[28:43] because they fall off the trees and
[28:44] getting on the house and they get in the
[28:46] house and and they lay eggs and they put
[28:48] these they have these big sacks and uh
[28:51] there's this one person and they had one
[28:54] spider in their house that they could
[28:55] find just one is a big one they didn't
[28:58] realize that underneath that spider it
[29:01] was a mama underneath that spider was
[29:03] that egg sack about that face
[29:06] and they looked at that one spider and
[29:08] they thought I'm gonna kill that one
[29:09] spider and it'll end it all
[29:11] and she grabbed that newspaper or
[29:13] whatever it was I forgot now this is a
[29:15] true story
[29:16] grabbed and smacked that spider and
[29:18] killed the spider but when she did she
[29:21] shot 200 little spiders all over her
[29:23] house
[29:26] reminds me of Satan he said if I just
[29:28] get a hold of him I'm gonna kill him and
[29:31] that'll be the end of it all but when he
[29:33] did he created multi millions of people
[29:36] around the world since then that have
[29:38] received him and now live for him we are
[29:41] a part of that amen can you imagine that
[29:45] lady looked and said ma what have I done
[29:47] they had to tent her house and fumigate
[29:49] her house to get rid of all the spiders
[29:51] you imagine Satan said what did I do
[29:55] praise God I don't just have one now
[29:57] I've got thousands millions of them

[36:53] attitude they wonder why your blessings
[36:57] is becoming real in their life oh god oh
[37:01] Lord I can look at the Young Rich ruler

[37:13] religious man but you told him sell all
[37:17] that you have give to the poor come and
[37:21] follow me and he couldn't do it father
[37:24] and then he went on to become
[37:29] richer than ever
[37:31] he was busy Lord taking care of the
[37:35] Natural Things of this life and he said
[37:39] well I know God is blessing me I'm
[37:42] tearing down small barns from buildings
[37:45] I don't need to go to the Lord's Supper
[37:48] in communion service they'll understand
[37:51] I'm making more money for the kingdom of
[37:55] God oh God oh I have so much money I
[37:58] give two percent which is more than all
[38:01] the others combined because I'm so rich
[38:03] when God requires for us to give 10
[38:07] percent otherwise we're stealing we're
[38:10] robbing God as Jesus Lord how much more
[38:13] can you speak to our hearts if we are
[38:16] not lining up to your word you cannot

[38:22] well Lord I want to be use of you if
[38:26] there's um repent of sin if there's
[38:28] unbelief God cannot do any of us it's
[38:33] time to recognize there's Redemption

[39:00] saying why people can't get the Holy
[39:03] Ghost can get right with God because
[39:06] they're not sincere enough and I
[39:09] remember the example that brother Brown
[39:12] said about Buddy Robinson he knew he did
[39:16] have it so he was driving through a
[39:18] cornfield one day he stopped his truck
[39:21] and he cried out to you later unless you
[39:25] fill me with the Holy Ghost you'll find
[39:28] a pile of bones here yes and brother
[39:30] Brown said he got it then yes this time
[39:32] that we recognize we need to repent

[40:04] infirmities yes and with your stripes we
[40:07] are healed amen and Lord we can claim
[40:10] total Deliverance Lord we believe this I
[40:14] heard brother Brown saying that God
[40:17] wants us to ask he wants us to keep
[40:21] asking amen he wants us to believe we
[40:24] can live a thousand lifestimes and you
[40:26] can never exhaust the blessings and the
[40:30] promises of God oh Lord how much you
[40:33] believe help us to walk in the light at
[40:36] all times and Lord there's some that

[40:41] Pilots are religious and the prophet
[40:44] said don't uh jump any higher than your
[40:47] own confession lord it's searching time
[40:51] and imma close with this silver message
[40:55] Lord that I read Revelations 9. Lord it
[40:59] just spoke to my heart that's where you
[41:01] mentioned that death will flee from the
[41:04] people they are in the Great Tribulation
[41:06] yes there's something that might say
[41:08] well if I don't make it I'll be foolish
[41:10] virgin read Revelations 9. open up their
[41:15] hearts let them see that it is
[41:19] definitely what it's it's a time that's
[41:22] more horrible than it's ever been in the
[41:25] face of this Earth Brethren even said
[41:27] there'll be locusts with long hair and
[41:30] I'll more men men for five months and
[41:33] brother Brown said it'll be the women

[41:38] torment that comes oh god oh Lord I love
[41:41] these people I love my pastor he I want
[41:45] to see everyone make it but if we're not
[41:48] being sincere we're not truly repented

[53:30] pray amen
[53:32] amen Saint John chapter 16 we'll read a
[53:36] few verses and let you be seated
[53:38] these things have I spoken unto you that
[53:41] you should not be offended
[53:44] they shall put you out of the synagogue
[53:46] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[53:49] killeth you will think that they doeth
[53:51] God of service
[53:53] and these things will they do unto you
[53:55] because they have not known the father
[53:57] nor me but these things have I told you
[54:00] that when the time shall Come Ye uh you
[54:04] may remember that I told you of them and
[54:07] these things I said not unto you at the
[54:09] beginning because I was with you but now
[54:13] I go my way to him that sent me and none
[54:16] of you ask me whether thou goest but
[54:19] because I have said these things unto
[54:21] you sorrow had filled your heart
[54:23] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[54:27] expedient for for you for you that I go
[54:31] away for if I go not away the comforter
[54:34] will not come unto you but if I depart I
[54:37] will send him unto you you could be
[54:40] seated if you'd like
[54:43] amen I want to speak of course Easter is
[54:46] a little bit of a Twist on it uh you
[54:49] know he has a risen but the twist I want
[54:51] to give to it today is uh and the title
[54:54] of the message today is a greater work
[54:56] a greater work that was a it was a
[55:00] fantastic thing that Jesus was here and
[55:02] it was it was an extraordinary thing and
[55:04] of course if you're one of the disciples
[55:06] there and you're with Jesus and you have
[55:09] the Revelation to know who Jesus was it
[55:12] was quite an outstanding thing to live
[55:13] in that day to rub elbows with him to
[55:16] break bread with him to drink wine with
[55:18] him to enjoy his company and to see the
[55:20] Miracles and all the things that took
[55:22] place and and just to be a part of it
[55:24] had to have been just
[55:26] the outer body experience I mean what
[55:30] kind of verbiage could you put on that I
[55:31] mean really if you were there and and a
[55:34] part of that and having him with you and
[55:36] how important it was to have him with
[55:38] you but God had after that work was to
[55:42] be completed there was a greater work
[55:44] that God had that he wanted to get
[55:46] accomplished and to understand that that
[55:49] greater work was to be manifested
[55:51] through a mini-membered body that God
[55:54] said I need to go away in fact he told
[55:58] them it is expedient it is important it
[56:01] is it is of grave importance that I
[56:05] leave it's important to you he said did
[56:08] you imagine if you were standing there
[56:10] and God Jesus looked in you and said
[56:13] it's important expedient for you that I
[56:17] go away could you imagine how you'd
[56:19] think why would it be expedient for me
[56:21] that you live me we love you we want you
[56:24] here we want you by our side we want to
[56:26] keep walking with you talking with you
[56:28] learning from you we want to keep seeing
[56:31] the Miracles and being a part of your
[56:33] life well of course any normal human
[56:35] thinking that that is in that position
[56:37] would feel that way but there was a
[56:40] greater work that God had that he needed
[56:42] to accomplish and that was that he would
[56:45] die and raise again and come back and
[56:48] live in millions of people so that the
[56:51] greater work that God had to accomplish
[56:53] would be accomplished he spoke to them
[56:57] and told them as much let's go through
[56:59] it again he said I've spoken these
[57:02] things that you should not be offended
[57:03] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[57:05] yea in the time cometh that they will
[57:08] kill you
[57:09] amen and that doesn't necessarily mean
[57:11] with a sword or a gun although it did
[57:15] come to that point especially through
[57:16] the Dark Ages but even in this last day
[57:19] even with the human tongue people are
[57:21] killing one another's character uh
[57:24] hating one another Without a Cause which
[57:26] the Bible says is murder and killing you
[57:29] thinking that they're doing God a
[57:31] service
[57:32] they think they're doing a work of God
[57:34] by doing this to you when in fact Jesus
[57:39] said those that do that don't know me or
[57:42] the one that sent me Ah that's pretty
[57:46] strong Saints but that's what Jesus said
[57:48] because these things look now
[57:51] and these things will they do unto you
[57:54] because they have not known the father
[57:55] nor me but these things have I told you
[57:59] that when the time comes let's speak
[58:01] through this a little bit that when the
[58:03] time shall come ye may remember you may
[58:07] remember that I told you these things
[58:10] that I told you of them amen this will
[58:13] come to your remembrance now what's he
[58:15] preparing them for he's preparing them
[58:17] for his departure yes he's preparing
[58:20] them to live out the life that God had
[58:23] predestined for them after his going
[58:26] away and he's telling them after I'm
[58:29] gone away you're going to remember that
[58:32] I told you these things it's going to
[58:34] come back to your remembrance that I
[58:35] told you of them and these things I said
[58:38] unto you at the beginning because I was
[58:41] with you see there's that separation
[58:44] there's that differentiation between the
[58:48] time that Jesus was with them and told
[58:50] them how expedient it was that he go
[58:54] away yeah yes for them Expedia for them
[58:57] that he go away but he says I've told
[59:00] you these things and I've done these
[59:02] things with you because I was with you
[59:06] amen
[59:08] but now I go my way to him that sent me
[59:13] and none of you asking me whether thou
[59:15] goeth or where go where the uh whether
[59:17] goest out but because I have said these
[59:20] things unto you sorrow hath filled your
[59:23] heart now of course it would I I got it
[59:26] and obviously I you know we can look
[59:29] back at the picture and understand the
[59:31] bigger picture but they didn't have that
[59:33] then all they had was Jesus right there
[59:36] and they wanted him to stay right there
[59:38] and I don't blame them
[59:40] if I had been there I would have wanted
[59:43] to him to stay right there too I would
[59:46] have never wanted Jesus to go away I
[59:48] would have wanted him with me always I'm
[59:51] sure people uh and please don't get me
[59:53] wrong I am not uh trying to make brother
[59:56] random God but I imagine that people
[59:58] that lived with brother Banner or spent
[1:00:00] time with Brother Brad was were around
[1:00:02] brother Brown regularly and one of those
[1:00:05] people was brother green which I spent a
[1:00:07] lot of time with for about 20 years so I
[1:00:10] come to understand you you wouldn't want
[1:00:14] that to happen
[1:00:15] you wouldn't want that person to go away
[1:00:18] I mean
[1:00:21] I just think of that as just in a
[1:00:23] nominal sense for my family or my wife
[1:00:26] uh I would never want to live I may have
[1:00:29] to someday but I'd never want to live
[1:00:31] one moment on this planet without her
[1:00:33] but wouldn't want to I wouldn't want her
[1:00:35] to go away and and you think of it in a
[1:00:38] greater sense in a spiritual sense you
[1:00:40] wouldn't want Jesus to go away he's
[1:00:43] become your Palace become your buddies
[1:00:45] become your friend he's become your
[1:00:46] Confidant he's become everything to them
[1:00:49] there amen everything that they had
[1:00:52] everything they were they dropped and
[1:00:54] left everything that they did their
[1:00:57] livelihoods their their careers
[1:00:59] everything that they had they walked
[1:01:02] away from it just to follow him and now
[1:01:05] he's telling them it it's expedient it
[1:01:08] is important it is needful for you that
[1:01:11] I go away
[1:01:13] can you imagine the the the the thoughts
[1:01:16] that will come in their minds and and
[1:01:18] thinking why would it be good for me if
[1:01:23] you left me
[1:01:24] the only reason I left my family the
[1:01:26] only reason I left my job the only
[1:01:28] reason I left my livelihood and
[1:01:30] everything about like the only reason I
[1:01:32] did all that is because of you and now
[1:01:33] you're going away
[1:01:35] but see they didn't understand right but
[1:01:38] they would and Jesus told them you will
[1:01:41] know it will come to you and you will
[1:01:44] know but see it's one of those things as
[1:01:47] humanity is humans that we're
[1:01:49] uncomfortable with and that's the
[1:01:51] unknown
[1:01:52] when we don't know something it becomes
[1:01:54] very uncomfortable to us and when
[1:01:57] somebody says something and say well
[1:01:58] it's going to be this do this
[1:02:00] we don't know that it becomes a very
[1:02:03] uncomfortable situation and I'm sure as
[1:02:06] much as they believe in trusted Jesus it
[1:02:08] was a very uncomfortable situation for
[1:02:10] them even though he was telling them
[1:02:13] that of the unknown to say it when
[1:02:15] you're gone what are we supposed to do
[1:02:17] now
[1:02:18] amen and he said but you will remember
[1:02:21] amen I'm telling you these things
[1:02:24] because I'm here with you and when I'm
[1:02:26] not here with you you'll remember it
[1:02:29] it'll come back to your remembrance nine
[1:02:33] nevertheless even though they were so
[1:02:35] nevertheless I tell you the truth
[1:02:38] it is expedient to you for you that I go
[1:02:43] away
[1:02:46] how could anybody think that it would
[1:02:48] have been better for them if Jesus
[1:02:49] weren't with them
[1:02:52] I I couldn't imagine that
[1:02:55] amen how could you think in a in a body
[1:02:58] form again stepping into the unknown in
[1:03:01] a bodily form how could you think that
[1:03:03] him not being here would be better than
[1:03:05] him being there but that's what he told
[1:03:07] him
[1:03:08] how many times does God say that to us
[1:03:12] but see God always knows the better way
[1:03:14] God always knows what's more important
[1:03:17] for us God always knows what what is
[1:03:20] going to be beneficial to us down the
[1:03:22] road and sometimes it makes us
[1:03:24] uncomfortable sometimes it makes us sad
[1:03:28] sometimes it makes us sorrowful
[1:03:30] sometimes it makes us wanting amen but
[1:03:35] God knows that once we get beyond that
[1:03:38] point it's going to be better for us in
[1:03:40] the other situation and he's telling him
[1:03:43] it's going to be better for you than I'm
[1:03:45] going away
[1:03:46] amen why Jesus why
[1:03:50] for if I go not away the comforter will
[1:03:53] not come unto you but if I depart I will
[1:03:57] send him unto you now at one time see
[1:04:00] the disciples were living now
[1:04:03] in so much of a sense of the word the
[1:04:07] disciples were living a very comfortable
[1:04:08] life
[1:04:10] amen they were living a very easy life
[1:04:12] because Jesus was with them
[1:04:15] everything was on him
[1:04:17] everything was about him the focus
[1:04:20] wasn't on them the focus was on him
[1:04:22] everything about him when they came it
[1:04:25] was about Jesus what they did it was
[1:04:28] about Jesus when there was decision made
[1:04:30] Jesus made it when there was something
[1:04:32] that needed to be done Jesus did it he
[1:04:35] was with them yes but it was easy for
[1:04:38] them because everything was on him it
[1:04:40] becomes the same thing uh uh today
[1:04:44] amen but God doesn't want us in a lazy
[1:04:47] chair
[1:04:48] God doesn't want us in a flowery bed of
[1:04:51] ease he wants us
[1:04:52] gird up our loins and ready to ready for
[1:04:56] battle Emma
[1:04:58] Emma he wants us moving he wants us
[1:05:00] living he wants us doing for him amen
[1:05:03] not just sitting back and letting him do
[1:05:05] it but us do it yes yes he does it but
[1:05:08] how does he do it today he does it
[1:05:10] through us
[1:05:11] he uses your hands he uses your feet he
[1:05:15] uses your mind he uses your muscles he
[1:05:17] uses your personality he uses your gifts
[1:05:20] he uses your intelligence yes amen
[1:05:23] everything that God's give you he gave
[1:05:25] you for a purpose some people look and
[1:05:27] say well I'm tall why I'm short why I'm
[1:05:32] a male why I'm a female why I was grown
[1:05:36] in this house why with these parents I I
[1:05:39] I was born in this place I was raised in
[1:05:42] this city I was but but why why does all
[1:05:45] that happen because God predestined and
[1:05:47] ordained it to be so remember brother
[1:05:51] green said that brother Branham told him
[1:05:54] that God now forget pardon me if I
[1:05:57] forget some of the details but brother
[1:05:59] green says that brother Brown told him
[1:06:01] that God brought his dad from so and so
[1:06:04] a place and his mother from so and so a
[1:06:06] place to meet it so and so a place to
[1:06:09] fall in love get married to fruit to to
[1:06:11] breed this is his words to breed him
[1:06:18] amen that's exactly what he said that's
[1:06:21] what brother green said many times
[1:06:23] God had Perry Lee and his mother to come
[1:06:27] from places need Fallen up to breed
[1:06:30] Perry green
[1:06:33] then who are we to say
[1:06:35] amen the Lord brought me 2300 miles from
[1:06:39] Charlotte North Carolina Tucson
[1:06:40] Arizona's godforsaken country I thought
[1:06:42] it was at the time
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:45] I hated it here uh with a passion I
[1:06:49] lived for two things
[1:06:51] honestly Saints when I came here as a 14
[1:06:53] year old kid I lived for two things that
[1:06:56] was to draw my next breath and get out
[1:06:58] of Tucson
[1:07:00] that's the only two things I lived for
[1:07:03] then a couple weeks later I met my wife
[1:07:05] and everything changed after that not
[1:07:07] everything but a lot of it changed but
[1:07:10] send me out here to do what
[1:07:13] oh how many times how many things could
[1:07:16] I tell you the testimony of how God
[1:07:19] brought me and my wife together yeah
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:23] it just it's just one Miracle after
[1:07:25] another
[1:07:26] why God put us where he put us and moved
[1:07:29] on my dad to have us in the place that
[1:07:32] we're you know that I actually
[1:07:36] I out I was late getting I'll give you
[1:07:39] this one uh there's there's several of
[1:07:41] them I'll give you this one
[1:07:43] I was late coming here because school in
[1:07:46] North Carolina started later than it did
[1:07:48] here
[1:07:49] so the high school here had been going
[1:07:51] on for two or three weeks before we ever
[1:07:53] moved here even though it just started
[1:07:54] in North Carolina so I was behind so I
[1:07:57] couldn't get the classes I wanted
[1:07:59] I was gonna drop ban I was never gonna
[1:08:01] be in band again but because I couldn't
[1:08:04] get the classes they're like they're
[1:08:06] saying well there's only this elective
[1:08:08] and this elective left
[1:08:11] and I'm like okay I guess I'll I guess
[1:08:13] I'll go back into the band again guess
[1:08:15] where I met my wife
[1:08:18] in band I was never going to be in band
[1:08:21] again I was I was I and I ended up
[1:08:25] because I was so mad and I was so
[1:08:27] discouraged and I hated this place and
[1:08:29] wanted to go back home
[1:08:31] that I just smoked around I ended up
[1:08:33] sitting in the locker room and a teacher
[1:08:36] come by and said where are you supposed
[1:08:37] to be well I said I have no idea I don't
[1:08:39] care
[1:08:40] he said well come with me he was the
[1:08:43] Freshman teacher of PE
[1:08:46] and Sonia was in his class
[1:08:50] I was a sophomore and ended up in a
[1:08:53] freshman's PE class just so I could be
[1:08:56] with her
[1:08:58] amen you say what you want but that's
[1:09:00] the truth
[1:09:01] a sophomore was in a freshman's PE class
[1:09:05] because the teacher just come and said
[1:09:07] okay come with me you'll be in my class
[1:09:09] now why did a teacher do that why didn't
[1:09:12] he just say well give me your schedule
[1:09:14] who's supposed to be your teacher what
[1:09:16] grade are you in nothing he said well
[1:09:18] come with me and I ended up that whole
[1:09:20] semester and my wife's PE class which is
[1:09:24] a freshman class that I wasn't supposed
[1:09:25] to be
[1:09:29] you explain that right amen and that's
[1:09:32] just one of them well I guess that's two
[1:09:35] actually the band
[1:09:36] that God did just Miracle why God's in
[1:09:41] control and if and I hated it here but
[1:09:44] God had me here for a reason I couldn't
[1:09:46] stand this place but God had a purpose
[1:09:48] yes amen I may never know the exact
[1:09:53] purpose behind it all
[1:09:55] you look back and you see this this and
[1:09:58] this this but God knows whatever it is
[1:10:00] that's up to him amen all we try to do
[1:10:03] is become obedient amen live the life
[1:10:06] that God would have us to live and be
[1:10:09] what he wants us to be that's all we can
[1:10:10] do but that's what he expects of us amen
[1:10:14] even though it makes us uncomfortable
[1:10:16] even though it was making these
[1:10:18] disciples uncomfortable
[1:10:20] he said if I don't go the greater work
[1:10:24] can't manifest itself in and through you
[1:10:27] if he was still here that greater work
[1:10:30] could not be accomplished because it was
[1:10:32] all on Jesus
[1:10:34] they had it easy because it was all on
[1:10:37] him
[1:10:38] amen it wasn't on them but
[1:10:42] when he finished his work here
[1:10:45] when Jesus went away
[1:10:47] they went into the upper roof it became
[1:10:49] their time
[1:10:51] now it has become our time
[1:10:55] this is our time this is the bride time
[1:10:58] this is the bride revival time it is up
[1:11:02] to us to fulfill that purpose that God
[1:11:05] died and went to hell and rose again and
[1:11:09] came back upon us it's our time to prove
[1:11:12] and to live the point the purpose that
[1:11:15] God put us here for yes
[1:11:17] amen and it is not forgive me Saints but
[1:11:22] it is not to just for the purpose of
[1:11:24] turning oxygen into carbon dioxide
[1:11:27] God put us here for a greater purpose
[1:11:29] than that
[1:11:31] let us find what that purpose is
[1:11:36] a certain gender you're a certain race
[1:11:38] you speak a certain language you all
[1:11:40] these things God did to mold your
[1:11:42] character your personality to make you
[1:11:44] who you are
[1:11:46] I mean I if I tried long enough and hard
[1:11:49] enough and and really focused for a long
[1:11:52] enough period of time I might could play
[1:11:53] the piano like Micah but I don't have a
[1:11:57] desire to do that
[1:11:59] somehow that desire skipped right over
[1:12:02] me
[1:12:03] and landed right on him and from the
[1:12:06] time I can remember he's had such a
[1:12:08] passion for music amen but there's a
[1:12:10] reason for that yes God has that for a
[1:12:13] purpose and reason pardon me if I speak
[1:12:16] of myself or my family but I know us
[1:12:18] better than you amen but you can look
[1:12:21] back in your own mind and think of those
[1:12:23] things and identify yourself in the
[1:12:25] scripture with that yes just like they
[1:12:28] were with that see there was that
[1:12:31] purpose see when he was here it was his
[1:12:34] time but when he went away
[1:12:37] and rose again it became our time
[1:12:41] it became the disciples time
[1:12:43] and now it's our time here today this is
[1:12:46] our time amen let's look in Saint John
[1:12:49] chapter 14.
[1:12:56] Saint John chapter 14 just the page over
[1:13:01] verse 15.
[1:13:04] if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:13:08] and I will pray the father and he shall
[1:13:11] give you another comforter that now look
[1:13:14] look at the verbiage that Jesus is
[1:13:15] giving to his disciples here now
[1:13:20] he shall give you another comforter
[1:13:23] that he may abide with you forever he
[1:13:27] may abide with you forever
[1:13:32] even the spirit of Truth which was Jesus
[1:13:36] whom the world cannot receive which was
[1:13:39] Jesus
[1:13:41] because it sealed him not neither
[1:13:43] knoweth him speaking of himself
[1:13:46] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[1:13:51] again speaking of himself and shall be
[1:13:55] in you
[1:13:56] he's he's telling them of the
[1:14:00] manifestation of what took place at the
[1:14:03] damn Pentecost of the upper room
[1:14:07] he said when the Holy Spirit Come it was
[1:14:10] with him and it lit on them and went in
[1:14:13] them
[1:14:14] Jesus is telling that very thing
[1:14:17] dwelleth with you with you and and is a
[1:14:21] conjunction joins the two parts together
[1:14:24] shall be shall be in you
[1:14:28] so now look before when Jesus was here
[1:14:32] it was shall be in you
[1:14:36] amen when he was here let's continue to
[1:14:39] read though
[1:14:40] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:14:43] come to you yet a little while in the
[1:14:45] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[1:14:47] because I live ye shall live also at
[1:14:51] that day ye shall know that I am in the
[1:14:53] father of the father in me uh in my
[1:14:55] father and ye and me and I in you
[1:14:58] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[1:15:01] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[1:15:04] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[1:15:06] and I will love him and will manifest
[1:15:08] myself to him Judah said unto him not as
[1:15:12] curious Lord how is it that thou will
[1:15:15] manifest thyself to us and not unto the
[1:15:18] world
[1:15:19] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:15:22] man loved me he will keep my words
[1:15:24] there's the difference
[1:15:27] amen I love my wife now this is just in
[1:15:31] the physical form I love my wife thus
[1:15:35] for the past 40 plus years I've come to
[1:15:38] know my wife better than the rest of the
[1:15:41] world
[1:15:42] nobody knows her like I do
[1:15:45] they're Secrets I know that nobody else
[1:15:47] knows and vice versa amen but it's
[1:15:51] because I love her
[1:15:52] Jesus said if you love me you'll do what
[1:15:55] I tell you yes you'll keep my
[1:15:57] Commandments you'll do my work amen he
[1:16:01] said if you if if a man loved me he will
[1:16:04] keep my words and my father will love
[1:16:07] him and he will come unto him and make
[1:16:09] our Abode with him
[1:16:12] he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[1:16:14] sayings and the word which ye hear is
[1:16:17] not mine and the Father which sent me
[1:16:19] these things have I spoken unto you
[1:16:21] being yet present with you
[1:16:24] but the comforter which is noticed he
[1:16:26] says that over and over here now while
[1:16:29] I'm with you again Jesus differentiating
[1:16:33] and setting aside the part of the with
[1:16:36] you part to the expedient of going away
[1:16:39] to the greater work part amen the
[1:16:43] greater work
[1:16:44] these things have I spoke yet being
[1:16:46] present with you but the comforter which
[1:16:47] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:16:50] send in my name he shall teach you all
[1:16:52] things and bring all things to your
[1:16:54] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:16:56] you peace I leave with you my peace I
[1:16:59] give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:17:01] give I unto you let not your heart be
[1:17:04] troubled need let neither Let It Be
[1:17:06] Afraid
[1:17:07] yeah I've heard now I said unto you I go
[1:17:10] away and come again unto you if you love
[1:17:12] me ye would Rejoice because I said I go
[1:17:15] unto the father for the father is
[1:17:16] greater than I and now I have told you
[1:17:19] before it come to pass that when it has
[1:17:21] come to pass you might believe
[1:17:23] Hereafter I will not talk much with you
[1:17:27] God's skin making that separating point
[1:17:30] he's giving them the time of the change
[1:17:32] it's changing over and I talk much with
[1:17:36] you for the prince of this world coming
[1:17:38] and have nothing in me but that the
[1:17:41] world may know that I love the father
[1:17:43] and as the father gave me commandment
[1:17:46] even so I do also uh that I do arise let
[1:17:50] us go hence he's giving them a a parable
[1:17:54] and a reality of understanding this is
[1:17:58] what I do and now here is what it is and
[1:18:00] what you've seen up to here is be has
[1:18:03] been me with you
[1:18:05] but a greater work time is coming to
[1:18:08] where I'm going to go away
[1:18:10] and the one that raised me is going to
[1:18:13] come in you the comforter is going to
[1:18:15] come in you and you are then going to
[1:18:17] become
[1:18:19] disciples
[1:18:20] you are going to be Messiah says brother
[1:18:23] Brandon would call them you with the
[1:18:25] spirit of God in you will be led by the
[1:18:28] spirit to live according to the word and
[1:18:31] God will take care of you and watch over
[1:18:34] you yes it was
[1:18:36] up to that point
[1:18:38] Jesus always referred you go and look
[1:18:40] through the gospels Jesus always
[1:18:42] referred and said shall be
[1:18:46] shall be but now notice afterwards let's
[1:18:50] go to First Corinthians
[1:18:52] after that time
[1:18:56] when God spoke
[1:18:58] and he spoke in his word and he spoke
[1:19:00] through men it was no longer
[1:19:03] shall be
[1:19:06] it transitioned
[1:19:08] when Jesus rose from the grave it
[1:19:11] changed everything
[1:19:13] every man to that point had stayed in
[1:19:16] the grave every man that had uh that had
[1:19:20] lost their breath and had died and gone
[1:19:23] in the grave was still there
[1:19:25] when Jesus rose again it changed
[1:19:28] everything right
[1:19:29] right praise God
[1:19:31] amen and it changed them
[1:19:35] change them
[1:19:37] of Greater work than even when he was
[1:19:40] here
[1:19:41] praise the Lord did he not did not he
[1:19:43] say that
[1:19:44] he told them
[1:19:46] that Greater Works shall you do they did
[1:19:49] not tell them that
[1:19:51] greater work shall you do amen look
[1:19:55] First Corinthians shall it shall be in
[1:19:59] you first Corinthians 6 19.
[1:20:03] Paul says what
[1:20:05] no ye not that your body is
[1:20:10] amen is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:14] which is in you amen no longer shall be
[1:20:21] the transition has confirmed it's been
[1:20:24] changed it's been completed it is no
[1:20:27] longer shall be in you which Jesus said
[1:20:30] it is now is in you praise God that
[1:20:36] transition changed mankind
[1:20:39] from being just in one man amen just
[1:20:42] like that spider on the wall from one
[1:20:45] man
[1:20:46] to a mini-membered body
[1:20:49] to multi millions of people since the
[1:20:52] day of Pentecost yes that have come into
[1:20:55] this truth and believed his word and
[1:20:57] accepted Christ as their Savior and been
[1:20:59] born again
[1:21:01] from that time to this time Millions
[1:21:04] have gone around the world even when the
[1:21:08] disciples started it once it was Jesus
[1:21:11] and they followed him
[1:21:13] amen they didn't go away from Jesus they
[1:21:15] followed Jesus where he went that's what
[1:21:18] that's where they went
[1:21:19] with that's what they did
[1:21:21] when Jesus left this one went that
[1:21:25] that way this one went that way and this
[1:21:27] one went that way
[1:21:29] so it wasn't just one man and a bunch of
[1:21:31] people following him to one city it was
[1:21:33] a man going to this city and a man going
[1:21:35] to that City and a man going to that
[1:21:37] City and it was and when when God
[1:21:40] changed it from him to that greater work
[1:21:42] it wasn't just that one city it was a
[1:21:45] dozen cities that was hearing the gospel
[1:21:47] it became to the point that uh that that
[1:21:51] Paul and Barnabas got into such
[1:21:53] contention
[1:21:54] which we talk about today it became in
[1:21:57] such contention with each other that
[1:21:59] they had to separate because Paul had to
[1:22:02] go that way and Barnabas had to go that
[1:22:04] way right why so more people could
[1:22:06] really come
[1:22:07] yes
[1:22:08] the greater work was to be done
[1:22:11] people were to see the manifestation of
[1:22:14] Jesus Christ working in their midst they
[1:22:17] wanted to feel it become a part of it
[1:22:19] for that Spirit to fall on them it
[1:22:23] wasn't just for the upper room Saints
[1:22:25] that's that those gifts of the Spirit
[1:22:27] that Spirit falling on them it wasn't
[1:22:30] just for those of that 120 in that Upper
[1:22:32] Room
[1:22:33] it was to whosoever Will
[1:22:36] if we believe and receive it and Obey
[1:22:39] that word it is for us just as much as
[1:22:41] it was for them yes and the disciples
[1:22:44] didn't keep it to themselves and say oh
[1:22:47] thank God now I got it let me go find an
[1:22:49] easy chair somewhere and sit down all
[1:22:51] right I'm just going to enjoy my life
[1:22:53] now
[1:22:55] now they got busy about the father's
[1:22:57] business
[1:22:58] amen they went around telling as much as
[1:23:01] the Lord would leave amen as much as the
[1:23:04] Lord would lead now you know me
[1:23:07] if a person wants to go and do you go
[1:23:10] and do
[1:23:11] and that's up to you and that's on you
[1:23:13] but if God leads you God is obligated to
[1:23:17] take care of you right right God is
[1:23:19] obligated to let the words be manifested
[1:23:22] in their lives where God sends you if
[1:23:25] God sends you to somebody then you can
[1:23:28] know that that's God that's doing work
[1:23:30] for them
[1:23:31] amen you don't hide it under a bushel
[1:23:34] you don't keep it to yourself the
[1:23:35] greater work says to go even to all the
[1:23:38] world and preach the gospel
[1:23:40] amen and we do that as God gives us
[1:23:43] utterance
[1:23:44] thankfully by the grace of God I'll uh I
[1:23:48] may never know why the Lord blessed me
[1:23:50] with the job I have now and I like it
[1:23:52] I'm thankful for it
[1:23:54] that I
[1:23:56] I can stand before you as a group of
[1:23:58] people and God is my witness that those
[1:24:00] men have changed
[1:24:01] since I've been there every one of them
[1:24:05] the curmudgeon I told you about he's no
[1:24:08] longer a curmudgeon he's become one of
[1:24:10] my best friends
[1:24:12] he's become one of my greatest advocacy
[1:24:14] uh uh advocates
[1:24:17] amen one guy's even quit drinking
[1:24:21] he stopped drinking at first he quit
[1:24:24] drinking beer and I talked to myself
[1:24:27] what was the point of that last this
[1:24:29] whole week last time I never saw him
[1:24:31] drink a drink
[1:24:32] he didn't tell me he quit drinking but I
[1:24:34] didn't see him drink one alcoholic
[1:24:35] beverage
[1:24:37] amen God has a reason there's a purpose
[1:24:40] with everything sings all you got to do
[1:24:43] you don't have to go preach the people
[1:24:45] but just let your light shine Paul said
[1:24:47] I become all things to all men that I
[1:24:49] might win some yeah we forget that
[1:24:51] sometimes yes because we become so Pious
[1:24:54] and holier than thou and up on our high
[1:24:56] horse and preaching down to people that
[1:24:58] we forget that they're human Souls were
[1:25:01] 10 million worlds yeah yeah Amen to try
[1:25:03] to help understand and become as they
[1:25:06] are that you might get them to
[1:25:07] understand wow there's really something
[1:25:08] to this this person is not just spouting
[1:25:11] a bunch of garbage or hyperbole to me he
[1:25:14] means what he says he stands behind his
[1:25:17] convictions
[1:25:18] there's a reason there's things that
[1:25:21] happen Saints and it's God that does it
[1:25:23] it's God working through US amen and he
[1:25:27] continues to work through us but notice
[1:25:29] once it was all in him now it's not when
[1:25:33] he rose again the greater work began to
[1:25:35] take place he came on them in the upper
[1:25:38] room just like he told them when he was
[1:25:40] with them and since that time he's
[1:25:42] poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh now
[1:25:45] not all receive it amen that anointing
[1:25:48] is everywhere of course but the the
[1:25:51] indwelling presence of the holy spirit
[1:25:53] is for those that believe it love it
[1:25:55] receive it now brother Graham said
[1:25:58] receive it he said that's the that's the
[1:26:00] evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving
[1:26:02] the word for your day yes amen it's not
[1:26:05] love it's not all these
[1:26:08] evidences it's receiving the word for
[1:26:11] your day and if you receive the word
[1:26:13] that means you're going to live it yes
[1:26:15] you're going to live by it it's going to
[1:26:18] be more than words to you yes amen
[1:26:20] you're going to live what he said and
[1:26:22] Jesus said if you love me now that just
[1:26:24] conversely brings it right back around
[1:26:26] Jesus said if you love me that's agape
[1:26:29] love if you love me you
[1:26:32] yes keep my words amen
[1:26:35] that's what the evidence of the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost is not the love but that you obey
[1:26:39] his word
[1:26:40] amen Jesus said that himself those who
[1:26:43] love me obey me that do what my word
[1:26:46] says do amen no ye not
[1:26:49] that your body is
[1:26:51] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:26:55] in you which ye have of God and ye are
[1:26:58] not your own
[1:26:59] for ye are bought with a price therefore
[1:27:02] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:27:04] spirit which are gods amen
[1:27:08] God living in us now
[1:27:11] through us to prove he's the same Romans
[1:27:14] 8. I got a couple more scriptures here
[1:27:16] I'm going to close Romans 8.
[1:27:22] amen
[1:27:23] Romans 8 verse 10 and if Christ be in
[1:27:26] you
[1:27:27] the body is dead because of sin
[1:27:31] but the spirit is life because of
[1:27:34] righteousness
[1:27:35] but now look at what look at how Paul
[1:27:38] identifies this to the Roman Church
[1:27:41] because he's differentiating between the
[1:27:44] spirit of man and the body of man
[1:27:47] right if Christ be in you
[1:27:52] the body is dead the outside
[1:27:56] because of sin
[1:27:58] amen unbelief why this outside man is
[1:28:03] fed by a sea tasteful smell here not
[1:28:07] faith
[1:28:08] the outside man doesn't live on faith
[1:28:12] the outside man is Reliant upon the
[1:28:15] Inside Man to bring the faith to to a to
[1:28:19] manifestation in his life in his body
[1:28:23] but the body doesn't operate on faith
[1:28:26] it operates on what you can see right or
[1:28:29] what you can feel or what you can know
[1:28:31] or understand amen the spirit the body
[1:28:34] the spirit's the life of the body the
[1:28:36] spirit is Imagination affection reason
[1:28:39] memory what you can think about what you
[1:28:42] can see what you can reason and that's
[1:28:45] what the world lives by
[1:28:46] that's what they all depend upon that's
[1:28:49] why you see through this cover thing all
[1:28:51] them doctors get done saying that they
[1:28:53] know this and they know that and this is
[1:28:55] this and this is that and two three
[1:28:57] years later we find out that 90 of what
[1:28:59] they told us three years ago is wrong
[1:29:01] right but that's all they had and I
[1:29:04] don't fault them for that right what I
[1:29:06] fought them for is acting like God yes
[1:29:08] yes that's what I fought them for and
[1:29:10] staying in front of everybody saying I
[1:29:12] am science no you're not
[1:29:14] you're just a man who's going on the
[1:29:16] evidence you had at the time the best
[1:29:18] you know don't present yourself to me as
[1:29:19] God you are not God
[1:29:22] amen and and what we see and what we see
[1:29:24] continuing to manifest itself that's
[1:29:27] that's what the body understands to live
[1:29:29] by but that's all the world knows
[1:29:32] that's all they know friend
[1:29:34] amen and and that's what they live by
[1:29:36] and that's okay I don't fault them for
[1:29:38] that but we live by faith
[1:29:41] but the faith doesn't come from your
[1:29:44] body even your human Spirit it comes
[1:29:46] from the soul the inside that regulates
[1:29:49] to the spirit and regulates to the body
[1:29:52] that says I don't care what I can't see
[1:29:55] I don't care what I can't feel or taste
[1:29:58] I believe it anyhow am I because God's
[1:30:01] word says it
[1:30:03] amen amen amen the body didn't reason
[1:30:05] that this
[1:30:07] the the soul of man cried out that says
[1:30:09] this is what I believe
[1:30:12] amen
[1:30:13] only way it can be done not by the human
[1:30:15] Spirit not by the body that's why Paul
[1:30:18] said the body is dead if Christ being
[1:30:20] you the body is dead
[1:30:23] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:30:26] because of righteousness
[1:30:28] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:30:31] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:30:34] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:30:36] also Quicken what your mortal body
[1:30:41] praise God
[1:30:43] Paul here says if the if Christ be in
[1:30:46] you the body is dead but then he says if
[1:30:49] Christ be in you the body is uh uh if
[1:30:51] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:30:53] from the dead dwelling you he that
[1:30:55] raised up Christ from the devil will
[1:30:56] Quicken your mortal body
[1:31:02] it's no longer dead in sin
[1:31:05] it's been quickened praise the Lord amen
[1:31:08] your mortal Body by his spirit that
[1:31:11] dwelleth in you
[1:31:13] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:31:16] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:31:18] you leave after the flesh you shall die
[1:31:20] but if you do if ye through the spirit
[1:31:24] do mortify or that is deaden or kill the
[1:31:28] Deeds of the body ye shall live what are
[1:31:31] the Deeds of the body see taste a little
[1:31:33] smile here imagination effects from
[1:31:35] reason conscience amen which is
[1:31:39] amen you are dead but if we kill those
[1:31:42] things
[1:31:43] well if we kill those things and what
[1:31:45] happens then the soul of man is what
[1:31:48] begins to take over yes amen and that's
[1:31:51] where faith is and the soul of man
[1:31:53] begins to permeate itself through the
[1:31:55] spirit and through into the flesh so
[1:31:57] that you begin to live according to the
[1:32:00] dictates of your soul not your spirit or
[1:32:03] your sea tasteful smell amen
[1:32:06] it mortifies kills demons
[1:32:10] the Deeds of the body ye shall live
[1:32:14] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:32:17] God they are the sons of God amen God
[1:32:20] doesn't lead you by your brain yes God
[1:32:23] doesn't lead you by your eyeballs he
[1:32:25] does not lead you by your taste buds he
[1:32:28] leads you by the spirit that is in you
[1:32:31] not your human Spirit but his spirit
[1:32:34] that is in you yes how did that come
[1:32:37] about because he told them
[1:32:41] I will not only just be with you but
[1:32:43] I'll be in you
[1:32:45] in you praise God
[1:32:47] to work the greater workers manifested
[1:32:50] itself now the greater work is
[1:32:52] manifesting itself through us it is our
[1:32:55] responsibility to fulfill that greater
[1:32:58] work to live that greater what to let
[1:33:01] that greater work continue to manifest
[1:33:04] itself through US yes the purpose that
[1:33:07] God still has left on this planet
[1:33:08] whatever it may be we discussed earlier
[1:33:11] it may be a soul maybe one may be ten
[1:33:14] maybe a million we don't know but if
[1:33:16] God's manifesting himself through us
[1:33:19] then others will see Jesus in US yes
[1:33:22] amen others will come to know Jesus
[1:33:25] simply because they know you
[1:33:28] you say well that's a stretch brother
[1:33:29] you know it's not
[1:33:31] how else are these people going to see
[1:33:32] Christ if they don't see Christ in you
[1:33:35] that's right where else is he
[1:33:38] he's not in a flesh mortal body anymore
[1:33:42] he's not in the corporate body like he
[1:33:44] was with the disciples where is he where
[1:33:46] can he be found
[1:33:48] in me
[1:33:50] in you and the greater work that we are
[1:33:53] to do people talk about the gray word
[1:33:54] speaking in tongues and prophecy and all
[1:33:56] these gifts know the greater work is
[1:33:58] living the life of Jesus Christ
[1:34:00] being God before people
[1:34:03] letting God see that this world is not
[1:34:06] the way Jesus is the way this world does
[1:34:09] not have the truth or the life Jesus is
[1:34:12] the truth the life the way
[1:34:14] and if they can see that maybe they get
[1:34:17] just a little glimpse
[1:34:20] even if you just help make their lives a
[1:34:22] little bit better yes friend this life
[1:34:25] may be all that some people have
[1:34:28] and if you can do something even just to
[1:34:31] make that life that they're living now
[1:34:34] better wouldn't you want to do it
[1:34:37] they're gonna have
[1:34:40] but it seems like a lot of times we want
[1:34:42] we want we want them to be miserable I
[1:34:45] if this is all
[1:34:47] then yet does God make people miserable
[1:34:50] so they'll turn to him sure absolutely
[1:34:53] you can amen God can absolutely God can
[1:34:58] absolutely turn a person amen all right
[1:35:00] remember brother Dennis prayed about the
[1:35:02] Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler
[1:35:05] turned God down and what happened
[1:35:07] he got richer
[1:35:09] amen amen he got richer he didn't get
[1:35:11] miserable he God didn't make his life so
[1:35:15] miserable that he decided to come back
[1:35:17] to God he got richer and and begin to
[1:35:21] exhort that this this was the blessings
[1:35:24] of God
[1:35:25] this is God working his life in me
[1:35:28] where'd he end up we know where he ended
[1:35:30] up yeah
[1:35:31] yeah that's why I've always sinned time
[1:35:33] and time again if people leave the word
[1:35:36] leave church leave Christ and the and
[1:35:39] their lives don't get worse if they get
[1:35:42] better or more prosperous at worries me
[1:35:47] because that's not uh you're you're
[1:35:49] you're not if you're a child of God and
[1:35:52] you leave God your life isn't going to
[1:35:54] be peachy King right amen
[1:35:57] God can make your life so to the places
[1:36:00] you're like you know I am so mid think
[1:36:03] about the The Prodigal Son it took him
[1:36:07] to get in such a miserable condition
[1:36:09] that he was willing to stick his head
[1:36:12] down in the food that a pig eats before
[1:36:15] he came back to himself
[1:36:18] his life became so miserable he didn't
[1:36:21] leave his daddy and start prospering and
[1:36:23] and greatness happened to him no he was
[1:36:26] the son of the king he was the son of of
[1:36:28] his father
[1:36:30] so his life became more miserable right
[1:36:34] his life had got so miserable that he
[1:36:37] came back to himself right and that's
[1:36:39] when he went back home
[1:36:41] amen you understand what I'm saying
[1:36:44] Jesus said Paul said to the Roman Church
[1:36:48] that their lives that you could mortify
[1:36:51] the Deeds of the flesh amen

[1:39:30] Paul went through we're living in a
[1:39:31] different age
[1:39:33] it wasn't to the degree that the
[1:39:34] disciples had when they were going into
[1:39:36] these cities and all it's it's a
