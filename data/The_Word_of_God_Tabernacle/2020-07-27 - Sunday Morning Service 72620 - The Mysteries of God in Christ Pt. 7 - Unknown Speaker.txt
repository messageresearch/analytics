lord bless you today again welcome to the service i want to get right to the scriptures and again there's a little bit i want to talk about after this but i do want to try to finish this part today the lord willing again if not we can finish it up next week i don't want to i don't want to box god in so whatever god wants to say and whatever purpose he wants to be done today i want to do it so but my heart my my intention is to try to finish this today so uh and and then we'll have a little bit of time afterwards to uh discuss the things i wanted to discuss uh about with the with the church and the building and all that's coming up with that so um i do i do definitely want to get to that point so now we'll go as we're continuing on with the same subject that we've been on in revelation chapter 10 verse 7. uh the mysteries of god in christ is part seven the mysteries of god in christ part seven and this is god revealing himself to his people uh part three so i just uh trust this just to be a blessing now revelation chapter 10 verse 7 is where we normally begin our scripture reading here but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery singular of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets i know we read that every time but i do that as an opening as a as a re-understanding of what the scripture is saying here and and the point of view that we're coming from in this again basing it on brother branham's christ's mystery god revealed uh but understanding that the largest part of the christian world don't even fulfill that scripture because they don't know who jesus is a lot of people think they know who jesus is they think they have a revelation of jesus they think they have a personal relationship with jesus in a lot of ways but how can you have a personal relationship with somebody you don't know and a lot of them don't know him they know him as someone someone that somebody preaches about they know him about something that they read in this book they know him as maybe a second person whatever of a trinity or something like that but they don't know him know him personally and the revelation of this word in there most of them believe he's just part of a triunity of three different gods or something to that effect but they don't understand that mystery of god lies in jesus christ and when god's unveiling and unfolding himself to us down from the elohim that he was we read last week when he began created the heavens and the earth that that just unfolding down to us to where we could see and that god could reveal himself to us in that light and ending up in the place that we're going to get to which would be the second part of what we want to talk about is the mysteries of god in christ and that is god having his preeminence in his body of believers which brings us into that place so all these things to me friend all these things wind up in a place of bringing you to a to to an understanding of revelation of the scripture unto rapturing faith to be raptured you got to know who you are to know who you are you have to have faith and believe who you know you are and the only way you can know who you are and by faith believe that is to know who he is the only way you can know who he is is through the revelation of jesus christ the word has come for us in this day that's how you know so that's the point we're getting to to help this bring us in a closer relationship with the lord is to help us come to a greater revelation who he is and who he is and who we are in him in him in us so uh let's go and we're going to uh background a little bit more back in genesis chapter 3 and and come through genesis 3 we've read it uh several times i i really go and reference to genesis 3 quite a bit in several messages uh because there's just well genesis is the chief the the seed chapter uh if everything ever was it began here uh we can read in here and see in here the types and shadows we can see where god is unfolding and unveiling himself we can see in here the types and shadows as god is showing what he is going to do see even after the fall and of course this contains the fault so let's read genesis chapter 3 we'll begin with verse 1 and start there now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and remember we know that word subtle is is uh beguiling but also sensible what he's telling her is sensible and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the guard again that's the question to try to get her to doubt what god had told her the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruits of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die now remember and it doesn't say this directly in the bible but uh eve was not there when god gave adam that directive if adam if god gave to adam that directive it was adam's responsibility to give that directive to his wife to his help mate that directive was given to her and and she gave that to the serpent now and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god does know that the day ye thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and that is true but understand that directive didn't come from the serpent it came from satan satan incarnate in the serpent so we're dealing with two entities here the woman and the serpent who both got second hand if you could if we say it that way information you've got hers from adam the serpent got his from satan the directed that sir the serpent is giving to her he wasn't privy to he was just a part of the creation when god created the animal kingdom he created the serpent which was the which was to be next to the man so that the seed would mix he was just that part of that animal kingdom that was created there he didn't have that he didn't know that that came from the right hand man of god at one time angel of light lucifer became the devil serpent red dragon satan who came down and incarnated himself and this serpent and began to feed him this information so the information he got to be gallard came from the devil not not the serpent it wasn't his information he didn't know this she didn't know this either so you understand you're dealing with these two entities here that that are contrasting each other but the tactic of the enemy stays the same and that is to get you to doubt to get you to doubt god's word now let's continue on sixth verse and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and then it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat so exactly what the serpent threw satan the satan through the serpent told her actually happened what he told her was the truth it just was against god's word there's a lot of things that people say out here that they consider to be truths but it's not what it's not directives of god's word and we live by god's word understand now so what he said actually happened she took the fruit their oven did eat see and then gave also into her husband with her and he did eat so when eve found herself in this condition she came to her husband adam adam then seeing her in this condition loved her so much that he was not willing that god would destroy her because god would have destroyed her at that moment in time had adam his his son his created son come in and took in her into himself now again this is this is just a foreshadow of what we saw coming in jesus christ because jesus god's only son only begotten son became sin by taking us into himself and became sin took our sin so that we could be made righteous now there the redeeming value of the only created son of god wasn't there because he was just a flesh man he was but jesus was the begotten son the created son the blood cell in the womb of a woman mary uh had that redemptive value adam did not when adam fell he he he lost everything uh he lost his inheritance in life he lost his right to life he lost everything see but he did it because he loved his bride so much he loved his wife so much he was willing to become sin for her so that god would not destroy her well the only way friend that god doesn't destroy us today and wipe us off the face of the earth is because of his only son christ jesus that came and took us into himself and became sin for us went to the cross for us went to hell for us but praised god on the third day he rose victoriously and took everything that adam had lost into his possession now satan's still the squatter here this is still satan's eden but it is no longer in his purview it's no longer in his ownership it belongs to god if it belongs to god it belongs to all those that are of god that's me that's you praise the lord we belong in that in that uh in that light because that's who god has made us but you see the type the type there of adam going to get his bride he became sin so that she would not be destroyed and now the eyes seventh person the eyes of them both were open they knew they were naked they sowed fig leaves together made themselves aprons every time i read the scripture i say this brother brown said if it's an apple that mates a woman or a man think know that they're naked i believe it's time to pass the apples again or whatever fruit somebody wants to claim they knew that they were naked because of the act that took place between them amen one act two children see one act two children got cain and abel from this act that took place first of the serpent and planted his seed in her and then with adam the the only redemptive way it didn't bring man back to god but it brought that seed back to the place it was supposed to be so that the seed of the righteous one was able to produce a child abel just as the the seed of the wicked one the serpent seed which a lot of people did not even exist even though we'll read here in a minute but that god himself talked about the serpent seed the serpent having a seed that that it brought forth a cane see the two the transfer of the hemoglobin the blood is what created this sin and then adam coming in and redeeming back that that that that the serpent satan had stolen now it was in a fallen condition it entered into god's permissive will but it was a way that that man was able to uh forge forward from that point now we know of course they're expelled from the garden of eden normal beats there we go we're gonna read uh some more of this now uh they knew they were naked and so fig leaves together made themselves aprons of course that's the man's way of always trying to cope with god and that's their own man-made ideas uh it wasn't uh just like cain thought it wasn't body life that was satisfactory to redeem man back or bring bringing back into a place that uh uh of with god again had to take blood it was a blood sin the original sin was a blood sin it wasn't a botany life stand and it had to be a blood sacrifice to meet that sin amen said that several times before but again just to reiterate sometimes some people watch these videos that may not have watched another one so i just take a moment to reiterate that so if you've heard me say that by my apologies but again the original sin was a blood sin a blood transfer of the hemoglobin blood had to be a sacrifice to meet that sin so it had to be a blood sacrifice a body body life sacrifice was not sufficient to cover a blood sin understand though and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden now notice god in this so far adam has referred to his uh to the person we know as eve only his woman his wife or woman his wife hid themselves in the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou now god knew where adam was but god wanted to make sure adam knew where he was what have you done adam what have you partaken of what i told you not to partake of have you done exactly what i told you not to do where has that put you now where is your life what's going on in this garden this beautiful place that i give you see because god's god's omnipotent he's all-knowing he's he he knows exactly where adam is see but now he's saying where are thou and he said i heard that i voiced the garden i was afraid because i was naked i hid myself or i removed myself you didn't hide you can't hide from god a lot of people try to hide from god but you can't hide from god what he did is he removed himself he placed a barrier because see again friend this is the created son of god this is the lineage of god almighty adam was he was perfect in every way god made god created so you don't you can't tell me that we look at it in the way that we look at it coming in the world in the falling condition he wasn't like that he was the created son of god and he knew that when the situation arose we put himself and his wife in that he had to be removed there had to be something to separate because god said the day you eat thereof that day you're going to die or you're going to be separated from me well there had to be a buffer there so he removes himself separates himself so that he's not in the direct presence of god god help us you're getting the direct presence of god in the wrong condition friend that could that could spell doom for anyone but now let's move on and he said 11th verse and he said who told thee that thou was naked hath thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou should not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave is to me to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat it sounds a lot like today everybody wants to pass blame on somebody else for their own failures their own mistakes everybody wants to make everybody else responsible for their own happiness and and godliness it's not up to other people for you to be happy it's not up for other people to accept your responsibility you're responsible to god for yourself once you reach the age of accountability you're at a place that you're accountable to god for yourself so but it's kind of human becomes human nature in a falling condition and we just start blaming everybody else and everything else for our own mistakes and failures and that's exactly what they were doing in the garden of eden serpent began me i did eat 14th verse and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life so this this link that was used to be between the monkey and the man the one that was closest to the man the reason they cannot prove evolution as a fact was now cursed lost his limbs and was thrown onto his belly he was no more in an upright state he no more had limbs he fell and was on his belly and dust became his meat that was the serpent now that link every bone every uh facet every molecule of that being was changed because he was cursed now notice we're going to read it here but he never cursed a woman he never cursed adam see now they had other things that god put on them but he didn't curse them the only one he cursed was the serpent and in his cursing of the serpent he changed every molecule about every bit of the bone structure everything about this serpent and from an upright being with limbs like a man uh god cursed and put him on the ground dust shalt be thy meat all the days of thy light see thou art cursed above all the cattle above all the beasts of the field upon that belly shalt thou go dust shout thou eat all the days of thy life now look at this getting into another uh uh foreshadowing of jesus christ and i will put enmity between thee and the woman i will put you know division uh the enemies between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed so there had to be a serpent seed now if there if there is a serpent seed that serpent seed cannot exist now i'm trying to bring this out to understand where christ comes and plays this part in here but the serpent can't have a seed today lest there had to be a seed planted in this condition he was in before the curse the seed had to exist the seed had to be implanted and bring forth before god cursed him so that seed had to come forth at that time because now god's putting enmity an enemy division between that that comes forth as the serpent seed and that that comes forth as the woman's seed but now understand the woman doesn't have a seed the woman has an egg it's the man that has the hemoglobin the life the seed it's the man that has that that that is implanted that brings life to the egg see the woman doesn't have a seed so what is god talking about when he's talking about putting enmity division between a serpent seed now how can this serpent see be a serpent's seed from who they are today is a serpent crawling on its belly and and in the dust of the ground how could it be that way they don't even have eggs their babies are born live they're not hatched because nothing about this serpent the way it was before the curse is like it is now that serpent seed had already been implanted in the woman before the curse oh friend can we just see the scripture is so plain but that was implanted before the curse now he's cursed him and put in the deep division between his seed which came forth as cain we know we're not going to get to that but you read the fourth verse cain came forth and the bible says cain was of that wicked one he was nevada he was of the wicked one see that came forth we know that was that seed and immensely enmity between him and the woman's seat but that woman doesn't have a seed but old friend can't we understand that god appointed god appointed the woman a seed we've already read in isaiah when the prophecy came forth about the appointment of that seed god appointed her seed the seed that god created and planted in the woman mary appointed her that seed because she never knew a man if she never knew a man how was she going to receive seed she didn't receive seed for men because she never knew man so where the seed come from it was created seed it was a created seed of god that god placed in the womb of mary to bring forth jesus christ the only begotten son of god it was the only seed that could be of the woman that god gave her appointed her that seed a created seed and that division is still there today the division between satan and god the division between cain and abel the division between uh uh a judas and jesus the division today between those that are the righteous and those who are the ungodly is still the same today there's enmity there's division those two are enemies of each other the seed that was appointed oh frank can't we just see that seem to come forth was nothing more than the foretelling of jesus christ to come forward to be our redeemer to be our savior to bring us back from this fallen condition when they were kicked out of the garden of eden back to a place of redemption again back into full fellowship back into full redemption back to where man can receive revelation of god's word and god in man just like they did in the cool of the day oh wouldn't it have been wonderful he heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the gloom of the day would have been wonderful it was one of those days before the fall where they had that wonderful fellowship and communion together oh that's exactly what god's desire to store back he's just foretelling and he's showing us just a couple of verses later exactly what he's going to do how he's going to do it how he's going to bring it forth and how we're going to end up back in complete fellowship with him again how we can see that god took from adam and made a woman how we can see that adam fell and became sin so he could redeem that woman and so that we now that woman of jesus christ coming out of him as a representative as the word itself and be that uh and be that light that god has called for this last day not only that but then he come and live in his believer he come and live in us praise the lord oh my it's beautiful it's beautiful friend now but i've got to move on i will put enmity between the woman and i and the and between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head what the woman's seed christ shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel obviously satan is always on the hills of god always on the heels of jesus always trying to personate counterfeit pervert what god is creating what god has done satan is always trying to pervert that sometimes he'll pervert it with 99 of the truth but he's still perverted sometimes he'll pervert it just like he perverted it in the garden of eden just like he tried to pervert it to jesus christ by getting jesus to doubt who he was well if he's going to try to get jesus to doubt who he was if he got eve to deny who she was don't you think he's going to try to do that to you if you're a son or daughter of god today that's exactly what he's going to try to get you to doubt who you are oh my but that bruising of the heel he's always there amen but where is the head of the serpent where is the head of the devil under our feet senator jesus speaks he said thou shalt uh it shall bruise thy head so if he's if he's under under our feet if he's under jesus he's under our feet praise the lord because we're more than conquerors through him that loved us amen satan is under our feet and we're worried to death about clothing come on saints don't don't fear that devil is under our feet you have nothing to fear god is with us amen upon the woman now let's move on 16th verse upon the uh unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow now notice again he didn't curse the woman he just made adam her ruler but look unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire to be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now he didn't curse her he just said that adam was her ruler see and then she would and sorrow bring forth children but but he still gave her the incredible responsibility of bringing forth those children it's hard to imagine it it's actually a hard to imagine it's hard to explain and i've tried to do it several times it's hard to explain even understand the responsibility that god gave to the woman in bringing life into this world not only bringing life into this world responsibly correctly bringing children to this world but also the responsibility of raising those children and the nurture and admonition of god and people want to put women down and say this that you know friend humanity would cease to have existed thousands of years ago if god hadn't entrusted the woman with this responsibility it's powerful it's beautiful in my opinion amen that now but her desire now to her husband and she and he shall rule over thee not a curse now but now unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat a bit cursed is the ground not adam cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life now notice again he didn't curse adam he cursed the ground because of adam so that adam now has to live by the sweat of his brow to get his food and his earning and his living and of course if you've ever worked a day out in the arizona summer sun you'll know what it means to live by the sweat of your brow it's very hot but anyway it's it's absolutely scriptural that's exactly what god did and that's for that's where we are that's where we live also notice i've brought this out before that god said hast thou eaten the tree which i commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it now he didn't say that to eve which is another reason i believe adam told eve what god said because god never told the woman now did you do what i told you not to do he didn't say that he only told adam he didn't say that to the serpent he only told that to adam why because adam was his son god told his son what he wanted to get done and it was adam's responsibility to take care of it and to make sure it got done period god help us that's where we are today amen that's where we are today the society is the way it is because man hasn't took his position society is the way it is today because of the weak weakness behind pulpits and people don't stand on the word like they're supposed to and live by god's holy word you do it right it works you don't and it won't work it might feel better to you might look good in the politics and the world system but it's ungodly and it's not acceptable in god's eyes god didn't curse the man didn't curse the woman cursed the serpent but now the man is the only one he said i told you not to do this and you did it anyway notice now thorns also in thistles shall it bring forth unto thee and shall eat at the earth with the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for doubt dust thou art and to dust thou return notice 20th first now and adam called his wife's name eve now adam i've made this point before please give me a minute to make it again adam is now for the first time calling his wife eve why now why after all of this has happened i mean he's already named all the animals and plants and everything by now why did he not name her why when god created her and brought her forth from him he just called a woman from man he didn't call her evil he didn't give her a name until now until after the fall until after all this has happened because the definition of the word eve is the mother of all living never says he was the father of all living but she was the mother of all living why because there's seeds planted in her one from the serpent and one from adam and they're about to come forth in genesis chapter four cain and abel cain rose up of that wicked one and slew his brother notice that now that time where adam is calling her eve to differentiate her from him and to differentiate and to help understand where she was now because now she's pregnant with twins she's pregnant with two boys a canaan and abel one is from him one is from the serpent serpent seed understand serpent seed anybody says there's no serpent seed in the bible it just doesn't know their bible serpent seed now she's eve mother of all living adam not the father of all living let's continue because i want to get to 23rd 21st first and we'll finish this chapter unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them now we've got the appropriate sacrifice now we've got a sacrifice that's acceptable by god because it's god's sacrifice it was god's decision was god's choice it was god who made this an acceptable sacrifice that two lambs had to give their innocent lives and shed their blood so that adam and eve could come back out into the presence of god again not like it was because that blood only covered the sin it did not annihilate it had to take the creative blood of god in the in in the person of jesus christ the word became flesh to bleed and so that bleeding word could then cover or not cover annihilate the sin so that the sin no longer exists in the mind of god to those who receive that redemptive plan amen is that simple but this could not do it this this blood sacrifice of these only allowed them to come out into god's presence only allow them to come to a place where uh they could uh they could be in god's presence again but then god still kicked him out he didn't come out in the cool of the day anymore he kicked them out of the garden of eden put the cherubims there the flaming swords to guard it and keep her keep them from it now i want to read a couple of things to reiterate this to solidify this if you will bring this uh into a little little circle now christ and mystery god revealed um uh let's see here god himself uh to take the penalty of his own law death to die to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him praise the lord let's read that again god himself god himself again not a second person third person not some great man some pro great prophet somebody that they learned in the seminary or from of the bible but god god himself to take the penalty of his own law death to die now that penalty was just given as we read by those two lambs it was acceptable by god why was it acceptable because there had to be a blood sacrifice to meet the blood sin amen to die to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him when eve went away from the word she went away from her mate the word and her mate amen notice in the in the beginning we talked about god created the heaven and the earth wealth was out form and void and the spirit of god moved out upon the face of the water remember in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word logos that is god logos the word is god it's the existence of of god the word that word then became flesh and dwelt among us as we read last week but now when eve went away from the word she went away from her mate why was that her word for that day see because remember uh i believe it's uh peter talks about being established in the present day truth so there's a present day truth of the slowly unfolding mysteries of god bringing himself down to a place to reveal himself to his people in a capacity that we could receive it understand it by revelation not by knowledge but by revelation i have to be a theologian you know don't have to have some great education to know what this is to know who this is amen this is god but now when she went away from the words she went away from her mate what was her mate her mate was the word how was he the word he wasn't the word in the sense that jesus was he wasn't the word in the sense that the spirit of god moved out because this man was a creation of god but he was the word to her the present-day truth to her in the sense that uh what god directives and word was he gave to adam and when he gave that word to adam and then created from him her that made him the word to her because god didn't directly give that word to her he gave it to adam and it was adam's responsibility to give that word to her so when she left him she left the word because he was that word to her understand when she went away from the words she went away from me and when the church the bride i'll say goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornication with the world of man's wisdom rejecting the authority of god's word now you see here how the bride today even though there's males like myself a part of that bride is in its designation feminish because we are bride to him to god the eternal one who in god what from the beginning was both male and female he was everything everything that's ever been existed manifested in the world today man woman children and animals body that was in god it's all in god to start with see so the designation of that to us today as bride is is in its feminist form just because of the type of god himself jehovah having a bride a helpmate a a companion see that's why he likes to talk and fellowship and and and have fellowship with him with us that's why we should take that time and have that fellowship with the lord he meant to have that time with god had that intimate relationship at that time that there's a fellowship there's a communion it's not just an inherent boy it's not just a supplication god give me give me give me no it's a relationship if you have a true good relationship with anybody friend it's not it's not a give a give a gift it's a relationship it's both ways it's love it's compassion it's it's giving it's uh being given that's the way that's the way it is amen but when when the bride goes away from the word to a denomination which obviously saying here the word is not dwell in denominations she rejects commits fornication against uh with the world of men's wisdom rejecting god's authority she's rejecting god she's rejected the word she's gone to some hybridism to some man-made idea or opinion of it instead of the true revelation of the word a lot of people are doing that today a lot of people are standing right in the midst of what they call themselves message and have entered into a denomination they've entered into a denomination saying that they're in the message no the message isn't denominated but people have denominated themselves inside this message and unfortunately a lot of times people have used and and portrayed the word message basically in the same context as baptist and methodist and pentecostals do what's the difference i beg to ask you what's the difference it's not a covering friend god didn't send a prophet a messenger to make this some kind of a covering some kind of a religion something that you can soothe your savage conscience by this is something to bring us into a relationship with jesus christ that we have one-on-one communion and fellowship with him daily daily you can't do it unless god has come himself and revealed himself to you made himself known and opened himself so that you can see that a revelation praise the lord god give us that communion that fellowship we need now to follow up this last scripture and show us the father this is june 1953 and could you imagine god throwing back in them uh throwing back in them bushes they're an old pair of bloody sheepskin here come the most beautiful woman ever lived in the face of the earth wrapped up her blonde hair hanging down her back like this didn't even know she was naked before this old bloody sheepskin around her the blood running down her uh and the beautiful woman that she was could you imagine coming out into the presence of god and that old sheepskin slapping their legs as they walk out into the presence of god kind of had a ring to it i imagine a ring that god was more pleased with than the condition they were before can you imagine just like he set the priesthood up when he had to make their garments and had to put the bells and the pomegranates around the bottom you know when they come into the presence of god when the high priest come behind into the holies of holies it had to ring out holy holy holy lord god almighty there had to be a reign to that that was pleasing to the lord because it was something that was according to god's word it was something that was pleasing to god it was because it was a directive of god they obeyed the word this was a directive of god this was the sheep that god had killed and had given to them and those sheep skins slapping their legs had to just be music to god it was a horrible sound obviously it was a bloody mess that adam the most beautiful handsome man of eve the most beautiful woman walked out into his presence again with this bloody mess but it was what was pleasing to the lord the revelation of that was obtained by abel so by faith hebrews 11 abel was off to offer unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain cain was of the wicked one cain was of the serpent seed amen abel was of god god seed god's lineage to receive revelation to see what the truth of it was that when they walked out and that certain music played as that sheepskin slapped against their legs was something that was acceptable to god oh it looked horrible to humans it looked hoy can you imagine how horrible it would have looked can you imagine the kind of ridicule that would be today the ridicule that those who do follow the word get today the people that desire to live a holy godly life the people that decide to live by the word of god and accept god's word as their absolute in the ridicule that they get today the ridicule that comes their way but people wanting to uh make it any kind of a thing they want to by man's denomination of man-made ideas friend there's only one way to god and that's by his word that's by obedience in his word it's the only way that you're going to be pleasing to god that's how it was pleasing to god here that music that sound that was going as they were walking forth out from behind those bushes with that sheepskin slapping that blood splattering everywhere it was music to god it was acceptable to god because it was god's way now if you don't like god's way you need to talk to god about that you don't talk to the preacher pastor you talk to god you don't like the way god's word is you don't like god's ways you need to talk to god about that you need to go to him and tell him that you've got a better idea go to god and tell them you've got a better plan you think there's a better way of doing it you go ahead and do that go ahead and see how far you get i would say good luck but i don't believe in luck amen let's go on and um turn over to hebrews hebrews chapter 6. look at hebrews chapter six maybe i have time a few more minutes please to get uh get through this little bit that i want to do here now uh hebrews chapter six and uh and get to this place now of course uh we obviously realized as i went to this point that that those bloody sheepskin those innocent lambs was nothing more than a type of jesus the sacrifice that god gave there those those lambs that he created that god had formed the the their bloody sheepskins that was the sacrifice give there was just a representation of for thought for knowledge foreshadow of what god was going to do with his only son jesus jesus was going to come then to be the sacrificial lamb the absolute amen the finish of it so that sacrifice basically again was just a foretelling of jesus christ now let's find another unfolding that was there's a couple point more points i wanted to make probably i'm probably not going to get to them today i apologize but hebrews chapter 6 verse 20 whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest after for forever after the order of melchizedek now melchizedek if you go back into genesis you'll see with abraham melchizedek came to abraham after the slaughter of the king where he went to rescue lot and adam abraham came forth uh victoriously and melchizedek met him there on the road melchizedek brought wine and bread to have communion that communion and fellowship there with his victorious son was nothing more than a symbolic gesture of the partaking of we have of his body and blood today the symbol of the communion the symbol of the lord's supper well it was here that melchizedek came and met abraham there after that slaughter of the kings melchizedek uh eludes a lot of theologians and bible scholars today they still can't understand or grasp who milk hesitate was he's a person priesthood they can't believe he's a person but if you understand again the condescension of god and god unfolding himself down the creation of god being able to or i say creation of god that might not be the right way to put it but the creation of this of this melchizedek uh was was in a word body or we call a theophany a theophany body compared disappeared he appeared there with abraham and let's read and we can see how the definition the explanation melchizedek is here because jesus again 20th verse made it high priest forever after the order of melchizedek so there had to be a significance to this melchizedek from back in genesis for god to write in here or make jesus that high priest forever after that order of melchizedek look now seventh chapter first first for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part now who would this melchizedek be now you can go back and listen to the message who is this melchizedek which i would highly recommend tremendous message in its own right but who is this melchizedek would be the question that i would have who is this melchizedek well first of all we know he was king of salem which is king of righteousness or king of peace salem is peace he is the king of righteousness king of salem which is king of peace and abraham gave a tenth part of all so abraham tithed to melchizedek now look friend scripturally there's only one that is to receive tithing and that's god god is the only one that receives tightening of his people god is the one that gets that it's not a man it's not an entity it's not even a priesthood god just made them stewards of his tithing that's all that's almost the priesthood is the ministry is nothing more than stewards of god's money that's just the way god made it but the tithing is god's that goes to god that's god's money god determines what happens to that see and he gives in his word what it does so when abraham's giving him tithing obviously abraham knew who he was he was the great elohim the great one that had been talking to him this whole time and speaking to abraham and telling him to separate himself and to get out from among his family and to go to a land that he was to show him see abraham recognized that he knew that in this melchizedek he's just seeing it in a bodily form now it's not the body that was jesus but jesus but this logos melchizedek theophany became jesus because it's the self-same god when you chop god up into three four five ten pieces then you've got a mess if you try to follow it with the bible but if you realize the truth of this godhead christ being that mystery of god revealed it becomes very plain and you see this melchizedek he's the king of rice's king of satan which is king of peace the priest is the most high god forever abraham gave a tenth part of all abraham wouldn't give just anybody god's money amen you don't give just anybody god's money if you want to buy an old lady a set of tires do it with your own money that's god's money you give god's money his money it's his see abraham gave it to him god abraham would god's god's prophet god's word prophet would have given god's money to anybody to all first being by interpretation because again he's the priest of the most high god first being my interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent now who is that who is that has ever not had a father mother or without descent who there's only one there's one eternal infinite and that's god god is the only one that's eternal god's the only one that is infinite god is the only one that is the elohim self-existing without father without mother without the sin no having neither beginning of days nor end of life how does that fit any man it it can't it has to be god praise the lord but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually the continual priest now fourth first now consider how great this man now if you look in your bible you'll see an asterisk or a blocked off word most of them will especially if you have a king james or old king james mine's italicized the word was was italicized now i'm sure most of you know this but if you see an italicized word like that in the bible or one that's blocked off not necessarily parentheses but blocked off those words were added they're not a part of the original greek or hebrew text they're added to try to help with the flow of reading the bible see so when you read this you say now consider how great this man was see so it's supposed to help with the flow but the word was is not a part of the original text so let's take that word out i don't mean to take from the word but again that word was added that word's not a part of the original text it was added for flow for for reading flow so now if you take that word was out which was not a part of the original text and say now consider how great this man or we could say is they have was this man is not a was he is an is he can appear disappear be anywhere anytime he wants to he can come in theophany form he can come in the form of another man he can come in a cloud oh in a cloud really you mean god can come in a cloud even like a circular cloud with angels and he can come in a cloud well how do you think he came to the children of israel he came to the children of israel by day in a cloud he came to them at night in a pillar of fire how do you think he came to saul saul looked up and what did he see a cloud oh mercy people help us lord revelation makes everything simple doesn't it he came in a cloud saul looked up and said who art thou lord lord elohim he said i am jesus a voice spoke out of the cloud and said i am jesus who you are persecuting or was he he wasn't clouded this man is not a was he is an is he is a always continually existing never began never ended god almighty in theophany form of melchizedek who then came into the form of flesh jesus christ why did he have to come in the form of jesus christ in the flesh you said well he was flesh there was theophany body when he come and met abraham before he sent the angels down to sodom and gomorrah what he brought he ate he came and had communion with abraham he had bread and wine he came there with abraham in the the tent and he sat there and and sarah cooked in food he ate food he ate and drank in this theophany so what was the point of that creation of god coming in in the womb of a woman because jesus had to become a kinsmen to fulfill the scripture he had to become a kinsmen to be able to redeem those that are of the flesh he had to come in the flesh the kinsmen human flesh to redeem those that were in human flesh the redemption of jesus the only way for him to be a kinsman was to become like us in the form of sinful flesh in the likeness of sinful flesh he had to come that way but first god's condem sending him showing himself all along god came in a burning push to moses he also came when he hid out he had most in the clapton rock covered his eyes and he saw the higher part of a man come in the world went to job he said well god can only do this this everybody wants to box god into things and say well you can't do this god well you can't do that god but that can't be god praying god can do anything he wants he can be anywhere anytime to anybody he wants to it's his chosen that's his decision and there he come in the form of melchizedek without father without mother without descent either having beginning of days or end of life but made like to the son of god about this preacher continually now consider how great this man not was this man he's not a used to be he is a perpetual continuance existence of now he is unto whom even the patriarch abram gave abraham gave a tenth of the spoils and verily they that are the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham blessed him that he uh that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed the better and here men that died received tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness that he liveth and so i may say so say levi also we receive tithes aid tithes in abraham for it was yet the laws of his father when melchizedek met him he was this melchizedek this melchizedek is nothing more than the logos that came out in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the word was made flesh it's that same spirit that is god that come forth that god had met and had fellowship now when when those three angels came to abraham abraham fell on his face and said my lord there's three men standing in front of him but he says my lord singular why because he's only addressing the one in the middle he's only addressing the one that became in the middle at calvary he's only addressing the elohim the self-existing god almighty you say well how could that be god abraham said it was he said that can't be god abraham said it was he said lord my elohim lord he didn't address the other two michael gabriel whoever god blew dust out and said hey michael stand in this blue dust gabriel sent in this and he walks up and the three of them walk up there because the two are getting ready to go to sodom and gomorrah and he says my lord singular because he's only addressing the one he's not addressing the other two he's addressing that one that he had been talking to that had been talking to him this whole time the one that came to him and that and that theophy of melchizedek that priesthood that melchizedek priesthood that's only the idea of don't get messed up in the verbiage friend it's only the that office it's only that part that was being played my wish my time is up now i got to close but lord really next week we'll get to that part where we understand where these parts come in where these offices are played how they're played how god unfolds himself so that we can see that and and realize who it is abraham knew who it was that's why he said my lord locke didn't know who it was because when the two angels came to him he said my lord's plural of course the main one god did not go down to sodom and gomorrah even though he says i am going to go well when god went he sent his angels down there to check it out to see amen but it was still god revealing himself it was still god unfolding himself it was still god manifesting himself so we could see in that who he is amen i have a quote i wanted to read here i'm going to say that for next week it's a little bit lengthy so we can pick this up and finish that off and get into that part that i really want to get to today but we can recognize then who who he is and the revelation of who he is and how the scripture is so perfect and unfolding it to us and uh seeing that and seeing him in there and it really revealed to us it becomes really dare as i say plain simple because it doesn't take a theologian to understand it it just takes the holy spirit in revelation to be able to understand it to be able to grasp it and let god reveal it to you so that we become it becomes a part of us because that's who we are amen so just lord really hang on to that at that end we'll stop there with the milk hesitate and try to pick it up there at the end of milk has a dig then and get down into the flesh of jesus and and hopefully bring into the preeminence of that in the body of believers today that's where we are amen expecting and praying and hoping to be that that preeminence that god has in in his body of believers today and we're the embodiment of jesus christ and that he reveals himself in and through us so god bless you today uh i mentioned to you i pray something will say the blessing strength here today uh i meant i mentioned to you that i wanted to talk to you just for a moment uh about the building we've done a lot of work brother roger and i appreciate so much uh the ones that were able to come over uh friday and be a part of the help and the cleanup god bless those who had in your heart to come and just couldn't for some reason god bless you understand that of course but i do appreciate those that were able to come special shout out to my grandson mike uh joel uh excuse me there joel who done a wonderful job helping him really was a big help to me and brother john roger um i appreciated him his help so much he was just just a big boy there and um did a lot of work for us and um i appreciate them so much but we've got the church all cleared out it's one big room now but when they had built a ceiling in below the original ceiling the original the original ceiling is about eight inches higher than uh the existing current ceiling uh that's up they built it down and they built it on some of the four by sixes that were holding the walls up was holding the ceiling up so and taking some of those down the ceiling kind of started to come down found out that the wiring which we're going to have to completely redo was all above the second ceiling which would have cut into the primary ceiling secondary ceiling just to get to to try to fix um uh we just decided we're just gonna and not to mention we need to put new lighting and stuff in we're just gonna take the whole ceiling down new ceiling old ceiling uh just up to the rafters uh me and brother rogers gonna get some people this week to do that they're gonna bring it all down and haul it all off for us and then we're gonna start fresh we're gonna put our air ducting in how and where we want it and our lighting how and where we want it have a drop ceiling and uh get it painted look really good it should be a beautiful place float out the floor and uh lord willing to put some carpet down and it should be a really beautiful place that being said our intention is to try to have live church services there next sunday there's a lot to do between now and next sunday so if we're not able to i'll certainly let you know and keep you abreast of what's going on that we may have to do it the following we may have to start our first service the following sunday which should be august 9th uh before we do that but we're just trusting believing if everything goes uh like we're hoping to and uh there's quite a bit of cost involved uh to get this like this and the place that we can use it the way we'd like to and stuff so uh lord willing is again the intention is to have our first service next sunday there remember it is at 2544 north country club it's just north of grant on country club on the east side of the road so if you've never been there it's mike behar's old insurance office it's a nice place you really like it it's it's uh it's it's its own building there's nothing attached to it there's parking in the back there's gates on the side and the front so but just bear with us and let you know that's what's going on hopefully sister did a great job cleaning it up to uh going to get dirty again but we can clean it up again and it won't be as hard to clean up because you cleaned up the first time you know if you're having to clean up clean up uh it's a little easier than cleaning up the dirty dirty uh the cleaner it is when you go to clean it the easier it is to clean the dirtier it is when you go to clean it the harder it is to clean so you've already cleaned it so praise the lord it should be should be good and um and get it to where it's usable for us it may not be exactly what we want it to be in fact it probably is not likely going to be exactly like we want it to be when we have our first service but it'll be sufficient to have the service so just remember that we love you appreciate you and uh just be praying for that and trusting the lord just continue to supply that for us and god's just been good to us from this thing was just want to tell you sometimes it's just this i'll tell everybody the whole story but this was just dropped in our laps we weren't looking for this oh we were looking for things but uh you know another place to go but this just just chopped in our lamps i'll tell you the story of the lord well and some of you know but anyway so uh just be in prayer about that and just uh well and i will let you know and keep you abreast of what the plans are for next sunday so i appreciate you being here appreciate you being part of the service today i pray something was said to bless and strengthen you today let's just depart if we could once again with the word of prayer precious jesus lord we thank you so much father for your precious word we thank you so much for the revelation of that word we thank you for a prophet that come to bring that word to a bride for this last day to bring a present-day truth that we now god could be established in because of the forethought and the moving of your spirit god to have them recorded and to put them on tapes and books and ways that we could listen and read god i'm so thankful father for your word because that's who you are you are the word you became flesh dwelt among us and you're still here today you're not a was
