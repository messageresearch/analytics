[34:09] from the wise and prudent and has
[34:11] revealed them unto B praise the Lord you
[34:14] could be seated if you'd
[34:16] like amen want to go back over to
[34:18] Revelation chapter 6 where we left over
[34:20] last week uh I'm not going to go back to
[34:23] the others that we have read but we do
[34:25] want to keep in our hearts because it
[34:26] will continue to flow through this uh
[34:30] probably as I was looking at it and
[34:31] studying it on it this week uh probably
[34:34] another two more services on this one uh
[34:37] topic of false teachers amen praise the
[34:42] Lord this is God Simplicity part seven
[34:46] amen false teachers part
[34:48] two amen so just keep in mind as we have
[34:51] read those scriptures uh for the past
[34:54] couple of weeks in Isaiah over
[34:56] revelation 19 about that sharp sword
[34:59] going out of the mouth of the Lord as we
[35:02] know of and identified and we can see
[35:04] plainly in the scripture simply means
[35:07] the word of God Amen the word of God the
[35:09] sharp powerful sword that cuts coming
[35:12] and going that that that is the word of
[35:15] God the same uh word of God the same uh
[35:19] sword that uh that gives the believer
[35:22] blessing and hope and and and all the
[35:25] the things that all the bless the
[35:27] benefits of God we have amen it's the
[35:29] same thing that is the cursing to those
[35:31] who do not believe to those who reject
[35:33] it amen and you can see that in
[35:36] plentiful uh in the world today we ended
[35:38] off on Revelation chapter 6 I want to go
[35:41] back there again we ran we read kind of
[35:44] read through the uh the uh the seals the
[35:47] other day and seeing in this and trying
[35:51] to identify finding in the
[35:53] identification of the scripture where
[35:56] the auth authority of these false
[35:57] teachers comes from where do they get
[36:00] the authority to bring false teaching
[36:04] amen we found out as we read through and
[36:07] I'll just read through without
[36:08] commentary maybe just one more
[36:10] time as we're Revelation chapter 6 verse
[36:14] one and I saw when the lamb had opened
[36:17] one of the seals and I heard as it were
[36:19] the noise of Thunder one of the four
[36:21] bees saying come and see and I saw and
[36:24] behold a white horse and he that sat on
[36:27] him had a bow and a crown was given unto
[36:30] him and he went forth conquering and to
[36:32] conquer the crown was given him amen
[36:35] didn't earn it didn't inherit didn't
[36:37] deserve it it was given to him amen now
[36:40] and when he had opened the second seal I
[36:42] heard the second be say come and see
[36:44] then went on another horse that was red
[36:46] and power was given to him again not
[36:49] earned not deserved but given to him
[36:52] power was given to him that set there
[36:54] thereon to take peace from the earth and
[36:58] that they should kill one another and
[37:00] there was also given unto him a great
[37:04] sword amen a great sword was given unto
[37:07] him we recognize that obviously as he's
[37:09] coming into the church as we talked
[37:12] about last week and he's infiltrating
[37:14] into the birth of that true church that
[37:16] began on Pentecost and he began to to
[37:19] bring forth through the crown and the
[37:22] authority and then the power the word
[37:25] amen he had authority to bring the word
[37:29] the the sword that was given to him amen
[37:32] notice this word is not withheld from
[37:35] anyone but the truth of this word the
[37:38] revelation of this word is withheld from
[37:41] those that do not believe will not
[37:44] believe amen and those that come to
[37:47] believe those that are given to them by
[37:51] this sword by this uh by this riter
[37:55] through the ones that he's been been
[37:56] able to work in down through time as he
[37:59] still has subjects that he can work
[38:01] through today it may not be as like it
[38:03] was the Catholic Church down to the
[38:05] church ages but he always has someone
[38:09] some group people ministers Amen to work
[38:13] through and he's still working today but
[38:16] his working is with this sword amen he's
[38:20] taking what he's been given and he's
[38:22] using it praise the Lord given unto him
[38:25] a sword one deserve wasn't earned none
[38:28] of that was given to him amen why was it
[38:31] given to him God is God had a purpose to
[38:34] established on this Earth and again as
[38:36] we said and as we quoted brother brandom
[38:39] you realize that that seed that was
[38:41] birthed forth there had to go into the
[38:43] ground it had to die and it had to rot
[38:46] before it could birth forth again a new
[38:48] bringing into this last day this last
[38:52] age this last time the end of the last
[38:55] age amen and all that the Satan had done
[38:59] through that time was to be exposed in
[39:02] this last day we talked about we'll get
[39:05] into the scripture in a minute uh so
[39:07] I'll probably reiterate it in a little
[39:09] more when we actually read it in the
[39:11] scripture but that time where it was
[39:13] where it was told to Daniel uh by God it
[39:16] was told to John the Revelator in
[39:18] Revelation 10 by God seal that up
[39:21] because it wasn't time amen well friend
[39:24] uh now is the time amen the revelation
[39:27] of that has been he has been exposed to
[39:30] who he was down Through the Ages as
[39:33] they've read this even up to the time
[39:36] that God showed this in 1963 to the
[39:39] prophet of God people still believe that
[39:42] that was Jesus riding white horse red
[39:44] horse black horse now that he's been
[39:46] exposed we know better it's the workings
[39:49] of the devil it's the workings of Satan
[39:52] amen Jesus did not have to have a crown
[39:56] given to him he did not have to have
[40:00] power given to him he did not have to
[40:02] have a sword given to him these were all
[40:06] of his possessions praise God because he
[40:09] was God built in flesh amen do you
[40:12] understand so it just further exposes
[40:15] the enemy amen down through time down
[40:18] through the church ages he is now been
[40:20] exposed we can and see that through the
[40:23] revelation of this word when he open the
[40:26] third seal I heard the third Beast say
[40:29] come and see and I beheld L A Black
[40:32] Horse He that on him had a pair of
[40:33] balances we talked about that in his
[40:35] hand I Heard a Voice a voice in the
[40:37] midst of the four beasts remember that's
[40:39] Jesus speaking out brother R Mak very
[40:41] clearly to understand that Jesus is the
[40:44] only one we went back to Revelation read
[40:46] there that Jesus the only one that had
[40:49] the authority to be able to speak as
[40:51] such to command that Spirit to be able
[40:55] to go and not go do and not do we talked
[40:58] about Job how God allowed job to do
[41:01] certain things but put limitations on it
[41:05] uh first it was job then it was don't
[41:08] take job's life you can touch job but
[41:09] don't take his life it was God giving
[41:11] him the ability to let him loose but
[41:14] with
[41:15] limitations this limitation here was
[41:18] when that voice went forth same one same
[41:21] God that told him up in heaven that he
[41:23] could have job same God given in that
[41:27] Authority here but then he tells him a
[41:29] measure week for a penny three measures
[41:31] of barley you weigh out the wealth of
[41:33] the world the Catholic Church the
[41:34] wealthiest organization on the planet
[41:37] but see thou hurt not my anointed see
[41:41] thou hurt not my oil and wine and we
[41:43] notice that's not a physical hurt
[41:46] hurting that's not the thing that God
[41:49] focuses on I
[41:51] I God blesses us friends God heals us
[41:55] God protects us God watches over us but
[41:57] it's not the physical thing it's the
[41:59] spiritual thing that God's concerned
[42:01] about the most our spiritual well-being
[42:04] amen and what is what his Proclamation
[42:07] don't you dare cause them to do those
[42:09] Hill Maries and things don't you dare
[42:12] cause them to commit spiritual
[42:14] fornication Against The God Who is her
[42:17] husband right amen leave her alone
[42:20] hallelujah praise the Lord none of these
[42:23] things when it opened the foral I heard
[42:25] the voice of the for Beast saying come
[42:27] and see and I looked and behold a Pale
[42:29] Horse and his name it set on him was
[42:31] death and Hell Followed With Him and
[42:33] power was given unto them over the
[42:37] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[42:39] the sword to kill with what the
[42:42] sword not a literal sword right amen but
[42:46] deception it was given to them to do so
[42:51] it was given unto
[42:53] this white red black now pale hor riter
[42:56] to do so the authority the power the
[43:00] sword to be able to do it was given by
[43:04] God so all this that takes place around
[43:07] the world and the questioning of of of
[43:10] of how can these uh the false teachers
[43:14] false prophets continue to move forward
[43:17] and and still continue to bring forth
[43:21] their their their uh damnable teachings
[43:24] how are they able to do it because
[43:26] they've been given the authority to do
[43:27] it right God gave them the authority and
[43:30] they still have that Authority today
[43:33] that Authority has not been revoked and
[43:35] it will be in place now
[43:38] see it's there all not not only to
[43:42] separate those that will miss don't
[43:44] believe but it's also there to test
[43:46] those that do believe
[43:49] right is there to test us on the true
[43:52] word are we going to believe the true
[43:55] real word are we going to let other
[43:57] things draw us other things take our
[44:00] attention other things uh uh uh draw us
[44:04] away from the true pure Holiness uh of
[44:07] the unadulterated word it's a test amen
[44:12] look
[44:14] now um let's continue power was given to
[44:17] them over the fourth part of the earth
[44:19] to kill with the sword so we can know
[44:23] that that is a spiritual death
[44:26] not a physical death a spiritual death
[44:29] because the sword that we're speaking of
[44:31] that we know of that we've read all the
[44:33] way through the word being the word of
[44:36] God was given to
[44:39] kill so this is a spiritual death not a
[44:42] physical death right to kill a and to
[44:46] kill with Hunger so we got a spiritual
[44:49] death we've got a hunger because
[44:52] remember the scripture says there will
[44:54] be a time when well there will be a
[44:56] famine in the land yes but not a famine
[44:59] of bread and water but a famine Famine
[45:02] of hearing of the pure unadulterated
[45:05] word of God Amen a famine yes people
[45:09] starving people uh hungry for the word
[45:13] of God people wanting that word in their
[45:16] hearts striving in their hearts to want
[45:19] to hear a pure unadulterated word to to
[45:23] to see a real God moving in a amongst
[45:26] the people amen there'll be a hunger we
[45:29] see it today yes the hunger is just as
[45:31] real today as we know cuz this is that
[45:34] last time because this pale horse rider
[45:36] rides on into predition it goes through
[45:39] this age it goes after the bride is gone
[45:41] and continues on even after the bride is
[45:43] gone and taken home it continues on
[45:47] right amen and it continues on doing the
[45:50] exact same thing that it has always done
[45:54] thank God that that it would be so close
[45:57] it would deceive the very elect now so
[46:00] close but it cannot deceive the very
[46:03] elect right impossible for the elect to
[46:06] be deceived because she has become the
[46:09] word and it's impossible to deceive the
[46:12] word with the word yes amen amen amen so
[46:17] they kill them with the sword and with
[46:20] Hunger the famine and with death and
[46:24] with the Beast of the earth now you see
[46:26] there's a great now there's probably
[46:28] maybe I don't know I haven't looked at
[46:30] statistics lately but as much or more
[46:34] people
[46:35] filling uh uh Christian churches around
[46:39] the world than there's maybe ever been
[46:41] amen probably of course in the United
[46:43] States even though you see the the
[46:45] anti-christian move going on you see a
[46:47] lot of the biggest churches ever
[46:50] assembled 10 20 30,000 members in this
[46:54] country ass assembled buying stadiums uh
[46:59] uh sports stadiums to be able to seat
[47:01] everybody there's so many of them and
[47:04] even with and even with a sports Stadium
[47:07] they still have to have two and three
[47:08] services every day just to have all the
[47:11] people filtered in and out amen more
[47:13] than ever but what does that
[47:16] mean that just means there's more death
[47:20] right when the pure word of God is not
[47:22] there not presented not uh preached then
[47:25] what do you have you have death yeah
[47:28] amen amen that's why Jesus cried out
[47:31] Revelation 18 come out of her my people
[47:35] do not be partaker of her sin what is
[47:38] her sin her sin is unbelief yes sin
[47:41] means to miss the mark what is missing
[47:43] the mark unbelief of the word of God and
[47:47] Jesus God cried out come out of her to
[47:50] be not partaker of that death that's why
[47:54] the bride is separate that's that's why
[47:56] she's been called out that's why she's
[47:58] an elected Group by God handpicked and
[48:01] Jesus said no man can take them out of
[48:04] my
[48:05] hand praise the Lord if they are
[48:08] predestined of God and they're Ed in the
[48:10] palm of God's hand nobody can take them
[48:13] out praise God praise the Lord Jesus I
[48:16] don't care what the circumstances look
[48:18] like I don't care where they are I don't
[48:20] care if they haven't darkened the door
[48:22] of a church in 30 years that makes no
[48:25] difference that all right they're still
[48:27] in the palm of Jesus hand and no one not
[48:30] even the devil can pluck them out amen
[48:33] praise God yes now you see where this
[48:35] death comes from it comes from false
[48:38] teaching amen false teaching of the word
[48:41] that they have been given they've been
[48:44] given the word to be able to do that
[48:46] with the authority doesn't come from
[48:49] their Seminary The Authority does not
[48:51] come from their denomination The
[48:54] Authority does not come from the those
[48:55] who sit and listen their Authority
[48:58] literally comes from God who gave it to
[49:01] them and allowed it to be so right and
[49:04] God allows it to be so today amen but
[49:08] thank God the bride cannot be deceived
[49:11] amen she cannot be deceived now I want
[49:14] to go over to Revelation uh to uh 2
[49:21] Thessalonians and I want to I want to
[49:24] get through this and this will probably
[49:26] take the rest of the service and then
[49:27] next
[49:28] week uh I want to get and make it very
[49:32] personal I'll just tell you Saints next
[49:35] Sunday the Lord willing will be very
[49:38] personal I'm not going to call names or
[49:41] anything like that like brother Brown
[49:43] talked about or like Paul did in the
[49:45] scripture No it's none of that it's just
[49:47] finding
[49:48] out looking out here
[49:51] today whom of you feel like you could be
[49:55] deceived Deed by the Catholic church
[49:58] today whom of you think you could even
[50:01] be deceived by the Baptist church today
[50:03] or
[50:06] denomination then where's the
[50:09] deception it's not out there amen next
[50:13] week it'll get very personal 2
[50:15] Thessalonians chapter 2 I want to begin
[50:17] reading at verse
[50:21] one amen Revelation uh 2 Thessalonians
[50:25] chap 2
[50:27] ver1 now we beseech you Brethren by the
[50:29] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[50:31] our gathering together unto him now look
[50:34] at this exhortation that Paul gives this
[50:36] is extremely
[50:38] important that you be not soon shaken in
[50:43] mind or be
[50:45] troubled neither by Spirit nor by
[50:50] word nor by letter now the word and
[50:53] letter may sound like the same thing but
[50:55] it is not amen it's literal Spirit God
[51:00] logos amen and Rama letter word praise
[51:05] the Lord Paul's saying do not be
[51:08] deceived in any manner don't be trouble
[51:11] don't be troubled in your spirit don't
[51:14] let anyone deceive You by word or by
[51:17] letter amen by lost by word by Rama
[51:21] don't let don't let you be deceived
[51:24] don't be troubled about it amen and I
[51:27] say that so many times and I've heard
[51:28] and seen so many people uh that that has
[51:32] has caused that people begin to fret and
[51:35] wonder and worry over certain things
[51:38] even certain
[51:39] people ask me questions well so and so
[51:42] said such and such I said I I cannot
[51:44] vouch for that person's Revelation all I
[51:47] can do is preach what God gave to me
[51:50] that is why amen that is why God only
[51:54] called One Pastor to Pastor
[51:58] over people a person a group yes amen
[52:03] God did not ordain six pastors to Pastor
[52:07] that one person he didn't do it you find
[52:10] me in the scripture anywhere where God
[52:13] ever said that or where brother randam
[52:15] says it he's brother Ram says stand by
[52:18] your pastor singular yes but now you got
[52:22] today you can go on and listen on line
[52:25] and you can hear this one and that one
[52:27] you can hear us amen but I try to tell
[52:30] people look it's like brother ROM said
[52:33] he said brother if you don't believe
[52:35] this if you don't want your congregation
[52:38] then then then this is not for you this
[52:40] is for my church this is for my people
[52:44] and I'd say the same thing amen if
[52:46] somebody listens somebody watches this
[52:48] is for the group that calls me Pastor
[52:50] amen not another brother Pastor not
[52:53] somebody else in the city somebody comes
[52:55] listen to this and and listen to
[52:57] somebody else and say well is that your
[52:59] pastor amen I had someone in Florida
[53:02] that that was like I said well if that's
[53:04] your pastor then you need to move there
[53:06] and support that group with your TI and
[53:09] attendance right am amen well there's so
[53:13] and so and such I said you come up with
[53:14] all kind of excuses you want but if
[53:16] God's called that person to be your
[53:17] pastor you need to go support them you
[53:19] need to go support that church you need
[53:20] to attend that church give your tithe
[53:23] amen tithe and offering cuz that's how
[53:24] you support church that's how brother B
[53:26] said you support a church amen he said
[53:29] your tithe offering in attendance yes
[53:32] it's that simple but God did not ordain
[53:36] for any one of us to have four five six
[53:41] pastors he's only called one amen amen
[53:44] one to be your pastor now it's not now
[53:46] this doesn't mean that you don't listen
[53:48] to other ministers I'm not saying that
[53:50] I'm not trying to niiz this at all uh
[53:53] you any of us is more than welcome to
[53:56] any but you don't take the word of
[53:58] someone that you hear as a minister or
[54:00] something that somebody recommended and
[54:01] say you should listen to this message
[54:03] that doesn't that doesn't mean that
[54:05] person's your pastor amen and I've had
[54:08] people come in question and say well
[54:10] what about this and what about that you
[54:12] know you can only go into the word of
[54:14] God and all I can say a lot of times is
[54:16] I can't vouch for that brother's
[54:17] Revelation I can only vouch for what the
[54:19] Lord has showed me am I can only preach
[54:22] what God's given me yeah that's all I
[54:24] can preach that's all I know it's all
[54:26] I'm going to preach anyway I could
[54:27] probably preach more than that but I'm
[54:30] I'm only going to preach I learn my
[54:31] lesson I told y'all that on that I'm
[54:33] only going to preach what the Lord puts
[54:34] in my heart to preach right amen and
[54:37] that's it praise the Lord and if that
[54:40] and if God calls you to somebody else
[54:43] and that's between you and him amen
[54:47] that's between you and him praise the
[54:48] Lord but now don't be troubled see by
[54:51] word or letter cuz you know as we have
[54:54] read
[54:56] that there was many men in this day that
[55:01] were bringing false
[55:03] Doctrine they were trying to deny Jesus
[55:06] Christ how do you do that by denying the
[55:09] word and they were trying to preach a
[55:11] different gospel to people and they were
[55:14] trying to twist the words of truth that
[55:16] have been revealed to Peter Paul the
[55:18] disciples they were trying to trst twist
[55:21] those words and Paul called them people
[55:23] out he called a few out anyway by
[55:26] name and said these people are preaching
[55:29] false Doctrine they're causing people to
[55:33] go astray and believe something that's
[55:35] not
[55:36] true
[55:38] amen and those are people that become
[55:41] troubled now now Paul is saying but
[55:43] don't be
[55:45] troubled we've told you the truth I've
[55:47] preached you the truth I've demonstrated
[55:50] to you the truth what else can I do amen
[55:54] don't be troubled by word or letter uh
[55:58] uh as from us amen as that the day of
[56:03] Christ is at hand Paul said that 2,000
[56:08] years ago amen the day of Christ is at
[56:12] hand how much more can we say that
[56:16] today how much more has that become a
[56:18] realization and a revelation to us
[56:21] today amen it means much to us more to
[56:24] us than
[56:25] cuz we know now is the time God's about
[56:29] to come take this bride home
[56:32] amen now he's he's getting into this
[56:34] part we talked about in Revelations now
[56:37] let no man deceive you by any means no
[56:41] man deceive you by any means for that
[56:44] day shall not come what day the day of
[56:47] Christ right that is at hand that day
[56:51] shall not come or will say fully come
[56:55] in its completeness except which excuse
[56:59] me which culones and a body change for
[57:01] us and a Rapture amen all this winds
[57:05] itself up to to a body change to with
[57:09] the changing as of scripture Romans 8 it
[57:12] says to it the changing of our bodies
[57:16] amen amen that's the culmination where
[57:18] the bodies changed we go home to meet
[57:20] the Lord in the air
[57:23] amen
[57:26] amen there for this day shall not come
[57:29] except there come a falling away first
[57:33] Falling Away first and that the man of
[57:36] sin be revealed the son of predition now
[57:38] we know the son of predition we know the
[57:41] man of sin has already been revealed we
[57:44] went through that we talked about that
[57:46] just a few minutes ago in
[57:49] Revelation and going back again to
[57:52] Daniel uh Daniel 12:4 uh Revelation
[57:56] 10:4 that God stopped these great men
[58:00] from revealing and opening that portion
[58:03] because it wasn't to be revealed for
[58:05] them in that day it was only for this
[58:07] day amen it was only for this time and
[58:11] brother brandham even rebutted those
[58:13] people that thought that it was going to
[58:15] be something that was going to be an
[58:17] addition to the Scripture it was going
[58:19] to be a change to the scripture brother
[58:21] absolutely not cannot be a change to the
[58:24] scripture it cannot be a subtraction
[58:26] from the Scripture it cannot be an
[58:27] addition to the Scripture it has to be
[58:30] something that has been hidden there by
[58:33] God through ages and generations and
[58:35] times that was to be revealed we know
[58:39] 1963 March that this day that scripture
[58:43] was fulfilled amen praise the Lord amen
[58:46] we know now that that man of sin has
[58:50] been revealed this great falling away
[58:54] now we're talking about the day of
[58:56] Christ
[58:59] coming that there
[59:01] be a great falling
[59:04] away and that the man of sin be revealed
[59:08] now we know that we've seen the great
[59:10] man of sin being revealed what about
[59:12] this Falling
[59:15] Away what about this great falling away
[59:17] it talks about a uh they shall come
[59:19] except there come a come a falling away
[59:23] first oh what about that we we've
[59:25] already know this this uh the the son of
[59:29] sin the man of sin has been revealed the
[59:31] son of predition we know it's been
[59:33] revealed that's Satan the devil we know
[59:36] that what about this great falling away
[59:38] where people were to be leaving this uh
[59:44] by great
[59:45] numbers where have we seen that I me
[59:48] yeah we've had people leave the
[59:51] message uh I'm sure that people people
[59:54] in denominations have had the
[59:56] denominations themselves have had people
[59:58] leaving those denominations and going
[1:00:01] away and and maybe renouncing
[1:00:04] Christianity but I've heard a lot of
[1:00:06] stories where people I read one the
[1:00:08] other day where some woman she got so
[1:00:11] sick and tired of the new age stuff and
[1:00:14] wickery and all that she was a wicked
[1:00:16] and she got so sick and tired of the
[1:00:18] wiccan and the Wizardry all that she got
[1:00:21] so sick of the new age stuff and stones
[1:00:23] and energy rocks and what are all this
[1:00:26] she turned to Jesus Christ she gave her
[1:00:29] heart to Christ she got baptized now I
[1:00:32] don't know how it doesn't say because I
[1:00:34] guess the world doesn't consider that
[1:00:36] pertinent I do but she got baptized and
[1:00:39] she's now going to church serving the
[1:00:41] lord Jesus and says she's never been
[1:00:43] happier in her
[1:00:45] life she finally found this thing that
[1:00:48] she's been searching for her whole life
[1:00:50] and she was raised a Christian but she
[1:00:53] went off for searching for whatever she
[1:00:55] could find whatever was in her heart in
[1:00:57] her soul whatever she thought she needed
[1:01:00] she tried to get it in everything but
[1:01:02] Christ and when she finally can I say
[1:01:05] this she finally as a prodical son came
[1:01:07] to
[1:01:08] herself she she went to Christ and she's
[1:01:12] never been happier she says she finally
[1:01:13] found what she's looking for so we do
[1:01:15] have these people falling out what about
[1:01:18] the there's some that are coming in too
[1:01:20] me amen few people that are seeing this
[1:01:24] brother Roger went to a Home Depot the
[1:01:26] other day and theft is the way it is now
[1:01:31] ramp it everywhere nobody seems to care
[1:01:34] um it would appear as so anyway I
[1:01:36] shouldn't say nobody that's an absolute
[1:01:38] statement there are people that care but
[1:01:40] it would seem as though nobody cares so
[1:01:43] they have to lock everything up now
[1:01:45] especially wire so they have uh all the
[1:01:49] wire all the electrical wire is all is
[1:01:52] all caged up now so you got to go get
[1:01:53] somebody
[1:01:55] and that person has got to take it out
[1:01:58] of lock and key and take it over
[1:02:01] personally they can't hand it to you
[1:02:03] they have to personally take it over and
[1:02:06] stand there with you with the register
[1:02:09] person with the person checking you out
[1:02:11] and make sure you pay for that wire it
[1:02:14] is that it is that
[1:02:16] bad and this woman was the one that was
[1:02:20] doing it for him and uh they were
[1:02:23] walking over and
[1:02:24] she she started the conversation you've
[1:02:26] been doing this long I said yeah I've
[1:02:28] been doing this 30 years but it's only a
[1:02:30] side side job for me even though he does
[1:02:34] it a lot U every day this is a side job
[1:02:38] for me I tell the guys at work same
[1:02:40] thing for me my my manager keeps wanting
[1:02:42] me to become a manager I'm like this you
[1:02:44] got to understand this is not my main
[1:02:46] job this is not my main position in life
[1:02:50] um so if the Lord ever brought that
[1:02:53] about for some reason orever gave me the
[1:02:54] okay to do it I just uh I I don't want
[1:02:57] to get embroiled in that anyway but
[1:03:00] anyway so this lady and he says no but
[1:03:02] then she she says well what do you do
[1:03:04] she he says I pastor of Church he she
[1:03:06] turned around and looked at him says
[1:03:07] would you baptize me
[1:03:09] Sunday wow out of nowhere she baptized
[1:03:13] he baptized the woman that Sunday she's
[1:03:15] been coming to church ever since she was
[1:03:17] there last Sunday night when I when I
[1:03:18] preached we had communion foot washing
[1:03:20] she participated she was all part of it
[1:03:23] amen so it's not just the people like so
[1:03:27] so my question that becomes if if it's
[1:03:29] not so much that people are just leaving
[1:03:32] churches by the droves where is this
[1:03:34] falling away come from it's got to
[1:03:35] happen it's got to be happening now
[1:03:37] because we're that close right
[1:03:41] amen there got to be a spiritual falling
[1:03:44] away yes there's a spiritual Falling
[1:03:47] Away of people leaving the pure
[1:03:51] unadulterated word of God Amen not
[1:03:54] leaving churches not leaving
[1:03:56] Christianity but leaving the pure
[1:03:59] unadulterated word of God falling away
[1:04:02] to some man-made something or somebody
[1:04:05] who has devised something in their mind
[1:04:07] that they think it's an interpretation
[1:04:10] that they believe of the word and that
[1:04:12] is absolutely contrary to the scripture
[1:04:15] contrary to the message contrary to
[1:04:18] Jesus's writings cuz we know this isn't
[1:04:21] for personal interpretation this is for
[1:04:25] God to reveal it to his people and for
[1:04:28] us to see that and and to know that
[1:04:30] through this seventh angel Prophet
[1:04:32] messenger William Brandon that came to
[1:04:34] bring us a message to guide us along in
[1:04:37] that way that we hold dear that keeps us
[1:04:41] on that on that straight narrow the pure
[1:04:44] unadulterated word amen nothing mixed no
[1:04:47] manmade ideas no charismatic no
[1:04:50] denomination no uh no other church or
[1:04:53] men's ideas simply purely the word of
[1:04:57] God yes and it alone people leave
[1:05:02] falling away leaving and falling away
[1:05:05] they're not leaving church a lot of them
[1:05:08] still go to church people that have left
[1:05:10] the message people I know that have left
[1:05:13] the message pastors I know that have
[1:05:14] left the message they most of them they
[1:05:16] kept their churches they just told their
[1:05:19] people I just don't believe this
[1:05:22] anymore I'm just going to preach for the
[1:05:24] Bible preach what your interpretation of
[1:05:27] what you think the Bible says
[1:05:30] right where does it in Saints yeah we
[1:05:33] know where it begins yes they fall away
[1:05:35] not from Christianity but they're
[1:05:37] leaving off from the true pure word of
[1:05:40] God and that falling away my Saints is
[1:05:43] happening
[1:05:45] now it is still happening yes it's still
[1:05:48] continuing I used to go preach for
[1:05:50] Brother John Keith and Buford bless his
[1:05:52] heart he's passed away great man of God
[1:05:54] God his whole family except for his
[1:05:56] daughter and his wife left and moved
[1:05:58] when they heard some other somebody it's
[1:06:01] like my wife says she says why don't
[1:06:03] these people if they don't believe it
[1:06:05] anymore just leave just go
[1:06:08] leave just nobody needs to hear from you
[1:06:11] anymore you you don't need to Splatter
[1:06:14] all over social media how horrible
[1:06:17] William brandom was and how wrong this
[1:06:20] message is just leave but they can't do
[1:06:23] that that right they can't do that it's
[1:06:27] an anointing Saints yes it's an
[1:06:29] anointing that's on that person not just
[1:06:32] to look at something and say oh I don't
[1:06:34] believe that I'm just going to go do
[1:06:36] something else no they have to slander
[1:06:40] and Slaughter and be besmer and defame
[1:06:43] everything about it it it it's like a
[1:06:47] personal goal to them I'm not even going
[1:06:50] to tell you some of the things I've
[1:06:52] heard people say about brother Brown I
[1:06:54] don't I don't I didn't want to hear I
[1:06:57] even told a person told me I said look I
[1:06:59] don't want to hear that I I don't want
[1:07:00] to hear any any of that that anybody
[1:07:03] said and if and if a person feels they
[1:07:05] want to be informed to know these things
[1:07:08] that's fine that's to them I
[1:07:10] don't I don't but what I do know is I
[1:07:14] can find what's going on in the
[1:07:16] scripture and that's what I'm concerned
[1:07:18] with what does the Bible say about it we
[1:07:21] know what the Bible says about it not
[1:07:23] just here but in other places we're just
[1:07:25] talking about it here we just read a
[1:07:27] portion of it in Revelation as well it's
[1:07:30] going to continue on that way Saints
[1:07:33] amen because this last day brother
[1:07:35] random talked about one in a million
[1:07:38] amen now he wasn't talking about one in
[1:07:40] the million as the bride he was talking
[1:07:42] about one in the million as like an
[1:07:43] alive and remain group those that's
[1:07:46] going to be at the end when this Rapture
[1:07:48] really takes place it's going to be a
[1:07:50] small number yes it doesn't it doesn't
[1:07:53] discourage me I'll be honest with you
[1:07:55] now I've always felt that things that
[1:07:57] the Lord has put on my heart and that's
[1:07:58] been just between me and the Lord
[1:07:59] there's other people that are that
[1:08:01] should be coming here that's but that's
[1:08:03] between them and God right I don't get
[1:08:06] discouraged with small
[1:08:08] numbers amen it's always been small
[1:08:10] numbers in the Bible yes Jesus he chose
[1:08:14] 12 disciples not
[1:08:17] 10,000 he always the the reference to
[1:08:20] home churches fear not little flock it's
[1:08:23] always small that's not making an excuse
[1:08:25] because we have a small church that's
[1:08:26] just the truth right that's just a fact
[1:08:29] and that's not discounting any larger
[1:08:31] churches or any churches that have uh uh
[1:08:33] you know hundreds of people or thousands
[1:08:35] of people I'm not discounting those
[1:08:36] people that's between them and God I'm
[1:08:39] just saying what the scripture says
[1:08:41] that's what I'm obligated to say what
[1:08:43] does the Bible say a great falling away
[1:08:46] or that day shall not come except there
[1:08:48] come a falling away first it's not
[1:08:50] people leaving Christianity it's people
[1:08:53] leaving the the the truth people falling
[1:08:56] away from the pure unadulterated word
[1:08:59] amen I haven't heard any Rumblings about
[1:09:01] when that brother Billy Paul's passed
[1:09:04] away I think probably as old as Billy
[1:09:07] Paul was that a lot of people those that
[1:09:09] probably already had it settled in their
[1:09:10] hearts maybe uh whatever it is they want
[1:09:13] to excuse about that or think about that
[1:09:15] or the prophecy they held and however
[1:09:19] that is people have to work that out PE
[1:09:21] you the Bible says to work out your own
[1:09:23] salvation
[1:09:24] right you just better do it with fear
[1:09:27] and trembling amen that's the part A lot
[1:09:29] of people leave off they say well the
[1:09:31] Bible says work out your own salvation
[1:09:33] it does but it says but with fear and
[1:09:35] trembling reverence to God right
[1:09:38] trembling Amen to make sure that you
[1:09:41] know you are where you're supposed to be
[1:09:42] in the Lord Jesus now let's continue or
[1:09:45] I'll never finish
[1:09:47] this that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:09:50] of predition we know that has happened
[1:09:51] look who opposeth
[1:09:54] and exalteth himself above all that is
[1:09:57] called God or that is worshiped so that
[1:10:01] he as God Seth in the temple of God
[1:10:04] showing himself that he is God Amen
[1:10:08] exactly Isaiah 14 we can go back and
[1:10:12] read it but you can read it on your own
[1:10:13] we know it probably some of us by heart
[1:10:16] Satan's Proclamation that was described
[1:10:19] in Isaiah by Isaiah of his desire to
[1:10:22] want to be exalted of God to be
[1:10:24] worshiped like God to be the one that
[1:10:27] people look to that people worship amen
[1:10:29] he wanted to be that one he thought he
[1:10:32] was going to be that one amen and now we
[1:10:35] know and we can see in the scripture
[1:10:38] that he opposeth and exalteth himself
[1:10:41] above he exalteth
[1:10:44] himself above all that is called God or
[1:10:48] that is worship so that he as God listen
[1:10:52] to this now he
[1:10:54] Satan as
[1:10:56] God sth in the temple of God the
[1:11:01] churches showing himself that he is God
[1:11:06] what is God God is an object of worship
[1:11:10] amen he has always wanted to have that
[1:11:14] worship that position to be exalted
[1:11:18] above the true Living
[1:11:21] God as God showing himself that he is
[1:11:25] God look at what brother random said
[1:11:26] about that if I can find it
[1:11:32] here
[1:11:33] amen C now this God of this evil age
[1:11:38] civilization knowledge perverts God's
[1:11:42] word to suit their own taste they
[1:11:45] pervert God's word to suit their own
[1:11:49] tastes every denomination does the same
[1:11:53] thing and that's not just saying that
[1:11:55] just because they have Baptist or
[1:11:57] Methodist or Catholic or something not
[1:11:59] just that but anything that sets under a
[1:12:03] denominational spirit is a denomination
[1:12:06] anything that sets under a nickan
[1:12:09] denomination spirit is the denomination
[1:12:12] whether they've T Tabernacle to it
[1:12:14] Temple to it or they or or or Baptist or
[1:12:18] Methodist or whatever if it sets under a
[1:12:22] denominational ncol it's in spirit it's
[1:12:24] a
[1:12:26] denomination every
[1:12:28] denomination does the same thing Satan
[1:12:32] look now in that church Satan now then
[1:12:37] preaches his own Gospel of
[1:12:40] knowledge where preaches his own and now
[1:12:43] how is he doing how is Satan
[1:12:47] preaching finding subjects to work
[1:12:49] through yes finding subjects that'll
[1:12:52] believe his Li
[1:12:54] that'll hold to his twisting of the word
[1:12:56] of God to find those that will be
[1:12:59] willing to for whatever reason money
[1:13:03] well brother Brown said money women
[1:13:05] popularity those are the three things
[1:13:07] brother Brown talked about amen whether
[1:13:09] it be one or all however Satan does it
[1:13:13] amen garnering these people to preach
[1:13:16] whatever have a big
[1:13:17] crowd uh to pull in a big church pull in
[1:13:23] numbers pull in money be popular look
[1:13:27] look look like the most important or the
[1:13:29] best amen look friend in the economy of
[1:13:32] God numbers does not denote best right
[1:13:36] right amen again going back to what we
[1:13:39] said a minute ago far from it
[1:13:41] scripturally far from it look now but he
[1:13:45] says now Satan Satan using vessels Satan
[1:13:51] preaches his own Gospel of knowledge a
[1:13:55] perversion of the word and it can be so
[1:13:58] much as 99% word right we know that cuz
[1:14:01] brother BR say that's what he did in the
[1:14:03] garden of Ed Eve brought her 99% truth
[1:14:07] but that 1% defiled the whole Humanity
[1:14:09] the only whole human race amen started
[1:14:13] the ball rolling anyway that perversion
[1:14:16] preaching his own Gospel of knowledge
[1:14:18] where in his own
[1:14:22] church mine that's why aabad written
[1:14:25] over the door yes why because God has
[1:14:28] left this place yes that's what aabad
[1:14:30] means God has left this place who's in
[1:14:34] charge not the
[1:14:37] pastor Satan the devil's in charge when
[1:14:41] God leaves there's only one other denom
[1:14:44] dominating Spirit to take over and
[1:14:46] that's the devil yes that's the only
[1:14:48] thing that's left all of us are just
[1:14:51] puppets just going along people are just
[1:14:54] with whatever their influence is I would
[1:14:57] just want my influence to be the
[1:14:58] almighty
[1:14:59] God Amen not the devil any deviation off
[1:15:03] the word whether it's my idea or someone
[1:15:08] else's or some denomination or some
[1:15:10] Seminary it needs to be what the word of
[1:15:13] God
[1:15:14] says brother bam did not come with an
[1:15:17] interpretation of the word he come to
[1:15:20] preach the truth of the word the
[1:15:22] revelation of the word God inspired him
[1:15:24] to do so yes but that doesn't make him
[1:15:27] any better than you or I because he does
[1:15:28] the exact same thing for us he was a
[1:15:31] different position he was a prophet of
[1:15:33] God to be able to receive that so he
[1:15:36] could bring it to us but God reveals it
[1:15:38] to us in the same way yes he has to
[1:15:42] because it's God he got to do the same
[1:15:45] thing the same way as he has always
[1:15:48] done he is God as God as god notice not
[1:15:53] not God but as God Seth in the temple of
[1:15:56] God his own church we just read brother
[1:15:59] Ram said in his own church showing
[1:16:02] himself that he is God he has become the
[1:16:05] object of worship how has Satan become
[1:16:08] the object of worship because they've
[1:16:11] neglected and denied Jesus Christ right
[1:16:14] they stand and sing it they stand and
[1:16:16] preach it but they deny the word they
[1:16:19] deny Christ and by denying any one word
[1:16:23] of the word is denying Christ yes amen
[1:16:27] amen any one word denies Christ that's
[1:16:31] how they deny Christ oh we're Christians
[1:16:34] we believe we have church we have uh
[1:16:37] songs we have preaching we preach out of
[1:16:40] the Bible but do you preach the pure
[1:16:43] unadulterated word out of the Bible or
[1:16:45] some man's idea or your own
[1:16:47] interpretation did you get your sermon
[1:16:49] off of YouTube did you find it off of
[1:16:52] some place that gave you a nice
[1:16:56] amen I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:16:58] Saints your P I have never done that I
[1:17:01] never planned to do that either I've
[1:17:03] gotten a thought here and there when
[1:17:05] I've gone to a church or something like
[1:17:06] brother Rogers the other day I might get
[1:17:08] a thought or something from somebody
[1:17:10] they said but go to try to find a Ser
[1:17:12] I've actually gone to a Christian
[1:17:15] bookstore and you can you can actually
[1:17:18] buy a book of recommended
[1:17:22] sermons you can actually read them word
[1:17:25] for word write out of the book if you
[1:17:26] want
[1:17:28] to that's where is God yes where who
[1:17:32] wrote this down by what Authority does
[1:17:35] this person have to put this in a book
[1:17:38] for you to read to your
[1:17:40] congregation so that that congregation
[1:17:43] is going to be fed by the pure word of
[1:17:45] God what gives that person that
[1:17:48] Authority I I just I I just like to know
[1:17:52] but you you see it's the same
[1:17:55] enemy amen it's the same enemy and so
[1:17:58] many times he uses the education thing
[1:18:01] he tries to make it so revelated that's
[1:18:05] that's the word that's use so revelated
[1:18:07] uh try to make it so hard to understand
[1:18:11] for the common person that that all they
[1:18:13] can do is just well that must be true
[1:18:16] because I couldn't understand it yeah
[1:18:20] amen well that's the world that's
[1:18:23] exactly what the world feeds you you
[1:18:25] know that the the the science politics
[1:18:29] medicine they they always try to feed
[1:18:32] the the the common public with things
[1:18:35] that they can't understand mik is
[1:18:38] talking about the Medicare thing we went
[1:18:40] to lunch last Sunday and I heard
[1:18:42] somebody behind us talking about
[1:18:44] something as simple as Medicare should
[1:18:45] be so simple that a 90-year-old should
[1:18:48] be able to understand to be able to make
[1:18:49] the right choices and do the right thing
[1:18:51] but the government has made it so
[1:18:54] complicated oh people like well it it
[1:18:57] must be right cuz I can't understand it
[1:19:00] that's what the world does that's what
[1:19:02] that's what government does that's what
[1:19:03] a lot of times medicine stuff they want
[1:19:05] to complicate things so much and that
[1:19:07] same spirit is in the church yes to try
[1:19:10] to make things so highly and revelated
[1:19:12] and so complicated and so that people I
[1:19:15] spent an hour and a half one time riding
[1:19:17] home from uh some uh meetings back in
[1:19:20] North Carolina with my pastor and
[1:19:21] another brother and this brother I don't
[1:19:24] even think he took a breath for an hour
[1:19:26] and a half he talked so
[1:19:28] much and everything he said we got to
[1:19:32] the end and he was trying to ask me
[1:19:33] things I say brother I don't have a clue
[1:19:35] what you
[1:19:36] said I have no idea pulling stuff from
[1:19:39] this message and this message and making
[1:19:41] things so I said who I Hope You Don't
[1:19:44] Preach this to to the common people cuz
[1:19:47] I can't understand it and I'm a minister
[1:19:49] and I know the message I've listened to
[1:19:51] Feast of the trumpets 100 well not a 100
[1:19:54] but many
[1:19:57] times what are you talking about and and
[1:20:02] and you get right down to the bottom
[1:20:03] line of it and you try to tie them with
[1:20:06] the scripture they don't a lot of times
[1:20:07] even know what they're saying yes they
[1:20:10] just take these pet quoes and stuff and
[1:20:12] they try to throw them all together to
[1:20:13] try to make something sound like
[1:20:15] something that's not yeah but it
[1:20:17] confuses people so much this well that's
[1:20:19] it must be right cuz he's a smart guy
[1:20:22] and I'm might I can understand it but
[1:20:23] he's a smart guy it's got to be
[1:20:25] right no it
[1:20:27] doesn't we've went through the
[1:20:29] Simplicity part of that already amen no
[1:20:32] it does not have to be right but God a
[1:20:35] Satan showing himself as God in his own
[1:20:38] church with people worshiping him hands
[1:20:42] raised tears falling amen mascara
[1:20:45] running he's doing the exact same thing
[1:20:48] they're worshiping a devil and they
[1:20:49] don't even know
[1:20:51] it through the word through the sword
[1:20:55] that was given to him let's
[1:20:58] continue Satan's Eden god of the world
[1:21:02] Satan is God of this Earth remember ye
[1:21:05] not that when I was yet with you I told
[1:21:08] you these things and now ye know what
[1:21:11] withholdeth or what hindereth what
[1:21:14] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[1:21:17] his time and we just went through that
[1:21:19] with uh with talking about Daniel
[1:21:21] Revelation 10
[1:21:23] that it was held back so that it would
[1:21:25] be revealed in that time in God's time
[1:21:28] it says his time uh which is that time
[1:21:31] of the
[1:21:32] devil God is the one who's orchestrating
[1:21:34] the whole thing amen amen so it's being
[1:21:37] held back till it's revealed in its
[1:21:40] proper time till its right time says his
[1:21:42] time for the mystery of iniquity and
[1:21:45] that is lawlessness amen lawlessness uh
[1:21:48] iniquity is doing something you know you
[1:21:50] shouldn't or not doing something you
[1:21:51] know you should which is basically
[1:21:54] lawlessness the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:21:58] already work only he who now leth will
[1:22:02] let or or uh would you say he who
[1:22:06] restrains will hold back will let he
[1:22:10] will be taken out of the way praise God
[1:22:14] look now and then shall that Wicked be
[1:22:19] revealed and it is whom the Lord shall
[1:22:23] consume the Lord shall consume with the
[1:22:27] spirit of his mouth we've already read
[1:22:31] the scripture to identify what that is
[1:22:33] amen consuming him destroying him with
[1:22:38] the word yes praise God because that's
[1:22:41] the one thing brother said he could not
[1:22:44] do he said he he can impersonate any
[1:22:48] kind of a gift speaking tongues Prophet
[1:22:50] all these he can impersonate any of
[1:22:52] those gifts but he cannot he cannot
[1:22:55] bring that word word by word by word
[1:22:58] amen so he cannot bring that word word
[1:23:01] by word so what is it it's that it's the
[1:23:04] it's the death strike of the sword that
[1:23:08] kills him consumed with the spirit of
[1:23:12] his mouth and he shall destroy with the
[1:23:15] brightness of his coming praise the Lord
[1:23:17] I just denote that as as the mechanics
[1:23:20] and Dynamics amen brightness the word is
[1:23:23] the sword the brightness of his mouth
[1:23:25] the brightness is the spirit
[1:23:27] amen praise the Lord even him let me
[1:23:31] finish through this even him whose
[1:23:33] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:23:36] with all power and signs and lying
[1:23:39] wonders and with all dece deceivableness
[1:23:43] of unrighteousness in them in who in
[1:23:47] them that
[1:23:49] perish not in the bride not not in The
[1:23:52] Believer but in that in in them that
[1:23:56] perish because they who they the ones
[1:24:00] that
[1:24:01] perish receive not the love of the
[1:24:05] truth they've received a a a a knowledge
[1:24:09] of a truth they've received a word
[1:24:12] they've said in church they've gone to
[1:24:13] Seminary but to receive the love of the
[1:24:17] truth is two different things remember
[1:24:20] that love that something comes from what
[1:24:22] do we say I love you with all my
[1:24:26] heart if you go back to Isaiah 14 and
[1:24:30] talking about Satan
[1:24:32] again what is the first thing the first
[1:24:34] thing it points out without reading it
[1:24:36] you can go back and read it the first
[1:24:38] thing is point out that says in your
[1:24:42] heart or in his heart in Satan's heart
[1:24:45] it was in his heart amen something that
[1:24:48] was determined not an idea not a thought
[1:24:52] but in his heart he was going to become
[1:24:55] like God exalted above the Stars be
[1:24:59] worshiped like God in his heart now look
[1:25:04] they say that this received not the love
[1:25:06] of the truth where in their heart right
[1:25:10] it's not in them it might be on them it
[1:25:14] might be something in their flesh or
[1:25:15] Spirit but there's no love there there's
[1:25:18] no when there's no love there's no
[1:25:19] Revelation there's no Revelation no
[1:25:21] desire for the true word for the pure
[1:25:24] word of God it's simply a letter it's
[1:25:28] simply a word amen it's not a truth it's
[1:25:31] not a revelation they received not the
[1:25:34] love of the truth that they might be
[1:25:37] saved and for this cause
[1:25:41] God God you see again you wonder how
[1:25:44] where does this come from who gives this
[1:25:47] Authority God shall send them strong
[1:25:51] delusion
[1:25:53] that they should believe a
[1:25:55] lie praise the Lord now I I'm someone
[1:26:00] that I I you know I don't I don't I'm
[1:26:03] not working to change the word but to
[1:26:05] look at the word a little
[1:26:07] closer and to recognizing the
[1:26:09] characteristics of God that God would
[1:26:12] not purposely cause a stumbling block
[1:26:15] but God does
[1:26:18] allow things to happen so that that
[1:26:21] person would
[1:26:23] stumble God would allow that but it's
[1:26:26] Satan that's working it so when it says
[1:26:29] God send them strong delusion that's
[1:26:31] it's just like uh when they went down to
[1:26:35] Micah uh God was looking around seeing
[1:26:37] who is going to deceive Ahab in the
[1:26:41] going up there and getting killed to
[1:26:43] fulfill Elijah's
[1:26:46] prophecy and a and a lying Spirit came
[1:26:49] up and said I'll do it I'll put a lying
[1:26:52] spirit in the mouth of every one of his
[1:26:54] prophets and it'll convince him that he
[1:26:56] needs to do this God says you'll do it
[1:26:58] go
[1:26:59] ahead God didn't do it but he allowed it
[1:27:03] amen you say that lying Spirit was sent
[1:27:06] forth from God it was in the presence of
[1:27:10] God but the person that that Spirit did
[1:27:12] it Satan is doing it God sending them
[1:27:16] strong delusion what is that that's test
[1:27:20] are we going to believe or are we not
[1:27:21] going to believe
[1:27:23] God will hit our lives friends with
[1:27:26] unbelievable sometimes what we might
[1:27:28] think unbearable tests things that we
[1:27:32] don't know or believe that we could go
[1:27:35] through again it's like brother random
[1:27:38] when he lost his wife and his baby how
[1:27:40] did you keep your religion I didn't he
[1:27:41] kept
[1:27:43] me and to understand that those tests
[1:27:47] they're
[1:27:49] hard they're at and they're very
[1:27:53] personal sometimes they hit
[1:27:56] home but God's the one in charge Sint
[1:28:00] amen because he's weeding out and and
[1:28:04] and taking away the unbeliever the make
[1:28:07] believer if you will the one that has
[1:28:10] come and rubbed right up against but not
[1:28:13] a part of it's like the five wise and
[1:28:16] the five foolish amen but there's even
[1:28:19] those that that come that look just just
[1:28:22] like the genuine that they're not even
[1:28:24] foolish virgin they're not even a part
[1:28:27] of the kingdom of God at all period
[1:28:30] That's I say that with very sincere
[1:28:33] sadness amen right but it's a scripture
[1:28:36] and it's trueth yes am I just thank God
[1:28:39] I'm not I'm not one of those amen but
[1:28:43] from my heart to believe this word it's
[1:28:45] a truth this message this message people
[1:28:49] say what they want is truth amen
[1:28:54] and for this cause God sent them strong
[1:28:56] delusion that they should believe a lie
[1:28:57] and that they all might be damned or
[1:29:00] judged who believed not the truth but
[1:29:03] had pleasure in
[1:29:05] unrighteousness amen they they would
[1:29:07] rather have prefer having something of
[1:29:11] unrighteousness something of the flesh
[1:29:13] rather than brother Dennis quoted in in
[1:29:16] his prayer today and Timothy amen he
[1:29:19] High minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:29:21] lovers of God false break truce Breakers
[1:29:24] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[1:29:26] others that are good amen reject the
[1:29:29] word don't want to have anything to do
[1:29:31] with God although they come up and look
[1:29:33] like they are a part of
[1:29:35] uh a move of God a Christian belief or
[1:29:38] some do denomination or group of some
[1:29:41] kind but they have no desire in their
[1:29:44] heart for God there's nothing there it's
[1:29:47] Satan that's orchestrating this whole
[1:29:50] thing being contrary is being something
[1:29:53] that is being contrar is being something
[1:29:55] that's other than what God has already
[1:29:58] brought amen and unfortunately a lot of
[1:30:01] people bring something other than what
[1:30:03] has been brought in the disguise of
[1:30:06] something that's been brought they'll
[1:30:08] make it sound like something that has
[1:30:11] been said or something that's in the
[1:30:12] message when it really isn't or taking a
[1:30:15] quote here or a quote there or a
[1:30:17] scripture here a scripture there and try
[1:30:18] to make something out of something
[1:30:20] that's not that's not in the continuity
[1:30:22] of the scripture or in the continuity of
[1:30:25] the spirit of the message even the
[1:30:27] spirit of the man
[1:30:30] amen um let me read this I'll
[1:30:33] close seed of discrepancy uh Phoenix
[1:30:37] 1965 when a man stands and says he is a
[1:30:41] gospel preacher and says that the days
[1:30:43] of Miracles is passed that is the seat
[1:30:46] of
[1:30:48] discrepancy when a man stands and says
[1:30:51] that he's a Minister a pastor of a
[1:30:53] church of somewhere and he does not
[1:30:55] believe that Jesus Christ is the same in
[1:30:58] every detail except the physical body
[1:31:02] same yesterday today and forever that's
[1:31:05] the seat of
[1:31:06] discrepancy when he says that miracles
[1:31:09] in Apostolic age pass that's the seed of
[1:31:12] discrepancy when they say there is no
[1:31:14] such a thing as Divine Healing that's
[1:31:16] the seed of discrepancy and the word is
[1:31:19] full of it it crowds out and chokes out
[1:31:22] the wheat we notice that the first so of
[1:31:25] the seed of discrepancy was branded the
[1:31:27] devil the first s the first Ser of the
[1:31:30] seed of discrepancy was branded the
[1:31:34] devil who was it branded that by
[1:31:37] God and we know it was Genesis 1 and we
[1:31:40] find out here in the Book of Matthew
[1:31:41] 13th chapter Jesus still Brands listen
[1:31:45] to this now Jesus still Brands any
[1:31:48] discrepancy to his word as being the
[1:31:54] devil
[1:31:55] amen any discrepancy to God's word as
[1:32:00] being the
[1:32:02] devil this
[1:32:04] 1956 and those who want to follow that
[1:32:08] every word brother Bram spoke was divine
[1:32:10] I'll challenge you with this one right
[1:32:13] here brother Bram says and in this
[1:32:17] 1956 it's
[1:32:20] 1965 was brother brandom teleported it
[1:32:23] all of a sudden back to 506 no he's a
[1:32:26] man I made a mistake amen that simple
[1:32:29] amen it's not difficult to understand
[1:32:31] it's difficult to understand when you
[1:32:32] make a man God yeah you can't reconcile
[1:32:35] that but when you understand he was a
[1:32:38] man that God was using then you could
[1:32:41] understand that man can make a mistake I
[1:32:43] make mistakes up here all the time say
[1:32:46] things that uh confuse one word of the
[1:32:49] other or one person in the Bible of the
[1:32:51] or something I've done that since I
[1:32:53] started preaching I guess I don't know
[1:32:56] that me as a human that'll ever stop but
[1:32:59] brother Brandon said this 1956 it was
[1:33:02] 1965 not
[1:33:04] 1956 anything and I'll close with this
[1:33:08] anything that SWS discrepancy contrary
[1:33:12] to the written word of God or or puts
[1:33:16] any private interpretation to it it is
[1:33:19] the seed of discrepancy any private
[1:33:22] interpretation makes it the seat of
[1:33:24] discrepancy God will not honor it he
[1:33:27] can't because it won't mix with the pure
[1:33:30] word of God it certainly will not it's
[1:33:34] like the Mustard Seed it won't mix it
[1:33:37] can't because it's discrepancy it is uh
[1:33:41] it is uh something other than the true
[1:33:46] pure word of God and it's got to be the
[1:33:49] pure word to be correct now we know that
[1:33:53] this man of sin has been revealed we
[1:33:56] know that that sin is
[1:34:00] unbelief and
[1:34:02] that orchestration of what the devil is
[1:34:05] doing is to get as many people to
[1:34:09] disbelieve the pure unadulterated word
[1:34:12] as he possibly can and if he's got to
[1:34:15] work through people churches ministers
[1:34:18] he'll do so and he does do so and it'll
[1:34:22] be so close that it would deceive the
[1:34:24] very elect if it were possible but thank
[1:34:27] God it is not possible for the elect to
[1:34:30] be
[1:34:31] deceived amen praise the Lord let's
[1:34:34] stand a
[1:34:37] few as I said next week it it will get a
[1:34:41] lot more
[1:34:46] personal it'll get a lot more down home
[1:34:50] amen because we can understand and see
[1:34:53] friends it's not the things out in the
[1:34:55] world
[1:34:56] today it's not the Baptist it's not the
[1:34:59] Methodist it's not the Catholic it it's
[1:35:02] not even the the charismatic churches
[1:35:06] amen it's right here amongst
[1:35:09] us amen right here amongst us yes and it
[1:35:14] behooves us to be very careful yes but
[1:35:17] God look I don't know if you've ever
[1:35:19] been in a situation like that
[1:35:22] as many people as I know as many places
[1:35:24] as I've been as many churches as I've
[1:35:26] preached in I've seen it uh I've watched
[1:35:29] it happen I've seen certain things like
[1:35:32] that unfold and manifest themselves
[1:35:37] to their detriment and and my
[1:35:40] displeasure happen I've seen certain
[1:35:43] things like that unfold and manifest
[1:35:46] themselves
[1:35:49] to their detriment and and my
[1:35:52] displeasure but it
[1:35:54] happens and it's true yes but it's the
[1:35:58] word yes can't deny the word
[1:36:02] amen
[1:36:03] unfortunately it does happen it's
[1:36:05] happened to people I know yes people
[1:36:07] that have been very close to me people I
[1:36:09] considered good friends amen but God
[1:36:13] knows but God always the thing that I
[1:36:17] solace in is that God always has for me
[1:36:22] has brought something
[1:36:24] about like a revelation and begins to
[1:36:28] warn me that something's going on I
[1:36:30] don't know about you I don't know if
[1:36:32] you've ever been in those situations I
[1:36:33] have and it's something that God brings
[1:36:36] around and I just one particular brother
[1:36:39] I'm thinking I'm like I have a
[1:36:40] conversation with him
[1:36:42] like there's something not right about
[1:36:45] that something in my spirit something in
[1:36:49] me just just didn't identify with what
[1:36:51] he was was talking about right and it
[1:36:54] goes on next conversation or something
[1:36:58] or something's eating at me it just it
[1:37:00] just it just devolves but but God is
[1:37:03] there to witness to you yes amen for
[1:37:06] those who are the believer God is there
[1:37:07] to witness to you to say this is not
[1:37:11] right be be careful yes amen don't be
[1:37:14] taken in with this I even had a brother
[1:37:16] call me one time or I called him I think
[1:37:19] and he well you can listen to this
[1:37:21] certain so and so brother about brother
[1:37:24] r a message so so I said I don't want to
[1:37:26] I can send it to you don't I won't watch
[1:37:30] it I don't care I don't want to hear so
[1:37:34] and so or brother so and so or a
[1:37:37] minister or a pastor I don't want to if
[1:37:39] if they're going to if they're going to
[1:37:40] bring something contrary in discrepancy
[1:37:43] to what I know the truth I don't want to
[1:37:45] hear it amen am it's not going to sway
[1:37:48] me anyway what it's going to do is waste
[1:37:50] my time
[1:37:52] and I don't have time for it I I'm not
[1:37:54] going to I'm not going to give place to
[1:37:56] the devil amen amen and that's just the
[1:37:59] bottom line God says you know be
[1:38:02] careful he always takes care of his own
[1:38:05] he watches after his own praise the Lord
