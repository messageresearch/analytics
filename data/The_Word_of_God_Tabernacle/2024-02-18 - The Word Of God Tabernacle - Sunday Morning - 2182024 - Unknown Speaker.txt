amen thank you Jesus amen can we stand to our feet now amen and just go right to the word amen we'll try to pick up where we left off the last time uh almost a month ago now we had uh uh unex I the way it fell together I just was uh kind of surprised me actually uh I was in studying a month ago in my office and uh all of a sudden I'm thinking wow okay I'm I'm actually not preaching Sunday well I'm not preaching the next or the next Sunday so uh I might have planned it a little differently maybe if I had known that U maybe it would have started this today uh because it kind of flows together but uh it'll be all right we'll background a little bit and uh the Lord will just bless us and help us and of course uh if you ever want to go back to revisit or renew or look at again uh all every all the services we have get uploaded to YouTube as soon as we stop streaming so you can always go back and look and is anything or or questions are always welcome too amen praise the Lord let's go over to Matthew now chapter 11 this is still God in simp amen this will be part 11 and the subtitle Bride versus the church part two so God in Simplicity we started this the last time was part one um that we did here with the board was part two last time uh part one so this will be part two so amen Matthew 11:25 before we read the word we just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious Lord Jesus again we bow our heads Lord toward this dirt this dust this Earth from when our bodies came Lord giving you thanks and praise Lord that once again we woke up this morning because there was life In This Cloud of dirt and Lord it and this little cloud of North Carolina dirt decided and in its heart it wanted to come to the house of God today I had a choice I didn't have to come I came because I wanted to I believe we all are here because we wanted to Lord God I believe those may be setting there streaming they want to Lord we do this because we have a desire in our heart Lord to please you we have a desire in our heart to want to learn about you to want to know you more to know you greater to expect you Lord to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think to to move Upon Our Hearts and lives to strengthen us once again to give us what we need for the continuing battle in this world that we live God and it is getting worse every day we know that lord it's it's it's obviously prophesied in the scripture we knew it was going to happen Lord and we've seen it progress in my lifetime I have at once it seemed like it was a slow progression but Lord now it it it just seems like there's giant leaps of of ungodliness that take place every day we live yes and it's it's just getting us to the place that we realize Lord we more and more that we just don't belong here this this is not our place of residence we're sojourners we're pilgrims this is not where we belong this is not where our home is Lord It's it it will eventually but right now in this Cosmos this world order it has nothing to do with who we are and what we believe and how we stand and how we live God may you just continue to help us Lord with all the uh all the strength that you can give us God in our lives to press this battle Lord to help those others who may not see it Lord just to give them a little encouragement God that you might can shine that light upon upon them that they might see it too Lord if there's any lost souls if there's anyone that we can witness to help in any way God let us help them Lord give us the strength lead us guide us show us for this service today we just commit it to you again we ask your blessings upon it again we thank you Lord for being with us us again knowing that Lord you were with us God in in this place before we ever started our first note Lord or sang our first note we know God that you're here bless the remaining part of this service speak to us from your word Lord words can come out of my mouth father but if they don't fall Upon Our Hearts and our ears into our hearts Lord and that you reveal to us God and help encourage Us by it Lord then it's just words that come out of my mouth Lord may you just bless each one of us Lord and strength us God may your Holy Spirit move upon those that are in need those that are sick and body and Lord those request with need Lord that got the text a little late on sharah God may you just touch her Lord in her back and heal her and God take this pain from her father make her feel well I know how I I can only imagine I haven't done it have been a mother but having a couple of children how difficult it can be your husband out working and trying to take care of your children Lord just bless BL her father bless her touch her heal her now God we just commit ourselves to you bless remaining part of the service we commit it into your hands ask these blessings in the name of our Lord Jesus Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Matthew 11 1 verse 25 as we have in this series amen at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because that has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes amen you could be seated if you'd like amen we actually had kind of a another sort of I guess you not really title but uh sub subtitle I guess to the last uh the the last uh message that we had based on our our uh our drawing here not really a drawing but our writings um about uh when the enemy comes in a flood God raises up a standard against it and it I really appreciated the brothers that came in and spoke since so maybe this was ordained of the Lord after all I said I might have waited to do this till today but actually after I did this and then what brother nol and what brother John brought uh really solidifying this was was a tremendous blessing uh to know that uh the what God has placed in us and who we are in him and brother John talking about the rock that we run to and the the strength that God gives us and raising up that standard and and knowing that that standard that God has already given to us that that standard is already in place in our lives that we are that standard that God raises up that he uses for us to be able to overcome all the Ws of the devil that standard that we saw here that we wrote out and this we're not going to really refer to this as much today but I just wanted to bring it up here to just kind of bring a refresher about how through the church ages and how important it was uh how important it was and and in many other ways how important it was that God uh bring an opening of the seals for this day uh and that would bring a revelation of that word to to a prophet and then to us as we individually receive that Revelation from God and what it meant to us down and what it meant to them down through the church ages uh to recognize even from Ephesus to l TOA and how each one of these had its own point and purpose because we know the church that was inside of each one of those and of course the bride age that we talked about that was a part of each one of these because I call that now I know brother Brown talked about the bride age in this last day but there's the bride component in every one of these Church ages and that bride component was anointed by all of the the the the Beast anointings that we read last time uh about each one of these was that anointing for that day the lion anointing the Cal or ox or laboring anointing the man anointing the intelligence and bringing forth uh uh uh ushering in uh the the eagle age for the intelligence of man to be able to have what we have to do what we do and to go where we go and uh to be able to have it uh for for God to send a prop profit and for that word to be revealed for the fullness of the word to be able to come it had to go through each one of these anointings each one of these anointings was upon each one of those that were that were Believers in that day bride of that day were a part of that anointing they were anointed to do what they did that God used these spirits to move on them uh even like we said in the Dark Ages where we we seem to talk about a lot uh because of the dramatic nature of what the bride went through in that day uh of that Ox anointing the Bible says calf but Brown refers to as ox or a laboring anointing it was their anointing to go to uh a burning steak it was an anointing to them to go and and like I said I believe that uh when these things took place as dramatic as they were as hard as it would have been on them physically I believe when they stood there at that burning Stak the feeling the lick of fire dance across their legs I didn't I I don't I don't think they felt that pain uh I I believe that anointing was there to cover and to shroud them and to help them be able to uh fulfill the purpose that they had that God gave them for that day they were just as important just as needful uh as we are today as this last day as any of those ages were cuz that that corn of wheat that seed had to go that bride seed that word seed had to go into the ground and die and root to re to be reborned again which is nothing more than a reflection of Jesus of them in the Garden of Eden a reflection of mzc a reflection of Jesus Christ a reflection of our own New Birth yes our own New Birth of ourselves dying out so that there has to be a new life raising in US amen God always continually referring to his word bringing his word to pass amen of course each one of those anointings that we had that we get down now we're obviously going to Major on the Leo deia Church age and the last year the eagle anointing uh the loosening of the holy spirit for this last day God sending a prophet now notice God did not send a prophet to any of these other ages God gave brother Branham the names of men whom he used as reformers if you will at those days that were there as a representative of that time amen We Major on Luther and Wesley of course the last two uh the with the Sardis in Philadelphia Church ages but we know that each one had St Martin and Paul and each one of these that had had that person that was there so since Paul there was not a prophet you had reformers and and those that God would just open remember the seal were like a scroll uh well you could even look at it in in in in a regular book if you just look at it in a regular book uh you can take a book and you can open it to this page but that doesn't reveal what's on this page it just reveals what's on this page yes and through the times God would allow the pages of Revelation if you will to be open uh brother R talked about as a scroll as one would unfold and then the next would unfold and then the next just because you see this page doesn't mean you see this page right but it's God unfolding it but what God wanted to do for us for this last day and one of the things that separates as we see the bride the church is to reveal to the bride by Revelation from God to reveal to her who she is in this word by the full revelation of the word for this last day it had to take a full Revelation not just a part here A Part there uh we know it took a word profit uh for God to reveal to him that uh this uh uh St Martin had this part right and and brought it in and said this is true even with calvinist and Armenian ISM uh brother random just took the truth from each one both of them one was off one side the other uh they take they take what they believed and they went off with it but they went off to the side they left the word at some point and and it took a prophet a word Prophet to take those things and bring them back to a truth back bring them back to a realization in the word but now the word had to be revealed before you could know that that was the truth of God's word that wasn't a man-made tangent or a or a man-made Dogma idea it had to be by Prophet to show that that was the word that was to be for this day that God would show to us and that's showing to us help reveal that word to us and where we belong in the word amen where we belong in the word now you can have a house you can go on the front sto doesn't tell you what's in the kitchen amen you can go get you a bottle of water out of the fridge in the kitchen but that doesn't tell you what's in the bedroom amen you can go in the bedroom you can enjoy a good nap but what happens when you need to go to the bathroom never been there don't know what that's about but see in this day the entirety of it God shine light on the entirety of it so we can know that who we are and how we belong in there amen what what it is to us for that word to be revealed to us for this last day amen now the god takes that Revelation and and and and shines it's a light it's it's it's a manifestation of some Revelation is is a manifestation the realization of God's word truth of God's word to you amen that's why it's called Revelation amen a manifestation is something that a multitude of people could see at one time but a revelation is something that's personal to you only you see that amen it's something that belongs to you now when God does this there's there's it brings a separation uh there's a separation in the word a lot of people a lot of christiandom does not recognize the separation between the church and the bride uh they believe that they're one and the same in fact if you have a Scofield bible like I do most of my studying in a scoffield Bible you see that even in scoffield notes he he conflates the two he does not separate bride and church he basically his notes and his commentary is is is really reflective of the belief that the bride and the church are the same but they're not right amen they are not the same they are not the same group that's why a lot of people have the misunderstanding that the bride goes through the tribulation the bride does not go through the tribulation the church does but the bride does not one of the greatest differences one of the most pronounced differences between the bride and the church is the church goes to the tribulation the bride does not amen we'll get to that a little bit deeper in a minute let's go over to uh Romans chapter 4 Now read a couple of scriptures Romans 4 we'll start with verse 6 Romans 4:6 now this is uh uh probably in my opinion now there's several differences but to me probably the greatest difference the thing that differentiates the most between the church and the bride amen the church again goes through the tribulation there's a reason for that the bride does not and there's a reason for that amen now Romans 4:6 even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without words saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered praise the Lord and that's all that in the quoting of David the the great re revelation of David's day without the Holy Ghost was simply the forgiveness of sin or the covering of sin we know now by the bleach blood through God in Simplicity the bleach blood of Jesus not only forgave not only covered but annihilated sin the whole point of the bleach blood of Jesus was that when the drop of ink was was dropped into a tub of bleach that ink separated and every molecule that made up that ink broke down into such a uh such a a minute amount in in inside that bleach it was no longer visible the ink disappears in the bleach because the bleach was made in such a way that it would break down every molecule everything that made up uh the ink blot everything that made up that drop of ink the bleach was manufactured to break down and to get rid of now if you were to take the bleach and you were to examine it amen you might find the molecules that made up that ink I don't know I'm not a scientist but I know that when the ink goes in the bleach it is gone you can no longer longer see it amen it breaks it down to its original it it it takes what it became and it and it and it breaks it apart and takes it back to its original state whatever that is atoms of carbons I don't know I'm not smart enough to be to know that science whatever it is somebody spart of me can come explain it but the truth of it is when when that drop of ink is broke down into that tub of bleach and and and and dissolves it down back to its original state all it does to me even though I can't understand it and can't explain it what it tells me is that every drop of sin that Satan ever tries to account to you is broken down to its original place by the blood of Jesus Christ and who is the originator of sin Satan himself praise God that's why brother random said that goes to the head of Satan and lays on him till the day of judgment amen every sin that he tried to put on you belongs to him amen because that drop of ink in the tub of bleach hallelujah it's not just forgiven Saints you know what brother brandom said about forgiven in invisible union he said you are Justified Justified means means as though you never did it he even give the example with brother green he can say brother green could come along and did and say I forgive you brother Brandon forgive me for what I never did it but I forgive you for it but I didn't do it amen Justified means though you never did it so who did it amen the devil did amen it lays on him he gets accounted at the white Throne judgment friends he gets accounted for every one of those that he tried to pin on you belongs to him amen praise the Lord the purging of sin see the importance David in the vision that he had calling on the importance blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and we know what iniquity is are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the the Lord will not amen if I was a TV preacher i' tell you to repeat after me but I don't do that but to me will not impute sin amen oh just to think about Saints God does not impute them to you that's where a lot of people get caught up in their minds that's where a lot of people get defeated even in their own walk even in their own Christian walk they get defeated because the the devil will continually bring those things and bombard you with things you know that maybe you thought or did or said or something that may have been off color or shouldn't have been said or done or a little temper or something the devil will always bring that back to you but the truth of it is when it's gone into the tub of bleach it's his not not yours amen God does not will not impute that sin to you and that is that that impute just means to reckon it to you to put it on your account yes what does that mean that means that no sin gets put on your account no sin right no unbelief sin is unbelief no unbelief is put on your account praise the Lord could you imagine going to the grocery store or to Lord help Walmart just for and and you go up and you say uh just put it on my account just put it on my account just put it on my account just put it on my account and you go in the next time to the same grocery store how how much I owe you I told you put this last batch of groceries on my account well sir you don't owe anything no I had all this I wanted this put on my no it's it it I'm looking at the account there's nothing on your account you don't owe me anything you don't owe us a DME praise the Lord it cannot will not be put on your account Hallelujah God doesn't even recognize it hallelujah amen the only place he recognizes it through his by his bride is on the head of Satan amen amen the new birth beautiful amen changes things let's look at this now the four seal brother Brown brother Rand puts it this way how anyone can get the church going to the tribulation I don't know and we're going to talk more about the tribulation in a moment um what it's got to go through the tribulation for when it hasn't got a single sin I mean I don't mean the church the church will go through the tribulation but I'm talking about the bride amen and and I had done some research and I knew because a lot of my research uh and a lot of what I read and and listen to and uh is is a lot from 63 to 65 now I do listen to others but the majority of uh if if I do a search I start actually I start from like 60 the last quote that would involve something uh and work my way backwards because I know that as brother Ram's Ministry matured uh there was things the Lord showed showed revealed to him later in his ministry especially after the were revealed that he did not know earlier or that he might have had a little different take on it at the time amen so as his ministry matured God revealed things to him uh he put things in different context so I would start with the last so when I do that I start with the last and walk forward well in doing that I notied obviously through the last three years of his ministry brother bam re separated the church and the bride early in brother Ram's Ministry he conflated them just like scofi and so many others they were they believe the church believed that they were one the same body But as God began to reveal this to him around about the time that the seals were open were revealed right about that same time is when is when brother brandom started seeing recognizing that there was a that they were two different groups one came out of the other the bride came out of the church but they were two separate groups the church was one group the church through the church ages and then the bride the bride inside each one of those Church ages there was a bride and there's two and there were two separate groups and brother B started recognizing that so as he's talking in the for seal you can't obviously because like I said from what I saw and could find that was about the same time that brother Brown be to divide the two so you can't blame him for at first saying the church going to the tribulation amen because this was something that the Lord had just put in as a revelation to him in his ministry that that the church and the bride were separate amen that's why you see brother random catch himself here he says I don't mean the church I mean the church will go through the tribul ation but I'm talking about the bride the bride does not go through the tribulation praise the Lord as he said what does she have to go through the tribulation for yeah amen amen we'll talk about that in a minute the bride the bride won't no it hasn't got a sin against it at all it's been bleached out and if you're a member of that bride you are a part of that word amen he says the bride but you're a part of that bride yes praise the Lord that means I'm a part of that word yes amen it's done been bleached out there's not even a smell of it not even a smell of it amen there's nothing left there you're perfect before God perfect before God now he doesn't say you're perfect before your mirror or you're perfect before those that are around you but you are perfect before God praise the Lord amen amen so what's any tribulation uh what's any tribulation to purify them but the others do amen the church now I'll read this I I I want to come back to this thought but I'm going to go ahead and read it here cuz we just read the scripture blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin um the church does go through the tribulation but not the bride the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride and he goes on to talks about Noah going through the tribulation but Enoch representing the bride who raptured before the tribulation Noah went through the tribulation the cross on top crested the way aves if you will went over every tribulation that there was and made it onto the other side of the tribulation amen that was that was a type that he had of course uh that we know is obviously a part of a a part of the word now obviously there's there there's a purging period yes there has to be a purging period for everyone yes everybody that that ex that expects to have be in this life there has to be a purging period you have to if you're going to get into that life there has to be a time of purging in your life you cannot live the way you were born and be a Christian I just say it simply that way you cannot you cannot live the way you were born and be a Christian you cannot there has to be a purging period there's a Time the bride that purging period for her is the new birth she receives the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit lives in her she she dies to her old self Amen brother Ram talks about the devil writing writing of divorcement putting in the sea of forgetfulness she is divorced her her old her old ways die her old nature dies and she is reborn into a new life into a new nature a new spirit the spirit of God Amen now the spirit of God lives in each individual yes amen you know it by the fruit they bear an orange seed produces an orange tree an orange tree produces oranges you can see it when you walk by it there's an orange tree don't have to guess about it and I'm probably as far from aist as anybody could be but when I walk to my apartment and I see these oranges hanging off of this tree I don't have to wonder whether it's a sycamore tree or whether it's a pecan tree I know it's an orange tree because there's oranges hanging off of it amen I think that pardon the pun in a nutshell is what brother null was trying to get across to us for the a couple of services to recognize it was him and us and if he's in us we do what he did yes we live his life yes amen amen there there's no guesswork I if if somebody recognizes if somebody sees you I know this world is getting further removed from it to where they can't identify it like they used to used to be years ago uh there would be no question you see a Christian it identified itself people look at youday and just think you're a freak you're just a nut you're just crazy person uh you're old fashion living in the stone ages or whatever they want to think they they it doesn't Dawn on a lot of people today that you live the way they do you act the way they do you talk the way you do you dress the way you do because you're a Christian nothing else but because you're a Christian amen you're not crazy you're crazy for Jesus but you're not a nut to the world you are but to us this is the way God's word we conform Into His Image yes into his life likeness not because we make ourselves or put some kind of mask on but because we are bored into it amen an orange tree doesn't go around in the middle of the night trying to find orange tree oranges that another tree dropped and stick them up on his limb so that when you wake up in the morning you think he's an orange tree no he oranges just come out of him cuz that's what he is praise the Lord amen oh it's so it so gets us to the point to understand why uh why things are the way they are why we are the way we are why we do what we do why we live the way we live and act the way we Act and why the world acts the way they act why they do the way they do but now our purging comes when we we have a new birth the new birth takes place in us we repent God fills us with his baptized in the name of Jesus Christ filled with his spirit and when the spirit comes and God and begins to grow that that seed that life in you begins to grow and it produces Jesus Christ amen amen I'm not calling myself Jesus Christ but that seed will produce Jesus Christ amen that's why so many people believe brother Brandon was God to this day because they conflated the understanding of of a carnal interpretation of a spiritual Revelation they they they looked in and they said wow that's just I I see the scripture living again this must be no it wasn't is God in a man just like it's God in us amen but it's like brother no said the most perfect example that we've had In Our Lifetime is William Brown the most perfect example of Jesus Christ I've ever met or ever known I didn't meet him but ever known heard affiliation of some sort was William Brams only one I know of closest one I know but every one of us are striving to get to that place yes amen we want to we desire to it's in our hearts to want to but now the other group they have to be purged at a different time amen and that's what the tribulation is for the tribulation the Great Tribulation serves two purposes it's a judgment on the wicked and it's a purification of the church it's a it's a judgment on the wicked which it will be a judgment that will lead up to the white Throne judgment and it is a purging time for the church it's a purging time for the Jews it's a purging time for those who did not get their purging by the new birth amen that's why you see uh uh that's why you see the foolish virgin the way they are we'll read that in a minute but let me read this first first John I'm going to read I've read this several times here over the past few months and I told you before the Lord just keeps bringing me back to the scripture so I'm just as long as he keeps bringing me I'm going to keep reading it amen who who whosoever committs sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law for if you do not believe if you do not believe then it's not going to pertain to you amen if if you don't believe that that the government means what they say when they put a 45 mph speed limit stick there out here if you don't believe that and you just go 100 and they stop you you're going to do whatever you want because you don't believe it if you don't believe Christ if you don't believe his word then why would you obey something you don't even believe right why would you try to conform to live in something that you don't even believe amen amen they don't believe whosoever committed sin unbelief right transgresseth the law just their simple unbelief is a transgression of the law for sin is the transgression of the law and ye know that he Christ was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin right praise the Lord that's why he could take our sin away whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth has not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous even as God is righteous let me read that again little children newon Ben it Newton don't let any man deceive you he that does righteousness amen is righteous right praise the Lord what is righteous Christ the word amen he who does lives why the word is righteous robed in his righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish praise the Lord the bride who is she she's the sinless Bride of Jesus Christ yes cannot cannot cannot be a sin accounted to her God will not will not put a sin on your account praise the Lord even as he is righteous praise the Lord thank God for that he that committed sin is of the devil if you don't believe you're of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning although the devil believes amen uh kind of puts a little twist on that here because sin is unbelief but the sin but uh the is of the devil the the devil sinth from the beginning amen that is to disregard Satan knows God there's he believes in God probably more than most people Satan believes in God but he doesn't believe who God is right doesn't believe in the the uh omnipotent almightiness of God of he is he is the soul or is to be the soul object of worship which is of God for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy unbelief or the works of the devil sin that's why he was born now to some that has taken place to us that has taken place the works of the devil in your life has been destroyed in the bride The Works of the devil have been destroyed because you cannot sin praise the Lord hallelujah you cannot disbelieve thus God will not put a sin on your account hallelujah amen praise the Lord that's our that's happened through the manifestation God himself in flesh revealing himself to us coming in human flesh coming in the form of the Holy Ghost now to live in us to prove that he is still God he's still the same yesterday today and forever manifested destroy the words of the devil now in a lot of people The Works of the devil still manifest they still work but in the bride and those that have been purged those that have received that atonement they have been purged they to them the destroy the works of the devil have been destroyed whosoever is born of God and again always go to the ninth verse because this always ties it up for me the ninth verse whosoever is born of God does not commit sin amen for his seed God's seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God I'm sorry friend but you can no more sin disbelief than God can right can't do it you can make a mistake in your flesh you can think something your flesh your spirit your human Spirit your human body you can react in a certain way that's ungodly that's the human nature of you amen we try to suppress that as much as possible and let the Lord live his life through us so more of us can die amen but that's not what he's talking about amen he's talking about the seed that remaineth in you that's God's that's what God's looking at God's not looking down and seeing how well you combed your hair this morning amen God's not looking down and seeing what color clothes you have on how well that you uh present yourself all that's just a reflection of who you are of course but that's God's looking down and he sees the soul of man he's looking down and he sees the soul in you that the seed of God is there he he sees his own reflection yes Amen in you his own reflection yes praise the Lord amen now let's go over to Matthew chapter 25 I want to finish this up now that brings us again him the understanding of why why we are considered a sinless people why the bride is considered a sinless people not without fault or mistakes but sinless why is she considered sinless because of the new birth yes the new birth reconciles all that to understand that's who we are that's right it's a new birth that makes you sinless which which means what it's not you it's him because the birth is his birth in you so it's not you anyway you accepted it you received it we all have our free moral agency of course we can decide to not to whatever but God is the one that that has brought all this plan around to make it work and live in your life that's how you're sinless amen amen the church has not reached that place the church did not re does not not reach that place here mean that's why the church goes to the tribulation that's why the church does not go in a Rapture the Rapture is solely for the bride God's wife solely for the bride amen let's read uh we've gone through this many times Matthew 25 the 10 virgins and keep in mind now remember keep in mind the purpose of the of the tribulation uh I was going to read uh Revelation 6 again but we'll maybe next time we'll see uh we're we always go through uh most of the time when the when the seals are preached on Revelation six preached on we go through the fourth seal and we stop because that ends the church ages because we're we're bride and after that you know the bride goes in a Rapture she's no part of the rest of it the fifth seal is soul under the altar are the Jews they're not just Gentiles anyway Saul's on the altar crying uh how long Lord those are Jews not even Gentiles and of course the Sixth Seal is the is the Tribulation period tribulation period for judgment on the wicked amen judgment on the wicked but it's also a time of purification you ever heard brother Brown talk about how these and we we'll read it here but these These Foolish virgin they have to they have to seal their testim because they have a testimony of Jesus Christ notice Let me just read it then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be liken unto 10 virgins which took their lamps went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps amen not just their lamps but their vessels as well the wise while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept they all slumbered and slept at midnight there was a cow made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out so obviously they had oil obviously they had the Holy Ghost but they only had an anointing of the Holy Ghost their lamp amen the thing that shines out a lamp is something that people see when you when you you ever heard anybody say their light their smile lights up a room yeah your lamp amen not your spirit not your soul your your your your outer being is your lamp your smile lights up a room your presence brings other people Joy whatever that's the light lighing up a lamp so they had oil in their lamps on their flesh but it was simply an anointing they obviously were not born again right they weren't born again because they didn't have something out inside them continuing to keep them going uh from the soul Spirit body so when their anointing went out when the anointing Liv Ed when the anointing was no longer present they had no oil right they had no Holy Spirit and they were but they were smart enough to ask the wise give us of your oil our lamps are gone out if they had been born again their lamps would not have gone out just to have a simple anointing is not enough Saint amen just to have a nice tingling on the flesh or a nice feel to say oh I like this group of people or boy this is a good place or just feel the tingling or something or just an anointing of some kind of speaking in tongues or prophesying or something that's just a gift that doesn't mean that you're born again doesn't even mean you're a Christian amen amen but they were virgins they were virtuous now notice all 10 of them had not defiled theirselves with any man with any Doctrine with any church with any Dogma they stayed pure amen so so even though the the foolish virgin even though this church uh has to go into the tribulation it's simply for purging it's not for judgment it's for purging am because they did not receive the Holy Spirit they got an anointing but they didn't have the Holy Spirit but they were a group that was still a virtuous fruit they still claim Jesus Christ they still believed God they still believe truth they they they they maintained their their spiritual selves amen and I'm not talking about virtuous as in physical virtu I'm talking about spiritual virtue am they were spiritually virtuous they had not defile defiled their spiritual uh uh uh lives with Dogma with with church church or or or some kind of Dogma or man-made idea they did not defile them defile themselves spiritually they stayed virtuous the only difference was they did they they weren't born again yes amen they received a nice anointing on the flesh but they were not born again their lamps went out they asked the wise give us some of yours but the wise answered night ver saying not so lest there not be enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to by the bridegroom came brother maram talked many times about that church going to try to search that oil to search the new birth amen the church does not get it uh but they but they'll they'll go searching for it they'll try to find see how this how this works uh uh where this comes from how this comes about Amen brother raham talked about going and looking searching for this they went to buy the bridegroom came and they were uh and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but the Rapture had already taken place the door was shut Rapture was gone the brides out of here the Christian virgin bride is gone those that were left are either the ones that are in judgment or being purged and we can you can read the end of Matthew 25 and you can see where at the white Throne judgment God separates the two groups amen those that were being judged go to his left hand and they get cast into Everlasting fire those that don't go to his right hand and they're and they're granted eternal life amen we find that group again Lord willing next Sunday we'll find that group again in MA in in Revelation 7 but let's continue on here the door was shut 11th verse now afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us they still were a group that was calling him Lord but I want you to notice something as I finish verse uh 121 13 look here but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye neither know the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh but I want you to get something re uh uh verse 11 and 12 afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verely uh said verily I say unto you I know you not now I don't not I do not want you to get this group confused with the with the group in Matthew 7 uh 2122 2 and 23 do not conflate those two groups do not get those two group they are not the same group Amen in Matthew 7 2122 23 a group comes and says Lord Lord haven't we done these great works haven't we done this that and the other haven't he said depart from me ye workers of iniquity I never knew you he does not say that here right amen he does not tell the five foolish I never knew you and if you go look at the new and no KN and e w k and o w is two completely different Greek words you can look them up two completely different Greek words some of the subtext is a little the same but they have two different meanings I never knew you as in relationship is one group that God said you are working iniquity I never knew you as in relationship right amen never in this group that I know you not is is that no means if you will uh it basically means I'm ignoring you he's not telling them I I never knew you right he's just telling them I'm not paying attention to you right I'm ignoring you why would God do that amen well why did God do that when they were banging on the door Noah to try to get in oh we're sorry we're sorry we're sorry let us in we repent we repent no it's too late but we're here now we believe we want in no too late it's too late they come to him and say Lord let us in no it's too late you had your chance uh uh I'm I'm pardon this but I'm ignoring you I'm not listening to you right too late you had your chance it's over yes and that's that is the justice and Judgment of God yes that's just God is is is is perfect he he is a god of Mercy a god of love a god of Grace but he's also a god of judgment and he's a god of his word yes amen and and and that is where he's established and when it when when the line's drawn and the door is shut it's shut you don't open it amen it's done but it does not mean that this this group of people is lost completely to the Lake of Fire like the other group when he says I never knew you right depart from me workers of iniquity I never knew you two different groups yes two different things yes amen amen this group will come up later but they come up later at the end of this chapter actually which did separates the sheep from the ghost they come up later but they don't come up until after the tribulation period so the bride now revelation of Matthew 25 the bride has gone into the Rapture door is shut and the church excuse me the church the foolish virgin they go into the tribulation period yes amen and they have to seal their testimony with their own blood right they have to be purged yes amen at the end of the tribulation period which we may talk about again a little bit later I don't intend to get into the Jew part of the the Jewish part of this quite so much but at the end of that is when uh in fact I um uh most definitely will uh the it it becomes a purging period for the Jews too remember we went through that before and and the sixfold uh vision of Gabriel amen finish the transgression yeah we'll get into that again but it it is for for the Jews too but it becomes a purging period the tribulation becomes a purging period for those who were not born again amen amen that's why they don't fall in the same category as the bride that's why they don't reach the same statue status as the bride amen that's why the bride goes through goes into the Rapture not the tribulation and the church goes through the tribulation the bride does not need any purification because there's not one smell of sin about her amen praise God there's not one sin held to your account yes not one praise God so what does she have to that's why we read I read this why brother R said why does she got to go through the tribulation she's perfect before God why does she she doesn't need any purging amen the two purposes of the tribulation judgment and purging and neither one does the bride fit in that's why why would she go through the tribulation amen Amen brother Aram talked about why why uh why a man would love a woman so much that he would want to make her his wife and then and then take her home and then beat her to a pulp I love you honey you're such a sweetheart why would he do that he doesn't right that's the whole point he doesn't there's no purging the bride has to go through that's why that the bride goes into the Rapture amen the church does not she has not received the Holy Spirit she's got to seal her testimony amen look now seven seal now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that don't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way they were blinded false prophets didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart well of course the bride the Bible calls them virtuous amen virgins they stay pure yes and God knows their heart and here they're purged purged during this time what time tribulation yes sealing their testimony with their own blood you notice that another purging time that's for Israel when she gathers now he's talking about the Jews here that's the second fold God purges Israel in that tribulation period amen amen praise the Lord amen thank you Lord let me read just one more I'm going to skip some here amen let's get to this we'll close here and you got to remember too now during this tribulation period there is this the there are no more anointings people talk about well they went through the Dark Ages and they had this and seal their life and stuff but they had an anointing that anointed them they they had a protection they had a keeper that anointing the Holy Spirit was there there will be none when the tribulation sets in no anointing No Love No peace no joy no no Holy Spirit no anointing amen the spirit goes back to the Jews the Jews are the ones that have the Holy Spirit God's dealing with them at this time Gentiles nothing dead empty this church has to go through this purging period with absolutely no anointing it sounds uh it sounds bad but that's just the fact of it people say well maybe they're foolish virgins oh have mercy Lord no why would anybody want that yes amen I mean that's better than going to hell but uh who would want to go through the tribulation period amen amen this purging time where there's there's no anointing then during the tribulation amen read this let me read this one more no no he said let me see we're U this is a question and answers uh number 392 I like to say that in case anybody's WR down or wants to go look it up no no no you're I wish that I could have more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church the bride taken from the church then the church age will cease leoda goes into chaos uh he also talks about leoda going into predition amen it it runs itself out into Armageddon and so forth the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy three and a half years second half of Daniel 70 weeks then tribulation set it upon Israel then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroys the whole thing right amen the bride does not go through the tribulation Church does separation those that that have been born again and those that have not yes amen God brings a complete distinction between the two amen that the bride she goes into she goes into the Rapture yes that's what we're waiting on the bride is waiting on a body change she's waiting for that time which I believe all of us would agree this right at hand she's waiting for that time looking longing Lord just any day now amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen praise the Lord you love the Lord amen so glad what do we say so glad I belong to him amen so glad I'm his amen let's sing this maybe we maybe I'll just sing the chorus of it here uh if I can find it 579 just any day now praise the Lord 579 I don't want to
