[37:18] and needy father
[37:19] we're just believing today that your
[37:21] hand is upon all the requests and all
[37:23] the needs
[37:24] lord we just give you thanks and praise
[37:25] lord because we can have faith to
[37:27] believe
[37:27] that you said it lord we can't might not
[37:30] can put our finger on it we might not
[37:32] can scientifically or medically prove it
[37:34] but we know by faith god that it is a
[37:36] finished word yes
[37:37] and we just give you the glory for it
[37:39] now in the name of the lord jesus christ
[37:41] we pray
[37:42] amen amen amen genesis 18 we'll read one
[37:45] verse
[37:46] and then we'll let you be seated that
[37:49] one verse
[37:50] verse 14 genesis 18 14. it says is
[37:53] anything too hard for the lord at the
[37:57] time
[37:57] appointed i will return unto thee
[37:59] according to the time of life
[38:01] and sarah shall have a son amen you
[38:04] could be seated if you will
[38:06] amen if you haven't figured it out
[38:08] already by the scripture reading i just
[38:10] titled this today
[38:11] is anything too hard for the lord amen
[38:14] amen is anything
[38:15] too hard for the lord let's go back to
[38:18] uh
[38:18] uh the first verse of genesis 18. i want
[38:21] to read through this story and we'll
[38:22] touch on abraham and sarah for a little
[38:24] bit
[38:25] and background the understanding that we
[38:27] have through the word of god through the
[38:28] message and
[38:29] through the teachings that the lord has
[38:31] given us about this that god is coming
[38:33] to sarah to understand
[38:35] uh why that god would tell her amen god
[38:38] would tell abraham
[38:40] and sarah because these are god's words
[38:42] god said this
[38:43] as we read through this again you'll
[38:45] recognize god's the one that said this
[38:47] god
[38:47] is questioning them is anything too hard
[38:50] for me
[38:51] is anything too hard for the lord amen
[38:54] and that's the question that po is posed
[38:56] to us today
[38:57] because that that reality
[39:01] is the basis upon what our faith is
[39:03] based on
[39:04] if we believe that there's something too
[39:07] hard for the lord then our faith isn't
[39:09] going to rise to the place it needs to
[39:10] be
[39:11] to garner what we need from the lord but
[39:14] if we truly believe and know that god
[39:16] can do anything that god can do all
[39:19] things and that he does do all things
[39:21] and he is more than able to do anything
[39:24] whatever you would say
[39:25] ask abundantly beyond what we could ever
[39:27] think
[39:28] then our faith can rise to that place
[39:30] and that level
[39:31] to receive that amen amen we know god is
[39:34] already able
[39:35] i mean i i know i'm preaching to the
[39:37] choir here today but just something
[39:39] simple to
[39:40] encourage your faith today we know he's
[39:42] able we know he can't do anything
[39:44] but the point of it is our faith needs
[39:47] to reach that level
[39:49] our faith needs to go to where that is
[39:51] into that dimension
[39:53] and receive that for ourselves amen it's
[39:56] already there
[39:57] we know it already exists we know god
[39:59] has already done it we know god's
[40:00] already purchased it
[40:02] he's already done the plan that was
[40:03] needed to bring it to pass
[40:05] it's just us and our faith getting to
[40:07] the level to receive it amen amen just
[40:09] like
[40:10] he was doing to abraham and sarah here
[40:12] because this was going to be quite an
[40:13] outstanding thing
[40:15] that was going to happen to sarah
[40:17] sarah's 90 years old do you imagine
[40:19] thinking about giving getting a promise
[40:21] from god at 90 years old that you're
[40:23] gonna
[40:24] conceive and have a son right i mean
[40:27] even by those days standards that was
[40:30] outstanding
[40:32] uh so to be able to reach the level of
[40:35] faith that
[40:36] that was needed for that to take place
[40:39] it had to be something happened there
[40:40] with abraham and sarah
[40:42] and of course to get to that place where
[40:44] god can make it happen
[40:46] in their lives in the same thing today
[40:49] abraham and
[40:50] sarah weren't facing anything any
[40:52] different than we do today
[40:53] they were facing the same thing they
[40:55] were humans they had a
[40:57] free moral agency they had a soul body
[40:59] spirit they had things in the world
[41:01] going on around them and
[41:02] no doubt the way things are today may uh
[41:06] play more into weakening humans faith
[41:09] but still it needs to be reached to the
[41:11] place that
[41:12] god is because god hasn't changed amen
[41:15] everything around us
[41:16] has changed and humans have changed the
[41:17] people's shakes but god hasn't changed
[41:20] so to reach to that place where they
[41:22] reach to we got to do the same thing
[41:24] yes amen be the same faith reach to that
[41:27] same place now
[41:29] as we go back and read beginning of the
[41:30] first verse
[41:32] and the lord appeared unto him now we
[41:34] know of course
[41:35] let's just background before we start
[41:37] reading again just to refresh your
[41:39] memory
[41:39] uh we know that abraham had married
[41:41] sarah and
[41:43] his name was abram and herz was sarai or
[41:45] however you want to pronounce her name
[41:47] i've heard it pronounced several
[41:48] different
[41:49] ways we'll just say sarai because it
[41:51] ended with an eye so abram and sarah so
[41:54] he married sarah then god
[41:55] came to abram and said if you'll get
[41:58] yourself out from your fathers and your
[42:00] kindred
[42:01] i will make you a great nation and now
[42:03] notice
[42:04] abraham was 75 years old when god's
[42:06] giving him this promise the bible says
[42:09] he was 75 when he left out from his
[42:11] father's house
[42:12] so as he was 75 years old to receive
[42:15] this promise
[42:16] that god said i'm going to make you a
[42:18] great nation
[42:19] well how can you become a great nation
[42:22] if your wife is barren
[42:23] right right pretty hard to become a
[42:25] great nation when you can't have any
[42:27] children
[42:28] right but god promised him at a 75 year
[42:32] old man
[42:32] i'm going to make you abraham a great
[42:35] nation
[42:35] you get up out and leave your father's
[42:37] house and go into a land
[42:39] that i'll show you god didn't even say
[42:41] okay now
[42:42] go to grant and country club and i'll do
[42:44] this at the other no
[42:45] he said just go and i'll tell you where
[42:48] to go
[42:48] i'll show you where to go i'll give you
[42:50] the direction i'll lead you it's the way
[42:53] that you need to go
[42:54] it was a modern day gps
[42:58] right god was a modern day gps for
[43:01] abraham
[43:02] he was the global positioning system
[43:05] that we follow on our phones and
[43:06] everything today
[43:08] sometimes we get i think people be
[43:10] completely lost without them right but
[43:12] god was abraham's gps oh man
[43:16] you just go and i'll tell you where to
[43:18] go i'll tell you where to turn
[43:19] i'll tell you what land to go to i'll
[43:21] tell you where you need to end up
[43:23] i'll tell you where you need to uh
[43:25] occupy and that that that's what god and
[43:27] that was god's promise to abraham and
[43:29] i'll make you a great nation
[43:30] amen i promise you i'll make it this is
[43:33] my covenant to you
[43:34] i'll make you a great nation so abraham
[43:36] leaves
[43:37] he goes out but abraham stays barren
[43:41] all this time abraham or excuse me sarah
[43:44] stays barren this whole time
[43:46] no children they have relation husband
[43:48] and wife no children
[43:50] but god's promise didn't change because
[43:52] sarah didn't have any children
[43:54] you understand the promise of god did
[43:57] not change
[43:57] amen brother branham tells us that
[44:00] abraham's faith got stronger
[44:03] believing that the same god that
[44:05] promises the same god that's delivered
[44:07] and there's the same god that's taken
[44:09] care of
[44:09] is the same god that's going to produce
[44:11] this and make this promise come to pass
[44:13] america same god and the longer it goes
[44:16] the greater
[44:17] miracle it's going to be amen it's a
[44:20] miracle at 65
[44:21] but what kind of a miracle is it going
[44:23] to be when she's 90.
[44:25] amen hallelujah or 100 or whatever it's
[44:28] going to be at that time
[44:29] abram didn't know right he just believed
[44:31] it he said god
[44:33] i'm just going to trust you but there's
[44:36] times
[44:36] you read through the story there's times
[44:38] you go from genesis 12 to genesis 18 19
[44:41] 20 or there's what we consider as
[44:44] humans to look at a lack in abraham's
[44:47] faith
[44:48] but i challenge you today to the fact
[44:52] that that's not the account that
[44:54] god had about abraham because god's
[44:57] account of abraham
[44:58] he tells us in romans and in hebrews and
[45:01] other places of the scripture
[45:02] that tell us of what god saw in abraham
[45:06] amen and god said he wavered not amen
[45:09] hallelujah
[45:10] that's what god said we look at it and
[45:12] we read the story
[45:13] you you go and read a 16-17 chapter
[45:17] it even says that abraham himself
[45:19] laughed within himself yeah
[45:21] that's right that's what the bible says
[45:24] abraham laughed within himself
[45:26] but god's account of abraham was that he
[45:29] staggered
[45:30] not right amen that's what matters
[45:33] doesn't matter the way we look at it
[45:35] doesn't matter the way we see it matters
[45:36] the way god sees it amen amen
[45:38] how god accounts it to our account how
[45:41] god sees it us and his own eyes
[45:44] that's what we need to think about worry
[45:46] about the most how god sees it
[45:49] so god or abraham even abram even
[45:51] laughed at himself
[45:53] but as the years went on the faith grew
[45:56] stronger
[45:57] as years went on abraham questioned
[46:00] even after god gave him the promise
[46:04] abram question god god what will you
[46:06] give me
[46:07] seeing i go childless well amen
[46:10] abram i've already told you i'm going to
[46:12] make you a great nation you've obeyed my
[46:15] word you followed what i told you i told
[46:17] you what i was going to do
[46:19] you did what i asked you to do now i'm
[46:21] going to do what i told you i would do
[46:23] amen period there is no question about
[46:26] it there is no backing up from it
[46:28] i told you this and it's going to happen
[46:30] but yeah abraham comes to god said well
[46:32] god what will you give me seeing i go
[46:34] childless i've already told someone to
[46:36] make you a great nation
[46:37] right right so he had to take him out
[46:39] and of course you know the thing where
[46:41] god
[46:42] puts asleep on him divides the animals
[46:44] and the birds and all in the
[46:45] the lamp comes down and and then god
[46:48] tells him
[46:48] and and has to change abraham's name
[46:52] or abram's name to abraham and sarah's
[46:54] name to sarah
[46:56] you know it was nice to have the name of
[46:58] of a father
[46:59] as abrams was but it was even greater
[47:02] for him to
[47:03] have the name of the father of many
[47:05] nations all right amen
[47:06] praise the lord it's one thing to be a
[47:08] father it's another thing to be a father
[47:10] of many nations
[47:12] god changed their name before the
[47:15] promised son to
[47:16] come to pass now the 18th chapter says
[47:19] this the lord appeared unto abram
[47:21] now this is after that all the promise
[47:23] god told him
[47:24] i'll do this i give this and of course
[47:26] the uh
[47:27] the the the uh the
[47:30] the what do you call it the the the side
[47:34] act a side shoot of ishmael coming forth
[47:37] sarah goes uh to hagar her handmaiden
[47:40] that they had gotten out of egypt
[47:42] and said now uh you go unto my lord and
[47:45] and have pleasure with him and
[47:48] and you can have a child by him right
[47:50] amen that that will be
[47:52] from his lawns see but i want you to
[47:55] understand
[47:55] something yes you look in the bible
[47:59] and you see where god calls these men to
[48:01] do these specific things and
[48:03] to create these uh these lineages
[48:06] but if you notice god also calls the
[48:09] woman amen
[48:10] god doesn't just call the man god also
[48:13] calls the woman
[48:14] and god did not call hagar that's right
[48:17] god did not call any of his concubines
[48:19] or anybody else
[48:20] right god called sarah for abraham
[48:24] amen god called sarah to be a part of
[48:26] that promise god called her
[48:28] to produce that promise her and her
[48:32] only and it was the production or the
[48:34] producing of abraham
[48:36] and sarah that come together to produce
[48:39] isaac
[48:39] and then nothing else was going to work
[48:42] nothing else was going to do
[48:44] of course the ishmael came forth from
[48:46] from hagar and it was from abraham's
[48:48] laws but it wasn't the promised child
[48:50] amen in fact god said i will make
[48:54] ishmael a great nation because of your
[48:57] asking me abraham but he is not the
[49:00] promised child
[49:02] so much so that when it come time to
[49:05] offer
[49:06] isaac as a sacrifice and type of jesus
[49:09] christ
[49:10] god told abraham to take your son
[49:13] singular your only son is
[49:16] singular god didn't even acknowledge
[49:20] ishmael
[49:20] right right he only acknowledged dicey
[49:23] because that was the promised god that
[49:25] uh the promise of god that was the
[49:27] lineage
[49:28] that god was bringing forth to make of
[49:30] him great nations
[49:32] not just nations but great nations
[49:35] amen not just multitudes of people but
[49:38] multitudes of god-loving god-fearing
[49:41] great nations
[49:42] amen praise the lord that's god's
[49:45] promise
[49:46] god was going to bring that promise to
[49:48] pass god did bring it to pass now after
[49:50] all that
[49:52] god comes into the door of abraham's
[49:55] tent
[49:56] abraham looks up and he sees them coming
[50:00] and he goes running let's just let's
[50:01] just read it see because because see
[50:03] god's getting ready to do something else
[50:06] god's already changed their name to
[50:07] abraham and sarah
[50:09] okay so that that's already been done
[50:11] that's the promise god gave them
[50:13] of what he was going to do now he gives
[50:15] that again as a reassurance to abraham
[50:17] as you'll notice we read
[50:19] but the purpose of course like brother
[50:21] branham said that
[50:22] that that god had to going to abraham
[50:25] here on this occasion
[50:27] was that god in himself was
[50:30] shall i hide what i'm about to do to
[50:34] sodom and gomorrah this great thing
[50:36] that's about to take place
[50:37] shall i hide it from my prophet shall i
[50:41] hide it from my servant the man of god
[50:43] that i have here on earth right now
[50:46] shall i hide this great event from him
[50:48] and of course
[50:49] absolutely not god said no no he can't
[50:52] hide this from his prophet he can't hide
[50:55] this from his man of god
[50:56] so he's going to go down and tell him
[50:58] this is what i'm about to do abraham
[51:00] after everything else that goes through
[51:02] we won't read that part but
[51:04] god is coming to tell abraham what he's
[51:06] about to do to sodom and gomorrah
[51:08] and of course the two angels go down
[51:10] there and get lot and his family out
[51:12] first
[51:12] right because lot and his family had to
[51:14] get out of there first
[51:16] before god could bring down the fire and
[51:17] brimstone but now the lord appeared
[51:20] 18th verse first for 18th chapter first
[51:23] first
[51:24] the lord appeared unto him in the plains
[51:27] of memory
[51:28] and he sat in the tent door in the heat
[51:30] of the day he lifted up his eyes and
[51:32] looked and lo
[51:33] three men stood by him and when he saw
[51:35] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[51:37] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[51:40] and he said my lord amen singular
[51:44] he wasn't acknowledging the other two he
[51:46] was only acknowledging the elohim
[51:48] whom he had acknowledged and seen before
[51:52] this melchizedek without father and
[51:54] mother that
[51:55] that abraham had paid tithe to that had
[51:59] met him after the victory of the
[52:01] slaughter of the kings
[52:02] amen this was the same one and he said
[52:05] my lord
[52:06] now the other two of course brother
[52:08] brahm talks about gabriel michael a
[52:10] couple angels he
[52:11] blows them dust and they step into and
[52:13] they come forth to abraham but
[52:15] abraham is only acknowledging the one my
[52:18] lord amen
[52:19] my lord if now i have found favor and
[52:22] thy sight pass
[52:22] not away i pray thee from thy servant
[52:26] let a little water i pray you be fetched
[52:28] and wash your feet and rest yourselves
[52:30] under the tree and i will fetch a morsel
[52:32] of bread and comfort you your hearts
[52:34] that ye shall that that ye shall pass on
[52:37] for therefore are ye come to your
[52:39] servant as they said
[52:41] so do as thou has said now god said that
[52:44] go and do as you said now
[52:47] that that's the way it should be every
[52:50] time god passes our way
[52:52] amen every time god passes our way now
[52:54] you know job said he passes right by me
[52:57] and
[52:57] i perceive him not uh he comes in the
[53:00] lightning he comes in the thunder he
[53:02] comes and
[53:03] the the whirlwinds and all the great
[53:05] things but you know just in the
[53:07] quiet and secret places he just in
[53:10] in the subtle ways that god comes by
[53:12] there should always be a welcoming
[53:14] there should always be the lord let us
[53:16] set out the table before you
[53:18] lord let us get the very best that we've
[53:21] got and give it to you
[53:22] lord may we have everything that we do
[53:25] be exactly perfect so that you will be
[53:27] pleased
[53:28] with our offering that we offer you
[53:30] today and please
[53:31] don't leave right away stay a little bit
[53:34] amen
[53:34] just stay a little bit lord let's just
[53:36] have a little communion
[53:38] let's just have a little fellowship lord
[53:40] let's talk
[53:41] just for a few minutes could you spare a
[53:43] few minutes he lives in eternity friend
[53:45] don't you think he can spare a few
[53:46] minutes to talk to his children
[53:49] amen just a little bit god just just
[53:51] stay a little bit i'll make
[53:53] just welcoming and wash his feet amen
[53:55] make sure he feels welcome
[53:57] don't just invite him there's a lot of
[54:00] places a lot of churches a lot of people
[54:02] invite him
[54:02] but he'll come and they don't make him
[54:04] feel welcome right
[54:05] and they come and he comes he might even
[54:07] come and be there in their event
[54:09] but he sets over in the corner of jesus
[54:11] with dirty feet
[54:12] right they don't make him feel welcome
[54:14] right abraham made him feel welcome he
[54:16] washed his feet
[54:18] and he fed him look how fresh this meal
[54:20] is no
[54:21] look at this abraham hastened to the
[54:23] tiana de tierra
[54:24] and to sarah and said make ready three
[54:28] measures uh
[54:28] quickly ready quickly three measures of
[54:31] fine meal
[54:32] knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
[54:35] and abraham
[54:36] ran unto the herd and fetched a calf
[54:39] tendering good and gave it unto the
[54:41] young man and haste to dress it
[54:43] you talk about a fresh meal right i
[54:45] don't know if you've ever gone out to
[54:47] eat or if you go
[54:48] go out after church or something i doubt
[54:50] very seriously that when you set down
[54:52] for your meal
[54:53] there's a guy in the back running out to
[54:55] go get the calf to dressing
[54:57] to give you that meat that that five
[55:00] minutes ago was grazing in the pasture
[55:03] this is some fresh meat friend this is a
[55:06] fresh meal that that abraham has chosen
[55:09] the very
[55:10] best to give to god this is pretty fresh
[55:13] i think we have some uh sometimes a meal
[55:15] we think is very fresh but i tell you it
[55:17] doesn't get any better than this
[55:19] yes amen he ran out and got it gave it
[55:21] to the young man
[55:22] hastened to dress it took butter and
[55:24] milk and the calf and
[55:26] he had dressed and set it before them
[55:28] and he stood by them under the tree and
[55:30] they did eat
[55:31] and they said unto him where is sarah
[55:34] thy wife
[55:35] and he said this is he now this is the
[55:37] fellowship god's pleased
[55:39] right god's been made welcomed he's
[55:41] sitting down he's feeling comfortable
[55:43] he's been fed his feet have been washed
[55:46] there's a nice
[55:47] atmosphere amen and that's what that's
[55:50] what we create in church that's
[55:51] that's the whole point we have a song
[55:53] service and we try to create an
[55:55] atmosphere so we try to make him welcome
[55:57] and
[55:57] wash his feet and make him feel welcome
[55:59] and comfortable and
[56:01] and we're here together and we feel
[56:02] comfortable together and we feel that
[56:04] spirit
[56:05] we feel that anointing sweeping through
[56:07] the congregation and
[56:08] and we feel how god's moving upon each
[56:10] soul and upon each heart and
[56:12] he begins to minister to us and speak to
[56:14] us and and
[56:16] individually amen and just and this
[56:19] just begin to talk to us and that's
[56:21] where god is at now with abraham he said
[56:23] where is sarah thy wife
[56:25] and he said behold in the tent and he
[56:28] said i will certainly return unto thee
[56:29] according to the time of life and lo
[56:31] sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[56:34] sarah heard it in the tenth door which
[56:36] was behind him
[56:38] now abraham and sarah were old and well
[56:40] stricken in age
[56:41] and it ceased to be with sarah after the
[56:44] manner of women so people may say well
[56:46] sarah wasn't that
[56:47] old for those days she was only 90 when
[56:51] people were living 200 and 300 years old
[56:53] but once you see what the bible says the
[56:56] bible says
[56:58] she was past that time right he said
[57:00] well 90 wasn't that old for those days
[57:03] but the bible says she was past that
[57:05] time of age
[57:07] right that's what the bible says so if
[57:08] the bible says that that's what i'm
[57:10] going to believe
[57:11] yeah 90 was old even then for someone
[57:14] a woman to conceive and to bear a child
[57:17] right man
[57:18] she was of old stricken in age
[57:21] and it ceased to be with her as the
[57:24] manner of women
[57:25] amen bearing children therefore sarah
[57:28] laughed within herself saying
[57:30] after i am waxed old shall i have
[57:33] pleasure with my lord being old also
[57:36] now i want you know abraham laughed
[57:40] when god told him that now sarah's
[57:43] laughing
[57:43] both of them in their heart you know the
[57:45] bible says abraham laughed within
[57:48] himself
[57:48] amen and said within himself how could
[57:51] we do this
[57:52] being old people now now sarah's doing
[57:55] the same thing
[57:58] sarah is laughing with her within
[58:00] herself
[58:01] and and she said shall i surely bear a
[58:04] child which
[58:04] am old um
[58:08] there laughs within herself let's go
[58:09] back 12 for saying after i am
[58:11] waxed old shall i have pleasure with my
[58:13] lord all being also
[58:14] old also and the lord said unto abraham
[58:18] wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i
[58:20] but surely bear a child with
[58:22] him old is anything too hard for the
[58:25] lord
[58:26] amen is anything too hard for the lord
[58:30] so that's the question today
[58:32] that's the question that our faith needs
[58:34] to reach
[58:35] that's the question that we need to find
[58:38] within ourselves to understand
[58:40] no matter what situation you're in no
[58:43] matter what physical condition you're in
[58:44] no matter what's going on in your life
[58:47] no matter what misdirection or misguided
[58:49] or whatever
[58:50] whatever it is is there anything too
[58:53] hard for god
[58:54] amen that's the question you have to
[58:56] answer
[58:57] in your own self right is there anything
[59:00] too hard for god and don't
[59:01] try to put it off to say well maybe it's
[59:04] this or maybe it's that don't
[59:06] god can do anything that our faith can
[59:08] reach to right amen
[59:09] yes anything amen if we can have faith
[59:13] to move a mountain
[59:14] and take mount lemon and put it in the
[59:16] pacific ocean
[59:17] then there's nothing that god would
[59:19] withhold from his children
[59:21] right amen god can do anything amen amen
[59:24] praise the lord is anything too hard for
[59:26] the lord
[59:26] at the time appointed i will return unto
[59:29] thee according to the time of life
[59:31] and sarah shall have a son
[59:34] no question about it great now i want
[59:37] you to see the difference
[59:39] between abraham and sarah abraham
[59:43] laughed in himself and said how could we
[59:45] do this
[59:46] but acknowledged god after he left
[59:49] right but now what did sarah do sarah
[59:53] denied
[59:54] saying i laughed not for she was afraid
[59:57] and he said
[59:58] nay but thou didst laugh sarah
[1:00:02] lied to god abraham did not
[1:00:05] rhema they both laughed and they
[1:00:08] and but abraham acknowledged what he had
[1:00:10] done and god
[1:00:11] explained to him what he was going to do
[1:00:13] sarah lied to god
[1:00:16] and brother branham said god would have
[1:00:18] destroyed her right there
[1:00:19] if she had not been a part of that
[1:00:21] promise amen if she had not been a part
[1:00:23] of abraham
[1:00:24] part of that promise just like eve in
[1:00:26] the garden of eden just like
[1:00:28] the woman amen she wasn't eve at the
[1:00:30] time
[1:00:31] she didn't become eve until she was
[1:00:32] pregnant with twins right amen amen
[1:00:35] because that's when she became the
[1:00:36] mother of all living right
[1:00:37] but then she was the woman god would
[1:00:39] have destroyed her
[1:00:41] if adam had gone down and take her into
[1:00:43] himself and became a part of the curse
[1:00:46] amen just like jesus came down and
[1:00:48] embraced you
[1:00:49] and became a part of the curse actually
[1:00:52] literally going to hell
[1:00:54] but praise god when he got there he took
[1:00:56] the keys of the kingdom and emptied out
[1:00:57] paradise
[1:00:59] and set it up on high and gave captivity
[1:01:01] kevin uh
[1:01:02] led captivity kevin gave give son to men
[1:01:05] amen
[1:01:05] amen praise the lord now sits at the
[1:01:08] right hand with the book in his hand
[1:01:10] ready to claim that that belongs to him
[1:01:12] right america praise the lord praise god
[1:01:14] but now
[1:01:14] abraham brother man said god would have
[1:01:17] destroyed sarah for lying in the face of
[1:01:19] god
[1:01:19] amen and she was a part of the promise
[1:01:22] and he couldn't take her without hurting
[1:01:24] abraham
[1:01:24] amen without uh uh
[1:01:28] negating the promise that god had
[1:01:29] already given abraham because the
[1:01:31] promise wasn't for any other woman
[1:01:33] again wasn't for hagar it was for sarah
[1:01:35] amen amen
[1:01:37] praise the lord it was only for sarah
[1:01:39] amen she denied said
[1:01:41] uh not because she was afraid amen amen
[1:01:45] i mean that that that's a legitimate
[1:01:47] human emotion and we shouldn't
[1:01:49] we shouldn't be afraid but we are
[1:01:51] sometimes that's right amen whether we
[1:01:53] want to acknowledge it or not we are at
[1:01:54] times there's
[1:01:55] times that we are that we become afraid
[1:01:57] amen as young children and
[1:01:59] afraid of the dark as older people
[1:02:01] whatever things it is it's different for
[1:02:02] different people
[1:02:03] a lot of times it's dictated your fear a
[1:02:06] lot of times is dictated by your
[1:02:08] upbringing right how you're raised in
[1:02:10] the home that you grew up in a lot of
[1:02:12] times
[1:02:12] because those things carry on in your
[1:02:14] spirit
[1:02:15] to your adulthood right and your
[1:02:17] adulthood and
[1:02:18] it affects you that way so you know
[1:02:20] people can say i never get afraid people
[1:02:22] you know it's a legitimate human emotion
[1:02:25] she
[1:02:26] actually was exercising a legitimate
[1:02:28] human emotion because she was afraid
[1:02:30] there
[1:02:31] she said nate but god said but now you d
[1:02:33] you did laugh
[1:02:35] you did laugh it was in your heart but
[1:02:36] you did laugh see god
[1:02:38] discerning the thoughts in her heart in
[1:02:40] the tent behind him
[1:02:41] right that's right amen that's when a
[1:02:43] prophet of god in this day could turn
[1:02:45] his back to a congregation
[1:02:46] and call out this one and that one and
[1:02:48] say this is what you this is where
[1:02:50] you're from this is your name this
[1:02:51] what's wrong with you
[1:02:52] and all the with in the ten now he said
[1:02:54] now you see your last sign
[1:02:57] amen amen before the destruction of
[1:03:00] sodom and gomorrah
[1:03:02] god turned his back to the tent amen and
[1:03:04] discerned what was in sarah's heart
[1:03:07] right in this last day a prophet of god
[1:03:10] sent by god turned his back to a
[1:03:13] congregation and said
[1:03:14] called out people and said now you're
[1:03:16] seeing your last sign what is left
[1:03:18] friend
[1:03:19] the destruction of this satan's east yes
[1:03:21] amen we're facing
[1:03:22] the the the resurrection of our children
[1:03:25] of our
[1:03:26] of our families i say children because
[1:03:28] of our son i guess but
[1:03:30] it could be any of us or families the
[1:03:33] resurrection of our families that we'll
[1:03:35] see before us in a minimum of 30 days
[1:03:37] we'll be gone
[1:03:38] amen because there's a body change
[1:03:40] that's about to take place
[1:03:42] a body change that's about to happen to
[1:03:45] a to a group of people around the world
[1:03:47] there's a body change that's about to
[1:03:49] take place that this bride
[1:03:51] is in the moment and twinkling of an eye
[1:03:53] going to take on
[1:03:55] the moment and twinkling of an eye you
[1:03:57] you think what kind of faith that that's
[1:03:59] going to take
[1:04:00] but now my question is as we change this
[1:04:03] here today
[1:04:05] and let's leave abraham and sarah now uh
[1:04:08] you go back in hebrews and i had hebrews
[1:04:10] i was going to read here and
[1:04:12] how uh um well we got a minute let's
[1:04:15] just read it real quick
[1:04:17] uh hebrews 11. and we'll we'll just
[1:04:19] change this over
[1:04:20] hebrews 11 11 says through faith
[1:04:23] even though she laughed god's account
[1:04:27] in the hebrews 11 11
[1:04:30] through faith god calls her faithful
[1:04:34] praise the lord through faith sarah
[1:04:37] herself receives strength
[1:04:39] to conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:04:42] child when she was past
[1:04:43] age because she judged him faithful
[1:04:46] who had promised amen god
[1:04:50] taking abraham and sarah and changing
[1:04:52] them back
[1:04:53] to a young man and young woman again
[1:04:56] receiving
[1:04:57] strength receiving because see
[1:05:00] her woman dead her milk veins dried up
[1:05:03] she wasn't she was beyond the place of
[1:05:05] receiving seed
[1:05:06] she was beyond the place of having a
[1:05:08] child she was beyond the place of having
[1:05:11] uh to be able to be able to feed the
[1:05:13] child
[1:05:14] all this had ceased with sarah so sarah
[1:05:17] had to receive
[1:05:18] something you say uh brother branham and
[1:05:21] and i'll just be honest with you i have
[1:05:23] heard and know people in this message
[1:05:25] that don't believe it when brother
[1:05:27] branham said they were turned back to
[1:05:29] young one
[1:05:30] young man and young woman again i
[1:05:32] believe it
[1:05:33] amen amen i believe it i believe him as
[1:05:36] a prophet of god i believe him as the
[1:05:37] vindicated word prophet for this day
[1:05:40] that i know was wrong a dramatization
[1:05:43] but i also know it was a type
[1:05:45] and it was a type of what the bride is
[1:05:47] facing today
[1:05:48] it's a bright it's a it's a type of what
[1:05:50] this bride is about to go through right
[1:05:52] now
[1:05:53] i believe very short order this bride is
[1:05:56] going to be facing the exact same thing
[1:05:59] yes it says she receives strength
[1:06:02] but she received so much strength
[1:06:06] you said well her body was strengthened
[1:06:08] but she received so much strength that
[1:06:10] she was a beautiful woman again
[1:06:12] because when her and abraham went down
[1:06:14] to the career
[1:06:16] of benellect the king of guerrero wanted
[1:06:18] her as a wife oh man hallelujah
[1:06:20] you mean a 90 year old grandma well she
[1:06:22] wasn't grandma she had no kids but a 90
[1:06:24] year old woman
[1:06:26] now wanting to be desired of a king that
[1:06:29] probably could have had any woman in his
[1:06:30] kingdom he wanted
[1:06:32] that's right any woman that came into
[1:06:34] their kingdom he could have had it if he
[1:06:36] wanted her
[1:06:37] but he chose sarah a 90 year old woman
[1:06:40] who was past the age of bearing yeah
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:44] no sorry friend that doesn't work that
[1:06:47] way so what she just received
[1:06:48] strength no she received a body change
[1:06:51] right now
[1:06:52] she received something that made her
[1:06:53] desirable to the king of the country
[1:06:56] amen amen and it wasn't just because she
[1:07:00] uh was uh a female because like i said
[1:07:04] he could have had any woman he went as
[1:07:05] the king of the
[1:07:06] he's the king of grier could i didn't he
[1:07:07] want anyone amen
[1:07:09] but he chose sarah right of all the
[1:07:12] others he had
[1:07:13] don't tell me people say well i don't
[1:07:15] believe that well you can believe what
[1:07:17] you want friend
[1:07:18] but i believe what the word said right
[1:07:19] amen
[1:07:21] and it says that she was so desirable
[1:07:24] god had changed her body so much
[1:07:26] she became desirable to that king right
[1:07:28] right god had to come to abimelech and
[1:07:30] tonight
[1:07:31] and say you better not touch that woman
[1:07:33] oh man that's right
[1:07:34] well he said she was his sister yeah i
[1:07:37] know
[1:07:38] you did this the integrity of heart but
[1:07:40] if you don't take that woman back to his
[1:07:42] uh her husband you're gonna die right
[1:07:44] you and everything that's around you is
[1:07:46] gonna die if you don't
[1:07:47] you don't even touch her you take her
[1:07:49] back so
[1:07:50] he lied to me it don't matter right
[1:07:53] your great prophet lied and you're okay
[1:07:56] with that
[1:07:56] that's not the point my promise doesn't
[1:07:59] change
[1:08:00] because he lied to you right
[1:08:03] amen my promise doesn't change just
[1:08:07] because he lied to you praise god
[1:08:09] you better let that take that woman and
[1:08:10] bring him back to and have him pray for
[1:08:13] you
[1:08:13] you mean that liar is going to pray for
[1:08:15] me yep you better have him pray for you
[1:08:17] because if you don't if he doesn't pray
[1:08:19] for you you're a goner
[1:08:20] right amen amen that's
[1:08:24] praise the lord that that that's god's
[1:08:25] word amen
[1:08:27] turn back to a man to a a man and woman
[1:08:31] enough to be able to conceive
[1:08:33] to bear and to have a child a son and
[1:08:36] raise
[1:08:36] isaac to the place that that he would be
[1:08:39] the lineage
[1:08:40] of abraham amen receive seed
[1:08:44] she believed it she had faith he
[1:08:46] believed it he had faith
[1:08:48] their faith reached to that place amen
[1:08:51] their faith
[1:08:52] reached that place is anything too hard
[1:08:54] for god
[1:08:56] their faith reached to that place and
[1:08:58] they and they conceived and bear a son
[1:09:01] the promise of god could come forth
[1:09:04] because of their faith amen they got the
[1:09:07] they got
[1:09:08] all hebrews the eleventh chapter the
[1:09:10] faith chapter
[1:09:11] all the way from the eighth first down
[1:09:14] that's the eighth first to the 19th
[1:09:17] verse
[1:09:18] it's about abraham and sarah amen the
[1:09:21] faith
[1:09:22] to be able to bring the promise to pass
[1:09:26] and how many other promises of god how
[1:09:28] many other promises
[1:09:29] in this bible do we have
[1:09:33] our faith is what it takes to bring it
[1:09:35] to pass
[1:09:37] our faith is where we have to reach to
[1:09:40] to make it happen
[1:09:41] in our lives amen our faith just like
[1:09:45] theirs
[1:09:45] it had to be the same place at the same
[1:09:48] time so yeah
[1:09:49] fear is a real emotion but faith
[1:09:52] always conquers fear amen i'm in you
[1:09:55] hear me today
[1:09:56] faith always conquers fear yes
[1:10:00] always always has always will amen
[1:10:03] amen now in that great event
[1:10:08] the great faith that that that that this
[1:10:11] bride today has got to have
[1:10:14] to bring this great event to take place
[1:10:18] let's go to uh ephesians
[1:10:22] and i want to transition from genesis to
[1:10:25] ephesians
[1:10:26] ephesians chapter 4.
[1:10:35] there's a word in ephesians 4
[1:10:38] that means the same thing as genesis 18
[1:10:42] 14. it's that time of life
[1:10:48] the time of life there's that time of
[1:10:51] life
[1:10:52] you can say it and believe it in many
[1:10:56] different
[1:10:56] ways facets whoever you are
[1:11:00] this bride for the last time for this
[1:11:02] last days
[1:11:04] there's a fulfillment there's a
[1:11:07] there's a ending of times and it's not
[1:11:11] necessarily
[1:11:12] time itself but a specific
[1:11:15] time element because
[1:11:18] as god told abraham and sarah
[1:11:23] according to her time of life according
[1:11:26] to the time of life that god had
[1:11:27] predestined
[1:11:29] god was going to visit them god was
[1:11:32] going to bring them together
[1:11:33] she was going to conceive seed there's
[1:11:36] going to be a time
[1:11:38] there's got to be a time according to
[1:11:39] the time of life
[1:11:41] that they reached this place see amen
[1:11:44] and a lot of it
[1:11:45] my opinion a lot of it had to do with
[1:11:47] the faith that they had that that it
[1:11:49] reached to that place
[1:11:50] to produce that seed amen amen you
[1:11:53] remember
[1:11:54] brother animals had this girl in the
[1:11:57] prayer line and she came up and
[1:11:58] he asked her do you have faith she says
[1:12:01] oh yes brother brandon i believe
[1:12:03] and he said just go sit down over here
[1:12:06] just a little bit
[1:12:07] watch the prayer line for a little while
[1:12:09] that's right because he knew
[1:12:10] she didn't have the face she needed to
[1:12:12] reach what she was looking for
[1:12:13] right go sit over there and then come
[1:12:15] back said oh
[1:12:16] i believe now he said just just go sit
[1:12:19] down just a little bit longer
[1:12:20] amen and eventually as her faith grew
[1:12:23] and then she began to watch and she
[1:12:25] began to see god unfold himself before
[1:12:27] and her faith raised to a place he had
[1:12:29] her come up prayed for and god gave her
[1:12:31] what she was looking
[1:12:32] at amen amen it was that time
[1:12:36] i mean it may have taken a little more
[1:12:38] time some people that's just one example
[1:12:40] with others may take even more time it
[1:12:42] was 25 years from the time
[1:12:45] god told abraham that you're going to be
[1:12:47] a great nation i'm going to make you a
[1:12:49] great nation
[1:12:50] it was 25 years before the sun ever came
[1:12:54] before god ever changed their name from
[1:12:56] abram to abraham sarah to sarah
[1:12:59] is 25 years could you imagine the
[1:13:02] promise to say
[1:13:03] god's gonna do this yeah but when
[1:13:05] doesn't matter when
[1:13:07] amen he didn't say when god didn't say
[1:13:09] when it doesn't matter when
[1:13:11] that's not significant all that matters
[1:13:14] is that you believe that it's going to
[1:13:16] happen
[1:13:17] amen god is going to do it period and
[1:13:19] just hold on to that
[1:13:21] i mean hold don't let it go hold on to
[1:13:23] that
[1:13:24] but there's a promise that god has given
[1:13:26] us first thessalonians 4
[1:13:28] that the dead in christ shall ride first
[1:13:31] and those which alive and remain will be
[1:13:33] caught up to meet the lord in the air
[1:13:35] amen there is going to be a catching
[1:13:37] away there is going to be a rapture
[1:13:39] there is going to be a body change for
[1:13:42] the alive and rain
[1:13:43] in this last day amen there's going to
[1:13:46] be a body change
[1:13:47] the moment twinkling of an eye there's
[1:13:49] going to be a change that takes place
[1:13:51] now
[1:13:52] ephesians 4 i had your turn there let's
[1:13:54] go to the 10th verse
[1:13:57] ephesians 4 10.
[1:14:01] he that descended is the same also that
[1:14:04] ascended up far above all heavens that
[1:14:06] he might fill
[1:14:07] all things and he gave some
[1:14:10] apostles and some prophets
[1:14:14] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:18] teachers now what was the purpose of
[1:14:21] this five-fold ministry
[1:14:23] why did god give some upon this earth
[1:14:27] to be evangelists and pastors and
[1:14:30] teachers why did god give that
[1:14:32] what is the point amen because there's a
[1:14:35] reason
[1:14:36] we're not just up here to flap our gums
[1:14:39] we're not up here to build some great
[1:14:40] kingdoms we don't do
[1:14:42] this for uh wealth or fame amen
[1:14:45] we do this because there's a biblical
[1:14:47] reference and purpose by why
[1:14:49] god gives men gifts and why he's made
[1:14:53] some pastors
[1:14:54] and he's made some evangelists and he's
[1:14:56] made some teachers and
[1:14:57] apostles and so forth there's a reason
[1:15:00] why he did that
[1:15:01] amen he did it for the perfecting of the
[1:15:04] saints
[1:15:06] amen amen he did it for the perfecting
[1:15:08] of the saints
[1:15:10] and that word perfecting is the same
[1:15:12] word if you go back to matthew 5 48
[1:15:14] it's the same word where it talks about
[1:15:16] that perfect is being
[1:15:18] of full age mature
[1:15:21] to a place of higher stature higher
[1:15:24] learning
[1:15:25] in the spirit of god you're a mature
[1:15:28] christian you don't let just every
[1:15:30] little doctrine come along and blow you
[1:15:32] all over the place
[1:15:33] you don't let every little thing upset
[1:15:35] you you don't get
[1:15:36] down in every little thing that happens
[1:15:38] in life or what somebody might say to
[1:15:40] you or
[1:15:41] how somebody might treat you you don't
[1:15:42] let those things ruffle your feathers
[1:15:45] you just move over and press the wave
[1:15:47] and keep on going in the lord i mean
[1:15:49] and that's all that matters yes you keep
[1:15:51] pressing the battle
[1:15:52] that's a mature christian that's someone
[1:15:54] that's a full
[1:15:55] age that's someone that god looks and
[1:15:57] says that is perfect
[1:15:59] i mean that's what god's talking about
[1:16:02] that ministry
[1:16:03] is to bring the word of god to bring
[1:16:06] perfection
[1:16:06] to a bride of christ to bring perfection
[1:16:10] of maturity to a group of people and we
[1:16:13] know
[1:16:14] that romans tells us that faith comes by
[1:16:18] hearing and hearing what the word of god
[1:16:23] not the word of man it's not the word of
[1:16:26] man that does it it's not the
[1:16:29] hibernation
[1:16:30] of god's word by god by uh uh the man
[1:16:34] that makes it it's the word of god that
[1:16:36] brings the faith amen
[1:16:39] the word of god only the word of god
[1:16:42] amen not hybrid not my not my
[1:16:45] or your opinion or thought about it what
[1:16:48] does god say
[1:16:50] amen what does god's word say what does
[1:16:52] god's message say
[1:16:53] what did god tell us in this present-day
[1:16:56] truth amen
[1:16:59] keep going for the work of the ministry
[1:17:04] for the edifying the building up of the
[1:17:07] body of christ
[1:17:09] we nor anyone
[1:17:13] now the the ministry is not here
[1:17:16] to tear down right
[1:17:19] unfortunately in some cases
[1:17:24] there's those that take pleasure and
[1:17:26] tearing down
[1:17:27] right right and tearing other people's
[1:17:30] hopes and lives
[1:17:31] and feelings and faith down that's
[1:17:34] not why we're here amen when i hear
[1:17:37] there's correction that goes forth i'm
[1:17:39] not saying that that's not that's
[1:17:41] absolutely corrections necessary
[1:17:43] absolutely but it should not be to the
[1:17:45] point that it tears someone's spirit or
[1:17:47] unchristianizes somewhere
[1:17:49] amen because that's not what we're here
[1:17:52] for
[1:17:53] the ministry is here to build up
[1:17:56] the body of christ to lift you up
[1:17:59] encourage you to give you the word of
[1:18:02] god the pure
[1:18:03] word by faith to bring you to a place of
[1:18:06] faith that you can receive what god has
[1:18:09] for you amen your life
[1:18:12] now in the future to a rapture
[1:18:15] everything that you need those that are
[1:18:17] dead in christ they had to have the same
[1:18:19] faith
[1:18:20] amen you said well they're dead they're
[1:18:22] automatically going to raise no not if
[1:18:24] they weren't there when they died
[1:18:26] they had to be there first before they
[1:18:28] went on amen
[1:18:29] but let me tell you this alive and
[1:18:31] remain group of this last day god's
[1:18:33] narrowing her down
[1:18:34] yeah she's getting smaller and smaller
[1:18:37] my opinion
[1:18:38] that enliven remain group that will
[1:18:40] actually
[1:18:41] feel that body change it'll take place
[1:18:43] in the moment twinkling of an eye it's
[1:18:45] going to be a small group
[1:18:46] look those that are already gone on
[1:18:48] they've already received their new body
[1:18:50] right they've already received a body
[1:18:52] change they've already experienced that
[1:18:54] they have it they know what it's about
[1:18:56] when they raise they'll be in that body
[1:18:58] but it's us
[1:19:00] it's those that are alive and remain i
[1:19:02] say uh says and i believe we'll be
[1:19:04] partakers of it
[1:19:05] and there may be some of us that go by
[1:19:07] the group i don't know that's god's
[1:19:08] choice yes
[1:19:09] but i believe there will be a group that
[1:19:11] will be
[1:19:12] those that arrive and remain that will
[1:19:14] receive that body change
[1:19:15] amen just like abraham and sarah they'll
[1:19:18] be turned back
[1:19:20] young man young woman they'll see their
[1:19:22] loved ones
[1:19:23] and god will take them home and will all
[1:19:26] and the dead in christ arise
[1:19:27] we'll all get together internationally
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:31] internationally not just in tucson or in
[1:19:33] the united states around the world
[1:19:35] will be gathered on the auspice of the
[1:19:37] shed blood of christ this word
[1:19:39] of god and we'll all go to meet him in
[1:19:41] the air amen
[1:19:42] amen but there's got to be something
[1:19:44] take place first
[1:19:45] amen amen we're to edify
[1:19:49] this body is to be edified not torn down
[1:19:53] not ridiculed made fun of beat down and
[1:19:56] too many defeated and beat down sheep
[1:19:58] now as it is
[1:19:59] this body is to be edified lifted up
[1:20:02] encouraged strengthened amen
[1:20:05] the body of christ now why till we all
[1:20:08] come
[1:20:10] in the unity of the faith
[1:20:13] and there it is unity yes a unity of the
[1:20:17] faith what is this unity it's not just
[1:20:19] this church this city this state this
[1:20:22] country
[1:20:22] around the world god has men and women
[1:20:26] god has children born again sons and
[1:20:29] daughters of god
[1:20:30] all around the world that come together
[1:20:33] under this exact same scripture the
[1:20:36] unity
[1:20:38] of faith a unity of rapturing faith
[1:20:42] we will all have it i
[1:20:45] amen we may differ on a little thing
[1:20:48] here or there
[1:20:48] but we will all have a unity of
[1:20:52] the faith amen a unity of the faith
[1:20:55] that's what will bring us together and
[1:20:57] that's what will take us out of this
[1:20:59] world yes
[1:21:00] a unity of faith we all come together in
[1:21:04] that unity of faith and of the knowledge
[1:21:06] of the son of god
[1:21:08] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:21:11] the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:21:13] of course that perfect that statue of a
[1:21:15] perfect man brother
[1:21:16] was talking about in second peter 1
[1:21:19] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:21:22] why
[1:21:22] we're we're adults amen
[1:21:26] we've been edified we we've we've grown
[1:21:29] we've we've come to a place of
[1:21:31] perfection
[1:21:33] because so we're not children tossed to
[1:21:36] and fro carried about with every wind of
[1:21:37] doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:21:39] cutting craftiness
[1:21:40] whereby they lie and wait to deceive
[1:21:44] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:21:46] up into him in all things which is the
[1:21:48] head
[1:21:49] even christ for whom the whole body
[1:21:53] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:21:56] that which
[1:21:57] every joint supply according to the
[1:21:59] effectual working
[1:22:01] in the measure of every part may get the
[1:22:03] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:22:05] of itself
[1:22:06] in love bringing a body change
[1:22:09] what brought a body change to abraham
[1:22:11] and sarah
[1:22:12] well according to the scripture it was
[1:22:14] their faith yes
[1:22:17] he received god's promise
[1:22:20] by faith believed it she received
[1:22:23] strength
[1:22:24] and received seed to produce the
[1:22:26] promised son
[1:22:28] by faith they both believed it by faith
[1:22:31] they believed
[1:22:32] that their bodies were going to be able
[1:22:34] to produce the promise of god
[1:22:37] now how many of us have the faith to
[1:22:39] believe
[1:22:40] that we have the ability by our
[1:22:44] faith to produce this last day promise
[1:22:46] of god
[1:22:48] a body change amen amen you say well
[1:22:52] it's going to be
[1:22:53] it's going to be great faith when our
[1:22:54] loved ones begin to appear well i'm
[1:22:56] telling you friend if you're not there
[1:22:57] you're
[1:22:58] your loved ones aren't because you're
[1:23:00] not going to see them that's right
[1:23:02] right you've got to be there first
[1:23:04] you're saying oh well you know a ranked
[1:23:06] center sees this and says all of a
[1:23:07] sudden they're a christian
[1:23:09] it doesn't work that way right amen it's
[1:23:12] like
[1:23:12] saying uh well you know um
[1:23:17] i don't pray and i don't read my bible
[1:23:19] and i'm not a christian i don't do the
[1:23:20] things of god and then
[1:23:21] and then when the situation comes and
[1:23:23] arises and they say oh god help me
[1:23:25] where's god amen
[1:23:28] right where is he amen well their faith
[1:23:32] is not there to meet that challenge
[1:23:34] right right now they blame god for it
[1:23:36] because they said well i asked god
[1:23:38] yeah and how did you ask him right
[1:23:42] where were you at the time you asked him
[1:23:44] what was your
[1:23:45] spiritual uh of
[1:23:48] uh life at at that time amen
[1:23:52] you don't you don't have the faith to
[1:23:54] reach that place
[1:23:55] ah man you gotta have the faith when
[1:23:57] when the challenge
[1:23:58] comes you gotta have what it takes to
[1:24:00] meet the challenge
[1:24:02] that's right and that meeting the
[1:24:04] challenge doesn't just happen because
[1:24:06] you sit around and do nothing it happens
[1:24:08] because you're pr
[1:24:09] preparing yourself
[1:24:12] i i don't i don't know anything about
[1:24:15] boxing i
[1:24:16] don't even know who a boxer is anymore i
[1:24:18] guess back in my day is maybe
[1:24:20] uh cassius clay or maybe even sugar ray
[1:24:22] litter but you know
[1:24:24] back in that day if if he was in his
[1:24:26] heyday now if i were to just go say hey
[1:24:28] you know what
[1:24:29] let's have a boxing match together i can
[1:24:31] beat you
[1:24:33] and you just go home and sit down you
[1:24:34] wait for the time to come around you
[1:24:36] walk in the
[1:24:36] you walk in the rink and you get bam and
[1:24:39] you're gone
[1:24:41] you haven't done anything to meet the
[1:24:43] challenge anybody ever done
[1:24:45] anything to train you never done
[1:24:47] anything to get yourself prepared
[1:24:49] to meet this great boxer this man who's
[1:24:53] the champion of the world
[1:24:55] in fact you probably we probably anybody
[1:24:58] that didn't train could go find the
[1:25:01] weakest boxer there is on the planet and
[1:25:03] still get your bell wrong
[1:25:04] that's right you haven't done anything
[1:25:06] right and people they blame god for it
[1:25:09] it's not god's fault
[1:25:10] right amen what are we doing what am i
[1:25:12] doing what is this
[1:25:14] that gods give he he's give us
[1:25:17] everything that we need
[1:25:18] amen to bring us to a unity of faith
[1:25:21] a unity of faith to believe nothing
[1:25:25] is impossible with god amen nothing is
[1:25:28] impossible
[1:25:29] god is already produced and made away
[1:25:32] for us
[1:25:33] a couple of scriptures here i want to
[1:25:36] read to you
[1:25:38] as we finish this because see that
[1:25:44] that body change is simply
[1:25:48] a healing right that
[1:25:51] really is pretty much all it is it's
[1:25:52] just a healing it's just something that
[1:25:54] takes place in your body that brings it
[1:25:56] back from a condition
[1:25:57] that's lower than what it should be back
[1:25:59] to a place where it should be
[1:26:01] amen you know brother graham talked
[1:26:02] about that 19 20 21 years old was yet to
[1:26:05] prime a life and
[1:26:06] uh you know anymore i mean especially as
[1:26:09] a man you're just as dumb as a
[1:26:11] bag of rocks you know 21 year old
[1:26:13] doesn't know nothing
[1:26:14] 20 years old i mean you know the
[1:26:17] reasoning part of your brain hasn't even
[1:26:19] fully developed yet that's why so many
[1:26:20] 20 20 you know
[1:26:22] guys especially do stupid stuff right
[1:26:24] that's right
[1:26:27] apparently some of it never does change
[1:26:29] or never does grow together so there are
[1:26:31] just still stupid
[1:26:32] but that's beyond the point
[1:26:36] but the point is that was the problem of
[1:26:39] life
[1:26:39] 19 20 21 that's why we're going back to
[1:26:42] that age again we get on the other side
[1:26:44] we go back to that age again just like
[1:26:46] we were in the prom of life
[1:26:47] just like it was supposed to be in the
[1:26:49] beginning that's that body change
[1:26:51] i said healing that's that taking it
[1:26:53] back well you know brother adam said
[1:26:56] of course that's the earnest of the
[1:26:57] resurrection even that body change
[1:27:00] that's the earnest of the resurrection
[1:27:02] that divine healing that's the earnest
[1:27:04] of the resurrection
[1:27:06] we had a lot of prayer requests today
[1:27:07] we're looking for divine healing for
[1:27:09] many people's lives maybe for your life
[1:27:11] today
[1:27:12] we may be looking for that divine
[1:27:14] healing brother graham said if there's
[1:27:15] no divine healing
[1:27:17] then there's no resurrection right amen
[1:27:20] that's the earnest of the resurrection
[1:27:23] that's what we look to that's what
[1:27:24] brings this
[1:27:25] body into subjection to the promise of
[1:27:28] god's word
[1:27:30] your faith brings it your faith is what
[1:27:33] brings that promise down
[1:27:35] changes that body that's why brother
[1:27:37] branham said how can we expect a rapture
[1:27:40] to take place we don't have enough faith
[1:27:41] to heal a headache
[1:27:42] tuesday right right amen yes because
[1:27:44] that's just a stepping stone
[1:27:46] to what it will take for to bring about
[1:27:48] the faith for this body change
[1:27:50] amen comes through hearing and hearing
[1:27:53] the word of god
[1:27:55] amen that's why so many people are going
[1:27:57] to be ill-equipped for
[1:27:59] this body change because they're
[1:28:00] listening to the word of man
[1:28:02] instead of the word of god amen they're
[1:28:04] listening to hybridism
[1:28:06] they're taking the scripture but they're
[1:28:08] adding their own thoughts
[1:28:09] interpretations
[1:28:10] dogma to it amen but it's got to be the
[1:28:13] pure unadulterated word of god amen that
[1:28:16] brings this promise to pass
[1:28:18] philippians chapter 3 verse 20 says
[1:28:21] for our conversation is in heaven from
[1:28:24] whence also we look for the savior the
[1:28:26] lord jesus christ who shall
[1:28:28] change our vile bodies that it may be
[1:28:32] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[1:28:34] according to the working whereby he is
[1:28:36] able even to
[1:28:38] subdue all things unto himself
[1:28:42] change these vile bodies amen
[1:28:46] these vile bodies a man changed praise
[1:28:49] the lord
[1:28:50] amen and in a moment the twinkling of an
[1:28:52] eye am i
[1:28:53] praise the lord it's going to change and
[1:28:55] bring
[1:28:57] and bring to pass the promise of god's
[1:29:00] word
[1:29:01] amen one more scripture in jeremiah
[1:29:03] chapter 32
[1:29:06] jeremiah chapter 32 verse 16.
[1:29:11] now when i had delivered the evidence of
[1:29:13] the purchase
[1:29:14] unto barack the son of nera
[1:29:18] i prayed unto the lord saying all lord
[1:29:21] god
[1:29:22] behold thou hast made the heaven and the
[1:29:25] earth by thy great power
[1:29:27] and stretched out arm and there is
[1:29:30] nothing
[1:29:31] too hard for thee amen amen amen there
[1:29:34] is
[1:29:34] nothing too hard for thee great prayer
[1:29:39] let's drop down i was going to read all
[1:29:40] the way through but let's just drop down
[1:29:43] 26th verse then the word of the lord
[1:29:46] came unto jeremiah
[1:29:48] saying behold i am the lord the god of
[1:29:51] all
[1:29:52] flesh is there anything too hard for me
[1:29:55] amen amen now my question again today
[1:29:59] is our faith got to that place
[1:30:02] is our faith is the place that we can
[1:30:04] believe
[1:30:05] we know absolutely we don't guess
[1:30:08] we don't presume we know
[1:30:11] that there's nothing too hard for god
[1:30:13] amen
[1:30:16] whatever you have need of today amen
[1:30:18] whatever you're looking for from god
