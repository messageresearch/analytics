able to go to Sister Green's funeral Tuesday um it wasn't my fault but I apologize for those who tried to stream I don't think this streaming worked out very well I got a lot of negative comments about it it wasn't my streaming it was the streaming of the place so it wasn't a whole lot I could do about it but I noticed um when I was sitting on the on the right hand side facing uh the casket the the lady that the place had the uh had it all set up right here and she went and she fumbled with it she moved it two or three times and she brought it around and she moved it over to the center and she fumbled with it a couple times and she moved it around the other side I thought wow this streaming's not going to be good at all I'm assuming because that had to have been what it was she had a tablet on a stand and uh I'm figuring somehow between all this it just wasn't working so I apologize for that but it was it was a very sweet funeral it actually turned out to be a very nice funeral uh I liked it very much it wasn't uh overly drawn out it wasn't uh nothing out of hand it was just a really wonderful things of course I mean what else could you say about sister green uh it's like I said last week you'd be challenged to find anybody that said anything bad about her and especially anything that she said about anybody but it was a very good it was a very good service most of the family that spoke I was a little surprised that uh some of the people that weren't there but sometimes insinuating circumstances you just never know but but it was a very good it was a very good funeral so I was glad I went I was able to go into the mausoleum I've tried I was as you all know at brother Green's funeral only the family and those that were invited were allowed to go in uh brother Branson tournament so I wasn't one of those invited So and I've tried to go by a couple of times nobody knows this but me and the Lord but as I would drive by I stopped just to see if I could get in to pay my respects to brother green and door was always locked so when when Tuesday when Karen said that anybody's welcome to go I went so that I could go and be there and be where brother green was laid to rest and then sister green and so I was very happy and thankful for that too and got to talk to the family son got to see a lot of people I know got to talk to Sister joy for a bit uh different ones so I was glad I went it was a good it was a very good funeral and very one very fitting sister green and of course her grandson Andrew sang Who's very good voice I enjoy his scene but the person that sang Sister Green Funeral was Sister Green appropriately appropriately so the song I still forget the song a song about us meeting only on their side so it's a part of it is when we all get together amen praise the Lord she's reunited with her husband and the different ones over there so um thank God for that also I meant to mention prayer requests uh very good friend of mine uh passed away this week as well uh Kenneth Greene uh or Kent Green um Walker Kenneth Walker uh passed away you may have heard some of his son's music Kevin Walker I don't know if Kevin's music got out here very much maybe when brother Donnie used to come out in the early days brother Donnie and his and his brother Harry and Kevin Walker used to come and travel all over the place and play and sing and uh brother Donnie would preach was Kevin Kevin Walker's dad he used to come Minister for us many times in Florida and we got to be very good friends and I talked to people to my church and said that he was in failing Health when he called me this past week and said that brother green our brother green brother Walker actually passed away and he is so prayer of course to the family and those behind him his wife Sue who is also not very good health so I meant to mention that as a prayer request so please forgive me but if you remember it was brother Kenneth Walker but his wife Sue and the family so if you remember the newer appreciate that let's stand to our feet if we could foreign turnover in the Bible now again to uh Genesis chapter 3. in Genesis chapter 3 Where We Begin last time Services verse 21. Genesis 3 21 amen praise the Lord before we read the word let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer because Lord Jesus father we're so very eternally thankful God of all the grace and mercy you give us the blessings you bestow upon us every day Lord for the opportunity to be here in your house once again for another Sunday Lord for the health and strength and life and Lord the desire to be in the house of God thank you Lord for this word thank you for the message the truth Lord the revealed word of the hour of God that's the Lord that has been brought to our hearts in this last days that we can look to believe in for us God to bring rapturing Faith to a little group of people who are awaiting your coming Lord all across the world Lord but it's a little group of people that's just in comparison to others just waiting for your coming Lord waiting for you to call us to take us home to be with you Lord we count ourselves as just a small little portion of that group Lord that wants to be a part of that uh in that uh calling Lord want to be a part of that group Lord God may you just help us and strengthen us for the main part of this service Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done we thank you Lord for this time and for this Fellowship for those that have come Lord those who may be streaming bless them exceedingly Lord as we just thank you again and commit all things into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis 3 21. and Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them you could be seated amen I want to go over to Saint John chapter 6. and I want to begin on what what is probably going to be more or less a three-part uh section of the holy spirit that we've been speaking on here um the first part of it that I want to title this is a holy spirit part four and I'll title of this Christ the bread of life amen Christ the bread of life amen of course we know back when God was talking about her when God actually proved the action of taking the Lambs and slaying them and taking the skins and throwing them in was just a foreshadow of what we see that Jesus Christ fulfilled this is a part of that Saint John chapter 6 we want to begin reading verse 28. Saint John chapter 6 verse 28. amen then said they unto him what shall we do now look at what this this is a group of people let me just background you've maybe not read this in a while but uh this is a group of people that's been following Jesus around it's a group of people that were there when he uh the Lowe's one of the times of the Loaves and Fishes uh the times of Miracles that Jesus performed and of course this is a time where Jesus left and got away from them because they said they wanted to make him king or he perceived they wanted to make him a king and uh then he met his disciples one of the times he was walking on the water and he came into the boat and he ended up on the other side and they came and said how did you know basically they're dumbfounded at how Jesus got there because they saw everybody that went on the boats and they saw the boats that win so when they got there they don't they didn't know how he got there and Jesus said you're following me not because of the levels of fishes but because your belly's got full he said but labor for that meat which endureth and continues and so this is the continuation so Jesus let's just start with the 26th verse then uh from that background Jesus answered uh them and said verily verily I say unto you ye seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth it unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give you for him that had uh him hath God the Father sealed and then they said unto him what shall we do amen now this sounds a lot like the Rich Young Ruler an understanding that the these were people living under the law and when you live under the law the whole point of living under the law is trying to live your life and do the works good enough to be able to be considered a child of God to be good enough to find favor in the eyes of God that's the whole thing that they were doing we talked about the sacrificing of the animals the Bulls goats lambs and and we talked about all those sacrifices of the covering but the whole thing of living under the law is trying and working and laboring to try to prove yourself worthy enough to be a child of God amen amen that's what it's all that's what living under the law is that's why you see a lot of people today who still defunctually they still live under the law even though Jesus Christ has came and shed his blood they still love under the law and the whole point is to try to work a work just just to try to present themselves and live their lives and work the work that they can work to be good enough to be called a child of God a lot of people still do that today they're not satisfied with simply the blood of Jesus Christ annihilating our sins and putting us in the in as the family of God right A lot of people want to still have something to do what can I work uh the Rich Young Ruler did that uh all of the law they did that and these and these have the same mentality this group that's following him they see these Miracles and they see all this going on and of course Jesus said labor not for the meat but I want you to see what labor Jesus is talking about what does he mean when he's talking about labor now look Jesus they said what uh what shall we do that we might work the works of God they're trying to prove themselves good enough to be a part of the family of God Jesus answered and said and we all know there's nothing any of us can do amen we can't there's none of us any of us can ever do anything good enough to be a child of God none of us amen the only way that you can be is you're a part of the family of God by a new birth and the Holy Spirit by the bloody shed in Calvary that's only he did it not us but Jesus answers that unto them this is the work now what is the work that God gives them to do they think about sweeping the floor cooking a meal feeding the hungry going to the orphans the widows doing all these works well they're probably thinking what work can I do he said this is the work of God that you believe amen that's the word he just took all the all of the things that they could try to attain to to say look what I did look what I accomplished look what who I am look what I have worked with my hands look what I have got Jesus took all that away from him and said the work that you can do is believe believe that's the work amen believe on him whom he has sent that's the work so what does it do again it takes all the bragging away it takes all the pretension away it takes all that you are good enough to make it out all that is gone all you have to do to work the work of God is to believe on him whom he sent amen believe him in the context of which this is written you receive Christ unto yourself and to receive him is to love him to love him is to obey him amen it's that simple but obedience now this is another thing I don't want to go off on a tangent here because I got something I'm working on but actually obedience is a work of the law you understand you know that yeah and when you when you obey the speed limit out here you're obeying the law it's a work of the law we don't actually uh this may sound tough but we don't actually live the way we live out of obedience we live the way we live because we love it it's not obedience it's a love it's a love affair that we have with God obedience is going back to the law obedience is something that you obey we're not obeying we end up living the way we do but we don't do it out of obedience we do it because we love it amen praise the Lord and love brings us into obedience amen not a law not a law now they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee now they're looking for a sign now Jesus already told them a wicked and adults in this generation seeketh after signs we know he's already told him that but yet they are looking for a sign from him first they want to do a work what can we do that we can be good enough to be in heaven now they're asking Jesus you want us to believe you so look what the context says what signs show us then that we may see and believe thee there's no faith to that or very little faith amen it still has it still takes Faith to believe what you see but it doesn't take it takes very little faith to believe what you can see or touch or hear if it takes very little faith but it takes all the faith to believe something you can't see or someone you can't touch or someone you can't hear audibly amen that's what faith is but what they're wanting is to get something they can see to believe well that is Con that is absolutely contrary to what Jesus just said Jesus said that the work of God is to believe on him whom he has sent not a sign not a work but believe have faith amen that's the foundation of our Christian Life is faith Faith but they want to see something what may we see and believe thee and and uh what does thou work again they're looking for these Works they're looking for signs they're looking for signals they're looking for something that's out that's contained in the five senses of our human realm or even the five senses are our spirit Realm they're looking for something tangible and God says and Jesus is telling them you just if you believe me you're just believing amen some call it Blind Faith and they can call it that that's fine I don't have a problem with that why amen but the truth is you believe Jesus Christ you believe God Almighty because you know him and the power of his resurrection and who he is to you not because you could see him touching feel and hear him audibly but you know he's there because of that sixth sense that's inside of you yes it's a sense that that that transcends the five senses the sense of faith that we believe and know that he's there it goes beyond see tasteful smell here it goes beyond imagination cause infection reason memory it goes into the realm of the soul that believes God regardless of whether you can see him or touch him or feeling but that's all that they're looking for we want to touch we want to feel we want to hear we want to see we want something tangible we want somehow that we can believe well if they haven't believed by now and remember this is the group that's been following Jesus this is the group that saw him take the few loaves of fishes and feed the multitudes this is the group that that they didn't see him but knows that Jesus got from one place to the other without getting on a boat he walked across the water yes he walked across the sea he found him in the boat he got in the boat immediately the Bible says immediately they were at the shore where they were going now this is the same group but they're asking now work a work well what have I not done or what what do I need to do to get you to understand but see they weren't Believers to begin with that's why the work he gave them the meat that he gave them was to believe believe on him whom he has sent they said now 31st verse Our Father did eat Manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat amen our fathers now look at this then Jesus said unto them barely verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven what is that that's not just a little wafer that came down and that they got as they were going through the wilderness amen that wasn't just a little uh showbread or something that came onto the ground that they that they could go out and gather and keep this true bread is standing right in front of him amen because he was the bread of life amen but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world which was signified in the bread that he gave them in the wilderness that's exactly what the bread of the Wilder understand God reigned that bread down from heaven and gave it that they could go gather it that they could sustain life it was what they had and God blessed with that in a miraculous way and that even got common to them that even got to the place that they didn't want it anymore they they started calling it this light bread they wanted a different diet they wanted something new something different oh my that sounds like a lot of people today not satisfied with the pure gospel with the word of God the message the truth has come to us an hour they want something different they want something new and there's always a little friend there's always going to be those teachers out there with itching ears it's going to try to bring something else that's new different Innovative uh never saw this scripture before never heard this quote before and always try to swing it around to bring something new and different friend but the truth is the work that you work is to believe on him to believe on him is to receive him and to live his life praise the Lord that's that's the best we can do [Music] for the prayer of God is he which come down from heaven giveth life in the world and they said and said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life you're looking at it I'm here what else can I do to convince you amen he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye all that ye also have seen me and believe not and that's exactly where they stood as unbelievers but Jesus being the bread of life was simply just a manifestation a completion a showing forth of what God continually through the scripture not excluding the showbread uh they showed to them and and manifested to them the foreshadow another foreshadow if you will a Pentecost is in the book of Exodus uh so I'm going to go to Exodus chapter 29. Exodus chapter 29. read the or read the beginning of the first verse but Exodus chapter 9. so Jesus being foreshadowed as the bread of life was nothing new we could see it in the scripture the foreshadowing of Pentecost was not new we saw it in scripture we see it again here we talked about uh of course God slang the Lambs we've talked about the Paschal Lamb uh now I want to talk about the hollowing of the ministry and then the Halloween of the ministry in Exodus chapter 29 this is where Jesus talks about again remember Jesus was the Fulfillment of every one of these scriptural promises yes Jesus was the Fulfillment of every qualification that the Bible gave about who was to come and to give life unto the world that's how Jesus was able to identify himself with with that or to that group he wasn't identified with them but identify himself to that who was because he was the Fulfillment of every single scripture that was wrote about him in the Old Testament the foreshadowing of Jesus Christ Exodus chapter 29. let's look at this first verse and this is the thing now look at God's uh talking to Moses Moses given to the children now this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to howl them to minister unto me in the priest's office so this this process that God set forth was a qualification it was a uh indoctrination or or a Halloween to to bring a position that was hallowed before God and before the people that was acceptable by God now all these things God said in motion God said in place you can read all these things and think well why does this matter and why did he have to do this and why do they have to go there why did it have to be like this because God's the one that said it forth that way it was God's decision to say this is satisfactory for me to come into my presence again this is satisfactory for me for the ministry to minister to be to be hallowed if you will in the position of ministering instead of or in in the place of God that was the position that they were to take see look do what to to hollow them to minister unto me in the priest's office amen simply a foreshadow simply a uh an understanding of what God was doing with them to bring it forth so Jesus Christ became that in that position that fulfillment of that position look at this so let's continue to read now this is going to hollow them what does that just simply means it's going to make it acceptable before God for them to minister unto him in that office amen and Minister unto him by ministering unto his people look now take one young Bullock and two Rams without glitting so we talk about the we talked about the Lambs of the Paschal Lamb and being held up and without blemish and the Perfection of it but now let's get to the bread the howling of the ministry now remember we know Jesus Christ is the high priest right amen amen this is a howling of the priests in this office in this position I believe that's why brother Branham said that uh a minister should never get behind the pulpit without his first met the pillar of fire amen before he's been filled with the Holy Ghost is what he means the Holy Ghost preacher now look uh we got the Bullocks Rams he said now an unleavened bread unleavened bread of course we know the unleavened is the Purity the Holiness unleavened not leavened with anything else anything of the world unleavened bread and cakes unleavened tempered with oil and Wafers unleavened Anointed with oil of Wheat and flour shall thou make them and thou shalt put them into one basket amen one basket and bring them in the basket with the block and the two Rams and Aaron and his sons and Aaron and his sons Thou shalt bring into the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall wash them with water amen wash them with water now let's look at this the as Jesus the bread of life again and the representation of Pentecost here in Exodus look at this for a moment we read about we read Acts chapter 2 last week uh we might actually get to Acts chapter 2 again but Acts chapter 2 uh we talked about this last week but now look at this the unleavened bread cakes that are unleavened and look at these cakes that are unleavened the cake not doesn't say here but the the Performing of this cake that was to be brought forth was to be pierced and and or perforated so this cake was supposed to be uh uh both supposed to be pierced perforated or have scars put in it it was supposed to be scarred and it was supposed to be pierced this cake now this cake is supposed to be uh uh uh represent a new birth amen the unleaveness of the bread the unmixing of the world piers brings new birth as Jesus Christ was pierced at Calvary amen now this unlevious Pierce this cake was to be unleavened and tempered with oil well The Temper well we know what the oil means correct the whole oil means the Holy Spirit it all represents the Holy Ghost this cakes were supposed to be tempered with oil and the tempering process is to take and knead it and mingle it and take the oil and the and the cake to where the two become one that's this process this process of this pierced cake is to take and make the oil and the and the and the cake one the flesh the cake one it was to be tempered together needed together so that you can no longer separate the the the dough the cake from the oil they become one together they come they become synonymous together one as in the Holy Spirit filling them in in uh in this cake which represents of course the new bird yes the indwelling presence of Jesus Christ is what represents the new birth and the new birth is that indwelling presence of Jesus Christ in you Amen in the form of the holy spirit that Holy Spirit coming and making you a new person by it tempering itself in you amen not just a part of your life but becoming your life he is our life not just a part of our lives I've had so many times that people come and say I want Jesus as a part of my life I said go back you're not ready yet amen until you're ready for Jesus Christ to become your life you are not ready yet amen amen I remember a story I think brother random was telling him was going down in a in a baptism line and some lady she cried out or called out to Brother Bear and said hey you're going down the dunkus and she said get out of this line you're not fit to be baptized amen until you're ready until you're sold out to you're dead to yourself and ready for Jesus Christ to take complete control of your life not just a part you're not ready that's what the tempering is that's what the mixing the mingling the the coming together as one means yes to the point again to the point that you could no longer separate the oil from the cake they became one praise the Lord amen now together that represents of course that new birth of the cape piercing the mingling of the oil that's the new birth that's the indwelling presence of God now and the way first now they got Wafers so we got the the cakes unleavened tempered with oil and Wafers unleavened Anointed with oil now he went over the anointing part of it we know the oil again we went over the anointing part we know what the anointing is if you go back and you look in the Hebrew it'll tell you exactly the definition of this word I chose not to pull it out because it's pretty easy to describe when we kind of went over that the other day uh but we know what that anointing is what is that anointing the anointing if you go back and you look actually in the Hebrew definition of this word it means to pour on or smear on amen that's what the anointing means is for that oil to be on the way for uh the the best I felt that I got was the wafer just means the flesh the Flesh of the human is the wafer it's the thin wafer small crusty just like our smoke just our crusty itself is a way for a small crusty uh outside flesh we're all kind of sticky and crusty aren't we uh that flesh and that anointing oil was to come and baptize or smear on or anoint amen now you see where brother Brown talked about the false anointed ones or anointed ones at the end time the anointing that comes on it the anointing that came on these Wafers was something that was smear uh merely smeared on it was baptized with it it was on the outside of the wafer there was nothing about this process that caused the oil the Holy Spirit to come into this wafer it was simply an anointing or a smearing on this wafer that's all it was now you see in grand scheme what God did here he did on the day of Pentecost and when the Holy Spirit came and it came down upon them and in them the exact same thing of the representation of Jesus Christ here as he housed them look you're thinking a a howling of a Ministry to the office of priests to minister to God in that priest office what has Wafers and cakes Got to Do with It yeah it's like we talked a few weeks ago what sense does that make there's still common sense to that what would what would a wafer cakes and what has that got to do with howling a minister to the priest's office but in God's eyes it was nothing but a representation of what he had in his mind was already doing bringing to pass Jesus Christ Pentecost our lives today on into even into the into this friend yes even into this message that we live and hold dear even and from the message even into this day and we live to a rapture amen God foretelling God foreshowing he's got cakes that are mingled or mixed mingled and he's got Wafers that that is Anointed with the oil it's simply anointed look here let's go to Hebrews Hebrews chapter uh four they were hallowed in the priest's office to minister to God and of course then at the end they stood there from the whole congregation and they were washed with water they stood there and the door of the congregation and they had this water poured over them now if that's where Catholics get their holy water from I have no idea uh I don't know any there's no scripture about holy water so the only thing I can think of they got it from maybe is this even though they take this and it's supposed to be holy to sprinkle on people I don't really actually know how that process goes so uh don't ask me but I know about the holy water anyway but they were they were to stand in the door and have water poured over them well that wasn't some holy water you're taking a Shaker and put on everybody that was simply the word of God amen the Waters of Separation The Water of Life amen the water that was poured over them was just it was just a representation of their Ministry of taking the word of God which of course they had and and of course is a foreshadowing of what we have today is simply nothing more than just standing under the spigot and letting you get good and soaked amen of the washing of the Water by the word we got washed in the Water by the word it's the same representation the ministry today amen you find out and you look around the world today you look around you look around the state even the city I don't put anybody else friends but it just becomes clear to me that um a lot of times people aren't as interested in hearing the preaching of the pure unadulterated word as they are a nice social group I'm not in this for social group and I'm in this to be popular I'm not in this to gain some great notoriety or some great Fortune I'm in this because of the calling of God in my life and the washing of the water of the word to preach the gospel I Got No Frills to give you right yeah I've got no great programs or nothing to send you to I'm glad my daughter started the Sunday school that was all her I didn't ask for it I didn't start it she didn't ask me she just felt to do it and bless her for doing it that's wonderful amen I'm glad she did it anything like that uh no Pro but that's I come because of the washing of the word amen hey man that's the responsibility God give me is the passion of this church is not to make sure that you play good volleyball but that you know the word of God and the word of God comes and the Holy Spirit is in you and you live this life out in this world so when it comes time you're ready to go home to be with him am I that's my only concern amen I don't care if you can hit a ball I don't care if you can put a ball I don't care if you can shoot a ball I don't care if you could hit a ball I all I care is if you're bored again amen do you have the Holy Spirit is God Jesus Christ Son of God living in you amen amen that's my main concern washing of the Water by the word praise the Lord washing of the Water by the word there's nothing wrong with the social programs nothing wrong with hitting a ball there's nothing wrong with any of that thing amen but that's not what God sent me to do amen that's not what that's not why God hollowed them in the priest's office God didn't hallowed them in the priest office and washed them with the water and they stepped out and said hey let's start a nice volleyball game now nothing wrong with the volleyball game friend not at all but but that's not the point here right amen the point is to make sure who you are You Know Who You Are amen because there's a very serious thing taking place of a separation of God's people from this world because he's about to take her home yes he's about to take his bride home amen amen and I and I plan to be a part of that and I want you all to be a part of that amen I want everybody to be a part of that you know not just you praise the Lord I want everybody to be a part of that now Hebrews explains very very well to us Hebrews chapter 4. verse 13. verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest praise the Lord amen foreshadowing now we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities there's the double negative uh it just simply means he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are and we know there's no one like that that fulfills that but Jesus Christ nobody else fills that scripture but Jesus Christ above all temptation uh uh and all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need now what was he what is he our high priest he is our great high priest that is simply the Perfection and fulfillment of what we just read in Exodus amen the high priest they were hallowed to be accepted accepted by God to minister to him in that office that was simply the exception God accepted that but Jesus Christ came and the Perfection of the Fulfillment of that now every Minister who Saints every man that tries to stand behind this pulpit must be born again of the Holy Spirit or they are not qualified to touch that gospel that was the requirement in the Old Testament it is requirement today yeah because Jesus Christ our high priest is here now and lives in US and the only way anybody could ever qualify in that position you have to be called of course but you must be born again amen amen if a man stands behind it is not born again well God have mercy I don't know what to say about that amen but that's a that that's a person that can be taken astray that's a person that can be moved inside anybody without the Holy Ghost can be taken astray anybody without the Holy Ghost could be moved decided deceived and and brought to ruin anybody without the Holy Spirit not the Holy Spirit on you amen not just anointed of some gift now there's plentiful of gifts Saints and we're going to talk about that next week I knew I wouldn't have time to do it today I'll probably dabble in in just a few moments if you're okay with that uh but but those but it's not that anointing that anoint to give see there can be there can be a gift there or a colleague there but no repentance uh there there could be a gift there uh the Bible even talks about uh Timothy and his Grandma Lois we know women are to be ministers to have a gift you see people today I I've seen now I I don't make it a habit but I have seen briefly uh a female Minister and mine she just an orchard just lay it right out and and just be as good a preacher as as anybody we're going to order towards anybody but she's forbidden by the gospel to do it yeah yeah so what does that make her where does that put her yeah yeah amen there may be something that was just that was just crawling on her to want to be a minister but it's against the word that anointing would come down and that anointing could come on anybody that's standing behind any Pulpit of any religion this morning the Buddhists the Hindus the the the the the the the the gospels the the the sataness that anointing could follow any of them at any time and speak and talk I mean look look at the the uh politicians today oh some of them up there you they just speak and talk and you see the televangelists you see people that Garner the control over people uh I don't know how much it is today I don't follow it like it used to but back in the day I mean there was the Kenneth Copeland's and and uh I probably shouldn't call names but several Ministries that just got the control over the people amen that's just an anointing friend amen because there there should be there should never be in the place where a minister a pastor has that kind of control over a person yes that's not that is not our position our place yeah yeah amen you have the Holy Ghost you live your life you are before God responsible for yourself and your own not me I'm responsible to this amen I'm responsible for this and of course my own but I'm responsible to this not not other lives but you see that you used to see it I Jim Baker he's passed I think um maybe not I think Tammy did anyway it had control such control over people yeah that I remember I lived in Charlotte when I was there and that's their Ministry was right there and uh I I remember one time where she I mean she was as caked up as any Jezebel you'd ever want to see friend on this on the platform calling out and said I can just see ten dollar bills raining down and and people hundreds of people on the balcony just started throwing money off the balcony such control over people yes that's that is that is not godly yeah yeah but it's an anointing that falls these people are these people are genuine in heart they truly have them feel that anointing falling and and Garner control over these people and and to act that way and to and to do those things and there's no tell us people may not have had another dollar in their pocket amen but that but just Garner that control take control over people and be influenced have that influence over people amen and and that it and it's just as prevalent today you see it today that was probably 40 years ago but you can see that exact same spirit is still out there yes because it's that same anointing um my focus of course God gives us the word amen the word that God helps us with yes amen now let me let me draw this I don't like bringing this over but while we're doing our song service but um some may have may not may may not have seen as I've drawed this before but um we all know that we are we are a Triumph being I know you've all probably most of you've probably seen me draw before we are a body and spirit human spirit and so on amen where Body Spirit and soul so when we're talking about the the anointing we're simply talking about the spirit of God that falls on this outside part of the man let's let's look at let's just look at acts again you can turn there if you want I'm just going to read it acts 2 1. when the day of Pentecost was fully come we talked about that last week they were all with one Accord in one place suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing wind rushing Mighty Wind filled all the house where they were sitting they appeared unto them cloven tongues as we said that cloven is broke out like as a fire and sat upon each of them each of them that were set in there the spirit of God that came this oil this spirit this fire came and lit upon each one of them well when you put something upon something it's simply on the outside or exterior of such thing amen just as it was on their bodies they felt the anointing of that Spirit on their bodies on their flesh the same thing that people feel today people around the world people of all uh uh kindred's tongue Nation people of every religion every Creed color every uh anyone is is acceptable to this anointing that falls because it's a blanket that was upon the Earth remember and in Acts um that's gonna read this later but um let's see if I can find it here if I wrote it down um Acts chapter 2 still verse 17. and as Peter was explaining this to the people this this spirit that came down and sat upon each of them and were filled Peter said this about it and it shall come to pass in the last days quoting Joel saith God I will pour out of my spirit that's the Holy Spirit the anointing the fire the oil I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh not just a believer not just a uh uh a message person but all flesh not soul but all flesh that Spirit fall on all places so when you hear about that spirit and I'm saying would be on anybody that without whatever religion or whatever it's all flesh the spirit would follow All Flesh amen and he has fallen on All Flesh thus we have the anointed ones at the end times the Lord willing we'll talk about next week it is lit upon All Flesh so when it says it came and sat upon each of them all it simply did was baptize them all it did was anoint them but the spirit then came into them and and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost amen when that Spirit came on them and in them they began to speak with other tones and the spirit gave the murderers right but now if Gibson callings over without repentance that simply means that that anointing on that flesh could anoint that guilt even though it may not even be scriptural amen even though it may not even be according to the word that's why brother random said when he had so many people that were copying his ministry and so many people that were making up uh the things that they were trying to do with him and and you'd see the people and I've seen them I I've seen even recently where people have prayer lines and and all of a sudden you see somebody that starts staggering around you know like brother better did on the video another oh my I just I just it just uh Lord help me I I don't want to be overly critical friend but it's that impersonation right that's what brother random fought he said how can you tell how do you know amen you hear something like that it's true or not he said because of the word amen do they preach the word are they on the word then you could know because it's not just on them it's in them a true Spirit the true spirit of God Amen that's falling on All Flesh today a lot of people extremely misunderstood of this this passage of scripture right of this understanding of the Holy Spirit they think the Holy Spirit when brother Madam says um when brother Brown says uh about the dove taking its flight if y'all listen to the message and the places where brother Adam said and that Dove would take its flight you do something wrong or whatever it is something displeasing and that dove will take it swipe and it'll sit on that limb I mean people actually preach or have the understanding that you have your salvation and then you lose it and then you have it and then you lose it you do something wrong you lose it well that's exactly what armenianism is yeah I believe it's armenianism Calvinism one of the two I get the two crossed up sometimes they think well you have salvation one second and then the next second it's gone hey you're born again one second you're in the economy of God the next second you're not you're you're born again a Son of God and at one minute and the next minute you're going 46 in the 45 the dove takes his flight and you die and you're going to hell it doesn't work like that right when brother bam talks about the dove taking its flight it's simply what we were talking about last week with the refilling of the Holy Spirit if you have a new birth and Christ is living in your soul the only thing that can regenerate itself is the anointing of the holy spirit that is upon you that is controlling your spirit and your body amen if the dove takes his flight that means that anointing that is with you takes its flame you don't lose your salvation God does an unsealed the soul and then leave and then come back and seal it back up again well that would be anti-scripture because the scripture says when he seals you you're sealed into your Eternal destination yes amen then how could that be see when he says the dove takes his flight Builders will make you think like well you know if if you don't work the work if you don't go exactly 45 or under you're doomed for hell oh that's just that's just fear that's just trying to live a law that's just trying to obey God in an Obedience of a law to try to be good enough we're not here to try to be good enough right we happen to accept and receive and believe the one that is good enough and he came just like John had the book and said it was nobody worthy but the lamb stepped forth amen amen amen the lamb stepped forth and he was able to take that forward and to loose those seals because he was Worthy the only one that was Worthy amen we're not here to try to be worthy we're here to fulfill the word of God and to live our lives as born-again Christians and to exhibit to let Jesus Christ live his life through US amen amen but the only way he can do it is to be born again yes in the soul a lot of people get a tingling on the flesh or they have a little gift or they speak in little tongues they have a little prophecy or they dance around a little bit or they jump up and down they Shout Scream and all the gifts and things that's wonderful I've seen anointings of that done around the world brother Brown said the heathens could outdo the Christian a thousand to one I probably misquoted that a little bit but the Heathen could do it over and over again and put a sword to themselves pour water through it and call on the devil see us see a pencil stand up on its own and write in an unknown tongue you tell me that's God that's the devil amen and worshiping the devil drink blood he said drink blood of a human skull call the devil amen turn around speak in tongues what are they working under that anointing amen that same anointing the same that was poured out on All Flesh that Peter said it it has and now you see the falseness of it but where there is the false there's because there's got to be a real for the false to come off amen somebody could come up to you and say I got a counterfeit seven dollar bill well you know first of all it's counterfeit because there's never been a real seven dollar bill yeah how could it be counterfeit because there's nothing to counterfeit off of only way you can make a seven dollar pill counterfeit is it's just not backed by the government that's the only reason you can say it's counterfeit because it's not a fake there's not a real seven dollar bill amen there's got to be a real before there can be a counterfeit there's got to be the truth before there's the false amen let's stand if we could I'm going to stop there because I want to finish this well it'll probably take a couple more services finish this because there's a lot that goes into the understanding of that false anointing at the end and Brendan's yeah brother Brown was here and he talked about all the impersonations but it's probably just as prevalent if not more so now than it was then especially after the prophet's gone off the scene and the way people are and trying to make a name for themselves and trying to be popular on TV or try to sell a bunch of books or try to uh have some kind of kingdom of themselves or some big huge church or uh there's all kinds of different reasons amen but the only reason that a true Holy Ghost Field Minister should have to preach the gospel amen the instant in season out of season amen with all long-suffering amen let's sing this course number 424. so glad I'm Yours Lord amen so glad I'm Yours aren't you glad you belong to the Lord Jesus amen thank you Lord let's sing it to him with all of our hearts now are you glad you belonged to him today amen there's plenty of people there's plenty Saints there are plenty of very sincere people out in the world today very sincere about where they go to church or who their Pastor is or or they went and had their walls lined with all kinds of degrees from all kinds of Bible colleges they're just as sincerest they can possibility probably love the Lord amen but I'm so glad that he made me one of his amen that I can know this word that I can

amen but I know she belongs to it praise the Lord so thankful for that for that praise the Lord so glad you belong to him it's so blessed all that bread that was already mingled with oil required another anointing of oil some people don't get that a lot of people the anointing will find out I think it may be next service I'll sing for the Lord lays out he's out see brother Brown said that anointing is simply simply a Causeway for the person of Christ to come and live in you yes amen that baptism was simply something to you allowed the person of Christ to come live in you amen praise the Lord that's what it's all about him living here amen now I got one good amen thank you you love him today [Music] appreciate your prayers again my flight leaves about 2 20. so thank you for your
