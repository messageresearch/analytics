if those circumstances don't don't start moving to pull somebody back it makes me wonder uh if they are really is or not amen because he's always always working on Us Praise the Lord amen to make us

that it's time that they put their dog down so they're supposed to do that Tuesday I know they've had him for quite a while so um it's a blowen anybody's ever had to put a pet down it's not easy sometimes especially one that became so close to the family so uh please remember them in prayer uh pray for sister Julie she text and said she wouldn't be able to make it today um she was going to

her in prayer as well if you would amen anyone else have an unspoken request Lord knows all of our needs today that's all I have written let's stand to our feet if we could just trust the Lord move on everyone of needs request ask for the dentist if you to take Jesus I feel like David said one time I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord yes Jesus and Lord let it speak to our hearts even stronger than ever as you should carry knowing that the signs are displaying itself so clearly that you're coming very soon to assemble ourselves together the more so as we see that day yes yes amen and Lord it's time to really search our Hearts there's uh a a time where we read in your word where uh Joshua was given the promise that no matter what enemy stood before him that you were with him and you defeat the enemy through him father Yes and one day there was a man that thought Gathering a few uh trinkets of a little bit of silver and a and a gold wedge and and a Babylonian garment that it was all right and he brought uh death into the camp and father it's time that we search our hearts maybe there in our hearts there's something that that we try to convince ourselves maybe a a little um dirty movie it won't hurt a little lie here and there you know I'm doing my best oh I God knows I cannot pay my ti well God knows I I cannot uh really pray for someone because I really don't care for them oh Lord these are are enticing Spirits devilish Spirits that's of going against your word and Lord to have your Holy Spirit as to come in full obedience to your word as the prophet said full obedience to the whole word of God en time you to the token and it's time that Lord if there's something that's lacking in our lives Lord reveal it to us because we don't want to miss The R Father we don't want to be left behind yes Lord may you speak to the hearts for them that are not ready to haven't fully uh committed their lives to you that haven't surrender their lives fully to you Lord knowing that if you're not Lord of all you're not Lord at all Lord let us come to that place to a full surrender father knowing that if we miss it it's our fault we're in that basis of free moral agency we make those decisions Lord we think that oh I'm I'm doing fine the Lord's coming his way off I I don't believe he's coming soon oh Lord that's dangerous ground for any believer to think that way yes Lord and Lord speak to our hearts bring us to the place of total surrender full commitment to you that your Holy Spirit may work your life through us and Lord sick among us Lord

it off I have to start doing like brother green how's that now still know maybe I'm not as tallented as I thought brother green had a brand new set of batteries every single service so beginning to understand why here we go I did get it in backwards amen amen start to understand why now thought why we went through a lot of batteries by batteries by the hundreds I guess I understand why you wanted to make sure there was a fresh battery every single service so there it's no uh no foul-ups no uh dying in the middle of service or anything like that so uh anyway so praise the Lord let's turn the scripture now to St Matthew Matthew chapter 6 amen Matthew chapter 6 probably won't be too long this afternoon as I said I'm flying out this afternoon flight leaves at 1:16 so um kind of need to be at the airport by 12 1216 1215 at least by but whatever the Lord amen Matthew 6 want to read one for U this verse of scripture before we let you be seated Matthew chapter 6 amen we're going to begin with verse 16 but before we do just bow our heads for another word of prayer and Lord Jesus so very thankful once again Lord of your grace and mercy your love your blessings to us father where would we be without you God yes it means so much to us to realize what you've done for us God what you went through what you paid Lord what you gave us God and you continue to give us those tremendous blessings God that we are So Unworthy of but Lord you give freely because you love us you give freely God even not just to us Lord you make the rainf on the just and the unjust you make the sun rise on the just and the unjust the beautiful weather and things that Michael was talking about earlier Lord that was for everybody everybody received it but we thank you Lord you give to us God you give to us the desire Lord to worship you and to serve you if you hadn't done that Lord we would have no desire to serve you if you hadn't give your life and shed your blood and come back and redeemed us Lord we would not want to be here today we would not want to serve you we would not want to live for you Lord we would want in every way to live for ourselves like the rest of the world does but Lord we love you and in our hearts our desires God is to live for you and to do only that that would be pleasing to you God may you bless us Lord in this service Lord the reigning part of it God have your will and way may you speak to us from your word once again Lord we are a we are a needy people Lord and we're trusting you God to continue to supply and to bless us in every way God we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done may you accomplish your now this service that that you sent it forth for we'll be thankful God of all you do for us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Matthew chapter 6 uh let's begin with verse 16 Matthew 66 moreover when you fast be not as the Hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily I say unto you they have have their reward but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall we reward thee openly lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rough thus corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen you can be seated if you'd like amen just a simple thought today I want to talk about living for others living for others uh he's not in here yet but um about a month ago me and Joel went to to baseball game here he comes maybe I'll just wait till he gets in here anyway cuz uh a lot a lot of the influence of this message came from him so um I don't he obviously probably doesn't realize that but uh it meant a lot to me but uh about a month or so ago uh me and him and it's kind of become an annual thing for me and Joel we usually go up and uh we go to a game we spend the night and go to the afternoon game the next day and uh we just enjoy our time together and go to the ball game and he likes enjoying watching the game probably doesn't have know anything about it but just being there and cheering just uh he just really enjoyed that but uh this time now not that it's ever been any different but this time struck me more than any other time um I I don't know how well uh all of you know and I'm not GNA keep harping on this point because I want to get to the message but uh Joel is an extremely giving young man uh and and it become becomes more evident to me when we go to a place that the only two people we the only people we know are each other in that entire Stadium there may be 30,000 people there there's players there's men managers there's uh announcers there's people in costumes there's uh cheerleading people there's there's all kinds of varied amounts of people uh but it struck me more this time than ever uh how I see him now developing into a young man reacts around other people and it it impressed me so much more for some reason this time that uh when I came home home I've had I I wrote I had this message I wrote this a month ago uh just waiting to get through what we were doing here to even bring it but it was so inspired me uh when I came back that week that uh the Lord put this message on my heart to live for others um I I I don't know of any other person and I know I wouldn't uh if I when I went to a ball game as a kid uh if I got a foul ball or if a guy tossed me a ball or something I kept it that was my ball I wasn't giving that ball to anybody else Joel finds the first person he can find that doesn't have a ball and he gives it to him and not because it doesn't mean anything to him because it does because one the first thing we do when we get there the first game is go down to the place where all the balls come to try to get a ball but as soon as almost as soon as he gets in fact uh last time we were there uh I'll say this before I act get into the message but um the last time we went we went and uh he got a he's always got a ball every time we go he gets a ball I went to games it it was a thing for me and Tabitha for a while that me and her would go to the games uh years ago when she was younger and all and we never got a ball she can tell you we go we go and we never got a ball every time I go with Joel he gets a ball I and sometimes two or three honestly he'll get two or three balls sometimes and uh he got a ball before I know it we're walking we're we're done trying to get him we're walking up the stairs he sees a girl over there or somebody it's not necessarily a girl but he sees somebody over doesn't have one and one and one's kind of disappointed he goes over and says here you can have this one and I'm just I'm just blown away I go up the stairs and I thought when I was his age I'd have never done that I'm honesty I in fact at my age I don't know if I would do it probably would if I saw a little kid cuz you know it's different now but I have never done that but that's the way he is we go to our seats and it wasn't long that we were at our seats that uh of course I text his mom and told him all about it told her all about it and he said and she so next time he gets a ball tell him to keep it you want that to be kind of a souvenir and so uh sure enough got a foul ball another ball or somebody threw or something and uh we got it uh which again never happened never happened to me before ever but when I go with him happens two or three times every game uh got another one uh got another ball and some guys some younger guys by his AE were set behind us and they were talking the whole game and they kind of made buddies friends and stuff and um and even Joel had had the ball and he said I give it to you guys but my mom's already told me I'm supposed to keep this one so so he kept that one of course the next day he got some signatures on it and stuff but uh but that is just I it it inspired me so much when when I I I got to keep going when an announcer comes by somebody that you seen down on the field give a little announcement they would come by and they would just be walking by right in front of us with the microphone in her hand and he would and he would holler out hey that was some good announcing that you did who does that just being kind yes just being nice you know just that because that's just who he is I I don't think I don't ever think of something like that um some maybe other people do just something simple like that uh and and and a player or a manager or whatever or uh concessions he just gives compliments to everybody just walking by just that good job or something like that and you know it it makes I I'm sure it helps those people to know that there are some even younger ones that care that are listening that uh that appreciate it and I I just can't how but think how much it might make one of those people's day because sometimes you get people down there and they're cheering and they're clapping go debes and all this stuff and people are just sitting there A lot of times and a lot of times nobody's paying attention and they're just cheering our heart out I'm sure that's what they're getting paid for and Joel just stands up and goes right with them and just and compliments them and I think to me that just and he's always been that way I'm not saying this is any time different he's always been that way in fact the last year that we went he got two or three balls over the couple games and didn't come home with any because he gave them all away because he's he's just always that's just who he is uh and again uh I'll probably lead that to rest but it became such an example to me and I started thinking about Christ and I started thinking about uh the spirit of Christ and how the spirit of Christ should be in each one of us and how much the scripture teaches us now this is is a great scripture that of course this is of course I didn't know where to begin I just knew I had a thought that the Lord showed me as an that he my 10-year-old grandson gave me as an example example teaching his grandpa his GRS but look lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth rust uh du corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for your soul Treasures in Heaven amen and see that's that's exactly what I see being done laying up Treasures in Heaven giving to people you don't know giving to people who may hate you giving to people who may not uh uh uh speak bad about you or whatever and and giving just being there to help being there to encourage being there to uh to to be someone to uplift and to edify and it it it makes a huge difference I think uh I'll say this one more thing I think Joel saw uh that girl the next day I never saw her she's about his age and she was over there and she mouthed to him thank you or something I don't think she thanked him when he gave it I think she was so shocked that she didn't say anything and we just walked up the stairs the next day they I guess they saw each other and she said thank you uh and appreciated what he did I I don't know what that meant to that person but you know it's doing something for others living your life for others yes that's exactly what Jesus Christ did but see a lot of times you got to have the heart for others you have to have a heart to give uh you you you have to have the heart to be able to want to give to want to help someone to understand uh that it's it's more precious to give them receive right uh to help others appreciate it or enjoy it as much or more than you do it's like uh it's like the example that brother green gave us about brother bandam and him throwing darts you know and brother brandom uh let brother green win according to brother Green's testimony he basically let him win because brother random hit a bullseye every time he threw the dark so how do you beat somebody like that uh and and he let him win he said well if there's any enjoyment in winning why don't I let you enjoy it right and see that just becomes such an example of living for others uh that makes me think you know uh I I appreciate it I'm glad and I'm thankful to have this ball but maybe this other person would enjoy it too if it's that much enjoyment in it let them have some enjoyment don't know the person from Adam never see that person probably again the rest your life but just giving somebody some a little bit of enjoyment there's got to be a heart there to want to do that there's got to be somewhere that the that that in your heart you want to live your life for others amen remember brother random said you're living life for others you're staring heaven in the face amen praise the Lord let's go over to St John uh chapter 3 as you're turning there I want to read this because again uh it it made me it made me think about Jesus Christ it actually made me think about my own life and and about Christ and about the word uh let me read this quote to you as you're going over to St John chapter 3 let me read this quote that that day on Calvary 1960 he says then what does it do it gives you after that that condition his Spirit to follow uh to follow him and to do as he did for others who is following on he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you yes for me now what must we do see praise the Lord what must we do we must follow in that example he left and gave us an example for us to follow now what must we do we must follow in that example what was that example now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself yes amen amen Jesus never lived for himself why because he had the heart for others yes his heart was for other people his life was to be lived for others not for himself amen but for others what is our example he is well what is that example that he left to us he did not live his life for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life amen look at what brother brandom said that's perfectly eternal life God help me Amen to want to live for other people when you say say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life on eternal life is living for others it proved it when it comes in uh uh when when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others when you receive the spirit of Christ amen it doesn't become about it's not about you anymore amen you start living your life for other people praise the Lord what it means someone said how can you stand that anybody call you such bad names because you don't live for yourself you live for others you might uh that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you're a son taking you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others well brother Bram I can't live for this brother because he sure is uh sure isn't a nice man that's not it amen amen it's not cause the person's a nice person or not that doesn't me see again what does it make for us if we do for those who do for us amen giving was scriptural giving was never meant to be reciprocated yes our giving is not on the value of reciprocity our giving is on the value that we just give period there's nothing to be expected to receive back amen and the the the horrible thing about it and it's gotten to be even more horrible I guess is uh gift giving Times Like Christmas and such become so commercialized that people feel that reciprocity is a part of the process when it should have nothing to do with it amen you should want to give regardless of what anybody else does for or to you it just that that's not the point amen what did Jesus do in his life again remember this example that Gramps received reminded me of Jesus Christ it put my focus on Jesus Christ and how he lived why was he even here right he didn't need to be here he didn't need to be here he didn't need to do these things he didn't need to go through what he did but he did it for you yes amen he did it for me the rottenest most low down scoundrel that ever was born to a woman he loved right and gave his life for me amen how could I then even think about any other in any other way he come to give he gave me well brother ROM I can't live for this brother he sure isn't a nice man that's not it doesn't matter whether he's a nice man doesn't matter whether he's nice to you or not doesn't matter whether he curses you or calls you name or puts you down amen you say how can you do that because you have Christ Living in you because you're a new creature you're not the same old man that you used to be you're not the same person you used to be because you're born again a born again Christian lives a different life yes amen amen their whole life is to live to be edifying to build up to help to increase not to tear down not to rip apart not to denigrate but to build up and to help brother Brown said here live for that man who hates you see you might can help that person someday you might can help bring Redemption to that person's life someday you can't if you put them down you can't if you treat them poorly in fact if you treat them as horrible as they treat you they'll probably never turn to you in the time of need you won't have the opportunity to give to that person amen we've become such a selfish Society yes God help us we become such a selfish me first society and a and a and a society that does not believe the word that does not trust the promise of the word and does not trust God to do what he said he would do amen he said you do for and I will do for you we just read it he said don't be like the publicans who fast and they go around building themselves up like they're some great highest person I've been fasting I've been doing this and I've been doing that for God he said no you give just don't don't make a show of it amen amen God sees it God knows it and God will reward you but see people have lost that they want instant gratification they want instant reward they don't want to wait to get on the other side say laying up Treasures in Heaven well I want my treasures now well you can have them now you won't have any there probably won't even be there if that's your heart and attitude probably won't even be there but you definitely won't have any there amen people want instant gratification I want it now got to have it now no that's that that's not the life of Christ that's not the life he lived amen it's not the life that uh that's not the life brother brandom lived and that and excuse me and I'm going to give him his roses I know he's gone but that's how brother green lived amen Amen brother green had the example of brother brandham and lived the same way the man could have been a multi-millionaire many times over but died in debt now that could be a whole another subject but the point of it is whatever he got usually he gave away right he just did uh and people can uh say it's good bad criticize whatever they want to say they say well you know he he he he did this or talked about that for whatever people want to say about but the man gave I've never seen a more generous man in my life than brother green course I didn't know brother Brown so the most generous man I've ever met in my life because he'd give it away everything he got or most everything he got anyway didn't live in a mansion on the in the Foothills amen if he drove a nicer car it was usually because somebody gave it to him amen that he accepted but it's it's living that kind of life but we become so selfish God help us so selfish that giving seems like a foreign thing anymore sometimes it can just be a matter of giving of ourselves sometimes it could be something as simple as a baseball giving of yourself in prayer giving of yourself in time the most precious commodity we have is the most is the commodity most people take advantage of time that's our most precious commodity and some people don't seem to care anything about time right amen anyway let's move let me finish this quote so we can move on I can't live for that brother he's not nice that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that's a powerful statement that's what they done to him they killed him and he died and he might save them that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then when it's in your bosom you're facing heaven then I guess that's kind of where the quote comes from you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things you give them up amen just like a sheep gives up its wool now going back to Christ St John 3: 16 we all know the scripture very well John 316 first scripture I ever knew when I was a kid growing up at a Baptist Church for God so loved the world that he gave his he gave he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world didn't send him here to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved praise the Lord to who to me to us Amen to those that would accept it to those that would believe those that put him out put him down shunned him ridiculed him didn't want to have anything to do with him amen as we all as Sinners didn't want to have anything to do with Christ leave me alone I'm happy the way I am no I wasn't neither were you people think they are but they're not amen they think they're happy but they're really not only true happiness is in Christ when you get him then you can get happiness but it comes with understanding that it was because he gave he gave to somebody that was unworthy he could have taken our entire race the Gentile race which was a miserable people and wiped every one of them off and said I just start all over again could have done that with Adam in the beginning just wipe it completely off and just start all over but not he had Redemptive values in his character and in that character he wanted to express that he does for us today that that Redemptive virtue character was in Christ come and shine its light so we could enjoy what we understand is the Redemption of being a part of his family brother Brown said we are Sons we are here to be in place of Christ amen now I know that that's what the pope thinks he is but no he's not uh God's children are here in his place we are here to shine and express to the rest of the world that Jesus Christ is still alive that he is still the same yesterday today and forever amen he rose from the dead he's the same God that he has always been there is this thing that goes that has gone around I guess uh I guess it still does I've had it we me and Sonia had it happen to us one time and I thought it was very nice uh that people would do but we got one time one of our times uh when we went to San Diego I was going through a Starbucks to get a coffee and first time that I every remember pulled up and the lady told us the person in front of you paid for your order I thought now see I'll never ever get to thank those people but they weren't looking for things right they didn't want to be thanked they didn't care if they were thanked they didn't care if they ever met me amen I wanted to meet them because I wanted to thank them but I I I've never met them but the only time ever they were long gone by the time we got up there and she told us that amen now on obviously I I don't know that happens like that all the time but uh we turned around and I said well pay for the people behind us I'll never met I never know him never met him whoever it is don't know but I always thought that was such a wonderful thing that kind of got I don't know how it got started but then I'd never been a part of it but I've heard it before like up to 200 people would come through a drive-thru and every one of them paid forward it's called paid forward yeah like 200 people and I think that's just fantastic and then and then I wonder wonder who was the person that stopped it uh but but that's okay cuz it was a give to expect to receive amen the person who paid for it for us wasn't expecting to get receive nor were we amen you can say well your order was only six and there's is 30 don't matter that's not the point right amen point is paying it forward the point is is being there for someone even if you don't know them even if you've never met them even if you will never ever meet them maybe in your entire life maybe they were Christians maybe I'll see them on the other side maybe we'll know I don't know doesn't matter that's not the point the point is paying it forward for someone uh who you'll never know weren't expecting to receive anything in return amen now I'll be honest I have never gone through a drive course how hardly ever go through a drive-thru because I I just don't eat most drive-throughs are fast food and I don't really eat fast food much anymore so I hardly ever go through drive-throughs uh but but I I I've never never started a pay forward I've never been the one to actually start it when you get up there and it's only happened once but when it does you think man that was just really kind to them and it and it makes a difference in your day it really does and I and you hope that it makes a difference for the person behind you if you did something to help that person when you help somebody it makes a difference when you help somebody it it makes a difference in your life right when you give to somebody you don't care whether you get anything in return but when you help somebody or give for somebody it makes you feel good it does Christian or not it I to me Matthew Chapter 5 let's let's go over here now I just got a few very familiar scriptures reading amen there should be again there should never be the thought the expect to receive right I I I think a lot of people sometimes even in church uh may give and they expect they they said well you know God said he would do this yeah yeah he did but you don't give under that premise right amen you give with the with no expectations you give without any thought of well he owes me now no no he does Amen just like any any other point of giving you give not expecting to wonder about getting back you're living for somebody else you're living to make somebody else's life easier living to help somebody else be happy living as somebody else have a little more peace or I mean that's what our government is supposed to do actually president and our federal government is supposed to be there to help our lives it's supposed to help make it easier supposed to give unfortunately and don't know when the change happened but uh it's just the opposite now all the federal government seems to do is take but U anyway it's supposed to be there to help to make people's lives safer you're supposed to feel safer because you've got the backing of the federal government or the state government whatever the backing behind you they'll say well if these people are Bad actors and they're there to do you harm we're going to take them off the street we're going to keep them off the street we're going to try to reform them make them better people if they can uh be done as such have a prison Ministries to help maybe go to church and find Christ something but not be there to harm you so you can feel at peace so you can be happier amen that's what it's supposed to be uh Matthew 5 verse 43 uh we we've read this scripture here recently ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them praise for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now my opinion that's one of the hardest scriptures there are in the Bible that is that scripture I think I even said this before great against the flesh probably is much or more than any other scripture in the Bible amen amen because truth of it is you have heard that ha been said yeah and that's what most people do say that's what your flesh will tell you if you listen to it love your uh neighbor and hate your enemies that's what your that's what your own flesh will tell you if you'll listen to it amen but we're not to listen to that we're listening to the spirit that's inside amen that says that we should love our enemies that we should bless them that curse us we should do the good to them that hate us and pray for them which despitefully use and persecute us that's what the spirit says now is that easy no goes against everything your flesh wants to do to fight back to revile back to give anger for anger to give uh uh turmoil for turmoil to give hurt for hurt that's what that's what a person wants that's what your flesh wants to do I'm going to get even that's not what the spirit says that ye may be the children that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and he sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have you well everybody does does that the most Ardent atheist does that agnostic the worst criminal maybe ever of course I don't know maybe there's been some that didn't love anybody but the hardest person loves those that love them so what kind of reward is that then there's no reward to that but if you give to those you don't have to give back if you give to those not expecting to get back there's a there putting up Treasures in Heaven am rest restoring Treasures in Heaven amen and I'll say I believe with all my heart that what my grandson has waiting for him on the other side I believe this my whole family but is way far beyond a baseball amen sure is praise the Lord for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more more than others do not even the publicans sow be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect praise the Lord let me read you this Revelation 5 number one he says 1961 few days ago was sitting talking to my loyal friend here in the city of medical doctor Sadir he said how you doing bill I've been by his old office you ever been to Jeffersonville went by brother I call him brother samad's office Dr adair's office I went by his old office one time of course he passed away but how you doing bill I said pretty fair I suppose doc I said yourself he said oh uh got a lot of patience said I had 15 examinations this afternoon I said well that's good as long as it's just examinations and finding nothing wrong I said you know we got to talking back and forth because uh like back when we were boys I said well doc I don't know just how long I'm going to be around we're both in our 50s and he said that's true Bill I said but all these years about 31 years of ministry now I have kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes so he said that is true I said the greatest thrill I have is living for others am the greatest thrill I have is living for others so many people are so unhappy today and most of those people are some of the most selfish people you'll ever find yeah happiness is in giving happiness is in helping happiness is being in there being there for others he said the greatest thrill I've had is living for others amen don't rely on somebody else for your own happiness get it it's yours amen and he said that that's what life that's what the doctor now say Dr said that's what life is makes life real is when you not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others see that's when you're really living amen that's when you're really living and if there happens to be someone Among Us who has never done that tried to live for somebody else give it a try just see how much more life holds for you when you when you uh will not live for what you can give for yourself or out of life but what you can give someone else in life amen amen that is such a fantastic truth isn't it amen praise the Lord I got one more scripture I want to read in Acts Acts chapter 20 acts chap 20:35 we could have read the story amen you can find the story this comes from uh well I call it a story probably shouldn't call it a story I guess but the the reading that you'll find that uh accompanies this that this comes from is in Luke 14:12 when he talks about don't take the higher seat humble yourself and there may be somebody come in and uh do something for somebody that that you don't expect to get back and return but he says it this way I have uh uh acts 2035 I have showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus Remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive any of us that have practiced that you know that to be the truth amen amen you know that to be the truth it is more blessed to give than receive we trust God in what he says in his word amen to give is unto the Lord is not to respect anything in return but God's blessings on you it may be something as simple as storing up Treasures in Heaven amen which is where we all plan to go to be and trust that when we get there the Lord Lord's going to supply and bless let me read this one more this great example we we read the scripture last week brotherly kindness Peter came up to the man begging arms he said Silver and Gold Have I enough but what what I do have I'm going to give it to you amen amen rise up and walk praise the Lord the man rose up and walk and he was ecstatic because the Bible says he ran into the church jumping leaping and praising God you imagine how happy he was that after all those years he now could stand on his feet and walk that he could run that he could jump that he could work amen but you imagine how happy Peter was when he saw the man running and leaping and worshiping God and going into church with him you imagine how happy he was praise the Lord look now I said that to say this quote love 1956 I looked at his feet brother brandham had a prayer line man coming people coming through he had a man come through to him he said and a man was standing there and he said I looked at his feet and the man didn't have on any shoes I thought he maybe he never even had a pair of shoes all of a sudden something began to move me and I put my foot up beside his to see if my shoes would fit him I thought if my shoes will fit him I'll take them off now and give them to him amen amen he maybe never had a pair of shoes I thought here he is I pulled him up close to see uh to see uh if my shoulders and his if if he was whiter I'd give him my cooth Amen brother B said something moved on him to have love compassion he said I'd give me shoes if they would fit in I give him my coat of course you know brother Brown was kind of small in Statue so uh very good chance it didn't fit but he said I'd give him my shoes right here I take them off my feet amen I had one brother one time um up in the White Mountains actually I think it was Flag Staff anyway uh we come out from service and I comp minuted yet a nice I mean he had a i the guy had money but that didn't matter whether you got it or not shouldn't matter right but he had a nice cashmere fulllength coat on I mean that baby was warm so when you're in Flag Staff that's kind of important and I I confident said wow that looks really warm took it off and gave it to me it cashmere probably $3,000 dakot I don't know how much it cost like said he have money but he went the rest of that day as we were at church outside I I guess he was cold he got I didn't want to take it uh he almost basically shamed me into taking it you uh you know don't uh don't deprive me of this blessing I'm trying to give to you well what do you say to that and I had ministered that day I was hot sweaty labor is worthy of his heart yeah you know I put the coat on I was warm but it was a beautiful coat nice coat uh but but he did that for me I thought that's that's just wonder I had a brother one time I complimented his tight when we were over at uh we were over on cortera I compliment his T took it off his neck and gave it to me don't know if it meant anything to him or whatever doesn't matter he just gave it to me I still got it I wear it sometimes but it's just the just the matter of giving yeah it's not what it is it's just a matter of giving and I meant it you know it wasn't like oh that's a nice TI just to make conversation I meant I like this I like time but he took it off and gave it to me amen this that's we live our lives for others to help other people I'd give my coat to him I loved him something another I loved him I thought look here there's a poor old fell maybe never seen uh sit down to a good decent meal in life Maybe maybe he never wore a pair of shoes rusty old scaling looking feet toenails all turned up I thought poor old fella uh he has got just as much right to a good pair of shoes as I've got just as much right to wear a good coat as I as as I've got that's right amen just as much right to sit down to a good meal as I've got praise the Lord and that's the truth am living for others yes makes a it makes a difference in your life yes it's happiness it's fulfillment makes you feel good if you've ever done it which I'm sure pretty much everybody in here has it makes you feel good when you give to other people makes you feel good you think well what will I ever do how how will I ever survive without this God will make a way for you yes you believe in you trust him you trust God will take care of you has he always taken care of you w he always take care of you how can we think that he's going to not start not taking care of us now amen especially if you're giving as unto the Lord to help somebody without or to help somebody or just to make somebody's day better I mean we don't know I'll go back to this I'm closing here I'll go back to this the girl the little girl that Joel gave that baseball too her daddy or grandpa or whoever she would could have gone may have gone to Walmart and buy a hundred of them he might have plenty of money to buy 100 baseballs you could got that's not the point amen that's not the point the point isn't whether they can afford it or not the point isn't whether they're rich or not the point the point is that having a heart to help somebody having a heart to give having a heart to live for other people amen and not expecting anything in return praise the Lord that's where we should live s Amen brother brand said that's eternal life that's eternal life living your life for someone else is eternal life staring heaven in the face Jesus did it how about us amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could because I've admitted it made a difference in my life praise the Lord made a big difference in my life just seeing that being manifested and on display made a big difference in my life but let it be from your heart let it be from your heart who who you are Amen to want to try to help somebody try to help make somebody stay a little bit better amen praise the Lord Jesus amen
