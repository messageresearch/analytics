the only one to feel that way praise the lord i believe we all feel that way tonight amen amen we'll go to the lord in prayer now take any prayer requests i have a couple i want to mention before we open the floor tonight as i said brother john duncan is supposed to come back tomorrow he's supposed to be leaving his home in las vegas his family i should say in las vegas he'll be leaving in the morning so let's just pray the lord bless brother john give him the good travel back home bring us home safe amen so remember brother john in prayer also found out today this morning that uh brother jim swanson uh has contracted covet i don't know if anybody knows brother swanson the last time we had harmony i've known brother swanson from back in north carolina and different places he's a minister has a little church in sierra vista uh but uh he's got a tremendous uh voice and i think last obviously wouldn't have harmony last year but the last harmony he sang um i forgot i told you he said oh what a savior he sees that and it just he really belts it song anyway brother swanson has contracted covet his daughter has contracted covet his son-in-law has contracted covet and his son-in-law i believe is supposed to be was supposed to be put on a ventilator today brother jim was supposed to be sedated or something the information i'm getting is by all medical standards and human standards uh bleak but we know one better than all human medical standards amen so uh so let's remember brother jim i know his daughter's faith i'm not sure of his son-in-law's name let's remember brother jim swanson in prayer if we could tonight and his family also got a couple prayer requests from sister normal one for her son richard who will be leaving tomorrow to go to mexico he races in the baja races so he's leaving tomorrow to go down there and he'll be coming back after the races whenever that is i don't know if it'll be saturday sunday or what but she asked for traveling mercy's for him she also told me this afternoon informed me that her son-in-law daniel who made the pulpit for us um is has also contracted covet so let's please pray for him too uh brother daniel's been a precious brother he's come to a service or two here with us and uh and he voluntarily and wouldn't take any money for making this pull fit for us and uh i really appreciate it it's been a blessing so let's remember him in prayer if we could also uh we also want to remember uh the green family brother as i sent out to you brother dave green passed away yesterday i believe it was yesterday uh so sister chris his wife and of course chrissy and joy and angela need prayer and the family so let's please remember them in prayer brother god i always felt like brother david was a hezekiah god gave him a second lease on life he was he was dead over at northwest hospital for 20 minutes uh back 10 12 years ago whenever it was been a while back the lord blessed him with another uh 10 plus whatever years it was i guess i lose track but the lord really touched him brought him back in his sound mind and healthy heart and but you know it just comes that time and the lord took him yesterday so it just keeps happening saints it's like we said a few weeks back a couple months back uh it just it there's just something going on in the spirit world there's something happening i have my own opinions and thoughts about it obviously but uh there's something significant going on with all of these saints going on and it's not all copen uh you know brother roger's dad just passed away he didn't have coven steve just passed away he did dave just passed away he didn't um brother swanson's not doing well and and there's been others that have gone on that uh some with i'm not but it just it's just it just keeps it's just on and on uh but my brother angel jr of course so let's just remember the green family and those families extended family in prayer if we would brother dave was a was a fine brother i really would appreciate the opportunity if i could to go to his funeral to his memorial service he was very good to me when we first moved to tucson through brother john and joy yarborough brother he was always a blessing to me always encouragement always helpful one time i'll give this little testimony one time he uh we were somewhere i forgot where we were um but then this was back in no 203 something like that i forgot where being dave were somewhere with other people and he said you want to go get a steak and i said man i never turned out a steak and so we drove over and we went to little abner's on silver bell and he ordered two the porterhouse two of the most expensive steaks steaks and i said wow that's more and i was bit off more like a chew pun intended but um we got about a third of the way half the way done with our meal and he said uh or maybe it was when he was paying i can't remember he's and he put out a hundred dollar bill he said that's my last hundred dollars you have any more money bro uh he said literally this is my last hundred dollars he was just that kind of man he was the kind of man that would spend his last dollar because he knew and believed in the promise of god he gave and when you gave you can't out give god amen amen we all know that we've experienced it you can't outgive god he gave his last hundred bucks and of course uh well long after that we moved the mountains but god blessed him after that he became a multi-millionaire after that again amen i'm not saying it's as a result of him buying me a state but uh god said to return it a hundredfold so how who are you argue with that that's right amen but that's just kind of man he was i knew he gave a house to somebody one time he just was acting when he and when he became wealthy he bought people cars and uh he just he just was that kind of person but he didn't just give when he was rich he gave when he had nothing i like i said he gave his last hundred dollars to buy me a meal and i appreciated it then and uh i believe he was an example to me to a lot of people um of the promises that god gives amen so pray for the family uh another giant has gone home another saint has gone home to be with the lord so uh anyone else have a prayer request tonight on your heart yes dear my sister lady just sent me a text and she said that her mother-in-law is not doing well and her sister-in-law is making arrangements for hospice so just pray for the family so that would be you ralph's ralph's mom okay and his sister has down syndrome so they're gonna have

lord jesus we come to you this evening father amid his service thankful for the opportunity that we can have in the midweek service lord jesus and we come together to just get through the week and thank you praise your name once again thank you jesus and lord we have several needs to bring before you lord i remember them all but too many to bring forth but you know each and every one all these yes the passings of family members friends lord jesus may just come for each and every person involved yes jesus we know that there's a reason they are here on earth and there's a reason that you took them father and we thank you for everything that you've given us through this lord we ask that you be with those family members father god maybe with each and every one each and every person in our congregation those who couldn't be here for whatever reason jesus can you be with them anyone's sick and body lord jesus lord god if their spirits are low lord may you visit them tonight and help them and help them to get through the week so we can make it to the next point of time so we commit the remaining part of this service into your hands and rebuke satan in anything that you try to do to come against us we ask it and claim everything in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord thank you jesus you can be seated if you'd like amen anyone have a a song or a testimony on your heart now tonight will we change the order of the service sister matisse i was just so tired i've been just really run down trying to do all this research for building this heater and i i think i have something and then i run across a dead end and i've just really been keeping some hellacious hours and i and i came home today i got up around i don't know 9 30 10 30 i think yeah about 10 30 and i just so run down i came home and i sat down to have a little meal and about 1 30 finished eating and i passed out for two hours until 4 30 and i've been dehydrated and i just felt i just was almost catatonic sitting on the couch man i don't want to go to church but i know god's going to be here and that was just ringing in my heart god's going to be here and and and the other thing is that um when you're you're going to be here how can i show how could i stay home if you're coming and you're facing the same thing i am and and then we don't show up really really and so um you know and i and i just know that you know that god is gonna reward amen you know king david said i shall not offer sacrifices that cost me nothing he is such a great a great god that he he rewards us you know so yes i just i want to say how much i was revived while worshiping the lord tonight praise the lord what a reward this is amen yes it is and yeah it's been a it's been a rough couple days for me for the roger a couple tough jobs well same job but pulling 100 foot of wire through an inch and a quarter pipe and it it'll work on you but thank the lord god blessed it got it through everything worked wonderful got home time takes shower to come so thank the lord i just trust him for strength that's all i know i'm just glad it's not 110. amen so god bless your faithfulness sister matisse anybody else i forgot about sister patricia she's this whole world is just getting more and more discouraging you know um for me for her too but you know you know maybe you don't realize it but she gets so upset trying to work things out and yeah and said it was messing with her digestive system and you know i mean she's up and she's out and around but she's all trying to fix problems and things and understand yeah amen i know that brother i it i don't even harden i don't even hardly recognize um this earth this country anymore and you're 20 years older than i am so i can't only imagine oh it's different yeah anybody else in yeah it's the same song saying sunday um looks like repeating songs is the theme for tonight there's a reason um i know joel was singing along with me someday so he can sing his little heart out too but if anyone else wants to sing along yeah feel free [Music] when david gathered a handful of stones where the soldiers had fallen he waited along with a prayer and a little rock the giant fell right on the spot yes well that's what david prayed for and that's what david got no you can't ask too much of my god amen [Music] she had so many regrets so often she fell while jesus knew where she had been so he forgave her of her sins and her life began to flow living waterfalls no you can't ask too much of my yacht when you're broken and you cannot find a peace of mind that seems to leave you behind have you spoken [Music] [Music] and you can't ask too much of my heart no you can't ask too much of my god amen yes upon the three hebrew children god smiled and when sarah was 19 god gave her a child now i believe the justice [Music] he only needs to hear from you oh you can't ask too much of my [Music] and you cannot find a piece of mind that seems to leave you behind have you spoken yes to the god of abraham the great and [Music] [Music] and you is find a piece of mind that seems to leave you behind have you spoken to the god of abraham the great no you can't ask too much of your heart no you can't ask too much of my god no you can't ask too much of my god [Music] no you can't ask [Music] amen yes thank you jesus amen [Applause] so true and can't ask too much i think it's an outstanding amen that uh mike is saying that i can i can vouch for the fact that that was dave green that was one of dave green's favorite scripture favorite songs and his girls i know they sang it so many times i remember especially after the incident where he died in the hospital and the lord blessed him and touched him can't ask too much of god as one of two songs i remember dave green singing the most yes praise the lord wonderful anybody else yeah dominic's father just passed away and i've been chewing on something that he said he said well he said grandma when there was a family relative that died they um a friend of grandmas said you know god just told me he died prematurely and she said let's let's uh god wants me to listen wants him to live again and so they went out and they got a shovel and they dug him up and he lived another um he at the time of the telling uh i don't know how many years ago this was he was still an active member in the church so you know it got me to thinking about and they were a very very feverish pentecostal group and right here in tucson and i've got to it got me to thinking about how many of us have cast on prematurely that weren't quite ready to go because we know satan's going about as a roaring lion right now i have not asked god to remind anybody and i because i thought you know they're in a better place right but we don't you know that's kind of a judgmental i don't i don't know that and and um and and maybe they were it was premature for some of these people and so um i'm going to start asking god to start reviving these people if it's not their time yet well the key phrase you put there was the lord spoke to her and said that was it i'm not going to a graveyard and try to talk to people yeah yeah but i believe if the lord spoke to someone and said thus and thus then it was a death brother it's like brother branham said if god told him to go raise george washington he'd invite the whole world to come see and he would go right out to george washington's grave and he would he would be raised from the dead amen praise the lord but in the hospitals it's easier you know probably yeah but we're trusting the lord in all things so thankful for that let's stand if we could tonight first kings turn our bibles to first kings chapter 17. as we normally do on our wednesday night we don't take too much time by leaving the lord and just a simple thought tonight that went along with the songs with testimonies with so many things that were done and said here so we're just trusting the lord that uh it's his perfect will amen first kings chapter 17. we'll read the first three verses but before we do can we just bow our heads for another word of prayer lord jesus we're indeed grateful again lord for feeling your presence and knowing you here real the same yesterday today and forever we thank you lord for this word that we've opened the pages loved lord tonight and understand and recognize that this word was given to us lord for inspiration for revelation for you lord to speak to us through and we thank you for it lord it helps us understand who you are god and and the way you do things and the things that you're pleased with lord and and all those things are important to us in living our lives for what we could do to be pleasing to you so we pray god that this uh this time of fellowship we have now lord and as we change all of this service that you would speak to us from this word lord that eternal thought and process that you had preordained before the foundation of the world for us tonight for this little group for those who may be streaming or watch it later we just pray god that you would minister to our hearts to our needs to our lives speak through these lips ear hear through our ears lord as we give you the praise and glory for all the testimonies lord believing that you're already working and moving on the prayer requests because you already know what we have need of lord and god we do believe that you can do anything we committed to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen first kings 17 1 elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee hints and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the broke cherith that is before jordan you could be seated if you'd like amen i just want to take a little simple thought if the lord willing tonight on he will provide yes amen he will provide so now may he be listening to and hearing that the uh the title of the thought that was on my heart that uh would help make a little more sense of a lot of the testimonies and the things that's been sung and said here tonight amen and the encouragement that we have you know uh when you listen to a lot of times messages brother branham the tapes you put on and you know when brother branham is at a place where he's going to have a prayer line afterwards he usually takes a subject a scripture and an attitude towards building the faith of the people getting the people into a place of receiving by faith receiving that healing or receiving that that they've come up for prayer for and that whole the whole 30 45 minute hour or whatever just build up to that is for that purpose to bring it to that now of course the scripture is spoken the scripture is preached in the scripture and the hearing of the word brings faith but that whole motive of that brother ram says that many times is to bring it to that place and it kind of reminded me of that tonight and the songs and the things that was said and done to bring it to that place of night to this to this climax of the uh of the title is he will provide he will provide now that statement stands alone of its of its own he will provide there's not a might there's not a could be there's not a possibly there's not a he can't no he will provide i'm not here to tell you he can provide we know he can provide i'm here to tell you tonight he will provide amen has he ever met a time that he hasn't provided for us i i would stand here and say tonight to me in my personal testimony there has never been a time where god hasn't provided for us now it isn't always when we wanted it to be it wasn't always how he wanted it to be but god has always provided and he always will because that's the promise of his word even when elijah was standing here and declaring the curse that was upon israel when he was telling uh ahab that there won't be any rain or no dewfall till i call for it according to my word there'll be none even in the midst of that curse elijah was a part of that land elijah was in the midst of that curse the curse that he by god proclaimed upon the land he was in the midst of it now he but the big part of it he wasn't a part of the curse he was in the midst of the curse but he wasn't a part of the curse the curse didn't include him because god provided for elijah that's the next part of this he says go to the broke chair then i will feed you there god provided for elijah but god provided for elijah after the curse because you notice here the first verse is when elijah pronounced the curse there won't be any rain and no do till according to my word so that was a was a statement settled and finished before he come out from ahab now god says now the word of the lord come unto him and said now do this so my point is when when elijah uh pronounced that curse and him being in the midst of that curse uh he didn't know what god was gonna do for him it didn't say god doesn't tell him to go to the brook cherith until after he pronounced the curse you understand but i believe of course this prophet elijah had enough and knew enough of god to knew that if god told him to do something god was going to provide for him god was going to take care of him and how many times even in our ignorance even in you know this may sound a little crude but even in our stupidity sometimes god still provides yes so it still takes care of us how did you get yourself down in that ditch i don't know lord i made a wrong turn somewhere i'll provide for you just come on amen i'll take care of you just come on you're down there again i know lord i made the wrong turn again we get ourselves in trouble make stupid decisions do wrong things and god says i'm dead i'm there i'll provide for you i'll still take care of you you're belong to me you're my child i'm going to take care of you and that's what god does he provides for his own even though elijah was in the midst of the curse he wasn't a part of the curse god gave him a word now that was afterwards but god told him now now you go to the brook chair i'll take care of you there and of course god sent the ravens bringing bringing him meat in the morning and bringing him meat in the afternoon and he drank by the drank the water from the broke god provided for him and we know as we've studied before the word cherith here means cutting amen god was doing a little surgery on spiritual surgery on elijah cutting on elijah a little bit because elijah was about to come to one of the greatest showdowns in scriptural history not just for his life but one of the greatest showdowns in scriptural history was about to take place elijah facing off with all of ahab's prophets on mount carmel the mount carmel showdown so god had to tune if you will elijah up a little bit god had to cut him a little bit god had to take away some certain things and get elijah in the place that he was going to be in the position of faith to be able to do what he needed to do on mount carmel now a lot of times people come and they they face these uh they they face these adversities head on and they fall flat on their faces because they have nothing to sustain them there well first of all probably wasn't a directive of the lord because if you felt fight on your face it surely wasn't a directive of the lord because god would take care of that person but how many times head on and but they have no authority to do so they have no they got inspiration they got enthusiasm they got emotion but then they fall flat on their face because it wasn't of god it wasn't the will of the lord look at david and brother and i'm doing trying to do a god of service without his will fell flat on his face a man of god a man after god's own heart fell flat on his face bro brought curses upon the people because of his decision and fell flat because it wasn't of the lord but now god had to get elijah ready god had to prepare elijah so this this curse had to come that was also a judgment on israel but it was also something to help elijah tune himself up and get himself ready for the faith that he needed to to be able to attack them on this showdown on mount carmel had to be some cutting take place some people worry that god won't provide now this worry is many times secretive people won't normally tell you that they might in a roundabout way but their fear overcomes their faith and they and they and they don't have anything to hold on to at that point so they don't so they worry that god won't provide but if you understand the scripture and have the faith to believe what jesus has done always done always will do in the promise of his word you know he's going to provide as he did then he'll do now if god done it one way one time he'll do it that way all the way through and we can't doubt that god will provide always has some people worry about it but you you can't worry i mean you can't let you can't let doubt and fear enter in because god will take care of his own amen now we notice that elijah after he left the cherith and the brook dried up god sent him down to zaraphat and zarephath uh means in the hebrew means refinery so first of all just like god does to us so many times amen we get us in the position we need to be in god has to cut on us a little bit get certain things away and tune certain things up and make certain things right or build that faith to a place and then there's got to be a refinery that takes place it's kind of kind of like the potter in the clay amen where the clay he's the potter sometimes he takes that clay and it's just a big ugly lump and that's exactly what i was a big ugly woman but god put us on the refining wheel and he began to cut here and he began to take tools and cut this off and cut that off and shape it here and shape it there but then there come a time where it started to get into a certain image when he got into that image of what he had in his mind sort of like michelangelo and the and uh moses you know we had in his mind you know it was asked to michelangelo what well how are you able to chip moses out of this he said oh that was easy i just chipped everything all the stuff away that wasn't moses i say it sounds easy to you i don't know easy to me but uh easy to you but yeah he he said all i did was knock away everything that wasn't moses and see that's exactly what god does to us that's what god was trying to do with elijah was cutting and he had to come to a refining place god wants to cut everything away that's not him everything everything of our lives is not him god wants to cut that away but then when you get to that uh image when it starts to resemble what you want it to be let's just say a cup or something on the pottery wheel it gets to the place that it begins to resemble uh what what you want it to be what the what's in your mind then there's just little fine tunings that go on you put away the cutting tool you put away the the the uh the things that that take big gouges and you you start refining it you just put little fine tunes to it then to make it exactly the way you want it to be i used to do that woodworking when i was woodworking in high school i really loved that making stuff i could make something like this you know a heartbeat but then you get to the place where you cut all the wood and you put it all into place you look at it and you say well that looks pretty crude and rough but then you get to refining it and you smooth off the edges and you sand it down and then it just starts coming into a beautiful piece of furniture that's the way god wants it to be that's the way god had to do with elijah he had to refine him he had to get elijah to the place that uh that that god could use him for that position on mount carmel now so many times people also have in their minds the doubt comes in but people also a lot of times think well god's provision is is is miraculous well god's provision isn't always miraculous friend in fact most of the time if you look in the scripture the miracles that god does he does by the hands of other people amen now he god is a miracle worker uh he can make the sun come out right now if you wanted to right i mean he can do we know he can do uh miracles and make something out of nothing he's the only one that can do that of course that spoken word that god did in the beginning he's the same god today i know that but if you look at the scripture most of the time the miracles that take place were at the hands of other people think about it and so many times god is looking to provide for us but a lot of times the provision that god wants to make for us comes by the work of our hands it's like sister mati said the sacrifice i don't give what kind of sacrifice if it isn't if there's nothing that takes from me if it's simple if it's easy if there's no stretch if there's no hardship if there's no struggle or if there's no push or pull then what what's the sacrifice and that's the way the sacrifices became uh to israel they became just a common thing that meant nothing to them it's just you know take the take the lamb and go down and kill him and and do do the dating then go back home that's all it became to him and that's the way it is for a lot of people but what kind of sacrifice it is isn't something that is sacrificial that is sometimes hard sometimes it it takes you your very energy and effort that's a lot of times that's what god provides but he provides by the work of our hands that's that's the provision you got some people said well i don't want that well then you don't want to be provided for because god wants to provide for you but sometimes it comes a lot of times it comes by the sweat of the brow sometimes it comes by the strength of the hand the provision that god wants to make there's effort that's put into it there's there's sacrifices put into it to be able to to gain the provision that god's looking for now we're going in the story elijah doesn't only god doesn't only provide for elijah chairman a cherith and zeraphat he also as god sends him to this widow woman god also then provides for the widow amen she was obedient by the work of her hand god provided for her and her son god you say well uh that god let's go back to this god didn't put a cake on their table every day god didn't do that right all he did was make sure that the crews didn't run dry the mill didn't go dry right that's all god did it was her choice it was her hand and her work that caused the to get into the oil to get into the grain to do everything to make the case and to bake what was needed to sustain their lives she had to do her part and work toward through the provision that god had made yes it was a miracle that the loaves and the fishes yes it was a miracle that the crews didn't go dry and the barrel didn't go empty yeah it was a miracle but it took her hand god didn't just put the cake there god didn't say well exactly how would you like your t-bone now can god do that he said well god i prefer a rib eye well tough no i'd rather it be but you understand sometimes it takes most of the time it takes the work of our hand that god provides that god blesses because that's his word so many people so many times want it the simple way but most of the time friend it doesn't come the simple way right look at this now we know these stories but deuteronomy uh excuse me genesis let's go to genesis chapter 22. praise the lord so the fact that elijah was obedient and god provided for elijah also was able to sustain this widow woman and her son praise the lord see what so many times our decisions have repercussions good or bad they they reverberate out to the people around us maybe not even people that we know it's amazing that they talk today and there's this big debate now uh going on the supreme court about abortion well it should never have been a debate it should have always been declared abortions murder period if you do it we're gonna put you in jail that should be the end of that because it is but there's a big debate now this state's got a new law that should are they going to uphold the law are they going to throw it out is it against roe versus wade is the federal government going to dictate is the state government during the dictate people out there screaming and yelling my body my choice and all these things and i'm thinking yeah well you know people are doing the same about the about the coleman uh shot yeah i almost said vaccines not a vaccine the covet shock they're doing the same thing my body my choice and i agree with them to that point but then the others will come and say yeah but your choice is affecting other people and i'm saying yours doesn't yeah first of all you're murdering a child second of all who knows what that child is going to grow up to be right that child could have been the president of the united states one day that person could have been a minister of the gospel that person could have affected hundreds or thousands of lives millions of lives you don't know you say well it doesn't affect anybody else oh yes it does our lives affect other people every day i just debate with that same guy uh the job we were looking at and he's gone on and on and on and at the end of it or this ended it by the way anyway we were talking about uh abortion and he said well you know israel has abortion i said i don't care that's up to israel i said it's still wrong i don't care who does it or don't do it it's still wrong and and he went on i said well i'll just tell you this i said i sure am glad my mama didn't decide to have an abortion that ended it he was he was done talking at that point but it's the truth yeah see and how many people are affected not only by the actual literal act but the residual effects of ending and terminating that life of what it could have been to the world people all over the world they say oh it doesn't affect anybody else yes it does oh yes it does our and our lives affect other people's lives every day every day now genesis chapter 22 let's look at uh beginning with verse five this question abraham was taking isaac up to be sacrificed to offer up and abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass as i and the lad will go yonder worship and come again to you now that's a statement of faith that in itself right because god had already told him take your son your only son up there and sacrifice him so for and that's all he knew just like elijah all elijah knew was go tell him no rain or do and that's exactly what it is i mean there's could there been a private conversation with god elijah sure there could have been it's not written in the scripture elijah could have said well god what about me you know a lot of times that's the way we get don't we oh i'm so selfish sometimes self-centered that's the way of the world today right yeah selfish self-centered me number one no not just number one me only really people like it that way they'd rather just be the only ones but i don't know i just said what about me lord a lot of people what about me lord but i i you know i'm gonna say that didn't take place i don't know but it's not in the scripture that's our that's our absolute so it's not in the scripture elijah said went and told ahab exactly what even though he was a part of it well abraham did the same thing he knew that god told him to go take isaac and sacrifice him that was all he knew that was what god had told him this is what you need to do this is where you need to do it so when abraham told his uh the young lads there that they would go worship and come back that was a statement of faith yes amen abraham took the wood of the burnt offering laid it upon his uh upon isaac his son just like god did to his sons and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they were uh they went both of them together and isaac speaking to abraham's father said my father he said here i am my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb praise the lord right for a burnt offering so they went both of them together god will provide yes amen and they came to the place which god had told them of and abraham built an altar there laid the wooded order bound isaac his son and laid him upon laid him on the altar upon the wood abraham stretched forth his hand took his night to slay his sons because that's what god asked him to do amen abraham was faithful to the point of death you know sometimes god provision isn't always when we want it to be a lot of times or all the time god's provision is going to be when he wants it and how he wants it yeah what we need to do is to get into his spirit so that we understand through his spirit what that and when that is going to be sometimes god waits till the last minute yes he does oh god uh we we don't have any food fill up our cabinets with food god doesn't normally work that way great but he'll give you what you need when you need it we've heard the story who was it that repeated it here not long ago about the man that sat there had the orphanage or something set there they had no food they said let's just get around like we're getting ready to eat set the table get everything ready just like we normally do we have food to eat everybody sit down and we pray and we ask god and thank god for the food yes and get halfway down with the prayer and the knock comes to the door so we had all this food our truck broke down or something whatever it was truck broke down we got all this food uh we we need uh we need somebody to eat consume we need to get rid of top table full of kids now they got food yes from a truck god pre-ordained to bring them food yes maybe at the last second right but god still does it may not be in the way that we expect it to be but god will still do it amen because he does it when and how he wants to do it it's his choice sometimes it's a sometimes it's a step at a time sometimes what we need and what we're looking for in provision is is uh is taken a step at a time just like healing healing most of the time is a step at a time it's a process problem said it's a process of time that all the time we want a miracle any people they all want a miracle we're sick god heal me this very second and then that hinders our faith from actually receiving healing amen because we expect instantaneous deliverance from this but sometimes it's a step at a time right you know brother ram talked about that story that man he was talking about god and you believe in god his infidel and and brother branham was telling them so well where's jehoma it's over the hill he said how do you get there there was this path that run over here he said hey you know there's a path he said well i've been there before he said well you can't see it now he said well i got this ladder he said yeah but the latter will only show you one step at a time one step at a time amen one day at a time sweet jesus sometimes it's only a step at a time we want it now god we want it instantaneously we want a miracle and sometimes it's just a step at a time it's it's a progress it's a it's a progression and we just we just expect god to do well just like elijah elijah's was a step at a time he went to the and obey god first step was no reign or do second step was go to the brook chair third step was go to the uh uh the next uh forgot the name of it now the next one that he went to and then the widow woman it was all a step at a time amen it's all a step at a time well god uh we've exhausted that what's next well when it comes time god will show you god will provide it god will make a way yes it's coming in the most i don't know how i'm gonna pay the bills god will provide amen yes he will provide it's his it's his uh uh responsibility to provide god this this is god's house he'll provide for it right amen he'll take care of it he always does now again most his provision that he gives i haven't i haven't found a twelve hundred dollar tree yet to go plug the money off of to pay the rent for the building it comes by the work of our hands right amen the church the giving and uh it all comes with the work of our hands yet he provides but he provides through us amen praise the lord so god's providing for abraham as abraham tells his son god will provide us a sacrifice he's got his hand up to take his own son's life just like god said eleventh first the angel of the lord called out un unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham he said here am i he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing that thou has not withheld thy son thy only son for me abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him in a behind him a ram caught in a thicket by the horns abraham went went and took the ramp offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jirei it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen jehovah jireh god shall provide himself amen god will provide no if ands but think about the think about the children of israel how many times did god provide and miracles miraculous things over and over and over and over again for them yes god made a way in every situation every time even in the midst of their burmering and they're complaining even when they got themselves in the deepest ditches even when they made uh so many horrible fatal errors god still took care of them so much so look at deuteronomy we're going to close here in just a minute deuteronomy uh i was going to read more than this verse 5. deuteronomy 29 5 and i have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxing old upon you and thy shoe is not waxing old upon my foot right 40 years and they weren't 40 years sitting in an easy chair with their feet up right these were 40 hard years of sojourning and walking and travailing around that desert for 40 years right but their clothes didn't get old and their shoes didn't fall off their feet right anybody anybody in here got anything you had 40 years ago nobody i might but don't fit anymore i don't think i have anything that 40 years that was before me and my wife got married 40 years ago i don't have anything 40 years ago that i even own anymore much less it would fit me but not one thing their clothes shoes god provided for them and everything they did and all the murmuring and all the complaining even the miracles the provision god did god they were screaming and yelling about food god gave them fresh manna every single day miraculously they just had to go out and get it right amen then he told him well now on the sixth day take enough for yourself for the seventh day because you're not going to gather on that day it's a day of rest and some people still try to do it you know what happened to them and of course even if they got for even if they went out on the seventh day it brought it anyway it was no good so it didn't help you obey the lord but god provided for them then they're like well we're sick of this light bread god sends them quails they go get the quails grab them up we got food we got me and they got tired of that just one thing after the other amen but god continued to to provide for them left and right always god still does the same thing for us today amen god provides for us every way every time god provides let's go to one more scripture philippians chapter 4. amen philippians chapter 4 amen verse 19. philippians 4 19 but my god shall supply all all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus he god will provide supply not some not most all your needs all my needs right if i was a good televangelist i'd tell you to say it to yourself now but you know that you know who you are i don't need to tell you to say it but he will supply all my needs now how is he going to do this he's going to do it with his provisions right with his riches in glory oh my well now you've tapped an inexhaustible supply of riches an inexhaustible supply of of provisions god-giving now we've tapped into something that's eternal so our needs are not just supplied say people will look for the next check or people look for the name the government this and and the the job that and and all all the things swirling all around us look at this and you know god supplies it now the tapping in i know the federal government especially nowadays seems to believe that they have an exhaustible supply of print they can print money left and right and everything's going crazy expensive now but they think they can just go and just print money but if you do that in your garage they'll put you in jail but they can do it it's okay for them to do it trillions of dollars trillions i can't even fathom what is a trillion how many zeros is in a trillion just one people say they're gonna they're gonna tax the billionaires you could take every money from all the billionaires in the world and it won't touch half of our bud of our deficit yeah that's a lot so now you think but god's inexhaustible riches come from glory come from him owns the cattle one thousand uh a thousand heels he's the same god today he supplies our needs he provides our need we the worry fret concern sometimes we get concerned concerned not i get that worry worry will put you in a heart attack yes worry will put you in a physical state that you don't want yourself to be in but we can believe and have faith that god's going to provide i know sometimes that i've i've in my own mind and and come across things situations circumstances that it looked bleak things didn't look like they were going to work out very well and then you go to talk to the lord about it and god will remind you didn't i do this didn't i do this weren't you in this kind of situation here over here and i did this and i took care of this over here and i provided for that there i took care of you over here and then as you start enveloping yourself in the presence of the lord and remembering the things that god had done for you it just takes away all the worry yeah amen it takes away all the stress it takes away all the bitterness takes away all all those things that that work to destroy the spirit and the connection of god but unfortunately a lot of times that's the last place people go is to god and say god ask him amen you send god today he will provide he never see the righteous forsaken or receive begging bread right because he provides yes amen many times we we work hard for those provisions sometimes in our lives and our bodies and the strength that we give but it's god's provision it doesn't make it any less god's provision it's like the scripture said oh i i gained i gained this wealth of myself no you didn't if you did if there wasn't a god to give you your next breath you couldn't do anything right amen if there wasn't a god to take to put the next beat in your heart you would be a dead man if you didn't have the strength in your back or the intelligence in your mind you're worthless you're done you can't provide anything but god provides amen god provides god takes care of the ability for us to be able to do what we need to do to his honor and glory right amen it's all for his honor and glory amen let's stand if we could praise the lord god our provider always provides he will continue to provide and he is no respecter of person and like micah said we can't ask too much of him it's impossible to ask too much of it it's his riches and glory he's supplying it with is that inexhaustible amen praise the lord listening this little course tonight jehovah he is the provider he makes a way where there seems to be no way we believe it faith trust and he's going to continue to do so amen oh i made such a big mistake god's going to no no no no he's not just come back to him repent forgiveness god watches after his own amen blessing us to him jehovah [Music] my problem you are more than enough for me [Music] [Music] by your strides set free you are with me [Music] you are more
