brother Danny uh was up his neighbors kept him up all night uh so he was very groly weary tired so pleas remember him in prayer fortunately though the good part about it is it sounds like by his admission that this is the neighbors uh that live above him that's get getting evicted so thankful for that apparently they kept banging stuff all night long or dropping stuff and H the floor whatever kept keeping him awake waking him up am then so uh please remember him if you would we U um I got woke up at midnight our new neighbors downstairs can be kind of loud too especially the man I don't know if he gets drunk and just starts yelling and panging things and cussing and carrying on so we'll be having a discussion with our another discussion I already told her once about it U but it hadn't happened last couple times was with Sonia home I was home last night uh so uh appreciate you about that art is home so very than thank for that pray they got some things personal other things that they're I'm sure taking care of today they have going on so thankful that the Lord touched him and just trust in God continue to mend and mold and bring that back the way it should be in the Lord just want to serve the Lord Jesus amen but the thing is when you it sounds simple but it's not something the devil's just going to let you do uh he's going to fight you every single step of the way that he can yes amen got a text from Sister Lydia as well she's doing much better not quite up being able to come today uh but please remember her in prayer I'm sure maybe you all knew the the last week she went to the doctor that we mentioned last Sunday uh stitches out tubes out everything's good everything's progressing great she's doing fine uh she has some upcoming tests that we're going to believe that uh that the Lord's hand is upon they're going to be negative so please remember her in prayer but she's so so much wanting of course to be with us so please remember her in prayer if you would as well amen haven't contacted or heard Sister Sister Julie P but the Lord knows so just please remember everyone we're just one body amen praise the Lord so have an unspoken request on your yeah yeah two weeks from today I'll be in Greece um for a pretty exensive vacation so your prayers you travel Merc um it's kind of an odd part of the request I have is I'll be going to Corinth which is where the Corinthians were and Ephesus wasians were and I would like while I'm there uh if the Lord could just show me where the biblical things occur I don't any of the tour information they have are going to contain that so I would really like to just kind of that voice inside of us that kind of directs us just speak to me so I can kind of maybe bring some of that back stories pictures leaving I'm leaving on the fourth yeah I'll leave get I keep forget I wasn't we got it got him for another Sunday or so before he goes on vacation uh so I just couldn't remember so please remember that prayer we'll be with us next Sunday so but just thankful want to do it come Joel got St by be the other day and had an infection come out um so he's taking some medicine for pray I'm sure it's been painful for him hard devil just keeps attacking little that a liar service over the Lord is mindful as long as God's hands on that's what matter the Lord so pleas let's stand to our feet if we could take these knees to the Lord Lord Jesus for all Lord Jesus I can recall that the prophet David said I was glad when he said unto me let us go house yes we know father as our ping mentioned already enemy is fighting this harder than he he has fought in this whole time of the existence oh yes and father you said when Satan comes in like a flood he'll raise a standard yes Lord and we know father greater he that's in us than he that's in the world you know that's your promise your promises will not fail us Lord and Lord we need to recognize that it took one word this place out of place when Satan was speaking to Eve that cause all this sin on the Earth but father it was your plan to come forth as a savior oh God thank you and Lord it takes one word to uh be misplaced or uh just not in the right place to keep us off away from you and away from your word away from serving you in the right way yes Lord I can recall it in the father ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth as jamus and jambers we stood Moses so are they a reate mind concerning the faith Jesus and Lord that's what fighting us harder than ever Lord that maybe someone to say you know I don't need to come to church I can listen to the tapes I can listen to the pastor online and we know father that if you can't make it this is your place of Duty yes Lord there some that are said father that's understandable but father it's time to recognize the day and the message and the hour that were to resist the devil that he'll flee from us to think that we can do something that we know that the word says different then that's iniquity and we know at the end you have some to come up to you can I do this for you Lord I go out the mission field then I pay more ties than than anyone then I um just uh become a a real Christian everywhere I went but you'll say to them depart from me you workers of for I never knew you Lord it has to be you control you know that same says God is my co-pilot that's wrong father father you are our pilot we're the co-pilot you a pilot has the plane under control yes Lord father copilot just listens and and obeys what the pilot wants him to do and that's how we need to even come before you in prayer we need to obey you father and just listen to what you want us to do you said in your word if two shall agree touching anything it shall come to pass amen yes if my words abide if I abide to you my words abide to you ask what you will and it'll be granted unto you amen yes Lord I will as you pray and believe give you the desires of your heart thank you Jesus and father there's different ones that are sick this morning my brother just having a restless night and he's had problems with his knees father may you touch him yes Lord and father sister lyia and that's recuperating from her surgery oh I know she wanted to be with us this morning but Lord give her speeding Jes amen and Lord um anyone else I can we call you're mindful of them you heard it and father may you come on the scene and Grant all the ones that are sick a healing touch from you amen we know you are a great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healen yes Lord and Lord help the ones that are going through it mentally oh as the prophet says the mind is the wound to the heart and that's how we first accept you but once that drops in our heart and Satan cannot take it out of us if we're truly born again and father may you touch the ones that are going through these mental problems for we know you can deliver them as you delivered Legion had many Devils people that are going through this they believe no matter what condition they in they can be delivered in the name of Jesus Christ yes Lord granted father bless our pastor as he labors Faithfully to bring forth your word may our hearts be open to receive it father we're here to hear from you we want to grow into the stature of the fullness perfection in Jesus Christ Lord in your name we pray name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you like amen thank the Lord for being so mindful of us amen

watched it one time in a theater with brother Ju morning and I purchased it and was going to watch it I watched it all up to the scoring part I had to turn it off couldn't watch it I've never touched it since I don't even know where it is now I just I can't watch it it's just my heart just exploded to to try to watch and but if it weren't for that then we'd everyone be lost he could have called 12

scripture this morning I want to go over to Romans chapter 14 amen Romans chapter 14 begin reading there amen Romans chapter 14 praise the Lord so thankful God is so good amen thank you Jesus amen ROM 14 start with the first verse and then before we do let's just word pray precious Lord Jesus God we are so very thankful father of that Mercy that Grace that love that Lord sh of brought Upon Our pathway and does every day Lord every second we have is because of your love because of your love that brought that Mercy it was your love that brought that Grace it was your your love that loved us so much Lord you were willing not just to forget to forgive but forget Lord us as humans we can remember things one another's down we remember things we did but Lord you put them in your seal forgivness and as awesome and as mighty and as all-encompassing as you are Lord you forget it oh Lord what could it what it means to us we thank you so much father we just give you all the praise and glory Lord just to worship you you mean so much to us thank you Lord for this time thank you for this service thank you for this place you've provided for us Lord thank you for those that have come those who may be streaming today Lord we just commit it all into your hands we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt H or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and praise for all that is said and done here today Lord may your Holy Spirit Come come sweep through this place as we felt so far Lord and do that exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think believing Lord this word to return void but accomplish in US accomplish in this place accomplish here today what you have predestined and pre and for ordained for it to for it to accomplish Lord we commit it to you Lord we're nothing without you let our will be molded into yours Lord Lord God and everything that we have have everything that we do everything that we want all of our desires our wants or needs Lord are all encapsulated in you Lord we just commit ourselves to you now fully truly holy in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord Romans chapter 14 we'll start with verse one Romans 141 him that has weakened the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth hers let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received him who art thou that judgest another man's servant to his own Master he standeth or fth Y he shall be Holden up for God is able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and He that regardeth not the day to the Lord he does not regard it he that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks for none of us live to ourselves and no man dieth to himself for for whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords amen man you can be seated if you like and that's what matters that we are his amen that we belong to the Lord it comes along especially it seems like quite a spirit in the message especially in the message I would say but even amongst Christianity and not to negate or to lessen any of the importance of following and living the scripture and and uh the the uh the Commandments of God that he's given us not to negate or to lessen any of those things but we do recognize that we belong to God that God made us the way he made us he made us in our own unusual way every one of us is different amen but we mesh together as one group and that's the way it's supposed to be see the Bible says here and that is is weak in the faith receive that person amen because they're still in the faith yes even though they may be weak in the faith they're still in the faith amen receive that person because they're still in the faith that's right and don't do it to doubtful disputations don't do it to the point you say okay well we receive him but we don't think he's going to last long oh we don't think he's got what it takes oh we don't think that that person's ever going to become anything we don't think that person's going to hang on very long that's doubtful disputation oh we receive him but we judge him to the place that we say well because he's not doing it exactly the way I think it should be done he's not going to make it or he's not part of God or he's not really a Christian Saints anything as long as it's according to the scripture we're all in different ways amen we all uh uh are different people God did not God did not determine before the foundation of the world to make every one of us cookie cutter Christians as I've said before many times God is Not determined to make us cookie cutter Christians he didn't just come out with a hole and have a stamp in every one of us he just stamped along an assembly line and that person just spit out another robot and there's another robot and there's he supposed to be exactly the same way supposed to be the same height look same buil same out that's not the way God's body's made up and it's not that way because every one of us are supposed to fulfill our own particular uh calling that God has given us in life we all have a calling if we belong to God we all have a calling we all have a purpose we all have a gift we all have something that God has for us to do when we're here on this Earth and if anybody tries to negate or downplay or put out any of those things they are wrong amen because there's not a gift in the spirit that's in the scripture not one gift that's in the scripture that calls for someone to be the one to lay the hammer down and say okay my gift is to determine that you're not going to make it that's not a gift in the Bible excuse me but it seems like that that's a gift that a lot of people seem to have and that's the sad part just because they might not be just like you or do this particular thing just like you or because as the Bible said or because you eat meat and I don't think you should do that or that you uh regard this certain day or whatever and I don't think you should do that well that's your choice amen but it's not against the word if it's not against the word why are you coming against me about it I'm not talking about anything sinful friends but things that everybody just do does a little differently amen and we're that way for a purpose we all come from different parts of this country I think everybody here was born in the United States except my wife and she's just barely crossed the border but everybody was born but we're all born in different places we're all had different upbringings we all had different things that we went through in life we all had different friends we all lived in different neighborhoods we've all had different educations we all had different jobs we've all come up through different parents maybe one parent in a home maybe both parents I don't know maybe broken home maybe not broken home I don't know but we've all come through different things but it's that way for Reason God Made it that way for a purpose I was telling uh Sonia this morning that uh about my upbringing and you know I had really good friends growing up and I love my friends and I didn't think I'd ever be when I was growing up I didn't think I'd ever be in life without my good buddies without my good friends we did things together we went places uh we were always outside digging in the mud or swimming in the pond or getting croads and salamanders out of the Creek or riding the bikes or or or playing a sport football baseball basketball always doing something always together going on Tri trips together and I thought these would be my buddies these would be my friends for the rest of my life and I was telling my wife I said now they weren't they weren't they didn't grow up to be the kind of person that I am they're not ministers I I don't know that any of them serve the Lord now uh they probably considered themselves Christians although being nominally Christian uh but they weren't would not have been very good influences but the Lord had it that way for a reason amen because he had to mold me in the way that he wanted me to do to fulfill a certain purpose in my life and every one of us God has done the same way to fulfill a certain purpose in life not everybody is supposed to stand up behind the pull pit and preach the gospel but every one of us are supposed to go out that door and preach the gospel with our lives to the rest of humanity amen amen not every one of us is supposed to have a gift of of tongues not every one of us is supposed to have a gift of Prophecy not every one of us supposed to have the gift of helps but God puts those in the body so that every one of us flourish so that we all come to the same place it's like I was saying about uh uh mentioning even about the BIOS we friends we we're just all in this we're just all in this journey together we all love the Lord we all want to with all of our hearts we all want to make Heaven our home we we all want to we all want to live the life that that that God would have us live and be pleasing to the Lord and we've all had different backgrounds and things that we've come through but every one of us really want the same thing out of life I think if you pull don't matter how divided this country is mainly it seems like politically now but it don't matter how divided it is I bet if you ask most Americans in this country what is the thing that you would want out of life I would imagine most of the people probably 70 upwards of probably over 70 75% of people would say I just want to have a good life I just want to be healthy uh uh uh live comfortably uh maybe on a house maybe not you getting a little specifics about house car and things like that but people just want to be happy people just want to live their lives people just want to uh uh to to to be comfortable in life and just enjoy life amen we just want to serve God we just want to live for God I just want to give God everything I've got do I slip yeah do I fall yeah do I make mistakes yeah but praise God I get back up and I keep going on the same Journey the Lord put me on to start with just because I fail doesn't mean I'm lost right just because you fail doesn't mean you're lost if it if it was I'd have been gone a long time ago right amen every one of us just keep going get up and keep going just keep just keep on that same Journey yeah another trial comes another thing happens Satan's not going to leave you alone but God uses that to mold us yeah God uses that to increase our faith God uses that to help bring us to the place that we need to be because it's going to take more than what we've got now for a changing of a body and a Rapture to take place amen that's the word god brings that word but when we start putting one another down and put one another route we work so hard to try to win souls to Christ and next thing you know we're working even harder to try to P somebody out just because they don't see it the way we do right I mean that sounds more counterproductive how is that edifying to the body of Christ when we're trying to shove people out just because they don't see it or act like it or look whatever the way we do again nothing sinful I'm not talking about that but just because they don't come to our mold of what they we think they should be I had some now I'm going to say something if you disagree that's okay that we we can disagree can't we and we can still be Christians and we can still love one another you can still be my brother or sister amen but I heard someone say one time that because they had the Holy Ghost they should all be acting the same scripturally yes but I disagree with that because I'm different than that person yes Amen brother random like to fish and hunt and I loved it growing up but I hadn't fished and hunted in I don't know how long I haven't I haven't gone hunting I've shot guns with our friends we had the the Alderson we used to go out in the desert and shoot with guns and uh pistols rifles shotguns whatever and just mik goes sometimes to shooting range with his friends and they shoot and stuff like that but I haven't actually been hunting to go hunting for animal in a countless years maybe even since I was in North Carolina growing up as a boy I was out in the woods all the time hunting or fishing I would get up at 6:00 in the morning on sun on the summer break I would go down to a local pond I catch some fish come home and clean them and cook them and uh cook son you may not he cut the potatoes and the french fries I'd make my my lunch from the fish I just got out of the pond and that was my life I love doing that but I haden't done that in Years brother Ram love to do it people around the message oh my if you don't hunt you're not a m M believer seems like sometimes in some circles anyway if you don't go hunt you how could you if you don't drive a Ford how could you be how could you be a CHR how can you believe a believer of this message not drive a forward it it gets to that point see and I you probably known some of those people I know some of those people if you don't see it like this then you're just not a part of it see I just disagree with that I still want to consider those people my brother and sister I still hope and pray that they consider me their brother and sister receive them not to doubtful disputations some have this some have that but we're all one don't put that one out because they don't see it the way you do don't put that one because they don't see it the way you do my my son loves to cook he actually was a sushia for a while I hate it I I some of the traits that he's had the enjoyments that I I like I I never unless I just had to ever wanted to cook anything period nothing I I don't like raw food but I hate to cook and he enjoys it he likes it and doing all they do to Cooks meals up I don't even know what you call anyway that doesn't make me wrong and him right or him right and me wrong we're just we're part of the same body amen what if what if nobody liked cooking we would we be right what if nobody could cook I would be in trouble Saints amen you understand uh it it's like let's go over to First Corinthians let's read this before I get any further and I'm going to 1 Corinthians 12 where it talks about the gifts of the Spirit but I don't want to Major on the gifts necessarily I want major own Giver right amen but in in saying that to help us understand by what Paul is telling the Corinthians amen now he told him he said I fed you with milk and not me we understand that but you know sometimes a good State needs a good glass of milk to wash it down amen I agree with that anyway sometimes some places they they get so it seems like so revelated in the word that it chokes people people out right you're like you know what uh tell me I need to love my brother at least every once in a while well that's just simple we should know that well yeah we should but Peter said I'd like to bring things up to bring it back to your remembrance so that you remember that hey you you you you might be all highly Mighty revelated but you still need to love your brother and that comes down to the very cruxs and the Simplicity of what the gospel is and who Jesus Christ is that's why he laid down his life that's why there was a Calvary because he had love for the Brethren amen amen 1 Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is one one body amen at many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ and we are that mystical body of Jesus Christ right for about one Spirit are we all baptized into one body not not the word of God Tabernacle body and the truson Tabernacle body and the open door Tabernacle body and the Shalom Tabernacle body and all the other just in Tucson those where you got those four there's then there's a dozen bodies in Tucson alone no one body amen amen there's a reason why God has you here reason why he has me here reason why he has them there or them over there amen by one Spirit we're all baptized into that one body whether it be jew or Gentile whether it be Bond or free and and have all been made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many so this one body has many members praise the lord we did not come off an assembly line we weren't all to be looking alike or sounding alike or acting alike or having every what if everybody was a was a pastor that'd be nobody out there right amen what what if everyone was something other than a pastor what if there what if there W no ministers then there would be nobody here amen let's go on for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not a hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body of course it is and the ear shall say because I am not an eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole body if the ears aren't a part of the body then we can't hear anything if the ears are not if the eyes are not a part of the body then you can't see if the feet are not a part of the body you can't walk the hands not a part of the body you can't grab things if amen but it takes a hand it takes a foot it takes the fingers it takes the ears takes the eyes takes the nose takes the head takes the legs the head is the intelligence the mouth is what speaks but what would the mind be without the mouth you could think the most brilliant things in the world but unless you could speak them what good is it going to do or at least write them down if it was all a brain If it just one big brain you could come up you could have the uh the absolute omnipotent mind of God and what good would it do right amen you couldn't speak it you couldn't write anything down you couldn't Express Yourself of those tremendously uh Eternal thoughts without having some way to express it amen that's why God put his life in us so that he in his eternal godness he's in his all all Mighty omnipotence has vessels that he can use to express himself to and through that's Us Praise the Lord hallelujah God is not just the father amen he's not just a son he's not just the Loos the Holy Spirit he's all those things God's Not Just A Healer amen I love his healing and his healing is awesome and Powerful but he's not just a Healer amen you understand amen so what about the equating of that to us as individuals as you as as each one of us as all of the body of Christ not just in this church but all around the world we're all a part of that mystical body of Jesus Christ we're all different speak different languages amen look now 18th verse but now have God set the members every one of them in the body is that has pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body uh if if if we if we were I don't like calling people's names but if we're if we were all uh a a big dang minister in this message who would preach to little groups like us amen if if everybody were like a so and so then how would the other people get riched amen I've gone and listen to ministers and come out completely and totally and utterly confused admittedly others in there seem to know exactly what the brother was talking about I said well that's wonderful he and his way of speaking however he can get to a certain group of people amen I believe I remember one time talking to brother Mark stor everybody anybody I can remember the name of his book astonished that his doctor you ever read astonished that his doctor brother Mark strok wrote astonished at his doctr I can't get through the first chapter I couldn't get through the first page hardly I mean there is some really he there's some very there's words in there I don't even know what it means can't pronounce them I mean brother Mark's a very intelligent man and he can talk like that he can write like that and that's wonderful thank God there's somebody can do that but he wrote that book for that purpose but that book wasn't written to reach me cuz that book's going to do nothing for me because I don't understand it but it can reach others that are in the same kind of mental uh intelligence as brother Mark and that'll reach those people and that's why he wrote it he wrote it in that way to reach those people amen when the Lord had me write the book I did I didn't make it a message book I didn't feel I didn't feel God wanted me to write it as a message book you'll look or if you've read my book you'll notice in there I don't mention brother bam but I think once maybe twice in the whole book it wasn't wrote to be that way it was wrote I felt under the inspiration of God to write it to reach Christians amen as a Bible believer as a bible-based book amen now will it reach a common person I don't know because there's a lot of scripture in that book and if you don't know the Scripture it would probably be confusing to you unless a person goes and searches all that scripture out but I wrote it based on what the Lord showed me to try to reach Christians people who know the Bible believe the Bible uh and have that type of mental acuity and that spiritual Acuity amen see it's it's meant to reach that group that book brother Markman was meant to reach that group amen it won't reach me that brother who preached and I was utterly confused did not touch me it did not reach me but it reached apparently a lot of other people there and that's great that that's wonderful it should be that way that doesn't mean that brother was wrong just because I didn't understand him it it just meant that God had him in a certain way to speak to a certain person or certain people and that's why they're here and that's why they do what they do and that's why God's made me who I've made who who he's made me I've had a lot of people tell me that brother you you just make things so plain I said I don't I no I don't I I don't do that it may come out that way but I don't purposely do that that's I guess I'm just a simpleton I guess you know way I can explain it is in simple terms that's all I know I don't have the great swelling intelligence of like brother Mark and brother Dale and them that can do this I can't speak like that so it it it may sound plain or real but that's not me that's God it's just that that that's the gift of each one to do it that way amen and each one is to reach each people to reach a certain group or to read certain people because I I've had I've heard and had people say say you know everybody in Tucson there should just be one message church in Tucson everybody should go to that one church I don't agree with that as as unified as we should be right and we should be regardless of what church we go to what pastor we are or what or or or the pastors themselves and that's probably been one of the biggest problems Tucson's ever had is because the ministry itself is not one right the ministry itself doesn't get together at all in agreement in anything and and together and you you I've tried to do it and i' and talked to different brothers and things and it it's a uh it's been a insurmountable heal at this point uh I hate to think of it this way but I kind of gave up because it was just that hard uh that difficult to break loose but unfortunately and everybody's busy and all the things is it just is the way it is but we should all still be a part of the same body even though we don't go to the same church right amen amen I had people telling me said why after I started the church over in cero and tab was one to brother Mark stro Corps they like why does your daughter go to Marx I said because that's where she feels led to go and you're okay with that's said absolutely she's in church she's taking her son to church she's where the Lord has sent her amen that's all that mattered to me amen well you that that's awful big I said no it's not it it it's just that's just the way it is doesn't matter as long as their word God tells them to be that's what matters amen that's all that matters to me and and that's all that matters to me in my life and I trust that's all that matters to you in your life and it's all that way for a reason but if we have one big church you gotta you've got a pastor you know there's that that that brother with that gift is to reach this group but there's another brother why do you think God separated Paul and S or Paul and uh um Barnabas he separated them so they could go their separate ways so one could reach this and the other could reach this plus they reached more people as they were a separate group than they were the two of them together the two of them together they could only go to One location the two of them separate could go to two locations and Barnabas reached people I'm sure Paul didn't reach and vice versa for a reason it's not supposed to like we have one church in Tucson that would be great but you know where we're going to have one grand Church reunion is on the other side and that's what matters amen it doesn't matter that we're all in one big building here in Tucson or we have one Pastor there's a reason it's that way amen now is some maybe not of God maybe but that's not me to call right if they're there doing what they're doing and that's not the will of the Lord that's not my business that's God's business my business is that is still my brother yeah that is still my sister they are still a part of the same body as far as I'm concerned as I am that's the body of Jesus Christ that's the way I think God sees it and that's the way it should be amen maybe there's there should be hearing there should be be smelling there should be thinking there should be walking there should be grabbing there should be talking there should be seeing there should be all a part of the body of Christ is coming together to make up that one beautiful body of Jesus Christ that's the way we should that's the way it should be in in in all of our ways of doing what we do and how we do it a lot of people disagree with brother green and and some things brother green did I disagree with but that I I love that man much as anybody amen and I believe he fulfilled the purpose God gave him to fulfill and what he did and how he did it I personally think when a pastor a person's called to be a pastor they have a home church that's where they should be I don't think a pastor should be traveling all over the country I think brother green had a specific certain call to do what he did and he had a home Church to come to that help support him and bring him to the place that he could do that amen that's my opinion okay that and $10 give you a cup of coffee and Starbucks that doesn't mean much but that's my opinion it's Val me mean something to me but that's why God did what he did but I to me a a a pastor shouldn't be going preaching all churches all across the country and be gone two or three months at a time and having vised ministers just coming in revolving door in their church not normally but that's my opinion but now do I say that that brother that's up to him that's again that's between him and God right if he thinks it's okay to be his home Church two months out of a year then uh do whatever you feel God's telling you to do right I don't see that in the scripture but whatever you feel to do is up to you amen I I don't say that brother's not my brother I I just disagree with that amen amen I believe God made the fivefold ministry is for a purpose yes amen and he set some pastors evangelists missionaries teachers prophets he set them all in there for a reason to do a specific thing Amen to fulfill a specific office praise the Lord the Evangelist is an evangelist let him go evangelize let him go and hit those churches where a pastor should be pastoring his church what kind of a flock is it going to be if the pastor pastors his flock for a little while and then he says okay you guys will be all right I'll I'll just send a hirling in here to come and take care of you for a while I'm going to be gone you think anyway that that's just my opinion probably getting a little too detailed but that's my opinion God put that missionary to do what he does that evangelist to do what he does the pastor to do what he does the teacher to do what he there it's all a part of the Great mystical body right amen that the that the whole body come into a place of perfection or maturity amen as members as as part of the body of Christ amen but now are they 21st are many members yet but one body and the ey cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are they seem to be more feeble but they are necessary but it seems like everybody wants to be the one that speaks in tongues everybody wants to be the one that gives that great prophecy or everybody wants to be that one that's on the camera and preaches and behind a pull pit but that's not the way God set the body up right amen amen but the ones that sit on the back pew that attend faithfully and pay their ties faithfully and are faithful to the post of Duty and those that have this just the simplest of gifts are just as important as the one that pastors of 20,000 never Church he's just as important in the body of Christ he is just as important amen unfortunately we as humans we have respect for a person God doesn't as we have respect for a person unfortunately in our carnality we look at it and see that person is more important amen I've had ministers and there were there was times in my young life of ministering that I wanted to to be like a certain Minister CU he was so popular and and big church and all this stuff and God told me one time I didn't call you to be that person I called that person to be that person I called this one to be that person I didn't call you to be like them I've had other ministers tell me I P literally I patterned my Ministry after so and so I said why would you do that yeah if God's give you your own Ministry why would you want to be in pattered yourself after some other minister right I wouldn't even want to pattern myself after brother Brandon as far as that goes right amen amen I want to be what God called me to be yes I want to be where God called me to go I want to be do what God has called me in life to do amen because that is just as important again as a person who may have 10 20 30 40,000 members in his church or or or or have a great uh a gift of some kind people call it great gifts those that are out forward gifts the gifts we get down here in the last verses of of this um uh the gifts of uh the gifts of healing the the uh the the uh Gifts of Miracles the gift of heals the gift of governments the gift nobody sees those things th those are things that are done outside of the Limelight the gift of helps for example I had a brother one time he asked me he says I don't even I a been in the message been serving the lord for 40 years I I I don't think the Lord's giv me gift I I don't know that I have any kind of a gift I said are you kidding me to me and knowing him as as intimately as I have over so many years I'm like you absolutely have a gift a glaring gift that is absolutely identified in the scripture yeah anybody come in he take them out to L see if they had a place to stay drive them where they need to go be there for that person whatever they needed or wanted to do and he come to me and says y' don't think I have a gift I said are you kidding me and I think a lot of people are probably like that they just live their lives and they just do what's on their heart to do and don't realize that's a gift of the spirit that God's given them to be that way and to do those things and to act like that they don't even realize it they're just living their life but they're living their life based on what God gave him to do amen I said brother right here look 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 28 says that they have the gifts of healings heths and governments I said if you don't have a gift of helps I don't think it ever existed amen cuz that's all the brother ever did for other people was help and be there pay for a meal or something or whatever amen but it's it's it's not out front it's not it's it's not in the Limelight it's it's something that happens that nobody ever sees hardly nobody ever knows about I might not myself if I didn't know the person very very well I wouldn't have know but it's just goes to show God has each of us doing what we do there's for a reason amen uh brother grantom even talked about those that are coming around and uh the gifts of the Spirit the Lord was using with the gift in the hand and the discernment and all and he said you know you the Lord does something and next thing you know you got a 100 impersonators they all got a gift in the hand now something's happening they're vibrating or bumps or whatever something's going on or you the the the gift of discernment all of a sudden you got another 100 ministers around the country and they got this great gift they can see things and and they can say this person and you know your name is You Know M I was just getting ready to say that you didn't have to say and you know they're like I they had this great gift you live in the United States yeah born here lived here my whole life that's not very uh enlightening but uh but there all has to come these caral impersonations and that's what brother R called them just caral impersonations they all wanted to do this or be this person or have this kind of a gift or something and and it can be impersonated absolutely any of those brother mam said any gift of God Satan can impersonate yes he just cannot bring this word word by word amen he cannot get the Holy Ghost if he did that he would come through the blood of Jesus Christ he came through the blood of Jesus Christ he'd be your brother not your adversary yes amen he cannot create he cannot bring this word impersonate gifts oh absolutely amen he speaking tongues or whatever brother talked about seeing devil speaking tongues get up a pencil write unknown tongues nothing about God at all satanic to the core satanic amen but it's an impersonation that's what we have a lot of caral impersonations but friend we need each other amen my son likes to cook and I love to eat we make a great couple amen we make a great son father son CU he likes to cook and I like to eat so great amen it works for me so anyway let's finish this those members of the body look now always get put out those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant cess for our calmly Parts have no need but God have tempered praise the Lord God has tempered God has fused the body together yes having given more abundant honor to that part which life praise the Lord that there should be no Schism no division no wedge driven in the body of Christ that uh but that the members should have the same care one for another yes amen and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles second early prophets early teachers after that Miracles Gifts of healings heals governments diversity of tongues are all Apostles no are all prophets no are all teachers no are all M workers of Miracles no we are not amen but those gifts are there are given in the body for a reason not to everybody but for particular reason for particular people now every one of us is called to pray every one of us is called to pray for the sake any one of us could come and lay hands and pray over a person it's not talking about that that's part the body of Christ but a but a gift in particular amen of of this these gifts have all the gifts of healing no do all speak with tongues no do all in like what some people will tell you not all people do speak in tongues not all people interpret amen cover earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way that's brother br says a couple thingsam said here look return in Jubilee 1962 he said what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of God's placing in the church himself every member every stone every place every Christian to itself praise God you know what that includes me amen that includes the janitor that includes the person that sits in the back that includ amen that includes everyone to hit to itself each one of us in our particular way peculiar way has a place in the house of God peculiar way that mean well who are we peculiar to we're not peculiar to God because he's the one that made us who are we peculiar to other people each other even if you will every peculiar way has a place in the house of God like Solomon's Temple when it was cut out all over the world but when it was brought into japa floated in to doog cart these old rocks had their place when the temple went together and I think that God like a jigsaw B amen every piece is cut for its purpose you can't take the one piece and put it in the corner if it belongs in the middle it doesn't fit amen now sometimes people try to make themselves a corner piece when they're a center piece or vice versa but it doesn't fit yes amen and that and that does eventually come to fruition and I think that God down through this time has cut out some very odd Stones amen uh y'all looking at one very odd Stone I'm looking at some odd Stones too amen that we might have uh that we might not have understood but they have their place in exactly in the temple in the building of God and isn't that what matters is it that the thing that's the most important we all have that place in the body all fitly joined together in the body of Christ thirsting for Life 1960 now I obeyed him I obeyed him in my peculiar way and you obeyed him in your your way he gives us both the Holy Ghost so we ought to be Christian Brethren and sister enough to arm up together and March on for one great purpose and that's the gospel amen amen together that God made us called us to be one amen remember remember how uh brother gream told us when he was uh going through the church age book and they were they were uh uh brother brother green was reading the church age book brother Brown they were going up the road uh British Columbia or up up that way I believe it was and they were riding together brother Rand was driving brother Rand brother green had the church age book they were proof reading it and he was reading the church H book to brother brandham and he got to that place in the in the church H book where it expressed brother bram's experience when he received the Holy Ghost and brother gram said and brother green was reading and said it was like a rain pelting experience youall know what I'm sure you know what I'm talking about brother green said many times it's like a rain pelting experience brother said wait a minute wait read that again brother per he said when you got the Holy Ghost brother random that it felt like a rain melting experience he said no no he said take that out he said why brother random said people are going to want to know what happened to you and how you felt and how it happened to you and that kind of thing because we all have our own testimony he said no if you put that in there all the Believers that trust in me going to think that they have to have a rain pelting experience before they have to get the Holy Ghost he said and that was the way I got it not everybody gets it like that in fact he may have been the only human ever walked this rock that ever got it that way amen and the way I got it may have been the one person ever got it the way I got it and you the same but brother Ram wanted to make sure if they trusted in brother Ram enough and and and held him in such confidence that if he said that he got a rain peling experience that everybody else before they believed that they had the holy ghost that they would have to have a rain peling experience he said take it out that makes sense amen because brother bram's different brother bram's we're all different but his experience our experiences I didn't have a r healthy experience amen I was more of a sunshine experience if you will but everybody's different it's up to each individual but you understand why brother random had brother green take that out of the book because everybody would think they have to have the exact same thing to before they believe that they had the Holy Ghost amen and it's not that way for everybody look here I'll close just a minute it is it is I Be not Afraid 1962 he said but one Spirit by one Spirit we're all baptized into the same body and the way that we can set here tonight a rainbow is Covenant God's God's God don't you believe that amen what if the rainbow was all blue what if it was all yellow amen just be a big yellow thing up there it still be pretty because God doesn't make anything that's not but it's what the beauty of it is is the colors of it amen the meshing of the colors together the way God made it amen set of rainbows a covenant God's a god of variety don't you believe that God don't have everything like a Sears and robu like I said cookie cutter Harmony House no sir God's a god of variety he makes big mountains he makes little mountains he makes he makes deserts he makes seeds he makes Little Men He makes big men he makes white flowers black flowers blue flowers pink flowers he's the god of Ry and that's the way he wants it and we are simply that bouquet of the body that God has made amen whether you're a tulip or whether you're a rose or whether you're a crysanthemum or whether whatever we're all in the same bouquet the same bouquet of God Amen not every flower is a rose not every flower is a lily some people love roses some people love lies some people favor other uh baby sprads or whatever or pansies everybody favors whatever this my favorite a lot of times feel what is your favorite SE Ando what is your favorite plant what is your favorite Cactus what is your favorite uh place to live I had a lot of people ask me when I drove I said well I've lived at the ocean I've lived in the peont in North Carolina I've lived in the desert I've lived in the mountain 6,000 7,000 feet in Pine tub so what was your favorite place well I like them all there was something about all of them that I like when I was in one I missed the other place and when I went to the other place there was things about that place that I missed and when I went over here there was things about this place that I missed I enjoyed being there especially when you're doing what God tells you to do amen and you know you're where you're supposed to be that brings more joy than anything and happiness but so which one did you like well I like this about this place and I like this about this place and I like this about this place and amen it it it just it is we just came from uh Wisconsin beautiful right on Lake Michigan right there you see the huge body of water and the trees and grass and it was just it's just a beautiful place reminding me even told the guy riding with he's talking about the house I yeah yeah reminds me at the houses in North Carolina where I from kind of makes me homesick and he said well they were like that I said yeah he said well yeah those are pretty houses I said yeah there's pretty houses here too I mean it's just it's it's just it's God's variety amen when you enjoy and I I had people in the car say well I I like the water I said well you better not move to Tucson amen unless you want to turn on your faucet every day for an hour or something don't move to Tucson we don't even have water in our Rivers um you better not come here better head West to the ocean or or one of the ocean or something if you like water uh you got to go some place that's got water because we don't have any why you know I like the dry I don't like the humidity well you better not move to Florida uh Louisiana we're good about that here I can't stand the heat don't move here then I can't stand the cold well here's the place for you you know it's just that what what do you like the most what is your favorite what's your favorite food if I've had this question ask me if you were going to die tomorrow you were on the electric chair and you were supposed to in there ask what's your last meal what would you eat I bet almost everybody in here have something different they would say Amen but that doesn't make you wrong right doesn't make me wrong it's just what I enjoy amen I go to I go on my team I work in 19 uh my my boss I told him about what happened with Joel and being prayed for and how much better my knees were they still a little sore sore and stiff during the week but I never took a single paint and never had to take a single paint pill first time in well I can't remember two or three months whatever it's been not never had to take a single pain pill all week by the grace of God and we get to lunch one day you know and I was limping a little bit it's hard I mean when you're standing on your feet on concrete 12 hours plus a day no it get to anybody but uh he said he told the kogan the Brian he was telling him he said well well do you think Newton could tell a lie you think that he really would he really tell us a lie and Brian just looked at him and said newon only tells the truth that God gives him to tell I said really I couldn't believe he said that but that's just what he said he said you only tell the truth of God's truth or something to that effect us wow um he's got more confidence to me than I do cuz I know that's not true there's times that I've done things that is absolutely wrong amen I try not to but we're all human anyway I thought that was just unusual but that but um it good thing about it is we all kind of like the same places but uh but just the group in itself is so different amen but the good part about it and I think a reason that we do good is because it's some people like doing certain things more than others and some people are better at other things than other and there's so much to be done that this person does that well and enjoys it some person does that well and enjoys it and some person does that well and enjoys it and that's what makes a team the team is one there's many members there's several of us but there's one team and this person does that and this and this and and they're good at it and they like doing it but it's one team and we and we come together as one team praise the Lord and and and it works because that's that's what's in each of us to do it's all a part of that same it's just God's it's just God's variety amen we're all a part of God's variety that God has made us that way don't ever discount I I've SE things I that you know I I'll hold my opinion A lot of times to myself that I think you know that's just not right right and some things is probably not even scriptural or some things that I've heard preach that I'm like I've never found that in the Bible I've never heard brother brand say that uh but I try to give the benefit of the doubt but I do know that that's probably not unless something else happens or God shows me not somebody I'm going to go here preach again if I don't think they're preaching the scripture the message of scripture I I I'm just not going to go hear that person uh I've been to a I've been to a service where the minister was very insulting to a certain group that was there and I thought very condescending and and uh I I thought you know um I I'll probably never hear that person preach again because I just that's just not something now other people may like that there's a lot of laughing going on and and enjoying and that's up to them that's not something I enjoy right and I I don't I don't want to be a part of that but that's just me now do I think that person's going to hell no I'm not I wouldn't ever dare go there that's between them and God again that's between them and God praise the Lord but I know that is the as the bouquet of God the variety that God has made we're all part of the same mystical body of Jesus Christ we're all just trying to live our the best life we can for God trying to do the best that we can uh sometimes as a pastor and a pastor's wife and people that we've had through the years we think why did does that person do that it never comes out right and they still do it just it baffles us to no end sometimes but that's that's the discussion between me and my wife and it's things that we leave before the Lord but that doesn't but that person is still just a part of the body of Christ as anybody amen still love him as much as anybody uh from Florida and and around wherever it's been some things you just don't understand but I'm sure there's things that I've done that other people don't understand that didn't make sense to them but we're still just trying to live the life that God's called to be that witness to be that person to be that portion that God wants us to be amen in our Oddities brother R call us oddballs preach the message called the Oddball and that's exactly what we're odd not just to the world we some of us sometimes we're odd to one another amen but we love and expect and receive one another as a part of that body of Christ that's what makes up the whole body praise the
