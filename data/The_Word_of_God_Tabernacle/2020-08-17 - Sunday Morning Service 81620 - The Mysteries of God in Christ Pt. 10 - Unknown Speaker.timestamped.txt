[0:44] prayer requests
[0:45] it looks like it's it looks like my
[0:47] video is still not working right for
[0:49] some reason
[0:51] it's still buffering too much
[0:56] as long as it stays on and we can
[0:59] keep it going will be all right um
[1:02] just want to make sure it's going to
[1:03] work the way it's supposed to
[1:05] and that everybody gets on and becomes a
[1:08] part of it like we're
[1:11] like we're supposed to so just give it a
[1:13] minute and see how this works out and
[1:16] if it goes any further from here so it
[1:18] looks live now
[1:19] looks like everything's okay uh it's
[1:22] still buffering though
[1:24] i don't know i don't know why
[1:27] it's not receiving enough uh from the
[1:30] internet or what's going on
[1:33] um strength so um
[1:36] it's like maybe people are getting on a
[1:38] little bit at a time
[1:40] and one or two at a time
[1:44] and see how this works out
[1:47] yeah it's still saying it's not
[1:49] receiving enough video
[1:53] so i'm sure i'm not sure how to fix that
[1:57] um so hopefully you'll be able to
[2:00] receive the audio
[2:02] uh if not i am recording this as well so
[2:05] at least you can have the audio of it if
[2:08] maybe not the video
[2:09] so hopefully we'll keep this going and
[2:12] uh
[2:12] have this so that
[2:15] you can be a participant and be part of
[2:17] it so it'll work out okay
[2:19] so anyway uh we're gonna move on
[2:22] and i'm gonna go to revelation chapter
[2:25] uh 10 verse seven
[2:26] uh we're now on mysteries of god in
[2:28] christ part number ten
[2:30] and having the queen and his people part
[2:33] number two
[2:34] uh so we want to continue with that
[2:36] we'll see if this doesn't
[2:38] pick up the way it should and flow
[2:41] through like i'm hoping it does or maybe
[2:43] if the video shuts off
[2:44] i'll just make this a little short pick
[2:46] this up next week
[2:48] like i said hopefully if you're watching
[2:50] this or you do watch this later
[2:52] uh we're hopefully gonna have the
[2:54] building in the position next week to be
[2:56] able to
[2:57] meet there and have live service there
[2:59] so uh that's what the hope is and
[3:02] and mike it can be on the streaming and
[3:03] then we can have somebody that knows
[3:05] what they're doing
[3:06] work on it i'm good if i push a few
[3:09] buttons and everything works fine
[3:11] i'm fine but when there's a hiccup or
[3:14] there's something that's not working
[3:15] quite right
[3:16] i'm not the person to fix it when it
[3:18] comes to a computer so
[3:19] i'm not always very good at that but uh
[3:22] anyway
[3:23] so we'll just move on from here now and
[3:25] again as we have we'll start with the
[3:27] same scripture reading in revelation
[3:29] chapter 10 verse 7
[3:31] will read this to begin uh today
[3:35] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[3:37] day angel when he shall begin to sound
[3:39] the mystery of god
[3:40] should be finished as he had declared to
[3:43] his servants
[3:44] the prophets man now again we've gotten
[3:47] into part
[3:47] two uh of uh having the preeminence in
[3:51] his people
[3:52] so i want to go back to that scripture
[3:53] that we read last week
[3:55] and uh and get back to that again and
[3:57] just read a couple of verses of
[3:59] scripture from there
[4:00] to kick start that from where we left
[4:03] off last week
[4:04] uh last week we read colossians uh
[4:07] chapter one began at verse 12. let's
[4:09] just read verses
[4:11] 18 and 19 this time to draw our context
[4:14] again remember god having
[4:16] the preeminence in his people uh is the
[4:19] second
[4:20] part of that christ the mystery of god
[4:22] revealed remember the first
[4:23] is not revealing himself to
[4:27] known to his people the second is god
[4:29] having the preeminence
[4:31] in those people and a very paramount
[4:34] part
[4:35] because god hadn't revealed himself to
[4:37] us if god hadn't opened himself or
[4:39] condescended
[4:40] to the point that we could see him and
[4:42] that god could reveal himself to us
[4:44] then there's no way that it ever would
[4:46] have happened where
[4:47] um um you know we could have
[4:50] he could have the preeminence in us so
[4:53] uh but that that verse of scripture here
[4:55] is colossians chapter 1 verse 18
[4:59] and he is the head of the body the
[5:01] church
[5:02] who is the beginning of the uh who is
[5:04] the beginning the firstborn from the
[5:06] dead
[5:07] that in all things he might have the
[5:09] preeminence
[5:10] for it please the father that in him
[5:13] should all
[5:14] fullness dwell amen now again we're
[5:17] majoring on that 18th
[5:23] you to see verse again as we read last
[5:25] week it's not just
[5:26] the bible doesn't just say god having
[5:29] the preeminence in his people
[5:31] is saying that god would have
[5:32] preeminence in all things
[5:35] he is the head of the body
[5:38] now we'll take a few minutes and we'll
[5:40] try to get into that just just for a few
[5:42] moments again
[5:43] uh with this acting up the way it is
[5:45] i'll probably make this a little
[5:47] shorter but let's look at this just for
[5:49] a few moments because
[5:51] just you know we need weekly food and i
[5:54] want to give you what i thought the lord
[5:55] gave me yesterday or
[5:56] part of this so uh but that part majors
[5:59] in 18 first year
[6:01] he is the head of the body the church
[6:05] body church body bride uh we are the
[6:08] bride body
[6:09] amen because remember uh we talked many
[6:12] times about
[6:13] the differentiation between the bride of
[6:15] jesus christ and the church
[6:17] the church is nominal the bride is his
[6:19] wife uh
[6:20] the bride is making herself correct the
[6:22] body uh
[6:24] is the head of the body see who is the
[6:26] beginning
[6:27] the first born from the dead that in all
[6:30] things
[6:31] all things he might have the preeminence
[6:34] now that's that key word the preeminence
[6:36] again
[6:37] we talked about last week what it meant
[6:39] to have that preeminence of what
[6:41] the imminence was or your imminence and
[6:44] before
[6:45] because remember it says in the
[6:47] scripture here that he was
[6:48] before all things so we look at that
[6:52] again and see he's the beginning uh
[6:55] from the dead that in all things have
[6:56] not had the preeminence
[6:58] but if you look over um see if i can
[7:01] find it here
[7:03] it tells us in the same chapter that he
[7:06] was
[7:07] the before all things and that pre
[7:10] is the word before the 17th verse we
[7:13] didn't read that part
[7:14] and he is before all things and by him
[7:18] all things consist remember that prefix
[7:20] pre
[7:21] a part of that definition is pre means
[7:25] before all things or pre imminence he is
[7:28] the superiority
[7:30] well being the superiority makes him the
[7:32] head
[7:33] it makes him the one that's in control
[7:35] and when i look that up for
[7:37] uh today or yesterday it really
[7:41] um it really struck me what this head
[7:43] means here
[7:44] uh so if you go into the same colossians
[7:47] 1 18
[7:48] and you look in the greek of the word
[7:50] head
[7:51] it means it says the head of both
[7:55] of both men and often animals
[7:58] so you think about that in relation to
[8:01] what the scripture just said
[8:02] that in all things
[8:06] see in all things head both of men
[8:10] and often of animals since the loss of
[8:13] the head
[8:14] destroys life amen
[8:17] so it's vitally important that this body
[8:21] be attached to the head and that the
[8:24] head come
[8:25] on the body so that the body has life in
[8:28] it and it is a viable
[8:30] life see because the loss of the head
[8:33] destroys the life see anything
[8:37] now in metaphor anything that is supreme
[8:41] the head chief prominent
[8:45] of persons being the master
[8:48] and lord amen where we left off last
[8:51] week remember where we left off last
[8:52] week
[8:53] having the preeminence makes him lord
[8:57] making him lord is lord of your life he
[9:00] is the master he is the head
[9:02] he is the controller he is the one who
[9:05] who uh
[9:05] moves us and controls us and we are
[9:08] obedient to him remember paul said i am
[9:10] not of my own
[9:12] i am bought with a price so see we don't
[9:14] belong to ourselves
[9:15] we belong to him see and he and he is
[9:19] our master and lord
[9:21] of a husband look at this now uh we
[9:24] won't get to this scripture today but of
[9:26] a husband
[9:26] in relation to his wife see the head
[9:30] just like uh in ephesians five we'll
[9:32] read probably
[9:33] lord willing next week of christ the
[9:36] lord of the husband
[9:38] and the church of things the cornerstone
[9:41] see now that's the head the head that
[9:44] he's talking about
[9:45] the head of the body which we just read
[9:48] that is what the head means
[9:50] the head means that he is master he is
[9:52] lord he is supreme he is
[9:54] uh of the of the authority
[9:58] in an authoritative position makes him
[10:00] supreme makes him the head
[10:02] he is the head now looking at this head
[10:05] for a moment in this body
[10:07] because it's a complete body because
[10:09] remember we're a part of him
[10:11] so if he's going to have preeminence
[10:13] he's going to have preeminence in
[10:14] everything and in all ways
[10:16] so in that we are one unit
[10:20] we are not separate units christ and the
[10:23] bride
[10:23] are not separate units she has become
[10:26] one flesh
[10:27] she has become one unit and that one
[10:29] unit together we are together as one
[10:32] unit
[10:33] he's simply the head and in the head
[10:36] that's come down
[10:37] is to cap off that body so the
[10:40] intelligence of christ
[10:41] in the body of christ is fulfilling and
[10:44] living the purpose
[10:46] that god has for us in this earth today
[10:48] yet
[10:49] thus having the preeminence that
[10:52] preeminence now
[10:53] that's in the body that's in the bride
[10:55] that preeminency
[10:57] and that whole preeminence is what he
[10:59] does in us
[11:01] one unit we are one flesh we are one
[11:04] bone
[11:04] we come and we'll get to that lord
[11:06] willing and having that preeminence one
[11:09] flesh and one bone
[11:10] notice now him being the head it brings
[11:14] it to that position the
[11:15] head is is literal
[11:19] it is a literal term and it is and it is
[11:22] also used as an adjective
[11:25] a head in other words a head is a
[11:27] literal head
[11:28] you look at my head here is literal it
[11:31] is a literal head
[11:32] the head is also an adjective as in
[11:36] the head of something or someone
[11:39] or corporation or a company uh or
[11:43] or a country or something like that
[11:45] that's an adjective describing someone
[11:48] that is in control of someone or
[11:51] someone's or some business or something
[11:53] else they are in control
[11:56] so the head of something is in control
[11:58] in authority figure
[12:00] over others see they're in control
[12:03] that's what the head is
[12:04] it's not literal head like sitting on my
[12:07] shoulders
[12:08] see but it is a figurative it is an
[12:10] adjective to say that that person as the
[12:13] head
[12:14] is in control now also
[12:17] body is the same way body is a
[12:20] literal term but it's also an adjective
[12:24] term and to say that you look at my body
[12:28] this is a body this is literal this
[12:30] literal head
[12:31] is literal body but there's also a
[12:34] figurative
[12:35] or an adjective body that is
[12:38] that would describe a a group of people
[12:42] or or a
[12:45] a gathering of water we call
[12:48] oceans a body of water uh
[12:52] we call gruesome people uh
[12:55] a body see they're they're a body
[12:58] together they're joined together
[13:00] they're there for a purpose common cold
[13:03] cause
[13:04] uh you call our congregation a body of
[13:06] people
[13:07] well that's a figurative or a an
[13:10] adjective used for the word body there's
[13:12] literal
[13:13] you say yes the head to the body is
[13:15] literal
[13:16] but there's also the figurative where
[13:18] you have the supreme authority
[13:20] over the body of people that make him
[13:24] that
[13:24] jesus christ that head over the
[13:27] adjective
[13:28] body of people that are together as one
[13:32] group as one unit
[13:33] for one goal for one purpose and that
[13:36] body comes together that way
[13:38] see so that head is over that body
[13:41] thus you read the scripture that he is
[13:44] the head of the body
[13:45] the church he is the head see and if
[13:48] he's that head
[13:50] then he's gonna have the preeminence
[13:52] remember that
[13:53] eminence preeminence is that first place
[13:57] the first place god's gonna have
[14:00] the first place or he's not going to
[14:03] have a place
[14:04] see and if we belong to god god will
[14:07] wait and we'll be in the position how
[14:10] many of us
[14:11] you know didn't just come right in with
[14:14] uh all barrels blazing you know
[14:16] sometimes we
[14:17] uh uh missed out a little bit
[14:21] or didn't come quite when we maybe
[14:24] should have or whatever you know and
[14:26] sometimes we uh backslide a little bit
[14:28] or something like that but god is always
[14:30] there
[14:31] patient waiting but he's gonna have in
[14:34] his body
[14:35] now he's gonna have the first place
[14:39] he's gonna have the preeminence as the
[14:42] head
[14:42] of the body as being the head now
[14:46] i want to move on uh quickly because
[14:48] again
[14:50] uh of the things that's going on here
[14:52] with the video
[14:53] but i want to turn into acts chapter
[14:55] four and i want order because there's a
[14:57] few
[14:58] places because you can look at this now
[15:00] acts chapter four
[15:01] we're going to begin with verse 8
[15:03] through 12.
[15:04] uh this is the middle of the story but
[15:07] that's where we're going to begin
[15:08] you can also find it psalms 118 22
[15:12] and luke 2017 david talks about it
[15:16] in psalms 118 and uh luke talks about it
[15:20] in
[15:20] 20th chapter 17 or jesus talks about it
[15:23] luke recorded it
[15:24] jesus talks about it in luke 2017
[15:27] okay so the subject here that we're
[15:29] going to talk about
[15:31] is the rejection of that head
[15:34] see the rejection of that head because
[15:37] he
[15:38] steal the head he's still the preeminent
[15:41] he's still the support
[15:42] the the uh uh the superiority
[15:46] over that bride over that body over the
[15:49] church
[15:50] amen he still disappeared you read in um
[15:54] revelation of all the church agents
[15:58] and he's still the the god of those
[16:00] church ages
[16:01] even though uh they shut him out or they
[16:04] push him out or
[16:05] you know the nominations don't want him
[16:07] uh certain
[16:09] entities people they don't want him see
[16:11] he came to his own and his own received
[16:13] him not
[16:14] so we read this that as peter put it
[16:16] here
[16:17] uh he's the healing of the impotent man
[16:20] in
[16:20] acts chapter 4. now we'll begin with the
[16:22] first date look at this
[16:25] apologizes uh videos
[16:28] uh just got me portable a little bit so
[16:30] i'm trying to work through that so
[16:32] uh god help us get that anointing amen
[16:36] then peter filled with the holy ghost
[16:39] said unto them
[16:40] ye rulers of the people and elders of
[16:43] israel
[16:44] if we this day be examined of the good
[16:48] deed
[16:49] done to the impotent man by what by what
[16:52] means he is made whole
[16:55] be it known unto you all and to all the
[16:58] people of israel
[17:00] that by the name of jesus christ of
[17:02] nazareth whom he crucified
[17:05] whom god raised from the dead even by
[17:07] him
[17:08] that this man stand here before you
[17:10] whole
[17:11] amen he was he wasn't ashamed now he got
[17:14] born again
[17:16] he got the holy ghost jesus told him
[17:18] when you're converted strength in the
[17:19] brothers
[17:20] uh that's exactly what he's doing he
[17:22] received a conversion in that upper room
[17:24] he was no more a coward
[17:26] he was no more running for his life he
[17:28] was nowhere yelling at young
[17:29] children and cursing he was no more
[17:31] denying jesus
[17:33] he was standing before them boldly
[17:35] claiming
[17:37] why and how this impotent man received
[17:40] healing
[17:41] and he told them straight out that by
[17:44] the name of jesus christ
[17:46] of nazareth who you crucified whom
[17:49] god raised from the dead even by him
[17:51] does this man stand before you whole
[17:53] praise the lord that's bold amen that's
[17:56] true
[17:57] he's standing holding it true but now
[18:00] look what he goes on to say
[18:01] this is the stone jesus is the stone
[18:05] which was set at not of you builders
[18:08] which has become the head of the corner
[18:11] now
[18:12] peter puts it as the head of the corner
[18:16] the head of the corner now notice
[18:18] something when when you're
[18:19] in building because well first of all
[18:23] let's get to the first part of this when
[18:24] we do that let's get to the first part
[18:26] he said
[18:26] this is the stone jesus christ is that
[18:29] stone
[18:30] amen that's not which was said not of
[18:33] you
[18:34] in other words what he's telling them is
[18:37] this stone which came to you this stone
[18:40] jesus christ the messiah god almighty
[18:43] which
[18:43] came to you and you set him at
[18:46] naught you called him worthless
[18:50] you called him a waste you called him
[18:53] nothing to you see that you said him at
[18:57] not in other words you considered him
[19:00] nothing to you you consider him a waste
[19:03] that's what he's telling them see he
[19:06] said this was that stone that came
[19:08] that stone that those religious men are
[19:11] standing there
[19:12] knew exactly what david said in psalms
[19:14] 2018.
[19:16] they knew exactly they were probably
[19:18] some were standing there
[19:19] when when luke recorded in luke 20 when
[19:22] jesus
[19:22] told holding the same thing this is the
[19:25] spoke
[19:26] of the corner he tried to tell them now
[19:28] peter's
[19:29] telling them that see peter's telling
[19:32] them that here
[19:33] peter's telling him this is that song
[19:36] which you
[19:37] builders have said not well what's he
[19:40] talking about
[19:42] what what are these builders of
[19:45] what do these people build oh
[19:48] what is it that they're in control of
[19:50] building
[19:51] well they're supposed to be the
[19:52] religious leaders
[19:54] they're supposed to be the people that's
[19:56] in charge of these people's spiritual
[19:58] welfare
[19:59] they're supposed to be the ones to be
[20:00] returned to the church the symbols
[20:03] they're in charge of delivering to those
[20:05] people the truth of god
[20:07] the messiah the the
[20:10] jehovah elohim they're in charge of the
[20:14] spiritual welfare of those people
[20:16] they're supposed to be the ones that are
[20:18] building this church
[20:20] that they're building this people up to
[20:23] the place that they're supposed to be
[20:25] uh uh believing in god well they're
[20:28] that's
[20:28] they're the ones that are the builders
[20:31] of that
[20:32] see the builders of that church you look
[20:35] at
[20:35] churches today you've got denominations
[20:39] you've got ministers pastors you've got
[20:42] money flowing all around the world for
[20:44] religious purposes
[20:46] just because they're considered still in
[20:48] this country a non-profit organization
[20:50] is tax deductible
[20:52] so of course they can deduct
[20:55] their taxes but anyway they're supposed
[20:59] to be
[20:59] the builders they're supposed to be the
[21:02] one the religious
[21:03] leaders that people look up to that it's
[21:06] building this body
[21:08] see this body is being built
[21:11] it is a body that comes together
[21:29] see of that body they're the builders of
[21:32] that
[21:32] church that's coming together see
[21:35] and he said you have taken the stone
[21:39] the cornerstone of that building
[21:42] and
[22:08] so look at this for a moment it's him
[22:12] being the head of the corner
[22:13] that puts him perfectly in line with
[22:16] being the alpha
[22:17] and omega if he puts him perfectly in
[22:20] line with the
[22:21] author and the finisher it puts him
[22:24] perfectly in line with being the first
[22:26] and the last he was the beginning
[22:30] he is the end he is the everything
[22:33] from beginning to end so he is alpha
[22:38] he's not only the head that he's coming
[22:40] to tap the bride
[22:42] he is also the foundation of the corner
[22:46] he is the course on the head of the
[22:48] court he's at the beginning
[22:51] he's the alpha and the omega he's the
[22:54] beginning
[22:55] foundation cornerstone and the head
[22:59] we're a part of that because we're a
[23:01] part of the body
[23:03] because we are the body we are the body
[23:05] i'm a part of the body
[23:34] to them as being builders of that
[23:38] of that body of that church
[23:41] he relates to them as being the builders
[23:44] who said that saw
[23:45] it not but that stone has not become the
[23:48] corner
[23:48] the hand of the corner of that building
[23:52] which is the body his body his
[23:55] spiritual body he's a spiritual head
[23:59] in the preeminence of all things
[24:03] primarily
[24:04] as we care and looking to the head of
[24:06] this body
[24:08] they said not but regardless of
[24:10] themselves
[24:12] he still become head of corner he still
[24:14] become head of the body
[24:16] because he is
[24:27] regardless of what these builders do
[24:30] regardless of what they preach or say
[24:32] or promote or propagate whatever church
[24:35] religion
[24:36] doesn't matter jesus is still the head
[24:39] of the body
[24:40] he is still the head of the corner
[24:42] regardless of what those people have
[24:44] done
[24:57] neither is their salvation being any
[24:59] other
[25:01] for there is none other name under
[25:04] heaven given
[25:05] among men whereby we must be saved the
[25:08] name of jesus christ
[25:26] that it's built
[25:28] [Music]
[25:41] of this church the body built
[25:44] inspiration this country oddly enough
[25:48] if you look at it and some of you may
[25:50] remember back
[25:51] uh years ago brother greene gave
[26:01] but if you notice even on the very
[26:04] dollar field
[26:05] of the united states my brother blew
[26:08] these
[26:37] supposed to be you see the
[26:39] representation of that in the body
[26:41] because this was the christian nation
[26:43] this nation was founded as a christian
[26:45] nation
[26:46] and all the principles of the scripture
[26:49] and a freedom of religion not freedom
[26:52] from religion but freedom of religion in
[26:54] other words they wanted us to be able to
[26:56] serve and live and
[26:57] uh serve god the way that we wanted to
[26:59] according to our dictates in the bible
[27:01] that's why the things are written on the
[27:03] song the way they are on the buildings
[27:04] of washington
[27:14] this pyramid was built this is the body
[27:17] see that
[27:45] looking over our country but notice the
[27:48] detachment
[27:49] they also had very prophetic really
[27:53] you notice the detachment here the cast
[27:57] had not come to cap the body
[28:00] because it's separate you notice this
[28:03] nation
[28:04] where it is at today that nation
[28:07] rejected this nation the builders
[28:10] rejected that capstone they rejected it
[28:15] and now they've done without it and
[28:17] there's no connection here between the
[28:18] body and the head
[28:19] this body that we consider the united
[28:22] states of america
[28:23] detached from the head which was jesus
[28:26] christ
[28:27] supposed to be god the all-seeing eye it
[28:29] is detached
[28:31] it's not joined together it's not one
[28:33] entity it's not one unity
[28:35] and you see what happens because it's
[28:37] detached we talked about last week i
[28:40] made a mention because i saw it
[28:41] somewhere and somebody or both
[28:44] you know years ago they took out prayer
[28:45] and bible in schools
[28:47] and they wondered then 50 60 70 80 years
[28:49] ago whenever it happened
[28:51] what would ever come of our children
[28:53] what's going to come of our nation now
[28:54] that we've taken
[28:55] prayer in the bible out of schools well
[28:58] you can look around and you know what
[28:59] the results are
[29:00] we can see what the results are now the
[29:03] capstone
[29:04] detached from the body has never come to
[29:07] cap
[29:08] amen however that capstone
[29:12] that that that come is
[29:15] become the head of the corner of the
[29:18] body
[29:19] regardless of what these builders
[29:22] did regardless of what these builders
[29:25] said regardless of the rejection
[29:28] from that of god this bright body
[29:32] has now accepted him and his comments
[29:36] as him to cap her to be one
[29:40] unit together because she's not two
[29:41] units she is one
[29:43] it's just like when the reference here
[29:46] again that we have the scripture
[29:48] lord willing we might get to ephesians 5
[29:50] maybe next week
[29:52] of the wife and the and the bridegroom
[29:54] the bride and the bridegroom the husband
[29:56] and wife
[29:57] the bride and christ coming together
[29:58] when they come together they're one
[30:00] they're one together he comes he caps
[30:03] that body
[30:03] we are one we're one with him we come
[30:06] from him
[30:07] we go to him that's the preeminence that
[30:09] he has
[30:10] the the the stone that the builders
[30:13] rejected
[30:14] the stone today that they continued the
[30:18] builders of this christian or this this
[30:21] religious foundation
[30:23] is supposed to be built on was a
[30:25] christian today
[30:26] was was supposed to be founded on has
[30:29] been rejected
[30:31] and the capstone has not come upon them
[30:35] he is not going to come upon them he's
[30:37] coming upon his bride
[30:40] he come to save his people not everybody
[30:43] his people that capstone has come to cap
[30:46] her
[30:46] off because she has become him
[30:49] she is now uh flesh of his flesh bone of
[30:52] his bone life of his life spirit of his
[30:54] spirit
[30:55] that head is coming intelligence the
[30:58] word
[30:59] the prophetic gift the all-seeing eye
[31:02] it is it is shining forth
[31:05] through the body of jesus christ because
[31:08] we
[31:08] are that one to be the full expression
[31:11] of jesus christ
[31:12] for this last day we are the ones that
[31:15] are expressing him and showing him as
[31:18] the same
[31:18] yesterday today and forever through us
[31:22] he shines forth because that's who we
[31:24] are in him
[31:25] the builders rejected him
[31:28] but the bride receives him because
[31:31] he is her all in all but now looking
[31:34] look at ephesians chapter two
[31:42] let's see if i can get it here ephesians
[31:44] chapter two we're gonna
[31:46] i'm gonna bring a couple of scriptures
[31:48] in here
[31:49] now i wanna read ephesians chapter two
[31:51] and then go to one specific part of
[31:53] ephesians chapter two and then one more
[31:56] scripture we'll probably wrap this up
[31:58] but now look at this it looks like the
[31:59] video is doing better too by the way so
[32:01] thankful for that uh some of this could
[32:03] have been cause my phone started running
[32:05] out of internet
[32:05] hotspot uh so i'm having to use sonia's
[32:08] today so
[32:09] but it looks like it's doing better
[32:11] anyway ephesians chapter two
[32:13] let's go to uh um start with verse
[32:16] 14. ephesians chapter two verse 14.
[32:20] let's read this for he is our peace
[32:24] jesus is our peace who had broken
[32:27] uh who had excuse me he is our peace who
[32:30] has made both
[32:31] one and hath broken down the middle wall
[32:34] our partition
[32:35] between us having abolished in his flesh
[32:39] in his flesh the enmity the division the
[32:42] hatred the enemy
[32:44] uh even the law of commandments
[32:47] contained in
[32:48] ordinances for to make in himself
[32:52] of twain one new man so making peace
[32:56] and that he might reconcile both unto
[32:59] god
[33:00] where both unto god in
[33:03] one body what body is that
[33:06] jesus christ where did the bride come
[33:08] from his body
[33:10] amen in one body by the cross where was
[33:14] it done
[33:15] at calvary on the cross amen
[33:18] in one body by the cross having slain
[33:22] the enemy the enmity thereby
[33:26] we say enemy the enemy the evil the
[33:29] wickedness the
[33:30] division thereby and
[33:33] came and preached peace to you
[33:36] which were afar off into them that were
[33:39] nine
[33:40] for through him we both have access
[33:44] by one spirit his spirit unto the father
[33:48] now therefore we are no more strangers
[33:50] and foreigners but fellow citizens
[33:52] with the saints and of them of the
[33:53] household of god and are
[33:55] built look here now and are built
[33:58] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[34:01] prophets
[34:02] jesus christ himself being the
[34:06] chief cornerstone amen being the chief
[34:10] cornerstone which we've already
[34:11] described looked at peter saying
[34:14] jesus said in saint luke 7 2017
[34:18] david psalms 118
[34:21] he is that cornerstone he is the alpha
[34:24] and omega he is the foundation he is the
[34:27] head
[34:28] he is the begin author and the finisher
[34:32] praise the lord that being the chief
[34:35] cornerstone
[34:36] in whom all the building all the
[34:39] building
[34:39] what is that building we are we are that
[34:42] bride we are that
[34:43] figurative adjective bride body
[34:47] many member body remember once
[34:50] god the fullness of the godhead dwelt in
[34:53] one person jesus christ
[34:55] jesus said i must needs uh to go i got
[34:58] to go away
[34:59] and his disciples were distraught they
[35:01] didn't wanted to leave i don't blame him
[35:03] i wouldn't want him to either
[35:04] but he said i must go because if i don't
[35:07] go all you've got is me hearing the
[35:08] flesh with you
[35:09] but if i go away i'll send the comforter
[35:11] the holy spirit
[35:12] me my life the spirit will come and not
[35:15] just be with you
[35:17] but be in you and it won't just be in
[35:19] you
[35:20] few people here it'll be in the
[35:22] multitudes
[35:24] in millions down through the generations
[35:26] down to the church ages there'll be
[35:28] millions that my spirit will go
[35:30] into and then i can have the preeminence
[35:33] in each one of those people because my
[35:36] life will be in them
[35:37] my spirit will be in them i must go away
[35:41] so that i can come back in whom that
[35:43] building now
[35:45] the bride building is fitly framed
[35:48] together
[35:50] groweth unto a holy temple in the lord
[35:53] in whom he also are building together
[35:55] for inhabitation of god through the
[35:58] spirit
[35:59] the habitation of god through the spirit
[36:02] oh praise the lord i just beautiful
[36:05] isn't it
[36:05] it's just just so beautiful but frame
[36:08] together look at this real quick now
[36:09] frame together groweth unto the holy
[36:13] temple in the lord this building so
[36:16] fitly joined together you remember what
[36:18] brother branham described it as
[36:20] remember how brother brown typed it
[36:22] brother adam typed it at the
[36:24] as those pyramids that were built uh
[36:27] he had said by enoch that were
[36:31] so intelligent and so perfectly hewn
[36:34] those
[36:35] stones that made that pyramid was so
[36:38] perfectly hewn
[36:39] that you can't run a razor blade between
[36:42] the two stones
[36:43] now understand something each stone is
[36:46] separate in itself
[36:48] each stone is an individual stone it's
[36:51] not one stone it's two stones
[36:53] but they become so fitly
[36:56] building comes so fitly joined together
[36:59] now help us understand god this is us
[37:02] this is the bride this bride
[37:06] building body should be so fitly joined
[37:10] together
[37:11] that you could not take a razor blade
[37:14] and separate between the two praise the
[37:17] lord
[37:18] now satan tries to do it all the time
[37:21] satan will continually try to bring
[37:23] division and hatred and
[37:25] he'll try to take a razor blade and
[37:27] slice between you and your brother and
[37:29] you and your sister all the time
[37:31] but that body is so fitly joined
[37:34] together
[37:35] because christ came and chewed it so
[37:38] perfect
[37:39] each stone is so perfectly hewned out
[37:43] now who's who's a stone i am a stone
[37:46] you're a stone we're so perfectly humed
[37:50] by god
[37:51] gotten to the place of that of that
[37:53] position of maturity
[37:56] of perfection as he said in matthew 5 48
[37:59] perfection which is maturity a place or
[38:02] a level of
[38:03] shooting out where god has taken all the
[38:06] things away from us that don't belong to
[38:08] us
[38:08] all the things that that are ungodly and
[38:11] all the things that we shouldn't be
[38:12] tagged on or hanging on
[38:13] god takes and cues this body down
[38:17] he takes his word to do it and that word
[38:20] chops those
[38:21] places off and thinly tunes that body
[38:24] together so that
[38:26] it's so much him now this
[38:29] body this brightest is so much become
[38:31] him now
[38:32] we have so much becoming him now with
[38:34] that head on the body
[38:36] you can't run a razor blade between
[38:38] brother and sister
[38:40] you shouldn't if there's some there
[38:43] razor bleeding there's there's there's a
[38:44] problem somewhere
[38:46] but this bride now i'm not talking about
[38:48] pretenders or make believers or
[38:50] i'm talking about true bride are going
[38:52] to be so hewn together
[38:54] you can't even run a razor blade between
[38:56] them that's that
[38:58] building that's that building that is so
[39:01] fitly joined together he has here
[39:04] in whom all the building fitly framed
[39:07] together
[39:09] grows into that holy temple of the lord
[39:13] which we are the temple of the holy
[39:15] ghost
[39:16] now look and and real quick the 20th
[39:19] verse again
[39:20] i i'm going to close here give me
[39:21] another 10 minutes or so
[39:23] but look here in the 20th verse
[39:26] and are built now remember what peter
[39:30] told them
[39:31] uh there after healing the healing the
[39:34] healing of the impotent man
[39:36] as the impotent man got healed what did
[39:38] he tell them he said you builders
[39:41] amen and we've we've clarified that
[39:44] builder now those who those builders are
[39:47] and we all are amen part of it building
[39:50] this church
[39:51] uh you're a part of that building you're
[39:54] a part of the builder of that building
[39:56] if you go witness to people and bring
[39:58] people to church bring people to christ
[40:00] that's building that body see the
[40:03] ministers come forth and
[40:04] the the right ministers preach that
[40:06] gospel the message of the hour and
[40:08] that that helps bring that building up
[40:10] see builds that building up
[40:12] but now you see and are built
[40:16] upon the foundation apostles and
[40:18] prophets so we are built
[40:20] there's that built of the building that
[40:23] was built up well where did that
[40:24] building come from
[40:26] that building takes us right back
[40:30] to the place that jesus was describing
[40:34] before
[40:36] which we're going to read in matthew
[40:37] that brings us to our actual
[40:39] title our message title
[40:43] the title that brother branham gave
[40:45] christ the mystery god revealed
[40:46] our title that we've been titling this
[40:48] series of the mysteries of god
[40:50] in christ what is it it brings us right
[40:54] around
[40:55] back to being built on that foundation
[40:59] well look matthew chapter 16
[41:03] look at this real quick matthew chapter
[41:05] 16
[41:06] um verse 17 we'll start there
[41:13] amen matthew 16 17
[41:17] and jesus approaching his disciples
[41:21] answered and said unto him uh let's
[41:24] let's go up higher than that
[41:25] let's let's just read the story 13th
[41:28] first
[41:28] let's start there when jesus came into
[41:31] the coast of caesarea philippi
[41:33] he asked his disciples saying who do men
[41:35] say that i the son of man am
[41:37] and they said some say that thou art
[41:40] john the baptist
[41:41] some elias others jeremiah's or one of
[41:44] the prophets
[41:46] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[41:49] that i am so he's wanting to get very
[41:51] personal with them here
[41:53] he said who do men say i the son of man
[41:56] am and they say well some says this
[42:00] i heard this guy over here say that i
[42:02] heard this
[42:03] rabbi say this about you i heard this
[42:05] group of people talk about you and
[42:07] calling you this at the other
[42:09] and then he gets personal with him and
[42:10] he says okay
[42:12] but who do you who do you i'm standing
[42:15] before you
[42:16] the ones i have handpicked and chosen
[42:19] who do you
[42:19] say that i am
[42:23] in simon peter 16 first answer and said
[42:26] thou
[42:26] art the christ the son of the living god
[42:30] amen what was peter's revelation
[42:35] peter's revelation was the understanding
[42:38] that jesus wasn't the son of joseph or
[42:40] mary
[42:42] he wasn't just come as some second
[42:44] person in the godhead
[42:46] he wasn't just uh a part of a trinity or
[42:50] something
[42:50] but that he was literally the son of god
[42:54] god almighty in flesh the fulfillment of
[42:58] isaiah 9 who would be the
[43:01] almighty god the everlasting father
[43:06] and jesus answered and said unto him
[43:08] blessed art thou
[43:10] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[43:12] not revealed this you didn't learn it in
[43:14] seminary
[43:15] you didn't get it from some school of
[43:16] prophets you didn't get prophesied
[43:19] there's no
[43:20] you didn't get it from any any any flesh
[43:22] and blood
[43:23] but my father which is in heaven
[43:27] this comes a direct revelation from god
[43:30] almighty
[43:31] to you of who jesus is
[43:34] and then he says and i say unto thee
[43:37] that thou art peter and upon
[43:40] this rock i will build my church and the
[43:43] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[43:45] it
[43:46] upon what rock now
[43:49] the catholic church says it's the church
[43:51] is
[43:52] built on remember we're in the theme of
[43:55] builders and building they believe that
[43:58] it was built on peter
[44:00] they said that peter was the first pope
[44:04] so that peter was the one that this
[44:06] foundation was going to be
[44:07] built on because jesus said
[44:10] upon this thou art peter and upon this
[44:13] rock
[44:14] not peter he said this rock what was
[44:17] this rock
[44:19] that the the revelation
[44:22] of who jesus christ is now peter
[44:25] there's nothing that's going to be built
[44:27] on peter peter was just a man
[44:29] but it had to be built on something that
[44:32] was going to hold of a solid foundation
[44:35] i mean look if it was built on peter not
[44:37] long after this peter was cussing
[44:39] yelling and screaming at little kids and
[44:41] telling him he was denying jesus
[44:43] left him right chair running for his
[44:46] life that's
[44:46] what the church was getting upon no
[44:50] no he said this she read it i say unto
[44:53] thee
[44:53] thou art peter and upon this rock i will
[44:56] build my church
[44:58] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[45:00] against it so
[45:01] if it's not built on the foundation of
[45:04] who jesus christ is
[45:06] as god himself not again a trinity or
[45:09] the second third person or no not just
[45:12] some good prophet some good man no
[45:14] god himself that foundation
[45:18] author and finisher that foundation
[45:21] built upon the revelation of who jesus
[45:24] christ
[45:25] is in containing in that all the
[45:28] mysteries
[45:30] that were to be made known and revealed
[45:33] in this last day
[45:34] through the last angel messenger through
[45:36] the prophets down through the ages
[45:38] remember what just brother brown
[45:39] this is slowly unfolding mysteries down
[45:42] through the generations in time
[45:44] each person each prophet each reformer
[45:47] saw their day saw their time and gave
[45:49] what they had for that day
[45:51] you had justification in luther you had
[45:53] sanctification in wesley you had the
[45:55] restoration
[45:56] gifts and and pentecost and and the
[45:59] carrier the shock
[46:00] bringing forth the wheat so that the
[46:02] wheat could come forth
[46:03] and shine as the original not the shell
[46:07] the shop's not the original the blade
[46:09] apostle is not the original
[46:10] only the seed is of the original now
[46:13] each one of them is a part of that plant
[46:15] amen understand but they are not the
[46:18] seed
[46:19] so those mysteries that were to be
[46:22] revealed
[46:24] come by the building of this foundation
[46:27] this church this bride being built
[46:30] upon the foundation of the revelation
[46:33] of who jesus christ is this bride body
[46:38] is now built on the revelation of who
[46:42] jesus
[46:42] is now if there's any other church i'm
[46:45] not knocking anybody not knocking any
[46:47] ministers not knocking any churches
[46:49] but if there's any churches any
[46:51] ministers pastors
[46:53] anything else any other denomination or
[46:55] any other type of religion
[46:57] that's built on anything else other than
[47:00] the fact that who
[47:01] jesus christ is by revelation god
[47:04] almighty and flesh
[47:07] satan can prevail over that
[47:11] cannot prevail over this building that's
[47:14] built on the foundation of who he is
[47:16] cannot amen satan cannot prevail
[47:21] can he come against oh absolutely we
[47:23] feel that coming against quite often
[47:25] don't we
[47:26] but he can't prevail the gates of
[47:29] hell shall not prevail understand the
[47:33] difference
[47:34] he can come against absolutely but he
[47:36] will not prevail
[47:38] against this body that is built upon
[47:41] that revelation
[47:43] he cannot do it amen
[47:46] thou art peter upon this rock i will
[47:48] build my church
[47:50] i will build my church god said
[47:53] he would build it not a man
[47:57] not a nomination not a
[48:00] church entity denomination
[48:06] hierarchy he would build it
[48:10] how is he building it how is
[48:13] jesus christ he said i will build it
[48:16] i will build it how is he building it
[48:20] he's building his own church by living
[48:23] in
[48:24] us by having the preeminence
[48:27] in us by his preeminence in our lives
[48:31] and that preeminence shining forth
[48:34] through us all it's doing is bringing
[48:37] that
[48:37] building into the perfection of that
[48:40] capstone
[48:41] where it's supposed to be the buildings
[48:44] that the builders rejected the stone
[48:47] that that
[48:48] satan can prevail over that in fact
[48:52] pardon me but he already has satan
[48:54] already has control of the religious
[48:55] world period this is satan's eat
[48:57] but he does not and has not and cannot
[49:00] get control
[49:01] over this bride and over that body that
[49:04] was built on the foundation
[49:06] of who jesus christ is and by the
[49:10] message of the hour through brother
[49:11] brown
[49:12] we realize he can see by revelation
[49:16] who he is he introduced him
[49:20] to a bride he didn't introduce him to
[49:22] himself he didn't point to himself
[49:24] he pointed us to christ
[49:27] and he pointed us to a living christ
[49:30] not a dead one not a history historical
[49:33] one
[49:33] but a living christ that this body can
[49:36] see
[49:37] who that is that through us
[49:40] having his preeminence in us
[49:44] build this church
[49:48] that's how he christ i will build
[49:51] my church as the head of the corner
[49:55] as the author and the finisher as the
[49:58] alpha
[49:59] and omega he will finish
[50:02] and then he laid into the laps of peter
[50:05] and of course
[50:06] figuratively into the lap of this bride
[50:08] i will give to thee the keys of the
[50:10] kingdom of heaven praise the lord and
[50:12] whatsoever thou shalt find on earth
[50:14] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou
[50:15] shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
[50:17] heaven you don't think god doesn't honor
[50:19] that to this very day
[50:22] he didn't honor that just in peter that
[50:24] transformation of that from here
[50:27] to us is complete from ear to the bride
[50:31] it's finished preeminence of christ
[50:34] in that body the preeminence of that
[50:37] head
[50:37] that capstone coming down on the bride
[50:41] and that capstone love love remember
[50:44] it's love
[50:46] having the preeminence in that body oh
[50:48] praise the lord
[50:50] that's god having his preeminence in us
[50:53] he has built that
[50:54] church on that he has built that church
[50:57] on who he
[50:58] is praise the lord i will build my
[51:01] church and the gates of hell
[51:03] shall not prevail against it look friend
[51:06] it'll continue and this satan zenos
[51:09] continue to press and he'll do
[51:11] everything he can to try to come against
[51:13] you
[51:13] but he cannot listen to me
[51:16] he cannot prevail over you
[51:20] he cannot prevail over this bride
[51:24] over you as a part of that bride he
[51:27] cannot
[51:27] prevail or win this war
[51:31] impossible because we're built on that
[51:33] foundation
[51:35] amen the foundation that the other
[51:37] builders reject
[51:39] that the builders that this country is
[51:41] rejected and those builders around the
[51:43] world today
[51:44] they reject it doesn't matter he's
[51:46] building his own church
[51:48] he's building his own church with that
[51:50] revelation as the cornerstone
[51:52] and he's building it by having the
[51:53] preeminence in you and i
[51:56] praise the lord amen that's wonderful
