fluids were leaking and very little power but I was able to drive it down to McGee and Oracle to the mechanic uh I was panicked because I had lost my bank card so I had no way of paying them and I

something come like last week we talked about first thing we want to do is just give up bail out no I can't like I can't do this I'm going to do something else I'm gonna go somewhere else I'm gonna give up I'm going to change the lord always has a purpose and a reason for everything he does for us amen everything God sends us through amen it's not the time to quit not the time to feel defeat amen it's the time to gird our ones and stand upon the promise of God's word amen he's given us victory in his name praise the Lord amen before we change the order of the service anybody else have uh something on your heart testimony or something sister Norma help you real quick um my dad and um his two sisters were but anyways I've been praying for their salvation for the longest time and my dad has and my aunt passed and um her step sister told me she wanted a lamp for my dad I gave her that and then my Aunt Berta um she had all that an audible lamp the same way as my dad's and she got that and then my last Aunt here that just passed away and um perhaps that you took her home before she became very ill that's when it had her husband passed away and she saw a lamp she said oh I like that oil lamp she said what's my name is oh there's three oil lamps three is God's Perfection I will tell you the truth that I was watching this and that was a confirmation to me because I was talking in the with my earphones to my aunt the last of the stepsisters that um you know it's three lamps isn't that funny to learn from my steps and that was the confirmation to me this morning and everything amen you know that is good praise the Lord you know God answers our prayer we may not see yes and my aunt Anne and they were all Catholic and she's got out of there amen amen praise the Lord amen amen yes praise the Lord there's one thing that God is extremely well there's everything God's extremely good at one thing that comes to my mind God it's very very long-suffering and patient we want everything right now Lord I want them to say right this second and God said be patient I've got it under control that's the worst thing for us too it's hard for us to wait we want to see results right now and God says you know that Mountain's being moved it might be a grain of sand at a time but it's being moved praise the Lord he is never in a hurry amen anybody else uh I'm sure there are times and my brothers and sisters my faith they probably feel like I did this morning I I sometimes think about Lord why uh what can I do to you what is my calling uh I don't seem to be standing out or anything you know I don't have a forceful calling or something like that but I can do that I you know so there's a gentleman that lives down the street from us we live on a dirt road every Sunday morning this gentleman is sitting out of his yard and we wave at it as we go by and he knows where we're going well he was supposed to pass away a couple months ago years years and years ago wow and he looks so strong and healthy now you know and um if that's all I can do is go down the street and somebody know where I'm going yeah I can do that Lord amen amen I'm just thankful that he showed me that this morning yes amen he has to acknowledge yeah [Music] amen absolutely thank God for that Revelation like that but said everyone has a gift of some kind he said you may only use that gift one time in your entire life but everything else leads up to that and after that God may use and we always major on the ministry and uh or or singing and uh or speaking in tongues or prophecy or something but you know the gift of helps and government all those are just as important guy and like I said program said you male movies at one time in your entire life they just want to be one time amen I I still struggle to understand how it says good singers could come out of two people that couldn't carry a two in a tin bucket but I'm thankful that they got the gift anyway that's that's to make the most important thing to me I'm thankful the Lord is blessed but you know just something simple amen something simple that's all it has to be is to trust God live for him you know I've had I had a brother tell me one time several times I still don't know what I'm supposed to do I still don't know what my college I still don't know this that and the other and I said brother if you don't know what by now you just you're not going to know it because this was a brother that was very helpful it's always encouraging people he was always open in his home for people he was always giving people money he was always he was there to help people all the time if a visitor came into a church he would take him to lunch you're the first one to go to him hey I'm so and so uh how about I take you to lunch you got a place to stay and things like that and he doesn't know what his call is like how could you not but it but it's okay God knows and uh we just give our lives to him and he takes care of it the rest of the way so amen that's wonderful there's no way that man can acknowledge God and you're going to church every time anyone else not let's just stand to our feet if we could get to the word of God here I'm going to try to piggyback on last week if you can turn to uh Jude I want to go to the book of Jude amen and read a couple of verses of scripture out of here again to try to kind of piggyback from last week I want to talk about faith again or continue on faith uh with the service today and uh Jude we're going to read verses three and four Jude verses three and four never read Jude it's sort of there's no chapters just one chapter but it's a tremendously filled book amen a lot of wonderful nuggets in Jude yes um but I'm just going to read verses three and four for a a short topic today and just trust the Lord bless it let's just fire our heads though before we read the word Lord Jesus we're very thankful father again to be here lord of the testimonies the songs that were sung the spirit that was felt and Lord knowing that you are here God doing me exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think we thank you Lord for this place thank you for these people Lord bless and help those who were able to come for whatever reason God just commit them to you Lord in the prayer request that was mentioned and Lord we just believe that you are the author and finisher of our faith Lord and you are in control of everything and you're working everything out together for our good because we love you Lord we thank you for this service for this time for all that you've done through it for us through the week Lord and blessing us and bringing us here Lord may you just have your way Lord in this service now as we commit it to you we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and honor and praise for all that is said and done Lord we just thank you God for this word for a prophet for the revelation of this word to come into our hearts Lord to continue to bless us and to press us forward Lord into this battle that we're in Lord Lord Brother Tom mentioned about going through a mud puddle and not getting Mud On You Lord and it's just understanding in this world of what we go through and continuing to press this battle and continuing to press forward towards the mark of the high calling in you Lord Jesus and gorgeous service today is just a part of that and Lord as we've come I pray that your Holy Spirit once again would bless us and to move and with power and demonstration again Lord through the ministering of your word speak to us now Lord as we commit it to you anoint hearing speaker alike that what you'd have to be accomplished in this service today will be done as we commit it to you and ask your blessings upon it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen book of Jude I'll read the first uh we'll read the verses three and four beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ you could be seated if you like amen we know that is uh uh as people even would call the name of Jesus they still deny him even though they call on him or mention his name you say how is it possible that a person that calls on the name of Jesus would deny him well same way that Satan has called on Jesus and still denies him the only way to deny Jesus or the only way to receive Jesus I should say is to receive his word to receive his word is to obey his word to obey his word we have to have faith in his word the only way to have faith in his word is that we have faith from God to know that what this word says is God's unfailable word voice speaking to us and we know that we can be established and and steadfast in the word knowing that we're an obedient to Jesus Christ how do people deny Christ by denying his word how do they deny the word they don't have faith in the word how did Eve how did Eve deny the word because she didn't have faith in the word when something different came along she went away from the word to accept a lie based on one thing and that was the serpents through Satan through the serpents message to her that what God Said would not happen but that if you did what I said something greater would happen to you and that your eyes would come open you'd know what's good and evil and you be as God's and things and she denied God's word to receive a different word Satan's word and the only way to deny Christ is to receive something other than God's infallible uh uh word his his voice the word of God the revealed word of God to to deny the revealed word that we have for this day is to reject Jesus Christ amen to reject the word that Luther brought for Luther's day was to reject Christ you say but Luther didn't preach what brother random priests it wasn't his time was it his calling it wasn't for that age for that generation for those people but when those people believed what God brought through that man for that time they are just as much bright as you are but you have denied what he said was to reject the word how did that happen because people came in well the Bible specifically says men so will say men crept in and it's and you look at the degradation of society and I know brother Brown said you know the conditions the church look at the condition of the women but that only came because of the degradation of the man the man was the one that was the head the man was the one that was in charge the man's the one that forgive me blew it so you can look at the other side all you want but I look at the man who was had the position to take control over it and again I just used these true words he blew it amen so men come in crept in now how do they creep in they creep in by Looking Like You by sounding like you by saying the same things by looking the same way by singing the same songs but sitting next to you in the same church by getting involved in the same programs and everything else that's how they creep in otherwise if they don't do that how do they creep in you you you can't creep in unawares unless it's something that comes in looking exactly like the original looking exactly like the way that the scripture says or sounding the same way or acting the same way that's the only reason they can creep in unawares and they've crept in to do one thing the same thing that the serpent crept in to the Garden of Eden to defile Eve by it's the same way that they that they are defiled today by having relation to someone other than Jesus Christ who word to have relation to a defiled man-made uh uh word is is is is is adultery to God it's leaving the pure word of God so Judas giving an exhortation here he's saying that I'm I'm telling you that let me read it again I gave all diligence to write about the common salvation amen the common salvation it is nameful for me to write to you and exhort you exhort you that you earnestly contend for the Faith with which was once delivered earnestly contend for the faith what does that mean what does it mean to earnestly contend will simply put Earnest means to be Earnest is to be serious in your intention purpose or effort do earnestly means that you're serious about something you you you hold a zealousness about you that that brings you into a condition where you're not playing Church you're not putting on this isn't a facade there's no pretension here there's nothing pretend this is all real this is all true this is for my heart serious before God I'm not coming to church just to see what other people look like wearing who else is going to be there I'm not doing this just to try to put on a show to make other people think that I'm a Christian I do this because I'm zealous because I'm serious because I'm Earnest in what I believe what I'm doing is because of the earnest earnesty of my heart that I love the Lord serious in intention purpose effort an intense conviction your conviction is something that drives you your conviction is something that brings you from from point A to point B a conviction is something that that nobody should be able to dissuade you from you're going to press towards that Mark regardless of what anybody else or anything else or anywhere else nothing is going to stop me amen Paul said height death uh things present things to come Nothing's Gonna separate me from the love of God that's that is an earnestness that is a contention a conviction amen when you have a conviction that's something nobody can take away from you because it's something that you are determined to do you're Earnest in your in your drive to do this and your earnesty here is to contend you're going to condemn now what does contend mean well um brother random uh I believe talked about uh uh overcoming and he used boxing you know brother random would use boxing a few times as uh sort of as an allegory it was something that uh he used to do as a young man and he he still said he even enjoyed the sport of boxing although he said it had changed so much because Man became Guinea and one hit with the hand and his skull would crashing and things that's what he said he said now they wrap feather pillows around their hands and they still can't stand it but he enjoyed the sport of boxing so that was kind of an analogy that he would use and when when when someone has uh the heavyweight champion they had they hold the heavyweight title they are at the top of their profession uh they can't get any higher it's the number one position in that sport than you can attain to is to be the heavyweight champion of the world that was like the number one thing in boxing when I grew up even it was like it was like the top of the top Muhammad Ali he was celebrating still is celebrated to to the nth degree because he was the heavyweight champion of the world but they were people who felt they were just as capable of getting that Championship as he was so what did they do they wanted to get that from him and the only way to get it from him is to contend for it to fight him for it amen now you have something that the devil doesn't necessarily want but he doesn't want you to have it and that's faith in Jesus Christ he doesn't want it he'll never have it but he doesn't want you to have it regardless of whether he wants it or not in fact he would rather you not have it than than anything else so the contention begins to come because God's give you something you know you have something because you're a child of God you had that faith and Satan is going to come and contend for that he's going to fight you for every inch of ground that you gain in Jesus Christ you've had to fight for it you have to fight the devil every inch Satan place with your mind Satan place with your spirit you'll play with the people around you he'll play with your uh a mess with your your children or or your family or your your spouse or relatives whatever it is Satan will do uh your friends or or co-workers or or people that you know around he'll do anything to try to steal that Faith away from you that's why Jude said that you must earnestly contend it can't be a passing fancy friend there can be no say to no now God knows if you play in church but Satan does too Satan knows if you're pretentious Satan knows if you're just putting on a facade he knows that amen and that's exactly where he's going to hit you it's that place that you're weak is because you're just putting on church or pretending he's going to contend for that he's going to try to take it from you so what do we do well when Joe Frazier or George Foreman came up and challenged Muhammad Ali he didn't just stand there and let those guys beat him to a pulp he fought back he wanted to keep that prize he wanted to hold on to that Championship so he didn't just let those guys beat him up he fought back he beat him back don't just stand there and let the devil strip you of everything that he's trying to keep you from having you fight back you take back what belongs to you in fact don't even let him get it don't even let it say get I hear those songs all the time I'm going to take back what the devil stole don't let the devil take anything from you in the first place you should never have to take anything back contend fight for it fight for it Jude said earnestly content for what the faith content is to strive in rivalry rivalry or against difficulties to strive or to fight against opposing factions or the enemy to contend amen it's not like you're trying to necessarily pick a fight although if it's the devil I'm game but he's trying to take it from you so what do we do we take the fight to him how do you fight him every time you pick up your Bible and you read every time you get down and pray however you pray wherever you pray whenever it is if you're in your car you're just standing around whatever you Jesus stood in the middle of a crowd one day and looked up and said Lord and and started praying standing in the middle of a crowd doesn't matter where you're at right doesn't matter whether you're kneeling standing whatever you're doing setting the Bible says to pray without Cece that's contending every time you do that it's a black eye of the devil you take the fight to him every time you come to church every time you help somebody every time you you do something that's going to enhance the kingdom of God or or help bless somebody's life or to help make a difference in the world to do something good amen every time you do something Godly you're you're taking the fight to the devil but the devil is there to strip it from you to take it from you and say and friends let me tell you Satan is winning the battle in this world amen he's winning the battle in this world you know why because this world belongs to him this world Cosmos belongs to the devil but let's look and talk about this just for a moment on on this true Faith before I get to a couple of points that I want to say uh Romans chapter 10 amen Romans chapter 10. we'll begin with verse 14. it's all a very familiar scripture to us but when you look around and we spent a we spent a quite a few services on our new beginning and and going through teaching that but it comes to time Saints where I I personally uh as Pastor feel compelled to uh to bring something to encourage our faith I know personally it helps me I know personally it strengthens me when the Lord begins to speak to me or speak to me through his word or through a message I'm listening to about faith and if you listen to the messages the tapes as much as I do you'll hear Brother Brown talk about faith and pretty much every single tape right every service of course when he has prayer lines and all that's the main focus the main focus of a prayer line service is Faith of course but uh but even in the teaching services and things it all boils around to Faith why faith is the foundation of that statue of a perfect man if you don't have faith you're never going to go anywhere with Christ how can you believe how can you know there's a godliness you believe in him unless you have faith but now look this faith that we're talking about Romans chapter 10 verse 14. how then shall we call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent and as it is written now how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things now I want you to notice something that we're going to separate here and and there's a couple of things I want to talk about that in fact let me just finish reading verse 16. uh but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said uh Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now the first verse that we read here in the last verse we read here bookend everything else that Paul was talking about in this short little statement in in to the Roman Church this small little statement the begin was whosoever called the uh no 14th verse how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed believed and how how do you believe with faith only way to believe something is have faith and how shall they believe in him and who they have not heard that's the word amen faith in the word uh have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher someone ordained to bring by God the pure unadulterated word of God amen and how shall they preach except they be sent you say there's a lot of preachers out there today but what are they doing are they sent because only a preacher he's talking about in this word here is one that is bringing the pure unadulterated word of their hour amen not just somebody that interjects something from a seminary or their own ideas or their own opinions or their own way of seeing or looking at something no is to bring the pure unadulterated word that's the only qualification that a preacher has to know that that that person is bringing God in fact that is the only way to me as I read this the only way that a person a man could be qualified or Quantified or referred to as a preacher somebody I've said this many many times friendly but just because a man has the gift of Gavin is comfortable standing in front of people does not make him a preacher right amen it might make him a decent politician yeah but it won't make him a preacher how is the preacher preach unless he sent a preacher does not other people may there may be people out there who Pastor churches or whatever I don't know that's up to them that's between them and God I'm not thinking of anybody I'm not calling anybody out I just know it exists because the word says it does that's the only reason I know it exists because the word says it exists Jude just told us that it exists so what is a preacher what what quantifies a man in Paul's eyes here in Romans as a preacher someone who delivers and brings to people the pure unadulterated word of God end of story nothing added nothing taken away nothing changed nothing altered it's the pure word of God and God only not man's ideas not man's opinion but what God said that's the only thing that quantifies the preacher so when it says the preacher has to be sent it doesn't mean somebody that's out just preaching their denominations belief or doctrine or whatever no that's not a preacher amen a preacher someone that brings the word pure word of God which book ends now the 17th verse so then Faith come by hearing hearing what the word of God from whom a sent preacher not somebody that's just out preaching whatever they think whatever they want to whatever their Seminary told them to preach no what the word of God the pure unadulterated word of God says that's where faith comes from That's How faith is built that's how Faith grows Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God not hearing somebody's opinion about it but the word of God look now he says how can they be uh and how shall they preach except they be sent it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings and good things but now look what he says in the 16th verse he said but they have not all obeyed the gospel they well who is he just talking about preachers they have not all obeyed the gospel amen and even if it isn't just preachers it would qualify for anybody that doesn't believe the word of God that is not enhanced or or helped blessed by the word of God edified by the word of God then who are these people they have not obeyed the gospel that takes us back to what we just talked about a minute ago oh believing and obeying are two different things amen you say brother nude the Bible says if you believe well Satan believes but he does not obey amen there's a big difference in believing in something and obeying something amen when you obey then that brings you into the category of that faith and one's Faith look now one's Faith the pure Faith now we're going to talk about in the context that Paul's preaching and one's faith that Faith he's talking about has by the word of God has found its place in you has found this place in that individual you must fight for that every single day you must fight because at that moment it's the moment that Satan begins to send his minions out to destroy you to take it from you to do any needs he possibly can he'll use any device he can possibly use say to use the serpent to defale Eve what makes you think Satan isn't using other people to do the same thing amen people around you maybe there's men that's tripped in unawares maybe there's ministering of of something other than the word oh I believe brother Banner meant this you know I'm not you know me I'm not interested in what you think brother Branham meant amen now in context to the word because what brother Branham preached came from this word yes amen and if your interpretation or your definition of what brother random said preached doesn't match up with this word from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 then there's nothing wrong with this and there's nothing wrong with him or that message the problem lies with you or me or whatever it may be amen and there's the contention the contention that Satan comes against that pure belief and Jude says we must earnestly contend for that faith because these have come in and this isn't unprecedented we know this Saints let's go to uh Matthew just for a minute Matthew chapter uh oh well with Matthew chapter 7. two scriptures that I want to share with you Jesus said one and Paul said the other I mean two great authorities be number one Authority obviously Jesus Christ and Paul speaking to us look now Matthew 7 verse 13. enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leaded to destruction and many there be which go therein their act because straight is the gay and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it be aware of false prophets which come to you in sheets clothing there we go jeans clothing what does that mean they come in looking just like you sounding just like acting just like setting maybe maybe and I don't mean here but sitting right next to you amen in sheep's clothing so they look just like you but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits you men gather grapes or Thorns or figs or of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt free bringeth forth corrupt I bringeth forth evil fruit but look it can happen where that comes in like sheep's clothing can look just like sound just alike um if you've got the holy spirit in that and that level of discernment that comes with that Holy Spirit friend is not deceiving to you I I I I have known people I have been around people I have rubbed shoulders ministers that you held in esteem as a colleague is a brother uh and they they sound the part they look the part they play the part everything about you would think that person but there's just something in there that that brings a question mark into your spirit I've done that before do I treat that person any different no I I by God's grace and I I stand before him today I would like to think praying Lord I've never treated anybody that I felt that way differently but on down the road 10 15 20 years later all of a sudden something happens and that person's gone they're preaching something off the word denouncing the message altogether and you know there was something that was in there 20 years ago this in your spirit that just didn't seem right the bride cannot be deceived no no amen she cannot be deceived there can be a time where there might be a going along before they they're before they come to the realization that what they're doing where they're going what they're listening to is not right because they will not be the bride cannot be deceived but remember the serpent Satan to the serpent brought to Eve 99 word amen 99 percent I've had people in come to me I tell them you know I I know this person just be careful I know how they believe well I've I've been going to church here six months and I've never heard him say anything about that I said just I'm just telling you just I know this person personally I know what they believe just be careful that's that's all I can tell you just be careful amen and maybe not long after that or something uh not only is what that person preached gonna be influenced by what they believe about it amen like I've told you many times people uh go to a nominal church or something and and if that's the Nugget they can get then you know that that's that's up to them but I I'd say these nominal churches out here they're they're 95 plus percent trinitarian yeah well I never heard him preach about that doesn't matter every single thing that man is preaching is going to be influenced by his belief that there's three Gods right it has to be yeah and and I say that by experience because I know that whatever the Lord gives me it has to run through this thinking man's filter it has to go through this filter and in this filter it tells me whether it's right wrong whatever this filter says amen and that's what I have to follow and if it's outside of that then then it can't be right and that's when you begin to contend and say when I do that when I personally preach something I look through the eyes the lens of the true godhead whatever your belief is that's what you believe oh that's that's that's going to be Seasons with what their belief is I've said that before and you know that let's go to Paul because my time's getting away uh Paul Acts chapter 20. there's no law Acts chapter 20. we just read Matthew 7 uh where Jesus said that to beware of false prophets that come in sheep's clothing look what Paul says in Acts chapter 20. Acts chapter 20 verse 26. wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not Shone to declare unto you all the counsel of God not all the Council of Paul not all the Council of Barnabas or anyone else all the counsel of God what he received from God he gave as of God to those that that he witnessed to I have not shown to declare unto you all the counsel take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this look what Paul says oh I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock yeah Paul said I know amen now I didn't pull the quote but you know brother Branham said approximately the same thing that upon his departure that there would be Grievous wolves come in not godly and now how do they come in they come in in sheep's clothing they come in saying the same thing acting the same way yes playing the same part because to them there's no earnesty it's it's the pretension to try to fit in it's someone remember I told you God has patience you know who else has patience the devil the devil has patience he doesn't care how long it takes to get you his ultimate end goal is to get you he doesn't care how who he has to use what channels he has to go through and he's very patient to make sure regardless of what he's going to get you and when he sees a little when he sees a little change when he sees a person it's not as dedicated or consecrated to the Lord or praying or reading or whatever it is in your life and all that we consider that we do that he that's Victory to them Satan that is Victory amen but Paul tells us I know that Grievous walls are going to come in brother man said the same thing I know that Grievous wolves are going to come in have they come in absolutely thank you absolutely by a large portion it's our time it's our place to earnestly contend for that faith that was once given never Jude said it was once delivered to the Saints and we know that was to be and and it was delivered at the day of Pentecost and what happened it all fell apart and went through but what was to happen in this day there was to be a restoration a turning of the hearts of the children the faith back to the fathers amen us the children the Faith of Our Fathers turned back Amen to be restored once again to what the word the truth of God's word the pure unadulterated word God sent a man a prophet to bring that word to us contending for that Faith himself insane they're going to do the same thing as they deal with Paul I'm paraphrasing obviously you must contend for that faith fight for every inch of ground Saints and look at this world around us look at this world around us I saw some statistics the other day and these statistics just didn't surprise me but floored me just and that's not the right it it Grieves me I saw that these statistics because remember everything about life everything almost everything about life everything about this Cosmos that we live in is is against faith you know that pretty much everything in this Cosmos today greats against your faith the world teaches don't believe it if you can't see it touch it feel it they come against anything and everything that is of faith amen of course there's not not only now do we have hospitals pretty much everywhere but now they have and I'm not again against hospitals I'm just for Christ man that's like a lot of people say uh you know they're against brother so-and-so or sister so and so look I'm not against anybody I'm just for Jesus and if me being for Jesus comes in contrast to somebody else whether and so be it but I'm not going to lead the ground of being for Jesus even if that puts me in contrast to somebody else so I'm not against the hospitals I'm just pro-jesus I'm pro-divine healing I'm Pro miracles amen are you amen hospitals are good medicine's good doctor's good but now you got not only the hospitals around but you got urgent cares daughter descend the landscape everywhere urgent cares all over the place Doctors Hospitals everything everything that goes against our faith what is this world teaching us everything pretty much to say everything about this world is teaching us to disbelieve God and to not have faith in God look the statistics I saw the other day they just they were very discouraging I I just gotta admit uh I I don't let it get me down because we understand the world that we live in I think they gave four or five categories one of them was patriotism the patriotism in this country I mean when I was a kid it was you know you went to elementary school you did two things you prayed and you said the Pledge of Allegiance yes yes where's it gone they took out the Bible prayer and got out of schools and they replaced it with hatred guns and violence they wonder why this has happened they said well we take God out you introduce violence you take love out you introduce hatred that's the bottom line of it the media is celebrating and pretending that this girl that went in to shoot these kids up is now the victim yeah please I'm sorry this that person may have run across people that were very rude and mean or something but a true Christian a true God Holy Ghost feel Godly Christian is the only place that any of these people anybody can find love today true love yes yes amen the other worlds he said oh it's okay you know you're you're fine everything's fine that's not love is I want you to make it to Heaven regardless That's My Hope and prayer is that you make it to heaven that's true love amen now now that person is the victim not the three little children not the three adults that were killed but the one that murdered them is now the victim now explain that to me they took out gun they took out God prayer patriotism Pledge of Allegiance replace it with what violence death guns hatred when you take God out what do you have left that's all you have left patriotism has dropped from like in the seven and this is just in the past 20 years I think it was has dropped from like 76 percent to below 50 percent for the country how do you think people what people think about this country oh it used to be considered the greatest country on earth a lot of people still believe it that way there are a lot of people that live in this country now that do not aspire to that amen amen if we really went to a war with a with a superpower if China Russia decided to get together and and pick up arms even though they hate each other but you know the enemy the any of my the enemy of my enemy is my friend even though they hate each other they believe in one thing they have a common goal of communism if they got together and joined their forces we'd have no chance amen and that may who knows that may be what happens to make the prophecy brother round border to border Coast to Coast destroyed amen it's down look we wouldn't we wouldn't be able to get enough people to fight no there wouldn't be enough young men to to take our arms to fight against them right Faith down from again in the 70s to like 30 some percent drop 40 points in just 20 years or so Faith down amen Family Values morals marriage having children down below 50 percent again morals Christianity godliness the moralities that are that that our nation we'll just say our nation was founded on down below 50 in the 30s or something some real low number of this country but you know the one thing that is up that people consider of importance this is if I didn't say so this is a list of the things that people consider important now in their lives they don't consider patriotism important they don't consider Faith Family Values getting married having children uh having morals in their lives that's not of any importance to them anymore but you know the one thing that is up in importance in people's lives I probably don't have to say it you know what it's gonna know what I'm gonna say money money is one category that's now above 50 of importance in people's lives they consider filthy looker more important than patriotism Faith morals Family Values money that's what it's all become about today amen money a man kneels on a football field in protests of the national anthem in the American flag and he celebrated as some great hero another man on the high school football field kneels in prayer and they arrest him they well I think they fired him they might not have arrested they fired him one man's in protest the other is praying to God by himself didn't instruct his team to do so didn't ask anybody else to join him he just took a kneel and prayed and he was fired from his job they celebrate abortion clinics left and right they're celebrated amen they're they they protest for abortion and they're celebrated they protest against abortion and they get arrested did my wife send these sisters that wanted that man in Canada he got arrested twice in in the same month for protesting outside of a peacefully he's not throwing Molotov cocktails he's not burning anything he's not shooting or looting he's just standing there in silent prayer and protest and they arrested him and jail just for standing on the street corner they have drag stories drag queens stories in public libraries for children and they're celebrated this man I talked about the other day Kirk Cameron come out with a children's book about God and values and and and morality and there's only a handful of libraries across this country he could even get into to try to to bring it people hate him put him out won't let him do it drag stories oh yeah sure they're having the Congress approached the heads of military and said why is our military uh men and women subject to these drag shows and their children and one of them spoke up and said I didn't even know that was going on you're a five-star general in charge of the military and you didn't even know this was happening it's sad print but that's where we've gotten to they're more concerned about what adjective or what pronoun they call you instead of how to load a gun or defeat an enemy or to do anything our military should be trained to do if you want to learn a pronoun I don't care that's fine if you want to be called him heard they them that's up to you I don't I I we live in a free world-free Society during coven casinos and all kinds of places like that were allowed to stay open but the churches had to remain closed do you remember that amen even people even during that time there were churches and pastors arrested because they insisted on having church services amen thank God lord allowed nothing ever like that King does but they were arrested made to stay closed why because everything about this world is going away from that Jude says content friend we have to fight I'm not saying fight the government I'm not saying fight the police I'm not but fight the devil yeah yes because that is the bottom line to all of this they stand and they scream and yell at what's coming in the front door as they're sneaking in the back and a lot of people don't realize it that's why you have to have on the whole armor of God and contend contend for the faith is Satan is not just going to give up and let you have it he's not he's not just gonna go away we have to contend every day how do we contend put on your boxing gloves of faith amen put on the whole armor of God fight him defeat him with the only Weaponry but the best Weaponry The Undefeated Weaponry of the scripture amen Faith that's who Christ is Christ is the word all these things of the world that's happening all around us it's sad to watch like I said when I was a kid going to elementary school first thing in the morning you've prayed and you said the Pledge of Allegiance yes standing with your hand over your heart amen yes that's that that was normal you could have a Bible very few kids I remember in school had one you could have a Bible on your desk or inside your desk carry it with you amen now you're kicked out if you do something like that they won't let you they'll expel you if you try to bring a Bible into school now maybe not all of them but it's gotten to the place that I'm thankful my son-in-law and daughter are able to take care of their children without having to send them to these places because I I tell you just makes you wonder what all of these programs and things are indoctrinating the kids today and the programs that they go through to to make them think this is okay teachers get on uh different things and and they won't let them say pledge of allegiance to the American flag but she said but I got a flag I'll have them that they can pledge allegiance to and the camera spans over to the rainbow flag they can pledge allegiance to that contend amen contend that is a part of contending I know it's I I I can guarantee it's not easy for my daughter and and my son-in-law to do what they do to take care of their children that's hard right they're missing a whole other income that my that my daughter could get possibly if she put them in daycare or in public school or something like that but they're contending you've got to contend to hold that Faith to hold that line and they're responsible for holding that line for their children as much as themselves that's a hard thing to do you've had to do it as well we had to do it as well with them things have changed even from when they were there but we can continuously contend for that faith amen because that's that's the thing that keeps us going amen that's the thing that keeps us afloat praise the Lord Victory Is Ours Victory Is Ours in Jesus Christ amen who has made Us Victorious he has conquered death hell in the grave and everything that's in between he gave us the keys now we stand victorious in Jesus name he took our place so that we can take his now let's continue to contend for that don't let Satan steal it from you don't let one little lesbian talked about last week a little trial or something that that God's allowing to come our way to derail us or to get us so depressed down disappointed discouraged that we can't even wake up in the morning and I've been there it's not easy when those forces come so strong and and and would even use someone that's dear to you to do it that hurts it hurts deep Cuts deep but God always takes that sap and you stand up on your feet you say though the skin worms destroy my flesh and my body shall I see God amen amen gotta continue to contend friend the world's not going to do it for you this world's headed the opposite way amen amen what was considered wrong in my day is now there's nothing wrong with it can you imagine if it goes another 30 40 years what is considered wrong today is there even anything considered wrong today I mean I don't know because you see these different District Attorneys out here and and and people murdering other people and they're set free people pushing other people on the train tracks to be ran over by trains and get busted in the head with a ball bat and they're let and they're just set free makes me wonder is there anything that isn't that is wrong anymore makes you wonder morals and where it's gotten but it helps you understand amen people have people have crawled into self-preservation mode and that's a sad place to be because when you're in self-preservation mode you're only thinking about yourself you're only doing things for yourself you're only going to do what helps you and yourself amen but that's not the life of a Christian amen brother Bram said when you live your life for others you're staring heaven in the face help us continue to contend Saints amen contend for that Faith don't let Satan defeat you that stand if we could amen God Is Watching Over Us keeping us taking care of us helping us well we got to do our part as well him we have to do our part God doesn't just do it all for us it's our part to do we have to take care of those things and continue to contend to the faith amen amen praise the Lord fight every step of the way amen praise the Lord I had this Psalm but for some reason I just don't feel led to sing it right now amen see something else the Lord might just a song chorus something to encourage help us amen let's sing this um just any day now see if Mike can find it we can bring it up most of us probably know it but if it's in the system we can bring it up and see it on there just any day now plus it would hopefully have the words on it or the verses I'm enlisting that amen just any day now our Lord is coming by my friend what a team it'll be [Music] our Lord is coming he'll be returning for you and me or I've been watching and I've been waiting just any day now his face I'll see each time I stop and take the time to look around me I see the signs of his appearing everywhere the things he said would come to pass on now before us and I feel a strange excitement in the air or just any day now our Lord is coming he'll be returning for you and me foreign time me waiting waiting just any day now his face I'll see oh there's this longing in my heart for his appearing a gladly behind this here below for this journey has been long and I'm so weary but Lord somehow I feel I'm so much closer Home oh just any day now our Lord is [Music] his face I'll see you one more time now our Lord is coming he'll be returning for you and me amen foreign [Music] his face I'll see praise the Lord Jesus Amen to see any day now Saints see that amen I'm depending on that praise the Lord Jesus nothing in this world can hold me nothing in this world appeals to me amen only Jesus Christ in his word God richly bless you pray something was said the bless the end amen it is a battle and then we're not in a battle against each other we're a battle against the devil amen your brothers sisters not your enemy Satan is your enemy amen and we fight continuously to hold down that uh that truth amen praise the Lord I wanted to mention to you you know next week coming is Easter amen uh and brother Roger Collins is going to have some Easter services uh he's the only one I don't know if anybody else is or not I don't know uh I tell you what I know and this is what I know if any other church is having them they didn't send it to me so um but brother Rogers having service uh on Friday night at Seven uh Saturday night at six and Sunday morning he's at 10 30 of course we'll have our Sunday we'll have our Easter Sunday service here and he's also having a service Sunday afternoon at five o'clock amen so please remember that he also streams uh if you're unable to go or want to watch uh he also streams if you need the address to where their new church is just let me know I'll get you the address if you feel like you want to attend that so I talked to brother Dan uh Dan Evans the interim pastor the Tabernacle and he talks about wanting to try to do something but um I said well you know as far as those nights I know Fridays Friday night Saturday nights nights are kind of difficult sometimes for uh some of the older ones have a hard time seeing at night and that but uh but I I said if you do something just let me know or if y'all have something go on or meal or services and I haven't heard I have not heard back from him so uh as of right now I don't know that they're doing anything at the Tabernacle so all I know is that these services that brother Roger sent to me so that's all I have also I talked to Craig this week I asked him about the barber shop of course you know this place is leaving uh well by faith Hallelujah they haven't they haven't committed to that yet but they don't know they don't have a choice so they have to leave um but I asked him about the barbershop and he said well they got a couple years left on their lease and they're doing real well so I don't know about that I just tell the Lord I said Lord are there any of the hindrance and move them but I don't beverage a barber shop if they have you know to make money in that but I actually personally would like to get that place uh if we could and open the wall up right there and have our entrance come in that door and have that have that Estee fuel out there and have an office and a place for Sunday school and that over here and since that doesn't look like at least this moment is going to happen I was thinking about and I was talking to the Lord about it in prayer this morning about maybe asking him at least for now if we can get one of these places behind us as far as I know both of these places the Yokohama and the fiber care or whatever they're empty and seeing how much you would charge us to rent one of those two facilities out and that would move my office over there and have a Sunday school room over there we could try to open it up to have Fellowship luncheons things like that uh sort of a fellowship hall if you will so I plan on doing that and asking him so I just wanted to keep you abreast to let you know the things that I'm thinking what's going on in my mind and uh how I would kind of like unless the Lord opens some other place up um I've looked at a lot of places I've looked at other places maybe to go most of them are a lot more expensive but I always felt like if the Lord moved us from here it would be a more permanent place or place by itself that we're not in the storefront or something so but whatever the Lord wants that's what I want so but I I at this time I don't have any plans of leaving or else so if we're not going to I want to try to look at expanding this a little bit and making it the thing I dislike probably the most is the bathrooms we always bathrooms that were ours that were in our facility but whatever the Lord provides it should be going bathroom that much anyway except maybe the children or something but so but God bless you again I just wanted to keep you aware of that so that you know what my thoughts and all are and we'll go from there so we'll see what the Lord has to do with that and I give it to you as a point of Prayer can I ask the church to please pray this morning and his blast this young lady is sit on my she came in and she was so sick and she's just gotten sicker and sick and I was finally able to prank with her and and she's got walnuts here it's strep throat and she believes it's strep throat and can't get her into Urgent Care can't get her into the hospital and and because she's indigent she's without a home and I've been Sheltering her off and off today I waited and waited was my first opportunity to really pray for her and pray her in to the Lord she's not able to talk she's not she's not very responsive because she hasn't been drinking water it's she's a mess but so I'm asking you to please believe with me to just bomber with the holy spirit so that she is just you know she can make up she can recover herself from the spirit of addiction or the spirit of um these other things of course what's her name her name is um okay so um we have a name types that we when you pray for her so amen thank you sister anybody else amen God bless you love you appreciate you thank you for coming today amen we'll be dismissed I'm not going to touch anybody today because of strep I mean it's probably all over me and I just don't I don't want any money so I'm just a good thing how's it a lot yeah thank you sister appreciate that amen Lord
