prayer requests that i'll try to get to forgive me if i uh somehow misplace or forget not to mention one there are quite a few this morning here so some of the written ones i i don't think there's any more back there from brother angel yes that we prayed for his mother-in-law uh struggling uh you know with depression over the loss of her daughter and uh it's also worried about her youngest son being in the world so loss in the world so i remember them also he asked for prayer for marcos gomez senior he's getting surgery and they're removing a toe and he's diabetic so definitely want to remember that amen uh prayer for his mom dad and brother forgot to fill them and heal them and bless them amen yes and also yes prayer for his family that god would fill them and heal us and change them to be more like him like jesus every day amen prayer for and blessings for uh little marcus uh junior marcos jr uh today is his 10th birthday so uh thank you for that he's right there in the back row there thank you for that also we want to remember the zincas in prayer as well and their family just keep them in prayer at this time and also for my family as well they're having some issues uh with their washer washing machine uh so you spread the lord we'll be with them in that yeah sister omar also put in their prayer requests for sister becky coffey she's having a hard time with uh with a virus uh she's still in the hospital i'm not sure if it's the virus it is but yeah yovid with coven okay so she is being diagnosed diagnosed with covid so please remember her in prayer and also sister karen is not feeling well as our sister karen is not well as also um so keep her in prayer as well does anyone else have a uh her blessing yes really guys yes uh first of all um as i mentioned this past week my wife had her visit with oncologists and we thanked the lord uh it wasn't cancer thank god but for a couple of weeks she's had very bad discomfort and pain in her left shoulder and um she had called er this morning they couldn't take her till tomorrow afternoon so um she called uh the doctor that she worked for he prescribed something he thinks it's a pinched nerve but i i don't need to know you don't need to know what it is because god knows him and he's going to deliver amen yes so we'll keep brother dennis's wife in prayer as well this morning uh does anyone else have a spoken prayer request yesterday yes when um my wife just texted me a little while ago and she said that if you get a prayer for our landlord um you got in contact with someone cobid so he's really worried because he can't look forward to not miss work so if you just keep him in prayer yeah sure let's all stand this morning just if you want to lift up your hand if you have unspoken prayer requests and i'll just ask brother dennis if you would pray over these needs this morning lord jesus we bow our hearts and heads together by faith knowing that you're a true and living god lord jesus you are comfort our strength our healer our redeemer our our shelter in the time of storm our joy our happiness you are everything to us father i'm i'm just scratching the surface of what you mean to us father and lord i can recall as i read even this morning there was a lady that had a a daughter it was a vex with the devil and she persistently came to you even the disciples tried to draw her away from from you father but you saw the faith that she had and that lord she knew that you were the only one that could deliver her daughter and father there are many today that are sick even with that covenant 19 we know as you told the prophet of our day then if you pray and believe in faith not even cancer will stand in the way and not even covet will stand in the way for thou art our high priests that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and by your stripes we are healed and father we believe whatever each one in each request has been read and needs a healing touch may we be like that lady persistent and believe that once we ask it is a finished work you painted it full at calvary father and lord we believe that when you said it is done it is finished that is a complete work for all that we have need of and lord may you touch or people today that's made an effort to be here maybe someone that hasn't surrendered their life to you this world is dying this world's falling apart and you're the only safe place you're the only healer you're the only redeemer you're the only savior speak through their hearts may it's not a time to just take our walk with you lightly father it's a time to surrender that your life may fully express itself in us father all lord bless each and every one the unspoken prayer request their hearts were lifted up to you may you just grant him exceedingly abundantly more so we know what we can ever expect to receive father o lord bless our pastor as he brings forth the word lord as he labors firmly may you use them to speak to our hearts may our hearts be open may our hearts be softened to receive your word this day knowing that uh with faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god and lord you gave a prophet a promise that a rapturing faith lies in those tapes and lord our brother stands for your word stands for the truth may we stand with them father may we just i'll always have that wedding garment on granted lord bless each one lord we may our hearts burn within us as we know we've met with you along the way this time in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen y'all may be seated one prayer or one testimony came in this morning um i'm not sure if he came in this morning brother bennett sent me it from brother pan uh brother pat had a testimony that he sent to brother bennett about working on his car so i'm just going to read it as it's written here so brother pat says i put my engine back in my uh and my car he was trying to put the header back on in a new configuration and it wouldn't fit he's been wrestling with it for about a month i heated and beat over and over refused to fit i took two i took it to two different machine shops with no luck i thought i should cut apart and start over i try to cut it or try to fit again nope not fitting he was frustrated about to cry and he prayed to jesus to help him and the header just dropped into place all by itself so with all the necessary clearances and you know he just praised the lord he jumped up and down and it was so relieved and happy so praise the lord for now he's able to help us with anything that we ask him with yes does anyone else have a testimony um this morning or a song special again let me know if you don't have to let me know in advance but if you could just a little bit

the lord has done for us [Music] give thanks [Music] jesus christ [Music] [Music] is because of what the lord has done [Music] because of what the lord has done amen amen praise the lord jesus i believe that's all that's upon our hearts amen amen amen giving thanks into the lord jesus he's so good to you know as zach said you know we're entering into another time of celebration of what this country considers a thanksgiving there's other countries that have thanksgivings but um they of course have different times different seasons this is the time and season that we celebrate it there's a lot of history that's involved in it but you know thanksgiving is the only american holiday the only true really american holiday that we have most the other holidays or from overseas and paganism things like that but this is the one holiday that is a true real uh thanksgiving that we have and of course thanksgiving simply means to give thanks and uh brother zach without any direction for me or anybody he's just being led of the lord singing the songs of thanksgiving to the lord today amen amen and as i have and usually do because because of what i consider uh the importance of this time uh to uh to reflect upon the thanksgivings that we have to the lord jesus so in that in retrospect of that or in in and that being said uh i usually try to take a thanksgiving service and that's going to be today so i want to do a thanksgiving message today but as i do a thanksgiving message i i usually before i start i like to open the floor i know zach gave everybody the opportunity to give a testimony today or to give a praise report or whatever amen and if you'd like to do that right now i want to open the floor and encourage you if there's something on your heart or something that you'd like to say to public uh of what god's done for you this week this month this year in thanksgiving to him uh i give you the opportunity to open the floor if you'd like to give a testimony to the lord right now feel free to you're not obligated to don't feel pressured to but if it's something that's on your heart that you want to save for the lord now is the opportunity to do so i usually spend an hour plus up here every service and i usually pour out my heart to you and uh but now is your opportunity so you want to pull your heart out before us to the lord then then now's the time so brother angel start us off brother last week the lord sitting there talking to me i uh thought to even lie about giving thanks and helping my son with his house and trying to prepare a home i thank god for giving me the strength to help him and then for some reason i injured my leg i broke my bone in two places i couldn't be no help from and i felt bad about it so i took them a meal took at this house and i asked him apologize for my my incident and i sit there thinking about thanksgiving came into my heart i said lord let this thanksgiving be different let my shepherd speak to me about giving thanks please send on his heart lord to teach us what real thanksgiving is about what thanksgiving is to you lord to each and every one of us last night i went to bed and i couldn't sleep so i sat through my lounge chair i asked the lord this morning put it on your servant's heart lord to speak to us on this subject and i didn't think much about it i just left my heart there so this morning i come and i just i felt a strong anointing dude amen and then lord you open the service with thanksgiving songs and all your prop your servant here our shepherd he's brought the subject forth so i don't know what else to thank him for except i'm praying he brought tips amen not just for today lord that you remind us to be grateful for not just the good things he brings in our lives yes amen but even the tragedies you know even death itself because everything gives us we should be thankful for including dying yes brother because once we pass on it we could be more thankful to get home yes well this journey is long and scary and it's it's hatred towards us just cuts us all like a knife and if it wasn't for you lord placing on our hearts that thanksgiving oh lord i don't know where we'd end but we'd be hopeless that's thank you it's kind of long-winded of me but thank you brother i'm just that way i i want to thank god for all of you especially this morning i wish we could all sit together on a thanksgiving day and just sing songs of praises and amen and feast on the glory that god gives us so strong that he defeat his that it would last all year long amen praise the lord just make us drunk on your spirit father is what i ask let me stagger around i don't care about anything else i'm just thankful that you come and touch each and every one of us and continue amen these are my testimonies could you speak up a little bit and i don't say that just for you i mean that i say that now as a wholesale because it's not just me i can hear you fine others may not and the microphone's over here to pick up your testimony too those that are streaming they can't see you so it's really good if they can hear you so sorry about that but it's just i give god praise because i have been asking years from my family and i have an aunt that's 80 years old well they were born and raised and now she's come out of that she's going to church she's studying the bible you know the denomination catholic they don't read it right that's fine but you want to know the truth you got to look at it amen so you know and this cathy my daughter she said the lord has been waking me up and i've been praying all night you know that that's a good story but taking god praise yes my grandson it's just little by little and you don't god you don't give up on god amen he doesn't give up on us right amen praise god all the glory and all the praise i thank them for my giving under my phone amen to have too much and i can go on but we know what the truth is i love the lord amen praise the lord so true yes thank you for that yeah i do have a message on my heart to give you but i want to give you all the time you need anybody sisters well we were singing this song about shoes on my feet this is this camera lord i i want to give this testimony if there's a chance and um gabriel is my great grandson so you know the little ones they grow fast yeah and his shoes are expensive right yeah so julie my daughter and i went to we went i mean one of the people's shoes she was going to buy school shoes and i was going to buy shoes so we looked about what was available in the size and i picked up black nice looking textures and she said mom are we sure we don't want to get that because of the dress and i said yes so we went up to the register and um they rang up four dollars and fifty cents because they were going out of stock god for five amen amen here this morning anybody else wonderful and she was sleeping so they had the lights off but she was telling them to turn off the light that it was so bright and then we like thought it was like so my family yeah amen praise the lord i hope everybody on the microphone got back on the streaming that's beautiful anyone else yeah just a quick uh steal one from uh the messages i just it's been on my heart i just want to thank god um i'm not what i should be i'm not what i want to be but i thank god i'm not what i used to do praise the lord amen yes uh i sure want to concur with all the other ones that testified all through this year this has been a different tough year you got to use wisdom but it's like our pastor has said you cannot be afraid to do the things you need to do amen and be led of the spirit of god amen and i can testify all through this year different times the lord has concealed me come for me strengthen me it can be unlimited if you if i had the mind to remember right and um but i i can recall this week um uh two three days ago i i got out of bed you know i do deal with back problems i was walking like the hunchback of notre dame i said lord and uh took some pain reliever and just trust the lord and i because we're human i was thinking oh it's probably going to be worse sunday morning it was the best day and amen praise the lord i want to thank the right you know it's like that situation when our lord healed those ten lepers and one came back to thank him amen and i want to thank the lord so much i i can remember what he's done for me and all his promises that will be fulfilled you know including the catching up in the air amen we've got a lot to be careful yes praise the lord yes sir brother amen brother yeah i'm not a real good speaker i am grateful and thankful for this church i have a few months left my dilemma amen and i was presented with another obstacle so i talked and hopefully we worked it out that i can get it done and by may i'll be free thank god thank god i'm grateful for this church coming to church and being part of the church has helped me get through all this amen and i really appreciate you all praise the lord well you've been a blessing to us brother that's for sure sometimes you don't realize what a what a difference you make in a congregation because you don't you think well i don't sing and i don't play an instrument and i don't preach and i don't do this and that and but uh just your mere presence and the spirit of god coming in is uh is everything amen so anybody else joel um amen amen praise the lord joel said he thanks god for this wonderful beautiful family in the church so amen amen angel thank you i mean we could sit here all day and do this but it's going to make it kind of quick it's got two things um during this hard time i know i've i've been able to bless and help people around me you know who don't have the lord and they see the difference so they're just amazed because and even this hard time we're still being blessed we'll still be taken care of yeah it's nothing that we're doing because it's time when we've been shut down we've been receiving the lord's just have faith in him so that's what i've been doing amen um the other one is my wife when yesterday we were me and my brother had to go pick something up a desk for her and she sent me but she actually called me and said this amazing story just blew my mind and um this lady when she was an elder she was passing and she actually she passed and revived her and she asked for a piece of paper really quick and they gave it to her yeah and she wrote it was real so to me that was just something amazing though for the lord to be so loving i know that they might not know so finish the story well she said give me a paper and she wrote some words down and it said it's real and she was laying back down everybody was grabbing they're like what's real what's real and all she did was she pointed up emma so we know and that touched me and just my spirits lifted and i was like praising the lord driving home with this desk and i mean i was just amazed with the lord how amazing and loving is for us every day amen friend if you can't feel god moving i don't know we're just wet wood i guess did you catch the top part of the testimony of brother pat's too yeah the part of the testimony that brother pat gave he did all he could do to fix this thing he took it to two expert mechanics and they couldn't do it and one simple please jesus help me the thing falls perfectly into place i texted back and i said i said my we could save ourselves a whole lot of grief if we would just start out with that sometimes we forget you know anybody else is this julian i just want to thank the lord because he has kept us healthy through all this my friends my church family my family at home my extended family amen the lord has just been wonderful and kept us healthy and giving us all we need yes absolutely amen yes that that's a powerful testimony during these times friend you know there's a lot of people don't have that testimony for amen anybody else how great is it to be uh be thankful to be able to give thanks to somebody else amen you know yes that's just awesome yes praise the lord you got another one go ahead just to give us some joy and the other day my parents brought a puppy because a lady had it in the back of her car that's kind of a two-sided prayer i guess kids are like yeah your parents like all right when i injured my foot and on a i spent a couple days home and it just got excruciatingly bad i couldn't take it i thought it was a sprain but it turned out to be a lot more nervous but uh my wife said you need to go urgent care no i said all right she says no you gotta go so i went so i looked around i said oh well if i'm gonna go somewhere show me where to go and it came up northwest urgent care right down orange golden latoya and uh tornado then i walk in and sit down and take me back there and it was hurting so bad i told the nurses you gotta you gotta take me up wheelchair sure navi took me to the back furthest room and i said well i'm glad i got a wheelchair but i'm sitting there she says well she goes out i have some news for she's it's broken in two places jesus and it's serious i said okay so we're gonna fit you with a boat and give you some pain pills and stuff and say okay thank you she goes do you have insurance and brother sisters before i could even answer the woman i said no ma'am i don't have that much insurance but i do have blessed assurance i said and i know it's going and she stopped at the door going out she drowned she looked at me and i don't know what happened but the next thing she said thank you angel i needed that amen so the way i see this right foot of mine it's not an accident it's a blessing i had to be somewhere to tell somebody something yes something so simple you know amen yes so now when i think about insurance i go next citizen amen no more amen but i'm thankful for the lord how many of us are willing to let our legs get broke so we can witness to somebody that's that's something to think about but you know the lord works in mysterious ways right so amen we trust him in all things another one i meant to mention too sister julie higgins had sent me and my wife testimony she sent me yesterday pretty lengthy about somebody she's been witnessing to it at work and his name is james and she want us to keep him in prayer but she gave him a church age book a seal book and uh 20th century prophet maybe i can't remember she gave him some some literature uh for him to read and he seemed extremely excited uh to get it and what she was telling him and you said you just never know but she wanted us to pray for him again his name is james so i remember him and oh man well i was me and brother roger was doing some work well we've done a good bit of work this week but um we were at a house on aina or just off aina and uh you know a lot of times if we talk to people for very long we end up talking about the lord that's right praise god and we're ministers and things like that and and i'll just say i hope because we're supposed to go back to this house that right as we were leaving to get in the truck he started talking about serpenty and garden of eden and uh we were leaving because he had another appointment to go to but i started talking to him and uh i'm looking forward to continuing that conversation so i don't didn't even get his name but anyway so you pray for that amen anybody else i just i want to thank the lord for my family and you know all these blessings in my mind and our lives and always watching over us this year or earlier this year many of you know uh got diagnosed with uh charlotte i was infected with covet 19 and the lord just you know i was really frustrated when i found out or you know sorry starting to get sick and i realized it's still in denial and then i finally got tested and uh you know came out positive and i was just pretty frustrated you know why'd you let this happen to me you know but uh you know it you know i'm just thankful you know and the lord spoke spoke back to me and you know over the over the time and just like well i brought you through you you know you killed you you didn't get close to anywhere you know being on you know death bed or you know the worst symptoms that i had was a headache and a just a mild fever but you know nothing else i lost my taste and smell for quite a few months uh it still kind of affected me uh to this point but i'm just thankful that the lord watched over me and my family and that you know i was hugging my children and my wife you know before i even knew i was sick um and yeah it was just they didn't get sick or come down with any symptoms before that and right that's everything that he's done watching over us during this pandemic as well olivia had mentioned to you just uh very thankful to the lord amen amen praise the lord as he said in the same home and none of the three other got it but i want to say that i'm thankful uh zach's doing a tremendous job with the song service now you know you don't expect somebody in and take over and just be you know but he's grown in it and doing well and he's a real blessing to me i know that and i think he's doing a tremendous job and i'm very thankful for that myself anybody else amen yes i was thanking the lord for that this morning because it come to my mind how there for a period of time it seemed like one of the two of them or somebody you know family was sick all the time but for a year or so the lord's blessed and kept healthy anybody else well i'm very thankful for all of you thankful for the lord jesus it's been a strange year it's been a different year but we expected different years to come amen when it comes we think oh wow okay it's here and then we reflect on it and we think well we know what the lord's doing and we're moving forward with that but we went from the building over on cortero to the holiday inn to this place and the lord has blessed us with this place and i'm very thankful for brother nat and his wife and brother roger and his wife for all that's gone in to make this a beautiful place amen i don't know how long we'll be here uh especially after the uh how the congregation is growing and uh there's not a whole lot of potential here unless you put a lot of money and a lot of change into this building so the lord's got something else for us and amen we'll just move forward with that me and brother rogers already been talking about that and whatever the lord's will might be but i'm very thankful i sit back there looking and uh the columns look real nice brother roger came and put a couple of the columns he had got up and uh everything is just it's a really nice place and i said lord if you have us here till the coming of the lord till you take us home then that's fine too but whatever the will of the lord is right that's right i'm very thankful because he's brought us from there the next place he give us this place and uh the lord's blessed it he's blessed you he's blessed us together and of course it's been a part of my testimony and you know when i get to that part you know usually when you get to the end of the year and and if you allow me for a moment i'm kind of starting into my message so um but when you reflect on that a lot of times you get to the end of the year and you get to the end of the year and you reflect on the year before and people make new year's resolutions and all those things but you know we have a time and a season again uh as zach said and others have said every day that we live should be a thanksgiving to the lord amen it is a thanksgiving to the lord and um and we're very thankful that the lord does so we thank him all the time um and and what he does for us and how he blesses us but it comes this time like you know a mother's day or a father's day you love your mother 365 days a year but you know there's that one day and the restaurants fill up and the the flower shops empty out and stuff like that because you take that time to acknowledge that uh every day is a mother's day but you take that day to really put forth an acknowledgement and we take this time to really put forth that acknowledgement knowing that this country was founded on christian godly principles among it was built it was built and founded upon the bible and godly principles and freedom of religion and freedom of worship and to allow people the ability and without threat of life or imprisonment to open this bible and to read it and to talk about jesus and to have a picture of jesus hanging in your home or in your church and have actually uh buildings that are designated as churches that are even tax free now that may go away one day but are still to this day the place that we live well that began in in the beginning and of course the the pilgrims that came over and 1621 they say was the first was the first thanksgiving because they had their harvest and that yearly harvest and all that god had done for them and bringing them from here and keeping them safe and bringing them to this other place and and no doubt as brother angel said tragedy followed a lot of their lives in a lot of their journey but god still was faithful and blessed them and gave them bountifully uh their their harvest that they had and they took that bountiful harvest that god had blessed and they and they offered that back to god you know that's kind of a part of the thing that that god we talk about with tithing and offering we we give that back to god it's a wave offering it's something that we offer back to the lord and say thank you god for blessing me so much thank you god for giving to me thank you for what you've done for us this whole time and they had the native americans and the pilgrims that were there and they celebrated integrated and they they celebrated their newfound freedoms and their bountiful harvest and and the blessings that god had given and that's the foundation now after that there was um washington celebrated it and then you got to like different presidents and they didn't really celebrate it until abraham lincoln came along and it's amazing how many people in this country like abraham lincoln and is there and is their favorite president ever uh people that maybe don't even know god or don't worship god or don't serve god but recognize and give acknowledgement to a man like abraham lincoln who was a godly man who didn't even have a book to read as a child except fox book of martyrs in the bible that was his influence and that man who became the greatest president probably in the history of this country was a godly man that people look up to and recognizing that the characteristics and and what he was molded in as a child and the man that he become and the president he become put thanksgiving as a national holiday and ever since abraham lincoln it's been celebrated the third thurs or the last thursday of every of every november thanksgiving as a permanent uh holiday as a permanent sign that this country and what it was founded on wants to take just a moment and thank god for all that he's done for us families come together we cook food we get fat and all that goes with thanksgiving but thanksgiving is really the giving of thanks and the giving of thanks is giving of thanks to our maker to our lord to our savior to our god that's what thanksgiving is all about and that's where thanksgiving come from i believe and i'm going to take this uh time next for the 30 minutes or so and because i built this message around you know the that we were going to open the floor for testimonies and uh make it available for everybody to give their testimonies and your little sermons they were a blessing to me and i appreciate your testimonies and appreciate what you said for the lord and i believe he does too but just give public acknowledgement so now i want to take uh take this title that i want to title this and title it take an account so at the end of the year we kind of take account of the year before but to me being a christian and a thanksgiving to the lord jesus this is the take account time for me because this is the time of thanksgiving to the lord so this is just simply titled take an account and what i mean is taking an account just as your testimonies were back of everything that god has done for us and everything how god has blessed us of course through our lives but through this year it's a yearly thing but through this year and thinking back of how god has blessed us we've taken two services basically the last two sundays and and delved into that to some degree uh how god has kept us how god has protected us how god has watched over and and blessed our church bless this building bless our congregation bless each one of you and those that are coming still come and and i will testify and believe to you that as i pray every morning that god is going to continue to increase it as as he would but only according to his will right yes amen i i i'm not looking for a you know thousand member church or something but whatever god wants whoever god wants and his perfect will is that's our desire amen so that's that's my heart and that's where i am and i'm so very thankful for my family i'm thankful for my natural family i'm thankful for my spiritual family i could not uh i was i was praying yesterday and and in my prayer i was asking god i said god could you just give me some other words to say to express what's in my heart of how i feel about you because thank you friends just doesn't seem to cut it sometimes right you know we thank him all the time and we say the words thank you but sometimes thank you just doesn't feel like enough it just doesn't express what's in your heart what you're feeling deep inside is way more than just thank you lord or thanks god i appreciate it or something like that your heart just explodes to the point you just don't have the words to express it and i say that about what he's done for us and how i feel towards you i i'm very thankful and i love you with all my heart amen god's blessed us and uh we're together again and worshiping and praising the lord so i want to turn into a scripture now in job chapter one and it's outstanding to me that brother angel jr um said what he said about the year and about the thanksgivings that we have towards god because that's exactly the scripture i'm going to read exactly the scripture job chapter one i'm i'm going to begin reading with verse 20. amen so let's stand to our feet if we could as we read the word of god in honor of the word yes uh and bow our heads again for word of prayer father we're thankful today and again lord as i say that word it just still just doesn't seem to be enough but lord you know our hearts and that's the most important thing lord from our lips we express to you how much we love you and how much we thank you and you know and we appreciate god how good you've been to us lord we want to share that lord with others that are around us and help witness god that others might see and know the greatness that all that is you and lord and what you do for our lives every day yes the testimonies that have gone forth lord this morning and how good they have been how encouraging they've been to me how i know so much of the intimate details of things and mine and my wife and family and but also of each one of us and here in this church and what you do for us worldwide god you are so good lord we could maybe just have to wait till we get to the other side to be able to express it yeah maybe you give us a different tongue maybe give us a different language something lord that we can worship you with greater than at least something that comes close to matching what is in our hearts lord yes but lord we're so thankful today for your grace and your mercy your blessings your love your unmerited favor lord that has been said today your unmerited favor that is so important and means so much to us it's nothing we've done or ever could do but god is what you've done for us lord we just thank you father for your word we thank you for this message of the hour we thank you for revealing to us lord these things in here god that we could see and know that become a part of us that that we become it becomes us lord and us and the word are one as you and i are one as you and the father are one we're all one together lord god we celebrate this time of thanksgiving lord and god i do enjoy my family getting together and the wonderful food and the blessings that you give to us lord god we just thank you today father for all that you do may your word not return void but strengthen us by it lord it draws closer to you from it and we give you the thanks and the praise for all that is said and done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen in job chapter 1 verse 20. then job arose rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return to the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord amen in all this job sin not nor charged god foolishly you could be seated if you like try not to be too long but again uh something that came on my heart to give to you today and in retrospect and of course in in respect of what brother angel had said to about taking account of of the things that we look at and we say that we continue consider maybe a catastrophe or something that was an obstacle or or maybe even a death but god as he does make sure that we look at and see the the picture that god is painting for us and not just a tunnel vision of one event because god lets all these things happen and of course they all happen together for our good and our good to do our part for him so it's the good and the bad because job is sitting here and job is in the middle and you all know the story there's four messengers that had just come to job basically informing job that he had lost everything he had except his wife and a couple servants right everything animals are gone children are gone building's gone most of the servants gone we're all gone in in the space of a half hour or less that's right we don't know but we do know that as one servant came and told him you've lost all this before that servant could finish what he was saying the next servant came and said you've lost all this and before that servant could finish talking the next servant came four of them just like that one after the other job had lost everything and yet job in the middle of all that fell down to the ground uh well he says he rose rent his man shaved his head then fell down upon the ground and he worshipped he worshipped god he gave god praise he thanked god he said god you gave that to me you gave that child to me you gave that animal to me you gave that building to me you gave all this all these blessings you gave it to me lord so what you give to me belongs to you amen i'm just a steward of what god's doing in this life not just to steward i'm just trying to take care of it for him because it all belongs to him you know you you know me i don't i don't talk about money but you know it it comes to the point that scripturally it's true we are just stewards financially monetarily spiritually we are stewards of what belongs to god amen it's not ours to begin with god asks 10 to come back that there's food in his house but it all belongs to him colonel sanders gave 90 but it all belongs to him so everything we've got is his we're just stewards of it so job recognizing this says god you gave it all to me it all belongs to you blessed be the name of the lord amen he bowed down and he worshiped he thanked god he didn't just thank god as angel said he didn't just thank god for all the uh uplifting blessing things that we consider blessings of the monetary and the but he thanked god for the things that happened that god took from him amen you gave and you took away praise you lord follow me god bless you thank you lord i love you lord jesus see and so it wasn't just what god gave he thanked god for what god took away there's a reason why god does that there's a reason why god does everything that he does if we trust him and believe it there's a reason why he does everything that he does for us that's why job worshipped god he give thanks to god and all this he didn't charge god foolishly because he knew that where he stood god was taking care of that for him right now every day as we said should be a thanksgiving to the lord but there's obviously this time that we have that's been set aside that we tank account and even as you mull over the testimonies you gave and you think about them and how powerful they were and you know and i may know some of the inner workings of some of them and and i know how even more supernatural some of these testimonies are than maybe some of you might know some of you might not realize how powerfully supernatural some of the testimonies we heard here today are right if not all of them i don't say some all of them are just because of how god is working and making everything work together see so those things that i know of but even in your mind now taking account of the things that god has done for us right where he's brought us how he's protected us how he's kept us i hear over and over and over again when you listen to people talking or you see a newspaper or news or something and people are saying can't this year just be over friend i'll never wish away my life amen when i was a kid i always talked about wanting to be older my dad said don't you ever wish away your life and that stuck with me and i've made that a principle of my life my whole life you might be in the middle of the darkest time of your life but don't ever wish your life away life is precious to god and for us to want to wish away that life is contrary to what god gave it to you god gave it to us to serve him with and to worship him with and and to do everything that we have in our strength to to obey him and be led by his spirit every moment every second of every day that god give us and people are out there saying oh this has been a horrible year friend this has been a wonderful year this has been a great year god has blessed us so much amen we can see the can i say the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel i i i believe we can anyway right and we can see all the things it's shaping up and all the things that's going on around us i turned off the camera the first service that we had back together at the whole at the holiday inn i turned the cameras off and i told you exactly what god told me when i was praying the other more that morning before it's been six eight months ago maybe not six maybe six months ago the first service we had back at the holiday i might turn the camera off i told you because because the lord warned me not to put it on camera i didn't do it but if you remember that and you remember what i said it didn't come from me i was just the messenger uh every bit of it's coming to pass every bit of is exactly what he said and exactly what's taking place now and you see it happening it's all unfolding and it's it's just the point of of us in retrospect and looking back and taking account uh of how god's been good to us and how of how god has blessed us so much you know god is blessed and and kept each one of us in his own uh uh will and its own pleasure and it's that time that it's that reflection of of why thanksgiving started and thanking god for the harvest and the bountiful harvest that he had given them that they took that moment of thanksgiving and they looked back at everything that god had done again through some of the hardships through some of the deaths through some of the struggles but yet god's still blessed and kept and watched over and protected amen oh and he does to his own he always does that's that reflection that's why i actually got this title to take account to look back and reflect and thank god you've been so good to us there's a couple of points of this worship of this thanksgiving of this praising the lord that we've done this morning that that i want to look into now in deuteronomy chapter 16 verse 10 i've got a few scriptures i want to read but i won't uh elaborate on them greatly but deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 10. now we're talking about the feast days and the passovers and the uh and the the feast days but just this one simple verse deuteronomy 16 10 thou shalt keep the feast of the weeks unto the lord thy god with a tribute of a free will offering at thine hand okay so it's coming from your hand amen you worked to obtain it through the blessings of god of course but that's that's the acknowledgement of course right that we have we acknowledge god even though we worked for it it came from god amen there's nothing we could do with it if it had been for god you know brother dennis is talking about uh you know his back and um somebody mentioned their arm who who was it that said something about having trouble with their arm um was it leah's shoulder was it that's right it was leah's that's right because i've been having the same issue in this shoulder here and friday afternoon i come home and my back was hurting so bad every once in a while my back will flare up like that me and brother roger work pretty hard this week job we do is it's it's pretty physical job and i was up in an attic for about four hours been over and walking around raptors it's a physical job anyway and friday afternoon when we were finishing up my back got to hurting and i really didn't do anything after that set in the chair and try to stretch it and things like that but when when that thing happened it made me think but but but god blessed to be able to to do to do what we do and to do what needed to be done and god bless it to that point and you see that that this is that tribute what what this feast that god is asking of is the acknowledgement that we have to him for what he's done for us amen because it says the feast of the weeks unto the lord thy god with a tribute amen and i'm i'm going to say that's what we're doing here today is the tribute that we gave your testimonies uh the reading of the word the message this is all tribute to the lord jesus of a free will offering of thine hand so you give it but you give it of your own free will amen that's what god wants that's what god looks to god doesn't want to make you or force you to do anything right amen god's not gonna force your hand god's got not gonna make you do anything i mean one reason and i'll get back to this but one the biggest reason that we just have a box in the church is because that's what the bible says that's the number one because that's the bible says there's a box in the church that's what it says in the in the scripture that's what brother brown said brother brown said at one point it didn't work so they passed the plate it has the plate people feel a little uh funny about passing and not putting something that that's not what it's about to me right that's not what to me what it means is this free will offering and that free will offering that's a monetary example of a spiritual event the spiritual event that takes place is that you're giving thanks to god for his blessings to you you're giving thanks and worshiping god of your own free will yes it came from the work of your hand yeah your arm might hurt your back might hurt but it come from your from your own free will that you give unto the lord that you bless the lord with what god has blessed you with and you do it from your heart not because you have to not because you're obligated to not because you're begrudging to not because a plate was passed in front of you or or because somebody forced you to stand up and say something no no it's your own free will amen we're free moral agents and god wants this offering to be something of a free will of our own desire of our hearts desire and love for the lord that's where he wants our service to come from that's where he wants our love to come from that's where he wants our life to be is in his hands freely i offer to you freely lord not take it because i don't want you to but i want you to i'm giving it to you lord it belongs to you and this is that tribute see the feast of the weeks with a tribute of a free will offering not something mandated not something you have or forced to do but you do it from your heart you do it because you love him you do it because it's an acknowledgement of how good he has been to us and as we give back to the lord god blesses us even more bountifully amen you see how great the testimonies are going to come back to you just the testimonies that you gave today see how god blesses that testimony and brings it back to you amen because god will return to you tenfold a hundred fold of what you gave amen just the fruit of your lips and acknowledging the lord jesus and the blessings he done you see if god don't increase that right god don't continue to bless that and multiply that in your life and your family's lives amen you gave it of your own free will of your own hand which thou shalt give unto the lord thy god according as the lord thy god has blessed thee according as he has blessed thee that's where testimony come from our testimony comes from our hearts of our own free will as god has blessed you as god has blessed you you give to him you say lord god thank you now that being said it's pretty challenging if not completely impossible to give back to the lord anywhere close to what he does for us right amen amen but we do the best we can with what limited resources we have and what limited verbiage which i've already told you we have we do the best we can to give back to the lord your testimonies we're a part of that your worship and your praise is a part of that the songs we sang the music that was played the worship that we offer to the lord as of our own free will amen we sing songs to work to glorify god hallelujah returns back amen he inhabits of the worship of his people why why does god inhabit the worship of his people why does he show up when you start talking about it why does the spirit fall when you start testifying and you start witnessing about him when you mention the name jesus why does he come on the scene because of your acknowledgement because of your voice and of giving out he is blessing that by bringing it back to you and multiplying it in your life amen amen praise the lord do you see what i'm talking about you know you can turn on television whatever you see the other televangelists it's all about money to them it ain't all about money friend that's the smallest little miniscule thing on the totem pole students are the ones that make it the big thing right humans make it all every i remember one time a brother now you can agree with it or not but there was a uh this is probably 40 years ago in north carolina there was a brother a a pastor baptizing people and his brother was coming in to be baptized and he said oh hold on a second pastor and he started to take his wallet out and he said no sir brother leave that in there too we're going to baptize that too i thought well okay you know and everybody thought that was wonderful just worship and praise the lord and uh maybe he's got a point there i don't know but that's the most minisculest part of this amen what else and everything that god does and returning back to you when you acknowledge god before others how god returns that back to you when you testify to unbelievers uh when you've prayed for your family when when you uh uh give unto the lord and and i'm not talking about money you come to church when you're sitting here together when you put forth the effort to be here and and to come together and you see that god don't return that right that's right amen he does and he does it of your because you gave of your own free will according as god has blessed you amen according as god has blessed you i see that of course that again until we go back to tithe and offering because that's exactly as god has blessed you then that's how you bless back to the lord amen as god as you have talked and expressed your uh feeling and your testimony to the lord that's how god has blessed you and will continue to bless you you acknowledge it and you bring it forth god comes on the scene amen he multiplies it he he he blesses it that's why i believe that we see the things that's happening in our lives that we see the things that's happening in our family's lives as we said last week with all the turmoil and everything that's going on around this country and and the political unrest and the the financial unrest and uh i i saw something the other day where they had a uh a food bank and uh and my friends the the cars were lined up a mile deep to try to get to a food bank to get food has anybody's tables been empty but i guarantee you they're not because god's blessed you amen amen have you had to worry about getting to a food bank not lately amen god has blessed you because you see what's happening in the middle of everything that's going on god is still god has been and is always faithful yes he is amen amen he might not always have the uh the the words to say it the way we want to but it's still god understands and again god knows our heart too uh leviticus 22 29. let me move on here it says and when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the lord offer it at your own will amen offer it at your own will god loves the bible says god loves a cheerful giver right now of course we all make all the time make that about money that he just to me that ain't just about money friend that's giving of yourself that's giving of your time right that's giving of your acknowledgement that you that you speak and you actually lay forth what your praise and worship is and how god has been good and how you tell other people about it that that means that that's a giver that's somebody that's giving of themselves you help other people and you're there for other people that's giving of yourself god loves a cheerful giver not someone that does it begrudgingly oh could you do this well i really don't want to well you know just stay home then right true i mean you could be a nice couple of strong arms or strong mind or whatever the situation is but you know if you don't want to do it just don't do it that's right amen but that's the kind of person that doesn't get blessed right the person that gets blessed is someone who is a cheerful giver someone who comes up and says look you know brother i can't do a whole lot and i don't have a whole lot but what i can do you ask me and i'll be there for you amen now see that that's a cheerful giver these three brothers right here angel angel and ernesto were in this church putting down carpet painting walls and doing what they could do if i had other brothers like brother dennis once come to me and say you know i i can't do a whole lot have physical limitations but brother for something i can do just tell me god blesses that friend amen i understand god will bless you for that even if you don't lift a finger even if there's nothing you end up being able to do right god blesses us for that amen everything that we give to him we do it of our own free will praise the lord from our heart we do it because we love god and we love his children amen we love it because we we're thankful to have a place to worship amen i'm thankful to have this place of worship yes amen but you know we live in this world and and and it's not free and it didn't happen this way because we snapped our fingers there's a lot of work that went into it a lot of cleaning that went into it a lot of a lot of labor and a lot of money it went into making this what it was and we either appreciate it or we don't it's right and i believe we do amen because god provided it and god honored the free will offering we give to the lord hallelujah you can't out give god amen no way amen you can't outgive god no man it's don't don't matter i've heard people tell me before oh they gave too much you can't not if you're giving it to the lord amen amen now if you put something in the box just because you think you're giving it to me you're wrong right that's right right amen that's the lord's yes whatever you do here at this church you say i'll do this for the pastor no no no no you don't do it for me you do it for the lord praise god i i do it that way amen i'm of course now obviously as we serve one another we're serving god it's true of course i'm not negating that point but i don't i do this for the lord me and brother roger have those conversations many times and the things that's been gone into this we didn't do this for me or for him for you we did it for the lord amen god blesses it because of that god blesses our lives amen you're a part of that every one of you here is a part of that amen amen because you give of your own free will that's why god blesses it now the second part i want to get to this thanksgiving that you gave is in the thanksgiving that we have is of our own free will we did it because we wanted to we did it because it was in our heart too the other thing we need to do with our thanksgiving and our worship let's go to genesis chapter 4. maybe eventually i'm still a little up in the air about this one we'll start putting the scriptures up on the screen but i will say if you're streaming if you're here i i don't ever want us to get to the place that we don't bring our bibles to church amen okay i don't i don't see any way to go into battle without a weapon amen that's true and we come here and we come into battle you need a sword and i i if we ever do start putting them up there which we we might do probably will i don't want you not to bring your bibles to church amen i know amen we started doing that to tabernacle and everybody quit bringing their bibles to church everybody's walking out of church without anything in their hands yeah and and i thought i just i'm sorry that's just how i feel i'm not saying that anybody's wrong or right or wrong or going to hell or unsaved none of that just it's just it's just my quirky thing i i just an old school uh if you bring a tablet or a phone okay but i just like this right here amen i just don't think they'll ever be a substitute for this uh i've been asked and uh why i didn't and things that i i still write my sermons down on pads he's why don't you use a tablet i mean they're not that expensive blah blah it doesn't have anything to do with price i've never owned a tablet micah gave us me and sonya won i used it for a little bit but she has it now and i i just never used it it's just i i don't know old dog new trick thing i don't know i just it's just you just can't substitute that to me it's not going to substitute this bible by a phone by a tablet by a screen you're just not going to substitute it but amen anyway maybe lord willing one time we'll get we'll we'll make start putting them up there a little update for you uh lord willem we're gonna have a sound system next week uh that we don't want it to be too loud but we've had some uh some feedback that maybe the piano gets a little difficult to hear or the song the singing when we're all singing and worshiping even though it's a small building so lord willing we're gonna have try to get a sound system hopefully we'll have it by next sunday that we can have a sound service brother roger's buying some cameras to do the streaming with and a sound board for the uh for the cameras and everything so anyway we still got work that we're doing uh so appreciate your prayers about that and uh and again it's not without effort and finances to do it all yes so uh we're very thankful for that but the lord lord willem we'll we'll we'll see where it goes from there but genesis chapter four verse one this is the second point that i wanted to get across to you before we close here now and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i've gotten a man from the lord and she and that was the part that guy had got to me the other day about he brought it up i didn't bring it up you know what scientifically proven that that a woman can have twins and and have a two different babies from two different men i said yeah did you just say that i've never run into another human to actually say that who they when they instigated the conversation i said absolutely i said you don't think it was an apple do you anyway we we had to stop but lord willing we're supposed to go back to that house and do some more work and she again bear his brother abel abel was the keeper of the sheep but cain was the tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that cain bought brought the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord offering unto the lord that was the that was what the increase that he had gotten from the labor of his hand and abel also brought of the firstings of the flock and the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel in his offering but undercain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very wrought and his countenance fell now the difference between the two sacrifices the difference between the two offerings now brother graham tells us all the things was set up right altar and all the semantics and all the the practice of it was done the same uh their heart was there and they were giving it of their own free will and and and and they were doing it that way but the one thing that cain's sacrifice lacked was revelation uh you can go to hebrews 11 8 and it tells you that by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice we know faith is revelation so by revelation abel offered to god a more excellent sacrifice cain's sacrifice was refused by god so what tells us god does not accept just any worship right the worship that we give to god has should be by our free will but it needs to come by revelation we need to know why we're worshiping who we're worshiping we're not worshiping a father over here and a and a son in the middle and a holy ghost over here or one big one in the middle and two or three over here where we gotta know who we're worshiping we got to know in what way that we worship the lord we don't come to worship the lord by our attitudes and our thoughts we come to worship him in the way the word tells us to worship him by revelation by truth those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen amen there's a spirit it's his holy spirit there's a truth and then it's this bible amen we worship him in the mechanics and the dynamics hallelujah that's how our worship comes that can only come by revelation right the mechanics can only come in the in the context that is supposed to come by revelation amen people have a head knowledge of it you see churches around the world they worship their hands up tears flowing mascara is running and they're worshiping god hallelujah sorry i don't mean to be cynical about that but it's true amen that's right but and they're worshiping god but where is the where's the revelation behind it where's the truth there's a dynamic there but where's the mechanic amen where's the truth of it see there's there's the the the dynamic the the free will that we give to the lord there's got to be a mechanic behind it there's got to be a truth to it there's got to be a revelation behind it or it is not accepted by god amen even in isaiah isaiah rebuked the people because they were bringing their sacrifice and doing everything that the that god had commanded them to do but it became a stink in god's nostrils their worship became a stink in god's nostrils because it became just a formality to them that's right amen it just became something that they did it wasn't from the heart anymore it wasn't something that was the desire that they wanted to do it became a drudgery for them it became something they that was that was a hardship and they didn't want to do it and it was just a formality so what would just take the lamb and go cut his throat you know we're done done and and it was it became a sting to god amen that's the same thing friend if our worship doesn't come with revelation if our worship doesn't come by truth of the word and the spirit of the word then god doesn't accept it i'm sorry people say that was it well how could god not accept them standing with their hands up in their tears and all because the bible says so amen and i don't care how many theologians you can come say oh god's got to accept that no he doesn't right god accepts who he does and rejects who he wants amen that's his sovereignty amen that's up to god to do he saw he loved jacob he loved esau he hated for either boy was born you tell me god was wrong in that god's sovereign he can do whatever he wants to do praise god i'm not going to try to lecture him on it amen i want to go spend eternity with him amen amen worship our worship must be by mechanics dynamics our worship must be our thanksgiving must be with revelation it must be with truth it must be according to the word not by my oh well i'll i'll give god what i want to give him i'll give him the time i want to give him now you give him what you a lot of times the hardest thing to do is to give is to give unto the lord right amen and people amen have a hard time understanding that accepting if you don't have god in you you won't do it right but it's got to be by revelation you've got to be of your own free will and it's got to be by revelation right worship with revelation can't be just um of what you you want to approach him as so i'll just approach god the way i want to no god won't accept that right amen i'll just do it the way i want to do it well that's fine but god's not going to accept it tears flow and the emotions are there but god doesn't accept it right amen people are going to come to jesus on that day and say oh did we not do this this in your name he said department he'll say depart from me you working near workers of iniquity i never knew you right that's right never knew oh but we did this lord oh we we talked about this we had church we worshiped you we went to the prisons we fed the hungry we did all these things in your name and he says but i never knew you right because it wasn't done according to the word amen revelation wasn't done by truth it was done just because they uh wanted to look good or wanted to have more members or something of that effect but it's got to be something that god that we give unto the lord and amen and freely by revelation a couple of scriptures psalms 100 make a
