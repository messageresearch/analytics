sleep but thankful he gives us Grace amen gives us strength to continue to press this battle amen prise the Lord Jesus let's go over turn in the Bible to uh 2 Corinthians chapter 10 amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10 we're going to pick up where we left off a couple of weeks ago on the Gateway mind amen we had our Mother's Day last week so um we will start back with the scripture we uh had last week 2 Corinthians chapter 10 uh we'll begin with verse one 2 Corinthians 10 verse 1 but before we read the word we bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're so very thankful father again the blessings the love the grace that you give Lord just an unworthy people father as we are God but it's the blood that you shed at Calvary that makes us worthy it's your presence in our lives it's your spirit within us Lord that that you taking our place helps us allows us to be able to take your place being robed in your righteousness Lord yes as a human father we are nothing God but in you we are everything we thank you Lord for Watching Over Us strengthening us blessing us keeping us Lord when everything else and all the the tornadoes of Life swirl around us God you continue to bless us and keep us in your hands yes how blessed we are how thankful we are Lord your great your mercy Lord so Bountiful father that an unmar favor God that we receive from you is is such beyond words of what it means to us God in our lives the Assurance the Blessed Assurance to know that by faith we live God to trust you that you make all things work together for our good because we love you amen the Bible doesn't say you make all things work together because you you love us it says because we love you we thank you Lord because from our hearts that unconditional love returns back to you God because you first love us yes thank you God for this Grace thank you for this word thank you Lord for the blessings of being able to have service here again today and the desire in our hearts to be in the house of God we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you Lord Jesus would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here today we commit it to your hand thank thank you Lord for those that are come that are here today thank you those that may be streaming Lord we just bless your Holy Name Jesus and commit the remaining part of the service now into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen second Corinthians chapter 10 uh verse 1 2 Corinthians 10:1 now I Paul uh myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who is who in presence and base among you but being absent and and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walk according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of Satan's strongholds I know it doesn't say say tonight add that of course not adding to the word but that's the stronghold it's talking about amen casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringeth into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ Christ the word and having in a Readiness to Revenge uh Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled you could be seated if you'd like I like the way that Paul starts this reading as uh we'll delve back just a little bit as he talks about the thankfulness of God in his life he talks about the humility how we are bold in the Lord but yet how we are humble before the Lord amen base means if you look at the word says present and base among you that just means loneliness that just means humility amen and in the humility and the loneliness of heart as we do amen towards one another and of course before the Lord coming not walking according to the flesh although we walk in the flesh we don't walk according to the flesh because we walk by faith we don't walk by flesh we don't walk by sight we walk by faith amen amen our spiritual walk of our spiritual life is not a walk of sea taste F smell here it's not something that we have in our imagination cons reason memory it is a walk that we walk by faith amen because we live by faith that walk of the Walk of Faith brings us to understand that we walk in the flesh but we walk not after the flesh to war after the flesh because the weapons of that Warfare amen are Mighty through God Amen to the pulling down down the bringing down of strongholds now remember last time couple of weeks ago what did we talk about was Satan's stronghold where is the stronghold that Satan uses what did Satan choose in the Garden of Eden what was his desired way to get to the individual the mind yes amen that was his chosen way brother said that was his chosen the Garden of Eden Satan chose the mind and God chose the heart it's the it's the mind the Gateway that he uses to try to get to each one of us through the mind the Gateway pulling down that stronghold that he uses now Satan uses those inlets into our body into our spirit to influence that mind to influence that Gateway because he knows that what you feel goes straight to your mind he knows what you see goes straight to your mind he knows what you uh uh imagine goes straight to your mind and that mind is the womb to the spirit to try to get down to actually bringing to pass the actual thought that you may have now it may it it it uh speaking of course on those thoughts the thoughts of the enemy those thoughts of the enemy are to be brought captive we talked about last time to bring captive to The Obedience of the word if it's a thought or something that's contrary to the word now first you must know what the scripture says if you don't you don't know what the scripture says how can you obey it amen it's like going down the the the the road here at 80 mil an hour and the cop stops you and says I'm going to give you a ticket because you're going 8 and 45 and you look and you go all the way down that road and there's not one single sign that tells you the speed limit is 45 that man cannot give you a ticket because there's nothing established if there's nothing established in the law no sign if there's nothing that tells you that it's 45 then you don't have to go 45 the cop can stop you all day long and say hey you're breaking the law what law there is no law it's not a law unless you tell me it's not a law unless I know that that what it says it tells me that the law is I can only go a certain speed it's not a law unless it says on the books it's a law then then what good does it do see if you don't know what the word says how can you know to obey it right if you don't know what the law is out on the street here how do you know to obey it amen you must know the law brother brother Dennis talked about obedience better than sacrifice absolutely but you have to know what to obey yes Who Who Are You obeying amen obey the word the word is what we are supposed to scriptures what we're supposed to know to have in in yes in our intellect in our knowledge yes yes but first in the soul amen because Christ is the word first in your soul now the thought that comes if it's a thought that's something contrary to to the word then you cast it down you bring it captive we talked about the computer last time you Captivate it like a like a virus in a computer you Captivate it and you hit delete so that that thought doesn't come drop down into your spirit and become real in your life and you act upon something that you should not be thinking about in the first place probably the devil's thought in the first place probably wasn't even your thought but the devil will try to convince you that it was your thought right but see he has he has access to be able to drop that into your mind amen he has access to be able to do it through the things that you see that's why we have to be careful about the things that we look at we talked about brother brandom in the cross last time amen we all know that story he also uses touch feel he uses imagination in your spirit he uses your imagination and your reasoning your conscience he uses those things to try to contact through your brain through your mind to drop down in your heart so that you start acting on things that you know are contrary to the word that's why we're to cast down cast down imagination cast down reasonings oh well it'll be okay God won't mind this is it against his word then he will mind it amen he didn't put it in there just to fill in space right God didn't write things in this in this word just to try to make it this thick he he didn't do it just to try to make sure there's uh 66 books in the Bible and and all the chapters and all he didn't do it just to fill space he did it because it's his work he did it because it came from him this is God's intellectual property like we've talked about before God's intellectual property there's laws in this country about someone's intellectual property if someone if something belongs to someone even a phrase a word uh a book written or something or a song lyrics it becomes that person's intellectual property and if someone tries to come and disseminate that and repeat it or sing it or whatever without permission of that person that's against the law you can't do that this is God's intellectual property it is him in letter form amen so that is we to come obedient to that word every thought every thought captive remember last time we talked about uh science even says 17 seconds thought comes you have 17 seconds to decide are you going to act upon that thought are you going to cast that thought out are you going to agree with that thought are you going to disagree with that thought or you going to uh do away with that thought 17 seconds amen but I believe if something comes immediately you know I you Christians know well enough you know the word well enough to know immediately if it's something against God's word you cast it down amen amen yes or you find yourself in the next 10 15 minutes doing that thing that Satan persuaded you in your mind to do amen it dropped down in your heart when it dropped down in your heart then it became something that you acted upon amen you act upon it at that point and that's when it becomes a danger that's when it becomes a disastrous look here now in the mind look at this the patmas vision excuse me got up every morning in Florida it was 99% humidity get up here and it's 9 so I'm a little dry today uh the humidity wasn't fun to work in but uh I didn't have to put on any lotion I had to put it on lip balm um it it was it was very wet but now it's kind of dry today so I probably reach for the water bottle a little more so please forgive me but let's look at this quot Now voice of many Waters fourth personage of him the voice of God voice of many Waters he knows we know that brother said that's the ministry preaching bringing out the word called it the fourth personage of him amen his voice speaking when a when when a real true gifted by God uh called uh a person brings that word it's it's God speaking because it's God working through his gift just like we just like we agree and believe that someone gifted uh by the anointing of the Holy Spirit speaks in tongues or prophesies or something we take that prophecy a gift from God of God speaking through that person we take that word as from God Amen that's what that's what prophecy is that's what prophecy should be that's what it is amen when God's operating that gift is it's God's voice it's God's voice speaking amen the fourth personage of him voice of many Waters how are you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when the voice re uh tonight is recorded your voice is recorded your thoughts are recorded as a man thinketh in his heart so is he notice now I'm going to read this very familiar quote that we know notice now he says your thoughts are louder speak louder in heaven than your voice does on the earth amen your thoughts speak louder in heaven now brother green always used to say your your thoughts speak louder Before the Throne of God than do your words but I'm just reading this quote here uh your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is here on the earth mine amen that's pretty powerful people say I watch what I say of course we should we should temper our temper our words absolutely we should be in Mastery control of what we say sometimes uh that's probably not always true but we should amen especially as Christians always have uh have control over our mouths have control over our voices have control over what we say but remember remember your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words even do here on Earth so what does that mean that means that we need to be very careful of the things that we think and when those things that s May Satan may drop into your mind cast it downen that's why the scripture says cast it down bring it captive to The Obedience of the word don't let it materialize don't entertain it don't let it become something that perverts then your mind your body your spirit because it will amen absolutely that's the whole point that he has to bring it forth for is so that it perverts you it perverts your body if you do something if you act upon something you know you should not do amen and the type of living and whatnot uh would destroy the body we're going to read about that in just a few minutes we're going to read a couple of scriptures where that actually happened in the body it will it will corrupt your mind because the mind is flesh and it is corruptible amen it'll corrupt your spirit it'll corrupt the things that we know that uh brings contact to God that's why we are to bring every thought because those thoughts speak louder before God than your words do here on Earth so being very careful of what our thoughts are our thoughts are very important controlling our thoughts are very important when those thoughts come in remember this is the Gateway the whole point of this message the whole the title of this message the Gateway it's the Gateway it's the is the way that brings it from out there into you to pervert or control over you amen amen look now let's look at this let's go over to Genesis I'm going to read I want to read a couple of examples Genesis chapter 3 two very contrasting minds and results Genesis chapter 3 know the stories very well obviously but recognizing the difference and the contrasting uh Minds thoughts here Genesis chapter 3:1 we know the scripture reading very well now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now he's already questioning God's word that's the first thing that the devil wants to try to put into your mind is questioning the authority of God's word right amen question the legitimacy and the accuracy of God's word yes it got millions of people today absolutely contrary to the word of God but remember without Revelation and only a carnal understanding it will never come to you a person an individual the way it the way that it will manifest and and uh uh replicate life it's got to comeon the way that it replicates life and the only way it can do is by Revelation not b not by intellect not by intelligence you can't go to some Seminary and learn you can learn all kinds of stuff but you can't learn God right amen uh uh I I think sometimes and I look around and this way that we live and this message that we believe it churches have become too messy amen I I'm not I'm not brother Bram did not come here to lead you to himself I am not here to lead you to him I am here to try to help you get to Jesus Christ not to him but to Christ the word amen we become so messy and it seems like there's so little Grace anymore with people in the message that they that they want to take it and hang it around your neck like a noose that was not the intended purpose when God brought it through a prophet yes amen it was the purpose was to bring that to bring that Christ real to you to make Christ real in your life to bring your relationship to him as close as any can be between spirit and flesh to bring that relationship as as brother B said Heaven and Earth embracing one another Heaven and Earth kissing Heaven and Earth brace embracing one another becoming one the invisible Union amen the invisible Union of the bride and the bridegroom Amen to bring the two together as one that's the whole point amen that's the reason it came not here to to to to get you to to a man but to Christ amen amen to Christ the word but so you see the first thing if he did this Tech now notice we could go over to Revelation 12 and done the same thing he done the same thing in the garden of En he did in Revelation 12 when he was in heaven when it very first started very first sin cast on on Earth he continued the same thing what was it denying God's word trying to get you to disbelieve God's word try to plant a seed just a seed it doesn't take a whole tree it doesn't take a whole Orchard it just takes one seed to try to sew one seed of doubt in you about whether God's word is valid or not whether God's word is real true or not whether he'll stand by his word or not just one here in the Garden of Eden he does the question did God really say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die now remember as we know scripturally that voice was not spoken directly to Eve to the woman that word came through her husband Adam you can go over to the curses and see that that's the truth because when God gave the curses down he didn't say anything to the woman about disobeying his word but he did say it about Adam he did tell Adam because you disobeyed what I told you this is what's going to happen he didn't tell her that amen because that word what she just quoted repeated to the devil was the serpent was the word that her husband Adam had told her still true it's still God's word no matter who says it it's still God's word it's like U it's like that story that uh uh that woman had run out of food and she was in her bedroom on her knees crying out to God with her Wom Open Lord just bring me just a loaf of bread God I need a loaf of bread uh I I've run out of food and I pray that you just bring me a loaf of bread and soon and before too long the doorbell rings and she opens the door and there's there's bread there and she starts worshiping and thanking God thank you Lord for the bread thank you for answering my prayers these little boys had went and bought the bread and put it on her doorstep and hid in the bushes to make fun of her and she was celebrating and worshiping and praising God for the bread they come out of the Bush say lady God didn't give you that bread we went down and bought that bread for you she said God if you got to use two Little Devils to bring me bread thank you for the bread amen no matter who says it if it's the word it's the word amen no matter who brings it it's still true yes amen it's still right it's still God's word so yeah she was repeating it to the devil and yet it was still God's word even though she just repeated what Adam said but now the serpent found a found a crack in her testimony and he says and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil just one word just Twisted one word amen surely you'll die was God's word surely you'll not die was Satan's word amen amen which word came true amen God's word is still true God's word is still right God's word is still forever settled in heaven and can never fail God's word amen but she listened to the devil but remember where is the first place that it took place now I talked about uh the the I talked about the F but this was words words that the that the serpent said to her that came into her oratory that went into her mind it came into her mind through her ear amen then she saw lustfully with her eye that came into her mind remember before the act that happened there could ever take place it had to infiltrate the womb of her mind it had to come and be accepted and be received into the womb of her mind that God's word is not correct that God's word is not right and I I'll believe what this person says says instead of what God says and she first had to entertain and make a determination in her mind in that few brief seconds of what she was going to do she had to make up her mind she's free moral agent she could do whatever she wanted to do it was her choice same thing today Saints we are free moral agents to do whatever you want to do it is is your choice yes amen it is your choice it was her choice and she chose to believe the serpent instead of God and when that thing was entertained in her mind and look what it said when the woman saw now she first heard it and it embedded itself in her mind that Battleground that Gateway that place that that as entertained led to an actual act taking place cuz then she saw the woman saw that the tree was good for food amen she saw it then these entryways that the devil uses to try to deceive you Saints to try to cause you to do things that you know are contrary to God's word these inlets that he uses to manipulate your mind mind into accepting and receiving that thought that idea that way and before the ACT could ever take place it had to First be received into the womb of her mind right amen amen before she ever received a seed in her literal womb she received received the seed into her mind and notice what was it that we recognized as the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's receiving the Holy Spirit told the prophet it's receiving the word for your day yes it's receiving the word amen not just hearing it not just believing it but receiving the word what does that mean that means that becomes who you are yes you receive it into yourself yes amen we've all heard the phrase you are what you eat uh that that's true in the natural sense it's true in the spiritual sense you become what you ingest and to receive it you become it now just to believe it that's okay I mean I can believe that Godzilla exists but that doesn't mean I'm going to receive that amen I I I can say I believe that uh some astronomical thing but that doesn't make it right that doesn't make it real that doesn't mean that's what it becomes or who I become amen I might can believe something that doesn't make it right even though you believe doesn't mean you've taken it into yourself amen I receive it as I become it she received it and it became her she acted upon it so before she ever received a literal physical seed in her natural physical womb she had to receive the seed in her mind in her uh spiritual womb she had to receive it here before she ever received it here yes amen she saw that the tree was tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did eat first had to come in the mine before it actually took place the eyes of them uh the eyes of them both were open they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves Together made themselves aers now if that was an apple then we need to pass the apples because people walking around naked everywhere amen amen that's truth yes especially in tuon Arizona summertime people be walking all over down the streets with no clothes on yes or a stitch here and a stitch there I W say no clothes I mean basically we see it we doesn't look like much to us uh things hanging out or they're so tight they look like a skin down weener and bulges here and humps there and it's not comely it's not godly amen and elicits a uh just to look on that elicits a lustful thought which is the whole point the devil's trying to get yes to listen a lustful thought in your mind yes amen from the nakedness it's apicot let's get them apricots out and let's pass them by the millions because we need them amen but it wasn't that and we know they found out that they were naked because of the act that took place amen amen the womb That Was Then received seed from first the serpent then from Adam but it had to come here first amen and it has to come to us first remember I told you it can change your physical being you can act upon something that is a thought that comes in your mind act upon it physically that it changes your physical being amen amen it changed her physical being because she begin to grow in this area amen it'll change your physical being by doing things you know you shouldn't do going places you know you shouldn't go and listen the words that you speak we to say things that you should not say and look other people say things that come in your mind and you cast it down when you say it and it comes from your voice and your ears hear it and your mind processes it in your body knows that you spoke it and it affects your body it affects the chemistry of your body it affects the spirit part of your body affects it affects everything about you amen amen it has that effect on you we don't understand how powerful it is you remember when uh maybe maybe I should do it again uh at the Tabernacle many years ago I did the rice experiment where I had the two jars of rice and uh and I I actually wrote Love on the out I wrote Love if y'all don't remember I wrote Love on the piece of paper and I taped it to that jar of rice so that the rice could read it I didn't put it on there where you could read it from the outside but so that it could be read from the inside and I put hate on the other one and I just left them there I put they were the same room they were apart from each other but they were in the same room same condition same every absolutely everything about it was 100% the same within 30 days one was just rot and nasty and the other one's still just as white as could be the love rice was still almost looked atable of sitting on a shelf for a month still almost looked atable the other was so nasty and black just from the word hate didn't say anything can rice read I don't know but I know the power of those of of that of the spirit realm Saints of of those things are so very powerful just don't understand what effect because we don't a lot of times we don't feel an immed immediate effect of something adversely in our condition in our bodies Minds whatever we don't think much about it amen but it has an effect on us and it comes from the things that that drop into our minds that that we that we entertain that takes over us that changes the the structure of our our body Spirit Soul everything about us it has an adverse effect it's very important to understand the controlling to bring every thought every negative thought Satan is out there to do nothing to you but to defeat you Amen to scare you yes to make you worry about everything to try to defeat you down so that your spirit is so beaten up that you don't even feel like yourself anymore that's the tactics that comes into your mind the devil's playing with your mind but God owns your soul amen and that's one thing the devil cannot touch you just use that the spirit of God to deflect that devil get thee behind me Satan amen boo devil yes amen that devil must go by the authority of God in you praise the Lord now look one story in the mind the womb first the seed dropped in the mind first before it ever receiv receives seed in the womb in the physical womb let's go to another story let's go over to St Luke chap 1 St Luke chapter 1 we'll read beginning with verse 26 St Luke 126 in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou are thou that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at this saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be where did it first get entertained in Mary well the Bible right here says and cast in her mind in her mind what manner of salutation this should be amen and the angel again through the ears auditory into the mind she she she uh cast it in her mind what matter of salutation now and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou H has found favor with God praise the Lord and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus in her womb physical but where did she first casted to the understanding of what this Angel was saying in her mind amen exact same thing is the serpent came to Eve this Angel Gabriel came to Mary and cast in her mind salutations now the similarities they were both women amen similarities they both were free moral agents to choose what they wanted to do it was their decision it was Eve's decision the woman at that time decision to decide which way she was going to go this also is Mary's decision it is her choice in her mind now she is reasoning it in her mind casting it in her mind amen that is is this something that's real well when you cast something in your mind what do you do you look back at the scripture there something you say whether you're not sure whether or not this is something of scripture or not I imagine in Mary's mind especially being a spouse of Joseph son of David in the lineage of David I imagine in her mind she looked back in this at this salutation she looked back in her mind through the scripture and found where Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and when she found that in her mind as she was reasoning this salutation in her mind she found that scripture that word that said that a virgin shall conceive in her mind she received it praise God in her mind the seed took place because she looked back and said this is the word this is scripture I believe it amen I receive it praise God let's look here angel said fear not Mary for thou H has found favor with God behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb bring forth the son and call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob o forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then Mary said unto the angel how uh how shall this be seeing that I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen can you imagine as that prophecy went forth from Isaiah that said a virgin shall conceived you imagine how many time we look back in retrospect we know amen but if you're back if you're listening to that prophecy and you're looking forward you thinking how in the world is a woman going to conceive knowing no man how is this going to happen how can this be so you can imagine her conation and trying to find out okay I look back I see in the scripture says Okay a virgin is going to conceive but she's got the angel right there and they said but how is this going to happen I I've never known a man how is this going to take place amen the Holy Ghost the angel answer said to her the Holy Ghost praise the Lord not the third person in a trinity but God himself in spirit form shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that this that Holy thing which uh which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she she ha also also conceived a son in her old age this is a six Monon with her child who is who was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible amen and Mary said amen behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word amen amen behold your hand made be it unto me according to your word hallelujah the word that came into her mind and dropped a seed then from the Holy Ghost came the seed of God into her womb and conceived the child that was born Christ Jesus hallelujah amen amen but it had to first come in her mind she had to receive it she had to receive the seed in this womb first before she could ever receive seed in this womb but as soon as she received word seed in this womb she was convinced of understanding how this is going to happen and don't tell me Saints don't tell me that none of you have asked God how or why amen because I know you be lying we have all asked God why before or how I understand but how is this going to happen I believe it but how is this going to be she was just a simple human and asking Lord I don't understand how is this going to happen and when the angel explained to her the spirit of God is going to come and overshadow you she said be it unto me according to that word praise the Lord you know what that meant I I I I was going to save this for a Christmas message probably still will but you know she signed her death warrant man yes she did she was an unmarried woman yes who is is who was with child I mean back then you were stoned dead if if adultery why it changed I don't know but anyway Grace um were caught in the act of adultery you were stoned dead I mean to be found with a child and not and not married I mean her and Joseph just were they they they just their lives were over as you would say there that people wouldn't want to have anything to do with them anymore because obviously naturally the outside world's going to say oh he got her pregnant they're not even married yet amen praise the Lord little did they know they don't realize God has a plan yes he God always has a plan and it doesn't always go and sometimes doesn't go as we plan sometimes that that plan goes into God's permissive will but God has a plan and he always brings that plan to pass and it always comes to work out for our good somehow he makes it work that way yes but she had to she had to receive it in her mind first in her mind her womb of her mind before it could ever be received into her natural womb amen had to be one place before it could be the other amen just like Eve but this was God's word now see Eve left God's word to receive what the serpent was saying Eve uh Mary conceived in her mind what it that it was God's word before she ever received it there's the difference amen and that's the difference that we look at today that's that's the difference that we that comes into our lives every day now is it something that is of god or is it something that is of the devil and and and you you should know well enough to know this is of the devil or this is you should be able to feel even in your if you're born again you should even be able to fill in your spirit whether this is God or not amen even if you don't know every single word that's written in this book you should know by the holy spirit that lives in you is this that this is God or not God right amen amen praise the Lord look here and now the smoke of words your original seed spoken words Original Seed seed seed now let's go that back now he said pick up again come down for something you remember last service last Sunday service he's talking about G to the soul he's referring back to the messages that I'm referring to the the greatest battle ever fought that he that he ministered you remember now there's a womb of the phys physical there's a womb of the spirit you believe that there's a spiritual womb physical womb and the mind the mind is the womb to the spirit now remember I told you last Sunday draw it out here before you these five senses he's talking about SE taste F smell here five senses on the spirit the conscience imagination affection reason memory in the in the spirit realm now on the left side there's only one and that's left on the basis of free moral agency to accept take take in free moral agency now to take in or to let out to receive it or to rejected as a free moral agent your choice amen see he says now see that's how adultery that's how adultery is committed spiritually yes it's how it's committed physically too but that's how spiritual adultery is committed when you knowing better of the word of God by the Intercourse of your mind taken alive the devil against the word of God that's exactly what Eve done with a spiritual intercourse first it come by believing Satan's light into the womb of her mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the natural act took place help us Lord the one leads to the other that led to the soul that's when the natural act and that's the only way that a woman ever can commit adultery against her husband is the first let the let some man talk her into it then receive another man that's not her husband that's committed adultery when the Bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made Creed dogmas take place in the word of God she is absolutely committing spiritual adultery yes did not Jesus say whoever lookth whoever lookth Upon a woman to love after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart yes look at the p a woman to lust after her had committed adultery with her already amen I remember when I was in business in Charlotte I had office big window Overlook the parking lot is beauty industry Barber industry of course so people come in and out all the time buying product and women would come in and they're you know wasn't they that's just I don't know the way to put it scantly scantly dressed is that a better way to say it I don't know uh they look like Redlight women anyway they come and park and there's guys in the office and they come and look and they're oing over and that I said you guys better be careful they said Look new I said uh no you guys better be careful I said the Bible says if you look on that woman to lust after her You' committed it in your heart already Yes amen honestly I be honest they turned their heads and didn't look again they didn't say another word they didn't they they didn't chide me or call me crazy or anything like that they actually turned their heads quit looking and didn't say anything else about it we just continued on with our business is that's the truth see amen Jesus said that that's the word of God look now in their minds already look at the upon a woman she let it come into the mind that's the W that starts the things moving the thing that starts the thing moving Satan coming in we were sowed with the word someday I'll bring back to life uh uh I'll bring the life into the Earth and multiply replenish your Earth what eeve what Eve failed to do Mary did praise God amen amen and we are just read the difference the contrasting Stark difference between the two amen what Eve failed to do Mary did she took the word eve took Satan's lie Mary took God's word and through Mary's seed replenishes the Earth again through the bride through the word will bring up in the will bring it up in the Millennium through that goes the word the word is planted into every predestinated heart praise God for that yes Spirit comes down and Waters it they cannot cannot cannot you cannot die amen I will raise him up again at the last day yes what is it the mind is the womb to the spirit yes to take in or to let out amen a little further down he goes on and says so what this was both physical and spiritual with Eve first at and and any and anytime not just Eve but anytime I told you asked you this morning sisters to forgive me sisters forgive me so I can mention that at the anytime that a woman takes the wrong step I'm talking about Christ and and the bride now but anytime a woman takes the wrong step she has to First receive it in her mind yes some Slicker has to persuade her and she listens to it against her own better judgment than the ACT then the ACT is committed right so first inity can be anything doesn't have to just be adultery we focused on that thing with even Mary today it doesn't have to be that situation specifically could be anything amen that that some something even simple something even as we would say relatively Innocent but something that's a perversion something that's against God's word something that we reason oh God will forgive me God will understand amen that's reasoning what are we supposed to do with reasoning cast It cast it down amen praise the Lord so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind womb of her mind she doubted God's word doubted it he questioned it she doubted it then come the actual act the only way that ever that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the Mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that to bring it to life praise the Lord it can happen in a good way the good things that God brings into to us can bring good results in our life can bring good words out of our mouth can bring good thoughts can bring good actions amen when you receive the Holy Ghost as he just said it changed you forever eternally praise God but in a good way this time not in a bad way you didn't grow here but you grew spiritually amen because of Christ coming because of the word because of the spirit of God coming amen note Mary's womb the physical mind was a virgin womb her physical mind was a virgin wom why she believed why she believed God's word no matter how much now this is married no matter how much uh anybody criticized how many things uh somebody said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless oh I wish I could just get that over he says first was in her mind before the ACT could ever take place in the literal womb the ACT had to take place in uh uh in her literal womb the ACT had to first take place in her mind amen the spirit of God let the rest of the work take place now I want to read one more scriptures I'm CL going to close here I want to read one more scripture over and Romans chapter 12 we're going to close here amen sometimes we're presented with other things of life like illness you get sick caner you're going to go go to the doctor and see what the doctor says the doctor says so and so and such and such when the doctor says you're going to die a lot of people defending on how they act will determine what their destination is whether they're going to live or not you got a great attitude or Spirit or feeling in your mind in your spirit in your life doctor says I'm going to die God says I'm Healed now who you going to believe both come in to hear you can reason both of them out but which one are you going to believe which one are you going to receive are you going to receive the word that the doctor says you're a dead man or you going to receive God's words that says you can live amen which one you going to believe amen look Romans chapter 12 let me read this uh Romans 121 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies amen our bodies a living sin see a lot of people say out in the world and they make fun of you and the way Holiness and all and laugh at you and stuff oh God doesn't care what's on the outside he cares what's on the inside read them the scripture yes this scripture says that that we are to present our bodies our bodies yes amen not just the inside but our bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy amen so if anybody says God doesn't care what's on the outside he just cares what's on the inside they don't know the Bible that's right they don't know the scripture amen the scripture says he does care about your body and he wants your body to be a living sacrifice he wants your body body to be holy and acceptable to God right and that is reasonable service that's not even something you consider extraordinary or over the top or going the extra mile this is something that's just reasonable now we consider it that way because it's just the way of life for us we just live that way because that's just who we are it is reasonable to us to the worldly think you're crazy amen the world thinks you're crazy well God don't care about that yes he does yes he does anybody ever tells you that tell them go read uh uh Romans 121 the absolutely does your body is a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye trans transformed by the renewing of your mind amen by the renewing of your mind that is the replenishing that is the uh uh basically new mind New Birth of Mind amen the old mind the old person with the old man is dead yes renew your mind of the spirit of God transformed by the renewing of your mind that's how the trans trans formation of you from being an old dead sinner to a living Christian happens yes that's exactly how it happens amen then you become a living epistle a written epistle read by all men amen because you're a Living Sacrifice yes we people in the world talk all about dead sacrifices and martyrs what about being a Living Sacrifice God didn't tell us to kill ourselves so that we could become Martyrs to serve him no we are to be living sacrifices life holy acceptable to God being transformed by the renewing of our mind that we may prove prove by the renewing of our mind what that good and acceptable and perfect will of God is amen for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think think think where you think in your mind but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of what we live by faith amen amen to live by Fai to every man that measure by his grace by the renewing of your mind renewing of your mind to bring about a new person a new creature now your mind mind you've you you you've updated your your server your computer you've updated it with new antivirus software amen amen your new antivirus software even if the Devil comes with any of his tricks even though he uses the same old stupid dirty tricks comes up with anything different new any other new enticements or uh uh uh uh deceptions you've updated your software amen the things that he used to do to you in the past he can't do anymore he might try but he will not be successful because why you have new software you've been updated you've been renewed by your mind by the renewing of your mind to prove what's acceptable to God Amen you don't have to prove it to God God knows who do you prove it to everybody that knows you everybody whose paths you come across everybody who uh rubs elbows with you or friends with you family with you they recognize it's different how is it different because the reading of your mind now you know by that what is acceptable to God what is not acceptable to God if it's not acceptable to God and he brings it you cast it down yes you bring it captive that antivirus says this doesn't belong here and you hit delete gone amen amen praise the Lord that way it does it does not take a hold in your life your body your spirit amen you do not become impregnated if you will by the deception of the devil you stay and continue to be impregnated with the word of God Amen faithful faithful in truth let's stand if we could faithful and true to the Lord yes above and beyond anything
