[41:39] service in any way that you get the
[41:41] glory honor and praise for all that is
[41:43] son done here in this place God this
[41:46] time that's been set aside that you knew
[41:49] before the foundation of the world that
[41:50] this would be here that we would be here
[41:52] God and you knew Lord as this place
[41:55] would have a would have a significance

[42:12] and draw us closer to you we commit Our
[42:14] Lives to you and all in Jesus Christ's
[42:17] name we pray amen amen praise the Lord
[42:21] Matthew
[42:23] 11:25 at that time Jesus answered said I
[42:26] thank thee F oh
[42:28] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[42:30] thou has hid these things for the wise
[42:32] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[42:35] bads amen you can be seated if you'd
[42:39] like
[42:41] amen from there I'd like to go over to
[42:44] Isaiah Isaiah chapter 59 read one verse
[42:48] of scripture
[42:50] here Isaiah 59 very uh enlightening ver
[42:55] uh scripture chapter actually but I just
[42:58] want to read one verse out of it if you
[43:00] uh get the time your home comes on your
[43:02] mind maybe get out Bibles in your
[43:05] reading time and go back to Isaiah
[43:08] 59 parallels a lot actually over into
[43:11] Ephesians as well uh but Isaiah chapter
[43:14] 59 just one verse of scripture Isaiah
[43:18] 59:19 this is kind of where we want to
[43:20] draw a context for this service today
[43:23] amen it won't be too long uh just TR the
[43:26] leading of the Lord here though Isaiah
[43:29] 59:19 amen it says so shall th so shall
[43:32] they fear the name of the Lord from the
[43:35] East uh from the West and his glory from
[43:38] the rising of the sun when the enemy
[43:41] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[43:44] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[43:46] against him amen amen and we've quoted
[43:48] that many many times but based on the uh
[43:51] the the direction of this service today
[43:54] I felt led to read this to us sometimes
[43:56] s it's a lot means a lot more when you
[43:58] read it from the scripture than just
[43:59] simply quoting it but I want to read
[44:02] this last part again listen very closely
[44:04] it says when the enemy when the enemy
[44:06] shall come in like a flood now that's
[44:08] not your brother that's not your sister
[44:10] that's not the church down the street
[44:12] that's the devil amen that's the devil
[44:14] the devil when he comes in like a
[44:17] flood the spirit of the Lord the Holy
[44:20] Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[44:23] standard against him amen a standard
[44:27] against him praise the Lord now I want
[44:28] to go over to Revelation praise the Lord
[44:32] and uh go from our go for our context
[44:35] continuing today so remember when the
[44:37] enemy comes in like a flood amen the
[44:40] spirit of the Lord raises a standard
[44:44] against him
[44:47] amen Revelation chapter
[44:50] 4 praise the Lord Revelation 4 I want to
[44:54] read a couple of verses of scripture
[44:57] here um I wish I had more time probably
[45:02] could take the time but um to read a lot
[45:05] more of the the scripture pertaining to
[45:07] this but I'll just want to get to the
[45:09] highlights of this part that we want to
[45:11] speak on today uh Revelation 4 uh verse
[45:15] 6 and Before the
[45:17] Throne there was a sea of glass like
[45:21] unto christone and we know the waters uh
[45:23] represent people scripture most
[45:25] multitudes throngs of people uh would be
[45:28] considered a sea uh scripturally sea of
[45:33] glass like unto Crystal uh and in the
[45:36] midst of the throne and round about The
[45:39] Throne were four beasts full uh full of
[45:43] eyes before and
[45:46] behind uh and the eyes are just symbolic
[45:49] I've seen these pictures that theyve
[45:50] drawn tried to artists tried to draw
[45:53] these pictures of these beasts and have
[45:55] eyes all over them it's more of a
[45:57] symbolic uh issue here not the fact that
[46:00] there's actually eyeballs on every one
[46:03] of them all over top bottom front back
[46:07] is is symbolic of the vision uh the
[46:10] seeing uh is is to say that uh Le let's
[46:15] just say this real quick uh God knows
[46:17] all things does he not there's not one
[46:20] thing that happens that God doesn't know
[46:22] about but that doesn't mean God has
[46:24] eyeballs all over his head in front and
[46:26] back and all around just understand it's
[46:28] the vision of the lord it's it's it's
[46:31] the vision of of the uh foresight of a
[46:35] prophecy even of what's about to take
[46:37] place because remember Jon is on the AL
[46:39] of patmas caught up in the in the spirit
[46:41] of the Lord on the Lord's day that
[46:44] wasn't Sunday or Saturday it was two
[46:46] years uh caught up in the Lord as God
[46:49] was revealing these things through him
[46:51] showing to him in many ways symbolic
[46:54] gestures symbolic things that he would
[46:56] see uh that's why you notice and we'll
[46:59] just let me let me get to this part
[47:00] because uh you'll notice all through
[47:03] Revelation where uh John says unto or as
[47:08] or like unto he doesn't say it's exactly
[47:12] this in a lot of cases let's read this
[47:14] rest of this now uh seventh
[47:17] verse and the first Beast was like a
[47:21] lion he didn't say it was a lion but he
[47:24] said it was like a lion
[47:26] so in every way I believe what he saw
[47:29] was something that had the same defining
[47:31] characteristics of a lion of what a lion
[47:34] would be or project amen so you notice
[47:38] that and that runs in continuity through
[47:40] the scripture with John A lot of it is
[47:42] unto or as or like uh this is one of
[47:46] those places the first Beast was like a
[47:50] lion the second beast like a calf and
[47:54] the third Beast had a face as a man a
[47:58] lot of people say he was a man that's
[48:00] not what the scripture says amen he had
[48:03] the face of a man now brother random
[48:06] talks about this man as the intelligence
[48:09] amen uh the intelligence of the age of
[48:12] man but it was simply the face of man
[48:15] didn't say he had the Torso legs body
[48:18] just the face of the man see and the
[48:20] fourth Beast was like a flying eagle
[48:24] amen now these those four anointings
[48:27] each age that that I just want to touch
[48:31] on here today uh to take us forward each
[48:34] age had its own special anointing now
[48:38] notice we go back to the scripture that
[48:40] we just read in Isaiah when he talks
[48:43] about the enemy coming in like a flood
[48:45] that God the Holy Spirit raising that
[48:49] standard against the against the the the
[48:53] the enemy against the devil God raising
[48:56] a standard against it so each time the
[48:58] enemy would come in the God would raise
[49:02] a standard against it each one of these
[49:04] animals each one of these uh visionist
[49:07] beasts was like unto a specific Beast a
[49:12] specific animal for a specific purpose
[49:15] it was a
[49:16] representation of an anointing of God
[49:20] Amen a representation of an anointing of
[49:22] god notice that they were by around
[49:25] about in The Throne of God as an
[49:28] anointing each one of these represented
[49:31] a type of an anointing now look I want
[49:33] you to see because I I felt it would be
[49:36] a little bit more um it maybe make a
[49:39] little bit more sense if if I wrote it
[49:42] out and I'm sorry if my handwriting is
[49:44] terrible uh I thought about trying to
[49:46] put it on the computer and put it up on
[49:47] the screens but uh I couldn't get that
[49:50] to work either so uh I just wrote it out
[49:52] here hopefully you can see it okay but
[49:54] we want to talk talk about now let's go
[49:56] over to Revelations chapter 6 and I want
[49:58] to go over this uh again to to
[50:02] understand uh the the workings of God in
[50:05] the churches now this
[50:09] obviously outside of the revealing of
[50:11] the Seven Seals was that that that part
[50:14] of those seals that that brother that
[50:16] God gave to brother Bram to bring to the
[50:19] church to bring to the bride amen uh and
[50:22] and that is the the the subtitle of this
[50:27] uh sermon today Bride versus church or
[50:31] bride and church however you want to say
[50:32] it uh but brother brandham did not uh
[50:37] and actually most of the world probably
[50:40] still sees no difference uh they look at
[50:42] the scripture uh they teach in their
[50:44] seminaries they preach in their churches
[50:47] uh that there's the bride and church is
[50:49] the same the same people and they're not
[50:54] uh you look to the scripture you can
[50:55] find out that now obviously that's
[50:58] things that you read through the
[50:59] scripture that God brings as a
[51:01] revelation to you that you can see and
[51:04] brother brandom uh in his early Ministry
[51:07] made the in his preaching basically
[51:10] coupled the two together it wasn't until
[51:12] the time of the seals uh I believe
[51:15] actually before the first seal was broke
[51:17] and brother bam talked about uh in the
[51:19] breach where brother brandham actually
[51:22] definitively begin to separate the bride
[51:24] from the church church and begin to
[51:26] teach that the bride and the church are
[51:29] two separate groups amen now we find it
[51:32] all through the scriptures it's not hard
[51:33] to understand it's just getting out of
[51:36] the out of the denominational teaching
[51:38] and into truth that helps you understand
[51:41] when God reveals the word to you that
[51:44] that this Falls perfectly in continuity
[51:47] with the rest of the scripture and it's
[51:49] it's absolutely perfect to understand
[51:51] one of the greatest dilemmas that a lot
[51:53] of people have and a lot of people in uh
[51:55] Christian churches today still believe
[51:57] that God's people we'll just put it that
[52:00] way are going to go through the
[52:02] tribulation and that is not true but
[52:06] there when if you have the church and
[52:09] the bride being the same group I could
[52:11] understand that but when you see through
[52:13] Revelation by the scripture that the
[52:15] church is one group and the bride's a
[52:17] different group The Bride is they called
[52:19] out of the church group that that the
[52:23] church does go to the tribulation
[52:25] but the bride does not amen amen so when
[52:29] you separate them by by through the
[52:32] scripture and you read it the in the
[52:34] context by the word you see that the
[52:36] church would go to the to the
[52:39] tribulation the bride does not that's
[52:40] why a lot of people because they see it
[52:43] going through that way which makes sense
[52:47] but it it doesn't if you separate the
[52:49] two and a lot of a lot of Christian does
[52:52] not they don't see a difference they
[52:53] don't know there's a difference but
[52:55] there is a difference there's a very
[52:57] distinct difference between the bride
[52:59] and the church so much so that Matthew
[53:02] 25 that Jesus tells a whole parable
[53:05] about the two groups amen but let's
[53:09] let's move on with this so we'll begin
[53:11] about uh uh with with the bride versus
[53:14] the church recognizing the very most
[53:18] Stark difference between the bride and
[53:20] the church is the church goes to the
[53:21] tribulation the bride does
[53:24] not
[53:26] uh which brings into understanding that
[53:30] the that the bride has a new birth and
[53:34] the church does not right amen amen the
[53:38] biggest difference between the two the
[53:40] only difference in Matthew 25 the only
[53:42] difference in Matthew 25 is one had the
[53:45] Holy Ghost and one didn't right they all
[53:47] had an
[53:49] anointing but one had an indwelling
[53:51] presence and the other did not that's
[53:53] the difference amen the difference in
[53:56] the bride and the church the church is
[53:58] still a virtuous group amen but they're
[54:01] not they're they're not born again the
[54:04] Bride is a born again called out group
[54:07] amen so we see the difference now to be
[54:10] able to understand where we're going to
[54:12] go with this and and
[54:14] recognize uh the fulfilling and
[54:18] hopefully encourage us today of Isaiah
[54:22] 59 that when the enemy does come in when
[54:26] the enemy does try to strike you there's
[54:29] a standard that God has already set now
[54:32] look this isn't something that we
[54:34] recognize that is some great new thing
[54:37] that God does for us every day no no
[54:40] God's already done it the standard is
[54:43] already set the standard is already
[54:45] there and we my friend the bride is the
[54:48] standard Bearer for this day amen for
[54:52] the last day especially we are the
[54:54] standard Bearer so when he comes in the
[54:57] enemy comes in like a flood that
[54:59] standard is already there brother Ram
[55:02] said if God could come and heal you
[55:04] right now he would do it but God can do
[55:08] no more for you right now than what he
[55:10] has already done if God could come in
[55:13] this place right now and save you all he
[55:16] would do it but he can't do anymore than
[55:19] what he's already done right which
[55:21] brings salvation and healing and all the
[55:24] other red blessings that we have need of
[55:27] in our human flesh God's already given
[55:29] them the standards already there the the
[55:32] the the the price has already been paid
[55:34] it's already been met so the standards
[55:37] already there we just grab a hold of
[55:39] that standard and we ride that wave over
[55:42] the enemy amen amen we ride it over the
[55:45] enemy faith faith faith comes by hearing
[55:48] hearing the word of God that's the
[55:50] standard amen that's the standard that
[55:52] God gives so the enemy continues to come
[55:54] in like a Flood now notice the enemy
[55:56] does not have a standard the enemy just
[55:59] goes about doing what he can do to
[56:01] disrupt everything that God's done or is
[56:03] God is doing he has no standard but God
[56:05] has a
[56:06] standard you can't stand on the words of
[56:09] the
[56:10] devil you can't stand on the words of a
[56:13] person they're here today and gone
[56:15] tomorrow science medicine whatever it is
[56:18] education it all changes continually but
[56:21] you can trust and believe on the
[56:23] standard that God has
[56:26] that God has placed that standard is
[56:28] still there today and we are the ones
[56:30] that are to be the standard Bearer so
[56:33] that when the enemy comes in like a
[56:35] flood we stand up and we say boo amen
[56:39] boo devil yes that devil has no place
[56:43] friend amen amen the devil will begin to
[56:46] shrink back down he has no place because
[56:49] the standard has already been set when
[56:51] the when the enemy when that standard
[56:53] comes across that what ever the devil
[56:55] tries to bring it crested every one of
[56:58] those waves just like it was here look
[57:01] now the sman let let's start with the
[57:03] church ages
[57:05] here we have the Ephesian Church age the
[57:07] sman church age pergamus thus Sardis
[57:10] Philadelphia Leia that's the seven
[57:12] Church ages uh those a lot of people
[57:14] don't even believe in uh uh Dimensions
[57:18] like that of of uh of the churches
[57:20] through time they just believe that in
[57:22] the scripture that it was just speaking
[57:24] solely to those churches that were there
[57:27] at that time in Ephesus and in Smur and
[57:29] in pergamus that's what they only
[57:31] believe that they don't believe they're
[57:33] not dimensionist or uh uh not that's not
[57:36] what I'm trying to say they're not uh
[57:38] dispens dispensationalist thank you
[57:40] sister dispensationalists they don't
[57:43] believe in the dispensations that we
[57:45] believe in amen that we know to be true
[57:48] Not only was it about each of those
[57:50] churches that was there at the time but
[57:52] that there's each Church age that birth
[57:55] forth out of the beginning at at uh uh
[57:59] at uh the upper room Amen on the day of
[58:02] Pentecost that each one's birth forth
[58:04] now the the greatest example that we
[58:07] have here that we can
[58:11] see Revelation
[58:13] 6 doesn't speak on the church ages but
[58:16] it talks about uh as we know the
[58:20] seals and the seals that Encompass the
[58:24] Church ages amen now we know that
[58:28] there's Seven Seals and seven Church
[58:30] ages but only four seals pertain to the
[58:32] church ages the fifth seal is the souls
[58:35] under the altar Sixth Seal is
[58:37] tribulation seventh seal is coming of
[58:38] the Lord amen so there's only four that
[58:41] pertain to them so as you look at them
[58:44] and recognize them in their dates I
[58:46] didn't put the dates down I I ran out of
[58:48] room almost basic as it was uh I didn't
[58:51] put the dates down but if you had a
[58:53] church age book or something you can
[58:55] look you can see how the dates fall in
[58:57] line and how perfectly it is that that
[59:00] the scripture talks about especially in
[59:02] the seals that lines these Church ages
[59:05] out it's uh it's actually it's actually
[59:08] really pretty here but I want us to see
[59:11] uh kind of more or less the this this
[59:14] message of encouragement of the enemy
[59:16] coming in like a flood that God's done
[59:18] it all through amen all through the
[59:21] church ages even in the Dark Ages God
[59:23] was still there
[59:25] the holy spirit is brother said Bound By
[59:27] the Doors of Creeds and dogmas couldn't
[59:29] move like it was but there was still
[59:31] that Sil sliver of light in the darkest
[59:34] of Ages in the in the pergamus and thar
[59:37] there was still that sliver of light
[59:40] amen that represented the bride for that
[59:42] day amen praise the Lord now we know
[59:45] each circle was a church age but that
[59:48] sliver was God's people that was the
[59:50] bride but the the first church age was
[59:53] Ephesus now I thought thought I could
[59:55] just read through uh Revelation 2 and 3
[1:00:00] uh but we can if you want to do that we
[1:00:02] can do that at home or do that later or
[1:00:04] something uh to read through these
[1:00:06] Church ages again but the Ephesians was
[1:00:09] the first church age it was the birth of
[1:00:12] the church uh Ephesians birth the church
[1:00:16] forth now as the Ephesian Church age was
[1:00:19] birth forth at the day of Pentecost with
[1:00:21] the new birth that was taking place
[1:00:23] there on the upper room 3,000 Souls
[1:00:26] added that day amen as that Ephesus
[1:00:29] Church burth forth there was that lion
[1:00:31] nature wasn't a lion but lion nature
[1:00:35] that was there as an anointing that
[1:00:38] Beast that was there to represent that
[1:00:40] church age it was there as an anointing
[1:00:43] now remember uh there there's there's
[1:00:46] there's that Holy Spirit anointing over
[1:00:48] the whole world the rain falls on the
[1:00:51] just and the unjust but there's a
[1:00:53] specific special anointing hope you can
[1:00:56] see maybe sister Julie probably not in a
[1:00:58] good place for you um that specific
[1:01:01] special anointing for the bride amen
[1:01:05] that's what that lion anointing was and
[1:01:08] of course we know the lion would
[1:01:10] represent Christ amen with the new birth
[1:01:13] of course the Holy Spirit coming down in
[1:01:15] the upper room birthing the church forth
[1:01:17] of course that was Jesus Christ that was
[1:01:20] the spirit of God that was God's spirit
[1:01:22] in the church bir in the church forth
[1:01:25] that's why that lion anointing was there
[1:01:29] it was going forth it was doing its Duty
[1:01:32] as as that church was being born now the
[1:01:35] second Church age the smia church age
[1:01:38] was a church age that was anointed for
[1:01:41] death uh so much so as you notice in the
[1:01:45] circles that brother random Drew out uh
[1:01:49] there was less light in that church age
[1:01:51] in the sman church
[1:01:52] age as that SM Church age went forth uh
[1:01:57] it it got darker and darker because it
[1:02:00] started getting more towards uh uh the
[1:02:03] church started getting more toward
[1:02:06] dogmas and more towards uh organization
[1:02:10] and denomination amen it didn't start
[1:02:13] yet didn't start till pergamus in 3 uh
[1:02:16] 320 ad uh were the the N year Rome when
[1:02:20] they all came together but this was the
[1:02:23] predecessor of it
[1:02:25] amen the beginning of it in Ephesus they
[1:02:28] left their first love when they left
[1:02:30] their first love they fell just enough
[1:02:34] for Deeds to be mentioned to be brought
[1:02:38] forth things that were not scriptural
[1:02:41] and in smia those those uh those things
[1:02:46] that were mentioned those deeds became
[1:02:48] Doctrine amen and and as they became
[1:02:51] doctrine that anointed this church age
[1:02:53] for death
[1:02:55] of course myrr is one of the uh things
[1:03:00] that they brought to Jesus uh at his
[1:03:02] birth which was a symbolization of uh of
[1:03:06] the anointing of his death amen we know
[1:03:09] that when when the three wise men had
[1:03:11] brought those gold myrr uh and
[1:03:14] frankincense myrr was the thing that
[1:03:17] they used to embomb the
[1:03:19] dead Myrrh is the root word of smia
[1:03:23] anointed for death because at that time
[1:03:27] it began to continue to slide it was
[1:03:29] still under the anointing of the lion
[1:03:31] that still there was still bride in that
[1:03:34] age amen because there's bride in every
[1:03:36] age there was still bride in that age
[1:03:39] that were still anointed by the lion by
[1:03:42] the lion Nature by the lion Beast so
[1:03:45] even as these Church ages begin to slide
[1:03:49] into uh dogmas and doctrines of devils
[1:03:53] they begin to slide into what then in
[1:03:56] pergamos became the
[1:03:58] Catholicism when they met in
[1:04:00] niome uh just like they did just like
[1:04:04] Israel did uh when they got together and
[1:04:07] they said uh we like God and all but we
[1:04:11] want a king over us uh God's a good guy
[1:04:15] we like him we want him around but we
[1:04:17] want a king over us we want to be like
[1:04:19] all the other nations and we want to
[1:04:21] have a king we want to have somebody
[1:04:22] rule over us see
[1:04:25] brother R says they finally rejected God
[1:04:28] when they did that amen right but God
[1:04:32] honored their request nevertheless and
[1:04:34] gave them AA of the House of Benjamin
[1:04:37] amen and then we know Samuel and so
[1:04:39] forth but they did the same thing
[1:04:43] here they they they were going along and
[1:04:47] the and as each one of the the apostles
[1:04:50] begin to die off a little bit more of
[1:04:53] the corruption began to come in there
[1:04:55] was still always that
[1:04:57] anointing for the bride for the ones
[1:05:01] that stayed true in that day but at the
[1:05:04] end of the saman church age when that
[1:05:07] when it was dying off because it was
[1:05:09] anointed to death and remember each one
[1:05:12] of these ages kind of overlaps each
[1:05:14] other I know uh if I remember right the
[1:05:17] dates on the church age book They're
[1:05:19] they're very specific but brother
[1:05:21] brandom tells us that each one of those
[1:05:23] age overlapped each other right so as
[1:05:27] each so as one Church age was going out
[1:05:30] while it was going out the other one was
[1:05:32] coming in right so there was an overlap
[1:05:35] so during that time is when between smia
[1:05:39] anointed for death still under the lion
[1:05:42] but anointed for death slid over into
[1:05:45] the pergamus church age which was the
[1:05:47] birth of Catholicism or the seed of
[1:05:52] Satan it became the seed of Satan
[1:05:54] remember we read I I know it's been a
[1:05:57] long time but when we go back to
[1:05:59] Thessalonians chapter 2 and we see in
[1:06:01] there where uh he as uh uh as God
[1:06:06] sitting in the temple of God showing
[1:06:09] himself that he is God he became in that
[1:06:12] seed of Satan became through this Dogma
[1:06:16] through this Doctrine through this
[1:06:18] denomination he became an object of
[1:06:21] worship and we see here look and I saw
[1:06:26] now this the first two Church
[1:06:29] ages Revelation 61 first
[1:06:32] seal and I saw when the lamb opened one
[1:06:35] of the seals now the lamb is Christ the
[1:06:38] lamb is not brother brand the lamb is
[1:06:41] Christ Christ opened the seals not wing
[1:06:43] and brown amen the lamb opened one of
[1:06:47] the seals and I heard it were as the
[1:06:50] noise of thunder so it was a thunder in
[1:06:52] the first seal as these as these seals
[1:06:55] began to unfold a thunder came forth we
[1:06:57] know a thunder represents a voice in
[1:07:00] this case would be the voice of God the
[1:07:02] voice of God speaking but he's speaking
[1:07:06] through he's speaking through these
[1:07:10] anointed representatives of the Bride
[1:07:13] for that age which is what we call it
[1:07:16] calls the Beast of that age or the lion
[1:07:18] in this case now that Thunder one of the
[1:07:22] four beasts
[1:07:24] uh saying come and see we know that was
[1:07:27] the lion beast at First Church age now
[1:07:30] what comes in we've already I don't need
[1:07:32] to go into this in great detail because
[1:07:34] we've already did we've already gone
[1:07:36] through the six seal the sixth chapter
[1:07:38] many times uh and talked about it in
[1:07:41] detail so I I'm not going to go into
[1:07:44] that detail again I just want to hit
[1:07:46] those highlights to get the point here
[1:07:49] one of the four beasts saying come and
[1:07:50] see that's the lion Beast that anointing
[1:07:53] for that that time come and see and I
[1:07:56] saw and behold a white horse and he that
[1:07:59] sat on him had a bow no Arrow just a bow
[1:08:03] a bluff and a crown was given unto him
[1:08:07] didn't earn it didn't inherit it it was
[1:08:09] given to him and he went forth
[1:08:12] conquering and to conquer in these two
[1:08:15] Church ages and he was beginning to
[1:08:18] succeed he did succeed he took over by
[1:08:22] calling the the SE of Satan this
[1:08:25] pergamus church age the beginning of
[1:08:28] Catholicism was the beginning of what
[1:08:31] the ultimate severe downfall of of this
[1:08:35] church
[1:08:36] began it slid all the way to the point
[1:08:40] that it ended up in the dark ages to
[1:08:42] word just barely just a small sliver of
[1:08:45] light of people of of of Believers but
[1:08:49] there was always an
[1:08:51] anointing it was always an anointing
[1:08:54] seej
[1:08:55] look as that enemy came in like a flood
[1:08:59] started the Catholic Church uh baptism
[1:09:02] in Father Son and Holy Ghost titles
[1:09:04] titles for everything basically again
[1:09:06] I've said this
[1:09:07] before Satan's whole goal and aim was to
[1:09:12] wipe the name of Jesus Christ away right
[1:09:16] he did not want anybody calling on the
[1:09:19] name of Jesus Christ titles is fine even
[1:09:22] you say father son holy ghost Crossing
[1:09:25] yourself of course that's a heathenistic
[1:09:27] trait Crossing yourself is Heathen trait
[1:09:29] I can show you the scripture it's a it's
[1:09:31] a heathen trait just like cutting
[1:09:33] yourself that a lot of people do amen
[1:09:35] it's a heathen trade Crossing yourself
[1:09:38] what where did it come from the seed of
[1:09:40] Satan the pergamus church age but notice
[1:09:43] friend as it did that as the Catholic
[1:09:47] Church gained strength as people looked
[1:09:50] at it and they thought Oh What a Mighty
[1:09:52] power what what a great thing how
[1:09:55] beautiful the churches how great and
[1:09:57] began to give them all the wealth of the
[1:10:00] world into the into the Catholic Church
[1:10:03] brother Ram said he went to the Vatican
[1:10:04] one time you know and and and is as you
[1:10:08] know he's uh they said you know do this
[1:10:11] and do this cut the cuff out of your
[1:10:13] pants and all this mess and he said I
[1:10:15] was glad to do that he says now when I
[1:10:17] come up to him what do I do he says you
[1:10:18] got to bow on the one KN knee and kiss
[1:10:20] his ring said oh no that's out I'm not
[1:10:23] doing that but he said I went in that
[1:10:25] place he said you couldn't buy it with a
[1:10:27] billion billion billion dollars or
[1:10:28] something like that a billion trillion
[1:10:31] dollars something to that effect he said
[1:10:33] all that wealth coming into this place
[1:10:35] it looks so grandioso and that's what
[1:10:38] attracts people that's Whata attacks uh
[1:10:41] uh attracts people's emotions and
[1:10:44] feelings and think well how could
[1:10:46] something Follow by so many people and
[1:10:48] such a beautiful thing how could it be
[1:10:51] wrong because it's of the devil but
[1:10:54] that's the trick of the enemy just from
[1:10:56] the very beginning of the Garden of Eden
[1:10:58] his whole trick he works through Beauty
[1:11:00] always has still does Amen to attract to
[1:11:04] deceive to to to bring people to draw
[1:11:08] people away from Christ the word and he
[1:11:10] did an excellent job the pergamus church
[1:11:12] age and the people the church let him
[1:11:17] right they let
[1:11:19] him but there was a bride there's always
[1:11:22] a bride under that that calf anointing
[1:11:24] and he they they killed they
[1:11:27] murdered 60 I think on on the on the
[1:11:30] catholic's
[1:11:32] books not not a third independent
[1:11:35] Arbiter but the C the Catholic Church
[1:11:39] themselves recorded 63 million
[1:11:44] murders of Protestants at that time
[1:11:47] through this Dark Age and we entered
[1:11:49] into thar which was the Dark Ages but
[1:11:52] look at the anointing
[1:11:54] God sends remember God sent forth this
[1:11:56] line anointing in the first couple of
[1:11:59] church ages that was Christ the birth of
[1:12:01] the church the Raging forth the the the
[1:12:04] the telling of Christ the story of
[1:12:05] Christ the uh Salvation all around the
[1:12:08] world remember three or as it was in
[1:12:11] that day 3,000 people were added to the
[1:12:14] church the very day of the day of
[1:12:16] Pentecost it's 120 Upper Room yeah it
[1:12:19] was 120 yes but Paul's uh but uh um
[1:12:24] Peter's sermon was so persuasive that
[1:12:26] the Bible says 3,000 were added that
[1:12:29] very day amen and that was that lion
[1:12:32] anointing going forth now there's a
[1:12:35] different anointing on these on pergamus
[1:12:38] and thar there's a different anointing
[1:12:40] but notice that anointing that standard
[1:12:43] even though these people had to give
[1:12:45] their lives even though they had to diey
[1:12:47] in marman they still had that anointing
[1:12:51] Amen in my opinion
[1:12:54] and I believe it has been recorded I'd
[1:12:55] have to go back and look again so I'm
[1:12:57] speaking kind of off the cuff a little
[1:12:58] bit some of you may know if you've read
[1:13:00] especially if you've read the fox book
[1:13:02] of Martyrs that at that time when people
[1:13:07] were going to the stake to be burned at
[1:13:10] the state they stood there with with
[1:13:14] with
[1:13:15] joy and thankfulness that for the
[1:13:19] testimony of Jesus Christ they could
[1:13:21] give their lives amen
[1:13:24] singing praising worshiping God I don't
[1:13:27] think they felt a
[1:13:29] thing I don't think they felt I don't
[1:13:31] think they felt one single lick of that
[1:13:33] fire because it was an anointing there
[1:13:36] now the Bible says calf anointing
[1:13:39] brother random references ox or laboring
[1:13:42] a laboring or or a animal that
[1:13:45] sacrifices themselves gives themselves U
[1:13:50] even to death that's why that Ox
[1:13:52] anointing was the next anointing and
[1:13:54] when he had opened the second seal I
[1:13:57] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:14:00] went out another horse that was red
[1:14:02] bloody power was given to him that sat
[1:14:05] there on to do what take peace from the
[1:14:09] earth and that they should kill one
[1:14:11] another which they did and there was
[1:14:14] given unto him a great
[1:14:17] sword and was given unto him a great
[1:14:21] sword why because this is the dark
[1:14:23] ages the seed had to fall into the
[1:14:26] ground before it could come back up and
[1:14:29] but God already the standard was already
[1:14:33] there Saints yep praise the Lord the ox
[1:14:37] anointing was already there for those
[1:14:39] people that calf anointing was already
[1:14:42] there for those people see that's why
[1:14:46] brother VanDam could kind of change it
[1:14:48] to the ox
[1:14:50] because John the Revelator saw it and
[1:14:52] said this was like
[1:14:54] unto so the like unto is the same thing
[1:14:58] it's a sacrifice it's it's something
[1:15:01] that gave itself willingly it was a it
[1:15:03] was a beast of burden uh the ox is a
[1:15:06] burden Bearer that's why that anointing
[1:15:08] was here for those people that day yes
[1:15:11] they gave their lives yes it's horrible
[1:15:13] the morate and all that they went
[1:15:14] through but there was an anointing there
[1:15:17] to help them to be with them while they
[1:15:19] went through it again I don't believe as
[1:15:22] they as all these things were
[1:15:25] happening the story I believe in Fox
[1:15:27] book of Martyrs this couple their
[1:15:30] children had been mared
[1:15:32] martyred uh uh they had come up to the
[1:15:35] place that they would not deny Jesus
[1:15:37] Christ and they came up to uh twin
[1:15:40] stakes in the ground that they were both
[1:15:42] going to be burned and God saw the fire
[1:15:44] raging or something or the the the the
[1:15:47] kenneling built up there and and it got
[1:15:51] a hold of his heart he said I I Rec
[1:15:53] can't I Rec can't I Rec can't he quit
[1:15:55] and his wife looked at him and said what
[1:15:56] are you doing honey please don't no she
[1:15:59] pleaded and begged for him not to recant
[1:16:01] but he recanted
[1:16:03] anyway so even that separation she
[1:16:06] walked and she walked gladly up to that
[1:16:08] Stak and was burned at the steak and her
[1:16:11] husband so it's it it it shows friend
[1:16:14] that a person can look like it act like
[1:16:18] it sound like it all the way through but
[1:16:20] when it come right up to where excuse me
[1:16:22] where the rubber me the road he couldn't
[1:16:24] do it right right up to the very point
[1:16:28] of going to that state she looked at him
[1:16:30] and said honey it'll be over in a couple
[1:16:32] of minutes it's
[1:16:35] okay but I don't believe that that
[1:16:37] anointing was falling on those people I
[1:16:39] don't believe she felt the thing amen
[1:16:42] they pushed off the cliffs on the spikes
[1:16:45] and gashed open and honey and bees come
[1:16:48] and eat them up and it it just the
[1:16:51] things that happened during those Dark
[1:16:53] Ages 63 million of them just because
[1:16:56] they were Protestant Saints but that
[1:16:59] anointing was there the enemy was coming
[1:17:01] in like a flood even to the point that
[1:17:03] the the Dark Ages were almost completely
[1:17:06] blacked out but that anointing was still
[1:17:08] there for those people there was a bride
[1:17:10] at that age because God that standard
[1:17:14] was there that standard bear at that
[1:17:16] time it was for those people to give
[1:17:20] their lives IM morate that's what the
[1:17:22] anointing was for that day it was for
[1:17:25] them to give their lives that's why they
[1:17:28] did they freely went to that stake
[1:17:30] because of what was uh what that
[1:17:33] anointing was on them you freely do what
[1:17:36] you do as you serve the Lord Jesus
[1:17:39] because there's an anointing on you to
[1:17:41] do it there's a reason that God put that
[1:17:44] on you so that you have that feel that
[1:17:47] and and live that because it's who you
[1:17:51] are it's God on you you and when that
[1:17:54] Devil comes in anytime we have a
[1:17:56] standard against it amen they had a
[1:18:00] standard against it even in the Dark
[1:18:02] Ages they had a standard against it and
[1:18:04] you go down to the Sardis Church
[1:18:07] age you have a you have an anointing of
[1:18:10] that's that's the face of a man brother
[1:18:12] Ram called
[1:18:13] intelligence during this period of time
[1:18:17] we had the birth of the Renaissance
[1:18:21] intelligence sculpture paintings
[1:18:24] literature poetry all these
[1:18:27] things was a part of the Renaissance
[1:18:30] birth of the intelligence of man that
[1:18:32] led to into I could bring you the dates
[1:18:36] but anyway that led into the
[1:18:40] Reformation what we know now is the
[1:18:43] reforming of the church praise the Lord
[1:18:46] through the intelligence of man what did
[1:18:48] that mean through God uh through man
[1:18:51] well God the an anointing man uh being
[1:18:55] Anointed with this even maybe
[1:18:57] unbeknownst to them they started
[1:18:59] inventing things during the Renaissance
[1:19:03] things be they began to invent things
[1:19:05] left and things over and over and the
[1:19:07] greatest thing that was invented during
[1:19:10] the Renaissance that was capitalized
[1:19:13] during the Reformation was the printing
[1:19:16] press and man who began to want to take
[1:19:19] just oh my help me
[1:19:21] Lord to take take one page of this
[1:19:24] sacred Bible and read it over and over
[1:19:28] and over and over and over because
[1:19:30] that's all they
[1:19:32] have we got a whole Hall oh God help us
[1:19:37] amen yes they poured over one page over
[1:19:41] and over and
[1:19:43] over and then they started printing it
[1:19:47] but they could only print like a Bible
[1:19:49] in defiance of the Catholic church in
[1:19:52] remember these are lapping over now in
[1:19:55] defiance of the Catholic church and in
[1:19:58] and in threat of the Catholic Church's
[1:20:02] dominance there was an anointing on
[1:20:05] those
[1:20:05] people uh the White Cliffs and I forget
[1:20:09] all their names hus and different ones
[1:20:12] they those men under that anointing
[1:20:15] begin to uh take the word when they get
[1:20:18] it and started to try to replicate it in
[1:20:21] their language so people could have it
[1:20:23] so people could read it anyone that was
[1:20:25] caught with it though now was murdered
[1:20:27] was killed was hung or burned at the
[1:20:30] steak something but even if they were
[1:20:33] found to know parts of this they would
[1:20:35] come up to little kids and they would
[1:20:37] say do you know uh uh the Ten
[1:20:40] Commandments or something like this if
[1:20:42] that child knew it they took them
[1:20:44] away they took that child away from the
[1:20:46] parents right then and killed them
[1:20:47] killed a whole
[1:20:49] family that's how that's how suppressive
[1:20:53] that
[1:20:56] was it does make you wonder why there's
[1:20:58] a Statue of Liberty out in Isis Island
[1:21:00] in New York now and how happy those
[1:21:03] people were to come to a place to come
[1:21:05] to a land where they weren't under that
[1:21:07] oppression where they weren't under that
[1:21:10] denomination where they weren't forced
[1:21:12] to do something that in their good
[1:21:14] conscience they did not want to
[1:21:17] do but this man anointing began to get
[1:21:20] on these men amen and started and of
[1:21:24] course each one we know has has its
[1:21:26] reformer of its day its Prophet if you
[1:21:29] will they weren't prophets but you know
[1:21:31] each one is God gave to brother brandom
[1:21:34] as he come down to this
[1:21:36] reformation and this Reformation was of
[1:21:39] course that was Wesley or I mean uh
[1:21:42] Luther the just shall live by faith
[1:21:45] these men begin to print the Bibles and
[1:21:47] the Gutenberg printing press because of
[1:21:48] the Renaissance the Gutenberg printing
[1:21:50] press was invented and they could M they
[1:21:53] could Mass produce the Bible so that
[1:21:57] hundreds and thousands of people could
[1:21:59] have it instead of just one or two
[1:22:00] people they can have the whole thing
[1:22:03] instead of just one page amen that
[1:22:07] anointing is what brought that to pass
[1:22:10] that anointing of that man intelligence
[1:22:13] that brought this to fruition so that
[1:22:15] these people could have the Bible
[1:22:19] amen now you go down to the Philadelphia
[1:22:22] Church which is above the the age of
[1:22:25] Love they say it's the missionary age
[1:22:27] it's the age brother bam called of the
[1:22:29] open door uh when the Bible speaks of
[1:22:32] that Open Door he's talking about the
[1:22:33] Philadelphia Church age when when after
[1:22:36] this the Bible was printed and and and
[1:22:39] of course then around that time when uh
[1:22:42] a miracle was discovered and and the the
[1:22:45] the gospel began to spread like never
[1:22:48] before and men like Wesley uh who was
[1:22:51] the Charles Wesley his his brother I I
[1:22:55] forg I had some of the statistics
[1:22:56] written down before of how many miles
[1:22:58] that man traveled on a horse how many
[1:23:00] times in a week he preached the gospel
[1:23:03] to try to get that word out that open
[1:23:06] door that mission age look at this
[1:23:08] now and when he had opened the third
[1:23:10] seal I heard the third Beast say come
[1:23:13] and see and I beheld in low a black
[1:23:15] horse and he that sat on him had a pair
[1:23:17] of balances in his hand continuing now
[1:23:19] to weigh out the wealth of the world
[1:23:21] pences for this and that that and I
[1:23:23] Heard a Voice a voice in the midst of
[1:23:26] the four Beast Jesus Christ say a
[1:23:29] measure of wheat for a penny three
[1:23:31] measures of barley for a penny see thou
[1:23:33] hurt not the oil and wine don't you
[1:23:34] touch mine those that belong to me
[1:23:39] amen Jesus is giving the
[1:23:42] devil a check on his authority a check
[1:23:45] on his ability to be able to overcome
[1:23:49] people at this time do this
[1:23:53] anointing God's standard is being raised
[1:23:56] always being raised now we come to
[1:23:58] leysia leysia church AG is the loosening
[1:24:01] of the Holy Ghost or in it in it the
[1:24:04] bright age birth forth come forth at
[1:24:08] this time the Holy Ghost now loosed
[1:24:11] finally from the bondage that it was
[1:24:13] under through all these dark ages the
[1:24:15] Holy Ghost now loosed and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] being loosed the Holy Ghost then began
[1:24:21] the the restoration of the gifts you had
[1:24:23] AA Street take place and all these and
[1:24:26] thank God in
[1:24:30] 1906 1906 brother Ram was born yes
[1:24:36] 1909 I forget the dates yeah I'm sorry
[1:24:39] 1906 was Aza 1909 brother Brandon was
[1:24:42] born a prophet to this age the leoda age
[1:24:46] which is simply in the scripture here
[1:24:49] represented by the by a black writer or
[1:24:52] by a pale horse rider which was all of
[1:24:55] these all accumulated into one piled up
[1:24:57] on this one age oh Hallelujah but God
[1:25:01] sending the anointing of the Flying
[1:25:03] Eagle like a flying eagle above the
[1:25:07] intelligence of man representing a bride
[1:25:10] for this day through the bride age that
[1:25:13] is going to take a
[1:25:14] rapture we still have now that same
[1:25:18] anointing again there's anointing over
[1:25:21] all the Earth Saints there's that
[1:25:23] anointing that we know the just fall the
[1:25:25] rain falls on just and unjust but there
[1:25:27] is a special significant anointing for
[1:25:30] the bride the bride that she's received
[1:25:33] in this day and thank God through the
[1:25:35] birth of a prophet a man that God could
[1:25:38] work through that for that gift of a
[1:25:40] prophecy that gift of a prophet to bring
[1:25:43] the word of God for this last days to
[1:25:46] take the bride through the revelation of
[1:25:48] the word to height she had never reached
[1:25:51] before re praise God thank God for
[1:25:55] bringing not just truth through a
[1:25:58] prophet but Revelation through the Holy
[1:26:01] Spirit to my heart so that I could see
[1:26:05] it so that it's a part of my life so
[1:26:07] that I could reach these Heights that we
[1:26:10] could go above higher than any place an
[1:26:13] eagle goes up and can see for hundreds
[1:26:15] of miles yes sir praise God nothing is
[1:26:21] impossible for this Hallelujah this
[1:26:23] standard that we are the standard
[1:26:25] bearers for takes us above every way
[1:26:29] that the Devil comes in like a flood and
[1:26:31] takes us beyond anything that the devil
[1:26:34] could bring to us or try to se us or
[1:26:36] deceive Us by oh a little sickness here
[1:26:39] or there that's one thing but sickness
[1:26:43] that's that's just as of the devil I'm
[1:26:46] talking about remember when Jesus said
[1:26:48] don't touch oil and wine he's telling
[1:26:50] them don't you uh they're they're dying
[1:26:53] in marma but don't you dare make them
[1:26:56] say hail mares and go deny the word
[1:26:59] right because that's the fundamental
[1:27:01] Foundation behind everything that God
[1:27:04] has done here and that is the that is
[1:27:07] the completion and the revelation of his
[1:27:09] word to his people in here through each
[1:27:14] one of these anointings God has a bride
[1:27:17] yes through every one of those ages even
[1:27:19] through the Dark Ages when they were
[1:27:21] specific Al
[1:27:23] anointed as Ox as Cales as burdens of
[1:27:28] bears of Burden even in there God was
[1:27:33] bringing his family bringing his
[1:27:35] children bringing his bride along to see
[1:27:39] that it's God that takes care of it and
[1:27:43] that bride is who goes in the Ramer
[1:27:45] right amen that anointing for the bride
[1:27:48] puts her in a Rapture not not not the
[1:27:51] church
[1:27:52] not the church nominal but the bride
[1:27:55] amen praise the Lord God has set in
[1:27:59] place the biggest difference that we
[1:28:01] have as for this bride this bride has
[1:28:05] found its place in Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:10] amen yes praise I got a couple quotes I
[1:28:13] can read to you here but I'm just going
[1:28:14] to forego those for now I'll read those
[1:28:18] next time amen let's stand if we could
[1:28:20] I'm going to stop there praise the Lord
[1:28:25] but now the
[1:28:27] thing just as a little before the next
[1:28:32] time we get on
[1:28:35] this when the bride leaves tribulation
[1:28:37] sets in actually brother B says Leo to
[1:28:40] see a church ages over apostasy takes
[1:28:42] over amen this bride
[1:28:47] leades but during that time remember
[1:28:49] this is the church ages
[1:28:52] the church ages ceased each one of these
[1:28:54] anointings is for the bride when the
[1:28:57] bride leaves brother Ram said Church
[1:28:58] ages in goes into
[1:29:01] apost these anointings will no longer be
[1:29:05] here during the
[1:29:07] tribulation everything that you read in
[1:29:09] the scripture everything that they go
[1:29:11] through during the tribulation friend
[1:29:13] there will be no anointing right they
[1:29:17] gave themselves in the Dark Ages what
[1:29:20] they went through they gave their lives
[1:29:23] they they they labored for that church
[1:29:25] for that age but even at that there was
[1:29:28] an anointing there for those people but
[1:29:30] friend if you're here during I heard
[1:29:32] I've heard people talk about well I'd be
[1:29:35] foolish virgin oh my you just you just
[1:29:38] don't know what you're
[1:29:39] saying right there will be no anointing
[1:29:42] for everything all of what's going on
[1:29:45] during the tribulation period there will
[1:29:46] be no anointing there will be no God
[1:29:49] here there will be no love there will be
[1:29:52] no uh purity of God to to to keep or to
[1:29:58] hold it's it's it's going to be a it's
[1:30:01] it's going to be a a horrible
[1:30:05] time God help us God help those who are
[1:30:10] remaining after the bride
[1:30:13] leaves because God is give us something
[1:30:16] to overcome all of it overcome every one
[1:30:19] of them amen amen praise the Lord thank
[1:30:22] God for his word thank God for the
[1:30:24] loosening of that spirit I mean I don't
[1:30:27] I don't mind

[1:30:32] during I didn't live during the Dark
[1:30:33] Ages I'm thankful I didn't have to watch
[1:30:35] my children pulled in tube but by
[1:30:38] elephants and their bodies thrown to the
[1:30:41] Lions and I don't I'm I'm glad I didn't
[1:30:43] live during that time but it's it's it's
[1:30:46] something that God gives us to
[1:30:48] understand though
[1:30:50] that they they they they were under that
[1:30:55] anointing it it was something that was
[1:30:58] just a part of them because of what they
