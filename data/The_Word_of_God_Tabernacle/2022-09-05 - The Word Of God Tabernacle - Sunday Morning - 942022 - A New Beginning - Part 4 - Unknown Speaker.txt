want prayer requests not let's just stand to our feet then we'll take you to the lord of prayer amen how many knows the lord hears you amen amen how many knows that this lord knows his request before they even became requests how many knows that the answer is already on the way amen but yeah he asked us to ask so that's what we do today we ask believing so brother tom if you pray for us please request brother i'd appreciate it heavenly father dear god we gather in the name of your precious son our lord and savior jesus christ yes yes lord lord we'd ask that you'd grant us a more of a revelation to know that you promised you'd never leave us in office say yes yes you're always present amen even though it seems day by day we have to make decisions may they be your decisions and make you make the path plain before us for it it is a dark world that we're in we see it getting darker and darker and you know that your prophet said it would be like this so it has to be like this he said that things would continue people's minds would go it would get more and more insane and certainly we see it we see it right in it from the president united states all the way down law the insanity and the reprobate minds that the people have and we thank you lord that we could come to you right now in the name of lord jesus christ and make our petitions known because you're a god that said cast all your cares upon me amen i care for you yes lord there's been many requests made already and you know the hearts that are here and and all the needs that are represented we're a needy people dear god yes we're sheep that definitely need a shepherd to guide us and lead us and yes father may you just reach out and touch those that jesus that need to touch right now in our assembly we know that you're a god that died for us and you've led for us and by your stripes we're healed and we're thankful lord that we can have this confidence know that when we pray that you hear us and yes you're not deaf to our prayers but you said pray that your needs may be answered and father we ask these things in the name of lord jesus christ and we're thankful that you're among us and yes lord that you love us and yes god we just ask you lord again that you give us more of a revelation to know that you do love us and you'll never believe us nor forsake us yes in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen praise the lord need to be seated if you'd like amen praise the lord so thankful i always always forget i get the prayer requests here and read them and look over them and i always forget but i'm sure you all remember but i appreciate your prayers for me too i leave this afternoon out of phoenix about seven o'clock get to minneapolis again at midnight so it's going

the lord amen tabitha's came back good a little low on iron but all is well heard the baby everything's going great so praise the lord so more prayer requests from last week the coming praise reports yes thank god let's stand to our feet if we could turn our bibles to genesis uh chapter one again genesis chapter one and we're going to start where uh we left off last week lord wheeling new beginning this will be part four and then you begin part four and then we'll start well we've been starting with genesis chapter one our first couple of verses of scripture here genesis 1 1 and 2. amen before we read the word let's just bow our heads for another prayer if you could precious jesus we're very thankful lord again for another day for life for health for strength for the blessings you give us father every day lord for the precious blood that you shed at calvary that still sets on that mercy seat today making intercession on our behalf lord taking our place so that we could take yours and be robbed in your righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish justified as though we had never done it in the first place trusting by you god that lord all the the mistakes the faults the failures the sins lord no longer accounted lord to us but may they go to the head of satan where they lay till the day of judgment that he's held accountable for all that is done and the wickedness in this world and the things of this life we thank you lord for this time lord for the blessing for giving us this opportunity to come to your house once again thank you for the desire in our hearts lord to again have the desire to be here lord and what you do for us every day and what you're doing for us in this service may your holy spirit move in a special way now god speak to us from your word may the holy spirit have its preeminence lord as we rebuke every demonic spirit that we try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you lord jesus get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here today thank you for these people that have come lord for those who may be streaming lord but most of all we're very thankful for you god because without you being here we just we could just go to the restaurant have a meal or have some kind of social gathering father but when you're here lives change things are different lord everything is is is made new fresh god faith and belief and lord you heal the sick and you you bless the downtrodden and you lift us up and encourage us and grant us with the blessings that we need once again through your word lord may it bring faith because faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god faith enrapturing faith for this last day that we live lord yes may you bless each one lord bless the reading of your word now as we commit into your hands use me to speak whatever your perfect will would be said yes we'll commit it all to you and ask your blessings on it and give you thanks for it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen genesis chapter one verses one and two amen in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters amen you could be seated if you'd like i'm gonna go over to back to leviticus chapter 23 where we left off last week and we want to uh bring in some of the types shadows from the old testament uh from the the jewish feasts as we had uh entered into or talked about last week that seventh feast that last feast entering into that eighth day and entering into that rest the rest that the lord promised us the rest that we looked to that god showed us after the andalumian flood with the naming of noah which meant rest and of course when jesus came in that next new beginning and he said come on unto me all you labor heavy laden and i'll give you rest and we know of course we're heading to a place a millennium that is a thousand years of rest and it's a rest period we know we'll be planting and building and things like that but it'll still be a rest why will it be a rest because our adversary will be chained a thousand years you'll have we'll have no tempter then amen will be a time of rest to be a time of reprieve that the lord gives us that thousand years the breaking of that original sin that man lives on this earth a thousand years still a period of time a type of the finishing of that seventh day before it enters into that eighth day rest that perfect rest amen of the eighth day but it is a it is that rest period that we have amen and showing us today that we should have that rest today because our rest is the holy ghost yeah we rest in the holy ghost if you've been born again you have the spirit of god or the holy ghost god lives in you then you have that rest because you know that you have that that assurance that as god has sealed that holy spirit in you and he has sealed the devil out you are sealed until your eternal destination well if you're sealed by the holy ghost and god's gave you that promise and accepted you then we know that we essentially as brother branham taught us are already there amen by god's promise we can believe now if god's not as good as his word then we can't trust in that but if god is as good as his promised word then we can trust and believe as his word has told us that as he has sealed us that we are there we rest in that that's our rest don't matter what goes on what the satan tries to do what the devil the turmoil all the things of the world brother tom and his prayer and the world is falling and it's turned upside down and and a world that has fallen apart he used to preach a message the world falling apart uh that message has changed it has become a world fallen apart it is past tense now it has fallen apart but regardless of that we rest we're rested and we rest in his word we rest in his promise because he's given us that rest that we know that romans 8 28 all things work together for our good because we love him amen that's our arrest now getting into these these these feast days going back to the first now i know we talked about the feast of the tabernacles last week and the last one that brought us into that eighth day and that rest but i want to go back to the first and look through uh these feasts to type them not only to uh those as the theme of ours messages here is the new beginning and like i said this is the new beginning part four uh but it's also a typing of the uh from from god showing us in these feasts what he was going to do and what he has done for us his gentile bride every one of these feasts is a type of christ every one of them god giving these feasts to the to the jews so that they could see that what they were doing was going to happen to us in a spiritual uh in a spiritual sense god's sending his own son jesus so uh as we read this let's look for just a second now these feasts a feast basically means the meanings obviously changed over time we think of a feast today it's probably a little different than what god is giving them as a feast it is not necessarily a time to come together with cakes and cookies and candy and celebration of balloons and uh the kind of feast that we think about today but uh gorging on food or something like that uh these feasts that god give to them was was for a sacredness it was for a sacred season a sacred period a sacred time and a sacred place that that god had that it was to be an honor that god was going to honor his children and his children were going gonna honor him through these feasts so as we say feast and we think in our minds it's not that uh that type of feast it's it's something that god set aside for them to be a sacred period uh a sacred period of time or place and and uh and season for them uh so let's as we go through them let's look we'll go through one at a time and and see how they typify christ and how they show us uh christ in in us and in through the church ages and where we are today amen now um let's just go down to the fourth verse the first three verses just talks about god telling moses to tell them about the feast but in the first feast is the feast of the passover god says these are the feasts of the lord even holy convocations we talked about what that holy convocation was remember it's a holy gathering a sacred gathering holy place consecrated of god consecrated of his people of that convocation it's a gathering together of people together like-minded people amen just like there's the gathering that's going on today there's a gathering going on right now i know there'll be a gathering on the other side for him but there's a gathering right now and it's not the gathering in the word of god tabernacle or in tucson or in the united states it's a gathering internationally of god's bride under the auspice of the shed blood of christ that gathering is going on right now holy convocation uh even holy convocations which ye shall proclaim in their seasons and the 14th day of the first month at even is the lord's passover now the passover we could obviously understand and recognize the passover the paschal lamb typifying jesus christ of course but it also becomes the foundation upon all of what these feasts were based on and all of what the christians experience is in our whole experience is based in the typification of this passover christ being our paschal lamb as redemption to us it is that redemption christ is our passover it is redemption to us man and regardless of anything else statue of a perfect man or walking with god or coming to church or whatever you do in your life without redemption none of it matters you go nowhere with god if there weren't first redemption because redemption is what brought us back to him it was redeeming us back remember the old pawnshop redeeming us back to our proper position mankind had fallen from where it was supposed to be in god's original creation the garden of eden redemption was to bring man back to redeem him back to that place it's a place or a state of of god performing the act of perpetuation you may have heard me say several times uh of that act of perpetuation think well what brother you what is what does that mean to perpetuate it means that you're taking someone else's place the act of perpetuation means that god took our place in the act of redemption that god showed to them through the process of the bulls and goats he showed us through sending his only son jesus christ to bring redemption to us so that that perpetuation would come and he would take our place not only would he take our place but he took our place so we could take his yes amen he took our place he became our perpetuation he went to calgary for us he take he took our sins upon himself he became that sacrificial lamb he became that passover that paschal lamb and perpetuated for us so that we now in his place could be robed in his righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish you think how could this bribe how could we humans if we go through this life end up at the end of this without a spot wrinkle or blemish walk through this life without a single accusation against you satan will certainly try to but there's not an accusation laid to your feet laid to god's feet of you because it's been annihilated he has perpetuated that the passover the redemption the the the taking of our place the taking of our sin means that we now are are in his place road in his righteousness well in his righteousness there are no spots in his righteousness there are no wrinkles there are no blemishes well if we're standing robed in his righteousness and friend you are just as righteous as god is righteous amen because we're in his righteousness through this and without that friend none of the other christian experience matters without redemption without that passover without that paschal lamb without him having taken our place then none of it would matter we'd still all be sinners we would still all be a cannon fodder headed to hell if he had not come and redeemed us and took our place that that paschal lamb it took our place that redemption that redeemed us to ourselves now look at this as we climb upward the very next day okay this is to me this is beautiful because it's the very next day notice the first day is the 14th first of the month of first month 14th day but now on the 15th day the very next day is the feast of unleavened bread which means the communion and fellowship that we have with the lord redemption brought fellowship praise god the very next day it didn't take months after he redeemed you it didn't take years after he redeemed you when he regains you you come in complete fellowship with him right then the very next day praise the lord let's read it on the 15th day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread and that is of course tip of pfizer represents our communion or our fellowship with him amen you know a lot of times i i don't i don't actually call our as we call communion service communion i call it the lord's supper because really communion's not uh taking of the bread or the wine in just one two three four days out of the year communion with us and fellowship with us with him is every day every moment every second we have is fellowship and communion with the lord jesus with your mind with your heart with your mouth his fellowship is continual communion with the lord this unleavened bread just represents the oneness that we've come together with him in a union amen now there's a greater oneness through these that we're going to talk about but that's the beginning of it god redeems you to have fellowship with you god brought you back where you were supposed to be because god couldn't have it or never in the garden of eden when man failed god could no longer come to adam with life to ear there was a great castle between god and man that great chasm that was thrown that sin chasm that was thrown between god and man god was no longer able to come even with the sheepskin on and speak lift the ear like he did with adam before that couldn't no longer do it so there had to be that perfect perpetuation that bloody bridge that that bridged that gap so man and god could come back in fellowship again this was a beautiful time saint to understand it that we now have the ability to be able to have that type of communion and fellowship with the lord again praise the lord in the first day you shall have a holy complication shall do no several work therein but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days in the seventh day is a holy convocation ye shall do no several work therein now third one now this is the main thing i really want to get to uh the third and fourth for probably most of the rest of this service ninth verse and the lord spake unto moses say speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest now there's the there's the redemption the passover there's the uh the fellowship the feast of unleavened bread the communion together now there's the now those were specific months now you notice here there's not a specific month or day god's just telling here now when you come into the land that i have promised you when you have planted and reached your first harvest you take of the reaping of the first of that first harvest you bundle it together and you offer it as a waving by the priest before the lord as a thanksgiving to god as an offering to god for the blessings and the bountifulness that he has given you and the harvest now that first fruit is only the first one that came to maturity wasn't the entire harvest it was just the first to come to maturity now look it doesn't say a day or time but it says at the at the time when that comes to maturity when it comes to the place that this harvest has reached a place of maturity or that part of the harvest as you begin to reap it that harvest that's come to a place of maturity a place that that that wheat or whatever it is can be a processed and eaten maturity i give to you shall reap the heart then shall you bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest now the first fruits is just simply again that part of that harvest that has come to maturity it has come to a place that it can be eaten come to a place that it can be of use amen just like if uh if you go to a citrus tree here or an apple tree or something you see a uh one hanging from a branch you look at it and say well that's not right you're not gonna pick it because it's not right many times joel will go around into our apartments and we have orange trees and grapefruit trees and we'll look at it and uh you'll look say well that that's not ready to be picked yet we'll look to say that's not mature that fruit's not ready to be eaten but when it gets to the place that it's ready to be eaten that's when you can pluck it cut it eat it that first fruit is just the one that came to maturity first the first one that came to that place now sheep is just simply a a taking of those first fruits and a binding of those together we just say the stalks of wheat biting those together loosely binding those together each one of the stalks all separate stalks now but they're bound together with a with a common thread oh with with a common rope or whatever it was they bound them with they bound these sheaves loosely bound together was that sheep and that sheath he shall wave the sheath before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the after the sabbath the priest shall waive it wave it before the lord amen as a thanksgiving to the lord thank you lord for this harvest we give this sheaf back to you lord as i thank you for what you've done for us it's a sort of a type even of tithing that the lord has blessed you and you give a small portion of it back as god has blessed you you say lord i give this back to you this is an honor to you and this is the thanks to you for what you've done for me what you've done for my family what you've done for us lord i'm just offering this back to you and the priest takes it and he waves it amen you say well the priests don't need it doesn't matter what the precedes that's god's directions god says take it and it's for the priest to do it's his instruction to take it he's just the facilitator of it amen the advantage between the people and god the priest is the facilitator to take in way before the lord and say okay god this and it became a sweet smelling savior to god because it was a representation of our honoring to god and our thankfulness for what god has done for us amen we do it today we offer up spiritual sacrifices to the lord all the time the first to come to maturity now let's finish this because it was the first to come to maturity even in this day that we live amen way before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow at the the the after the sabbath the priest shall wave it and ye shall offer now look at the rest of this offering okay because the wave sheet the first to come to maturity we know was jesus amen was was way before the lord for the people amen he was hung up on the cross of calvary came to maturity first he was just the first one he was just the first fruits the the one that was the representative of it now we're going to talk about that in a minute because actually this first fruit represents the resurrection uh the resurrection of the seed that had been buried in the ground and come forth and raised up it was a typification of jesus christ who was the first one jesus christ was he was the first one to raise but notice this we're going to continue reading of the other that god gave to them so that we could see today the significance of christ and and what god was doing even for them back in leviticus for the showing of the coming of christ his only son look here now and yeshua 12 first and ye shall offer that day when you wave the sheath and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the lord also typification of christ and the meat offering thereof shall be too tense deal of fine flour again same mingled mingled look at this now this fine flower is now mingled with oil the sheath look at the sheath the sheath was binding together a loosely binding together of individual stalks they became one unit but they were still all individual stocks notice the fine flour the fine flour is simply mingled with oil what do we know oil is oil is the holy ghost represented in the scripture oil is the holy spirit this fine flower is simply mingled with that oil okay now an offering made by fire unto the lord for a sweet savior and the drink offering shall thereof shall be of wine the fourth part of an hen and ye shall eat neither bread nor parts corn nor green ears until the self same day that you have brought an offering unto your god it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings now this raising from the dead this sea that was in the ground that came forth that was given to the lord that was showing the the resurrection brings us to first corinthians i've got a couple scriptures i want to read hold your place so we're going back to leviticus 23 but i got a couple scriptures i want to read before we get back there first corinthians chapter 15. first corinthians chapter 15. now there's so many associate scriptures that really goes in the new testament with these feast days um and i could have taken three or four sundays and probably brought every one of them out uh but i just picked one or two here or there to try to hit some highlights of it and help and maybe if you watch it later write some notes or go back and study you can look and see for yourself but now in first corinthians chapter 15 20th verse first corinthians 15 20. but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept amen christ the firstfruits what the first one to come to maturity amen for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive why because he's the first fruits of them that sleep bringing life resurrection but every man in his own order christ the first fruits afterward they that are christ at his coming he was just the first the first of many to come along behind him so he rose from the dead but he rose from the dead for what purpose because we were in him because heroes we rose with him amen first thessalonians chapter 4 first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus will god bring with him amen god didn't have to do that he's god he did it for us he became the first fruits for us he took our sin for for us it all that he did was for us it's amazing it seems like how selfish humanity has gotten today then almost everything we seem to do anymore is for ourselves or for at least at the most for our four or r4 no more but every single thing that jesus did he did for you yeah he did for others he did for us he became the first fruits not for himself but for us for if we believe that jesus died and rose again amen even so then which also sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remaining to the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout of the voice of the archangel the trump of god the dead of christ shall rise first amen why because he already has risen because he's risen we are risen then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up uh shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord amen that fruit that first fruit feast the first to maturity the first to resurrect the first to come forth but now look even in that the wave sheet god takes it a step further we go from redemption to communion to first fruit from from not even being a people to god taking and redeeming us to himself having communion and fellowshipping with us and dying and raising from the dead for us so that we could raise with him amen but now look what happens after the feast of the first fruits 15th verse the fourth one now the fourth feast is the feast of the waveloads the feast of the wavelobes fifteenth first and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath from the day that ye brought the sheep of the wave offering seven sabbaths shall be complete seven sabbaths shall be complete now that means that from the time now let's read it again ye shall count unto you from the day of the morrow after the sabbath now that's when the when the priest here on the tomorrow 11th first after the sabbath she the the priest shall waive it okay now in the feast of the waveloaves there's still not a month there's still not a day but look at the timing of it after that she count unto you for tomorrow after the sabbath from the day after the at the you brought the sheep of the wave offering seven sabbaths are complete so 49 days basically is what god's telling them this from the beginning to the end is 49 days seven sabbath shall bring this to a completion and immediately after that remember now 49 or the sabbath is is the ending of the week but our eighth day eternity our new beginning is the next day remember just like our sunday just like today amen our week begins today and what better way to begin it than in church honoring the resurrection of christ who also again rose on the third day on sunday the eighth day first day of the week the new beginning as he did he does for us now seven sabbaths so after that now look what he says in the 16th verse even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath so again after the seventh sabbath seven sevenths we know seven is completion after the seven seven seventh sabbath 49 days is the 50th day or the next day or as we know the beginning of the week the eighth day again typical of that rolling over into eternity from time into eternity because remember as the jews were as the jews were commanded to keep these feasts as it was it should have been their desire to keep these feasts in honor of the lord these things by the old law were changed you want to say pass away changed when christ came and gave his life and came and lived in us and and then the law to us changed just like brother branham said change from one form to another now those that live by the law they have to obey the law live by the law amen but we live by christ amen no we live by christ christ is the law amen so it's not done away with but it's changed it's enhanced it's come to us to work being born again christians being holy ghost filled that law is something that's not a day or a time or a sabbath or a new moon or any of that it's become life to us because it's not it's not a matter of something that you and your flesh try to accomplish is something that by the spirit of god living in you you just become amen it's just who you are you don't obey the law because you're afraid of the penalty you don't obey the law for any reason you live the law you live the word amen you live the word let's just say word how's that law scares people when you say that three-letter word especially in the scripture people get scared to death they talk about la la la it scares you to death but let's talk about word then you obey the word you don't obey the word because you're afraid of the penalty you obey the word because you become the word you don't obey the word you live the word because you've become the word see it changes now for some it doesn't those who are not born again and you don't have the holy ghost and that's what you want your life to be and you want to meet it out and say well i think god will be okay with this and i think i can get away with this and whatever then you go right ahead because you go to live by the law then you'll have to suffer the consequences of the law but i want to live by his grace and his grace with his spirit in me tells me that i do what i do because i love him not because i'm scared of him i do it because i love him amen i do it because i love him because i become that i live that because i've become that see that's how the law changed it lives through the bride amen it lives to us we obey it because we want to obey it it's our life to obey now when it comes to these feasts like this we don't have these same feasts not written in the scripture like this but we obey and live the same feast but in the spiritual sense of christ now all of this parenthetical of christ going through is now living in us we just live it out because he's in us he's every bit of it anyway if he's every bit of it i'm every bit of it i live it because it's who i am now i do it praise the lord i don't take lambs i don't take fine flour i don't take and do all these things that they had to do because it has passed from death and to life we are living in life now amen living in life they were living to get by with what was acceptable to god we live life because we're living it and have it more abundantly praise the lord look at this seven sabbaths the day after the sabbath remember the new beginning the new day the first day rolling over into eternity after the seven sevens shall you number 50 days and he shall offer a new meat offering unto the lord now 50 days now what does 50 tell you obviously it tells you that's the number of pentecost 50th pentecost 50 is the exact days between the resurrection of christ and the and the formation of the church in the upper room when god sent the holy spirit down 50 days 50 days pentecost from the time of the first fruits to the time of the wave loaves 50 days the same as when christ raised and they were in the upper room and the holy spirit fell on them and he filled him with the holy spirit 50 days remember everything about it fulfilled by christ the new beginning that christ did when he rose from the dead began that time remember on that after that seven sabbaths amen there was that old bc time after that was now the 50 days 50 days from the time of the resurrection to the pentecost was the wave sheep now in this pentecostal feast waving of the sheep let's look at this for a minute because remember what you had in the first fruits you had loosely bound together individual stalks that were offered to god you had fine flour that was just mingled with oil but now look at what the wave loaf is ye shall bring out 17th first of your habitations two waveloads of two tenths deals they shall be a fine flower and they shall be bacon with leaven now these aren't loosely bound together individual stalks this is not fine flour that's just mingled with oil now you've got on this feast of pentecost on the day of pentecost when the holy spirit came and the holy ghost and fire came into you it galvanized the two of you together christ and his bride became one amen it's no longer loose least of individual stalks it is one yes christ and his bride are not one it is no longer just mingled with oil although a lot of people uh live under that mingling uh you realize that you see a lot of times the the screaming the shouting and even sometimes the tongues and things like all that's just the operation of the spirit of god that does not mean that person is born again does not mean that person predestinated does not mean that person is going to heaven it does not mean any of those things gifts and callings are without repentance it purely means that the anointing of the holy spirit is still going around and and is still evident in the gentiles and they feel that anointing people get under that anointing and tap into that anointing doesn't mean they're bright just means you're tapping into that anointing the rain falls on the just and the unjust the rain falls on the tares just as much as it falls on the wheat maybe sometimes more doesn't mean they're bright does they mean they're right with god right now this brother branham talked about being in foreign lands and devils and demons and putting swords through and running water water through their bodies and laying a pencil down and see that pencil get up by itself and write in an unknown tongue see you can't tell me that that's that that is somebody that's that is born against a christian these are hidden people but they do it under the operation that god has given that anointing that spirit they do it under that same spirit the false anointed ones that people today still do the same they're just mingled with that oil that oil hasn't become baked in them it hasn't become one in fellowship and in union with christ it's just a mingling look at the day of pentecost what happened here acts chapter 2 let's read it again i like reading this acts chapter 2. we'll begin reading with verse 1. acts 2 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come notice that word those words fully come we may entertain those two words again in the future but a lot of times we get in our minds when we try to reason with the word and with the message we get in our minds that something is is like an absolute especially in the seals uh it's almost as if people would think that uh the sixth seal is going to be on one day the sixth seal was when brother brown preached it in march of 1963 or something to that effect oh it's just it's just this and it's cut and dry but notice and there's more places than this but notice that there's things that god and in matthew 24 that god brings into presence into existence brings and shows that this wave of that spirit is moving but it's not to the place of the fullness of it quite yet you could take since i've already said it and i'll delve into it just a minute let's just take the sixth seal how many beliefs a sixth seal has been unleashed now don't lift your hand or anything but think about it remember the sixth seal is tribulation judgment now when i put in that context how many belief judgments in the world today amen but they get it things get all scrupled when you say well six seal six seals judgment amen you could never convince me there's not judgment going on in the world today there absolutely is god's still sending warning but judgment is here but the sixth seal hasn't fully released itself yet right it won't until the tribulation the bride will be gone yes amen when the day of pentecost anyway when the day of pentecost was fully come well what does that mean well it means it started somewhere and it come to a place of completion it come to where it was fully in its maturity in its place where god was bringing it from to where he's bringing it to those that are here during the tribulation could probably say the same thing about the sixth symbol it is fully come as chaos goes on around them or whatever i don't plan to be here so uh don't study too much on it but it is gonna happen yes but i believe it's it is also unveiling itself and happening now it has it has unleashed itself and it's coming forth right now amen get it won't fully come until the bride's gone but when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with uh all with one accord in one place like the sheaves they were all in the upper room they were all loosely gathered together in this one room as individual stalks together and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting praise the lord i totally said that earlier i like that part amen filled all the house not just you but the whole house amen i believe this spirit of god could be so powerful anybody come through that door would knock them back just to feel the presence of almighty god amen that presence that you bask in filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them now you've got the fine flower that's mingled with oil the spirit of god came and it sat upon them but that's not a new birth a new birth is not a sitting upon a baptism is not a sitting upon it's an immersion it's a complete immersion of something not just a sprinkling not just a pouring not just an anointing or a dabbing of something but it's a complete immersion of that spirit but when the spirit of god came and it sat upon them that was just the first fruit that that was just the honoring of the resurrection of god proving himself that he came back on the day of pentecost and just came on them but look what happened next and they were all filled with the holy ghost so not only did the spirit of god come on them as in the first fruits it came in them and they were all filled with the holy ghost the holy ghost and fire that took that fine flower and oil and baked them both together now you may have at some point during that first fruit taking that fine flour and that oil and maybe separated the two again but the two are baked together now you cannot separate them they have become one amen christ and his bride through the holy spirit anointing that baptism coming and galvanizing the bride and christ together as one now she's one with him this is the promise that god showed them back in in the fourth feast the wave offering the waveloaf was showing that christ was going to come 50 days from the time of the resurrection to the time of the wavelok was god going to prove himself on that day of pentecost by not only coming on them but in them praise the lord now that's a problem a lot of people have they stop with that on them part and they feel that anointing and it feels good it feels good that the anointing of god feels good they feel like a little tingle up their spine or a little gift manifests itself and they're like i got it no you don't got it till it comes in you and when it comes in you you become him yes and when you become him you live like him yes you punctuate every word of god with the name and yes you receive the word to yourself and when you receive it it becomes who you are yes amen when you receive something it's you now it's part of who you are when you see when you receive a bite of morsel of food in your mouth that from the time it hits your lips that that morsel food becomes a part of you you've received it you've ingested it praise the lord when god came at that time and they received him they became one with him just like the wavelok became one baked together neither one unit one unit you can't separate them you can't separate christ from his bride no more than you can separate the sun from light yes amen look let's continue to read this now they both become one christ and his pride become one two whey blows two tin steels they shall be a fine flower shall they bacon with leaven again still actually still showing the sinful nature of the human flesh amen not the soul anymore soul cannot sin right but the the sinful nation of the human flesh there's leaven they are the first fruits they are the first fruits unto the lord and ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year and one young bullock and two realms they shall be for a burnt offering unto the lord with their meat offering and their drink offerings even an offering made by fire of sweet savior unto the lord then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offers and every one of these has that spiritual significance to it we're just not going to that today for that's not really the subject that we're working on we're looking at that new beginning the new beginning the one that we just talked about we just read about pentecost the new beginning acts 2 1 1-3 the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the lord with the two lambs it shall be holy to the lord for the priest and he shall proclaim on the self same day that it may be unholy convocation unto you ye shall do no several work therein it shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations and when you reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of the field when thou reapest neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of the harvest thou shalt leave them unto the poor and to the stranger i am the lord your god now look at this i'll read this for a moment see what time we're at here now future home brother branham says this now if if you i talked about future home in this the this whole series and uh i hope maybe you've had a time to listen to some of it uh this that we're going through today brother branham really emphasizes in the feast of the trumpet now feast of the trumpets of course dealing with the next feast that we're about to get into um hopefully if we have another minute uh that that feast he wanted to brother madam wanted to take uh a week of services like he did the uh the seals and all and the church ages and and bring those seven trumpets and then right before he's getting ready to get a place the lord spoke to him and said this is to the jews amen those seven trumpets feasted the trumpets was to the jews so brother branham came along right after that and he preached a message called feast of trumpets and he goes probably maybe in a little more detail on some of it than i did because again that's not the theme of this message uh but it's a good message to listen to if you have never heard it a little it's not as lengthy as future home it is still sort of lengthy but not as lengthy as that one but it'll bless you amen and i will tell you the feast of trumpets is good to read uh this scripture as we're going over now and and listen to it you i think i've told y'all i don't listen to the messages ground as as a background noise or whatever and it's okay if you do i'm not saying don't do that i just don't do it if i listen to the message i'm listening to it uh the worst probably the most place i'm ever distracted listening to the message is if it's playing in my car and i'm driving other than that i'm usually listening like at my desk or something i'm listening and i'm following because i like reading and listening at the same time following it through but take time pour through it don't just don't just say well you know brother mutant mentioned this and not listen no put it on there and take time and pour over it uh if you got time if you just do a half hour a day or something and write notes or something and look and listen because brother branham really goes back and forth between the seals and the trumpets and uh and these feasts and if you're not following it can get a little confusing but if you go listen to it and i advise it if you haven't already even listen to it and just take time just take your time i had to do that uh take time i listened to it even in the car and i rewind rewind what do you say there well how did that and sometimes there's a couple times just be honest there's a couple times brother branham kind of mixes up the seals and the trumpets and he says sixth seal and he meant sex trumpet or something like that but it's easy to follow if you go along with it many many times most of the time he corrects that but um listen to it but listen closely okay don't just listen and say well uh you know i'll just take time and do this it's not homework this you're not going to be graded you're not going to be disciplined if you don't do it but just take your time but in future home i did want to read this quote in future home and notice after 50 days or seven sabbas from there again 50 days he's reading the seven sabbaths of when it's completed of when that feast of the first fruits is completed is that seven sabbaths after that that next day's the 50 days there come another holy convocation what happened the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost on the eighth day new beginning eighth day fell on the eighth day this that spirit fell on the eighth day was the seventh sabbath later exactly after his resurrection 50 days so i've been seven times that again bring back around uh to the first day of the week again seven times each time beginning holding over finishing its completion going back into that first day amen but when it gets to this new beginning we're talking about that last eighth day it rolls over into eternity not the beginning of a new week then after the millennium white throne judgment enters into enters into eternity in the new city that we're eventually gonna get to there there's your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal thing listen now the literal thing what's he talking about these feasts were reading nothing to do with the literal thing it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of god with eternal life that's where thou that's where the gentiles enter into that promise that's where we plug and place ourselves into that word amen it's taken us beyond that how by christ by the death burial resurrection of jesus christ yes not the literal thing it's beyond that it's the kingdom of god with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start who is he talking about yes he's talking about you he's talking about me mine it never started on any day now you wasn't saved on any day you was always there yes why because you're part of god yes well if you're a part of god you're just as eternal as he is in fact the only part of you that can't be eternal is that part of god who you are yes amen the only way you can be eternal because the only thing that's eternal is god amen so that's who that's who we really are now you as always saved jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from before the foundation of the world and that's when your eternal life had to begin with eternal life what we're recognizing now is just pointing us back to that reality what we're seeing in the scripture what we're looking at and god sending a prophet thank god that we can see that is just pointing us back to what we realize now where we came from and who we are we're who we are where we're going see so many times we focus on where we've been and where we're going and we forget what god's doing right now yes who we are right now what is happening right now right amen it's just as important things it's hard to recognize who you are unless you recognize the day and hour you're living scripturally and once you see that there's nothing just nobody can take it from you amen and when the word gets preached and god begins to reveal himself and you say oh praise the lord there i am there it is that's me where am i i'm still in him because we've been come we've become one brother adam says god and man heaven and earth have embraced heaven and earth i believe is one place even said heaven and earth have kissed they've embraced they've come together one again unity in a love affair praise the lord you can't separate them anymore you could the son from life amen i'm going to read this i'll close here in just a minute but let's go to the next one just real quick i actually had this one for the next service but we got a few more minutes um still in leviticus 23 23rd verse leviticus 23 23. now and the lord spake unto moses saying speaking of the children of israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall ye have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation now we know they're all holy convocations gathering places sacredness but now god's gone back to the time element now we're in the seventh month so the first two were the first month 14th and 15th day now we're in the seventh month the seventh month the first day of the seventh month which i think actually is october our seventh is july there it'd be i believe it's october first day for them is april or the first month excuse me would be april we believe october so the seventh so now we're in the seventh the seventh month first day of the seventh month is a memorial of the blowing of trumpets he shall do no several work therein but he shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord what are these trumpets these trumpets do what all through the scripture all through the old testaments even in the scripture we just read about the rapture there's a trumpet that sounds is what it's a calling together of a people is to bring a people together for a purpose common a common goal and purpose and these seven trumpets were to bring the the the jews all back to their homeland again back after pentecost and the dispersion by rome sent the jews all over the world but there had to be a trumpet sound of a hitler there had to be a trumpet sound of a stall and a trumpet to to draw these jews back to their homeland to bring the jews back to their promised land amen because that's the only place that the jews are blessed the only place that god deals with his people is in their homeland when they were dispersed he did not deal with them but now i want to point you to something before i get into that because we can save that for next time but notice as we get to this point um i had that quote i don't i'm not sure what i did with it but look from that time of the waveloke to the time of the blowing of the trumpets was a significant period of time you've gone from the first month to the seventh month now all of a sudden you've had the first feast second feast third feast four feet and now there's this long period of time between that time of the blowing of the waving of the wavelobe to the blowing of the trumpets you had one two three four bam just like that and now all of a sudden you've got this long period of time now you're going into the seventh month this long period of time which is parenthetical of the seven church ages because as god came on the day of pentecost with the feast of pentecost god's anointing went from the gent from the jews to the gentiles god then began to as he blinded them as we probably will get to not today but god blinded them that they would not see the messiah when he came but the gentiles received it the gentiles believed it and for the never the next 2 000 years seven church ages god's anointing has been on the gentile not the jew right the jew has been going along for 2 000 years just exactly like they've been going through the scripture that we're just reading and all their feast days and their sacrifices all that they do that the the jews and the law and living by the law and what they've done they they they just they did not recognize the messiah so they've been living by the law all through this time while god's anointing the holy spirit has been on the gentile bride through this long period of time but now at the end of god dealing with the gentiles remember we've said this many times the anointing the spirit of god begins to lift off of the gentiles and starts going back to the jews i believe that's already happened or again we're in the process of that happening i don't believe that time has fully come i don't believe that time will fully come until the gentile bride is gone when the gentile bride is gone and raptures she's no longer here the spirit of god will be fully on the jews yes amen as those trumpets have blown to bring dispersed israel back to their homeland again so as as them being in their homeland just in this church age as we call it church aids not church age to them but just in our church age that those trumpets have been blown i didn't want to get in this today but i'll just say and brother branham says all of those trumpets sounded under the sixth seal so now if there was a if there was a gathering together of dispersed israel and the sixth seal has not already began to unleash itself then where are we right if all those trumpets to the jews to gather them back to their homeland has not happened which we know it has then where are we if it's not if it's all blown under the sixth seal continuing when it comes to its fullness after the bride's gone god deals with them god deals with the jews he got revelation 11 and all the two witnesses and the things that god does and they realize who he is and they they put on sackcloth and ashes they separate themselves one family from the other and they say where did you get those scars and he said in the house of my friends that's at the end of the tribulation which i'm getting ahead of myself but that's at the end of the tribulation at the end of the marriage supper we go and have three and a half years a marriage supper of the lamb with him and at the end god slips away and comes and reveals himself to his people he couldn't do that unless they were already gathered in their homeland because he doesn't deal with them unless they're in their homeland the feast of the trumpets was to bring them back together that's the ending of the gentile dispensation the beginning of it was the waveloke that was the beginning of the gentile dispensation the day or feast of pentecost as we know it it's the feast of waveload for them feast of pentecost for us that was the beginning of that now it's winding up we're at the end of it things we know that we all know we're at the ending of that we're at the time where this spirit is that that anointing is lifting off the gentiles and it's going back to the jews this headed that way now is god still dealing with his people absolutely yes amen is god still dealing with us is he still dealing with agenda absolutely is amen for this period of time but you can tell i know just in my lifetime from when i was a kid when i was gabriel or joel's age and i remember services i went to friend they were greatly different let's just put it that way i don't want to say they were better uh although that's probably an appropriate word uh they were very different i've told you before i remember when i was again joel gabriel's age i remember being in the back of the church and seeing look like smoke milky white over the whole congregation over the whole church i mean so much so the presence of god so powerful there that you could hardly even see the man standing behind the pulpit that's how powerful it was yes amen sisters dance around the spirit of god moving so powerfully beautiful sisters uncut hair flowing down the the bobby pins i could have started a bobby pin factory uh bobby said pen selling business i if i was a little kid selected all the bobby pins they're on the floor at that time is incredible i i'm not exaggerating just from the power of god the spirit of god living and even as a little boy i knew there was something it was something different friend you can i grew up in a baptist church and this was no baptist church but you knew the difference wasn't just another church it was the presence of god right a lot of times people just want a different church no no the difference comes when god comes not from the door to door name the name denomination nomination church the church pastor pastor it changes when god comes amen and just from that time i remember and how it's as now we feel the power of god move here very strong but from those days i've seen it wane and lived and kind of almost to the point not completely gone again it won't be completely gone until we're completely gone then he deals with the jews feast of the trump has gathered them the jews back to their homeland amen so that god can begin to deal with them the jews are never blessed unless they're in their homeland god does not deal with the jews unless they're in their homeland god does not deal with us unless we are in our homeland amen and you know where our homeland is it's in him the holy ghost is our canaan land the holy ghost is our homeland that's where we are blessed that's where god deals with us in the holy spirit if you're not in him well he doesn't deal with you if you're not in him i don't know that you're even one of his but we're in him right he deals he blesses when you're in when they're in their homeland amen he blesses them praise the lord amen let's stand i'm gonna stop here it's the blessings of god that are bringing us to that new beginning heavens and earth will pass away with change from one form to another but his word cannot pass away amen praise the lord let's sing this course 5 48 amen before we go today he's from glory to glory he's changing me amen more in his image

we hit on and we'll talk about again is false anointed ones amen so you want to go listen to that one too this is the false anointed ones the false anointing ones at the end time you'll see about that what we were talking about pentecost just didn't have time to break it down necessarily like i like to but uh that on that anointing and then the tears the weak you'll see comes confusing to some people sometimes how how can this be and how can this person say that or do that but they just operate under that anointing doesn't mean they're a child of god right amen right praise the lord false anointing ones at the end time amen amen praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord today yes and we love each one of you appreciate you amen god's so good to us amen happy birthday to alice
