handle that for me so i can't even get a bunch of text up here so she usually tries to take care of the people in the streaming so thank you thank the lord for that so sing it with me amen we'll do our best to worship the [Music] through the lord darkness [Music] by [Music] and faith his eyes are watching me [Music] the sails [Music] as i face the raging [Music] oh i've had visions i've had dreams i've even held them in my hands but i never knew those streams could slip right through like they were only great [Music] though the sheep is [Music] will i have fallen on my knees as i face the raging sea but the anger holds [Music] [Music] now i have been young [Music] but i'm older now and there has been beauty these eyes have [Music] but it was in the night when i faced the storms of my life but that's where god's proof is though the ship gets fatter the anchor holes the sails are torn i have fallen down on my knees as i face the raging sea but the anchor holds in spite of the soul blessing that bridge again [Music] oh and there has been amen [Music] amen [Music] that's where god sing it now hallelujah [Music] is [Music] raging seas [Music] is [Music] well i have fallen

that happened the way it did and why now all of a sudden it's working your guess is as good as anybody's amen outside of the fact that god is sovereign and he does what he wants when he wants how he wants and how dare we question it so just thank you lord amen i'm glad it's i am glad it's working though i'm glad it's uh the streaming's working now so let's turn over in our bibles to malachi malachi chapter 3 amen malachi chapter 3 is where we're going to begin reading from today just read a couple of verses of scripture before we let you be seated in malachi chapter 3 we'll read verses 5 and 6 amen malachi 3 5 and 6. amen praise the lord let's bow our heads before we read the word now precious jesus lord god truly it is uh it is a grand time as we always have lord being in your house and lord learning of you worshiping you feeling your presence lord so real so dear lord so powerful in our lives lord we feel that spirit pulsating through us now god may it help raise our faith to the level lord to receive whatever you have for us in this service today whatever we have need of lord because we're we're a needy people lord but we're depending on you we're trusting in you lord because you are absolute you are everything you're our portion lord you're our shield and butler you're our beginning and ending in alpha omega lord you are wills of rose of sharon lily of the valley bright morning star lord your god of the mountain your god in the valley and you hear lord again for this service lord to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask for thing so lord we commit ourselves to you in full obedience to your word once again trusting and praying lord that you would anoint these lips lord to speak what you have to be heard anoint every one of our ears lord that we receive god in our hearts lord not just in our intelligence not just in our ears not just something that that would tickle our conscience lord or satisfy our spirit but something that would drive down in the depths of our soul lord and change who we are and make us more like you god granted lord bless these people that have come bless those who may be streaming now lord and god that your holy spirit would have preeminence in us once again bless this word bless the reading of your word we commit it to you now and ask you lord to once again be with us in jesus christ's name amen malachi 3 will begin reading verse 5 malachi 3 5 and 6. he says and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers listen to this now i'll be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hirelings in his wages the widow the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the lord of hosts for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed you can be seated if you like amen the lord give me a thought that i wanted to bring to you today i still have something that i want to try to get into that's going to take a little while to go through uh probably several months but i just haven't had the liberty to do it just yet i thought maybe yesterday when i sit down but then the lord took it a different direction so just trust me a blessing to you today however the lord leads or whatever his will would be but i want to speak on the unchanging god today the unchanging god it's very striking of that everything that we deal with and everything that we know and every person we know including ourselves and every facet of this world that we live in everything changes now everything is cyclical we know that and all the law of god still stays in place uh such as the grass the trees the animals things like that they all do what they do every year and in cycle they do it and it happens every year just like the sun the sun comes up every morning and sets every evening just as the earth turns and the it gets light and it gets dark that's the law of god as god said let there be and has continued on to this time but all the things that we see that changes all around us uh the government changes and people change and thoughts get better or sometimes worse uh everything changes but the one thing that does not change the one thing that is the constant is god he is an unchanging god and it's hard because uh as humans and we and we we grow up we're conditioned to uh to to lies uh we're conditioned to broken promises and and deceit and things like that uh we get conditions that because it happens so much in our lives we get conditioned as we grow up in this world that people are going to let us down and that things are going to go wrong and it things sometimes might get as we consider them or we say bad uh we're conditioned to to change we're conditioned to things evolving all the time and changing and and being different now than they were i guess i was getting a little nostalgic and a little reminiscent in my self when i started thinking on those things i shared with you a moment ago and uh this week for some reason i started thinking of my best friends when i was growing up and how good of friends we were how much time we spent together and i mean memories and things at times that friends i'll never forget just special times you know but all those things change everything is different uh being at the the tabernacle being with brother green for all those years was such a special time for me i love so much and you know but then things change everything changes the only thing that doesn't change is god god stays the same god is the unchanging god he tells us here i am the lord i change not so even though we're conditioned as human beings as we grow up to expect change and to know that change is going to happen and to know that we're going to change uh there was a time i didn't wear glasses it was a time i had no gray hair uh there was a time that uh i didn't have certain aches and pains like i have now and things in in our bodies things change uh and as they do it as we grow and as things get different uh it doesn't necessarily change for the bad it just changes uh because time continues to go on but even as we're conditioned to all the change the one thing the anchor that we can rest our soul on is is the lord god because he does not change he's not a god that he can lie he's not a god that he can change he's not a god that he can disappoint he's not a god that he would uh uh break a promise he's not a god that of any of those things now we in ourselves can get it built up in our minds to a certain way that if it doesn't happen a certain way we think it's going to happen we get disappointed but that's not god that's us that is our own imaginations our own feelings our own thoughts or our own opinions or the ways that we desire for them to be but that might not be god's will and if god's not allowing it to go that way you can assume and believe it is not his will because we desire and want the will of god and god continues to unfold himself but he's never changed god unfolds himself to us god reveals himself to us god opens his word and god lets us sin and peer into the very soul of the of who he is but that doesn't change who he is amen a lot of people uh and i think there's kind of a it seems like a a wholesale assault even in the christian world on the old testament it's almost like that it may have been going on for years but i've just noticed it myself recently uh where it just seems like that that even people i've known and christians and even people in this message will try to present the old testament to you like it it it's not relevant anymore but if you if you have a revelation of who god is and the unchanging god and god reveals that word to you and you can see him in it you can recognize god was just as much in the old testament as he is in the new testament god was reflected in the old testament and showing the types and shadows there as what he did in the new testament he's the same god those things do not change even from the garden of eden what we've talked about before when god himself made the decision that he took the blood of an innocent one to allow adam and eve to come out in his presence again god never changed that now we don't go and and and kill lambs like that or for that purpose anymore but the the fact still remains that it took the blood of an innocent one to be able to save humans to bring man back with god again it took that shed blood god decided that in the garden of eden it's never changed and it won't change because he's god amen now he did away with the daily oblation he did away with that daily sacrifice because he sent his own son to sacrifice once for all and that finished it well that's but he's still the same god people say well you don't go sacrifice anymore absolutely we do amen we sacrifice all the time giving praise to god with the fruit of our lips that's the scripture of course we sacrifice but see it's not the same it's not the same context that they talked about or they did in the old testament no we don't take animals and and take them to a chopping block and sacrifice them in their blood and all that they did in the we don't do that but we offer spiritual sacrifices see it's the same god god just magnifying himself god unfolding himself not changing he didn't change he unfolds himself magnifies himself because he's an unchanging god unchanging or uh unchangeable is the word that we know it is in the bible brother branham talked about is immutable god is an immutable he has the characteristics that we know that identify god i'm the present i'm omniscient all-knowing all-powerful uh immutable the immutability of god is the unchanging part of god he is immutable he cannot change god cannot have a better thought today than he had yesterday god cannot have a higher thought now than what he had two thousand years ago god cannot discover or find a better way to do something today than when he did it six thousand years ago because if god did something someone with a certain condition and some at some time then he's got to do it the exact same way today or he's not god our god is immutable he is unchanging he cannot change immutable is unchangeable or unalterable it can't even be altered which is a change uh anything that you alter is a change if you altered it's different than it was when you started but he's unchanging unalterable amen everyone everything changes but god god cannot change let's go back in the scripture here matthew chapter 24. now you babysitting there so brother you and i know that that's nothing new to me i i know that i've known that as this and i didn't expect to necessarily give you anything new but maybe put into your remembrance something you may have forgotten the significance of this because i want to get to something at the end of this the the significance of it because you think well why is it so important to know that god's unchanging well let me ask you this question and i don't want to get ahead of myself so i'll just give you a teaser why did brother brown a major major so much on hebrews 13 8 that became the theme of his message hebrews 13 8. we'll read it in a minute jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever unchanging god why did that become such a theme to brother branham you know brother madam said that i looked it up in different variations he said that over 3100 times in recorded messages over 3100 and there may have been other variations how he said it but if you look it up same yesterday today forever 3 100 times he says it in recorded messages so when you think about something that was through that profit that was that significant it it bears a a second look it it bears us taking relevance to it serious relevance 3100 to where it even became a theme to his message it's got to be a reason why is the immutability of god so important well let's look matthew 24 not done laying that foundation yet but we'll get to it matthew 24 35 matthew 24 35 says heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away pass away as in you would think being done away with but the word the word or words pass away if you go and you research certain things in the scripture to the the concordance uh many times most of the time a single word has a definition but there are sometimes depending on how much you've studied the bible there are sometimes that there's two or even three words that if you click on it amount to the same thing in the greek not just one word two or three words together pass away is like that pass away together makes up the one word uh i i can't pronounce it but it's p a r e r c h o m a i i wish i could pronounce it i probably could have taken the time to learn it but that's the greek word to pass away the two-word phrase pass away is this greek word this greek word is the word that brother branham used in in a future home when brother branham talked about and future home where it says heavens and earth will pass away and you go to i believe it's uh james or maybe it's peter where he talks about it being changed from one form to another not literally an annihilation see if you go into that scripture and you see heavens and earth will pass away well pass away it's not talking about a complete annihilation it's this greek word here that starts with the p this greek word here which means as brother adam explains in future home it means changing from one form to another heaven and earth will change from one form to another but his word cannot pass away or what change from one form to another same word same word as pass away here is the same word over in uh peter where it says pass away it's the same greek word change from one form not annihilation it's not saying annihilation heaven and earth will it's not talking about being annihilated but it's talking about being changed heaven and earth shall uh shall change but my word shall not change pass away change from one form to another now why is it significance because god is the word amen god is the word the word is god the word is christ and if he can't change then how can his word change used to be and i've said this many times but he used to be and i was growing up and back uh probably even further back to the end your word was your bond now there are certain people you can still have that that agreement with a handshake a promise a word spoken was something you could you could anchor yourself on because that person was as good as their word if they told you they were going to do something they were going to do it amen unless some catastrophic unforeseen circumstances came about they were going to honor their word because well where do you think that comes from what comes from the root of this country being established in christianity and the root of this country being established in christianity it it uh it developed its values the values of this nation what it was founded on the values of it was founded on the scripture the bible there's many parts of our of our laws that are on the books today federally and statewide that are scriptural principles now there'll be a lot of people and atheists and whatever that'll try to get you and sways you from that get you away from that but the fact of the matter is thou shalt not lie is in the bible thou shalt not steal is in the bible well that's still a that's still a law that are on the books today as much as people are violating it it's still against the law to steal something that doesn't belong to you well that's rooted in the principles of the scripture that's what that's what maybe i shouldn't say this but that's kind of what gets me sometimes when uh when you see the the nation when we do certain things that we do with other countries uh we go and we we handshake with a russia or a china or an iran who would rather kill us than be shaking our hands and we we accept their promise that they're not going to or they're going to do something when you're dealing with non-christian non-moraled people that just would assume lie to you as they tell you the truth they don't care and we depend on the we we depend on their well he said he wouldn't do this what does that matter that in five bucks you get your cup of coffee at starbucks it means nothing not worth the paper it's written on and we depend on it all the time and i understand people say well you gotta you gotta depend on what they're saying but as the fundamental foundation of our country and and in respects to its leadership and its citizens we are responsible for our own the bible says that charity beginning at home how can you help someone else if you yourself are despondent if you are destitute if you are broke if you are morally bankrupt how are you ever going to help somebody else let me help you reach this moral superiority when you yourself are so immoral it's not even funny well that's what we do let's lift you up to these great heights first of all they don't want to be lifted up because they're happy who they are stealing plunging killing murdering is still bombing babies and women and children as much as they can over there ukraine right now we continue to remember obviously those believers those people in prayer amen russia and ukraine but they don't care you understand and and for them to say oh we'll do this this and this and and we and this country this leadership anchor our what we do on that when life to them is nothing lying doesn't mean anything those those people aren't rooted in what we're rooted in we look at it and think hey a man should be as good as his word well that's god god is only as good as his word because he is his word and in fact truth is we are our word what comes out of your mouth is a representation of who you are and if you speak that you are that because that's who we that's who that's what the representation of us is what we say what we say what we do that's who we are well god's the same ways he is his word well if his word can't change how can he change if he can't change how can his word change well his word can't change praise the lord thank god for that saints amen again because that brings us to the point of understanding amen that god is immutable that god does not change hebrews 13 8 let's look at this we know it yeah sometimes we misquote it a little bit but right hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever years ago i was when the internet thing was just starting and it was getting to be a big thing and they had these chat rooms you know every ever back then you ever did the chat room thing back not not anything close to what it like it is now uh just it was just a little room where people's names and a sentence would come up and people could type i was a horrible type it take me half hour just type jesus where's the j and then and i learned to type because of that but it takes forever i would try to answer a question and i'm sitting here trying to type and five and ten other people have already said stuff they've already moved on to a different subject i'm finally done well what's the point of that but one of the things that i have put in there this was a christian chat room these people were supposed to be christians and one of the things i was telling them in in reference to what they were speaking about was but jeep because of how things change and see that's what most churches want to teach you you know let's just roll with the changes just go with the changes let's update our churches let's update our music let's bring rock and roll in or jazz whatever it is we'll we'll update our music well okay to satisfy the older congregation like it's an oldophobia or something oh is that a word they got a phobia for everything so i guess there's the old phobia we'll just satisfy our patronize the old people and we'll have a contemporary or a traditional service for them so now a lot of churches they have uh two morning services a contemporary service where they play the rock music and probably ever hardly mention the name jesus and then they have a traditional service for the old people because you got to change we want to get all the young people in well you want to get a young you want to get young people in that are that are going to be christians and born again and ready for a rapture you need to preach in the word of god and teach them exactly how they're supposed to be not feed them rock and roll and tattooing tattoos are okay you know that's everything becomes okay but it doesn't my god doesn't care about that yes he does if he didn't it wouldn't be in his word and that's the problem people don't i dares to say most people have no idea what the scripture even says about god have mercy on the man the minister that would tell a young person that it's okay to scar your body like that because they're the ones that should know the scripture well they all should but getting it because that kid he's not going to look in the bible for himself he doesn't know he's depending on that spiritual leader to tell him on it's okay it's okay to do this it's okay to have this kind of lifestyle and live this kind of way and friend but that's just the way it is it's rolling with the changes we'll just keep up with the changes amen no we just need to obey what he's given us obey what he's got for us that's what we need to do not just not change everything to suit us but that's exactly what people do they change everything to suit us but jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now if he was the same then as he is today and i was telling this person that chat room i put in there because they were talking about the changes i said but the bible says hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said oh that that that doesn't uh count for today or something like that just he dispelled it somehow i don't remember exactly what it was a long time ago i don't remember what what they said to to throw it all for the spiritual i said that's the scripture that's the bible you either believe the bible which is the word of god which is god himself or you don't right it's your choice but even even then was nullifying the scripture jesus christ is saved yesterday today and forever well if he hated it yesterday he hates it today if he hates it today he's gonna hate it tomorrow if god loves something yesterday he loves it today and if he loves it today he's gonna love it tomorrow because it's god if god asks for one thing one day he's not gonna ask a different today it's the same today it's today it'll be the same tomorrow that brings me to my theme why is this so important why is it so significant that we get that real doubt deep in our soul revelation of what of the immutability of god that the that god does not change why did brother branham hammer it so hard especially now this may give you the clue you may already know it this may give you the clue especially during prayer line services where it had prayer line of people coming up and need healing he would emphasize jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever especially when he had prayer lines 3 100 over 3 100 times brother branham makes this statement in recorded in his recorded ministry 3100 why would he do that why would he make i mean outside of only believe why would he make the theme of his message hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever one reason to me now there could have been others but one significant reason to me because this being so poor this uh being this important brings us to the place of faith it's hard to have faith in something that's unstable if somebody's wishy-washy if they're here today gone tomorrow if they promise one thing here and over here and they renege here and they were nick here and they don't do it and they don't follow their word and they don't do it's hard to trust that person it's hard to have confidence and faith in somebody that doesn't uphold to their word the the the pinnacle standard that every one of us should have our word the value of our word well the value of god's word is the same but if if the person is not holding to the value of that word maybe they're a habitual liar a pathological liar maybe a lying comes so uh uh simply to some people it just comes out of their mouths before they even realize they're lying but it's true unfortunately there's a certain place the bible teaches us that liars go and i think we know what that place is but lies deception broken promises happens to us our whole lives it shouldn't but it does but the only place it doesn't happen is with our relationship with god in our relationship with jesus christ we can't it's hard to have confidence in somebody test tribe that fails well it's 50 50. oh 70 30. 10 90. i really can't trust this person and and honestly friends there's people i know they're on the 1090 scale i have about 10 confidence in that person that's pretty low amen i have more confidence that the lights are going to come on when i flip the switch out there then i do when that person tells me something amen when you've been deceived and you've been burnt and you've been stabbed in the back so many times it comes to the point to where you're your confidence your trust your faith in that person is gone but the contrast to that is god that's why even in the unseen we can have full confidence and assurance and 100 faith that he's going to do what he said he would do now again sometimes people say well god didn't do this well why didn't he was it against was it because it was against what you wanted because it didn't work out the way you expected or it wasn't according to your will you know so many times we pray a certain way and god answers our prayer and we miss it because he doesn't do it exactly the way we thought he would missed it all together because it wasn't done like this wasn't god that failed it was me that failed it was you that failed because god didn't fail god never failed god can't fail it is an absolute bonafide impossibility for god to fail can't happen can't lie god can't lie god can't renege on a promise god can't go back on his word god doesn't take back what he gives you that's why so many times i hear people preach about because brother branham said you know if you do this or that and the spirit of god will leave you and people think you've lost your salvation you mean to tell me that if i go a mile an hour of the speed limit i've lost my salvation until i drop back down to the speed limit is that what you're telling me i know that sounds frivolous things but that's kind of the way some people believe it because brother branham said that dove takes his flight right that's what he said right but without an understanding of the revelation god doesn't give you the holy ghost and you are born again and sealed with that promise god doesn't take it away from you the next day god doesn't take it away from you because you went through a peak light god doesn't take it away because you want a half mile to speed limit it's an anointing that anointing it might leave but you don't lose your salvation if you're saved if god's filled you with the spirit if you've been sealed you've been sealed to your destination amen god doesn't give it to you and then take it away from you oh here's the holy spirit you're born to give him change your soul burn out that old nature and then tomorrow he's like oh you've been a rotten kid i'm gonna take that back from you god doesn't do that amen amen god when he gives it he gives it that's it this decision is final amen that's exactly what it is but our faith look here now our faith is what it's based on is based on the immutability of god if god were not immutable if god were changing flipping here one day gone the next how would you ever have confidence in something like that but god's not like that so the the foundation of the importance of hebrews 13 8 of brethren mentioning it so many times especially during times of prayer lines where people's faith needed to be to a certain level to receive what they needed from god their faith had to get to that place over and over he's the same today did he do it yesterday then he'll do it today if he did it today he'll do it tomorrow because he's unchanging you can have faith in someone like that you can have confidence in someone just think about this for a minute if there was ever one human ever on the planet earth that ever was like that to you in the flesh would you have the utmost hundred percent confidence in that person yes i would i'd trust that person for anything i could tell them anything i could tell them the deepest darkest secrets and say keep it to yourself and know that that person wasn't going to tell somebody else if you don't tell somebody else right i could have confidence in that person i've never found anybody in my life like that including myself amen i've let people down all the time i try not to it's not my intention i don't say it with the purpose of of purposely deceiving somebody that's where you get into the depths of sin see you you say something for the specific person of deception that that that's the lie that the scripture's talking about if you say something of the whole heart assurance that you have every intention of fulfilling your word and some happens and you're not able to that's different but if you tell somebody and and you know in your heart you're purposely deceiving that person well that's satanic friend because you absolutely know that you're deceiving them and that that's against the scripture look at this the unchanging god brother branham said it wasn't so from the beginning that's the message therefore when god once does anything or makes a decision as i've often quoted that he he always has to stay with his decision just like in the garden of eden like i said his decision was it took the blood of an innocent one that's his decision he's got to stay with that decision all the way through amen and he did how that how that listen now this is tremendous as often i was going he said he always has to stay with his decision how that ought to enlighten our faith amen how that ought to enlighten our faith see when god says something all heavens and earth will change pass away but that cannot change or pass away therefore it should give us character it should give us faith amen is to give us faith to take that word which he has said and with all of our life hold on to it because he cannot change it with all of our heart with all of our being hold on to it that's why we can that's why this word is so important to us this scripture is so important to us see friends there have been holy books written by men you got different the koran mormon book there's all kinds of different books that are considered sacred to their religious sect and those people follow those books those things were written by fallible humans this book was written by god himself through the hands and intelligence of other people but god wrote it this is god in letter form now this isn't this isn't god it's a book but in letter form god has made a way to reveal himself to us so we can read it but the others are fallible because they're written their their author is is fallible well if the author is fallible then how is the word on from that author not fallible our word is infallible because it it came from an infallible god an unchanging god so you can trust it that's why this this bible this word is so important if people want to do away with it friend and preach some kind of modern day something no this word change it how many how many variations do they have now of the bible how many different interpretations and translations are there two or three thousand i don't even know anymore how many uh but there's only one revelation of this word that god gives to his children only one amen out of the thousands of translations there's only one revelation because it is god one so it doesn't god's going to reveal it regardless the problem people have is they want to try to understand the bible instead of letting god reveal it to them amen the bible isn't here for your understanding the bible is here for revelation to change your life to anchor your soul which will change your life that's what the bible is for that's what god gave us this word for so he could unfold himself just a little more and reveal himself to us so we can become new creatures not to gain a greater intellect not to have something to argue with another brother about how right you are and how wrong he is it was given to us so god could reveal himself and open himself to us amen so it's it's not a level of intellect i need to understand what this says not just pray god will reveal it to you amen amen absolutely because it's his word that's where we rest our faith i got another scripture i want to read hebrews chapter 6. hebrews chapter 6. now we've you ever heard the phrase which you became popular i think back in the 90s you see bumper stickers and stickers and and this thing all over the place i didn't think one time i remember at a billboard in charlotte north carolina somebody had a billboard god said it i believe it that settles it oh no god said it that settles it whether you believe it or not when god said it that settled it i don't have to believe it for him to settle it now i have to believe it for it to be settled to me right i have to believe it but when god said it that settled it that's the end of it amen it's his word praise whether i believe it or not but i do so then it's settled to me praise the lord it might not be settled to the person down the street but it's settled to me because i believe it right but it's settled either way if it's not settled then what is god going to use when he gets on the other side of the white throne judgment what is he going to use it's like billy graham said many times if god's going to judge the world how is he going to do it by the catholic church well if the catholic church which catholic church the roman church the orthodox church the greek church which one is he going to do it oh it'll be the baptist within which baptist southern baptist nor the baptist eastern baptist western baptist first baptist second baptist tenth baptist which one is it going to be methodists which methodist which presbyterian which lutheran which church which denomination or affiliation of is it going to be well it's going to be by the message what message the nine different interpretations brother adam told brother greene he would find when he come here which one of those nine oh brother branham is coming back oh brother madam is god well i'm not going to go into all of them which one is it going to be god's not going to judge the world by that absolutely not god's going to judge the world by this his holy word and this only that's how he's going to judge because he's a just god amen he's not going to judge you by catholic not going to judge you by method he's not going to judge about tucson tabernacle tabernacle word of god tabernacle he's judging it by the word amen that's why it's so important that you as you read that ask god for revelation that word to anchor your soul to it amen it's not significant that you can explain it but it is very important that you believe it absolutely imperative that you believe it you must believe it it's his word god said it that settled it and when it's settled that's what he uses that's his standard amen when we get on the other side when when the white throne judgment is set up the books are open that's the standard god's gonna judge it by he's got the word he is the word their lies the book of life and how is their lives gonna match up to that word that's how god's going to judge it thank god we'll be on the throne judging with him because we've been found guiltless praise the lord but that's how god's going to judge it's got to be by what he said his word doesn't change that's how he can judge justly because it doesn't change like he doesn't change hebrews 6 13. let me close here for when god made promise when god made a promise to abraham our father of faith because he could swear by no greater because there is no one greater he swore by himself god swore how about himself because there's no one greater to swear by he swore by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee that was god's promise god gave abraham that promise and so after he abraham had patiently endured he obtained that promise he obtained it praise the lord as the sands of the sea as the stars of the sky he obtained the promise god gave him that son isaac that was his son out of his own loins would issue forth his heir and from that air would be the sands of the sea the stars of the sky innumerability praise the lord he obtained that promise he patiently endured had faith he had faith go romans 4. he had faith the bible says hebrews 4 god's recording of abraham was he did not waver you go read the actual story in genesis 15 to 20 you find out that it sure looks like he wavered to me even took hagar into his bosom and had another child looks like he wavered but when god come to write in the new testament of god's account oh i love that god's account of abraham was he wavered not praise the lord amen that that's my talk about a god you can have faith and trust in talk about a god of justice praise the lord amen god's account of abraham was he wavered not so his faith he patiently faith he obtained it because god promised it and god is good as his word amen let's continue on now for men verily swear by the greater which of course there's always a greater than us that is god sweared by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of strife well that's like abraham said well god i know you promised me but i'm getting old is it that you can show me what is it that you can give me to to prove that this is going to happen and god gave him an oath he gave him a promise and then he gave him an oath amen he gave him a seal a seal that would help him understand because of this i have upheld my end i will do what i said so when people give you a promise well one thing is a promise it is sort of like a down payment to when i was a realtor we had what was called earnest month if you went to buy a house the people required earnest money a down payment well we need five thousand dollars as as sort of a guarantee that you're going to buy this house because we're going to keep this house from being sold to the rest of the world and it's going to be our promise to you is we're going to sell you the house and nobody else even if somebody now this is the way it's supposed to work it doesn't always happen this way because of greedy serpents but it's supposed to work where that house becomes unavailable to anybody else even if somebody came along and offered five million dollars more in money they cannot buy it because you promised that person you're selling it to them for 20 cents you can sell it to them for 10 million but you've already well it can't be 20 cent because you got 5 000 earnest money 10 000 how's that house for 10 000 so you got to have 5 000 earnest money you gotta have a down payment so work my my promises to you is and i hope you get the spiritual application here now my promise to you is i will not sell this house to anybody else no matter if somebody comes off me ten million dollars for it i won't sell it to them now that's the way it's supposed to work you know it was like illegal stuff that happens and anyway but my promises i won't sell to anybody else your promise to me is you're going to give me five thousand dollars as an oath as a down payment that you're gonna do what you're telling me you're gonna do see so that person's giving them the money he's saying okay now you're not going to sell it to anybody else nope not going to sell them to anybody else here's the five thousand dollars in i'll give it to you you hold it for us and we promise we're going to buy the house that's the promise of course you got inspections and all that mess but just say the house is perfect that down payment is an oath now the promise is there and it's recorded it's been written in paper signed by both parties but the oath is the down payment the down payment says this is what i'm giving you to show you that i'm good to my word now if that person backs out of the deal and decides not to buy it with no legal recourse then the person that was selling it to them could keep the five thousand dollars for doing nothing they keep the money because they reneged on the promise on the oath because they didn't follow through with their oath that they were going to buy the house now again the house is perfect nothing wrong with it so there's no good reason for them to back out i know somebody he's a millionaire so it doesn't really matter but he put 20 000 earnest money on a house and backed out of the purchase the person that he promised he was going to buy the house from kept the 20 000 legally he had the right to do that and he did because the person who backed out had no reason to back out the person who was selling in the house did everything they said they were going to do they kept the 20 000 see that's the oath that's the down payment that the promise has been made it's been written but there was an oath there amen that oath says that this is the down payment you know god gives us that oath too just like he did abraham god gave abraham that oath see that oath is for confirmation praise the lord god gave abraham that oath well he gives us an oath too because we stand and say we believe and if we really truly believe and god accepts our faith he seals us with his own spirit he gives us the earnest the down payment the holy spirit that says i promise that you belong to me and my promise to you is god that i will serve you and live for you my entire life amen there's a promise it's sealed it's done the confirmation the oh and now you live that life like the holy spirit that's living in you because that's the oath that he gave and the oath for confirmation is to them or is to us an end of all strife praise the lord saints you understand what that means there's no toiling over it there's no worrying about it there's no fretting over it there's no wondering or or or going back and forth no it ends all strife because god gave us the oath oh am i saved am i gonna go on the rapture are you born again do you have the holy ghost then there's not a devil out of hell can stop it from happening amen not even your unbelief at that point can stop god from taking you in a rapture because you have the down payment you have the earnest you have the oath the holy spirit that's what you can anchor your soul in saints that's what you have faith and trust that the god that promised it will deliver it it ends all strife there's no worry there's no fret over it oh i'm scared to death that that that my child is not going to be there if that if your faith holds on to this oath and the promise of god's word they're as good as there you know that jesus christ the bible teaches us jesus christ was crucified before the foundation of the world in the mind of god brother branham said jesus was just as good as crucified back then as he was when he actually hung there in physical form amen he was just as crucified before the world was ever laid because it was in the mind of god the oath the oath that god gave us ends all strife he promised it he gave us an oath praise the lord now we gotta now we got a relationship now we got a relationship that we can live with we can deal with wherein god willing let me finish this wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immune ability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath praise the lord jesus it's been confirmed been confirmed in me god said it i believe it confirmed by note that that by two immutable things his promise and his oath in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us this is this now which hope we have as an anchor of the soul oh well why is the anchor the sauce all stripe is gone my soul's anchored there's no more talking about it no more debating it there's no one worrying about it or fretting over it it's done it's finished it's settled it is it's a finished work it's just just as good now when it's happening as it was in his mind before the foundation of the world praise god he just gives us the promise and the oath by those two immutable things because god cannot lie by those two immutable things all the strife is gone we have a hope that we have anchored our soul in both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek praise the lord now our soul settled it's finished it's done he promised it he gave us an earnest an oath a down payment that's as good as done praise the lord now we can end all strife i'm not worried about it saints it doesn't matter whether god takes before i walk back out that door i have an oath i have a promise i have a spirit i know his word i know it's true i believe it the devil comes says but don't you remember what you did the other day oh yeah i remember it i have a memory in my spirit yeah i remember exactly what i did you're the one that calls it and i've repented of that now it's back on you satan now you're the one that has to live with it until the day of judgment and at the day of judgment you're going to be held guilty for it not me praise the lord i've been justified as if though i never did well then where'd it come from the devil that's exactly what we're going to do remind him he wants to try to remind you of past remind him of his future amen where he's headed but he'll do it he'll challenge he'll try to destroy every bit of faith you've got with it amen praise the lord jesus let me read this he swore by himself i'm close here you know i'm a i'm not a sign seeker and i'm reading that even though that would be something i would say too but i believe in science that's right if there is no invisible sign given to man today why no wonder people can't believe listen this real close now because it's exactly i think it probably was happening in 1954 when he preached this but boy howdy doesn't it happen today this is exactly no wonder people can't believe they go around and people just took all the supernatural out of the bible yes a man come up said i'm saved well you can't doubt him you can't say he's not that's right he says the man come up the street just as drunk as he can be cigar hanging out his mouth staggering hollering whooping cussing every breath he would say i'm saved because i believe he said what are you going to say about it what are you going to do about it there ain't nothing you can do about it he says my church takes me in i'm a member what are you going to do about it there's nothing you can do that's exactly right i'm a member of the so-and-so church they don't care if i've gotten drunk they don't care if i smoke they don't care if i drink they don't care if i crowds around they don't care if i gamble they don't care if i got tattoo head to heal i don't care i'm a member of the church i'm a believer i know what you're going to tell them no you're not a believer well you can say well the signs shall follow them that believe right signs follow them that don't believe him amen he said the signs he said that's exactly but the only way you can tell is by the sign what's the sign the sign is the oath what's the opioid that's the holy ghost the promise the earnest or the the earnest the down payment is that right that's exactly right you have to see the sign to show it now if it's just of faith alone then faith don't do it abraham believed god that's right it was imputed to him for righteousness but god gave him a sign praise the lord god give us a sign he gave abraham a sign he gives us a sign circumcised him as a sign a seal then abraham's seed receives circumcision praise the lord it's exactly what happens to the bride today every son of abraham is circumcised today you son of abraham or a daughter of abraham if you want to do the the gender thing you son of god today daughter of god today daughter of abraham son of abraham said every son of abraham is circumcised today not of the flesh and of the heart but of the heart the holy spirit circumcises the heart cuts away the things of the world and makes you a new creature in christ he confirmed it with an old stripes over friend amen it's over satan can rant and rave and rail and go on about whatever he wants to say and do but it's over stripes done it's finished god's already done it he's promised that he's as good as his word so it's finished i'm saved my family's saved those i believe that's gone on they're safe they're already there waiting on me saved praise the lord it stripes over i don't have to try to fret about that i know it god's done it he promised it so i will i'm working no the word is gone the stripes gone amen it's a finished word praise the lord now you have faith now you have faith faith promised he would do it god promised he would do it now faith holds him to that promise amen faith holds him to that promise don't let satan defeat you out of that faith hold that faith because that's what keeps us going in this world in this life and everything that we need from him we get it by faith believe it amen god does everything for a purpose or reason and we trust him all stripes gone because i trust him hebrews uh uh romans 8 28 is established on faith trust finished all things work together for my good how do i know that because i believe him because i trust him my trust comes from love my faith is operated by my love my love for him praise the lord let's stand if we could i'll stop there i'm glad god is the one that promised god is the one to give the oath god is the one that makes it i don't have to worry about it sometimes i've had people tell me stuff and i i and i just be honest it's how i wonder if they're actually going to do it i do i wonder if that i wonder i know they promised but are they are they really going to do it are they actually going to do it i'm sure you've probably had that too with people in your life they said well i'm i'm gonna be there i'm gonna do this or whatever and whether it's purpose deceitfulness or not it's you can sometimes you can have doubt whether that person's going to do what they said they were going to do or not but no doubt with god god promised it there are no circumstances if god promised you something there are no circumstances extenuating or otherwise that will stop him from doing it period i might get caught in traffic have a flat tire be distracted caught whatever it might be we all might have unforeseen circumstances that would keep us from fulfilling a promise that we gave but not god amen god would bankrupt heaven for one of his children amen not one thing praise the lord amen faith in god let's sing this course 3 16 we're saying it many times amen sanctuary lord prepare me to be a sanctuary praise the lord jesus summer 316 we probably know in my heart though amen god is as good as his word you believe him today faith trust amen he's still the same let's sing it to him now lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] [Applause] thanks [Music] yes lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy [Music] [Applause] thank you amen thank you jesus praise your name lord jesus amen oh friend really when you break it down people it seems are leaving christianity by the droves in one way shape or form but my i don't i can't imagine any other life that i would live in being a bible-believing holy ghost-filled christian it's just nothing like it amen no other type host muhammad's made all kind of promises buddha and confucius and whatever and all these great sayings that will lift you intellectually i'm not you know friend we come to meet death's door i could care less about my intellect amen you think i don't now but i do a little bit but it's the soul it's the soul i need to anchor my soul praise the lord amen god bless you i prayed something and said blessed you today now i want to mention a couple things to you remember i do want to have and i want to get a um an idea from you all because i had somebody mentioned this to me yesterday i mentioned trying to having wanting to to have communion and foot washing on easter it's brought to my attention that people have families and they go to dinners with those families which i understand which last time we had come we had our service went out had a bite to eat and then came back for communion and foot washing i wasn't planning to do that this time i was planning to have a short easter message if you will and i say sure y'all probably look at me and doubt that don't you sure yeah but i can tell you that's my intention uh and then and then after that have communion and footwash directly after so then you would have the day the afternoon whatever uh to go spend with family it it it that's okay everybody okay if not we can always we could always move it the weekend before the week and after it just came on my heart to do it on easter so uh i but i i didn't want that to interrupt anyone that had specific special things going on but if that would be okay we'll probably i try to see lord willing now i don't want to be in control of this so understand that i'll he i want him to be in control of it he's not in control of our services and the singing preaching everything i just soon stay home i just go to lunch now but i want him in control of it so understand that my intention is not to take any much more time than what we have like in today's service if he takes over uh that's that's not on us that's up to him whatever he decides to do but that's my intention so under those parameters is everybody still okay with having the communion foot watching on easter sunday yes okay good i haven't if not speak up is i mean we're all a family so if it's any issue let me know okay praise the lord the other thing is uh i want to have a brother's breakfast on april 2nd saturday morning april 2nd i i i haven't really figured where to have it again yet maybe i guess the denny's probably it's kind of convenient for brother dennis comes such a long ways and uh from the east so i prefer cracker barrel myself but [Music] they have better biscuits they have gravy they have fritz they have country ham i don't have any of that at denny's but i know brother dennis uh and and even uh danny have to drive a good distance that way so we just have it at denny's here so right now uh nine o'clock saturday morning at the denny's on april 2nd uh saturday april 2nd we'll have a brother's breakfast there for any of the brothers that would like to come uh it was just me dennis and danny last time uh please we'd love to have every one of you come so be a part of that have a little fellowship and a meal together so i did have that on my heart i've mentioned it before like the sisters have their lunches and stuff that maybe every two or three months we'll have something like that that we can get together so saturday's about the only day i can promise to be there with my week usually full so please remember that if you could as well pray for us and remember these prayer requests uh the things going on in the world today saints uh you know i hear so many times people talk about preaching on all the current events and the russian the ukraine and all the quotes and things and you know i would i guess i would too if the lord put that on my heart but he doesn't he hasn't any more than what i've already said so we know where we're living we know the day we know the season we're living uh i don't need to tell you what's going on you can see what's going on uh it's a travesty it's it's it's just it's horrible that these innocent people are being killed i actually had a little thought on my mind but the lord stood a different way you know the bible says the bible says if you see a brother in needs and you can help that brother and you shut up your bowels of compassion how dwelleth the love of god in you and i think about that and what we as a nation could do and a world could do to keep these women and babies from being slaughtered like that shot down just waiting to get some breads and i think anyway but god's in control he puts him up he sets him down so whatever purpose whatever reason we know we're at the end so amen we just cling to him that much more hold to that unchanging hand praise the lord amen it would have been a good song to sing god bless you love you appreciate you anyone have anything before dismiss today anything else in your heart amen praise the lord can you make it up here you want me to come back there somebody else want to be pretty cool i'm sorry did somebody else want to be thankful but priscilla mentioned it if you want to will somebody would somebody a believer come and lay their hand on his brother's knee anybody you can too that's fine amen come on moses put your hand on your dad's knee down there the one that's hurting him yeah get down there amen lord jesus father we're standing here as a group of believers claiming the promise of your word that by his by your stripes he is healed father and we're claiming that promise now for him and on his behalf and we're believing father in the name of jesus christ that you would take this pain from him lord and heal him completely god give him a new knee the doctors hospitals they could give him a new mechanical knee or something but lord you created this knee to begin with lord you are more than able to bring a new knee and put it in his body we believe now in the name of jesus that you would touch it heal him strengthen it now father and make him perfectly well in the name of jesus christ we pray amen yeah it's up to you can we do it when we're
