if you like thankful God is so good to us isn't he merciful loving and kind Tabitha wrote a praise report here I want to read to you says I asked for prayer for a little uh a little while back for a friend who had an uh Echo topic pregnancy that needed to be surgically removed and lost one of her tubes during the process they've been praying for another child for a while before this happened and she is now three months pregnant with a baby boy Amanda so praise the Lord anybody remember that prayer request about this baby this situation amen and Lord now blessed him with a babe another baby three months three months pregnant with a baby boy so praise the Lord amen wonderful God is good isn't he amen the answer 's prayer so thankful Micah had a couple of testimonies he wanted to bring to our teacher too um so if most of y'all are here some of you are not when I asked a special request that I did off camera due to the nature of the information but the uh the mother of the daughter of surrounding situation uh is regaining custody of her um and I can because I work next door so I see him past my window every day and you can see the change that they're both much happier so I want to thank the Lord to continue moving in that situation whatever the Lord would have done with with all of that and for some weird the other day I was making tea and I had a Boiling Pot of water and so I was going to put it in this little tea maker that strains the water out after it's brewed and I was pouring the water in and in my head I was like I'm gonna end up pouring this on my hand like this but I have no other way to do this over the scene so really careful and the water I ended up pouring some on my hand I got ready to jerk away but it didn't hurt I I have no idea how it didn't hurt how it didn't burn me because it was literally boiling rolling boiling water that was pouring into something and poured it onto my hand and there was no pain no burn no redness so I don't know what happened but I wanted it other than those velocity financially and with work and everything and I upgraded my phone after four years of having it I needed to upgrade and then I was like I just don't want to pay a whole lot of money and then Verizon had a special and I happened to catch it during that special so a little things that the Lord does good things amen praise the Lord amen amen he didn't say it but I don't guess he Minds be telling them but you know he hasn't been working how long you been at that place now eight months since March silence he said six months boss already gave him a raise a raise and 30 percent of part of the agency this trip is coming up amen and it asked me the Lord because she the the agency continues to be extremely profitable even though they hired me even though we paid for new computers upgrade our internet and we're still the Lord's just blessing us and she's happy to share that with people she's very generous so I want to thank the Lord and I I wasn't originally going to say this but it's on my heart again a I wasn't always good with paying my tithes and that's I've always had it in my head I can't afford to but a brother once said you can't afford not to so I told the Lord that if he continues to help me get back on my knees I will be diligent and I have and he's blessed terrible amen praise the Lord [Applause] amen monetary yes but not all momentary too water on your hand could have been a hospital doctor bill you know God Watches Over Us in every way doesn't he amen it's the only place in the scripture where God says prove me and see if I won't do what I said I'll do only place amen prove me try me that's the truth uh we had this uh request of prayer for uh this lady Grace in North Carolina that Dave Williamson had sent in I thought I'd give you the other update since we're doing the praise reports uh the one that was sent in now this isn't Dave this is what was sent to him so this afternoon she Grace was talking complaining about her hair being a mess and wanted to get up and walk around for a while uh I think that's for ADHD kicking in if there is one thing for sure Grace is going to come through this with all the great determination she's got she's a fighter more than likely she'll be moved out of the ICU in a few days in a regular room Whenever there is an available bed I will update uh room number and all this stuff but anyway that's the main update of her condition now a woman that just over a week ago was in a self-induced coma medically induced coma and not expected to live so God is mindful don't tell me he's not a miracle working God amen people say oh that's just medicine oh she got to the hospital oh she got to the doctor friend we know the great physician yes amen you can get people to doctors all day long and the doctor will look and say there's nothing more we can do how many times you hear Brother Brown's testimony doctors come and say people come to him and say there's nothing more the doctors can do but then Dr Jesus steps in amen praise the Lord that's when things change amen that's when things are made right praise the Lord it's good isn't it he's so good let's turn to song number uh 98 we'll see this one more before the service song number 98 and then our Lord's return we'll have it on the screen here too let's start with this let's start with the course

heart to move in your direction whether a neighbor or a stranger amen he takes care of us praise the Lord Jesus amen Last Stand to our feet if we could we're going to go over to the Book of Genesis again we're going to continue with the thought we had um past few weeks past month and a half or so the new beginning this will be part six I'm gonna get into the atonement today um thought we'd be able to try to finish it in one service but the more I studied on it and the more I went it was not going to be possible to do it in one service so uh we'll probably again sort of maybe like last week maybe a little short of service today based on that uh for them and then brother Noel's coming next week so it will be the following week after that the first Sunday in October that Lord Willem will try to finish this but just trust in the Lord's helping all of it so and your patience and love and prayers which makes the difference too amen Genesis chapter 1 verse one before we read let's bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Precious Jesus father it's a privilege to be here today thanking you so much again for your grace your love and mercy for the blessings you give us watching over protecting and keeping us Lord thank you for those that have come Lord those who may be streaming today thank you for the strength that you give Lord to be here the desire in our hearts Lord the health and Lord just to see another beautiful day Lord I pray that you would have complete control of this service now as we committed to you your Holy Spirit Lord would come once again with power and demonstration yes and do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think anoint these lips Lord anoint the hearers and whatever you have purposed in this service today that would be accomplished as we commit it to you thank you for it Lord we just know God that without you none of this would be possible but we committed to you with all the all the love in our hearts that we can give Lord because you are absolute you are all in all we love you we thank you he would praise you today we committed now to your hands the main part of the service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and void and darknesses upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you like it's good to see each other Angel amen missed you buddy your family of course love you all amen so welcome you're welcome you look familiar to me if I see if I met you would I would there have been an occasion that I would have met her maybe your sister's funeral or something I mean you look familiar to me you have you been here okay well welcome anyway so yeah I appreciate you being here today Leviticus now we're going to go over to Leviticus chapter 23 try to pick up where we left off last time Leviticus 23 we went in Fairly good detail the first few feasts here we're going to go through this uh this Feast of atonement this uh sixth feast because there's a there's a great more detail uh in this Feast of course than the typhoons from the Old Testament and from the Jewish tradition to the spiritual application the bride the Gentile bride um and and just showing the goodness of God Amen the grace of God amen you know if you're rely upon works there's no Grace but if you're expecting God's grace then works are then works are done away with amen even though we work we don't work to Salvation we work because we work in obedience to God's word we don't work towards our Salvation our salvation's already paid for amen that's by his grace so we don't work to salvation but we trust in God's goodness and God's mercy and God's grace and the blood of Jesus Christ so uh the Jews eventually come to that place the Jews come to the place that they rely upon that as well they recognize it and and that's what this atonement is all about there's a six-fold uh now if you've gone and you were able to if you forgot to understand but if you were able to listen to Gabriel's six-fold Vision to Daniel then uh a lot of this will be very familiar to you although there are some things I'm not going to say is outside of what brother Brannon preached but something the Lord revealed to me so um I just pray that it's the Lord's will and it's a blessing to you so we'll start back at the 23rd verse though Leviticus 23-23 um and we'll read through this Feast of atonement because remember the Feast of atonement comes in continuity or or together with the Feast of the trumpets it took the Feast of the trumpets to bring Israel back together again so that there could be an atonement because again I will reiterate God does not bless Israel outside their Homeland the only time God blesses His People Israel is in their Homeland the only time God deals with them is when they're in their Homeland so they had to have the seven trumpets to bring them back and remember these seven trumpets sounded what under our Sixth Seal which is the time that we're living now that's about to break loose in its fullness on this world uh through the tribulation uh these Seven Seals reconcile them back home again and they are home again remember we talked about uh their nationality and their flag and their currency and recognized by now what is called the United Nations as a nation so they that fig tree is in full bloom Saints we're not looking forward to bloom it is in full bloom so but that Feast of trumpets had to happen before there could be an atonement so God could deal with them so this 23rd verse now and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month again which is October uh their first month their seventh month is October the first day of the seventh month shall you have a sabbathy memorial blowing of trumpets and holy convocation you shall do no several work therein but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and the Lord speaking to Moses saying also on the tenth day of this seventh month now remember that atonement immediately follows those trumpets but there is a space of time amen there's the 10 days see a lot of times people forget about the seven days Nobles on the ark they forget about some things like these 10 days even though it was immediately following this now because that was to take place it was immediately falling but there is that space of time to where the trumpets blow Israel gets back in their Homeland before this atonement sets in and that's the lat that's the want to me that's the winding up of this last age and this Gentile Pride that's about to go home to the wedding supper that's this this is the winding up that last little bit of period that last 10 days is that last little bit of period that God's still dealing with the Gentiles getting ready to go back to the Jews already going back to the Jews we feel that anointing remember going that God's dealing but there is that period of time so that I believe and again I will tell you to me I believe we're in that period of time I do I believe that we are in that period of time between this between this fifth feast and this sixth Feast between the Feast of the trumpets and the Feast of the atonement the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be uh shall be a day of atonement it shall be in holy complication unto you and ye shall afflict your souls listen this very closely now he goes into some detail about this that is that is unrelated to the other Feasts ye shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord well what is this afflicting their souls it is a time of Sorrow is the time of Affliction it's it's a time of reflection and repentance is what it is amen it's a repentance that Israel falls into that place of repentance to God they're sorrowful for what they're doing amen or what they did so they afflict their souls make a an offering of fire unto the Lord ye shall do no work in that same day for it as a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God for whatsoever Soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever shall it be that doeth any work in that same day the same soul will I destroy from among his people you shall do no manner of work it shall be a a statute forever throughout your Generations in all your dwellings it shall be unto you a Sabbath abreast you shall afflict your souls in the ninth day now this was to start on the tenth day but remember the the noon day before starts that next day so the ninth day at uh the ninth day of the month of that seventh month at even from even unto even shall you celebrate that Sabbath or this day this Feast of atonement this afflicting of your souls this time of repentance now in reflecting on this time of atonement that we're going to start into and take the next couple of services on this reflection of atonement now I think we all kind of have an understanding of what uh an atonement is or to to to atone for something uh to to make amends or to make a uh to to make a wrong right amen that's what repentance is about that's what forgiveness is is for to try to make a wrong right to try to make amends somehow to atone for something that had been done uh erroneously before if something had been done done erroneously before and a person comes to an understanding that what they did was wrong they go to that person to ask to be atoned for so that their egregious actions would be forgiven them would be done away so that that would not be held against him anymore so this forgiveness is very important of course the repentance is the first the first part that's the most important thing the Forgiveness the Forgiveness brings about the atonement and that atonement is where God sets things straight with his people uh this is where God makes things right the the Jews is people and them they come together to make the things that have been done wrong correct and right to make amends for them amen so that they can be so that they can be atoned for so that they can recognize the atonement itself now the atonement was to be received should have under perfect condition would have been received by the Jews back when Christ came they would have recognized their Messiah they would have saw him as their messiah in the atonement that was made there from the very beginning the atonement was to be made and Jesus Christ come to be that atonement to be the one to take the place to right the wrong only Jesus Christ could have been the one to right the wrong he's the only one that could do it because every other man remember over in Revelation 5 there was no man worthy to take that book no man Jesus Christ the Lamb of God was the only one worthy of he was the only one worthy to take that book well what was in that book it was the names of the atoned those that will be those that were to have atonement done for them whose names were in that book I believe my name's there you Amen to be atoned for that atonement was to come from Christ was the only one worthy to take that float for atonement to atone for them praise the Lord so he was the only one that could do it no man could do it Moses couldn't do it John the Baptist couldn't do it all the great man that comes none of them could do it had to be Jesus Christ God's only begotten son that come on this Earth to make atonement and under perfect conditions the Jews would have recognized the Messiah that they had been looking for and praying for for thousands of years but their eyes were blinded we'll get to that part in a few minutes they could not recognize their Messiah they could not recognize this perfect atonement but that didn't do away with the atonement amen that didn't do away with atonement that just postponed the atonement for a different time that's why the trumpets had to bring them back together so that they could now eventually and were on the edge of it now received that atonement it meant to be atone to atone for their mistakes to atone for their wrongdoings now at this time God is dealing with them he has already taken the Gentile bride home in a Rapture of catching away however someone wants to bring the terminology catching away Rapture some people get funny about Rapture because they say oh it's not in the Bible Well it's the same word catchy if you say catching away it's the same phrase same word comes in the definition catching away God takes his Gentile Pride who he's been dealing with now for seven Church ages through that Feast of the wave loaf amen the Feast of Pentecost through that time God's been dealing with the Gentiles he's going to take her home to the wedding supper but at that for that three and a half years that tribulation sets in that last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel the last three and a half years that is to be uh that is to be the atonement for the Jews the Gentile bride God is done with and is moved into the into the Palace of God to a wedding supper now at the end of that wedding supper at the end of that time God then comes back and reveals himself to his people now look what brother Graham said about it in the first seal he said they didn't know now brother random he types this to to Joseph the story of Joseph we all know the story of Joseph and how God reveals him how God how Joseph revealed himself to his brother he put away the Gentile bride so that he could reveal himself to his brother because remember even then God only dealt with one at a time so he put the Gentile bride away done dealing with her at the moment to deal with his with his brother the the Jews so even then God only deals with one at a time even in the story of Joseph God was only dealing with one of them at a time right amen while the wife was in the palace he was dealing with his Brethren when he was away from his brother he was with his wife amen there and the revealing of himself to his brother was to be without the Gentile or removing or out beyond the camp as the Bible would say from the from Joseph revealing himself to his brother and that's where the story is picked up here he was uh talking to an interpreter Joseph was acting like he was an Egyptian sea and when it was made known he wanted to make himself known he kept looking at little Benjamin at 144 000 group that's my addition that's not in the quote that little 144 000 that God promised out of Revelation 7. remember he dismissed his wife she was in the palace when he made his self known to his brother now look friend this is very important because this is about to take place now I don't have a day I don't have a time I don't have a month I don't have a year that's God's timing whenever he desires I just believe that we're in this season right we're at that time right now amen looking for our loved ones to appear at any time amen ready for a Rapture she was in the palace when he made himself known to his Brethren only one at a time and the Gentile bride the wife after Jesus being rejected by his own people he had taken a gentile bride and will take her from here to a palace in a Rapture to his father's house in glory for the wedding supper that's what's ahead for the bride a wedding supper amen that's where we go looking for that time when God comes wipes all the tears out of their eyes sets everything wrong that's right amen make everything your strongest right in the wedding supper and then continuing on with a quote now and we'll slip back down amen from that supper slip back down to make himself known to his Brethren the hundred and forty four thousand that little Benjamin group amen reveal himself to the 144 000 win at the end of the marriage supper so as they go through the tribulation and Revelation 11 unfolds itself which I was going to read but uh forsaken time uh maybe next time we'll see uh through Revelation 11 where the two witnesses come Moses and Elijah and and all that unfolds with them recognizing what's going on and and see that that that I keep thinking momentum but that Spirit unfolding itself amen it's it's like God doing that quick work that quick powerful work for the Jews at that time unfolding itself um it began with that process and with that process came a recognition by the Jews that of what was going on they didn't realize it in its complete fullness until after Christ himself slipped down from the Gentiles and came and revealed himself to them personally amen people say the Jews will accept the message yes they will because Jesus Christ is the message and they will receive Christ he is their message amen and they'll look upon him and they'll realize what they had done and then they'll start mourn and they'll lament and they will and they will repent and and they'll they'll they'll work for that atonement in forgiveness for that atonement amen now look though let's go over to Daniel and see the things the that get into that six-fold purpose now of Gabriel's Vision to Daniel of the atonement that is to take place the only thing up to this time there's a few places in the scripture uh Exodus Leviticus especially where there's a reference to atonement but I want you to recognize something here that had came to my attention that I didn't recognize but that atonement there is different in the New Testament or how we know it today than it was in the Old Testament in the Old Testament atonement was put in a definition by men that come up with an understanding of what that definition would be and for the Old Testament before Jesus Christ came the perfect atonement that word atonement was simply covering or to cover up that's that's in the Old Testament that's what their atonement was because the blood we know that in the New Testament the Bloods of bullying goat bulls and goats could not make man clean it could not separate man from sin it could not wash away or annihilate sin all it did was cover it thus the atonement that they lived under in the Old Testament the old Torah was simply a covering for their sin it made it okay in God's eyes but it wasn't acceptable to God for for complete forgiveness there they had to receive the the perfect atonement Jesus Christ now we know atonement is something different to be atoned for as someone who took our place he atoned for us by taking our place in the Old Testament it didn't happen that way it was simply a covering and if you go look at the definitions you see atonement there just means covering but but in this atonement where it involves not bulls and goats it does not involve uh it involve animals and sacrifice of animals it involves the Jewish race receiving their Messiah unto themselves as that perfect atonement they receive him not not not an animal but Jesus Christ that brings not the Old Testament atonement of covering up but the new reality of the blood of Christ in that atonement annihilating sins not just covering it but divorcing you completely from sin so much so then in the Book of John it says that you that are born of God cannot commit sin praise the Lord because of the soul of man we know that we've gone over that cannot commit sin so much that atonement is so powerful friend it divorces you so much from darkness is from light it takes the it takes the red stain of sin and bleaches it white so that you can't even find it you can go back to the annals of the creation of that stain in your garment and it cannot be found by Satan or God or no one praise the Lord because his blood annihilates it that atonement does away with it not just cover praise the Lord the perfect atonement so I wanted to lay that as an understanding as we go through now Daniel chapter 9. Daniel chapter 9 verse 24. it's all just in this one verse Daniel 9 24. 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City for what purpose what's the point and remember the first three and a half of this is done through Jesus Christ Ministry and if we read the other portion of the scripture we see that in the midst of that atonement in the midst of that 70 weeks is cut off so we have three and a half left and you go back to Revelation 11 again we talked about the three and a half years you go back to several places Revelation 12 Revelation 11 where it talks about uh that 1203 score days has three and a half years I believe if I didn't get that number wrong it's exactly three and a half years by the Julian calendar of 30 days in a month 360 days in a year that's exactly three and a half years it's the remaining part of that three and a half years but notice that first half was under Jesus Christ's Ministry well Jesus Christ Ministry and Jesus Christ's life and giving his life was to be that perfect atonement that they were supposed to receive but he got caught off in the midst because they crucified him they didn't accept him they crucified him which we'll get to amen that cut it off in the mid so there's that three and a half that's still left well there's 70 weeks for the purpose of and let's read them [Music] to finish the transgression make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteousness and to fill up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now I want to get to as many of these as I can today but it's very unlikely that I kind of already pretty much set my mind we'll just do the first three if the Lord willing and time allows uh we'll just try to get through the first three uh the last two are probably the longest actually to get into but the first two are probably the most prominent ones so out of the issue cd6 these six finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliation for iniquity bring an everlasting righteousness cell division and prophecy anoint the most holy amen that's that six volt six-fold purpose Vision that Gabriel brings to Daniel here we just read That's six-fold now first one is to finish the transgression what was that transgression the transgression was Israel's blindness they did not recognize their Messiah their blindness well and God was to come to open their eyes to finish this blindness the the finish the transgression now we know uh a transgression is something that you do that you shouldn't do is to transgress a law or or a statute of something uh if you go and see the speed limit on the road is 45 and you go 50 you've transgressed that law you you 've come against that law to the point of being punished that's what the trend what a transgression is but God came through this to finish that transgression or that transgression no longer exists even in the mind of God to finish that transgression so let's go to it Romans chapter 11. Romans chapter 11 the blindness that Israel had was the transgression they would not have tried I don't believe now they would not have transgressed had they not been blind God allowed I take this stance and it may be a little different from some others but I kind of watched my verbiage here God allowed God sends a spirit of something let's just start there God if God sends the spirit or allows a spirit of something to come about let's just say even in our life if a spirit of something come now you are a free world agent you can receive that Spirit you can act upon it and you can do whatever that Spirit motivates you to do or not you don't have to do what this spirit is come on you to cause you or wants you to do you can reject that spirit God allowed his people Israel he allowed them to be blinded but to me how are they blinded they were blinded because and I have scriptural I can show scripture that that substantiates my belief here now but that God allowed them to be blind I know it says a spirit he sent them the Spirit of Slumber their eyes would not see and that thing but that that Spirit of that moved on them they allowed in their lives because their eyes were focused on something else they weren't expecting their Messiah to be born on the hepal of a cow's dung they weren't expecting their King and their Messiah to be born in a manger in a stable like an animal in a barn they weren't expecting that so when he comes forth they didn't even see him they couldn't even when he started to do the Miracles even when he was preaching now there are some of course that received it they were predestined to receive it and or they they shut that that that spirit amen because that Spirit came on all of them but it did not affect all of them did it that Spirit didn't affect all of them it didn't affect his disciples it didn't affect Paul and didn't affect a lot of the ones that came through at that time most of them it did most of the leaders most of the ones that were in charge most of the piety and the hierarchy it affected them they allowed that spirit because they had the Torah now this is a danger point now I'll tell you then people get into this today with this message they get it so figured out that when God does it a different way they miss it entirely yeah they don't see it they're blinded to it yes you see where I'm going they're blinded to it because they're so fixed on it's got to be like this God is gonna do what brother Bradham said yeah well there's nothing wrong with what he said there's nothing wrong with this scripture but there is a whole lot wrong with a lot of our understandings of it amen you can't have it so fixed in your mind that when God really does move or God really does fulfill a scripture God really does do it his way we miss it we got to be pliable and have our eyes open and expect it whatever God wants to do for it he can do it however he wants to do it he can do it if he brings a meal along to do it he can do it yeah yeah amen If he if he wants to speak through a mule to get his point across he'll do it right right he's done it before right yeah amen he could cause a wart to fall off your head and speak to you yeah amen anything God wants to do you can take your shoes off tonight your socks and your big toe talk to you tell you something now people might want to put you in the 13th floor of the hospital but God can do anything he wants to do that's why I know it's kind of sublime there but God my point is God can do anything he wants to do amen anytime he wants to do it let him do it don't get it so fixed in your mind don't get it so the words gotta be this where it's no way at all and then you miss it yeah yeah I believe that's what they were facing at that when God said that they were so fixed that when he came they missed him all together and when he done the Miracles it made him matter when he gave him ministering it made him matter when he told him I'm a man sin for God it made him so mad they put him on a cross even when he was producing the things the scripture said the Messiah would produce they hated him that much more for doing it right right you see how that Spirit could how that spirit is today amen against anybody that wants to try to do something good it seems like there's a spirit of hatred I want to call your name or put you in some kind of category of a you're just a horrible person because you do things that are so good that's just the mentality well that's the way they were with you they treated him that way and that's how they acted toward him and they and they missed him all together they missed it now with that background let's read this Hebrew Romans chapter 11. uh this oh my God there's so much in this chapter let's just go to the 25th verse it talks about the Wild Olive Tree and the team Olive Tree and and the the Wild Olive Tree Heaven branches of the tamola tree having branches broken off of it and then the wild olive tree branches were were tied into it to that root and that's a wild olives and Gentiles the tame olives and Jews and and God grafting in those Gentiles into that same Tree by that same root and that same root is Jesus to live off that same life 25th verse though see for I would not brother that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness impart amen blindness and that that that blindness is obviously something that's a covering it's a shield amen uh you have different blindnesses today you have a blindness of someone who has no eyes you have a blindness of someone that has eyes but can't see you have a blindness of someone that has eyes and can see a little bit but are considered legally blind but you also have a blindness of covering if somebody puts a covering over your head you can't see you're blind you're not blind in the sense you have no eyeballs you're blind in the sense that you can't see what's in front of you because of the shield and that's the definition of this blindness they're covered there's a shield there's a covering to where they can't see not that they're not capable of seeing but there's something there that's causing them or keeping them from being able to see it that's that Spirit of Slumber through their imaginations of how God was going to the Messiah was going to come that covering that blindness again now in part now that means just temporary that means that blindness of that covering is there to accomplish something for a short period of time and it did it made the Jews not recognize their Messiah and crucify him and cut him off in the middle of the 70 weeks so the Gentile bride could be brought in and that's what we've been dealing with for seven Church ages and then from the day of Pentecost through that Feast of the wave loath that Feast of Pentecost to today God's been dealing with the Gentiles it's getting ready to fall back over amen so it's in part the blindness in part it's happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in and when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in what happens to her she goes in the rapture she goes home amen 26 verse and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins take away their sins now the finishing of that transgression brings us to what the taking away of their sins what is sin unbelief what did they not believe they didn't believe Jesus they were slumbered from it they were blinded from it they were their eyes were covered they couldn't see but Jesus came God this is my Covenant that I shall take away their sin the end of the transgression finishing of the transgression or the blindness two the taking away of their sin now what's the second thing the number two thing on the on the atonement the six-fold purpose Dan uh to Daniel to make an end of sin praise the Lord Amen to make an end of sin now what is sin remember sin is unbelief making an end of the fact that they did not believe Jesus Christ was their Messiah make an end of that sinner what did he say here he's going to take away their sin make an end of their sin that was the number two on the six-fold purpose so that they could recognize what they did what was their sin what was such a great sin that Israel did that brought about this in their in their lives and remember God deals with Jews as a group amen he deals with the Gentiles as individuals he deals with the Jews as a group what did they do that was so horrible that put them under this curse for 2 000 years rev of Matthew chapter 27. Matthew chapter 27 To verse 24. let's start with the 22nd verse Matthew 27 22. this great sin of unbelief pilate saith unto them what shall I do then with Christ with Jesus which is called Christ they all say unto him let him be crucified now that's a great sin their unbelief LED them to killing in the most horrible way their very Messiah that they've been praying for for thousands of years it caused them to to actually sin unbelief to the point that they cried out to to pilate who was trying to let the man go his wife even told him said don't you dare have anything to do with this righteous man right she told him amen and like a man they don't listen to their wives I don't know why we're just done that way she wouldn't he wouldn't listen to his wife and he got involved anyway but she told him don't you dare have nothing and he washed his hands and then and we know scripturally there's no way the Bloods of Christ will ever be all part of the team yeah amen Through Time Eternity that blood will always be on his hands and his wife told him don't do it he did it anyway so he comes out and gets involved said what what do you want me to do with this man they uh this is the time that I can release any prison unto you let me just give you this man I tested my pride him he's a good man he's a righteous man he's done nothing wrong what do you want me to do with him let him be crucified didn't matter they were judged during an executioner all they wanted was to get rid of him amen great sin Saints let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil has he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified they didn't care if you've done evil or not they couldn't care they couldn't care if they could prove it or not sounds a lot like a judicial system today doesn't it yeah when they hate your friend they come at you with all blazes dog uh gun barrels blazing they're going to take you out if they have any chance at all and they don't care if you're guilty or not they hate you and if they hate you they want you crucified let him be crucified when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but rather a Tolman or an uproar now this caused an uproar uh burning down cities and stuff causing uproar was made he took water washed his hand before the multitude saying I'm innocent I know you're not of the blood of this just person see you to it then answered not just let him be crucified but he said they said let his blood be on us and on our children on our posterity on the ones in our loins that have yet to be born let his blood be on us and it's been there ever since amen that sin has been on them for over 2 000 years now and it's still there today it's about to be trans it's about to be forgiven uh it's about to be atoned for when they recognize it and they asked repentance oh just love the grace of God oh my friend or would any of us be today but for the grace of God God sending Grace it's also in Romans 2. I we read Romans 11 you go back and see that God extends to a people that lived by the operation of Works to Salvation he sent them Grace when there's no Grace in words and their whole lives their whole attitudes everything they did was about Works to the works of salvation and yet God still extends them their his grace think about Cain God himself told Cain if you'll do well I will accept you the very serpent seat of the Devil Himself right The Serpent and God said I'll accept you my friend is the grace of God is so powerful but they said let his blood be on us and thousands of years but there's about to come an atonement there's about to come a Reconciliation there's about to come or the the end of that sin is made now what is what brings about Sin sin I believe brings about uh an iniquity which is doing something you know you should not do or not doing something you know you should do I shouldn't Equity goes both ways if you look in the Bible the definition tells its lawlessness well what is lawlessness lawlessness uh effectively in its simplest form is doing something you shouldn't do but it's also not doing something you know you should do that's iniquity lawlessness so that iniquity so what is the third thing you can look back in it if you want to I just read it to you if you kept your place in Daniel there but the third one which is probably the last one we'll be able to get to today the third one is to make reconciliation for iniquity make reconciliation for iniquity to reconcile now another thing here to realize in the Old Testament versus the new verses before Christ after Christ Our common uh normal English language to reconcile is to bring two back together again Amen in its simplest form if two people are broken up they become reconciled they come back together again impossible I know the I know it says that in the Old Testament it says it but the definition of reconcile in the Old Testament is not to bring the two together again it simply it simply reverts back to the word atonement to make atonement for which is just covering or to cover but the true definition and sense of reconciliation or to be reconciled in our understanding scripturally by Christ today is that Christ and man have come one again that's what it means to be reconciled the two have become one there were one in the Garden of Eden sin by sin man fell there was a Breaking of God and man there was a great Chasm thrown between God and man but Jesus Christ bridged that Chasm with his own blood so that God and man could come back and fellowship again reconciled so when it's so reconciliation of the Jews they're high it can't be by their old law there had the reconciliation can only be by the Messiah that they crucified that we just read about that's the only way that them and God is his people can come back again as one like they were in the Garden of Eden even better if you will even better in the Garden of Eden man was uh was created amen he was just a flesh man now God and man had become one so much he's put his life in us the old God's Own Zoe literal life of God now lives in you and I right those that are born again that is even greater than when it was with Adam and Eve reconciled and he's doing that with his people to bring a Reconciliation for what they should not have done in the beginning they recognize their Messiah they recognize what they did they recognize uh that they crucified their very Messiah let's go over to Zechariah I'll finish it with this Zechariah Chapter 12. could be Zechariah Chapter 12 now we'll start with verse 9. and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Israel we know all nations will come up against Israel uh at that time during the tribulation God said you'll come against them and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications again a people that lived to their salvation by words God's going to pour His grace on them amen and of Supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced look upon him what He Slipped Away now he has slipped away at the end of the marriage supper got to the end of the three and a half years of tribulation He Slipped Away and he's gone down to his people again and they look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn I know that bitterness but that bitterness is what they're going to receive when they recognize who he is no more blind no more covering that period of impart that time frame that the impart they were to be blind is gone it's removed it's over they've reached the place of atonement the day of atonement this Feast of atonement that is going to reconcile for their iniquity bring them back one and they recognize him and they will remember and they and they're sorrowful and they repent amen God loves your repentive heart Saints they repent and they recognize who he is and in that day there shall be a great morning in Jerusalem as the morning of uh hadadrium in The Valleys of megidon and that uh and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the House of David apart and their wives apart without the family of the House of Nathan apart and their wives apart family and half the Levi apart their wives apart Family of shimiah his part and their wives apart the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart but look at the 13th chapter first verse in that day praise God there will be a fountain open in the House of David to the Jewish people in the House of David there will be a fountain on who is this Fountain anybody want to guess who this Fountain is the praise the Lord his name is Jesus he's the one his name is Jesus he's the only one Jesus that Fountain will be open in the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness they because they recognized him then he will cleanse and make clean anybody who recognizes and repents and comes to him anybody if you believe it now if you don't believe it you're just an unbeliever an unbelieved to sin you're just a sinner but if you believe in an accept it which they're doing they repented and they put on sackcloth and Ashes and they repent and they recognize who he was and they and they come before him and that and God opens up this fountain this Fountain called Jesus who is full of love and grace accepts them and forgives them and ends the uh uh the the transgression the end of sin and the and reconcile them for that iniquity it was the iniquity that drove them apart it was iniquity that drove them apart because they did something they shouldn't have done but God is making reconciliation to bring them together let's drop down in the 13th chapter I'll close with this I will got a couple more scriptures in that Zechariah 13 beginning with the sixth verse and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thy hands then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends he was sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel amen that's what he said he was called that Gentile serial woman a dog because she was there wanting Healy for her daughter you think oh how unjust no no no unjust is man's justice system Justice real true is God's justice amen and he called her a dog because she saw healing for her daughter but she was so desperate she finally got it and he said be it unto you amen be it unto you according to your your desires and she went home and found her daughter well but he was sent to the house of Israel his friends and those are the ones that pierced him we just read it let him be crucified and let his blood be on us and our children awake old sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow Seth the Lord of hosts might this Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand upon the little ones and that's exactly what they did they scattered the sword was laid upon them in judgment and they scattered all throughout the world that they could go at the time they scattered all throughout the world that's why God had to bring them back together but when they did that God said I'll turn my hand unto those little ones it's 144 000 the little Benjamin group Revelation 7 again and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the Lord two parts therein shall be cut off and died but the third shall be left therein and I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold as tribe and they shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say it is my people and they shall say the Lord is my God amen so the Jews go through the tribulation amen they go through that period of time they said it says they will be refined as silver is refined they will be tried as bold as tried why because they rejected him you say well the the Gentile go the bride go through no no no the church goes through that but not the bride she's received his atonement she's accepted him she's been filled with his Spirit she's been married to him now she belongs to him and he takes her home not he's not going to beat her up and then take her home the broad doesn't arrive at the marriage supper with a broke leg and a black eye amen amen and so I told you the other day about this the persecution squeezing stuff and people believe well they want to believe that's okay I got my own beliefs but I don't believe and I can show you in the scripture and a quote that God is not going to marry her and then beat her up so that she can go to a supper just go to the supper in a wheelchair or on crutches or with a black eye broke legs amen she is his beloved he takes her home and then all this down here Breaks Loose it's a tribute all the foolish virgin the Jews they all go because why they did not receive to the point of receiving the Holy Spirit the atonement to themselves before that time amen now there'll be some that will like the Jews during that time absolutely they'll see him they'll receive him just like the rep the witnesses of Revelation 11 they are killed lay in the streets and after a few days they rise up and they're resurrected they're raptured last Rapture of the Bible that happens to them but the bride she goes home in a Rapture before that takes place before all but chaos the real chaos and tribulation there's judgment going on friend we talked about that Sixth Seal is Unleashed it's going on now it's not broken it's totality yet but it will be but it can't be until God takes his wife home if God's gonna beat his wife up a bit why doesn't he just let her go through the tribulation then it doesn't happen that way right that's God's God loves your Saints amen he married you for a reason he's found you to be virtuous holy righteous without spot wrinkle or blemish because you've put on his righteousness amen we don't go through that time amen foolish virgin and all Jews they do because they they're the ones that have to be refined the bride is already refined she's already been found not guilty she's already been found in Perfection What Refinery does the bride need to go through when she's without spot wrinkle or blemish it's like a woman taking out a a dress shirt out of the closet that is absolutely perfectly pressed and try to iron the thing well what are you ironing for there's no wrinkles what's the point of ironing it if you want it to be warmer just stick it in the microwave or something put a oven I wouldn't leave it in there long but if you want it to be warm why would you iron something that has no wrinkles why do you refine something that's perfect the bride becomes perfect because she is him he is her amen the Jews do because they're not they're rejected him but they come out on the other side refined as gold hey man praise the Lord aren't you thankful man let's stand if we could it's just amazes me the more I look and how the grace and mercy of God is so prevalent in our lives uh things that people normally would would probably want to do away with you just like they did here but become one because of his grace because of his life because of the blood is perpetuating made us one reconciled back to him again he does it not just us but to him but to them the Jews his own people they're only blind for a certain period of time at times almost over he's about time to go back to them again amen let's sing this course 239 in the book you became me we probably know it and look it up he became me it's Psalm number 239 I don't have it on the screen here song number 239 he became thee that I might become him by his grace amen by his grace praise the Lord [Music] so that I might become [Music] here oh my grace he took my place so that I foreign [Music] so that I might become him [Music] he took my place [Music] by his grace amen amen thank you G thank you Lord thank you Lord aren't you glad the way the word of the Lord just comes together so beautifully Saints God reveals it shows us in there amen who we are all you belong who we belong to amen Just Surrender to him everything we are everything we've got amen he takes care of the rest he makes all things work together for our good because we love him amen [Music] last week I said that Rosh Hashanah the first of the New Year the fall feast I said it was uh last week I was misinformed it's actually the 25th of September and the day of atoma is October 4th begins October 4th in the evening um and I I mentioned this because it's just such a blessing to see the pastor is moving into this the spirit of God is moving him and and standing these times and the type and I just take him he didn't know this and um this was the season and um and I I'm blessed by it because God always moves on the Jews during these times of the festival so it's like as they put it in open heaven and we can take advantage of that amen praise the Lord God is perfect amen he knows what he's doing he knows when to do it how to do it it's all in his hands so thank God for that again I appreciate your prayers I'll be stepping away here and after we close and change my clothes for the flight so I
