[16:40] forever amen glory to the Lord Jesus
[16:44] couple prayer requests to mention to you
[16:46] before we go to the Lord in prayer uh as
[16:48] we all know remember brother Dennis is
[16:50] out of town him and his wife sister Leah
[16:51] they went out to uh uh his her stepdad's
[16:56] memorial service in Georgia uh they were
[16:58] driving also down to Florida to meet
[17:01] with uh uh someone that Leah wanted to
[17:04] try to help minister to uh having some
[17:07] difficulties so please remember them in
[17:08] prayer they're supposed to be back uh
[17:10] Tuesday or Wednesday I forget now uh so
[17:13] please remember them in prayer if you
[17:14] would the Lord just continue to bless
[17:16] their trip and bring them back safe
[17:18] grant them traveling mercies also as
[17:21] most of you probably know sister liia
[17:22] has been in the hospital uh she's had
[17:25] some stomach issues she's supposed to
[17:26] have an MRI today uh and uh just look
[17:30] and see what the the doctors find and
[17:33] she does thank everyone for your prayers
[17:35] so amen thank you for your prayers for
[17:37] sister Lydia but we don't want to stop
[17:39] just continue to remember her in your
[17:41] prayers today if you would also got a
[17:44] text from sister sheilia uh she could
[17:47] probably tell you better than I could
[17:48] read the text but she says no she's
[17:51] having a sword that's appeared on the
[17:54] the right of her right eye uh and a
[17:57] growing sword with the cancer treatment
[18:00] all that thing that she had gone through
[18:02] uh it was kind of expected but it's sort
[18:04] of at the wind the end of the two-month
[18:06] window uh these things kind of popping
[18:09] up so she just asked that we would
[18:11] continue to pray for her and for that
[18:12] situation and that sore by her eye today
[18:15] so remember that in prayer for sister
[18:17] sheilia uh also sister Julie put in a
[18:20] prayer request for her sister Kristen uh
[18:23] Kristen is very faithful to her tithing
[18:26] to this church although she's never set
[18:27] foot that door uh uh believe that the
[18:31] Lord's hand is on her however the Lord
[18:33] just bless her uh but she's uh leaving
[18:36] today to go to Phoenix to a conference
[18:38] and sister Julie asked that we pray that
[18:40] the god that God would Grant her
[18:41] traveling mercies keeping her angels He
[18:43] camped about her wherever she goes uh
[18:46] may it be a good blessed prosperous trip
[18:48] for her thank you God bless you amen for
[18:51] sister Julie also uh got a text just a
[18:54] little bit ago from Danny he's on his
[18:56] way into church he got about to print
[18:58] and Fort L and his break started going
[19:00] out on his car uh so please remember
[19:02] brother Danny said we'd be praying for
[19:04] him he didn't say whether he was going
[19:06] to continue to try to come on or go back
[19:08] home but I think he was closer to home
[19:10] than he was here so he probably went
[19:12] back home and the fact that he's not
[19:13] here probably uh would lend Credence to
[19:17] that so I'm guessing brother Danny went
[19:19] back home if you're watching brother
[19:20] we're praying for you know he's had
[19:22] difficulty here and there with his car
[19:24] uh but we just remember that brother Dan
[19:26] the Lord would just touch him and
[19:28] and uh and help him in his situation I
[19:31] this see each one of you amen welcome to
[19:33] the house of the Lord greet you in the
[19:34] name of the Lord Jesus he's so good is
[19:37] he amen uh pray for me I always forget
[19:40] to do this so I'm kind of trying to get
[19:42] in the habit of doing it I'm traveling
[19:44] driving to Las Cruses today for work
[19:46] this week so appreciate your prayers
[19:48] there I went and saw the
[19:51] U the physical therapist Tuesday um she
[19:54] didn't do much but evaluate me and give
[19:56] me a few things for uh a little bit of
[19:59] exercise stretches if you will to try to
[20:01] help uh my quadded started atrophying uh
[20:05] my glutes weren't really uh kicking in
[20:08] like they were supposed to to try to
[20:09] help support all that so the thing she
[20:12] gave me was to try to help support that
[20:15] and then I'm supposed to go back twice a
[20:16] week for the next three or four weeks um
[20:19] on my week home uh to get that better to
[20:23] strengthen it more to do more exercise
[20:25] but I will tell you I I bought the
[20:27] impared sister matis uh two months ago
[20:31] I've been month and a half I forgot dear
[20:34] remind me it's been a couple months ago
[20:36] so I've been faithful to try to use that
[20:38] even when I'm out of town I take it with
[20:39] me uh I don't know if it works or not
[20:43] but uh I have been using it Faithfully
[20:46] I've read online a couple places that it
[20:48] is supposed to help but it takes 10 to
[20:49] 12 weeks to see any results uh so uh
[20:53] after I saw the physical therapist and
[20:55] my faithfulness to the inform red
[20:58] treatment I've been doing my knee feels
[21:00] a lot better actually it's doing much
[21:03] better so I'm very happy about that uh
[21:06] usually uh I take my my bag and my tool
[21:09] bag usually they about 50 pounds a piece
[21:12] which is about the airport uh Airline
[21:14] limit uh of course I have some I could
[21:17] do up to 70 pounds but anyway they're
[21:19] both right at 50 and when I take them
[21:21] down the stairs with that added weight
[21:23] it usually puts a real strain in my knee
[21:25] hurts and it didn't do it last night uh
[21:28] I felt a little twinged but nothing like
[21:30] it had been in the past so thank you for
[21:33] your prayers because that's the number
[21:34] one thing um but uh the Lord has really
[21:37] touched it I feel much better so I'm
[21:40] thankful for that probably more of a
[21:42] testimony I guess than a prayer request
[21:44] but uh I appreciate that amen Miss
[21:47] sister Pat this morning not being here

[42:26] but it's the quality yes amen and I tell
[42:29] you what I love this book I uh I I don't
[42:33] mind telling you i' I've been serving

[42:42] he's sweeter today than he's ever been
[42:44] before the Lord amen I love him more

[43:46] we just appreciate the Lord and I'll
[43:48] stop rambling and let's turn in our
[43:50] scripture if you would uh just a couple
[43:52] of single verses in the Book of Psalms
[43:55] amen and maybe the Lord just bless his
[43:57] word and uh give us something that uh
[44:01] will encourage us and and help us in our
[44:03] journey and in our and our battle
[44:05] against Satan and our walk with the Lord
[44:07] I uh I am not a a real flamboyant Speer
[44:12] speaker as I said but uh if I can as
[44:16] Paul said stir up your mind by way of
[44:19] remembrance yes to help you remember
[44:21] that what God has done and not liveing
[44:23] the past but what God has done he could
[44:26] do it again I believe the question was
[44:28] asked one time what did it mean when the
[44:30] disciples took up the 12 fragments
[44:33] basket full of fragments after Jesus had
[44:35] fed the 5,000 and the answer was that if
[44:38] he done it one time he can do it again
[44:40] amen and I'd ask you you ever been
[44:42] blessed by God and God can do it again
[44:44] you been healed by God God can do it
[44:47] again there's absolutely nothing
[44:49] impossible with him right amen our our
[44:52] secret today is putting faith in God my
[44:55] wife is going through a terrible thing
[44:57] with our she has gloma in uh in her eye
[45:00] she's just about lost her sight in her
[45:02] in her right eye Cataract and she had
[45:05] surgery and she's going through all
[45:07] kinds of injections in her eyes and
[45:09] everything but you know brother came to
[45:11] the to the church there in the little
[45:14] town of ramor and by the way I failed to
[45:17] mention they send their greetings
[45:19] brother Ln Stanley amen that brother uh
[45:22] Newton knows and he said that just
[45:24] preached the church in
[45:26] uh give them their regards but preacher
[45:28] came not long ago and he he preached and
[45:31] he prayed for Carolyn at the end of the
[45:33] uh end of the service and God made a
[45:35] promise to her and you know we like
[45:37] Miracles I like to see God do it right
[45:39] then amen but sometime it's a
[45:41] progressive thing amen when I was 12
[45:43] years old if I can just tell you this
[45:45] little testimony when I was 12 years old
[45:47] that doctors G me up to die they told my
[45:49] parents take him home put in bed give a
[45:52] Bo aspirin four times a day if he lives
[45:55] a year he'll be lucky I had acute heart
[45:59] uh romatic fever and back then they
[46:01] didn't have all the heart stuff they had
[46:03] now I went to church one night and I got
[46:05] in the prayer line and the preacher's
[46:07] name was George Jones not the country
[46:10] music singer but his name was George
[46:12] Jones he prayed for me and brother
[46:14] Newton I didn't feel anything I didn't
[46:17] shout I didn't fall out under the spirit
[46:19] I didn't run the out I didn't do nothing
[46:21] I went home the next morning I got on my
[46:24] bicycle which was one thing they told me
[46:26] never to do and I got on my bicycle and
[46:29] I took off riding through town amen amen
[46:32] I was healed and I didn't even know I
[46:34] was healed praise the Lord amen when
[46:35] they drafted from the Army the Army said
[46:37] you never had any heart trouble I said
[46:39] oh yes I did well go bring a letter from
[46:42] the doctor so I went and got letters
[46:43] from the doctors and they spelled out
[46:45] all the problems that I had how I was
[46:48] giv up to die and at the bottom of the
[46:50] page they said he was miraculously cured
[46:52] praise the Lord amen amen amen but I
[46:55] went from a last physical they said your
[46:57] heart is is about 20 years younger than
[46:59] you are so thank God for that today amen
[47:02] I just appreciate the Lord Psalms
[47:04] chapter 31 amen we'll read one verse
[47:07] there and uh then we'll read uh another
[47:11] verse over in u the 61st chapter and I
[47:15] want to get back and uh have one verse
[47:18] in Samuel Psalms chapter 31 and verse
[47:22] three for thou art my rock and my
[47:25] Fortress therefore for thy name's sake
[47:28] lead me and guide me can the church say
[47:30] amen amen that's a good prayer to pray
[47:33] lead me and guide me yes in Psalm
[47:35] chapter 61 and verse
[47:37] one the psalmist David writing again he
[47:40] said Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my
[47:43] prayer from the ends of the Earth will I
[47:46] cry unto thee when my heart is
[47:49] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[47:51] higher than I amen for thou has has been
[47:53] a shelter for me and a strong long Tower
[47:56] from my enemy thank you Lord amen now if
[47:59] I could read one more scripture in 1
[48:02] Samuel chapter
[48:05] 2 Samuel says there is none holy as the
[48:09] Lord amen for there is none besides thee
[48:13] neither is there any Rock like our God
[48:16] amen amen I just appreciate that those
[48:19] scriptures today amen God bless you
[48:22] father we thank you for your word today
[48:24] for our presence in the house of the
[48:26] Lord we pray that you just come and
[48:28] minister to us Lord give us ears to hear
[48:30] heart to receive that that you speak to
[48:33] us forgive your servant of any false
[48:35] failures or sins that would hinder your
[48:38] word from going forth today hide me
[48:40] behind the Cross May the words be those
[48:42] inspired by you and not my own in Jesus
[48:46] name amen praise the Lord God bless you
[48:49] you can have your seat we appreciate the
[48:51] Lord we're talking to brother Newton
[48:52] last night and and uh you know uh
[48:55] pastors have a a real uh responsibility
[49:00] about protecting their pull pit and not
[49:02] letting uh things come in that uh
[49:05] shouldn't be preached and kind of want
[49:07] but after talk to him for a little while
[49:09] I found out that we were we were both on
[49:11] the same playing field amen I think we
[49:13] have a pretty good balance in the
[49:15] scripture that's what it's all about is
[49:17] having a balance in the word of God
[49:18] today right and and here we have a man
[49:21] by the name of
[49:22] David and you know David was uh one that
[49:26] that God referred to him as the apple of
[49:28] his eye even when he did wrong God still
[49:31] loved him yes even when you do wrong God
[49:33] still loves you yes come on say amen
[49:36] amen when you when you make your
[49:38] mistakes God still loves you today right
[49:40] and and David you know if we look at at
[49:42] his life you know uh when when God spoke
[49:45] to Samuel and sent him down to anoint a
[49:47] king for Israel David was the most
[49:50] unlikely candidate you could find sure
[49:52] of all of his brothers that were strong
[49:55] and and muscular and probably
[49:57] intellectual and and knew all the things
[49:59] about life and whatever David was the
[50:02] least the least qualified and the least
[50:05] one that you would expect for God to
[50:07] pick to make the king out of Israel amen
[50:09] amen sometime I look and brother D I ask
[50:12] God why me yeah you know why did you
[50:14] choose me for this responsibility and
[50:16] maybe you asked yourself the same
[50:18] question have all the people in my
[50:20] family and all the people in my
[50:21] relatives and people I know why is it
[50:24] that God let me see this great truth in
[50:26] this hour and all of those others just
[50:28] go the way they go and never seem to
[50:31] carry anything even about God yes but he
[50:34] was little David you know and uh he was
[50:36] a he was a Shepherd boy and out minding
[50:39] his sheep and minding his own business
[50:41] amen and alone came God yes you know I I
[50:44] didn't go seeking for him I never went
[50:46] looking for God Amen but he came looking
[50:49] for me he may have found you taking care
[50:51] of the sheep he may found you in the
[50:53] Baptist or the Methodist or Presby or
[50:55] wherever he may have found you but when
[50:58] he came looking for you amen aren't you
[51:00] glad you were able to say Lord here am I
[51:03] amen amen it was him that impressed upon
[51:05] you what you needed to do in order to
[51:08] become a son or a daughter of God but
[51:10] David was out here taking to the Sheep
[51:12] doing nothing and and and God uh uh uh
[51:16] ended up sending him down to the valley
[51:19] V where his brothers were in the fox
[51:22] holes you know peeping out looking at
[51:24] this massive giant called gath and and
[51:27] you know the story how that David went
[51:28] out and his reputation began to be buil
[51:32] amen and the fact that he said you know
[51:34] I come to you Amen in the name of the
[51:36] Lord you come to me with your swords and
[51:39] your Spears and your Shields I come to
[51:41] you in the name of the Lord I don't know
[51:44] about you church but today my defense is
[51:46] this book right here hallelujah it's not
[51:48] in my intellect it's not in what I know
[51:51] it's not in what I studied but it's in
[51:53] this word today amen because that word
[51:56] is my absolute right praise the Lord but
[51:59] David you know he grew and uh they they
[52:02] told him said you know the one that
[52:03] kills this giant gets to marry the
[52:05] King's Daughter and you know how David's
[52:07] life progressed he ended up marrying the
[52:09] King's Daughter becoming best friends
[52:11] with the King's son and whatever and
[52:13] things were going real well there was
[52:16] nothing to be said everything was going
[52:18] fine but let me tell you something I
[52:20] don't know about your life but when
[52:22] things start going good the devil shows
[52:24] up because he doesn't want your life to
[52:28] have any peace he wants to come he wants
[52:30] to money the waters he wants to trouble
[52:33] the waters he wants to disrupt the unity
[52:36] that you have between you and God Amen
[52:38] now I know this that he cannot destroy
[52:41] the plan of God for my life right amen
[52:44] but he can come and he can muddy the
[52:46] waters he can trouble the waters some
[52:48] people say that when when uh Eve failed
[52:51] in the Garden of Eden that that the
[52:53] devil destroyed the pl man of God no he
[52:56] just interrupted it he just he just uh
[52:59] uhh send it a different direction and
[53:02] let me tell you God was not surprised at
[53:04] what happened in the garden of Ed amen
[53:07] right he was not surprised because he
[53:08] had already before the foundation of the
[53:11] world slew a lamb Amen to remedy what
[53:14] was taking place back there amen amen
[53:18] yes but here was David you know and and
[53:20] uh uh you would think that he never had
[53:22] any problems You' think that may your
[53:25] pastor never has any problems hello
[53:28] welcome to our world yeah amen you would
[53:31] think that you know David didn't have
[53:32] any problems but evidently he did
[53:35] because here the scripture said amen
[53:37] here oh Lord amen attend to my prayer
[53:40] from the ends of the Earth when I cry
[53:42] into thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[53:46] right now I know nobody here has those
[53:48] kind of problems the devil doesn't give
[53:50] you this is Arizona you don't have the
[53:52] problems like we have in North Carolina
[53:54] but let me tell of the devil is Alive
[53:56] and Well back in the East yes amen he
[53:59] has not he has not let up one bit but
[54:02] David said I am overwhelmed you know
[54:04] what that word overwhelmed means that
[54:07] means totally destroyed just about
[54:10] totally brought up down wow and he was a
[54:12] man that oh he he sung he went out he he
[54:15] slew Bears he slew Lions amen he slew
[54:18] Giants and here he is at his very lowest
[54:21] moment said Lord I'm overwhelmed with
[54:24] yes I don't know about you but I've been
[54:26] there yes I've been there I've been to
[54:28] the place that I felt like I was totally
[54:31] overwhelmed that there was no way out of
[54:33] this battle there was no way out of this
[54:35] problem there was no way out of this
[54:37] trouble for me but God always makes the
[54:40] way Hallelujah I got news for you before
[54:43] there was a problem there was an answer
[54:45] before there was a sickness there was a
[54:47] Healer before you ever got in trouble
[54:49] God made a way for you to get out of
[54:51] trouble hallelujah amen that's the kind
[54:54] of God he is the
[54:55] amen but David said I'm overwhelmed amen
[54:59] but we read the scripture in Psalms 31
[55:02] he said Thou Art my rock yes amen the
[55:06] thing I love about a rock that it's
[55:08] secure amen it doesn't just wishy-washy
[55:11] amen amen the only thing that can change
[55:13] a Rock Amen is a constant force of water
[55:17] the only thing can change a rock is a
[55:19] constant force amen of the spirit of God
[55:22] moving amen and I tell you what I want
[55:25] that constant force of the spirit of God
[55:27] moving every day if there's anything in
[55:30] our lives that we don't need that we
[55:31] don't we we shouldn't have then we need
[55:34] the spirit of God just to come and to
[55:36] purchase every day amen amen yes David
[55:39] said when I'm
[55:41] overwhelmed lead me to that rock right
[55:44] if I can get to the Rock if I can get to
[55:47] that place at the very lowest moment
[55:50] amen when he was feeling all the
[55:52] pressure and and like you said brother
[55:56] I don't guess we have to title these
[55:57] messages but if we put a title on we
[56:00] just call it living under the pressure
[56:02] amen because as as we get closer to the
[56:05] coming of the Lord you believe he's
[56:08] coming oh yeah yes sir amen amen I've
[56:10] heard it all my life but I believe he's
[56:12] he's closer now than he ever has been
[56:14] amen but the closer we get to the coming
[56:17] of the Lord and the enemy amen sees his
[56:20] time being shortened amen every day that
[56:22] goes by his time is being shortened he
[56:25] launches a greater and a stronger war
[56:28] against each and every I'm going through
[56:31] things today Amen in my life that I
[56:33] never thought I would go through before
[56:35] amen you know when I I was raised in a
[56:37] Pentecostal trinitarian church and and
[56:40] and and evolved into a a Wess
[56:42] Pentecostal church and then evolved into
[56:44] this that's the evolution I went through
[56:47] amen but one day God revealed a message
[56:49] to me yes amen and I I reached that
[56:51] state of perfection in the word amen
[56:54] Lord but you know
[56:55] at his very moment at the very lowest
[56:58] moment when he was feeling all this
[57:00] pressure amen and you know we're living
[57:03] in now some people live a lifetime and
[57:06] never see but maybe one or two
[57:08] prophecies amen come about yeah you and
[57:11] I are living in an hour in a moment when
[57:13] we're seeing prophecy being fulfilled
[57:16] every single day we're seeing the word
[57:18] of God spoken in uh the word spoken in
[57:21] the written word we''re seeing the word
[57:23] spoken by the prophet we're see in
[57:25] events of the hour transpiring every day
[57:28] that tell us that the coming of the Lord
[57:30] is not at hand yes I believe that amen
[57:33] amen but we live though no people some
[57:35] people have only seen one or two but you
[57:37] and I are living in the hour when we're
[57:39] seing it happen each and every day
[57:41] praise the Lord but you know what
[57:43] happens when prophecy begins to be
[57:45] fulfilled it brings pressure amen amen
[57:48] when prophecy begins to be fulfilled
[57:50] when we seeing the word of God coming to
[57:52] pass and all these other things that are
[57:54] happened amen it stirs hell yes excuse
[57:58] me but it just stirs hell devil gets mad
[58:00] yes amen he he realized is his time is
[58:03] short
[58:05] amen right but when that word begins to
[58:09] fulfill be fulfilled amen we see all the
[58:12] things of God and you know in the days
[58:14] of prophecy about Jesus there were
[58:16] wonderful Zachariah and Isaiah amen and
[58:19] all these words that went forth
[58:20] concerning the Lord the promise was real
[58:23] but the pressure amen begin to mount yes
[58:26] amen and this it's the same way today
[58:29] that pressure begins to mount each and
[58:31] every day every time God brings about a
[58:33] promise amen a little more pressure the
[58:36] devil puts a little more pressure on you
[58:38] to believe what God said come on yes
[58:41] puts a little more pressure on you to
[58:42] believe what God Said Amen because if he
[58:46] can get you to disbelieve you know the
[58:48] devil doesn't care if you go to church
[58:51] right amen just F he doesn't care if you
[58:53] go to church
[58:55] amen but if he can get you to disbelieve
[58:58] one word of this scripture that's all
[59:00] that Eve done was disbelieve one word
[59:02] amen amen but what if how can it be I
[59:07] tell you how it can be just like Mary
[59:09] said the Holy Ghost will do it amen when
[59:12] I can't do it the Holy Ghost will do it
[59:14] when I can't overcome the Holy Ghost
[59:16] living in me amen uh uh and that's the
[59:19] way it is I'm not an overcomer right
[59:21] Amen in myself but with him in me I am
[59:25] overcome Revelation said to him that
[59:27] overcometh will I grant to sit on the
[59:29] throne with me as I have overcome and
[59:32] sit on the throne with my father prise
[59:34] the Lord I've got a position guaranteed
[59:37] amen amen yes sir when we see that
[59:40] prophecy being fulfilled amen it only
[59:43] make us happy and we are yes amen we are
[59:47] happy about it amen because listen
[59:49] Church a lot of times you look and you
[59:51] say well everything's wrong amen but
[59:54] when everything's wrong everything is
[59:55] right yes because when everything's
[59:57] wrong we see amen God bringing
[59:59] everything into fulfillment right right
[1:00:03] amen but when we see this happening
[1:00:06] Along Comes the pressure we you know
[1:00:09] brother Brown said there's coming a
[1:00:10] squeeze right
[1:00:12] hello let me announce amen we have been
[1:00:15] pressured yes you know I was reading
[1:00:18] foxy book of Martyrs the last couple
[1:00:20] days in fact I had it on the plane with
[1:00:22] been reading uh the last few pages of it
[1:00:25] when I come up and I thought about you
[1:00:27] know the the people that the that the
[1:00:29] enemy destroyed literally physically
[1:00:32] amen and some of the things that you
[1:00:33] read in that in that book at what the
[1:00:35] Believers went through and how they gave
[1:00:37] their lives physically amen but you know
[1:00:40] what the enemy found out he could not he
[1:00:42] could not annihilate the church
[1:00:44] physically right amen so he came about
[1:00:48] with a with a new plan amen and it's
[1:00:50] called deceit it's called uh it's called
[1:00:52] getting people amen to be at ease and
[1:00:55] Zion it's called a a spirit so near like
[1:00:58] the original that it would deceive the
[1:01:00] very elect amen you know the enemy comes
[1:01:02] to us in three different ways he came as
[1:01:04] a as a subtle serpent to the to even the
[1:01:07] Garden of Eden amen he came as a roaring
[1:01:10] line amen destroying the physical life
[1:01:12] of many Believers amen through the Dark
[1:01:14] Ages but here he is in this hour amen
[1:01:17] presenting himself as an angel of light
[1:01:19] come on right to tell you this is all
[1:01:22] right and that's all right and it's it's
[1:01:24] it doesn't mean this and God didn't mean
[1:01:26] that but listen when God said it he
[1:01:28] meant it yes am we see this prophecy
[1:01:31] fulfilled in the pressure that's coming
[1:01:32] on you know there there's a war going on
[1:01:35] over in Israel MH yes sir amen people
[1:01:38] are dying every day

[1:01:44] that pressure amen that war is
[1:01:47] fulfillment of God's word yes amen
[1:01:50] because listen the world as a majority

[1:02:12] home I said listen the wars in Israel
[1:02:15] the war against Israel those people will
[1:02:17] never defeat Israel amen but what they
[1:02:20] will do they will quickly usher in the
[1:02:23] coming of the Lord lord it's going to
[1:02:25] make the coming of the Lord amen just
[1:02:27] moving in faster and faster and quicker
[1:02:30] and quicker prise the Lord amen it's
[1:02:32] bringing us closer to that yes you say

[1:02:58] send a deliverer yes amen amen well when
[1:03:01] they began when when when the when the

[1:03:21] all of Egypt out of him amen amen so
[1:03:24] time it may take 40 years to get
[1:03:26] everything out of you but that's what it
[1:03:28] takes amen but the but one day brother

[1:04:22] and bring you out 400 years is they had

[1:04:39] straw yeah amen as this prophecy began
[1:04:42] to fulfill that I'll send a deliverer it

[1:44:27] happened amen amen we just have to live
[1:44:30] that standard we just have to be the

[1:44:34] that when the enemy comes in like a
[1:44:36] flood he does what he raises the
[1:44:39] standard which does what puts the devil
[1:44:41] underneath you that's right praise the
