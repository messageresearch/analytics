[35:55] fleece you know put a fleece there you
[35:57] know sometimes we're afraid to put a
[35:58] fleece i'll speak for myself uh because
[36:01] we think it ain't gonna happen or it
[36:02] ain't gonna happen that way or something
[36:04] like that but i was thinking well
[36:06] whether it's no or yes you know it's
[36:08] still good it's god's answer you know no
[36:10] word yes amen so i said lord i said well

[36:33] know we know that that's him yeah you
[36:35] didn't do you have nothing to do with
[36:36] him

[41:41] leave
[41:42] amen i'm going to look something up real
[41:44] quick because
[41:45] it just came on my heart and like
[41:47] brother john said we'd
[41:49] like to try to obey the lord yes and
[41:52] something came uh came on my heart and
[41:55] when he sang that amazing grace
[41:57] i don't know why it ever struck me maybe
[42:00] just because of what's going on now but
[42:02] it ever struck me
[42:04] the way it did
[42:06] for
[42:07] the second verse
[42:09] and
[42:12] it made me it made me think about a
[42:14] quote that brother
[42:18] zavala had read
[42:19] at brother frank's funeral
[42:22] and
[42:23] if i actually can have reception here
[42:25] i'll try to find this quote if i don't
[42:27] have reception maybe i'm not supposed to
[42:28] find it
[42:33] [Music]
[42:35] but you look at you see that second
[42:36] verse there
[42:38] see the first first part of that second
[42:40] verse
[42:42] it says
[42:44] here we go
[42:46] it says twas grace that taught my heart
[42:50] to fear
[42:52] and it was grace
[42:54] that relieved my fears or graced my
[42:57] fears relieve of course as the poetic
[42:59] verse goes in the in the poem of how
[43:01] they write it but basically it's saying
[43:04] grace relieved my fears
[43:06] amen and you remember that john newton
[43:09] wrote this and under the circumstances
[43:11] that he wrote it i mean he was in fear
[43:13] for his life
[43:15] but it was grace that came into his
[43:17] pathway that relieved his fear
[43:20] and you know as we've said
[43:22] for over a year now fear has just
[43:23] dripped the world and the coveted fears
[43:26] just absolutely ransacked the world
[43:28] today and people are just and and like
[43:30] we read the other day men's hearts
[43:32] failing for fear
[43:34] but i i remember this quote that brother
[43:36] zavala read and um sorry to leave you
[43:41] standing but
[43:42] uh
[43:43] he actually says in a couple of places
[43:46] but i want to read it to you
[43:49] um
[43:51] things that are to be there are several
[43:53] places he says this actually
[43:55] he says but i am glad listen this now
[43:58] listen this you're streaming today
[44:00] things that are to be december 5th 196
[44:03] about 10 days
[44:05] before brother branham's accident
[44:07] it wasn't 10 days the 15th
[44:09] or 14th
[44:11] anyway it was right
[44:14] 20 days later brother branham's gone
[44:17] brother graham says i'm glad
[44:19] that there's something to get us out of
[44:21] this pest house
[44:23] and people scared to death of dying
[44:25] right of course some people
[44:27] unfortunately in the way they're living
[44:29] their lives they should be scared to die
[44:32] but he said i'm so glad that there's
[44:34] something to get us out of this pest
[44:36] house
[44:37] what a differing view that what you hear
[44:38] from most people today right amen
[44:41] to get us out of this pest house yes
[44:44] there's an open door and it's called
[44:47] death
[44:48] jesus stands in that door amen he'll
[44:52] guide me over the river he'll take me
[44:54] through that door
[44:55] there's a great door standing yonder
[44:58] called death and every time your heart
[45:00] beats you're one beat closer to it and
[45:03] someday
[45:04] listen this grace my fears relieved
[45:08] grace relieved my fears he said in some
[45:11] day
[45:12] i must come to that door
[45:15] you must come to that door
[45:18] but when i come there i don't want to be
[45:20] a coward
[45:22] amen
[45:24] brother says when i come to that door i
[45:26] don't want to be a coward i don't want
[45:28] to come streaming back off he said i
[45:30] want to come to that door and wrap
[45:32] myself in his robe of righteousness amen
[45:35] praise the lord amen that's wonderful
[45:38] brother just off that little leading you
[45:40] had for that song there and the lord's
[45:43] showing me that i could probably just
[45:44] take a whole another sermon but we i've
[45:46] got something else in my heart for today
[45:49] but it is so wonderful that god relieves
[45:53] our fears his grace relieves our fears
[45:57] and brings us
[45:58] someday we're looking for a rapture and
[46:01] we've been preaching on the rapture that
[46:02] we won't taste death but if time would
[46:05] tarry every one of us will come to that
[46:07] door yeah brother ram said i'm so glad
[46:10] that door is there
[46:12] jesus is at that door waiting to receive
[46:14] us i won't have to cross jordan alone
[46:17] amen thank you lord and i don't want to
[46:20] go as a coward right screaming yelling
[46:23] right i just want to say
[46:25] here i am lord wrote wrap me in your
[46:28] robe of righteousness and i might step
[46:30] into your presence and jesus will say
[46:33] enter into the glories of the lord it
[46:35] has been well done my good and faithful
[46:37] servant
[46:38] amen
[46:39] isn't that a wonderful thing why would
[46:41] anybody when you're when you
[46:43] literally know by faith that you're
[46:46] facing that why would anybody be afraid
[46:50] why would anybody be scared of death
[46:52] under those circumstances yes i have to
[46:55] echo his sentiment i'm glad there's
[46:57] something that'll get me out of this
[46:59] pest house amen
[47:01] praise the lord and the older you get
[47:03] the more pesky it seems to
[47:05] you don't realize that maybe when you're
[47:07] younger i didn't realize it when i was
[47:09] younger but the older i get the real the
[47:11] more i realize how rotten and pesty it
[47:13] really is
[47:14] amen but i'm thankful to god that he
[47:17] give us a way of escape
[47:19] amen a way of escape
[47:20] praise the lord now while you're
[47:22] standing i got something else i want to
[47:23] talk about for just a moment but while
[47:25] you're standing let's read the bible
[47:26] i'll let you be seated
[47:29] uh first thessalonians chapter i thought
[47:31] uh brother john did an awesome job amen
[47:34] amen awesome job i love the music uh
[47:37] brother zach and mike i saw him
[47:40] working with each other on the keys and
[47:41] stuff i love that just uh just
[47:45] praise the lord amen praise the lord on
[47:48] the musical instruments amen and brother
[47:50] john used his musical instrument and
[47:52] brother zach and the talent god give him
[47:54] and mike and the talent god give him and
[47:56] amen amen i just just it'd been on my
[47:58] heart for a little while even maybe
[48:00] since country club to uh maybe try to
[48:03] have brother john sing
[48:05] lead songs a little bit more and uh zach
[48:08] played the guitar and
[48:10] now we just get tapped up and play the
[48:12] organ piano thing and we'll be in we'll
[48:14] be good now a good barrister and she's
[48:16] mad at me but anyway
[48:18] i don't care because she has a talent
[48:21] too yes and i i
[48:24] i for one as you probably already know
[48:26] hate to see talent sitting in jesus
[48:30] i like to see it being utilized and for
[48:32] the glory of the lord amen the glory of
[48:35] the lord amen god didn't give us to hide
[48:37] them under a bushel right he gave us we
[48:40] could use them for him so first
[48:41] thessalonians chapter 4 back to the same
[48:44] place we've started the past 11
[48:46] services the rapture part 12. we're
[48:49] going to start with verse 13 again like
[48:51] we've had the rapture part 12.
[48:54] amen i think we're i was looking at it
[48:57] yesterday and going over some things and
[48:59] it felt like we were kind of nearing it
[49:00] into this but we'll see however the lord
[49:02] leads it but
[49:04] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13.
[49:06] before we read the word again let's just
[49:08] bow our hearts for another word of
[49:10] prayer
[49:11] father god we're certainly grateful of
[49:13] all that you've done for us and given to
[49:15] us today sometimes lord it's just as it
[49:18] struck me when that song and
[49:20] brother john was singing that there lord
[49:23] i don't know how many times i've sang
[49:25] amazing grace i don't know how many
[49:27] times i've been in church and i've led
[49:29] that song or i've sang that song and
[49:32] but for some reason that second verse
[49:34] and what's going on in the world today
[49:35] just spoke to my heart so close
[49:38] and lord we thank you father for that
[49:40] grace that amazing grace that you give
[49:42] in our lives that that rapturing grace
[49:45] that that faith lord that we can have to
[49:48] know god that it was grace that saved us
[49:51] through faith and yes we thank you
[49:53] father that by that grace it relieves
[49:55] our fear because we know by faith
[49:58] that we're yours and may god when it
[50:01] comes time for you to call us home i i
[50:03] just appreciate that quote from brother
[50:04] branham and lord this pest house would
[50:07] give way to your uh celestial body god
[50:11] that you've given us and lord we're
[50:13] looking forward to that day we're
[50:14] looking forward to the time father that
[50:16] that you call us home to be with you but

[50:27] you've given it for us to do while we're
[50:29] here and have breath in our bodies
[50:31] may we take every breath and every
[50:33] heartbeat like brother adam said and use
[50:35] it for your glory and honor somehow some
[50:38] way lord if we could do it god and lord
[50:41] that may be just providing for our
[50:42] families it may be just uh uh giving a
[50:45] witness to somebody it may be just
[50:47] bowing our heads at a dinner table and
[50:49] praying in a restaurant or somewhere
[50:51] lord god it could mean anything but god
[50:53] we want to do it for your glory and
[50:55] honor whatever it is
[50:57] we thank you god for all that you've
[50:58] done for us given to us for this service
[51:00] today for those that have come may you
[51:02] just bless us lord may your spirit move
[51:05] now father in a special powerful
[51:08] supernatural way god as you always do
[51:11] sweet through this place once again god

[51:15] to feel your presence and know you real
[51:18] father if they're streaming today god
[51:20] sweep through their living room sweep to
[51:22] their homes wherever they are god and
[51:24] lord may that power come may every sick
[51:27] body be healed may every downtrodden
[51:29] heart be encouraged may every depressed
[51:32] spirit be uplifted today god may every
[51:34] high place be made low every rough place
[51:36] smooth every curry play straight because
[51:39] you jesus visited us today
[51:42] we rebuke every demonic spirit lord in
[51:44] the name of jesus christ it would try to
[51:46] hurt hinderer infiltrate this service in
[51:49] any way and that you would get the glory
[51:51] honor and praise for all that is said
[51:52] and done we give you thanks for it now
[51:54] in the random part of the service into
[51:56] your hands in the name of the lord jesus
[51:58] christ we pray amen amen
[52:02] first thessalonians 4 13
[52:05] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[52:07] brother concerning them which are asleep
[52:08] that ye sorrow not even as others which
[52:10] have no hope for if we believe that
[52:13] jesus died and rose again even so them
[52:15] also would sleep in jesus will god bring
[52:18] with him
[52:19] for this we say unto you by the word of
[52:21] the lord that we which are alive and
[52:22] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[52:24] not prevent them which are asleep for
[52:26] the lord himself shall descend from
[52:28] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[52:30] the archangel with the trump of god and
[52:32] the dead in christ shall rise first then
[52:34] we which are alive and remain shall be
[52:36] caught up together with them in the
[52:37] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[52:39] so shall we ever be with the lord
[52:42] wherefore comfort one another with these
[52:44] words you could be seated if you'd like
[52:48] amen i think it's a a wonderful thing
[52:51] that the testimonies that brother dennis
[52:53] gave and brother john gave you recognize
[52:56] that we all need something like that
[52:58] right amen we all need something like
[53:00] that that witness that the lord gives
[53:02] each one of us individually let us know
[53:04] how much he's mindful of us
[53:07] brother dennis with his pennies and
[53:09] brother john with his numbers and
[53:10] whatever it is it's that identification
[53:13] that god gives to you and however god
[53:15] comes to you and however it is in your
[53:17] life it means something to you to let
[53:20] you know how mindful he is of you
[53:22] everybody amen
[53:23] and that's important it's important for
[53:26] every one of us to to have something
[53:28] like that uh some people may say oh
[53:30] that's carl no it's not
[53:32] no
[53:33] how many times does god use the carnal
[53:35] to vindicate his word amen to vindicate
[53:38] his promises to bring them to pass
[53:41] amen whatever it might be works in the
[53:43] same way in our lives in each one of us
[53:46] so
[53:46] i appreciate those testimonies they
[53:48] meant a lot to me and i thank god for it
[53:50] now last week
[53:53] one of the quotes i read actually the
[53:54] first quote i read
[53:56] and as
[53:57] as the hurricane was lashing at the
[54:00] doors of new orleans last sunday morning
[54:03] i read this quote
[54:05] and it was the first one that the lord
[54:07] gave me last week when i was studying
[54:09] and this quote became so prevalent on my
[54:11] heart all week
[54:13] as i saw what unfolded with the things
[54:16] that took place in the world in this
[54:18] country not in the world just in this
[54:19] country now the world of course and
[54:21] things that's going on around us but in
[54:23] this country i'm going to read this
[54:25] quote again listen
[54:26] it's in the it's in the church age book
[54:29] and the exposition of the church age the
[54:31] laodicean church age and he's talking
[54:33] about of course the exhortation in
[54:36] revelation 3 of god giving to the
[54:39] laodicean church age poor miserable
[54:41] blind wretched naked
[54:43] he said they are miserable
[54:45] that means they are objects to be pity
[54:48] pitied they scorn pity they are full of
[54:52] pride
[54:54] they want what they have but what they
[54:57] have will not stand the test of time in
[55:00] other words they bought what they have
[55:01] but what they have is not worth vaunting
[55:03] right right they boast in what they have
[55:05] but what they have is not worth boasting
[55:07] about right
[55:09] they have built listen this now
[55:11] they have built upon quicksand rather
[55:14] than the rock of the revelation of god's
[55:16] word
[55:18] soon cometh the earthquake
[55:21] soon
[55:23] soon
[55:25] soon there will come the storms of the
[55:27] wrath of god in judgment
[55:30] amen
[55:32] then comes sudden destruction
[55:36] sudden destruction
[55:38] how many
[55:39] uh 60 people or so now i've lost their
[55:41] lives just because of this one hurricane
[55:44] and very few down on the gulf coast it's
[55:46] all in the northeast
[55:49] sudden destruction and in spite of all
[55:51] their carnal preparation they will be
[55:54] they will still be unprepared for what
[55:57] comes upon the earth
[55:59] they are those who in spite of all their
[56:02] worldly efforts are actually opposing
[56:05] themselves and they don't know it
[56:09] now when that
[56:10] when all that happened unfolded this
[56:12] week
[56:14] i'm thinking california's burning to the
[56:15] ground
[56:16] and floods are washing people away in
[56:18] the northeast
[56:20] and of course like i said last week they
[56:23] and we talked about the signs in heaven
[56:25] and earth last week and uh tried to
[56:27] finish that up it helped to see now the
[56:31] things that at this end time of what's
[56:34] unfolding around us and we don't want to
[56:36] be ignorant of those things sister
[56:38] matisse of course talked about the
[56:40] scriptural reference of you want to know
[56:42] what time it is look at israel which is
[56:44] very pertinent of course scriptural
[56:47] also we look at the other things that
[56:49] god gave us that we recognize are signs
[56:52] that we can see unfolding before us
[56:54] israel is the biggest one
[56:56] all the other things that unfolding
[56:58] around us helps us realize
[57:00] man tries to reason it all away but they
[57:03] cannot reason it away they try to
[57:06] explain it they try to prepare
[57:07] themselves for it they try to do
[57:09] everything they can but they're
[57:11] ill-prepared for what's coming because
[57:13] they've trusted in themselves and
[57:15] building upon the sand of their own
[57:17] knowledge instead of the revelation of
[57:20] the rock of god's word
[57:21] and his promises and if you don't build
[57:24] your foundation on the rock of the word
[57:26] of god it will fall every time and it's
[57:30] falling all around us yes now they want
[57:33] to beg trillions of dollars out of you
[57:36] to try to fix this
[57:37] as they call climate change but we
[57:39] talked about that the other day too amen
[57:42] and and the things that's going on and
[57:44] there is climate changing there is
[57:47] things that's happening around the world
[57:48] we know that um
[57:50] uh i i don't trust a lot of the science
[57:54] that goes into it
[57:55] because unfortunately friend and i don't
[57:57] mean to be cynical but uh these people
[58:01] who give these prognostications
[58:03] are people who get billions of dollars
[58:06] in grant money every year from the
[58:08] government right
[58:09] if you don't have that
[58:11] you don't get the money
[58:14] the money drives up so if climate change
[58:17] as they preach it were to go away so
[58:20] with their money hmm
[58:21] well the money's not going to go away
[58:23] because they're not going to quit
[58:24] harping on this and then the next thing
[58:26] you know here comes
[58:28] our leader and it comes out it's climate
[58:30] change and we've got to have three and a
[58:32] half actually probably five trillion
[58:34] dollars to combat all of this
[58:37] they'll be ill-prepared right for what's
[58:40] happening he said coming but what is
[58:43] happening right now
[58:44] things they have no answer to
[58:47] things they cannot do anything about
[58:50] wildfires raging of course in california
[58:53] i don't know of any other place it is
[58:55] and there's nothing they can do about it
[58:58] i mean there's something they can do and
[59:00] god bless those firefighters they're
[59:01] they're doing their best to try to put
[59:04] this thing out and all but
[59:07] what gains are they making
[59:09] you understand
[59:10] these things are happening and and we
[59:13] believe them to be by the hand of god
[59:16] god is allowing these things to happen
[59:18] now some of this stuff happened because
[59:20] of human negligence of course i believe
[59:23] that right the bible says god will
[59:25] destroy those that destroy the world
[59:28] and i know that's happening
[59:30] but
[59:30] the only place of safety is that the ark
[59:33] of the word is in the spirit and
[59:37] and the ark of god's word that's the
[59:38] only safe place there is if you get
[59:40] outside of that that's why brother
[59:42] branham said there at the end he said uh
[59:44] uh
[59:45] in one of those
[59:46] quotes i i think i may have read it last
[59:48] week uh i can't remember uh that brother
[59:52] graham talked about the only safe place
[59:54] of course is is in christ
[59:56] that's the only place you can get in and
[59:58] be safe right it's the only place you
[1:00:00] can get it hides from the devil to hide
[1:00:03] from the world
[1:00:04] um
[1:00:06] i think it was christ the mystery god
[1:00:07] revealed he said you know get get away
[1:00:10] from the world get out of the world get
[1:00:12] get as far away from the things and the
[1:00:14] love of the world as you can
[1:00:16] get into christ the only safe place
[1:00:18] there is yes now part 12
[1:00:20] uh i was going to try to make this a
[1:00:22] little shorter but um
[1:00:24] and we'll see because uh uh going to
[1:00:27] have a little lunch and then drive down
[1:00:28] to sierra vista this afternoon and
[1:00:30] brother roger's service starts at 4 30
[1:00:32] and it's hour and a half to get there so
[1:00:34] um
[1:00:35] let's get to the rapture part 12 now
[1:00:38] i just i just felt on my heart that was
[1:00:41] just been burning on my heart since i
[1:00:42] read this uh since i read this last week
[1:00:46] last sunday and then what transpired
[1:00:48] over the over the course of this week
[1:00:51] with the hurricane the fires and the
[1:00:53] proclamation of this trillions of
[1:00:55] dollars and all that i i just felt like
[1:00:57] you know you can put
[1:01:00] what's higher than trillions i don't
[1:01:02] even know you could put a bazillion
[1:01:04] trillion dollars into it and they'll
[1:01:06] still be unprepared for what's about to
[1:01:08] hit this plan yes amen
[1:01:12] it's just gonna
[1:01:14] rock and reel and it's just gonna
[1:01:16] brother adam said even the atmospheres
[1:01:18] will explode
[1:01:20] kill every single speck of sin on this
[1:01:24] planet because we're going to god's
[1:01:26] people will come back and live here now
[1:01:28] i want to talk about for a few minutes
[1:01:32] and a state of enrapturement or being
[1:01:35] enraptured
[1:01:37] uh because a lot of times we view the
[1:01:40] rapture as we should as a singular event
[1:01:44] that takes place at the culmination of
[1:01:47] the gentile
[1:01:48] age
[1:01:49] the gentile dispensation of gentile
[1:01:52] bride dispensation because the gentile
[1:01:54] dispensation will continue on after the
[1:01:56] rapture brother bam said the laodicea
[1:01:58] goes on into perdition well the bride
[1:02:00] leaves long before that
[1:02:02] but
[1:02:02] but it for the bride it culminates at
[1:02:05] that point of a rapture a singular event
[1:02:08] of a of a mass body change of of god's
[1:02:13] children around the world
[1:02:15] to be translated and to go into a
[1:02:18] rapture to meet the lord in the air
[1:02:20] that's what we consider that second
[1:02:22] coming of the lord to be that coming is
[1:02:24] we go to him we call it a coming but
[1:02:27] actually we go
[1:02:29] to him
[1:02:30] actually in this as we refer to as his
[1:02:33] second coming we go to him
[1:02:36] but this enrapturement is something that
[1:02:38] really is a for a christian
[1:02:41] this enragement is actually a perpetual
[1:02:44] existence
[1:02:45] it is something that a child of god
[1:02:48] lives in
[1:02:49] it's where they are it's where they
[1:02:51] exist
[1:02:52] a child of god lives in a place of
[1:02:55] enrapturement every day of their lives
[1:02:58] amen and i want to show a couple of
[1:03:00] examples of that and bring some
[1:03:02] scripture but understanding that we
[1:03:05] we have already been caught up out of
[1:03:08] this world
[1:03:09] the bride has already been caught up out
[1:03:12] of this cosmos this world the bride has
[1:03:16] already been caught up out of laodicea
[1:03:19] into a bride age this uh this bride has
[1:03:22] already been caught up or enraptured
[1:03:24] into heavenly places
[1:03:27] she's already living there she's in a
[1:03:29] different dimension amen
[1:03:32] now our bodies are still here our human
[1:03:35] bodies are still here in this sport in
[1:03:36] this uh fourth dimension but there's
[1:03:39] there's a place that uh that that the
[1:03:41] spirit of man that that that our soul is
[1:03:44] is enraptured into
[1:03:47] to a place that uh
[1:03:49] that you can't see
[1:03:50] you might not can touch it feel it right
[1:03:53] but but it's there it exists and it's
[1:03:55] where the bride lives
[1:03:58] it's where she lives amen let's read
[1:04:00] ephesians chapter two
[1:04:03] uh i'll begin with the first verse
[1:04:10] ephesians chapter 2.
[1:04:14] now like i said i usually take a little
[1:04:16] more liberties because we don't have an
[1:04:18] evening service
[1:04:20] but i was trying to
[1:04:22] hone this one down maybe just a little
[1:04:24] bit more
[1:04:25] due to my particular time constraints
[1:04:28] anyway of uh trying to get a bite to eat
[1:04:30] and driving down the sierra vista this
[1:04:32] afternoon so
[1:04:33] um
[1:04:34] but uh but i don't want to be
[1:04:36] disobedient to the lord either
[1:04:39] amen ephesians chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:04:44] and you
[1:04:46] have he quickened
[1:04:48] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:04:51] now we all know what the word quickened
[1:04:53] means means to be made alive very much
[1:04:56] amen so we were once dead
[1:05:00] because we were born in sins shaped
[1:05:02] iniquity come in the world speaking
[1:05:03] lines
[1:05:04] so we were born now this might sound
[1:05:07] like a paradox
[1:05:08] but we were born dead
[1:05:12] we were born dead you say well i was
[1:05:14] alive uh doctors spanked me i screamed
[1:05:18] and i was determined to live breath come
[1:05:20] in my lungs and i'm living today i was
[1:05:22] alive
[1:05:23] i always make this uh joke of
[1:05:27] a lot of times people ask brother roger
[1:05:29] if he played basketball because you know
[1:05:31] he's six foot seven and brother rogers
[1:05:33] no he never played basketball
[1:05:35] and i always told people when they asked
[1:05:37] me
[1:05:38] uh if
[1:05:40] i'd tell them especially if i was when i
[1:05:42] was driving uber so from north carolina
[1:05:44] it's all you like basketball play
[1:05:45] basketball because you know it's a big
[1:05:47] basketball hub i said i said of course i
[1:05:50] played basketball i said when you're
[1:05:51] born
[1:05:52] when you're born a male in north
[1:05:54] carolina the doctor doesn't spank you he
[1:05:57] gives you a basketball and if you can
[1:05:58] dribble you're alive
[1:06:01] that's how they determine whether you're
[1:06:02] alive as a as a male newborn in north
[1:06:05] carolina you have to be able to dribble
[1:06:07] a basketball but
[1:06:09] we are born again as
[1:06:11] paradoxical as it may seem we are born
[1:06:14] dead
[1:06:15] born in sin iniquity speaking life sin
[1:06:17] is
[1:06:18] sin is a perpetual state of death right
[1:06:21] amen that that is a perpetual state of
[1:06:24] death sin is death it's sin is
[1:06:26] separation from god death is separation
[1:06:29] you live in sin you live dead you're
[1:06:31] born in sin shape nick become the world
[1:06:33] speaking lives so we were once dead
[1:06:37] but god quickened us
[1:06:39] made us alive
[1:06:41] so what does that tell us that tells us
[1:06:44] that those who were quickened those who
[1:06:46] are made alive
[1:06:47] which i believe were a part of
[1:06:50] the rest of the of humanity if you will
[1:06:53] are living dead
[1:06:55] now i'm not advocating zombies the
[1:06:58] living dead
[1:06:59] but spiritually they are dead while
[1:07:02] they're yet a living right yes amen
[1:07:04] they're dead dead in their sins amen
[1:07:07] dead in their sins god has quickened us
[1:07:10] now so that in itself shows us
[1:07:14] that for god's children there's been
[1:07:18] a change
[1:07:20] or a a an elevation
[1:07:23] a a
[1:07:25] a state of being alive
[1:07:27] where once we were dead now we are alive
[1:07:30] so we are living our lives spiritually
[1:07:34] alive
[1:07:35] the rest of the world is living their
[1:07:37] lives spiritually dead so they're dead
[1:07:39] so this already shows a differentiation
[1:07:43] between what the world is and how they
[1:07:45] live and what the bride is in god's
[1:07:47] children and how they are to what they
[1:07:49] live and how they live
[1:07:50] there's a difference amen okay verse two
[1:07:53] wherein in time past ye walked according
[1:07:57] to the course of this world
[1:07:59] according to the prince of the power of
[1:08:01] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:08:03] the children of disobedience so there
[1:08:05] still are
[1:08:07] children of disobedience
[1:08:09] well if there are children of
[1:08:10] disobedience there are children of
[1:08:13] obedience
[1:08:14] amen amen there can't be a children of
[1:08:16] disobedience unless there's a children
[1:08:19] of obedience
[1:08:21] amen amen
[1:08:23] you wouldn't know that there's light if
[1:08:25] there was nothing but darkness
[1:08:27] darts and saint darkness if that's all
[1:08:29] there is
[1:08:31] light's not light unless that's all
[1:08:33] there is is light you understand right
[1:08:36] so there is no
[1:08:37] there is no disobedience if there's oh
[1:08:40] if there's no obedience
[1:08:42] because everybody's just all the same
[1:08:44] but because we know there's that spirit
[1:08:47] that still works in the children of
[1:08:48] disobedience there is a spirit that
[1:08:52] works in the children of obedience
[1:08:54] and it's not the spirit of the devil
[1:08:56] it's the spirit of christ
[1:08:58] and his word who has made us alive
[1:09:01] quickened us
[1:09:02] to him among whom also
[1:09:05] we all had our conversation and time
[1:09:07] passed and the lust of our flesh and
[1:09:09] don't deny you know we all did
[1:09:12] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:09:15] of the mind and were by nature
[1:09:18] the children of wrath even as others our
[1:09:20] very nature commanded us to lie still
[1:09:22] cheat that's just how we were born
[1:09:24] that's who we were that's how we lived
[1:09:26] our lives our very nature we just did
[1:09:29] what we were born to do right
[1:09:32] as we were born amen amen
[1:09:34] natural brute beasts
[1:09:37] fourth verse but god who is rich in
[1:09:40] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:09:43] loved us
[1:09:44] even when we were dead in sins
[1:09:47] hath quickened us together with christ
[1:09:51] by grace are you saved now look at this
[1:09:54] even when we were that is past tense
[1:09:58] amen which means you're no longer dead
[1:10:00] you're alive why you've been quickened
[1:10:02] right
[1:10:02] you were dead where in sin
[1:10:06] right so what is sin sin is death
[1:10:09] when you are living in sin
[1:10:12] the people the world that live in sin
[1:10:14] are living in death
[1:10:16] when we were living we were dead in our
[1:10:19] sins
[1:10:21] now we are dead to sin right amen
[1:10:25] once we were dead in sin
[1:10:28] now we are dead to sin sin has no hall
[1:10:32] over us anymore very much sin has no
[1:10:34] right to us anymore yes sin has no uh of
[1:10:38] prevalence over us anymore yes we're
[1:10:41] dead to it
[1:10:42] sin is dead to us
[1:10:44] a child of god does not sin
[1:10:48] understand
[1:10:49] a child of god a
[1:10:51] born again holy ghost filled child of
[1:10:54] god
[1:10:54] does not sin amen
[1:10:57] you say how do you say that brother
[1:10:59] newton first john chapter 3
[1:11:01] he that is born of the seed of god
[1:11:04] cannot sin
[1:11:06] for that seed remaineth in him yes
[1:11:09] you're no longer in sin
[1:11:11] you're dead to sin
[1:11:13] sin is death sin has no grip on you
[1:11:16] anymore amen sin has no hold on you
[1:11:19] anymore why because you have been born
[1:11:22] again anew of the holy spirit of god has
[1:11:24] made you a new creature and you no
[1:11:26] longer live the same life that you lose
[1:11:28] you used to
[1:11:30] you no longer live by the dictates of
[1:11:32] your mind the pleasures of your flesh
[1:11:35] right you live by the dictates of the
[1:11:37] word of god amen and by the moving of
[1:11:39] his holy spirit in your life thus you
[1:11:42] are dead to sin
[1:11:45] that nature has been changed yes
[1:11:49] you no longer live by nature as the
[1:11:51] children of wrath your nature now is god
[1:11:56] that's your nature
[1:11:58] and if god is your nature then how can
[1:12:00] that sin
[1:12:02] it can't sin
[1:12:04] now your flesh might slip up and make
[1:12:06] mistakes and do things it shouldn't do
[1:12:08] of course we know that
[1:12:10] but those are just superficial things
[1:12:12] that uh that that this flesh is past how
[1:12:15] still we have to put up with
[1:12:17] that's why we come before the lord say
[1:12:19] god forgive my sin but in your heart in
[1:12:22] your soul
[1:12:24] where god is where you really are
[1:12:26] right there is no sin amen cannot be sin
[1:12:30] amen cannot be
[1:12:34] sin even when we were dead in sins
[1:12:38] he quickened us together
[1:12:41] with christ
[1:12:42] now focus on that just a moment as we
[1:12:44] get to this the sixth verse is wrong the
[1:12:46] sixth verse is where i want to end he
[1:12:50] had quickened us
[1:12:52] made us alive together
[1:12:56] with christ
[1:12:58] amen with christ
[1:13:02] and hath raised us up together
[1:13:05] and made us sit together
[1:13:07] in heavenly places
[1:13:10] in christ jesus
[1:13:13] now won't you notice this three times
[1:13:17] three times paul puts in ephesians he
[1:13:20] has quickened us together with christ
[1:13:23] he has raised us up together and made us
[1:13:27] sin together in christ
[1:13:31] so we're together in christ
[1:13:34] we're together with one another
[1:13:37] and we're with one another in christ
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:43] so we've been quickened
[1:13:45] we've been made alive
[1:13:47] we have been
[1:13:48] raised up
[1:13:50] caught up
[1:13:52] enraptured
[1:13:54] we've been enraptured in heavenly places
[1:13:58] in christ jesus
[1:14:00] if you're born again god has raised you
[1:14:03] up to that place to live in christ jesus
[1:14:06] a dimension a place that's higher than
[1:14:08] this dimension that we live in here yes
[1:14:11] it's better than this dimension that
[1:14:13] that our that our bodies are caught in
[1:14:16] no wonder brother brown said i'm so glad
[1:14:18] there's a device to get me out of this
[1:14:21] past house
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] because that's where this man lives you
[1:14:25] know brother branham said that god has
[1:14:27] him live so high
[1:14:30] that everything remember brother green
[1:14:32] used to say this yes yes
[1:14:34] brother branham's god has me lived so
[1:14:36] high
[1:14:38] now where was brother branham she's
[1:14:40] right here he said if he came in and
[1:14:42] preached he was still alive and he came
[1:14:44] in priest for us he'd be standing behind
[1:14:45] this pulpit just like i am right he's
[1:14:48] listening to me he'd be sitting right
[1:14:49] there on that seat just like you all are
[1:14:51] right now yeah amen
[1:14:53] yes you would but god had him live so
[1:14:56] high
[1:14:57] that everything that we did in the sight
[1:14:59] of god was sin right
[1:15:02] yeah by the flesh
[1:15:04] of course you know by the flesh not by
[1:15:06] the spirit not by the life that's in us
[1:15:08] by the flesh so there's that being
[1:15:11] caught up that place of enrapture
[1:15:15] that place that god has for us in
[1:15:17] heavenly places in christ jesus so these
[1:15:21] bodies are creatures of the world friend
[1:15:23] but we aren't right amen we have been
[1:15:26] caught up together with christ with one
[1:15:29] another and with one another in christ
[1:15:33] praise the lord what is it now then
[1:15:36] so
[1:15:38] first thessalonians 4
[1:15:41] gives us a preview of the physical
[1:15:44] rapture
[1:15:46] but ephesians 2 6 gives us the vision of
[1:15:49] a spiritual rapture of being spiritually
[1:15:53] raptured
[1:15:55] i mean i'm getting ahead of myself a
[1:15:57] little bit and i'll come back to it but
[1:15:59] where do you think enoch lived before
[1:16:01] god took him right
[1:16:03] where do you think he lived amen
[1:16:06] he didn't just live
[1:16:08] in
[1:16:09] in the flesh all the time he didn't just
[1:16:12] live
[1:16:12] his body was caught here
[1:16:16] but brother branham makes this reference
[1:16:19] he said
[1:16:20] enoch had got to where he lived so close
[1:16:24] to god
[1:16:25] that god said enoch you're closer to my
[1:16:28] home than you are down there so just
[1:16:30] come on up
[1:16:34] he was already in rapture yes he was
[1:16:36] already well he didn't have the holy
[1:16:38] ghost but he had god
[1:16:40] who do you think the holy ghost is amen
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:44] he's he's god christ the word the holy
[1:16:48] spirit he's all the same amen he doesn't
[1:16:50] change he's the same amen the different
[1:16:54] one of these things play different parts
[1:16:56] but they're all one he's god amen but he
[1:16:59] was
[1:17:00] enraptured where do you think brother
[1:17:02] branham was when he was sitting there on
[1:17:04] his bed and he had his hands behind his
[1:17:06] head
[1:17:07] and god lifted him up from his body to
[1:17:10] where he could actually look down and
[1:17:12] see his body sitting on the bed
[1:17:15] or was he
[1:17:17] he was enraptured yes where do you think
[1:17:20] paul was when god said he took and
[1:17:22] caught me up to the third heavens where
[1:17:25] do you think he was amen amen look
[1:17:27] friend these aren't things that's just
[1:17:29] uh
[1:17:30] a figments of imagination or allegories
[1:17:33] this is this is truth
[1:17:35] this is fact this is where god's
[1:17:38] children live this is where we are in a
[1:17:40] state a perpetual state of of
[1:17:44] enrapturement
[1:17:46] and perpetual just means continual right
[1:17:50] it means that you're always there
[1:17:52] there's never a time of
[1:17:55] of being any different okay that's what
[1:17:58] perpetual means it is always right there
[1:18:02] that there's never a one second of being
[1:18:05] any place else or in any other condition
[1:18:09] it's a perpetual state of enrapturement
[1:18:12] where do you think paul went where do
[1:18:14] you think brother branham went thank god
[1:18:16] brother adam came back and told us what
[1:18:18] he saw
[1:18:19] god took him there
[1:18:21] saw his daughter saw his wife saw his
[1:18:23] horse saw his chair
[1:18:25] saw the things the the wonderful place
[1:18:27] and the testimony that we have that
[1:18:29] we're going to when this pest house
[1:18:32] relieves itself of us
[1:18:34] we're going there
[1:18:36] praise the lord and i'm looking forward
[1:18:37] to that friend why would we even want to
[1:18:39] think about being a coward to come
[1:18:41] kicking and screaming lord take me
[1:18:44] even so lord come quickly
[1:18:47] praise the lord
[1:18:48] but it's a perpetual state of
[1:18:50] enrapturement
[1:18:52] that that state of enragement a
[1:18:54] spiritual rapture that we live in all
[1:18:57] the time
[1:18:59] the changing of this body is the only
[1:19:02] element left right
[1:19:05] for the bride
[1:19:08] the only element left
[1:19:10] of her going in this
[1:19:12] first thessalonians 4 event rapture
[1:19:17] is the changing of these bodies
[1:19:20] that's the only thing left
[1:19:22] that's all that that's all that's left
[1:19:24] to be accomplished is for this body to
[1:19:27] change
[1:19:29] romans 8
[1:19:32] to win the changing of these bodies
[1:19:35] that's all we're looking for the change
[1:19:37] in this is the only thing that keeps me
[1:19:38] this past house is the only thing that
[1:19:40] keeps us here
[1:19:41] otherwise friend we live we should be
[1:19:45] living in a state of enrapturement
[1:19:48] a state of being caught up a state of
[1:19:51] perpetually living
[1:19:53] in heavenly places living in christ
[1:19:57] jesus continually perpetually our entire
[1:20:01] lives
[1:20:02] that's why you see things differently
[1:20:05] that's why you talk differently that's
[1:20:08] why you act and dress differently
[1:20:10] because you're not a creature of this
[1:20:12] planet
[1:20:14] you have been caught up and enraptured
[1:20:17] till your very thinking has been changed
[1:20:21] to the to the thinking of god's word
[1:20:25] and you can't help but act that way
[1:20:28] you can't help but
[1:20:29] but be the person you are because you're
[1:20:31] caught up into that's who you are you're
[1:20:33] in that place you're living in that
[1:20:35] place
[1:20:37] you ever heard of assimilation of course
[1:20:39] this country doesn't think anybody needs
[1:20:41] to assimilate anymore but you've heard
[1:20:43] of assimilation
[1:20:44] where uh
[1:20:46] when in rome right it's not what they
[1:20:48] say when in rome do as the romans do
[1:20:50] that's i guess a cliche that's been for
[1:20:53] years since i've known when in rome do
[1:20:55] as the romans what does that mean that
[1:20:56] it means you assimilate
[1:20:59] you you if you go to rome then you
[1:21:01] should speak italian
[1:21:04] uh you you should be used to eating
[1:21:06] pasta and garlic bread and and and
[1:21:10] and all the cuisine and and everything
[1:21:12] that uh
[1:21:13] italians do and how they live
[1:21:16] nothing probably bugs my wife more than
[1:21:18] people coming here and uh and
[1:21:20] specifically for mexico but i guess
[1:21:22] coming from anywhere and try to come and
[1:21:24] and want to be this their country and i
[1:21:27] don't blame them best country in the
[1:21:29] world as bad as it is best country on
[1:21:31] the planet
[1:21:33] i don't blame them for wanting to come
[1:21:34] here but if you're going to come here
[1:21:36] learn english
[1:21:40] speak the language assimilate
[1:21:43] if you really want to then then do it
[1:21:46] and but my point of that is that
[1:21:49] that's
[1:21:50] what we do
[1:21:52] when you're enraptured and you're caught
[1:21:55] up
[1:21:56] you assimilate to where you're at your
[1:22:00] surroundings well your surroundings are
[1:22:02] heavenly places now amen if you're
[1:22:05] caught up if you're raptured
[1:22:08] spiritually raptured you're living in
[1:22:10] heavenly places so what do you do you
[1:22:12] assimilate yourself to the environment
[1:22:15] that you're living in
[1:22:18] sometimes even in your own body your
[1:22:20] language might change amen to a heavenly
[1:22:23] language that you don't know anything
[1:22:24] about
[1:22:26] you may not know how to speak it
[1:22:28] you can't go to the school and try to
[1:22:30] learn it
[1:22:31] there's not a babel or whatever that you
[1:22:33] can find an app on your phone that'll
[1:22:35] teach you how to speak that now there's
[1:22:38] there's uh there there's religious
[1:22:41] schools out there that'll try to teach
[1:22:43] you how to speak in tongues
[1:22:46] get your tongue all tangled up that's
[1:22:48] not speaking in tongues friend that's
[1:22:49] not men or angel amen that's just
[1:22:52] ungodly
[1:22:54] but it's not scriptural man anyway
[1:22:57] but your language might even change when
[1:22:59] you get enraptured
[1:23:01] your thought process changes the way you
[1:23:04] live your life changes the way you think
[1:23:06] about and view things changes
[1:23:10] people look out of the world today and
[1:23:12] they think oh there's nothing wrong with
[1:23:13] having 15 holes in my head
[1:23:16] you know 13 on each ear or
[1:23:18] eyebrows and all over and nose and you
[1:23:21] know when i was growing up we went to a
[1:23:22] place last night and you know girl had
[1:23:25] one sticking out of her nose and i said
[1:23:27] i don't mean i'm not making fun but i
[1:23:29] said the only when i was growing up the
[1:23:31] only place you saw one of those was it a
[1:23:33] heifer cow
[1:23:35] hanging out that's the only place i ever
[1:23:37] saw when i was a kid but anyway
[1:23:40] it doesn't mean that way anymore
[1:23:42] you know they can they can have one arm
[1:23:44] so colored up that you have no clue what
[1:23:46] the tattoo even says or both arms or
[1:23:49] whatever it up their necks and on their
[1:23:51] heads and all around i don't think
[1:23:53] anything about that and the world looks
[1:23:55] at it says oh what's wrong with that
[1:23:57] other
[1:23:59] nominal churches oh there's nothing
[1:24:00] wrong with that sure yeah you go right
[1:24:03] ahead
[1:24:04] you look at it you think how is that a
[1:24:06] heavenly place right amen how is
[1:24:09] scarring what's supposed to be the
[1:24:11] temple of the holy ghost
[1:24:13] living in a heavenly place but see they
[1:24:16] don't see anything wrong with that the
[1:24:18] world doesn't see anything wrong with it
[1:24:20] the world doesn't see anything wrong
[1:24:22] with
[1:24:23] with how they live
[1:24:24] and how they act and the things that
[1:24:26] they do
[1:24:27] it's become so prevalent now with
[1:24:30] with alcohol even they don't see
[1:24:32] anything or i would just drink a little
[1:24:33] of wine you know or
[1:24:35] before you know it you got a little wine
[1:24:37] going into a lot of wine going into a
[1:24:38] bottle or two a day
[1:24:40] amen a beer here beer there it's no big
[1:24:43] deal they don't see anything wrong with
[1:24:44] that
[1:24:46] but when you're living in heavenly
[1:24:47] places your viewpoint changes right
[1:24:52] when you look down upon the things
[1:24:54] that's of the world it's
[1:24:56] filth it's ungodly
[1:25:00] because you're in a different place
[1:25:01] you're in a different dimension you've
[1:25:03] assimilated to heavenly places so
[1:25:05] everything else around is just filth
[1:25:08] right
[1:25:09] the world looks at it and says oh that
[1:25:11] looks fine
[1:25:12] girl come out of a dressing room had got
[1:25:15] you know a
[1:25:17] teeth floss on their bodies oh that
[1:25:19] looks great you look
[1:25:21] uh wonderful
[1:25:23] dressed in floss really
[1:25:26] but see when you're in heavenly places
[1:25:28] you look at it you look and that's filth
[1:25:31] the world looks at it because they've
[1:25:32] assimilated to what's around them oh
[1:25:34] that's beard you're beautiful yeah
[1:25:36] that's
[1:25:36] what's the word they use hot you're hot
[1:25:40] that's the way the world looks at it you
[1:25:42] look at it a different way because
[1:25:43] you've been enraptured you're in a
[1:25:45] different place oh you're just
[1:25:46] old-fashioned no i'm just a godly holy
[1:25:48] ghost-filled christian amen
[1:25:51] and if that means being old-fashioned
[1:25:53] then yes i am label me all you want i
[1:25:55] don't have a problem you're not going to
[1:25:57] cancel me
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] i'm going to be who i am regardless of
[1:26:02] what this canceled culture wants to do
[1:26:04] because the truth is the truth
[1:26:06] you believe it or not you need to go to
[1:26:08] hell or heaven it's your choice that's
[1:26:10] right amen amen i've
[1:26:13] seen advertisements lately now people
[1:26:15] are saying heaven or not
[1:26:17] is it really
[1:26:18] you can't say heaven or hell
[1:26:21] because that's what it's about right
[1:26:23] heaven or not what is it we're not
[1:26:26] it's hell right but you're by my point
[1:26:28] see you're living in heavenly places
[1:26:31] enraptured now together now what are we
[1:26:33] together what binds us saints
[1:26:36] what binds us what brings us together
[1:26:40] is it our church
[1:26:42] a lot of people want you to think it is
[1:26:44] oh it's it's my church
[1:26:48] this person came to my church
[1:26:51] is is and a lot of people go because
[1:26:53] that's my church
[1:26:56] that's what binds a lot of people
[1:26:59] the familiarity
[1:27:01] it's just a domination spirit it's what
[1:27:02] it is but a lot of people believe that
[1:27:04] way
[1:27:05] oh it's my church see it's church that
[1:27:08] brings us together
[1:27:10] is it doctrine a lot of people think
[1:27:12] doctrine is what brings people oh you've
[1:27:14] got to go hear him and the doctrine he
[1:27:16] preaches what not is
[1:27:18] his doctor what brings us together
[1:27:22] doctrine doesn't bring us together in
[1:27:24] fact a lot of times it's the doctrine is
[1:27:26] what separates us yeah right too many
[1:27:29] times the the attitude the pride and the
[1:27:33] the
[1:27:33] the arrogance that and the doctrines
[1:27:36] what separated well i'm right you're
[1:27:38] wrong
[1:27:39] well that might be but can't we be
[1:27:40] brothers right amen amen amen pray for
[1:27:44] us again next saturday we have another
[1:27:45] ministers meeting by the way it just
[1:27:47] came to my mind
[1:27:48] can't we still be brothers
[1:27:50] next saturday in phoenix we have another
[1:27:52] minister's meeting we come together as
[1:27:54] brothers that's the whole thing
[1:27:56] there's probably people there i've heard
[1:27:58] people speak i've heard different things
[1:28:00] being said that i don't particularly
[1:28:01] agree with but that's my brother i don't
[1:28:03] care right it's not that's not my
[1:28:05] separating dividing point amen what
[1:28:08] brings us together
[1:28:10] what is it that binds the bride because
[1:28:13] look friend there's going to be an
[1:28:15] international rapture this rapture is
[1:28:17] going to be all kindred's tongue people
[1:28:20] nation all around the world
[1:28:23] well there's people in the rapture
[1:28:25] 99.5
[1:28:28] i've never even met
[1:28:30] how can i know what binds me to that
[1:28:32] brother over in marisha
[1:28:35] how do i know that binds me to that to
[1:28:37] that brother that may have just given
[1:28:39] his life in afghanistan by the way
[1:28:42] pray for them
[1:28:45] i got some bad news this week the
[1:28:47] underground church they had there in
[1:28:48] afghanistan the taliban finally tracked
[1:28:51] them down and gunned them all down
[1:28:53] killed the whole church
[1:28:54] everyone did
[1:28:56] somebody was actually on the phone
[1:28:59] into the united states when it happened
[1:29:02] they said they they said we had some
[1:29:04] boldness come on us and and uh the lord
[1:29:07] really blessed them and then all of a
[1:29:08] sudden the gun shots rang out and just
[1:29:10] slaughtered the whole underground church
[1:29:12] killed them all
[1:29:13] so
[1:29:15] anyway i was going to say something but
[1:29:17] i'm not going to but
[1:29:19] this this bride is international
[1:29:22] so if it's international i don't know
[1:29:24] what is it that binds us there's there
[1:29:26] can only be one thing that binds us
[1:29:27] together it's not our doctrine it's not
[1:29:29] the church you go to it's not the city
[1:29:31] you live in it's not cause you believe
[1:29:32] this message you know brother branham
[1:29:35] i mean that's not what binds us together
[1:29:37] because how many people you know that
[1:29:38] are in this message and still have
[1:29:40] differing opinions about what brother
[1:29:41] madam said right of course most of the
[1:29:43] time it's what brother branham meant
[1:29:45] i'm not a real big fan of what brother
[1:29:47] graham meant but
[1:29:48] what did he say
[1:29:50] but see what binds us together
[1:29:53] there can only be one thing
[1:29:56] god will only meet the worshiper
[1:29:59] under the shed blood of the innocent
[1:30:01] lamb amen that's the only place god
[1:30:03] meets the worshiper yes only place
[1:30:08] let me read you this quote
[1:30:10] in god's chosen place of worship
[1:30:13] february 1965
[1:30:16] he said now being that there is 900 and
[1:30:18] something questions about where god
[1:30:20] meets he meets with the methodist or he
[1:30:23] meets with the baptist he meets with
[1:30:26] this he meets with that in the other
[1:30:28] now there's a question there
[1:30:30] so any so everyone has to seek out his
[1:30:33] own salvation with fear and trembling
[1:30:36] that is true
[1:30:37] everybody
[1:30:39] everyone you all have to have to uh work
[1:30:43] out your own salvation but you do it
[1:30:46] with fear and trembling amen amen so
[1:30:48] somebody comes living some ungodly life
[1:30:51] and says well i gotta work out my own
[1:30:52] salvation and say well yeah but the
[1:30:54] bible says you better do it with fear
[1:30:55] and trembling amen yes amen there's a
[1:30:57] big difference in just working it out
[1:30:59] and working it out with fear and
[1:31:00] trembling amen amen
[1:31:03] with fear and trembling but tonight i
[1:31:05] want to find and prove in the scripture
[1:31:08] where the correct place is where god
[1:31:10] meets and worships with the people
[1:31:14] and if it's and if that's it that's the
[1:31:17] only place
[1:31:18] the only place that he will ever meet us
[1:31:23] amen and as you know probably he goes on
[1:31:26] to talk about the only place god needs
[1:31:28] meets the worshiper is under that shed
[1:31:30] blood yes the shed blood of the innocent
[1:31:33] lamb is the only place that god will
[1:31:35] meet the worshiper that's what binds us
[1:31:37] together when the word talks about us
[1:31:40] coming together we come together in
[1:31:42] heavenly places we come together with
[1:31:45] christ we come together
[1:31:48] with one another with christ very much
[1:31:51] and that together binds us is that
[1:31:54] is that worship that that place that
[1:31:57] heavenly place of being under the shed
[1:32:00] blood of jesus christ amen that's what
[1:32:02] binds this bride together that's what
[1:32:04] brings her together amen
[1:32:07] that's what solidifies that bride
[1:32:10] as she sits in those heavenly places
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:13] just a moment
[1:32:15] can i read a couple more scripture jude
[1:32:18] let's go to the book of jude there is no
[1:32:20] chapter but verse 14.
[1:32:26] jude is just one chapter
[1:32:29] jude 14.
[1:32:32] now we see that
[1:32:35] we know
[1:32:36] that
[1:32:38] enoch
[1:32:39] types
[1:32:40] the bride
[1:32:41] the gentile bride enoch hides the
[1:32:44] gentile bride
[1:32:47] in rapturing yes in in a literal rapture
[1:32:51] but also
[1:32:52] in that enoch as we read here let's read
[1:32:55] the 14th verse and enoch also the
[1:32:58] seventh from adam
[1:33:00] prophesied of these things saying behold
[1:33:02] the lord cometh with ten thousands of
[1:33:04] his saints
[1:33:06] adam enoch being seventh the seventh
[1:33:08] from adam is the type of the bride being
[1:33:12] in the seventh church age that takes the
[1:33:15] rapture now there's bride all through
[1:33:17] every church age right amen but the
[1:33:20] actual event of rapture the physical
[1:33:24] rapture changing of our bodies takes
[1:33:26] place at the end of the seventh church
[1:33:29] age
[1:33:30] amen now the seventh church age
[1:33:32] continues on after the rapture but it's
[1:33:34] right at the end there's three and a
[1:33:36] half years of tribulation and so forth
[1:33:38] but we know that that in rapture
[1:33:41] literal rapture physical rapture body
[1:33:44] change takes place at the seventh church
[1:33:46] age so not only
[1:33:48] does does jude
[1:33:51] vindicate the serpent seed
[1:33:54] by nullifying cain as abel's son
[1:33:57] amen because if you put cain in adam's
[1:34:00] lineage that makes enoch 8 from adam not
[1:34:04] seven
[1:34:05] the only way you can make enoch the
[1:34:07] seventh from adam is to alleviate cain
[1:34:10] hallelujah
[1:34:11] because cain was of that wicked one
[1:34:14] right cain was the serpent seen not the
[1:34:16] son of adam amen so in adam adam's
[1:34:20] lineage
[1:34:21] enoch was the seventh from adam as that
[1:34:24] type
[1:34:25] of
[1:34:26] the seventh church age
[1:34:28] taking the rapture right the time that
[1:34:30] we're living now that type of that
[1:34:32] seventh church age is the rapture time
[1:34:35] amen the physical changing body rapture
[1:34:39] time that's where we're living
[1:34:41] we're living at that time the at the end
[1:34:44] can i say of laodicea church age we're
[1:34:47] living at the closing scenes of the
[1:34:49] laodicean church age yes it's got a
[1:34:51] little bit more to go of course like i
[1:34:52] said even after the rapture there'll be
[1:34:54] a little bit more now
[1:34:56] if
[1:34:57] if enoch was in rapture translated
[1:35:01] let's look at
[1:35:03] a couple other scriptures
[1:35:06] you don't have to turn here but in
[1:35:07] genesis chapter 5
[1:35:10] verse 24
[1:35:11] it says enoch walked with god
[1:35:15] and he was not for god took him right
[1:35:18] so what was enoch doing before god took
[1:35:21] him
[1:35:22] he was walking with god
[1:35:25] amen that's pretty simple it's not a lot
[1:35:28] that describes it not a whole lot that
[1:35:30] goes into it even though june jude said
[1:35:33] that enoch prophesied
[1:35:36] did you notice here for enoch also the
[1:35:38] seventh from adam prophesied of these
[1:35:40] things his rapturing his translating his
[1:35:45] going away prophesy
[1:35:48] of what was going to happen in the
[1:35:50] seventh church
[1:35:52] amen
[1:35:53] he walked with god
[1:35:54] as he walked with god god took him amen
[1:35:57] hebrews
[1:35:59] hebrews chapter 11
[1:36:01] by faith enoch was translated
[1:36:04] amen
[1:36:05] that he should not see death and was not
[1:36:08] found
[1:36:09] because god had translated him but
[1:36:12] before his translation he had this
[1:36:15] testimony that he pleased god
[1:36:19] so
[1:36:20] the focus i want to make on this
[1:36:21] scripture just like the previous one
[1:36:25] is what was going on
[1:36:28] at the moment
[1:36:30] enoch was translated
[1:36:32] what was he doing
[1:36:34] what was his life like
[1:36:36] how was he acting
[1:36:38] where was he at
[1:36:40] it's spiritually
[1:36:42] well it tells us
[1:36:44] genesis said he walked with god
[1:36:46] hebrews said
[1:36:48] he had a testimony
[1:36:51] that he pleased god
[1:36:53] before he was translated
[1:36:57] he had this
[1:36:58] testimony that he pleased god amen
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:04] that's pretty simple and when you break
[1:37:06] all down to it you come filter all
[1:37:09] through the denominations go through all
[1:37:11] the messages message churches you go you
[1:37:13] go fill to filter through all these
[1:37:16] things and
[1:37:17] it really boils down to the fact that
[1:37:19] are we is my life pleasing to the lord
[1:37:21] yes
[1:37:22] that's really what it boils down to amen
[1:37:24] and i believe that's why at the end of
[1:37:26] the seventh church age that brother
[1:37:27] branham said just live a good holy uh
[1:37:30] godly holy ghost christian life yes
[1:37:33] be the best christian you can be amen
[1:37:36] amen
[1:37:38] be pleasing to the lord
[1:37:40] that's the whole point now obviously
[1:37:42] without the holy ghost and obedience in
[1:37:44] his word you can't be pleasing to god
[1:37:47] because obedience is better than
[1:37:48] sacrifice amen we the only way to be
[1:37:51] pleasing to the lord is to be obedient
[1:37:53] to him and you can't be obedient to him
[1:37:55] unless you end the word filled with the
[1:37:57] holy spirit yeah amen which are the same
[1:38:00] but when you're in that capacity of the
[1:38:03] lord
[1:38:04] then
[1:38:06] when you're living in a heavenly place
[1:38:09] you're living in the atmospheres of
[1:38:11] where god dwells
[1:38:13] and your whole assimilation to that
[1:38:16] atmosphere
[1:38:17] is
[1:38:18] scriptural and godly
[1:38:21] how could you keep but from pleasing god
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:25] how could you keep but from walking with
[1:38:28] god
[1:38:29] your whole vision has changed
[1:38:31] your whole perspective in life the way
[1:38:34] you think the way you see things like i
[1:38:36] said earlier
[1:38:37] it's different than the world of course
[1:38:39] they see and they don't you know all the
[1:38:40] ungodly things they don't see any
[1:38:42] problem with it you look at it you say
[1:38:44] my that looks horrible why would
[1:38:45] somebody look like that why would they
[1:38:47] do that to their bodies why would they
[1:38:48] wear that why do people go to this place
[1:38:51] why would people watch this
[1:38:53] this shouldn't even exist because people
[1:38:56] it wouldn't exist if people didn't watch
[1:38:58] it
[1:38:58] right
[1:39:00] a place wouldn't exist if people didn't
[1:39:02] go there if nobody went there it would
[1:39:04] close
[1:39:05] they would shut it off they would stop
[1:39:08] it
[1:39:08] so there's got to be multitudes of
[1:39:10] people doing it i think why
[1:39:13] well i say why because i'm living in a
[1:39:17] total different place
[1:39:19] i'm enraptured friend and the way i see
[1:39:22] it is so different than the way
[1:39:23] everybody else sees it
[1:39:25] well how's the way you see it is the way
[1:39:27] god sees it right amen
[1:39:29] and the way god sees it then
[1:39:31] then when you're living with that might
[1:39:33] of god let the mind of christ be in you
[1:39:36] that you you live in a place that that
[1:39:38] you're going to be pleasing to the lord
[1:39:41] you can't help but walk with god when
[1:39:44] you're in that dimension
[1:39:47] you can't help but please god when
[1:39:49] you're living in that place you can't
[1:39:51] help it
[1:39:52] because it's just who you are
[1:39:55] you know when the lord gave me that
[1:39:56] revelation about that i never realized
[1:39:58] to what degree would unfold itself in my
[1:40:01] ministry but it really has become about
[1:40:03] almost everything
[1:40:05] i am who i am because that's what god
[1:40:07] made me and he made me that way to be
[1:40:10] pleasing to him so everything i do i do
[1:40:13] to be pleasing to him is just because
[1:40:15] it's who i am
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:18] i can't see it any other way
[1:40:20] i can't live it any other way
[1:40:23] i have absolutely no desire to go back
[1:40:26] in the world and live the way i used to
[1:40:28] none
[1:40:30] it's disgusting filth to me
[1:40:33] it's like saying hey newton there's a
[1:40:36] there's six foot of flowing sewage down
[1:40:38] underneath this street why don't you hop
[1:40:40] in the manhole oh yeah sure why don't we
[1:40:43] do that go for a swim
[1:40:46] i have no interest
[1:40:49] in diving into six foot of sewage
[1:40:53] and i have no desire to dive into the
[1:40:57] world
[1:40:58] again which is worse than the sewage
[1:41:01] because we live in a different place
[1:41:04] pleasing to god the testimony
[1:41:07] that we're pleasing to god that's why
[1:41:09] god would say enter into the joys of the
[1:41:11] lord you've been faithful
[1:41:13] amen because that's the place that god
[1:41:16] has you live your testimony is pleasing
[1:41:19] to the lord
[1:41:22] one more think about this
[1:41:24] philip
[1:41:26] when philip met the
[1:41:28] eunuch now this has happened of course
[1:41:30] other places and times and uh we don't
[1:41:33] know them all or
[1:41:36] all the events that this may have
[1:41:38] happened but you know when philip met
[1:41:39] the eunuch
[1:41:42] philip
[1:41:43] after he baptized the eunuch was gone
[1:41:46] he was translated
[1:41:49] just like enoch was translated
[1:41:51] what translated to mean is just took
[1:41:54] taken away
[1:41:55] or taken from one place to another
[1:41:58] amen now we believe that enoch
[1:42:01] was taken from this earth to not see
[1:42:03] death
[1:42:04] philip was translated and all of a
[1:42:06] sudden he was found in some other whole
[1:42:08] another city
[1:42:10] i mean
[1:42:11] as soon as they as soon as the eunuch
[1:42:13] the bible says came up from being
[1:42:15] baptized he opened his eyes and looked
[1:42:17] and philip was gone
[1:42:19] right
[1:42:20] and philip shows up in a whole other
[1:42:22] city somewhere
[1:42:24] because god translated the bible says
[1:42:26] god took him away
[1:42:29] which is the same
[1:42:31] greek word
[1:42:32] as
[1:42:33] the caught up in 1st thessalonians 4.
[1:42:37] amen the same greek word
[1:42:39] caught up
[1:42:40] he was removed from one place over to
[1:42:43] another now philip had a job to finish
[1:42:46] whatever it was
[1:42:47] that god had him do
[1:42:49] scripturally we could read but whatever
[1:42:52] god god philip had another job and god
[1:42:54] had to have him over here so god just
[1:42:56] took him and plucked him and put him
[1:42:57] over here
[1:42:58] he was translated
[1:43:00] enoch was translated now the bible says
[1:43:02] that enoch lived 365 years brother
[1:43:05] graham says many places 500.
[1:43:07] now was there a rounding up was there a
[1:43:09] rounding down i don't know
[1:43:11] i i don't concern myself with those
[1:43:13] things it doesn't it doesn't involve uh
[1:43:16] my salvation my salvation is not based
[1:43:18] on whether you're not going to hear 500
[1:43:20] or 365. but could he have been
[1:43:24] translated
[1:43:26] there's no record scripturally that we
[1:43:28] know he showed up any other place like
[1:43:30] we do philip
[1:43:31] we don't know all we know is he is
[1:43:33] translated and he was not because god
[1:43:36] took
[1:43:36] him philip was found in a different city
[1:43:40] because he was translated where do you
[1:43:42] think philip was living
[1:43:43] where do you think brother branham was
[1:43:45] living where do you think paul was
[1:43:47] living
[1:43:48] what do you think it means that let me
[1:43:50] read this
[1:43:52] where we're supposed to live in this
[1:43:54] last day where god wants us
[1:44:03] revelation 4 1.
[1:44:05] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:44:08] was open and remember this after the
[1:44:09] bride's gone bride goes up in revelation
[1:44:12] 3.
[1:44:14] and this i looked and behold a door was
[1:44:15] open in heaven and the first voice which
[1:44:18] i heard was uh was as it were of a
[1:44:20] trumpet talking with me which said come
[1:44:23] up hither and i will show you these
[1:44:24] things which must be hereafter where do
[1:44:26] you think john was going
[1:44:29] when when when that voice spoke to him
[1:44:32] and said come up hither where
[1:44:36] do i get a space rocket
[1:44:39] i hope
[1:44:40] i'm being silly but you understand the
[1:44:42] point right
[1:44:44] john was standing right there when he
[1:44:46] was caught up when god took him to a
[1:44:49] place to where he had greater vision
[1:44:52] spiritual vision
[1:44:54] amen not not natural human vision
[1:44:58] i mean you couldn't boil the holy ghost
[1:44:59] out of the man so uh in nevada oil so
[1:45:03] uh so but when he was caught up
[1:45:07] he was caught up to a place that god
[1:45:08] could show him something right god had
[1:45:11] to take his spirit
[1:45:12] himself out just like brother branham
[1:45:14] could look down and see his body
[1:45:16] but he did he couldn't do it down there
[1:45:18] he had to bring him up
[1:45:21] to a place that there was greater vision
[1:45:25] and that's where god wants us to live
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:28] if we don't get anything today friend
[1:45:30] that's what god that's where god wants
[1:45:32] us to live
[1:45:33] we should be as holy ghosts feel godly
[1:45:36] christians the children of god we should
[1:45:39] be living in that place where god will
[1:45:42] we walk with god are pleasing to the
[1:45:45] lord and have a testimony that we are
[1:45:47] pleasing to god
[1:45:49] in rapture
[1:45:50] perpetually in rapture so when the body
[1:45:53] change takes place why is just a change
[1:45:56] of venue
[1:45:58] just you know we read last week program
[1:46:00] said that ufo you see that we call them
[1:46:02] ifos

[1:46:06] said they're gonna pick you up one of
[1:46:07] these days little children don't be
[1:46:09] afraid don't worry about it you see the
[1:46:11] increase in activity saints we talked
[1:46:13] about last week amen
[1:46:16] no doubt there's probably been more of
[1:46:18] it because there's more cameras around
[1:46:19] people taking pictures but a lot of the
[1:46:22] sightings nowadays have been from like
[1:46:24] military
[1:46:25] ships aircraft battleships stuff like
[1:46:27] that have been videoing these
[1:46:29] these events taking place and watching
[1:46:31] these things streak across the sky
[1:46:34] at speeds humans know nothing about
[1:46:37] and the pentagon says well
[1:46:40] area 51. everybody's
[1:46:43] they they all talk about this great
[1:46:44] conspiracy well we you know we we we we
[1:46:50] it
[1:46:51] and they don't know right
[1:46:53] they have no idea
[1:46:55] they want to pretend like they know
[1:46:56] because they're proud
[1:46:59] we're we're the smartest people ever to
[1:47:01] live on the planet
[1:47:04] and they don't have don't know how to
[1:47:05] build a blade of grass right amen
[1:47:09] they don't know what these things flying
[1:47:10] across here but we know what they are
[1:47:13] thanks thank you praise the lord for a
[1:47:15] profit of this last day nobody's going
[1:47:17] to drop down pick you up one these days
[1:47:19] say yes
[1:47:20] amen praise it don't worry about it amen
[1:47:23] don't don't let it worry you it's a
[1:47:25] supernatural event
[1:47:26] you can't put god in the box like you
[1:47:28] said last week
[1:47:29] supernatural event god's gonna let it
[1:47:31] happen it's gonna be
[1:47:33] amen praise and i'll look forward that
[1:47:35] time if god doesn't if the if if death
[1:47:38] doesn't take me and we go in the rapture
[1:47:41] which i'm expecting
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:44] brother banner was expected brother
[1:47:46] green was expecting i'm expecting it yes
[1:47:49] to go on a rapture but if we don't our
[1:47:51] children will see it praise the lord
[1:47:53] there'll be a time it'll come and it'll
[1:47:55] sweep us up for it
[1:47:57] changing the moment and twinkling of an
[1:47:58] eye yeah amen
[1:48:00] praise the lord of course we know we'll
[1:48:02] see our loved ones first be here for a
[1:48:04] minimum 30 days amen but i but remember
[1:48:07] saints i believe
[1:48:08] i'm going to say this in close
[1:48:12] i believe
[1:48:13] that brother brown doesn't say this and
[1:48:15] it's not the bible it's a scriptural
[1:48:17] type now
[1:48:19] but when
[1:48:21] noah went on the ark
[1:48:23] god shut the door
[1:48:25] and when god shut the door it didn't
[1:48:27] rain
[1:48:29] judgment didn't fall in its entire in
[1:48:32] its uh
[1:48:33] uh
[1:48:35] fullness at that time
[1:48:37] it didn't rain
[1:48:38] but god shut the door
[1:48:40] and there was nobody could get in that
[1:48:42] ark and there was nobody could get out
[1:48:45] amen in fact the bible says they came
[1:48:47] knocked on the door no let us sin i
[1:48:49] can't let you in god shut the door
[1:48:53] well come on out no i can't come out god
[1:48:55] shut the door
[1:48:56] nobody could get in and nobody could get
[1:48:59] out i think that's going to be that time
[1:49:01] with the dead in christ rise at that
[1:49:03] time it's going to be over
[1:49:05] yes there won't be any more coming in
[1:49:06] and there won't be any more of course
[1:49:08] why would you want to get out but there
[1:49:09] won't be any more coming in amen it'll
[1:49:12] be that time where it'll be shut blood's
[1:49:14] off the mercy seat and there'll be
[1:49:15] nothing but judgment no judgment will
[1:49:18] not have come and it's earnest yet right
[1:49:20] because we got a minimum of 30 days here
[1:49:24] but it will come yeah and the body
[1:49:26] changing will be gone and friend
[1:49:27] there'll be nothing left
[1:49:29] but judgment
[1:49:30] amen
[1:49:32] god help us we're at that time yes amen
[1:49:35] we're at that time we'll see however
[1:49:36] much time there is we don't know
[1:49:39] day week month year years we don't know
[1:49:42] but we do know that we're at that time
[1:49:44] and that season here right now as we see
[1:49:47] all these things unfolding around us
[1:49:49] amen
[1:49:50] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:50:07] praise the lord
[1:50:09] aren't you thankful that we have the
[1:50:11] promises of god's word
[1:50:13] that gives us a hope
[1:50:15] that gives us an encouragement gives us
[1:50:18] a place that we can be at peace and
[1:50:21] live
[1:50:22] and know that the plan of god is working
[1:50:25] its will in our lives
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:28] praise the lord i love him with all my
[1:50:30] heart don't you
[1:50:31] i'm glad as brother brown said i'm glad
[1:50:35] there's a place they're glad there's a
[1:50:37] vehicle to separate me from this pest
[1:50:40] house
[1:50:41] and the next time after that that i'll
[1:50:44] visit this pest house it'll be in a
[1:50:46] glorified condition so it won't be a
[1:50:47] pestilence anymore it'll be like it was

[1:54:32] i
[1:54:33] me and brother roger were talking about
[1:54:35] it this week you look on facebook and
[1:54:37] you hear things said and
[1:54:39] it's like it used to be you you'd see a
[1:54:42] one or two pass away it used to be a
[1:54:44] little thing where they went in threes
[1:54:46] and
[1:54:47] you used to say that or i've heard that
[1:54:49] i don't know people would go in threes
[1:54:52] it seems like dozens now yeah they're
[1:54:54] going in dozens and not just covet uh
[1:54:57] several code but not all coping yeah i
[1:55:00] know several people that have passed
[1:55:02] away recently and not been coping
[1:55:05] but it just it's it there's got to be a
[1:55:08] spiritual significance to what's going
[1:55:10] on now yeah
[1:55:12] and a lot of believers a lot of people i
[1:55:14] know
[1:55:15] even brother dan i pray for brother
[1:55:17] daniel evans who was here a couple weeks
[1:55:19] ago you know spoke for us uh his first
[1:55:22] cousin just passed away uh ronald evans
[1:55:25] if you know ron ronnie evans welch evans
[1:55:28] was the man brother branham was with and
[1:55:29] spoke about and he had he had his sons
[1:55:33] uh ronnie was one of them and ronnie had
[1:55:36] ronald evans ronald just passed away
[1:55:38] worked for voice of god
[1:55:40] uh used to live here in tucson went to
[1:55:42] cdo who right after i graduated he went
[1:55:45] to high school here uh and worked at the
[1:55:48] voice of god he just passed away too
[1:55:50] i just saw it and
[1:55:52] text brother dan he said yeah he
[1:55:54] had passed away and prayed for the
[1:55:56] family so and he said he was real close
[1:55:58] to ronald when they were younger so
[1:56:00] please pray for the evans family i saw a
[1:56:03] brother that worked for wmo and sent me
[1:56:06] flyers like every month of his
[1:56:08] missionary work brother don furon he
[1:56:10] just passed away
[1:56:12] two or three people i know brother
[1:56:14] uh roger talked about and
[1:56:16] he knew in florida and south africa and
[1:56:19] it just seems like and that's on top of
[1:56:21] the ones we already have known about
[1:56:23] right uh it just
[1:56:25] it's just uh
[1:56:27] there's something there's spiritual
[1:56:28] significance to this somehow i don't
[1:56:30] know what it is
[1:56:32] but i do think maybe
[1:56:34] maybe the lord
[1:56:36] maybe there's a there's a little bit of
[1:56:38] light left in this country
[1:56:41] because the supreme court this week
[1:56:43] upheld an abortion ruling in texas
[1:56:47] that as soon as you could detect a fetal
[1:56:50] heartbeat abortion became illegal
[1:56:54] now of course you know the liberals and
[1:56:56] all they're just going crazy democrats
[1:56:57] the president they're screaming and
[1:56:59] yelling but the supreme court they're
[1:57:01] the ultimate voice here when it comes to
[1:57:03] the law and the legality according to
[1:57:05] the constitution and they ruled it
[1:57:08] constitutional for that state to put a
[1:57:12] limitation on the abortion
[1:57:15] that's huge
[1:57:16] and when you think of
[1:57:18] a law being passed in this country that
[1:57:21] would be that limiting to abortion today
[1:57:24] uh it makes me have a little bit of hope
[1:57:27] amen there's a little bit of hope and
[1:57:30] i'm thinking
[1:57:31] if there's a fetal heartbeat if there if
[1:57:33] that little baby in there has got a
[1:57:34] heartbeat and people still want to rip
[1:57:37] its head off and destroy it and kill it
[1:57:40] and kill and call it tissue
[1:57:43] there's some that that's just that's
[1:57:45] demonic
[1:57:47] that's demonic but but i i'd like to
[1:57:50] celebrate the little victory at least
[1:57:51] for now that the supreme court ruled
[1:57:54] that texas can pass that law
[1:57:56] that if they uh fetal heartbeat then
[1:57:59] then the abortion's illegal so on amen
[1:58:02] you never know
[1:58:04] but there's there's so much this is
[1:58:06] going on around us just continue to pray
[1:58:09] pray for
[1:58:10] uh the needs and requests uh brother
[1:58:13] angel's dad angel jr um
[1:58:16] is is is needing a
[1:58:18] miracle yes
[1:58:21] he's needing a a real touch from the
[1:58:24] lord he's still sedated he's still on a
[1:58:26] ventilator
[1:58:28] they say there's been no change
[1:58:32] which
[1:58:32] from what i have learned with covet is
[1:58:35] not necessarily a good thing
[1:58:37] um
[1:58:38] usually they say if it's not getting
[1:58:40] better that's good or not getting worse
[1:58:42] that's good but in kobe's case when what
[1:58:44] from what i found out
[1:58:46] if you don't start getting better fairly
[1:58:50] quickly
[1:58:51] it's not good right uh that being said
[1:58:54] god's still a miracle-working guy yes
[1:58:56] god can perform a miracle god can step
[1:58:58] right into that spiritual right
[1:59:00] spiritually step right in that hospital
[1:59:02] room right now and touch angel junior
[1:59:04] and he'll get up out of that bed right
[1:59:05] now
[1:59:06] so i'm
[1:59:08] not denying that amen but uh but but our
[1:59:11] prayers prevailing before the lord for
[1:59:14] our brother so remember that if you
[1:59:16] would brother angel third is doing much
[1:59:17] much better he's doing
[1:59:19] uh
[1:59:20] doing really good actually yeah he's
[1:59:22] still having a little struggle with his
[1:59:24] breath but other than that he's he's
[1:59:26] mostly over the pneumonia he had he's
[1:59:28] doing good so and like i said i think
[1:59:30] last week the whole family tested again
[1:59:33] for colbert and tested negative uh but

[2:00:01] god uses covet as a vehicle to do it or
[2:00:05] if he uses cancer as a vehicle to do it
[2:00:07] if he uses a heart attack or what
[2:00:09] whatever vehicle god uses
[2:00:12] if if god just takes your spirit out of
[2:00:14] your body
[2:00:16] you say well why
[2:00:17] what was the cause of his death god took
[2:00:19] him home
