[14:52] better but he needs uh direction on the
[14:53] next step
[14:55] amen this is from sister matisse here
[14:58] um it's a little confused i'm not sure
[15:01] who who it is in relationship to you i
[15:02] believe it's a friend of yours
[15:04] uh if i read this right but
[15:08] there is a woman that she has a general
[15:11] body infection that
[15:13] started with the pain in her liver and
[15:15] was ignored
[15:16] as nothing but it's progressed to
[15:18] meningitis
[15:19] and she's been hospitalized
[15:24] she is a christian and appreciates our
[15:26] prayers is she's a christian is that
[15:27] correct
[15:29] yeah he's a christian i don't know about
[15:31] her oh sorry
[15:33] so it's the husband okay okay so um
[15:36] it's it's a man that is uh has this uh
[15:40] sickness that we want to remember the
[15:41] brother in prayer
[15:43] um and then i'll read a couple that
[15:45] we're saying this morning his wife is in
[15:46] the hospital
[15:47] and he covets our prayer okay
[15:50] so he's he's he's in oz where she's in
[15:53] the hospital
[15:54] she's in the hospital okay she's in the
[15:55] hospital okay so it's a woman
[15:57] a sister that you can prepare as well
[15:59] you may have
[16:00] just remembered both of them in prayer
[16:02] this morning and then this is from
[16:04] sister norma
[16:05] uh prayer uh city uh wants to raise
[16:09] uh the county water thirty to fifty
[16:11] percent i believe she lives way
[16:13] out there she's not in the room right
[16:14] now but i saw her a little bit ago
[16:17] uh but yeah she lives uh way out uh out
[16:19] of the city limits i believe so
[16:21] that would be a big increase to her
[16:24] water bill uh
[16:25] 30 to 50 percent so she's asking that we
[16:28] join
[16:29] uh with her that does not happen until
[16:31] the privately you say that
[16:33] and she wants to also put in a phrase um
[16:36] she asked prayer for her husband's
[16:38] vision and he can now see small letters
[16:40] when he's seven feet away now so thank
[16:42] you lord jesus amen amen
[16:44] thank you lord there's one more here
[16:53] so brother dennis uh he
[16:56] had just gotten his second dose of the

[17:13] and uh also for her sister pat she has
[17:16] an internal infection that
[17:18] she has had before she's just not
[17:20] feeling well uh there i believe they
[17:22] were on the stream this morning so
[17:24] both brother dennis and the dad so we'll
[17:26] remember your
[17:27] prayer brother and sister brothers and
[17:28] sisters does anyone else here have a
[17:31] prayer request they'd like to make
[17:32] mention yes

[17:35] that man that he can get his room rented
[17:38] in his little trailer because he's got
[17:40] hospital bills
[17:41] oh wow yeah okay okay i didn't
[17:43] understand that part of it okay so he
[17:44] has a room
[17:45] listed for rent the uh the the husband
[17:48] so
[17:49] that's how i found it yeah okay so we'll
[17:51] keep him in prayer for that as well
[17:53] to help with financial needs anyone else
[17:56] this morning yes
[17:58] my daughter is still recovering from a
[18:00] stroke
[18:01] symptoms um he's had a few bad days so
[18:04] just continue sure what is his name
[18:08] daniel daniel i remember daniel in
[18:11] prayer this morning anyone else
[18:13] yeah just a quick one it's an odd one
[18:15] too
[18:16] i just felt to take it to the lord um i
[18:19] have a
[18:20] i'm in an apartment complex downtown and
[18:22] uh my next-door neighbor
[18:24] um he's like l-shaped catty corner to me
[18:29] i don't know if he's autistic or what
[18:31] but he
[18:33] he watches sports and plays video games
[18:36] and you can hear him
[18:37] screaming and yelling and pounding on
[18:40] his desk but it's not
[18:41] normal i've seen guys watch sports and
[18:44] get all worked up
[18:44] but this it's like you can tell it's a
[18:46] demon in him
[18:48] wow um and i don't want him to get
[18:51] kicked out of the apartment but when
[18:52] he's doing this at three four o'clock in
[18:54] the morning then
[18:55] at 8 9 10 in the morning and at night
[18:57] all day
[18:58] it gets a little to where you can't
[19:00] sleep or you can't
[19:01] if i can hear it through my headphones
[19:03] when i'm writing music it's very
[19:04] disruptive so
[19:05] just whatever the lord's will would be
[19:07] with him i hate to see someone so
[19:09] overcome by
[19:11] the devil like that um
[19:15] live down the hall big house
[19:21] his name is sam sam okay i'm not sure if
[19:24] he's a believer or not but
[19:26] i pray the lord would make him a
[19:27] believer and deliver him
[19:29] amen um our let's just stand this
[19:32] morning as we take these needs to the
[19:33] lord

[37:29] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[37:31] pray
[37:32] amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[37:37] we'll read read verse 26 through the end
[37:41] of the chapter there
[37:43] amen genesis 1 26 and god said let us
[37:46] make man
[37:47] in our image after our likeness let them
[37:50] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[37:52] and over the fowl of the air and over
[37:54] the cattle and over all the earth
[37:56] and over every creeping thing that
[37:57] creepeth upon the earth
[37:59] so god created man in his own image in
[38:01] the image of god created he him male and
[38:04] female created he them
[38:06] and god blessed them and god said unto
[38:08] them be fruitful and multiply and
[38:10] replenish the earth
[38:11] and subdue it and have dominion over the
[38:13] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[38:15] air and over
[38:16] every leaving living thing that moveth
[38:18] upon the earth and god said behold i
[38:20] have given you
[38:21] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[38:24] the face of all the earth
[38:26] and every tree in the which is the fruit
[38:28] of the tree yielding seed
[38:30] to you it shall be for me and to every
[38:33] beast of the field and to every fowl of
[38:35] the air and to everything that creepeth
[38:37] upon the earth
[38:38] wherein there is life i have given every
[38:41] green herb for me and it was so
[38:44] and god saw everything that he had made
[38:46] and they
[38:47] and behold it was very good the evening
[38:50] in the morning with the sixth day
[38:52] you could be seated if you'd like
[38:56] amen want to really reiterate and of
[38:58] course give you the title of
[39:00] the subject that the lord put on my
[39:02] heart i kind of gave it to you a few
[39:04] weeks ago but
[39:05] i want to talk about today and lord
[39:07] willing upcoming services
[39:09] on free will free will
[39:12] subject that came on my heart a little
[39:14] while back and you know we
[39:16] we often use the subject or we often use
[39:18] the verbiage that we are
[39:20] free moral agents we were put on free
[39:22] moral agency
[39:23] and that type of verbage but a lot of
[39:25] times as as brother branham used it and
[39:28] as we use it and talk about it
[39:30] it's talked about many times as kind of
[39:32] a foregone conclusion
[39:34] it's said or spoken as something that's
[39:37] uh
[39:37] uh that's common knowledge or something
[39:40] that uh
[39:41] you know we just all universally agree
[39:43] upon but
[39:44] within that free moral agency or that
[39:46] free will
[39:48] is uh is actually some
[39:51] contention there's actually some
[39:52] disagreement there's actually
[39:54] uh some um uh back and forth between
[39:58] which is right and which is not i mean
[40:00] this goes back of course uh we could go
[40:02] back to calvinism and armenianism
[40:05] uh which we'll talk about in a few
[40:06] minutes goes back way beyond that
[40:08] uh to reach into a person's free will
[40:11] brother brown tells us and
[40:12] uh i had this little quote here of
[40:14] course uh to
[40:16] validify that and and i just want to
[40:18] take a little bit of time to lay this
[40:20] foundation
[40:21] and and a lot of it will be things that
[40:23] we've probably spoken before
[40:25] it'll be things that we uh want to just
[40:27] lay that foundation to remember or to
[40:30] remind us
[40:31] of the things and of course how i
[40:33] believe brother branham taught it how
[40:34] the scripture teaches it
[40:36] about a person's free will uh brother
[40:38] brown tells us of course that
[40:40] we have our outward being when and is
[40:43] contacted by five
[40:44] senses see tasteful smell here we have
[40:46] the inner being the spirit which a lot
[40:48] of times
[40:49] gets neglected a lot of times we don't
[40:52] consider that or bring that into a a
[40:55] consideration of part of the things
[40:57] that's going on in our lives
[40:58] but it's conscient memory affection
[41:00] reason um
[41:02] and the fifth one which is eludes me but
[41:04] you know uh conscience affection
[41:06] reason memory imagination
[41:09] the five sense is the contact of spirit
[41:11] but of course sin in the soul
[41:12] the soul of man which of course in the
[41:15] man in the soul
[41:16] so as this as we know and identify
[41:20] as being a part of a human soul we can
[41:23] see
[41:23] that this is not in a in an animal
[41:27] um this is not a part of animal nature
[41:30] this is not a part of botany life
[41:32] this is a part of a human uh whom god
[41:36] put on free moral agency
[41:38] god wasn't so interested although he is
[41:41] proud of and loves and his nature the
[41:44] way it is and the animals and the plants
[41:46] and all those they always worship him
[41:48] they were put in the motion when god
[41:50] created them
[41:51] to do what they do amen right a lot of
[41:54] times people have
[41:55] been debating and of course you read
[41:57] about evolutionists and those that
[41:58] evolve and
[41:59] then and they get into the place well
[42:01] did which was first the chicken or the
[42:03] egg well
[42:04] you know i think we had that answer
[42:06] right because god created every living
[42:08] creature and put within that creature
[42:10] the ability to reproduce right that we
[42:12] just read
[42:14] the seed was in it to reproduce of
[42:16] itself whether it's a plant or an animal
[42:18] it was given that so that god set in
[42:21] motion
[42:21] and it was the way it is and it has been
[42:24] now not since the beginning of creation
[42:26] because man fell
[42:27] and when man fell all of creation fell
[42:30] but since then
[42:31] nature just continues to evolve the way
[42:33] it is the way it does
[42:36] when it gets cold you see the birds
[42:38] flying in big flocks
[42:40] nobody came and instructed them to do
[42:42] that nobody came and
[42:44] had some seminar or class on something
[42:46] to say well
[42:47] you know you have a choice this time you
[42:49] don't have to do that no they don't have
[42:51] a choice
[42:52] right i guess technically they do but
[42:54] they get in their groups and they leave
[42:56] because their choice
[42:57] of staying is dying because if they stay
[42:59] in the fridge and cold they're not going
[43:01] to live
[43:01] right so you understand that's just a
[43:03] simple part of understanding that the
[43:05] animals and body life just
[43:07] evolve and go about doing as god set
[43:09] them in motion
[43:10] thousands and thousands of years ago but
[43:13] humans have a soul
[43:15] and in that soul as brother branham
[43:17] teaches us in that soul is a man's free
[43:20] will
[43:21] that free will is something that is
[43:23] delegated and regulated only to a human
[43:27] not to animal life dr botany life right
[43:29] the
[43:30] human has the free will because it was
[43:32] the human in which
[43:33] god was wanting to now not that he
[43:36] didn't display
[43:37] attributes of who he is in body life and
[43:39] animal life
[43:40] but the evolved is i'll use that
[43:43] terminology evolves part of god's
[43:45] creation
[43:46] because you know he started with
[43:47] blocking life on the lower level then he
[43:49] increased that by coming into the animal
[43:52] life something that took breath and had
[43:54] a beating heart
[43:55] and then he evolved that up into the
[43:56] human being would actually has a soul
[43:59] so that top so as god's evolving of
[44:02] creation came about
[44:04] god then put in that man and god wanted
[44:06] the desire of the
[44:08] man to worship him see but god wanted
[44:11] that
[44:12] man to worship him based on his own free
[44:16] will
[44:16] based on his own desire based on his own
[44:20] love for god based on his own
[44:22] desires god wanted the human to have a
[44:25] desire
[44:26] to worship him god wanted the man to
[44:28] have
[44:29] to do it of his own free will so he put
[44:32] in that human a
[44:33] soul a determinate soul so that that
[44:36] soul would dictate to that human through
[44:40] the spirit into the body
[44:41] how that human would live and react
[44:44] and decisions we would make places we
[44:47] would go things we would do things we
[44:49] would say
[44:49] how we would act how we would live how
[44:51] we would or would not worship
[44:53] who and what or we would or would not
[44:55] worship god put in that
[44:57] soul that desire that that's why that
[45:00] anchor part of your being the soul is
[45:03] the part
[45:04] that god wants the most right that's the
[45:06] part that
[45:07] uh god that's why he placed that seed in
[45:10] there from the beginning
[45:11] first john that tells us that that seed
[45:14] was placed in there that was that part
[45:16] of god
[45:17] that was to be you from before the
[45:19] foundation of the world
[45:20] that's why god placed it where not in
[45:22] your body
[45:23] not in your spirit but in your soul
[45:26] that's why in ephesians it tells us that
[45:28] the soul is sealed with the holy spirit
[45:31] of promise
[45:32] until the day of your destination until
[45:34] you get to where god has you to go see
[45:37] until your eternal destination that soul
[45:40] is sealed is sealed with god
[45:41] in there because that's the determinate
[45:44] part of you and which way you go
[45:47] so now with that determinate part in you
[45:50] that controls that
[45:51] free will now that doesn't change
[45:54] your free will you still have free will
[45:57] even
[45:58] even when you were born in sin shaped
[46:00] iniquity come the world speaking lies
[46:02] you had free will after you become a
[46:04] born again
[46:05] christian filled with the holy ghost you
[46:08] still have free will
[46:10] god you can get mad in your emotions and
[46:14] your emotions can cause you to do
[46:16] something or make a decision you should
[46:18] not make
[46:19] but you still have the free will god
[46:22] could move a person
[46:24] a certain way or cause a heart to be
[46:26] hardened or something
[46:27] but you still have free will you can
[46:30] still
[46:31] decide to do it whichever way you want
[46:34] to do it
[46:34] or say it or what you still have that
[46:37] ability
[46:37] periods right you understand that free
[46:40] will is there
[46:41] it's always been there we'll always be
[46:43] there until we leave this place
[46:45] to have the free will of god now when
[46:48] god not to
[46:49] to substantiate that by scripture we
[46:52] just read this part that god
[46:53] said about the earth god said let us
[46:56] make man in our image and our likeness
[46:59] and have them that man have dominion
[47:03] that is to have complete control to have
[47:06] authority
[47:07] over the fish of the sea the fowl of the
[47:11] air the cattle of
[47:12] all the earth every creeping thing that
[47:14] creepeth upon the earth
[47:16] the man is to have authority or dominion
[47:19] over
[47:20] so you know that dominion comes with
[47:22] responsibility
[47:24] the dominion that god gave us now you as
[47:27] we read on the rest of this
[47:28] it talks about how we have dominion it
[47:31] says we are to
[47:32] uh multiply or cleanse your earth subdue
[47:35] it
[47:36] amen that is to take it for your for
[47:38] your liking
[47:40] and man has done that now of course when
[47:42] adam lost this earth he lost it into the
[47:44] hands of satan
[47:45] and it became satan's eden and thus
[47:47] man's free will
[47:49] has done what is done to bring this
[47:50] earth to the place it's at today which
[47:52] is fit for destruction
[47:54] yes that's just the place it's at now is
[47:56] satan's e
[47:57] to be burned over purified is the place
[48:00] that it's
[48:01] it's gotten to today and it got to that
[48:03] place because of man's free will it
[48:05] didn't get to that place because
[48:06] god determined it it didn't get to that
[48:09] place because god
[48:10] caused it or god moved on somebody to
[48:12] make it that way no
[48:14] it came to be that way because of man's
[48:16] free will
[48:17] first of all it was in the hands of adam
[48:21] adam had control over it it was in his
[48:23] dominion
[48:24] it was in his control it was his
[48:27] authority
[48:28] but he had responsibility on that
[48:30] because this earth was created for
[48:32] christ for god and for his children it
[48:36] was
[48:36] we go back to colossians and read all
[48:38] that we see was created for him
[48:40] by him for his glory for his honor all
[48:43] of it was done for him
[48:45] adam lost in the garden of eden by his
[48:47] free will
[48:49] he chose to do what he did and he fell
[48:52] eve chose to do what she did she fell
[48:55] adam went after
[48:56] chose to do what he did he fell and when
[48:58] he fell all the creation fell this earth
[49:00] went into the hands of satan
[49:02] man still has control of dominion over
[49:05] it to subdue it
[49:06] but look what they do in subduing it now
[49:08] right yes
[49:10] they destroy it right you know brother
[49:12] branham said god the bible says god will
[49:14] destroy those that destroys the earth
[49:17] because this was god's creation but it
[49:19] wasn't done because god's determined
[49:21] from the beginning it was done because
[49:23] of man's free will
[49:25] man's chose to do what they've done
[49:27] man's chose to build
[49:29] bigger bombs and and and and better
[49:31] bullets and
[49:32] guns and uh they they chose to hate one
[49:35] another and they
[49:36] they chose to despise and kill one
[49:39] another since cain and abel
[49:41] kane had a choice to do what he did god
[49:44] gave him a choice god said if you'll do
[49:47] well
[49:47] i'll accept you but if you sin
[49:52] if you go that way sin lieth at the door
[49:55] right so he had that choice that was
[49:58] given to cain right there
[50:00] both men had a choice of whether they
[50:02] were going to offer a sacrifice
[50:04] and what sacrifice they were going to
[50:06] offer that was their choice
[50:09] and then when when god came to king he
[50:11] says you could go this way or you can go
[50:14] this way
[50:14] knowing he was the son of the serpent
[50:17] and knowing the nature that was in him
[50:20] god still gave him a choice god still
[50:22] gave
[50:23] him a space to repent but he would not
[50:25] repent
[50:26] every human ever born has the choice
[50:30] the decision to repent if they desire to
[50:33] do so
[50:34] now it's this this is going to take us
[50:37] into of course
[50:38] uh god's for knowledge and election and
[50:41] predestination and
[50:43] sometimes we get those terms
[50:44] intermingled but i want us to understand
[50:46] today there's a
[50:48] there's a separate and distinct
[50:50] difference
[50:51] between foreknowledge and election
[50:55] and predestination election and
[50:58] predestination are not the same
[51:00] right foreknowledge leads to election
[51:03] or to be chosen which the bible says
[51:06] elected or chosen
[51:08] two different words in and and god's
[51:11] election or
[51:11] choosing leads to his predestination
[51:15] so god knew so let's just do this for a
[51:18] second i wish i had my board but anyway
[51:22] we start with four knowledge we have to
[51:25] start with the
[51:25] the with the infinity of god god knew
[51:28] all things
[51:29] from the beginning now that's still hard
[51:32] for me to grasp
[51:34] not that i don't believe it right i
[51:35] absolutely do believe it
[51:37] but to believe or know not believe just
[51:40] i know
[51:41] right to know that there is a being
[51:44] that of course greater than us a being
[51:48] that knows everything that's going to
[51:51] happen through time
[51:53] everything brother adam said he knew
[51:55] every
[51:56] every flea every fly he said every
[52:00] gnat that would ever be on the earth god
[52:03] knew it
[52:05] and he said how and every now and how
[52:08] much
[52:08] tallow each net would produce
[52:13] now friend that that still boggles my
[52:16] little human pee brain
[52:18] i just can't comprehend that i believe
[52:20] it
[52:21] right i know it's the truth he's proved
[52:24] it over and over again of course and by
[52:25] faith in myself
[52:26] but to understand it as a human i don't
[52:29] understand that
[52:30] right i don't know what's going to
[52:31] happen in the next five minutes and
[52:33] honestly
[52:33] i don't want to know oh well unless it's
[52:36] something god thinks i need to know when
[52:37] he reveals it to me or gives a vision or
[52:40] something that's a little different
[52:41] but just to know the next minute or the
[52:43] next hour next day
[52:44] i don't want to know i just want to live
[52:46] my life
[52:47] living through the glory of god the best
[52:49] of my ability see but
[52:51] uh you think you worry now
[52:54] you think you worry and fret and under
[52:55] stress now just think if you knew what
[52:57] was coming down the road exactly
[53:02] fret and strut uh worried about every
[53:04] little thing
[53:05] but it's i don't want to know but god
[53:07] knows
[53:08] he knows all that so for him to have the
[53:12] foreknowledge to know as much as
[53:15] every gnat that would ever exist on this
[53:18] planet
[53:18] and how much tala each net would produce
[53:22] down to that very infinite uh uh
[53:25] amount what do you believe in your heart
[53:28] he knows about you
[53:29] right exactly yes and what he knows
[53:31] about us in our lives
[53:34] our great testimonies that we've had
[53:36] today friend have been
[53:37] just outstanding touched my heart so
[53:40] much i i'm sorry i think i scared you
[53:43] but i i didn't clap god clapped that's
[53:46] that was just
[53:47] something that took over me i i i that
[53:50] wasn't
[53:50] purposely done that was just the next
[53:53] thing i know god's shouting and that's
[53:55] i'm
[53:56] just praising the lord but see god knows
[53:58] all those things i don't
[54:00] we don't know that god knows it so
[54:02] that's his foreknowledge so
[54:04] first we have to understand and accept
[54:06] the fact that god
[54:07] foreknew everything so if he
[54:11] ford knew everything he knew there would
[54:14] be people in the bars this morning
[54:16] he knew there would be people worshiping
[54:18] their televisions in a sporting event
[54:20] and he knew that you would be sitting
[54:22] here worshiping god
[54:24] and listening to his word he knew that
[54:28] so he knew that so because he knew
[54:31] that you would accept and that you would
[54:34] receive
[54:34] and by your determinate decision as a
[54:38] free moral person by your free will
[54:41] that you would accept him you would
[54:43] believe him and you would receive him
[54:45] and live for him he put within you the
[54:48] ability
[54:49] to do it based on his spirit yes
[54:53] he knew that thus
[54:56] he could choose you yes now now with
[55:00] from from from free will from
[55:02] foreknowledge excuse me
[55:04] from foreknowledge to election
[55:07] or choosing so based on that
[55:10] and based on that fact he chose you
[55:14] now you say that that is in just by god
[55:18] no it's not
[55:19] it's not unjust because god knew
[55:23] what you would do and what you would not
[55:24] do right now we'll get into some more of
[55:27] this later
[55:28] but uh not today but later on but when
[55:31] paul
[55:32] was struck down you know all the light
[55:34] that saul lived
[55:36] right and how he had stephen stoner
[55:38] stood there with the coat and consented
[55:40] to it anyway
[55:41] and how he lived and persecuted the
[55:43] christian and everything that
[55:44] that saul did and there on the road to
[55:47] damascus
[55:48] jesus spoke to him and he said who art
[55:51] thou
[55:52] lord because it was something to know
[55:55] that he knew enough about
[55:56] sitting at the feet of gamalia about
[55:58] what that pillar of cloud meant
[56:00] and who it was and he acknowledged it
[56:03] who are you lord i am jesus who you
[56:05] persecute
[56:06] but now when god goes to telling ananias
[56:08] to go
[56:09] to saul ananias says oh
[56:12] no lord not me him surely lord you jest
[56:18] you know what this man has done see us
[56:21] we're humans right
[56:23] raising with god do you know what he's
[56:25] done
[56:27] amen right of course he does he knew it
[56:30] millions of years ago he again i
[56:34] my mind just explodes when i get to
[56:36] those
[56:37] explicits but i just can't uh those
[56:39] adjectives is
[56:40] before time and it just
[56:44] it just goes beyond what a human could
[56:45] comprehend but yes he knew
[56:48] and god told ananias he is my
[56:52] chosen vessel amen he is my chosen
[56:56] vessel
[56:58] now i i believe by the grace of god
[57:02] that i am looking upon many of those who
[57:06] god has chosen exactly the same way he
[57:10] told ananias about saul
[57:12] right he is a chosen vessel you are a
[57:15] chosen vessel of god yes because
[57:19] god should choose you now after all the
[57:22] life that saul lived
[57:23] after everything he did after uh the
[57:26] murderous spirit and
[57:28] and the contention to god's children and
[57:30] all that he did
[57:31] that why would god make him a chosen
[57:34] vessel
[57:36] because remember the choosing was based
[57:39] on
[57:40] for knowledge amen god knew what he
[57:44] would do
[57:45] now that knowledge doesn't take away
[57:49] his free will he could choose
[57:52] not to when ananias came to saul he
[57:56] could have said oh no this is
[57:57] foolishness this is rubbish i don't care
[57:59] anything about this so
[58:00] get away from me i don't believe that
[58:02] this is the way i'm going this way i've
[58:03] been taught
[58:04] this is how i lived it's what my grandpa
[58:07] my great-grandpa
[58:08] my all my life and i've been a baptist
[58:09] and that's just the way i believe me i
[58:11] don't need anything else see god knew
[58:12] that
[58:14] god knew that saul would receive it
[58:16] that's what made him a chosen vessel
[58:18] right
[58:19] because god knew that he choose
[58:23] chose paul he took him out
[58:27] and chose him this he elected him this
[58:30] is this was his
[58:31] hand-picked election right by god
[58:35] but he did it not out of injustice
[58:38] to say well why didn't he do it to this
[58:40] guy over here right
[58:42] because by god's foreknowledge he knew
[58:45] this guy over here
[58:47] if he were to get struck down by that
[58:48] pillar he wouldn't want to have
[58:50] anything to do with it i've told you
[58:53] before
[58:55] that when i was driving
[58:58] well i do this all the time i i try to
[59:01] do this my entire life
[59:03] i i don't just and i'm not saying
[59:06] there's anything wrong with it i'm just
[59:08] just
[59:08] the way the lord has directed me in my
[59:10] life so
[59:11] i'm not saying anything wrong with it
[59:13] but i'm not someone who just
[59:15] arbitrarily does things
[59:18] i i try not you know there's been street
[59:21] preachers there's people i've seen even
[59:23] times
[59:24] uh that they'll be preaching on the
[59:26] corner and that's
[59:28] then there's nothing wrong that's
[59:29] wonderful and maybe the lord led them to
[59:31] do that and
[59:32] so that's great but unless god shows me
[59:35] or reveals to me or
[59:37] or or puts something on my heart to do
[59:39] something like that i just i don't
[59:41] i don't move in that direction i don't
[59:44] move like that
[59:45] not that i don't want to do something
[59:48] without
[59:48] saying well you know god's pushed me to
[59:50] do something no no
[59:52] but i like to feel that little unction
[59:55] you know brother adam when he talks
[59:56] about he's going overseas
[59:58] he says you know i can go overseas and i
[1:00:01] i can go almost anywhere and preach
[1:00:03] he had managers people that were lying
[1:00:05] places up in
[1:00:06] india and africa and wherever across the
[1:00:09] country overseas
[1:00:10] anywhere around the country around the
[1:00:12] world people would line them up he said
[1:00:14] but there's just something about
[1:00:16] knowing that you've got that little
[1:00:18] unction from the holy ghost
[1:00:19] that says this is where i want you to go
[1:00:22] and this is what i want you to do
[1:00:24] and this is where i want you to be
[1:00:26] there's something about
[1:00:27] knowing now when the devil comes and
[1:00:29] tries to face you down about that you
[1:00:31] can stand and say
[1:00:33] satan get away from me i'm here in the
[1:00:36] name of the lord jesus
[1:00:38] you have no authority here praise god
[1:00:42] then you know you got something friend
[1:00:43] yes just not something that just gets
[1:00:45] arbitrarily done
[1:00:47] god doesn't do anything arbitrarily or
[1:00:50] just by
[1:00:50] chance he doesn't do it just because he
[1:00:53] he's got a wild hair to do something he
[1:00:56] doesn't do
[1:00:56] something just to mess with people but
[1:00:59] you know some people
[1:01:00] i don't know if you ever heard people
[1:01:01] say oh god just messes with people
[1:01:03] you know or topsy-turvy that kind of
[1:01:07] thing
[1:01:07] twist you around or make you go this way
[1:01:09] that way you've heard the stories people
[1:01:11] say well how could god how could a
[1:01:13] loving god
[1:01:14] cause these starving people god didn't
[1:01:16] cause charming people
[1:01:17] people's free will has caused starving
[1:01:20] people
[1:01:21] people's free will has called this place
[1:01:24] caused this place to be where it is
[1:01:25] today not god
[1:01:26] right now so when god chose paul
[1:01:30] when god told ananias that paul is a
[1:01:33] chosen vessel
[1:01:35] that meant that god had already by his
[1:01:37] foreknowledge
[1:01:39] knew that paul saul would receive it
[1:01:42] believe it and live it he knew that
[1:01:46] god knew that saul didn't know that
[1:01:49] i didn't know when i was younger you
[1:01:51] probably didn't know that
[1:01:53] i'm sure you didn't but when it come
[1:01:55] across your path
[1:01:57] at least at the right place at the right
[1:01:59] time and god spoke to your heart
[1:02:02] god knew that that would be it he knew
[1:02:05] that by your free will
[1:02:06] you would choose it accept it and
[1:02:08] believe it
[1:02:09] and now you live it you knew that that's
[1:02:12] why he chose you
[1:02:14] people say he's always unjust no he's
[1:02:16] not
[1:02:18] it's like i was saying when
[1:02:21] uh uh well the story is i was trying to
[1:02:24] make the point i was trying to make
[1:02:25] when i was driving i don't do anything
[1:02:27] arbitrarily
[1:02:29] but if i felt led now i always i always
[1:02:32] trying and i do this with
[1:02:34] almost anybody especially people that i
[1:02:36] don't know but i always try to cultivate
[1:02:38] the conversation the word will come into
[1:02:40] a place where you can talk about the
[1:02:41] lord
[1:02:42] right in whatever way that is you feel
[1:02:44] by the spirit of god leading you
[1:02:46] to cultivate that conversation to a
[1:02:47] place that you could talk about god to
[1:02:49] that person
[1:02:50] and if you give a mention or something
[1:02:52] comes up or something like that if it's
[1:02:54] received then you just a little bit
[1:02:55] further right yeah now if it's rejected
[1:02:57] if you slam the door and it's you know
[1:02:59] don't cast my pearl before swine
[1:03:03] beautiful weather we've been having on
[1:03:05] which is always a pretty mostly good
[1:03:07] subject in tucson except in june july
[1:03:09] and august
[1:03:10] then it's just hot just the greatest
[1:03:13] three letters hot and so anyway
[1:03:15] but you can talk about somebody but then
[1:03:17] you just a little bit at a time
[1:03:20] and you talk to somebody a little bit
[1:03:22] and and you try to cultivate that
[1:03:23] conversation
[1:03:25] just to talk about the lord to try to
[1:03:27] see if there's something there
[1:03:30] and i had a great conversation uh well
[1:03:33] many times but this one time continues
[1:03:35] to come back to me
[1:03:36] that i brought a man from the airport up
[1:03:38] to oro valley
[1:03:40] it was later at night and we talked
[1:03:42] about the lord and i think he went to
[1:03:43] casus or one of those churches and
[1:03:45] uh and you know he was telling me about
[1:03:48] different things and all and i just try
[1:03:50] to bring him back to the word and
[1:03:53] but anyway people like to brag on their
[1:03:55] church i'd rather brag on jesus but
[1:03:58] people like to brag on their church and
[1:03:59] that's okay
[1:04:00] that's fine um but then i try to bring
[1:04:03] it back around to the lord
[1:04:04] and i dropped the man off and it started
[1:04:07] ringing my spirit
[1:04:09] uh or i started thinking why did why
[1:04:11] didn't i say something about brother
[1:04:12] branham why didn't i bring up the
[1:04:14] message why didn't i
[1:04:15] and immediately i told you this before i
[1:04:18] think i told you even when it happened
[1:04:19] just been two or three years ago
[1:04:21] immediately after i thought that it god
[1:04:24] dropped in my spirit
[1:04:26] and said he would not have received it
[1:04:28] anyway
[1:04:30] that's right so then i think well lord
[1:04:33] that's why you didn't put it on my heart
[1:04:35] to say when he was in the car
[1:04:37] right because that's the way that's how
[1:04:39] literal i
[1:04:40] take things in my relationship with the
[1:04:41] lord that's how literal it is to me
[1:04:45] i believe that if i was just supposed to
[1:04:47] speak that to him i could regret not
[1:04:49] doing something
[1:04:50] but then i always look and think lord
[1:04:53] and make sure i'm in tune enough with
[1:04:54] the lord that i'm listening
[1:04:56] of course that's paramount first and
[1:04:58] foremost
[1:04:59] that i'm listening that i missed an
[1:05:02] opportunity lord did i miss an
[1:05:05] opportunity
[1:05:06] and then god would come back at least in
[1:05:09] this partic
[1:05:09] particular example that's probably why i
[1:05:11] remember it so vividly
[1:05:13] is god came and in my spirit immediately
[1:05:15] said he would not have received it
[1:05:17] anyway
[1:05:18] and then i thought well lord i felt my i
[1:05:21] felt clear then i felt clean i
[1:05:22] didn't feel like i was dearly to my duty
[1:05:25] and then again
[1:05:26] then it came to me and said well that
[1:05:27] that's lord that's why you didn't give
[1:05:29] it to me to say when he was in the car
[1:05:32] because he would not have received it
[1:05:33] anyway that's god's poor foreknowledge
[1:05:35] i didn't know that but god did right
[1:05:39] and because god did and i'm leaving my
[1:05:41] life according to the moving of his
[1:05:43] spirit in my life
[1:05:44] right then he is the one doing the the
[1:05:47] work he's the one that's the one walking
[1:05:49] and talking and
[1:05:50] and living it he's living through us
[1:05:54] so if it doesn't get said then then in
[1:05:57] that case
[1:05:58] in in that scenario he didn't want it to
[1:06:01] be said
[1:06:02] so if he didn't want it to be said then
[1:06:05] then you can rest assured now that's
[1:06:08] that's walking and talking with the lord
[1:06:10] that's not just saying well i just
[1:06:11] didn't want to
[1:06:12] no it's because the lord is leading you
[1:06:15] to do something
[1:06:16] and if he led you not to or you didn't
[1:06:18] come up then he's
[1:06:19] well lord there must be a reason because
[1:06:21] there's a reason for everything
[1:06:22] obviously we know that
[1:06:24] for a person's free will but now
[1:06:27] when god's path crossed saul saul
[1:06:30] received it
[1:06:31] so i accepted it that's what made him a
[1:06:33] chosen vessel
[1:06:35] a chosen elected vessel of god
[1:06:38] now that choosing now leads to
[1:06:41] predestination
[1:06:43] where god then pre-determines
[1:06:47] who you're going to be what you're going
[1:06:49] to be
[1:06:50] when you're going to live who's going to
[1:06:53] be your parents
[1:06:55] what part of the world what language
[1:07:01] your upbringing everything about you
[1:07:04] gets pre-determined at that point
[1:07:08] because god's foreknowledge knowing you
[1:07:11] would receive it
[1:07:12] causes him to choose you and once he's
[1:07:15] choose you
[1:07:16] chose you then he pre-determines or
[1:07:19] predestinates
[1:07:20] the kind of person you're going to be
[1:07:23] amen
[1:07:24] you're going to be a preacher laity
[1:07:26] member
[1:07:27] are you going to go here are you are you
[1:07:29] going to be this
[1:07:31] to fulfill this purpose you know
[1:07:35] there's another chosen vessel that's
[1:07:36] going to be in the same city around the
[1:07:38] same time
[1:07:40] and i'm making things it's extremely
[1:07:43] elementary years things
[1:07:45] i i'm breaking this down to where newton
[1:07:48] can understand it
[1:07:49] uh so this this is dumbed down for
[1:07:52] newton's benefit
[1:07:54] uh and make it very elementary the word
[1:07:57] oh there's
[1:07:58] somebody else in that city at that time
[1:08:01] that i
[1:08:01] that's a chosen vessel but i need to get
[1:08:05] the word to them
[1:08:07] well brother john's gonna be there i'll
[1:08:09] send them over there and god
[1:08:10] predetermines
[1:08:12] predestinates you
[1:08:15] or just say in this example john to go
[1:08:18] to that person
[1:08:20] that might be the one major thing that
[1:08:23] god has predestined
[1:08:25] for john's law now obviously everything
[1:08:29] else that we do as we live for him of
[1:08:30] course is
[1:08:31] is the moving of god in our lives and
[1:08:33] many times there are more things in just
[1:08:35] that one
[1:08:36] but you understand there's a predestined
[1:08:39] plan for you yeah amen there's no plan
[1:08:43] in election uh let's just let
[1:08:46] let me dumb it down even further amen
[1:08:48] this is the
[1:08:49] the uh the dummy's guide to
[1:08:52] newton's thinking they used to some of
[1:08:55] those yellow books you know that says
[1:08:56] this is a
[1:08:58] computers for dummies uh that that's
[1:09:01] where i fall in so
[1:09:02] i have to bring it down to where it
[1:09:04] makes sense to me
[1:09:06] we just had an election this country
[1:09:11] whatever you believe elected joe biden
[1:09:14] or joe biden as president
[1:09:16] but his election didn't make him do what
[1:09:19] he does
[1:09:20] to rule the country
[1:09:23] that's something that was probably in
[1:09:25] the natural
[1:09:26] predetermined by him or in his thoughts
[1:09:30] or minds oh if i get in there i'm going
[1:09:31] to do this
[1:09:32] people come and say you know sir if you
[1:09:35] get in office you should do this and
[1:09:36] other people come and
[1:09:37] he gets people all around him that
[1:09:39] they're smart supposed to be smart
[1:09:42] all around him say do this for him and
[1:09:44] help him
[1:09:45] get to this place and say you know i
[1:09:48] know you were thinking of doing this but
[1:09:50] after investigating
[1:09:51] you know you'd be better and all that
[1:09:53] all those things
[1:09:54] that's why you saw on like the first day
[1:09:56] of his presidency he signed an executive
[1:09:58] order one after the other
[1:10:00] right right i mean he said a record of
[1:10:03] of executive order just do this this and
[1:10:05] this and this this this
[1:10:07] because that was already predetermined
[1:10:09] right
[1:10:10] you understand i'm not i'm not trying to
[1:10:12] belittle the president or
[1:10:14] any of that i'm just saying i'm trying
[1:10:15] to get to the point to understand
[1:10:17] the election did not do that him being
[1:10:20] chosen
[1:10:20] did not do that the predetermined the
[1:10:24] predestination
[1:10:25] come from what it was in his mind
[1:10:29] before it got to that place right and
[1:10:32] who you were to be
[1:10:33] and what purpose you were to serve and
[1:10:36] who you were to become on this earth
[1:10:38] as a son or daughter of god is
[1:10:40] predetermined by
[1:10:41] god in his mind before you ever got here
[1:10:46] that's right amen but he had to do it
[1:10:48] based on
[1:10:49] his foreknowledge right and his choosing
[1:10:52] right amen none of that now i've got to
[1:10:56] make this
[1:10:56] loud and clear friend and i'm going to
[1:10:58] let you know what i've seen
[1:11:00] in the message what i've seen in the
[1:11:01] word and what your pastor believes
[1:11:04] and because there's other people that
[1:11:05] would disagree with me
[1:11:07] and i know people in this message that
[1:11:09] would disagree with me
[1:11:11] but to me
[1:11:14] that for knowledge coming to that
[1:11:17] choosing
[1:11:18] brings that predestination is where
[1:11:21] god that that uh brings you into play
[1:11:26] but has absolutely nothing to do with
[1:11:29] your free will
[1:11:31] right nothing to do with your free will
[1:11:35] you still have you said well i would
[1:11:38] have come to it anyway that
[1:11:40] is true why would you have come to it
[1:11:42] not because i said so
[1:11:43] right but because god already knew that
[1:11:45] you would
[1:11:47] god already knew what you would you say
[1:11:49] well my decision doesn't bear
[1:11:51] uh bear any merit yes it does
[1:11:55] you still can do what you want to do you
[1:11:57] still can decide what you want to
[1:11:59] want to do how you want to live it's
[1:12:03] god has predetermined yes but you still
[1:12:06] have a choice
[1:12:09] let's just say you woke up one morning
[1:12:11] and you just didn't feel very good
[1:12:13] and that was the day that god had you go
[1:12:15] to speak to so and so
[1:12:17] that you were supposed to be at the
[1:12:19] market or you were supposed to be
[1:12:20] somewhere where you're going to meet
[1:12:22] this person
[1:12:22] and lead them to the lord jesus because
[1:12:25] they're a chosen vessel
[1:12:27] and god's going to use you and you say
[1:12:29] yeah i don't think i'll go
[1:12:32] i'll just stay at home today it doesn't
[1:12:34] really matter anyway i can get that milk
[1:12:36] tomorrow or i can
[1:12:38] i i i can see this you might miss the
[1:12:41] very point that god wants you to do
[1:12:43] right you can still choose not to go
[1:12:47] you can even feel the action of the lord
[1:12:49] to do something
[1:12:50] and you say you know i just i just don't
[1:12:53] feel up to it i just don't feel
[1:12:55] i just don't feel good today or whatever
[1:12:57] it's your decision
[1:12:58] it's your choice you can do whatever you
[1:13:01] want to do
[1:13:02] brother branham talked about one of the
[1:13:04] greatest choices especially for a man
[1:13:06] and
[1:13:09] sometimes i wish i knew this and
[1:13:11] sometimes i'm glad i didn't know it when
[1:13:13] when uh my wife crossed my path
[1:13:16] uh but we weren't either serving the
[1:13:19] lord then anyway
[1:13:20] but was but but one of the greatest
[1:13:22] choices of man choosing a wife
[1:13:24] i mean that was one the last a messages
[1:13:27] brother ran a priest was the choosing of
[1:13:29] a bride
[1:13:30] he you listen to that his his
[1:13:33] determinate
[1:13:34] faction of that message is a person's
[1:13:38] free will
[1:13:39] yeah yeah is a man's choice
[1:13:42] decision now of course it falls on the
[1:13:45] woman too
[1:13:46] i don't mean to say that you know the
[1:13:48] message was the choosing of a bride
[1:13:50] not a husband and listen folks god made
[1:13:54] a man
[1:13:55] and he made a woman right anything
[1:13:57] outside of that is perverted right
[1:14:01] i'll leave that alone but that choice
[1:14:04] is what god put in a person that free
[1:14:07] will
[1:14:08] to decide right what they're going to do
[1:14:11] which way they're going to go who they
[1:14:13] want to choose
[1:14:14] he talks about so well this is a pretty
[1:14:16] girl i'll i'll take her because she's
[1:14:18] pretty
[1:14:19] oh this one cooks good sod she might not
[1:14:21] be much on the looks but man i'll be fat
[1:14:24] in 20 years
[1:14:26] whatever the determinate factor is
[1:14:29] they decide but that's by their free
[1:14:32] will
[1:14:32] they can choose not to a lot of people
[1:14:36] today
[1:14:37] they'll choose based on frivolous uh uh
[1:14:41] attributes in an individual and five
[1:14:43] years less than five years later they're
[1:14:45] divorced
[1:14:46] right and they do the same thing with
[1:14:48] the next one yeah and then they're
[1:14:49] divorced and they do the same thing with
[1:14:51] the next one and then they're divorced
[1:14:54] why the determining factor
[1:14:58] should outside of them will forget about
[1:15:01] the world
[1:15:02] the determinate factor should be in
[1:15:05] should based
[1:15:05] in god and the moving of the spirit in
[1:15:08] the word
[1:15:10] in the word that's why the bible says
[1:15:12] don't be unequally yoked it's
[1:15:13] in the word that's the determinate
[1:15:16] factor
[1:15:17] that that determines or breaks down a
[1:15:20] person's free will
[1:15:22] now there are people that i know in this
[1:15:24] message
[1:15:26] that no nobody here
[1:15:30] that just basically to believe and again
[1:15:33] i'm dumbing this down but basically
[1:15:34] believe
[1:15:35] that they're gonna sit in their chair
[1:15:38] and when god's ready to save them he's
[1:15:40] going to come and elevate them out of
[1:15:42] their chair
[1:15:43] bring them over to an altar somewhere in
[1:15:46] the kneeling prostrate condition
[1:15:48] and force them to give their heart to
[1:15:50] him
[1:15:53] because hey it's predetermined
[1:15:56] well then where's the man's free will
[1:15:58] right now you've got calvinism versus
[1:16:01] armenianism again
[1:16:03] and calvinism believes so much in
[1:16:05] predestination he didn't believe there
[1:16:07] was any free will
[1:16:08] and there's plenty of people in this
[1:16:09] message that believe that
[1:16:12] that believe well everything's
[1:16:13] predetermined anyway so what's the point
[1:16:16] well the point is that you're a free
[1:16:17] world agency
[1:16:19] and your decision determines which way
[1:16:22] you'll go
[1:16:24] god just happened to do that before the
[1:16:26] foundation of the world i don't
[1:16:28] you don't he does that's how he chose
[1:16:33] but that predetermined factor now lies
[1:16:35] in us
[1:16:36] what am i going to do what decision am i
[1:16:40] going to make
[1:16:40] which way am i going to go with it i'm
[1:16:42] not going to just sit here
[1:16:44] and just wait for god to come scoop me
[1:16:46] up and throw me at an altar somewhere
[1:16:48] right i got to make a decision to do
[1:16:51] something
[1:16:53] i've got to make a decision to make a
[1:16:55] move for the lord
[1:16:56] even if i don't understand it maybe if i
[1:16:59] don't even agree with it
[1:17:02] i gotta make that move i gotta put
[1:17:04] myself in that position
[1:17:06] so that god can do something amen
[1:17:10] god's not gonna force you to do anything
[1:17:12] yes
[1:17:13] god struck down saul god blinded saul
[1:17:17] god sent ananias to saul but saul still
[1:17:20] had a choice
[1:17:23] he still could decide each other the way
[1:17:26] he wanted to go
[1:17:27] right he had because that's our choice
[1:17:30] see what does it mean to god and this
[1:17:34] would be an
[1:17:35] unjust god if he forced you or
[1:17:38] made you to do something
[1:17:41] let's just say god's gonna force this
[1:17:43] side of the room
[1:17:45] to serve him and this side of the room
[1:17:47] he's not
[1:17:48] he don't care about you at all
[1:17:51] well that is an unjust god and that's
[1:17:54] the way a lot of people picture
[1:17:55] or plant or or paint the picture in your
[1:17:58] mind of who god is
[1:17:59] right how could god do this
[1:18:02] how could god allow this
[1:18:06] it's not god it's your decision
[1:18:09] it's your choice god gave you look in
[1:18:12] the beginning
[1:18:13] god gave the man the choice yes god
[1:18:17] gave the man the decision the
[1:18:19] decision-making ability
[1:18:22] because god wants you to serve him
[1:18:25] of your own free will right that's right
[1:18:28] he wants you to serve him
[1:18:30] because you love him not because of
[1:18:33] anything he's done
[1:18:34] for you not because of anything he's
[1:18:36] done for your family or
[1:18:37] church not because he's uh
[1:18:41] blessed you so much you know when all
[1:18:43] those things run out you get in those
[1:18:45] dry places then what have you got right
[1:18:47] yeah right
[1:18:49] you got a god that you're gonna keep
[1:18:50] serving well he's done anything for you
[1:18:53] lately
[1:18:53] as you know the saying goes what have
[1:18:55] you done for me lately
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:19:01] so what then becomes your determining
[1:19:02] factor
[1:19:04] for your choice amen
[1:19:07] what's your determining factor what's
[1:19:09] your determining factors for getting up
[1:19:11] every morning
[1:19:14] maybe some people don't i don't know
[1:19:17] what's your determining factor for going
[1:19:19] to work
[1:19:22] what's your determining factor for uh
[1:19:24] the
[1:19:25] the meal you eat what was your
[1:19:27] determining factor from coming to church
[1:19:29] today
[1:19:31] great amen amen i'll tell you
[1:19:35] i came here because i wanted to yes
[1:19:37] ma'am
[1:19:38] i came here and i didn't know who else
[1:19:41] was coming
[1:19:42] right i assumed and believed unless you
[1:19:44] know sometimes people say that they're
[1:19:45] not doing well like brother dennis
[1:19:47] brother and sister pat and
[1:19:49] and danny and i you know i hear those
[1:19:51] things but i don't know
[1:19:53] i didn't come here because you i didn't
[1:19:56] even necessarily come here for you
[1:19:59] i came here because of the lord jesus i
[1:20:02] came here because i
[1:20:03] wanted to come here i came here hoping
[1:20:06] and believing i would see you and i
[1:20:07] enjoy that very much but i don't know
[1:20:11] but that's not my reason that's not my
[1:20:13] purpose
[1:20:14] i'm assuming you didn't come to hear me
[1:20:17] i'm assuming you didn't come to see one
[1:20:18] another hear some special song or
[1:20:20] or feel some tingling down your spine
[1:20:22] you come because you love the lord
[1:20:25] you came because you love the lord jesus
[1:20:27] and his word declares forsake not to sin
[1:20:30] to govern yourselves together
[1:20:31] even that much more as we see and we do
[1:20:33] see
[1:20:34] that the approach that's right amen but
[1:20:37] you just did it because of
[1:20:38] out of your heart because you love the
[1:20:39] lord yes and that's just the bottom line
[1:20:41] what god who's there other than you or
[1:20:43] what god does from that point that's not
[1:20:45] up to you
[1:20:46] right but the results are so beautiful
[1:20:50] aren't they
[1:20:50] and that desire just grows greater and
[1:20:52] greater amen
[1:20:54] that desire just gets greater and
[1:20:56] greater and see that that becomes a
[1:20:58] determinate factor in your
[1:21:00] life because that's your it's your
[1:21:02] choice
[1:21:03] that's your free will you didn't come
[1:21:05] here this morning because god made you
[1:21:06] come here
[1:21:07] you come here because you wanted to come
[1:21:09] here and that's been the exact same
[1:21:11] thing
[1:21:12] from the beginning of time from adam and
[1:21:14] eve and the garden of eden
[1:21:16] had dominion over everything in this
[1:21:18] earth now people want to blame
[1:21:20] everything on god
[1:21:21] but everything is not god's fault in
[1:21:24] fact nothing's his fault
[1:21:25] everything's man's fault from the
[1:21:27] beginning god made the perfect place
[1:21:30] he made the perfect being and he put him
[1:21:32] in the uh
[1:21:33] perfect state to be in yes everything
[1:21:36] from there
[1:21:37] was man's decision right everything
[1:21:41] amen everything from there was god's
[1:21:43] decision god doesn't make you do
[1:21:45] anything
[1:21:46] now there are some things that just
[1:21:48] spirit just hit me so i don't know if
[1:21:50] anybody out there is thinking this
[1:21:51] but they're i'm going to get into some
[1:21:53] of this a little later too
[1:21:54] not today uh yeah well what in the bible
[1:21:57] god hardened so-and-so's heart
[1:22:00] uh god this lying spirit and and these
[1:22:03] things happen in the bible
[1:22:05] you gotta understand god
[1:22:09] those things be determined does not
[1:22:12] change a person's free will
[1:22:14] right sometimes god will test you
[1:22:18] to see what decision you're going to
[1:22:20] make right he'll test you
[1:22:22] to find out what your free will
[1:22:25] determinate purpose is going to be
[1:22:27] he does that on purpose that not only
[1:22:31] does
[1:22:31] he of course knows who you are but let
[1:22:34] you know
[1:22:35] well is there a shortfall here in my
[1:22:37] life yeah is there something i'm not
[1:22:39] doing
[1:22:40] is there someplace i'm not reaching to
[1:22:42] is there some cuz
[1:22:44] honestly friend and you know as well as
[1:22:46] i do in church of course everything
[1:22:49] looks
[1:22:49] rosy and glowing and every family's the
[1:22:52] perfect family that sits on the pedestal
[1:22:54] you know but when you get in the four
[1:22:56] corners of your house
[1:22:58] right a lot of times it's a little
[1:22:59] different story right
[1:23:01] and most of the time other people don't
[1:23:03] understand that
[1:23:04] right but we do because we live
[1:23:07] it and god does because of course you do
[1:23:10] it before the foundation of the world
[1:23:13] so where does the determinate factor
[1:23:15] come from your free will
[1:23:18] what is your choice what is your desire
[1:23:21] see what
[1:23:22] what is what drives a person
[1:23:26] i i got to post here in a minute i
[1:23:28] haven't read any of this but
[1:23:30] what what drives the person
[1:23:34] there there's there's a motive
[1:23:38] behind everybody's choice behind
[1:23:41] every choice you make there's there's an
[1:23:44] end result determining
[1:23:48] what you choose to do there's a motive
[1:23:52] in you there's a maybe that's a good
[1:23:55] place to stop this too
[1:23:56] there's a motive in you that drives you
[1:24:01] to make your choice yeah because you
[1:24:05] believe
[1:24:05] that the choice you make is going to end
[1:24:07] up with this
[1:24:08] positive result whatever it is
[1:24:12] now sometimes we make choices that uh
[1:24:16] we just don't even think about it
[1:24:20] things that usually get us in trouble
[1:24:21] probably things we probably shouldn't do
[1:24:24] you don't think about things you're not
[1:24:25] supposed to do because you know what the
[1:24:27] result is going to be
[1:24:28] and you don't want to think about it
[1:24:29] because you want to make that decision
[1:24:30] that choice
[1:24:31] regardless and people do that
[1:24:34] they make decisions and choices
[1:24:36] regardless of what those consequences
[1:24:38] might be
[1:24:39] they do it anyway but there's still a
[1:24:41] motive there's still
[1:24:43] something that's in that person that
[1:24:45] that's determining
[1:24:48] what they're going to do what is uh
[1:24:51] the motivating factor behind our free
[1:24:54] will choices
[1:24:55] what is that motivating factor what is
[1:24:57] motivating you to think that way
[1:24:59] what is motivating you to make that
[1:25:01] decision what is motivating you to
[1:25:04] operate yourself in this way or or over
[1:25:06] this way or something
[1:25:08] there's always something behind it amen
[1:25:11] and you got to understand
[1:25:12] of course every single single single
[1:25:15] solitary move
[1:25:16] you try to make for the lord jesus
[1:25:18] there's going to be a
[1:25:19] devil there to try to keep you from it
[1:25:22] and try to sway you from it that's right
[1:25:24] amen i want to be sweet and kind to my
[1:25:26] wife or my husband today
[1:25:27] or i want to be the best mother father
[1:25:30] my children and whatever else and then
[1:25:31] the devil comes there and says
[1:25:34] and then next thing you know you're
[1:25:36] making a choice decision or something
[1:25:37] you probably
[1:25:38] should make but you got to understand
[1:25:41] that's the enemy yes amen that's the
[1:25:43] devil that's right
[1:25:45] if it's coming against what god is doing
[1:25:47] that's the devil
[1:25:49] yes that's the enemy so make sure that
[1:25:52] that motivating factor remember when
[1:25:54] brother branham talked
[1:25:54] or billy paul's testimony about his son
[1:25:58] when he came and kept interrupting them
[1:25:59] when they were writing letters together
[1:26:01] they were answering letters brother
[1:26:03] billy paul and brother branham
[1:26:05] and billy some would come up i forget
[1:26:07] which one it was
[1:26:08] and he would interrupt him and said no
[1:26:10] no you know go away
[1:26:12] two or three times i forgot what it was
[1:26:13] came up and interrupted him
[1:26:15] and like the last time billy paul took
[1:26:17] him in
[1:26:18] and swatted him on his diaper and skidd
[1:26:20] him across four a couple inches
[1:26:22] and the boy's screaming and crying and
[1:26:24] he's upset you know
[1:26:25] daddy whacked and probably didn't even
[1:26:27] feel anything because his diapers you
[1:26:28] know
[1:26:28] of course back then they weren't oh they
[1:26:31] were clothed i don't know
[1:26:32] anyway sent him across the floor anyway
[1:26:34] a couple inches he probably did feel
[1:26:36] it back then but the kid goes running
[1:26:38] away and crying and screaming and
[1:26:40] and billy paul's like okay daddy i think
[1:26:42] we'll be okay let's get back to work no
[1:26:46] he said i've got something to say to you
[1:26:49] amen and he says what's the matter
[1:26:53] he said you struck that boy he said you
[1:26:56] mean i disciplined him he said no you
[1:26:58] hit him in anger
[1:26:59] right yes when you hit that boy in anger
[1:27:01] you upset his angel
[1:27:03] and god is very displeased with this
[1:27:05] situation and with this atmosphere right
[1:27:07] now
[1:27:08] and you know if god was just pleased
[1:27:10] with it brother branham was displeased
[1:27:12] with it
[1:27:12] yeah right amen he said you struck that
[1:27:15] kid and that kid in anger
[1:27:16] that child and anger and you upset and
[1:27:18] angered that angel
[1:27:20] that protects that boy and that upset
[1:27:23] the lord and this atmosphere is not
[1:27:24] working
[1:27:26] amen right yeah now
[1:27:29] what do you think is determining
[1:27:30] decision factor of this decision is
[1:27:32] going to be from that point on
[1:27:35] right well motion takes over
[1:27:39] things happen amen the devil comes and
[1:27:43] tries to upset everything yeah but
[1:27:46] there's
[1:27:46] but but ultimately ultimately
[1:27:50] the end is with us
[1:27:54] it's our choice our decisions our
[1:27:57] free will it's our free will we have
[1:28:00] free will
[1:28:00] to decide everything that's gotten to
[1:28:03] the place it's gotten today in this
[1:28:05] world
[1:28:05] from the time that god created it was
[1:28:07] because of man's free will
[1:28:09] yeah still that way today i'm gonna go
[1:28:11] i'm gonna read this
[1:28:12] i'll close the god of this evil age as
[1:28:17] we talked about this but he said the
[1:28:18] outside man is physical being was
[1:28:20] controlled by five senses
[1:28:22] inside man is a spirit man controlled by
[1:28:24] five senses conscious love so forth
[1:28:26] the outside man see takes phil smell
[1:28:28] here but the inside of that spirit is a
[1:28:31] soul it's controlled by one thing and
[1:28:32] that's your free will
[1:28:34] amen that's why it matters so much
[1:28:37] well one big reason it matters so much
[1:28:40] you become that you get born again
[1:28:42] because in the determinate factor of
[1:28:44] your being is your soul
[1:28:47] is being influenced by god
[1:28:50] then you're going to have a godly result
[1:28:53] yes
[1:28:53] going through the spirit of course and
[1:28:55] through the flesh and that all gets
[1:28:57] muddied and muddled
[1:28:58] but the but the but the result is
[1:29:01] the point is that if god is in there
[1:29:04] that determinate factor in your being by
[1:29:06] your free will
[1:29:08] is god see because that free will is in
[1:29:11] your soul
[1:29:12] it is controlled by one thing your free
[1:29:14] will you can accept what the devil
[1:29:16] says or accept what god says
[1:29:19] you can now god knew the decision again
[1:29:23] for knowledge
[1:29:25] but you can still choose if it's the
[1:29:28] spirit of god
[1:29:29] it'll feel uh feed on the things of god
[1:29:32] and it won't feed on anything the world
[1:29:34] jesus said if you love the world thinks
[1:29:35] the world is because the love of god's
[1:29:37] not even entered in that inner part
[1:29:39] satan has deceived you and man shall not
[1:29:41] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:29:42] that perceiveth out the mouth of god
[1:29:45] that determinate factor in each of us
[1:29:47] that free will
[1:29:48] our free will we always have a choice
[1:29:52] when people try to present this word
[1:29:56] present this message with the degree of
[1:29:59] uncertainty about your decision
[1:30:01] process they're in my opinion they are
[1:30:04] wrong
[1:30:07] the thing that puts us in that position
[1:30:10] is the fact that god already knows that
[1:30:12] we would have done that that we would be
[1:30:14] that that was our choice our decision
[1:30:16] he knew that we would do that amen
[1:30:19] that's why he
[1:30:20] chose you that's why he predetermined
[1:30:24] who you would be what you'd be but that
[1:30:27] doesn't take away my free will
[1:30:29] i can still decide to choose what i want
[1:30:30] to and not want to
[1:30:32] amen people screaming yeah i hear about
[1:30:34] the united states oh this is a free
[1:30:36] country
[1:30:36] and it's freer than most right it's uh
[1:30:39] best country in the world
[1:30:40] still in my opinion there's there's no
[1:30:42] freedom out here
[1:30:44] if it was out it's free there's nothing
[1:30:45] free outside of golf
[1:30:47] right period oh i'm i want to remain
[1:30:50] free you weren't free to begin with amen
[1:30:54] if you could sit down if we can sit down
[1:30:56] i'm getting late
[1:30:57] if we could sit down and actually
[1:31:00] examine how this we americans humans
[1:31:05] are funneled like cattle to go certain
[1:31:08] directions and think
[1:31:09] certain ways and feel certain things
[1:31:11] about about everything basically yeah
[1:31:15] i mean from from media to news to
[1:31:18] billboards to
[1:31:19] other people we get steered
[1:31:22] in in ways that we just don't even
[1:31:25] understand
[1:31:27] we just we don't even comprehend and a
[1:31:30] lot of people don't even recognize
[1:31:31] that they've been they have been
[1:31:33] manipulated to go a certain way or make
[1:31:36] a certain decision
[1:31:38] they've been they've been
[1:31:42] motivated to make a decision or
[1:31:45] or to exercise their free will
[1:31:48] and afraid in a way that's going to be
[1:31:50] purposeful to
[1:31:51] someone's in the agenda agenda
[1:31:55] their end result is just think about it
[1:31:58] sometimes
[1:31:59] how this how we as people are determined
[1:32:03] to move a certain way amen it's the
[1:32:06] things you eat
[1:32:07] places you go amen
[1:32:10] there's always those factors that are
[1:32:12] there it
[1:32:13] that that motivates and and drives us
[1:32:17] into certain little channels yeah amen
[1:32:19] that's why
[1:32:20] people go certain ways they go and and
[1:32:23] then of course that's why
[1:32:24] that's one reason this country's broke
[1:32:26] so dividedly into two parts
[1:32:28] mostly three parts if you ask me
[1:32:31] but we're the christians not a part of
[1:32:33] this world anyway so it's really just
[1:32:35] two
[1:32:36] the three part is the bride's getting
[1:32:37] ready to lead then they'll just be too
[1:32:39] hard
[1:32:39] and there's and they're so so divisive
[1:32:43] because the one has said oh that's just
[1:32:45] a horrible way i'll never go that way
[1:32:47] so they just go this way you know says
[1:32:49] oh that's a horrible way i'll never go
[1:32:51] that way so they just go this way
[1:32:52] and then they they chunnel down their
[1:32:54] little channels just like cattle
[1:32:56] being proud amen
[1:32:59] they don't realize uh they're exercising
[1:33:02] their free will for
[1:33:03] other people and entities amen
[1:33:06] let's stand if we could
[1:33:16] amen people
[1:33:20] get determined determinate
[1:33:27] by different things different purposes
[1:33:32] but i want my purpose and the
[1:33:34] determining factor of my life to be
[1:33:37] the holy spirit that's in there the the
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:40] seat of my free will be the holy spirit
[1:33:47] that that spirit moves me
[1:33:51] in whichever way he wants it to go
[1:33:54] because it's
[1:33:55] it's god who's chosen it that's what
[1:33:58] makes us the sheep
[1:34:00] right that we're not driven
[1:34:03] as the world does we just talked about
[1:34:05] but we're led
[1:34:07] amen we're led god leads us as free
[1:34:10] mortal agents this thing is little
[1:34:11] course
[1:34:12] 3 17.
[1:34:16] maybe next week i'll get past the first
[1:34:18] two lines of my nose
[1:34:21] uh 3 17.
[1:34:28] sometimes when something's been on your
[1:34:29] heart so long you
[1:34:31] uh you just speak what the lord gives so
[1:34:38] i'll say yes lord yes
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:34:57] and my answer will be yes
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:19] [Applause]
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:39] i will trust you
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:54] yes
[1:35:56] praise the lord all saints how many
[1:35:59] times have you gotten in a place
[1:36:00] where you said oh god how did i ever get
[1:36:03] here
[1:36:06] trace it back fine because you
[1:36:10] made the wrong choice you made the wrong
[1:36:13] decision over here
[1:36:15] that wasn't the that wasn't the plan i
[1:36:17] had for you
[1:36:18] that wasn't the the road i had laid out
[1:36:21] for you
[1:36:22] you chose to go this way and it may have
[1:36:25] taken a while but at the end of that
[1:36:27] road was destruction
[1:36:29] he said lord how did i ever get here
[1:36:31] well you shouldn't have chose to do this
[1:36:33] amen but we still had a choice yeah yeah
[1:36:36] that's when we get in god's
[1:36:38] seat oh
[1:36:41] one more thing that's how people
[1:36:45] have a hard time even understanding
[1:36:47] god's permissive will and his perfect
[1:36:49] will
[1:36:50] right because when you're in his perfect
[1:36:52] will oh absolutely
[1:36:54] you think god that's the path that god's
[1:36:56] paid for me and i don't have free will i
[1:36:58] don't have choice so
[1:37:00] i just i just go like a robot down this
[1:37:02] road but then where does god's
[1:37:03] permissible come in
[1:37:06] his permissive will comes in when you've
[1:37:08] made a decision a choice
[1:37:10] by your free will that took you off that
[1:37:13] perfect will path
[1:37:15] amen praise the lord
[1:37:18] so thankful that we can still say yes
[1:37:21] lord amen we can still say yes
[1:37:25] the chosen vessel predestined by god
[1:37:29] amen and thankful to be one of his
[1:37:32] you're thankful to be one of his today
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:35] you made that choice you made that
[1:37:37] decision yes
[1:37:39] sometimes against all odds sometimes
[1:37:41] against every one of your family members
[1:37:44] every one of your friends you may have
[1:37:46] made that determining decision
[1:37:48] based on absolutely nobody's support in
[1:37:50] your entire life
[1:37:52] anywhere and yet you decided god knew
[1:37:55] that
[1:37:56] amen i grew up in a christian home and
[1:37:58] i'm thankful for my godly parents
[1:38:01] who came in this message in the 70s and
[1:38:03] raised me in it and i thank
[1:38:04] god for that but a lot of people didn't
[1:38:08] a lot of people didn't have that but yet
[1:38:10] the decision
[1:38:11] the choice that you made yet with all
[1:38:15] odds we're against it for him
[1:38:17] amen that just prejudice proof shows
[1:38:20] amen that's god's
[1:38:22] god's way in your life and your choice
[1:38:24] you made that choice you made that
[1:38:26] decision
[1:38:27] amen and i'll go out on a limb here with
[1:38:29] all of you
[1:38:30] well i'll just say it for myself best
[1:38:32] choice decision i ever made
[1:38:34] amen was for him yeah amen
[1:38:37] best one i ever made no offense dear
[1:38:40] love you
[1:38:41] love my children with every ounce of
[1:38:44] fiber in my being
[1:38:45] amen but that's the best decision i've
[1:38:48] ever made
[1:38:49] amen i didn't make that decision there
[1:38:52] wouldn't be no hurt or them
[1:38:54] probably or you praise the lord aren't
[1:38:56] you thankful
[1:38:58] thank you jesus help us continue on from
[1:39:01] this
[1:39:02] day forward amen to make that
[1:39:05] just a little more a little a little
[1:39:07] tighter decision so we don't end up in
[1:39:09] his permissive will maybe
[1:39:11] yeah amen or at least not quite so much
[1:39:13] yeah
[1:39:14] god bless you appreciate you thank you
[1:39:16] so much for being here today
[1:39:18] nothing nothing new to report on the
[1:39:20] other building

[1:39:25] be here again next week by the grace of
[1:39:27] god and

[1:39:29] know or keep you informed if it's
[1:39:31] something very important i'll let you

[1:39:34] we'll just uh keep you updated next
[1:39:36] sunday i haven't heard from him in a
[1:39:37] couple weeks
[1:39:38] but i'll probably try myself to reach
[1:39:41] out this week if i don't hear anything
[1:39:42] at least get an update
[1:39:44] so um we'll just by the grace of god
[1:39:49] amen to the prayers keep going by the
[1:39:50] grace of god i'm thankful he allows us
[1:39:53] to have this place
[1:39:54] and so far it looks like micah gets here
[1:39:57] for india it looks like nobody else is
[1:39:58] even getting it since we've been here
[1:40:00] nobody else has even before we was
[1:40:03] before we reserved this
[1:40:05] the guy was telling us they they
[1:40:06] reserved this place out all the time
[1:40:08] and it seems like every time we come in
[1:40:10] everything's exactly the way we left it
[1:40:12] so nobody else is using it for us
[1:40:15] so praise the lord amen i'm thankful for
