bless any want to have a quick testimon on your heart amen today before we change you the service just real um it's kind of more of a a thingle for the opportunity to witness just a couple of my friends have started asking me questions out of the blue about like God and like related to fires and how God certain things happen and it's really open doors for me to explain God and thankfulness and how God operates and God's not a person he's not just going to stand there and lick his thingers and put a fire out he uses people and other various questions about hell and heaven and I've explained things like the great white and judgment all kinds of various things so doors are opening for some reason so thankful for that opportunity praise the Lord wonderful he doesn't know but I pray for him all the time that his friends will see Jesus in him amen amen that's my prayer that to me his testimony is a result of the prayers I've been praying so praise the Lord amen God knows God is mindful amen praise the Lord Jesus amen let's go ahead and stand then if you will and we'll turn in the scripture over to Psalms chapter 51 I've been feeling for actually quite some time now uh to bring this series uh it was one of the first things that the Lord had put on my heart when we started the church years ago and um I I was kind of wavering about it a little bit to go back again and then I then I remembered no one in here except for my wife and Dennis this morning uh was here when we went through this series but then I went to Brother Rogers the other night uh when he was having those meetings and he hit this subject very uh very hard and so I thought well I felt Lord that was a confirmation uh to me amen and then uh you know even even when you get that you still waver I do sometimes waver a little bit as to whether you should do it or not and then the Lord uh gave me a song uh I forgot who sang it but I thought well Lord I'm just that that solidified it for me amen I was going to start last week uh with part one on this and then the lord gave me that other thought that we did speak on and then when Micah sang that song that he sang it just everything just felt so perfectly in place things it's just hard for me to describe but this just God is just wonderful amen he's just so good and I trust him fully completely Psalms 51 now amen we're just going to read one verse of scripture but before we do can we just bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus father God we're so thankful of the words that were spoken the songs that were sang the testimonies that were given the worship Lord but God most of most of of of anything Lord we're so thankful God to F your spirit and know that you're here once again with us thank you Lord for the blessings that you give father so far in this time and and pray Lord that all of our worship father was a sweet smelling savior to you God may you just continue to bless and strengthen us move Upon Us in a special Supernatural way father for without you all of this would be in vain all of this will mean nothing Lord this will just be dead letters just words on a page just words that we speak but Lord if you come and anoint it Lord and anoint our ears to receive it that you reveal to us and help us to see in here what you would have us to know God then will be worth through eternity God the the reverberation of what is done here today will continue on Lord bless again those that are here those may be streaming Lord we're just thankful God for all most of all we're thankful for you yes we pray Lord once again you would anoint these lips Lord to speak only what you'd have to be said Lord anoint our ears to receive that that you'd have to be received and accomplish in here this place today what you set this service forth for God for this is your house this is your time God we're just here as Servants of you lord lord we just pray giving it all to you Lord that you would bless it now in the precious holy lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ again we pray amen amen amen Psalms 51 one verse of scripture verse 5 and we'll let you be seated amen uh there's a lot more goes into this but I just want to read verse five to get the context now behold David says Now Behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me you can be seated if you like many times we've heard that uh that scripture phrased as born in in born in sin shap iniquity come the world speaking lies we say that we quote that many times this is the scripture reference of which it comes from recognizing we as just Mortals born in sin shaped in iniquity come the world speaking lies no fault of our own amen but it is fults of our own if we don't receive and accept what Christ has done for us to be redeemed back to where we were amen that's the that's the point that we look that we want to get back where we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen now let's go over to St John chapter 3 and uh read a few verses of scripture here I want to speak and start on the subject the topic of adoption uh today uh adoption uh this will be born again part one uh so some of the beginning of this is fairly Elementary to most of us hopefully it'll just be mostly bring back to our remembrance but understanding of course to uh that we are purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ and we belong to him amen amen amen we are a part of his body praise the Lord St John chapter 3 I just want to begin reading with the first first verse here uh first verse amen there was a man Nam uh there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and why did he come by night well he probably didn't want any of the other Pharisee buddies seeing him come to Jesus especially what he gets gets ready to tell him and said unto him Rabbi we know that that are that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him now that wasn't shared by every Pharisee as we know as we read the scripture and go through the Bible that wasn't shared by most of his Pharisee buddies but he obviously a man of uh of enough Integrity to know to go to Jesus Christ and say that you have to be from God because nobody can do what you do except God's with him amen amen praise the Lord Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen now this first place we come to that talks about a new birth being born again a new birth uh not a new birth naturally but a new birth spiritually now him having a limited amount of spiritual understanding did not realize that so his whole his whole thought is natural so Nicodemus comes back and says unto him how can a man be born when he is old so all he's thinking is natural can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born but God but Jesus wasn't talking natural Jesus was talking spiritual he wasn't talking about a new natural birth he was talking about a new spiritual birth because why because as David said we were all born in sin shap iniquity come the world speaking lies so we all needed a new or rebirth a regeneration everyone who is born a woman from that time has to be bor has to be born again of the spirit of God Amen our flesh will still be the same we'll look the same amen our uh outward appearance if you will things about our appearance will change because of the way we change the way we dress and act and the things that we do and and what we wear and not wear and things like that but our our appearance will be the same but that's not what he's he's talking about a spiritual birth amen amen because the spiritual birth is what God is concerned with not the natural birth the spiritual birth amen and that's where that's where he do he he fails to understand can a man enter into his mother's womb the second time no it's a spiritual birth he's talking about be born again regenerated renewed amen so that you're a new creature in Christ Jesus yes Jesus answered verely verily I say unto thee accept a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now first he says unless you're born again you can't see the kingdom of God now he's telling them unless you're born again you cannot enter into the kingdom of God Amen so two two facets Jesus actually makes points of but that which is born of the flesh is flesh amen it is the flesh that's what it is we're born in the flesh we're flesh beings we're human beings amen we live in the flesh but we don't live of the flesh right and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again now he didn't make it an option now it's not uh your choice you must it's a must so every human born of woman must be born again amen of the spirit as he told here as he told him of the water of the spirit you must be born borned again to be able to enter into the kingdom of God able words is the spirit it's not flesh because the flesh is flesh but the spirit is Spirit the spirit is life the flesh is death the spirit is life amen you must be born of the spirit of God so Marvel not now that I say you must it's a must amen anyone that come into this world uh uh drawing breath must be born again spiritually or you will not see you will not enter into the kingdom of God it's that simple Yes amen there's no handshake there's no joining Church there's no good deeds there's no proper life there's there's you can't live good enough to make it amen all of our righteousness the best Deeds that we can ever muster up the best things that we can ever try to offer to God is filthiness in his eyes right the Bible says our righteousness is is filthy rags amen so we don't depend on our righteousness we depend on his amen we depend on the righteousness of God who we become the righteousness of God he died so we could take he died and took our place so we could take his place and become the very righteousness of Jesus Christ therefore you must be born again the wind bloweth where eth verse now where it listes and thou hearest the sound thereof but c not tell whence it come and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be still thinking natural still thinking In the Flesh amen how can these things be Jesus answered and said unto here thou art a master of Israel and knowest not these things that you must be born again how can you be a master how can you be a teacher teacher master Master teacher how can you be a teacher of of of of scripture and not know these things how can you be teaching people uh spiritual things and not know the most important spiritual thing that there is to learn and that is a new birth how can you do that amen of course he didn't know because it can't be received but by Revelation it has to be received by Revelation can't be received by the natural can't be received by the flesh can't be understood by the flesh can't be explained by the flesh it's got to be received believed by the spirit amen amen because the spirit is what brings life and the spirit is what we live by and the spirit is the one that reveals it to you so you understand that's why Jesus said uh I thank thee father thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent but revealed them unto babes such as would learn amen so there are those people that will learn yes amen because because they receive that Revelation they receive God's word amen and those are the ones that God that god holds um in truth now this uh I wanted to read to you about um uh probably the most important thing of understanding adoption adoption is not your birth right being born again is absolutely you don't you don't don't reach your place of adoption or your placement in the body of Christ unless you've been born again am you have to be born again first but understanding that's just the beginning of your journey yes your new birth is just your beginning yes uh when I when I came out of my mother's womb my daddy wasn't there to hand me the car keys amen there wasn't there wasn't a an HR uh person from this great organ organization offer me a job with a pen and a contract as I'm just starting to draw breath amen I'm not getting car keys and a contract to a $100,000 year job amen I was I just born I just came into this world I got a lot of growing to do I got a lot of learning to do yes I got a lot of growing up and maturing to do before I could ever think about getting a driver's license or holding a job or doing anything of that type of importance going to school learning those things come because we grow amen as we grow we learn so as you grow as you're born spiritually you're just a babe in Christ you just started amen God's not going to hand you the car keys amen God's not going to put some great thing we're just born and we're just born in the spirit of God we're starting to learn we're starting to grow that's just the beginning the the the adoption the placement is is a part of that new birth that we that we have placed into the body of Christ and knowing our position in Christ you realize that knowing your position in Christ is really is as important uh almost as important anyway as your new birth amen knowing your position is just as important let me read this to you amen uh he said Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous little you know kind of walking out on thin ice as we call it but we feel maybe this point be kind of good to bring and that's kind of I guess the point that I was making before at this point to uh bring this subject of adoption a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus amen what position where we are in the body of Christ do we belong a lot of times people don't feel like they belong because they don't understand what their position is a lot of people put put so much Credence on the five-fold ministry which understandably uh the position that it holds but everybody holds its own position some people major on gifts and things that they feel like they have to speak in tongues or they have to have some kind of Prophecy or something that's not necessarily A your position our position can be something as much as helping somebody amen or being there for other people or whatever position God puts us in being a good witness to other people trying to help lost souls come to Christ you know there's some people that have a really good gift of doing that uh some people get a little Tongue Tied Amen to to try to witness to other people about Jesus Christ especially sometimes uh in the message we get to the place that we want to explain all this other stuff instead of just trying to help them understand Jesus Christ amen get them to Christ yes if we get people to Christ then God Christ does the rest amen they learn and grow from there and there's people that are very gifted at that that are very good about that amen but it's finding that position I mean how many uh go into thousands of them but finding your position knowing your position look completely understanding positionally what we are in Christ sometimes I think preaching it helps reach out and uh it grabs the soul it gets the sinner to come in condemnation of the word and receiving the word but teaching teaching places a man teaching places a person positionally what they are positionally in the body of Christ and listen to this now this is the most important thing and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know who we are amen amen now what kind of importance do you put on it because we understand understand the importance that Faith plays in our religion we know and understand the the what faith plays in what we believe amen how we live we know faith is the number that's the Paramount thing if it weren't for faith we wouldn't even believe who Jesus Christ is right God Almighty veiled in flesh we wouldn't know that unless we were had unless we had faith faith to believe amen and it just goes on and on from there you can't rightly you can't rightly you're not able able to rightly have faith unless you know who you are positionally in Christ that to me makes it an extremely important thing to know an extremely important thing to understand in your life to be able to have the faith that we have to walk the walk that we walk amen not just believing who Christ is but every step we take is a step of Faith amen every breath we draw is a breath of Faith amen every the the entire life that we live is built on the foundation amen of Faith which we went through uh the the uh statue of a perfect man what's the foundation Faith you don't have faith you can't get any of the rest of them you might have portions of them little dabblings of them you like love a person here or there have a little bit of knowledge you might be able to control yourself a little bit or something but you can't rightly have these positions until faith is in your life and how can you have rightly faith unless you know who you are amen until I know that I belong in the body of Christ until I know that I have been born again until I know that God has chosen me and I've been in the mind of God before the foundation World told I know who I am in him how can I ever have faith to believe for anything else right amen especially in my life how can I ever have rightly have faith until I know what my position who I am in that body I have to know that the new birth is just the beginning that's just the start it's not your adoption your new birth is not your adoption your new birth places you in the body puts you there but where is that placement amen that's uh that's important to understand that placement where we are now let's go over to Acts chapter 2 again uh I'm not rushing this it's going to be something we're just going to take probably some extra scripture but over some things we know Amen to lay the foundation look Acts 2 uh acts two again speaking on the new birth acts 23 uh 37 and when they heard this they were pricked in a horse this is the day of Pentecost we all know Acts 2 is the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down amen filled all the house where they were sitting we pray the Lord do here for us fill all the house where they were sitting Holy Spirit Come and lit upon each of them it went into each of them amen on the day of Pentecost they come knocking out the walls as they were knocking out the walls they were speaking what the other people would listen to and think as gibberish uh didn't make any sense or speaking in another person's language in a language they didn't understand and people were looking and marbling and saying what's gotten into these people uh why are these people talking like this why are these people sounding like this what has happened to them uh they must be drunk they they must have uh they must have drunk a lot of new wine they're just drunk people that's how they're acting yeah when you get the real moving of the Holy Spirit it will make you act drunk it will make you act like you are intoxicated but they thought thought they were drunk and when they heard all that Peter said they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall praise the Lord you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you amen amen it is unto you and to your children your posterity however far long down it goes to your children and to all that are far off so they don't have to be right then right there amen like a lot of people say the only Apostles there were with the 12 apostles Apostolic age in when the TW last 12 of the 12 passed away uh the the apostolic age was introduced by Jesus Christ and I want anybody to show me anywhere in the scripture where it stopped amen amen it didn't even the apostolic age didn't even cease when they started a denomination around it that's right amen that still didn't kill it because it was still a Remnant it was still a group that came came out of that that actually believed in the apostolic experience not denomination but experience and the apostolic experience is exactly what we just read the Holy Ghost coming down on the people amen and filling all the house and moving with the Holy Spirit as the other as the Holy Spirit gave utterance it is to them it is to their children is to those that are far off it's even as many as the Lord are God shall call now how can you put a regulation on that I know people who try but you can't because it's whoever God chooses right it's whoever God wants it's not up to me it's not up to you it's not up to anybody any church any preacher nobody can say if you don't join this church if you don't come to ours if you don't believe this if you don't see it the way we do no it is many as God calls yes amen not not a pastor not a church not a denomination I don't care if you say I've been in the message 50 years I don't care it's as many as God will call yes it's up to God God does the calling and as God calls they respond as we all respond we responded to God's call as God called amen it's as many as God will call that we repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ now there's obviously no other name that we should be baptized in we know only the name of Jesus Christ I mean uh Paul said later in the scripture all that you do in word I believe it was Paul all that you do in word or indeed do in the name of Jesus Christ well what more word or deed do you get than one of the uh uh ordinances that he left us at being baptized right in the name of Jesus Christ raise now the world and denominations Satan has tried to substitute him for uh some titles of father son holy ghost or something to this effect that's probably the main popular one of their Trinity is father son Holy Ghost but you can't substitute the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you remember when brother Brandon went to that uh that place at medium or whatever it was and and U uh she she was able by her Divinity to Le levitate the table and challenged anybody to make that table go down amen you all know the story and says he says in the name of the Holy Roman Pope stood right there in the name of the President of United States stayed right there in the father son the Holy Ghost and that table stayed right there amen but when he with the authority of God spoke forth and said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that table Slamm to the ground so hard and like to broke the legs off amen amen because that's where the authority lies it doesn't lie on a title of a father or a son or a holy it lies in the name Jesus Christ that's the only place you can find it because that's the only place it'll be in the name of Jesus Christ but first repent see that's probably a lot of people have is full repentance amen repentance means Lord I'm sorry amen I didn't mean to didn't want to or don't want to act that way forgive me Lord there's true repentance it's not a stop and a continuation it's a complete 160 uh 360 turn around or 180 excuse me uh turn around and go the opposite direction yes that's repentance yes then baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Holy Ghost you shall receive a new birth that new birth comes when we obey the scripture yes justification sanctification three-step process we know justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost what as brother Ram said makes way for the person of Jesus Christ to come and live in you amen a baptism is just a submersion that's what a baptism when you're baptized you're immersed in water you're baptized with the Holy Ghost the same thing that's why we cry a lot of times Lord I give us a refilling amen it's not a refilling in your soul that that is sealed yes the Holy Spirit comes in seals the devil out it's sealed you don't get a refilling in your soul but you can sure get a refilling on this nasty thing amen you can certainly get an an an anointing refilling continually every day in your life amen you ask for it God give us a a a refilling of your anointing praise God God will do it amen you're born again you belong to him but I I I I I Need A Renewed ference in my in my life amen to obey your word and to live for you a refilling is a a is just a rean anointing amen of the holy spirit because God once he sealed you you're sealed praise the Lord You're sealed you see I I want more of God you cannot get more of God in your soul you you really honestly you can't really get more of God on you you can receive more of God Amen you you you can you can let more of God take over you amen amen say God I want more of you yeah let God take control but that's up to you God's giving you all he can give you it's what you're willing to accept and live by what what am I willing to receive Lord I I want to receive everything uh I want to let you in every door my heart I want to let you every door in my life I want you in every facet of my life amen amen in full capacity in every way amen praise the Lord amen God comes into your soul he pours it's like the Spoonful out the ocean every part of the ocean that that ocean it's not the entire ocean but every part of that ocean is now in you every part of God is now in you yes amen amen that that becomes who you are amen now we need uh that takes care of that it works on the the the soul works on the spirit begins to work on the flesh amen but then that anointing of that Spirit coming down on us just as it day on the de did on the day of Pentecost it didn't just go in them it went on them and then in them amen praise the lord we need the exact same thing yes not just in on help keep us on Lord which you lead and guide help lead and guide us into his truth that Spirit of that life now brings us into his presence amen when when say well I did on January 12th 1985 I did uh December 6 in 2004 I did way back in 1944 or whatever you want to say I did and a lot of people say that you know they're excited I receive the you I've talked to some people they could give you almost the second they say I I don't know about you friend but when I when the when the Lord filled me with his Spirit the time of the day was oblivious to me yes I couldn't have cared less what time it was must L look at my watch right when he filled me with his Spirit the day the time that was all that meant nothing to me right amen I I honestly I can I can tell you what happened I can tell you the experience I can't tell you what it was a Sunday I know that but I can't tell you what day it was I don't know what year it was uh I think it was around 1985 but I don't I don't remember for sure the time i' I've met people that tell me what time it was when they received the Holy Ghost now I don't say anything but I'm sorry I I doubt that very seriously I if you received a true genuine indwelling presence of Christ the time of day is oblivious to you that's the that's the last thing you don't get the Holy Ghost and say I wonder what time it is it doesn't brother randam said a new birth is a mess just like a natural birth a spiritual birth is a a mess amen people sometimes at the altar wherever it is slobbered crying you're a mess you don't think about getting the Holy G in that condition oh oh okay now I can tell everybody I received it my I I'm ass sure you believe the same way your your thought wasn't well you know 10 down 10 years down the road I can tell people what day it was what time it was and unless I'm just uh unique that was the last thing I thought about but I know people that have come and said oh you know and they would even challenge you if you if you don't really know the day or or or or whatever it was if you don't know the day and Daye I doubt you got it and I'm thinking if you do know I doubt you got I don't say that but I mean people have put it to the places it's like they they actually doubt you have the Holy Ghost if you can't tell them what day and time you got it like that's the last thing I thought about that that wasn't even that that wasn't in my mind and and you get the Holy Ghost friend that you don't think about what time it is amen you might can tell where you were or you know maybe approximate time or something like that but you know date time and not uh anyway that that's uh I don't see that but that's that's what we need but see even that they say well that that was an experience that you had in this flesh but when did the when did it actually take place amen actually took place before the foundation of the world Amen how many scriptures do we have to tell us that I wrote three of them down amen three scriptures down that you can go and reference to and and and realize this didn't just happen last week this didn't just happen last month this just didn't happen 20 years ago or whatever this happened before the you if you are ever God you are God's before the foundation of the world right am Revelation 138 Revelation 1778 Ephesians 1:4 before the foundation of the world he knew knew me praise God because I belong to him it was before it was before the world was ever formed I was I belong to him amen now I may have come to the knowledge of that at a certain time I may have received the experience of the new birth at a specific time but this all took place in God's mind before the foundation of the world Amen that's whose names that's where our names written on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world Amen God put them there that's why they cannot be removed remember we talked about your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life it cannot be removed from The Book of Life yes that's just a recording of every life of everyone that's ever born but the Lamb's Book of Life is a specific book of those those the the the Mind those are in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and those put on there now and I'm not looking uh I'm not looking to say a hypothetical book with George Newton Ben the Third on it that's not what I'm talking about amen I'm talking that just identifies this flesh guy I'm talking about who you are in Christ and it was before the foundation of the world who we are in Christ that brings us back to our position our place our placement where do we belong in that body what is our position in that body one of the one of the probably greatest selling Christian books I think of our time in the past 15 20 years however long it's been has probably been a purpose-driven life you probably all heard that book I've never read it you may have read it I'm assuming there's nothing wrong with the book or scripture I don't know I I agree with the title uh I think I think the title is very poignant to understand what life means to you right what purpose you have in life but I don't know I I don't know what's in the book but I don't know what it how you can know what your purpose in life is unless you know where you're positionally placed in the body right as a Christian as a true born again Christian as somebody you know just say well I play an instrument or I lead songs or I preach or I do this or I do that whatever position those are just nominal positions that's that's those are physical position that's not even a spiritual position right amen that's just a nomal it's a physical position that's that that's a whole another that's a whole another subject we're not talking about but that brings us around to understand how can we know that how can we know what drives Us in life what purpose we have what purpose we serve in life unless we know who we are in Christ you've got to know who you are what position where you're placed in the body to know who you are to be able to serve him and to live in this life amen you've got to know who you are who am I first of all that's the main thing to understand the purpose that drives your life is to understand what position you feel in the body of Christ amen they run synonymous only way you can find out but in the bo but in the body in the body of Christ we find as our spiritual growth continues we were in him in his mind before the foundation of the world yes amen amen praise the Lord I feel like I want to read those real quick let's just let's read Ephesians Ephesians 1:4 look at this anybody has any question I don't think we do but I just F to read this one now Revelation 138 and Revelation 178 speak speak also of those names uh who were in The Book of the land's book of life before the foundation of the world Ephesians one says according as he had chosen Us in him now for in him there's that's a placement yes in him is the position a placement in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless with uh without blame before him in love now I don't how you arue you can argue with the scripture all you want but right there he says he chose us before the foundation of the world yes again that's how he was able to put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life those that are his chosen amen he chose us before the foundation of the world put our names on that Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's who we are we come to a realization of it on a certain date time whatever it might be but we were always in him and if you always were in him you will be again hence the song I've been redeemed right praise God why because I was there to start with I'm going back there from a fallen condition born in sin shaped iniquity come World speaking lies back to the mind of God again amen praise the Lord I've been redeemed by his love Divine Praise the Lord now let's go over to First John first John not St John but first John chapter 5 those who may not know it's right before Revelation right before Jude right before r first John chapter 5 I was gonna want to get to two specific scriptures uh verses here but I want to start with verse one um I just F to do that whosoever first John 51 whosoever believe that Jesus believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that that loveth him that begot that uh loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him now notice the word here believeth uh that word is not just simple a carnal understanding of or having evidence to believe the devil believes Jesus Christ the devil knows who Jesus Christ is you can't deceive and confuse the Devil with a trinity because he knows better yes just like we should yes amen which we'll get into in a couple verses in a minute uh he knows better he knows who he is but if you go over to uh to St John I'm just going to go over you don't have to turn St John 1:12 but as many as received him amen as many as received him not just believed but rece received him we've gone all the reception before when you receive something to yourself it's something that you that you've taken unto yourself that you believe not not just not just believe but you actually receive to put into action it's a light and there's where the devil all of his followers probably in there I say many Christians fall short they may say they believed in Jesus but had they received him Amen to receive him is to become him to live the life of Jesus Christ to the best in our human flesh amen because we've been born again correct so this life of God lives in us so we become as we receive him we receive all that he is to receive him is to receive his word amen no doubt no disbelief you don't chop parts of it out you don't energ your own opinion and thoughts it is the word of God to receive him is to receive his word all of it amen you don't receive portions of it well I don't believe it quite like this but that's what he said uh I could tell you that the bathrooms are out that door to the right but unless you receive that you might wander out there you might go around the building well he he said it but you know I I think I I think it might be just as good to go out here you go out that door and you're in the vestibule you're like well I don't see any bathroom anywhere maybe there's a door there's a door here somewhere amen amen but if you receive what I say you're going to go through that doorm to the right right and you know what you're G to find the bathroom amen you can you can make it up in your opinion all you want you can try to interject something uh with with God in his word but he says what do he mean means right when he says it this way that's exactly what he means yes praise the Lord now you're looking and says for whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ well again we've already established we know the devil believes that Jesus is the Christ he knows that amen he's been burnt by many times he understands but as we look in St John as many as receive him receive him to them gave he power to become the sons of God praise the Lord now let's continue reading on on first John whosoever believe that Jesus is the Christ is born of God everyone that loveth him that begot loveth him that also uh uh also that is begotten of him but this we know that we love God that we love the children of God when we love God that's that's why brother R said he God would rather me love you than love him because when I'm loving you I'm loving him amen praise the Lord and and do what keep his Commandments what are his Commandments not just the 10 in Exodus 20 these are God's Commandments amen Genesis 1 to revelation 22 are God's Commandments keep his word amen amen who is supposed to keep his word those that love God yes well if you've received him there's no way but to love him yes if you've received him now you can believe on him and not love him yes amen but if you've received him unto yourself to obedience and life to the believing and receiving and and living by his word his commands is to be a what I call a Christian amen that's what a Christian is Christian is a word that means to be Christlike yes well I there's probably a lot of people that say they're Christian chrans and you look at their life and they probably in their lives couldn't be further from right amen hopefully prayerfully they're working to that they're getting to that place they're doing their best to try to shed Mr whatever Mrs whatever to gain the relationship with Jesus Christ to become Miss Jesus Christ amen but those who receive him Amen to them gave he power the authority to become sons of God we know that if we that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments praise the Lord now you don't say I believe I receive and then don't do what he says no you might as well go through that door looking for the bathroom and you might as well walk through the wall here trying to find the bathroom amen it's just as it's just as illogical amen praise the Lord now let's keep going for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous amen not not to a Christian a lot of people look at them and think that they are but they're not not if you've receiv received the Holy Ghost they're not if you've received the Holy Ghost you're born again they just become a part of life I mean living his word is no more Grievious to me than living my life because it becomes who I am am much for what for what it says whatsoever who whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith faith where do we get our faith how can we come to know that we really operate in faith because we know who we are in Christ amen we know positionally Place who we are in Christ to have what real operating faith yeah Foundation the statue of a perfect man Faith praise the Lord can't deny it friends it all comes around to the same thing who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood it is and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is true amen amen praise the Lord remember those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen praise the Lord but look at this now we get to these because this will kind of glue them together that these are the two verses I wanted to get to seventh verse for there are three that bear record in heaven they bear record where in heaven the Father the the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are what one one not three one the Father the word the logos the word is just the logos that came out of God Amen and the Holy Ghost which is just the spirit of God those that's just the spirit of God it's not a third person it's not the third person or a lesser person in the Trinity it is simply God's spirit it's that easy it's not complicated it's that easy is simply the spirit of God so the Father the word the logos that that came out of God that be the word that came that became MDC uh the the cloud by day the uh the the pillar of Fire by night uh became Jesus Christ that logos came out of God Amen remember the only begotten son the Father the word the Loos and the Holy Ghost these three are are are one amen they are one yes amen now you can't chop him up remember when brother green used to say uh talk about a testimony with the uh the the Jewish rabbis over when he go to Israel not like oh uh uh Pastor you can't chop up God and feed in the three pieces and feed him to us and and brother Green's like well uh Rabbi I I am not trying to chop your God up into three I believe he's one just like you believe amen see that help bring a cohesion it's it's not complicated amen but it takes Revelation to see a lot of people laugh these three are one now look at this eth verse and there are three that bear witness in Earth in Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one they are brought for a purpose of agreement they all three come together to serve a purpose amen the spirit the water the blood all come together they are not one but they agree in one amen it's a three-step process I like this uh that we just went over but I remember when uh Daniel made this pull pit for us and I hadn't thought of it I looked at it and I liked the cross and the way it was made uh but when brother Roger came he used it we were over on Country Club that's when that's when Daniel first made it for us and we started using it was over at Country Club and Roger first time he took it he used it he didn't have one at the time he thought how inspired and I didn't see it till later or when he told me I inspired that Daniel made three steps to the Cross oh yeah it's three steps on here to get to the Cross three steps a new birth amen justification sanctification Holy Ghost we just talked about that amen the spirit the water the blood they all agree in one they're all there to coincide for a purpose Amen in agreement they're not one amen you can be justified and not be Sanctified yes you can be justified and Sanctified and not have the Holy Ghost and be born again amen now you can have you can have an anointing and not be born again right amen because remember they only agree in one they are not one you can have an anointing you can have a state of justification amen and live in a state of justification or sanctification Luther Wesley and the message you can live in a state of justification or sanctification your life can be cleaned up and still not be born again right still not be uh had the requirements of entering into the kingdom of God which Jesus so poignantly gave to Nicodemus that we just read qualification getting into the kingdom of God was being born again amen but you have to have justification to get to sanctification you have to have justification and sanctification to get to being filled with the Holy Ghost what did Peter say on the day of Pentecost amen again repent and be baptized and you shall receive praise the Lord hallelujah amen it's a three-step process but you can you can be justified but look at look at Judas in the scripture I I don't want to go to the scripture but but in the scripture uh I believe it's John 17:17 um he he was justified in Believing on Jesus Christ Judas became one of the disciples yeah that's right he was justified Believe by Believing on Jesus Christ we just went through that he believed him received him in in so much that he followed him everywhere he went the reproach and whatever else came with it when they when when Jesus stood out there on in Matthew 10 and said go cast out the Devils speak in tongues free people from the bondage of Satan go out to house and house if if they don't receive you knock the dust off their feet and go to the next one Judas was right there but when it come to receiving the Holy Ghost and and in St John 1717 Jesus said sanctify them Father by Thy word for thy word is truth sanctify them he was justified in believing Jesus Sanctified by the word when Jesus stood there and said sanctify them but he could not go on in receiving the Holy Ghost to the day of Pentecost he sold out his Lord Jesus or he sold out Jesus he obviously wasn't his Lord but he sold out Jesus for 30 pieces of silver when hung himself right fell on his sword however amen he killed himself Judas went killed himself threw the money down didn't want the money at that part at that point and killed himself could not go on to receiving the Holy Ghost right so you can be justified you can be Sanctified the most dangerous position a Believer could be in is stuck between sanctification and filled with the Holy Ghost because your life's cleaned up you think everything's great and you know you go to church and you're part of church and but until the Holy Spirit until the life of Jesus Christ comes and makes his permanent resident in your soul amen then you fallen short short amen and yet all of that is just the beginning of our walk with Christ it's just the beginning of our it is our new birth but the beginning of where we get to being placed in that body amen of of being in the body of Christ that three-step process the three stages justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley the Holy Ghost and Pentecost and receiving the the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the person of Christ coming and living in you is that three-step process amen amen but now we're looking to the placement amen Lord willing I'm going to close here in just a second but Lord willing uh next time we'll get to the place that uh we can look at the Old Testament and the the the justification sanctification the Holy Ghost they came out of Egypt they went across the river amen and they got into the new land amen remember their Palestine is our Holy Ghost amen when we talk about that that that Promised Land our promised land is the holy spirit yes God didn't Jesus didn't come and say okay now or God and say okay now you Gentiles I give you uh between the Mississippi River and the and and the and and the uh Pacific Ocean uh and between the the Gulf of Mexico uh to the border of can I get that is your possession Gentiles go and possess God didn't give us that right we don't have a natural physical land like he gave to the children of Israel yes that was their Promised Land what was promised to us what was promised to us was that he would come back and live in US yes that is the promise that we have as Gentiles that we could be B borned again and his Spirit would live in us that is our Promised Land praise the Lord sobody say I'm going to the promised land I'm in the promised land yes praise the Lord the promised land is his Spirit his life amen but then after they got into their Promised Land God still told Joshua to divide them up and to give them their portion he still Joshua still had even on the other side of Jordan uh uh he was given instruction Joshua was given instruction to positionally place each one of the 12 tribes amen and the priesthood they still had to be positionally placed amen praise the Lord let me read this amen now you can be remember you can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost amen and not not have the Holy GH and not be born again but if you're born again you've been Anointed with the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord visible Union if you're married to Christ Christ is the word of God in St John first chapter beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God same was made flesh dwelt Among Us Christ was living was the Living Word he always was the word he is still the word he always will be the word he was the only he was only the manifestation of the attributes of God for he was the Son of God the begotten Son of God and any son of uh uh and any son or daughter any son is the attributes of their father just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy we go back in MA Hebrews tells us that amen that that Levi paid ties through Abraham when he was his great great great grandson uh grandson his granddaddy great great great amen he says even as your daddy was a young boy you were in him yet you could not have fellowship with him because you didn't know he didn't know you but then through the beaing uh breeding ground of mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father that he could have fellowship with you and so were you sons of God Sons and Daughters of God before there even was a Moon Star or molecule you were the sons and daughters of God praise the Lord for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was God in the beginning as we say in the beginning with God there was in the beginning amen eternity has no beginning so God is eternal God had no beginning but as we say God at the beginning there there was only one form of eternal life Saints and we've said that before notice there's only one form of eternal life and that's God only one form of eternal life and that was in you you didn't know anything about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested now in His image now spiritually in whose image not my daddy I'm thankful he was a born again believer but not my daddy but my father God we are now in His image praise the male and female we are in His image amen praise the Lord why because we've become as he is the spirit of God living us through Us Praise the Lord the image of God you are made you're manifested for his glory and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God God because you're an expression of his attributes and his thoughts before the foundation of the world we've said many times how could we ever claim to have eternal life God's the only form of eternal life yes correct if God's the only form of eternal life then how can I be Eternal amen because that part of who God was that he placed in me was to become him amen from before the foundation of the world that's who we all are amen now the only thing that separates us from getting to that complete that full manifestation that full Redemptive property amen is the Redemption of these bodies am amen full Redemption comes with the Redemption of this body right praise the Lord that's when we reach that full Place some people believe that you can only receive the your full place of adoption when that happens I'm sorry friend what's the point of having reached a place of full adoption when you're not here anymore right the whole point of our our full placement of adoption in the body of Christ is in how we live here now yes what good would it do you over there right I mean we will be it over there but there's there's not going to be this sticky flesh and and all that we live what's the point of that right the point of adoption is to know who we are now yes to know where we are in the body of Christ now to live our lives in that position praise the Lord you understand amen let me read this I wasn't going to read this I'm to read this one more scripture and I'm closing it is second Peter chapter 3:18 2 Peter 318 says but grow in Grace grow grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen amen praise the lord we grow in him as we learn of him as he reveals himself to us we continue to grow in him to become the very image Amen in a statue of a perfect man the very image of Jesus Christ praise the Lord let's stand if we could we'll probably get we will get more into that thought next week but Lord willing for now am we're just standing upon the promise of that word
