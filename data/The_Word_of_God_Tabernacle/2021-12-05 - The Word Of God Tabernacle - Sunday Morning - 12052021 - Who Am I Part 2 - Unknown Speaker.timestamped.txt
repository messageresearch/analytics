[16:20] prayer
[16:21] [Music]
[16:33] um there is a
[16:35] i live in a trailer court that lives
[16:37] that has lots of homeless people
[16:40] around me and they sleep in the arroyo
[16:43] and they
[16:44] and um
[16:45] and they don't congregate on the corners
[16:48] and
[16:50] and i drove by to do errands and i saw
[16:53] this
[16:55] as you know there's been a poop spreader
[16:57] around in my place and i clean it up and
[17:00] they dig another pile and it looks like
[17:02] cat or small dog and i've been watching
[17:05] it to see what if i can discern a
[17:07] pattern to it
[17:09] well then i
[17:11] as you know
[17:12] okay so then i drive by a couple days
[17:15] ago and i see this darth vader doll i
[17:17] thought it was
[17:18] an effigy that had been burned it was
[17:21] about two feet tall i didn't know what
[17:23] it was i just got out of my car didn't
[17:25] look right it looked satanic and i got
[17:28] up next to it
[17:29] and and it wasn't burned it was just
[17:32] a doll that had been that was black
[17:35] and it and it was the head of darth
[17:36] vader which is i realized represents
[17:39] satan to whoever stuck it up there and i
[17:42] realized that
[17:44] god was showing me pope is one of the
[17:47] things that satanists use
[17:49] in their
[17:51] their rights
[17:52] and i realize that my place has been
[17:55] staked out
[17:56] and there's now they're starting to
[17:58] spread it from my place over to the
[17:59] mailbox
[18:01] and which is right close to me and so i
[18:04] am asked and i talked to my neighbor who
[18:06] was a christian
[18:08] and he's backslid he's got a filthy
[18:10] mouth
[18:11] and i talked to him and i said you know
[18:13] i think this neighborhood's been hexed
[18:15] it's trying to put a hex on this place
[18:17] he says oh it's been hexed and i said
[18:20] you know what because he claimed
[18:21] christianity to me
[18:23] i said we can unhex it
[18:26] and so i'm asking the church to pray
[18:29] with me
[18:30] because this is the last day this is
[18:32] their last chance to see christ i want
[18:36] i'm asking the church if you would
[18:38] please
[18:38] join with me
[18:40] to have to take that satanic spirit and
[18:43] put it back on the devil so that these
[18:46] people can see that they that there is
[18:50] that their god is is they'll see the
[18:53] fire and that they will realize their
[18:56] god is nothing
[18:58] and and to save them this is
[19:01] their i pray that this is their mount
[19:03] carmel
[19:05] and so i'm asking the church to pray
[19:07] with me that they will lift this area up
[19:10] and and get this hex off of there and
[19:13] take it and put it right back on the
[19:15] devil
[19:16] and um and and dominic was telling me
[19:19] when he was younger he had a witch that

[19:24] back to him and she said you know your
[19:26] god is stronger than my god because

[38:06] if anybody had a testimony or a song on
[38:09] your heart
[38:16] yes i have a testimony that happened
[38:18] back in 1974 i thought
[38:21] in
[38:22] relevance to what sister matisse was
[38:25] mentioning
[38:26] i was a young christian catholic boy
[38:28] coming into the life of god's reveal
[38:30] word
[38:37] we were at 4th avenue
[38:40] and 6th street having a
[38:43] street
[38:44] service a street revival brother anthony
[38:48] was preaching his heart out and right
[38:50] across the street was a bar
[38:52] and all of a sudden four or five men
[38:55] came out of the bar and were holding
[38:57] hands and saying father son holy ghost
[39:00] father son holy ghost brother anthony
[39:03] said let's bow our heads amen and we
[39:06] pray the prayer of faith remember
[39:08] greater he that's in us
[39:10] in the world and by time it wasn't a
[39:12] long prayer but it was a prayer of faith
[39:15] and by the time we looked up it all
[39:17] disappeared
[39:18] see there's power in the name of jesus
[39:21] remember who you are yeah we have to we
[39:24] don't have to take anything the devil
[39:26] wants amen yes sir brother praise the
[39:29] lord so true
[39:31] amen reminds me of that story brother
[39:32] brad i'm told where he went to that
[39:34] lady with that medium and she lifted the
[39:36] table up off the floor and said i
[39:38] challenged anybody to put that table on
[39:40] the floor men got up and shoved on it
[39:42] pushed on it table wouldn't move
[39:45] and she said i challenge anybody
[39:48] you come up and said
[39:50] he would do it
[39:51] he said go right ahead he said in the
[39:52] name of the holy
[39:54] catholic pope and it stayed right there
[39:57] in the name of father son the holy ghost
[39:58] has stayed right there but he said in
[40:00] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[40:03] that table cracked down to the ground so
[40:05] hard like broke the legs
[40:08] praise the lord amen that's the lord
[40:10] that's that's the power and prayer power
[40:13] in the name of jesus amen yeah praise
[40:15] the lord anybody else
[40:17] you have songs
[40:19] micah had a song you wanted to sing
[40:22] amen
[40:34] um
[40:35] this thing this song came on my heart
[40:37] last week
[40:41] because i know there are several people
[40:43] whether it's financial or
[40:46] in body or in mind that are sick
[40:50] or not well
[40:51] um
[40:52] and on the lines that our pastors spoke
[40:56] that sometimes we're provided by the
[40:59] things we do
[41:00] by our hands by the choices we make
[41:03] um and this song came from my mind
[41:06] killing my heart
[41:07] um
[41:09] along those lines and so if you know it
[41:11] feel free to sing the words will be up
[41:14] um
[41:16] and i hope it's a blessing to you
[41:22] [Music]
[41:31] waiting there for 38 years he cried so
[41:35] long
[41:36] he ran out of tears just a worn-out man
[41:41] looking for a healing hand
[41:47] then one day his chance came along a
[41:50] healing man who could make him strong
[41:53] and he caught his eyes
[41:56] but his question took him by surprise

[47:04] our spirit to surrender all to you but
[47:07] we know lord and recognizes born-again
[47:09] holy ghost-filled christians as the only
[47:12] way that we're ever going to get
[47:13] anywhere with you lord is to surrender
[47:15] our lives and to surrender our
[47:17] everything to you lord our will and our
[47:19] abilities and our thoughts and
[47:21] everything god is in your hands let it
[47:23] be manipulated let it be changed let it

[47:28] perfect will whatever that might be for
[47:30] every one of us
[47:32] lord i pray that you bless this service
[47:34] lord and reigning part of it we rebuke
[47:35] every demonic spirit of hell that would
[47:38] try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this
[47:40] service in any way that you would get
[47:42] the glory and the honor of the praise
[47:43] for all that is said and done
[47:45] help me lord insufficient as i am god
[47:49] lord i
[47:50] you know how i labored my mind
[47:52] lord in my heart and my spirit to
[47:55] lord get to the place that
[47:57] this this could uh come to my heart real
[48:00] and and bring it in a way lord that it
[48:03] would be revealed to each one of us and
[48:05] then you showed me that it's not based
[48:07] on my ability it's based on you lord so
[48:10] lord as it is spoken today may you
[48:12] reveal it to us as you have through your
[48:14] word through your prophet that god we
[48:17] would receive today the truth of what
[48:19] you have for us in our lives well thank
[48:22] you father for all of it and pray that
[48:24] your holy spirit would have preeminence
[48:25] once again now in the lovely precious
[48:28] name of our lord and savior jesus christ
[48:30] we pray
[48:31] amen amen
[48:33] saint john chapter 3 verse 13
[48:37] no math has ended up to heaven but he
[48:39] that came down from heaven even the son
[48:41] of man which is in heaven
[48:43] as moses lifted up the serpent in the
[48:45] wilderness even so must the son of man
[48:48] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[48:50] him should not perish but have
[48:52] eternal life
[48:54] for god so loved the world that he gave
[48:56] his only begotten son that whosoever
[48:58] believeth in him should not perish but
[49:01] have everlasting life
[49:03] for god sent not his son into the world
[49:05] to condemn the world but that the world
[49:06] through him might be saved he that
[49:09] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[49:11] that believeth not is condemned already
[49:14] because he hath not believed on in the
[49:16] name of the only begotten son of god
[49:19] this is the condemnation that light has
[49:21] come into the world and men loved
[49:23] darkness rather than light because their
[49:26] deeds were evil
[49:28] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[49:30] light neither cometh to the light lest
[49:32] his deeds should be reproved but he that
[49:35] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[49:37] his deeds may be made manifest that they
[49:40] are wrought in god
[49:42] you could be seated if you'd like
[49:45] amen i'm gonna continue this so this
[49:48] would be i guess who am i part two
[49:50] the men of those who may have been here
[49:52] last week or streaming last week uh
[49:54] we'll just continue with this part on uh
[49:57] who am i
[49:59] this would be part two we started out
[50:00] this uh with saint john chapter three
[50:03] one of the more familiar scripture
[50:05] readings that we have of the scripture
[50:06] at least it is for me because like i
[50:08] said last week i grew up in a baptist
[50:10] church and as you go to a sunday school
[50:12] in a baptist church first set of the
[50:14] first uh uh
[50:16] a scripture that they teach you that you
[50:18] have to learn that you have to quote and
[50:20] and
[50:21] and uh my heart is is john 3 16 for god
[50:25] so loved the world he gave his only
[50:26] begotten son see it it worked
[50:29] my whole life from seven eight years old
[50:33] i could quote that scripture and i can
[50:34] quote it today i don't have to read it i
[50:36] know exactly what it says right so it
[50:38] worked amen the only thing is that it
[50:41] took god to bring it into my heart and
[50:43] change my life that's where the
[50:45] difference is amen
[50:47] but
[50:48] uh verse 15 again is the thing i want to
[50:50] focus on the most today and i'm not
[50:53] going to background very much and i'm
[50:54] going to try to keep it as short as
[50:56] possible i don't want to wear you out
[50:57] and and i know our bodies get tired and
[51:00] uh kind of had a rough thirsty
[51:02] well-rinsed thursday tuesday wednesday
[51:05] thursday
[51:06] friday myself and uh we were pretty busy
[51:08] yesterday and this morning uh but uh but
[51:12] god gives us strength and i'm so
[51:14] thankful for that his and his anointing
[51:17] is here i feel his presence amen brother
[51:19] john you feel that presence john
[51:21] couldn't hardly sing that last song
[51:23] amen praise the lord so amen amen we
[51:26] know the spirit of god is here but i
[51:28] want to focus again on that 15th verse
[51:30] that whosoever believeth in him should
[51:32] not perish but have eternal life and
[51:34] again to get to that point of eternal
[51:37] life is what we're talking about because
[51:39] if we're wanting to and we're expecting
[51:41] to have eternal life we've got to
[51:44] understand or there's got to be that
[51:45] revelation that there's only one form of
[51:48] eternal life and it's not you and it's
[51:50] not me
[51:51] it's not our spirit it's not our
[51:53] it's not our flesh it's it's that part
[51:56] of god who we who god saw us before the
[51:59] foundation of the world because the only
[52:01] thing that's eternal is god god is the
[52:03] only form of eternity that there is so
[52:06] if he's the only form of eternity that
[52:08] there is then only those that came from
[52:11] god or a part of god are the ones that
[52:14] are eternal and only that part of god
[52:16] that came from god is eternal yeah so we
[52:19] got to this part that we went to last
[52:21] week and i've done this many uh many
[52:24] times the church i don't know that we'll
[52:26] be uh touching on it very much sorry
[52:28] sister norma we
[52:29] kind of
[52:30] have a
[52:32] range of people around from point to
[52:35] point it would probably be better i
[52:36] guess if it was on the wall i might do
[52:38] that anyway
[52:39] uh with our trial being uh our body
[52:42] spirit soul as you know uh many times in
[52:45] brother branham's early ministry he he
[52:47] kind of uh would equate the body spirit
[52:50] soul and in different ways he would uh
[52:52] he would just uh mention body soul
[52:54] spirit body spirit soul soul spirit body
[52:57] that kind of thing but when brother
[52:58] branham broke it down to teaching the
[53:01] actuality of what is uh what the human
[53:03] is made up of he broke it down to the
[53:06] body first we see of course the spirit
[53:09] and then the soul
[53:10] soul is the innermost man
[53:12] the wheel inside the wheel the innermost
[53:14] being is the soul who is really you
[53:16] spirit is just the life of the body and
[53:18] the body of course that we see is that's
[53:20] the pretty that's pretty easy part but
[53:22] down inside the soul now that's the real
[53:24] you that's who you really are is that
[53:27] part that god before the foundation of
[53:29] the world put in there as a soul a
[53:32] person that would live on that would
[53:33] continue on after this body uh had
[53:37] deceased that that soul would continue
[53:39] to live on and that's the real you
[53:41] that's who you really are but that seed
[53:44] that god placed down in there is that
[53:46] part of who god is and who you really
[53:50] are is that seed the seed of god
[53:53] now let's go back to first john and and
[53:56] uh read in the scripture there again as
[53:58] we left that off with last week
[54:00] first john chapter 3
[54:04] not saint john but first john chapter 3.
[54:09] i prayed yesterday and
[54:12] well always pray but i sitting right
[54:14] where brother john said and i was asking
[54:16] the lord
[54:17] some better way lord that
[54:19] that
[54:21] i i feel so insufficient but a way to be
[54:24] able to relate
[54:26] that uh to us to be able to see that
[54:28] because
[54:30] it's hard
[54:32] i i recognize i i'm not a very
[54:35] intelligent person but i can recognize
[54:38] that if i have a difficult time grasping
[54:40] something then most other people
[54:42] probably do too yeah
[54:44] so when it's something that's like that
[54:46] in my spirit
[54:48] and i i in my spirit feel
[54:51] insufficient
[54:52] in sharing that i asked the lord for
[54:55] help he's always asking for help anyway
[54:57] but you know there's just some things
[54:58] that you that's just challenging to get
[55:01] across
[55:02] to understand or to to have that
[55:04] revelation of and sometimes it just
[55:06] takes that little thing to click
[55:08] to bring that revelation to your heart
[55:10] right amen and that's that's what the
[55:12] lord does sometimes the lord will just
[55:14] drop a revelation to you but usually
[55:16] it's something that's spoken because the
[55:18] word brings faith preaching of the word
[55:20] brings faith faith comes by hearing
[55:22] hearing the word of god so what many
[55:24] times when that word comes and that word
[55:27] is spoken
[55:28] just a certain way or a certain time or
[55:30] something would just click in that
[55:31] revelational comments it's just the
[55:33] nature of the holy spirit that reveals
[55:36] that work to us that that brings it and
[55:38] make it known to us so it becomes a part
[55:40] of us so after that part there's no
[55:42] denying that revelation
[55:44] it just becomes a part of who you are
[55:46] amen so
[55:48] uh
[55:49] talking to the lord about that because
[55:51] to get us to the place to understand
[55:53] this is not us
[55:55] this body is not us
[55:58] this spirit is not uh it's not the real
[56:00] you
[56:01] again those are just
[56:02] houses that god houses in well the house
[56:05] is the body the spirit's just the life
[56:06] of the body uh the the the imagination
[56:10] constant reason fixed uh affection
[56:12] memory it's just the spirit it's just
[56:14] the life of the body but the real you is
[56:16] what's down on the inside of the inside
[56:18] the eternal part and that's the part
[56:21] again from last week i want to focus on
[56:24] again today is that eternal part if we
[56:27] expect and believe to have eternal life
[56:30] then we have to come to the recognized
[56:33] recognition of who we really are
[56:37] hence the title who am i
[56:39] who we really are who we really are is
[56:42] not flesh
[56:44] it's a representation of god because of
[56:46] the spirit that's now living within us
[56:48] but the real us is down on the inside of
[56:51] the inside
[56:52] that part that came from god
[56:54] that's who we really are the part that
[56:56] came from god
[56:59] in this country
[57:00] i'm going to try to make it a little
[57:01] plainer it helped me yesterday anyway
[57:04] you know in the united states we have
[57:06] something like patent law
[57:08] uh brother peter mcfadden is a patent
[57:11] lawyer now
[57:12] we have things called patents
[57:14] that if it's something that you've made
[57:17] or manufactured
[57:19] you can put a patent on that in this
[57:21] country and nobody else can duplicate
[57:25] that widget without your permission
[57:28] it's yours
[57:29] we have what's called intelligent uh
[57:32] intellectual property you've ever heard
[57:34] of that
[57:35] we have what's called intellectual
[57:37] property in this country so if it's
[57:40] something that was a thought
[57:42] or an idea
[57:43] or usually it's used for a book
[57:46] intellectual property a lot of times is
[57:48] used for a manuscript or a book if
[57:50] somebody wrote a book and had original
[57:53] thoughts those thoughts put in paper you
[57:56] have a uh what is an intellectual
[57:59] property that that says in this country
[58:02] if you go to the court and say this is
[58:04] my book and i've got this copyright and
[58:06] this this is my intellectual property
[58:09] that means that nobody else can take it
[58:12] from you
[58:13] nobody else can duplicate it nobody else
[58:16] is even supposed to repeat it without
[58:18] your permission
[58:20] now people obviously do all the time
[58:23] but they're not supposed to rewrite it
[58:26] uh that's called perjury right there are
[58:28] uh uh plagiarism
[58:31] they're not supposed to uh
[58:33] repeat it
[58:34] they're not supposed to use it for any
[58:36] personal gain
[58:38] because it's your intellectual property
[58:41] it came from your spirit
[58:44] it came from your thoughts
[58:46] it came from your mind so even though
[58:49] it's out here it belongs to you
[58:53] in this country it's considered a part
[58:57] of you
[58:58] amen
[58:59] i i i well the lord helped me write a
[59:02] book that that book is copyrighted
[59:06] in that book is intellectual property
[59:09] that god gave to me
[59:11] that dropped in my mind the spirit that
[59:13] i put on that book
[59:14] and so nobody can take that and
[59:17] replicate it without my permission
[59:19] legally people do it of course but
[59:21] legally they're not supposed to take
[59:23] that book and preach on it legally
[59:26] without my permission now they can i
[59:28] don't care
[59:30] they're welcome to do that all they want
[59:31] but they they're not legally supposed to
[59:34] without asking my permission because
[59:37] that book is a part of me
[59:40] you understand where i'm going
[59:42] even though the book is over it on my
[59:44] desk or in a printer somewhere or in a
[59:46] computer somewhere it's my intellectual
[59:49] property so it belongs to me
[59:52] it's an extension of me
[59:55] i hope we can grab you you see where i'm
[59:56] going with this
[59:58] we are the intellectual property of god
[1:00:03] even though we're out from him per se in
[1:00:07] his thoughts our minds brother adam
[1:00:09] always said we're the thoughts of god
[1:00:11] attribute of god you're an attribute of
[1:00:13] god that's an easy way to put it it's an
[1:00:15] easy way to understand it to say that we
[1:00:18] were in the mind of god we were the
[1:00:20] thoughts of god we were an attribute of
[1:00:22] god well saints if we were a thought of
[1:00:24] god and god took that thought and
[1:00:27] expressed it down inside you in the form
[1:00:30] of a germ seed of life
[1:00:33] then that's still god's intellectual
[1:00:36] property
[1:00:37] that still belongs to god that is as
[1:00:40] much a part of god as if you were
[1:00:42] standing here in a corporal body right
[1:00:44] now right now
[1:00:46] it's still just as much a part of god
[1:00:48] now as it was then
[1:00:50] because god took that and he put it down
[1:00:53] i put my thoughts in a book on paper
[1:00:56] god took his thoughts and he put them in
[1:00:58] you and in you and in you and in you and
[1:01:02] in you and if you're streaming he put it
[1:01:04] in each one of his own predestinated
[1:01:07] children
[1:01:09] that's why that becomes who we really
[1:01:12] are
[1:01:13] god's intellectual property
[1:01:16] because we belong to him
[1:01:18] that's who you really are
[1:01:20] amen not not this uh person uh born in
[1:01:23] the bennett family and and and the
[1:01:25] things that god give me in the stature
[1:01:27] and
[1:01:28] my look and my ethnicity and all that no
[1:01:31] that's just a part of who this house is
[1:01:33] but who i really am is on the inside of
[1:01:36] the inside that germ seed that god put
[1:01:38] in before the foundation of the world
[1:01:40] very much that's who we really are yes
[1:01:42] god's intellectual property
[1:01:45] praise the lord that's wonderful
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:49] it's just the thoughts of god think
[1:01:52] about this i mentioned this the other
[1:01:53] day last sunday
[1:01:55] you know i got a couple of extensions of
[1:01:57] myself here
[1:01:58] my son newton jr or we called him micah
[1:02:02] uh
[1:02:03] my daughter there's extensions they came
[1:02:05] from me
[1:02:06] well let's go on the script before we go
[1:02:08] to first john let's go to let's go to
[1:02:10] hebrews
[1:02:12] amen i'm just trying to follow the lord
[1:02:14] it's it's not following the path i was
[1:02:16] expecting but let's go to hebrews
[1:02:23] hebrews chapter 7.
[1:02:25] maybe we can nail this down just a
[1:02:27] little more
[1:02:28] scripturally
[1:02:32] hebrews chapter 7 verse 1
[1:02:37] for this melchizedek king of salem
[1:02:40] priest of the most high god who met
[1:02:42] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:02:44] the kings and blessed him
[1:02:46] to whom also abraham gave a tenth
[1:02:49] of all
[1:02:51] abraham tied to god
[1:02:54] no cassidy
[1:02:55] abraham tithed to melchizedek amen to
[1:03:00] god
[1:03:01] first being by interpretation king of
[1:03:03] righteousness and after that also king
[1:03:05] of salem which is king of peace
[1:03:08] without father without mother without
[1:03:10] descent having neither beginning of days
[1:03:13] nor ending of life and again that just
[1:03:15] blows that baffles me
[1:03:17] but may like unto the son of god
[1:03:20] abideth the priest continually
[1:03:22] now consider how great this man
[1:03:25] unto whom even the patriarch abraham
[1:03:28] gave the tenth of his
[1:03:30] of his spoils of his of the spoil
[1:03:33] and verily they that are of the sons of
[1:03:36] levi who receive the office of
[1:03:38] priesthood of the priesthood have a
[1:03:40] commandment to take ties of the people
[1:03:44] according to the law that is of their
[1:03:46] brethren though they come out of the
[1:03:48] loins of abraham
[1:03:50] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:03:52] them received tithes of abraham and
[1:03:56] blessed him that had the promises you
[1:03:58] see how this is all intertwined together
[1:04:02] amen just like god and his family
[1:04:05] it's it's all intertwined together we're
[1:04:07] all we're all uh we're all an extension
[1:04:11] of that very thing
[1:04:13] amen we always talk about brother tom
[1:04:15] mentioned in his prayer of getting
[1:04:16] together with those of like precious
[1:04:18] faith the scripture tells us basically
[1:04:20] what it is it's a family gathering right
[1:04:23] we got a little portion of a family
[1:04:25] reunion going on here because we all
[1:04:27] came from the same daddy
[1:04:29] we all came from the same papa we were
[1:04:31] all of the thoughts of god expressed in
[1:04:35] these flesh bodies that we're sitting
[1:04:36] here today with yes amen look at this
[1:04:39] now and without all contradiction the
[1:04:42] less is better uh less is blessed the
[1:04:44] better and here men that die
[1:04:47] receive tithes but there they uh he
[1:04:49] receiveth them of whom is witness that
[1:04:52] he liveth
[1:04:53] and as it and as i may so say levi also
[1:04:57] who received tithes paid tithes in
[1:05:00] abraham
[1:05:03] levi
[1:05:05] it was accounted in the mind of god in
[1:05:07] the recognition of god
[1:05:10] it was accounted to levi
[1:05:13] to that paid tithes to melchizedek which
[1:05:17] abraham did
[1:05:19] because abraham because levi was still
[1:05:22] yet in the loins of abraham
[1:05:25] praise the lord amen
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:30] you
[1:05:33] you see how just even in
[1:05:36] the natural
[1:05:38] and my loins existed my son my daughter
[1:05:41] my grandson sitting there
[1:05:44] amen yeah
[1:05:46] you see through that
[1:05:48] extension
[1:05:50] how god even attributed it to levi
[1:05:54] empantized to melchizedek
[1:05:56] through abraham
[1:06:00] that lineage
[1:06:02] well if that extends in the natural what
[1:06:06] does it do in the spiritual
[1:06:08] god himself you're just that extension
[1:06:12] you're just that one that came from the
[1:06:15] loins of god almighty that came from his
[1:06:19] thoughts his you're an attribute of his
[1:06:22] expressed here
[1:06:25] praise the lord amen
[1:06:27] and there's
[1:06:28] no way
[1:06:30] that my son
[1:06:32] could deny that i am his father
[1:06:35] all right no way right
[1:06:38] he could change his name
[1:06:40] he could go to the course and get
[1:06:42] emancipated of course he's 31. now he's
[1:06:44] not just a little late for that
[1:06:46] but he could go to the courts as a young
[1:06:48] man and emancipated himself legally
[1:06:52] for me being his daddy
[1:06:55] but all you got to do is a little a
[1:06:57] little swab of my saliva and his and
[1:06:59] you'll find out i'm his papa
[1:07:01] no denying it right do the blood test
[1:07:05] they call it of course dna today but
[1:07:08] you're doing blood tests you'll find out
[1:07:09] real quick he's my son
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:12] what did the scripture say what did
[1:07:14] brother branham say
[1:07:16] do the word test give them the word test
[1:07:19] and you'll find out real quick whether
[1:07:20] they belong to god or not yes
[1:07:23] you'll find out very fast you just do a
[1:07:25] little test do a blood test because his
[1:07:28] royal blood now flows through my veins
[1:07:30] just do a little blood test a little
[1:07:32] word test and you'll find out real fast
[1:07:35] who i belong to
[1:07:36] there won't be any denying it used to be
[1:07:38] a day when i did deny him i didn't want
[1:07:41] to have anything to do with him but i
[1:07:43] still belong to him because that seed
[1:07:45] was still in there
[1:07:47] it was always in there always been in
[1:07:49] there i've had people challenge me said
[1:07:51] oh it was it was put there when you were
[1:07:53] born again it was put there when you
[1:07:55] received the word it was put there
[1:07:56] someone said no no no
[1:07:58] not according to the scripture and not
[1:08:00] according to the message right of course
[1:08:02] the message is just an extension of the
[1:08:04] scripture right amen
[1:08:06] it was always there that's who i always
[1:08:10] was
[1:08:10] right i never was a dog turned into a
[1:08:13] cat
[1:08:14] i never was a mule turned into a a horse
[1:08:19] i was oh i never i never was a wheat
[1:08:21] turned into a tear or vice versa i was
[1:08:24] always a son or daughter of god i was
[1:08:27] always
[1:08:29] this seed
[1:08:31] in you you were always
[1:08:33] this always no matter where you were
[1:08:35] going how much you denied it what you
[1:08:37] tried to get away from it that made no
[1:08:40] difference you belong to god then you
[1:08:42] belong to god now that's why that jesus
[1:08:45] said all the father hath given me will
[1:08:47] come and satan cannot remove one from
[1:08:50] the bottom of my head can't do it
[1:08:52] because we belong to him
[1:08:55] why do we belong to him because we have
[1:08:56] eternal life how do we have eternal life
[1:08:58] because we are him
[1:09:02] that seed is him
[1:09:05] that seed is you well if it's you and
[1:09:07] him
[1:09:08] it's like people try to chop god up into
[1:09:10] three pieces
[1:09:12] they try to make him a father and then a
[1:09:14] son and a holy ghost and you got the
[1:09:17] trinity going on which is not scriptural
[1:09:19] at all and they got god chopped up into
[1:09:21] three pieces and and god's the one and
[1:09:24] the
[1:09:25] jesus the son and the holy spirit
[1:09:28] and and and
[1:09:29] brother random come and said well now
[1:09:31] the bible says in many places that god
[1:09:33] is the father of jesus jesus himself
[1:09:35] said
[1:09:36] and then you go and you find out when
[1:09:38] when mary conceived that she was
[1:09:40] conceived of who
[1:09:42] the holy ghost was you split these two
[1:09:45] up what did you got
[1:09:47] you got an illegitimate religion friend
[1:09:49] you got a mess
[1:09:51] if you try to chop god in the holy ghost
[1:09:53] into two different pieces and then the
[1:09:55] sun out here you chop them all up then
[1:09:57] what have you got some illegitimate
[1:09:59] but when the
[1:10:00] when god and the holy ghost are the
[1:10:02] self-sane person
[1:10:04] then it's it's very simple amen well
[1:10:07] when you've got the holy spirit and that
[1:10:09] seed of god is the self-saying person
[1:10:11] what have you got
[1:10:13] well if that that seed is you and that
[1:10:15] seed came from god then what have you
[1:10:18] got
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:20] self same person
[1:10:23] yes amen
[1:10:25] it's hard for us to recognize i know
[1:10:27] your flesh gets in the way saints i
[1:10:29] understand that because it does me too
[1:10:32] it wants to make me doubt all the time
[1:10:35] satan wants to point out every mistake i
[1:10:37] made every failure that i made
[1:10:39] everything that i said wrong every
[1:10:41] thought that i said wrong you know satan
[1:10:43] will drop a nasty filthy thought into
[1:10:45] your mind and
[1:10:47] and keep it long enough in there to
[1:10:48] convince you it was your thought
[1:10:51] you'll be repenting for a thought that
[1:10:53] god that satan put in there that you had
[1:10:55] nothing to do with
[1:10:57] you cast that devil out and let god take
[1:11:00] preeminent in that thought and then
[1:11:02] that's the then that lays on the head of
[1:11:04] satan not you
[1:11:06] amen amen what did brother greene say he
[1:11:08] said as soon as you can get a hold of
[1:11:09] yourself
[1:11:10] right or brother adam told him that
[1:11:12] right as soon as you can come to
[1:11:13] yourself soon as you can get a hold of
[1:11:14] yourself say god i don't want to be that
[1:11:16] way i'm not like that lord forgive me
[1:11:18] i'm sorry you got to go to somebody and
[1:11:21] make it right with them apologize to
[1:11:23] them or whatever then you make that
[1:11:24] right and then you move on and that's
[1:11:26] that's the christian way of doing it
[1:11:28] yeah
[1:11:29] i'm going to say something
[1:11:31] i wasn't going to and i'm not preaching
[1:11:33] this as doctor
[1:11:34] but as i was praying the lord yesterday
[1:11:38] and just so many things was coming to me
[1:11:40] i i started thinking god is is is
[1:11:43] repentance for us
[1:11:47] i mean think about it
[1:11:48] if this is who you are
[1:11:51] and this is who you always have been if
[1:11:53] this seed
[1:11:54] is who you are and it's who you always
[1:11:56] have been
[1:11:59] forgiveness is already inherent
[1:12:04] you're already forgiven right jesus hung
[1:12:07] at calvary and said it is finished the
[1:12:08] work of the
[1:12:10] the work of forgiveness is done
[1:12:13] repentance is for us
[1:12:16] amen it's not for him it's for us
[1:12:20] it's for us to recognize who we are
[1:12:23] to give us faith
[1:12:25] to help us recognize lord i'm sorry we
[1:12:28] make a mistake see god gave us an avenue
[1:12:33] to be able to reach that place in our
[1:12:36] hearts and in our spirits that we
[1:12:38] recognize god has forgiven us
[1:12:42] amen otherwise we'll just we'll just run
[1:12:44] around this earth as guilt-ridden people
[1:12:48] oh we'll just be a bunch of guilt-ridden
[1:12:50] people unless god gave us an avenue
[1:12:54] god gave us a vehicle to unload all that
[1:12:57] guilt
[1:12:59] to unload all that oppression and all
[1:13:01] that weight sin is a weight you know
[1:13:03] that right you sin and sin will weigh
[1:13:06] you down it keeps you so weighed down
[1:13:08] and like mike is saying people get so
[1:13:10] comfortable in those places
[1:13:13] they get so comfortable living in that
[1:13:14] sin they get so comfortable living in
[1:13:16] that sickness any attention and all
[1:13:18] those things they get so comfortable
[1:13:20] like that they don't even want out
[1:13:21] anymore
[1:13:24] but there's
[1:13:25] there god provided a vehicle for us
[1:13:29] to lift that off of us
[1:13:31] the fact of the matter is if this is you
[1:13:34] it's you then it's you now always will
[1:13:37] be you
[1:13:38] that's established that's finished
[1:13:41] there's no debate or question to that
[1:13:44] if you came as an attribute a part of
[1:13:46] god you are now you always will be you
[1:13:49] came from eternity and you're going to
[1:13:52] eternity
[1:13:53] i don't know any other better way to say
[1:13:54] it brother graham says beginning many
[1:13:56] times i say beginning many times but
[1:13:58] friend there never was a beginning
[1:14:01] it never began
[1:14:02] it just always was
[1:14:04] if he always was you always were
[1:14:07] you came from him
[1:14:09] and forgiveness repentance is a vehicle
[1:14:13] god gave us how we recognize of course
[1:14:16] that we've faults and mistakes
[1:14:18] is a vehicle to unload all that
[1:14:21] to get that off of our spirits to get
[1:14:23] rid of that and answer that it doesn't
[1:14:25] burden you anymore so that you can have
[1:14:27] the faith that you need to be the type
[1:14:29] of christian and godly person with that
[1:14:31] experience in your life that you need to
[1:14:33] be
[1:14:35] what would you be without it
[1:14:38] well i'm just so and so and such and
[1:14:40] such no you're not amen no you're not
[1:14:44] but as i said last week but i'm not just
[1:14:47] a sinner saved by grace either
[1:14:51] i love that song like i told you last
[1:14:53] week i i really enjoyed that song the
[1:14:55] gates are singing just as sinners say by
[1:14:57] grace i like it but the truth of it is
[1:15:00] if you are truly a son of god from the
[1:15:02] beginning a seed of god
[1:15:04] you always work
[1:15:06] you're the predestinated thought of god
[1:15:09] not just a sinner saved by his grace
[1:15:11] yeah we are sinners saved by his grace
[1:15:13] but not just a sinner saved by grace we
[1:15:15] were always this we were always that
[1:15:18] seed
[1:15:20] we're that part of god that god put in
[1:15:21] these flesh bodies so
[1:15:23] that that exists because it is give them
[1:15:25] the word test you'll find out who they
[1:15:27] are real quick yes amen if they'll stand
[1:15:29] on that word brother braham said even if
[1:15:31] that they stand on that message of the
[1:15:32] hour you give them the word test you'll
[1:15:34] find out whether they really are or not
[1:15:37] give them a dna test give my children a
[1:15:39] dna test you'll find out real quick they
[1:15:41] belong to me
[1:15:42] they're my papa i'm their pop and they
[1:15:45] can't deny that
[1:15:46] no matter how much or how legal they try
[1:15:48] to do it doesn't matter they belong to
[1:15:50] me amen
[1:15:53] so many people we
[1:15:54] look friends uh
[1:15:56] they try to deny it sometimes but you
[1:15:58] just can't do it in the loins of abraham
[1:16:00] just like levi was
[1:16:03] in the loins of
[1:16:05] abraham
[1:16:08] by paying tithes to melchizedek
[1:16:10] it's just an extension of him
[1:16:13] praise the lord just an extension
[1:16:18] we're an extension of god
[1:16:22] that's simply to
[1:16:23] simply
[1:16:24] put we are the extensions of god yes we
[1:16:27] are
[1:16:28] if we're his children if we're the
[1:16:30] predestinated of god if we're the four
[1:16:32] known of god from the thoughts of god
[1:16:34] that we are his intellectual property
[1:16:37] he we belong to him because we're part
[1:16:40] of him
[1:16:41] not because we repented not because we
[1:16:43] came to an altar not because we accepted
[1:16:46] him or not said he's my savior not even
[1:16:48] because you become born again
[1:16:51] i won't get to it today i got a quote in
[1:16:53] here it tells you that's just a temporal
[1:16:54] gift from god the holy spirit
[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:59] we'll try to explain that later but
[1:17:01] that's exactly what he said
[1:17:03] but what it boils down to is
[1:17:06] this was always you
[1:17:08] first john let's go to first john again
[1:17:11] now
[1:17:12] let's find this seed again
[1:17:18] not saint john now first john
[1:17:20] first john chapter well we'll just start
[1:17:22] with verse one again
[1:17:29] praise the lord
[1:17:31] mine
[1:17:32] i tell you what that it just that just
[1:17:34] does something to me
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:37] when you when you hear
[1:17:39] when you read the bible talk about it
[1:17:41] you hear brother brown and preach about
[1:17:42] it or something anyhow there's preach it
[1:17:45] it it it does something to you but my
[1:17:48] when it just becomes such a revelation
[1:17:50] and drops down in your heart right that
[1:17:52] really
[1:17:53] like i said last week brother adam said
[1:17:54] if this flesh were to drop off you see
[1:17:56] god standing in front of you right
[1:17:58] why because that seed came to life
[1:18:01] because of the holy spirit coming in
[1:18:03] there
[1:18:04] that that's that's exactly why that when
[1:18:07] you're born again and that the holy
[1:18:09] spirit comes into your soul and god
[1:18:11] seals that spirit in that soul and
[1:18:14] there's nothing can get in or nothing
[1:18:16] can get out
[1:18:18] you know you talk about
[1:18:20] i'm
[1:18:21] i want to go here
[1:18:23] people talk about and brother brown did
[1:18:25] about getting a refilling
[1:18:27] a refilling of the spirit
[1:18:30] what is that refilling
[1:18:32] friends if you've been born again
[1:18:34] and the holy spirit of god has took over
[1:18:37] residence of your soul and when that
[1:18:39] life
[1:18:41] met that seed life
[1:18:43] it brought life amen when it's sealed in
[1:18:46] there nothing can get in and nothing can
[1:18:49] get out right now until it gets to its
[1:18:51] destination
[1:18:53] then where is the refilling that we get
[1:18:56] that guy is settled
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] that soul man is done he's sealed until
[1:19:03] his destination that's scripture
[1:19:05] ephesians 1 12 i believe
[1:19:08] or 14 something like that
[1:19:10] that that's done
[1:19:12] so where's the refeeling coming to
[1:19:15] it's his spirit of an anointing upon the
[1:19:17] body and the spirit
[1:19:19] because the soul is completely
[1:19:23] it's already sealed
[1:19:25] the soul seal
[1:19:27] god's god's not still just pouring more
[1:19:29] of his spirit in there no what we need
[1:19:33] is more of his life to take over our
[1:19:35] spirit and our bodies
[1:19:37] so that we live and act and do more like
[1:19:41] christ every day
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:45] his spirit upon us
[1:19:48] that anointing that fresh refilling of
[1:19:50] an anointing upon us
[1:19:53] i know that's not salvation but that's
[1:19:56] also the vehicle which god give us to
[1:19:58] fill his presence in our lives
[1:20:01] amen that anointing that comment falls
[1:20:04] that that fell today this year now
[1:20:07] you may feel it now that that anointing
[1:20:09] that's on you
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:11] praise it that's a that's a refeeling
[1:20:13] that god comes and anoints once again
[1:20:16] soul sealed it's sealed till it's
[1:20:19] destination
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:21] no changing that brother and said he's
[1:20:24] sealed and sealed in nothing get in
[1:20:26] nothing get out he talked about the
[1:20:27] train car mentioned before here a couple
[1:20:29] weeks ago man talked about the train car
[1:20:31] where uh when it when it was packed
[1:20:34] right and everything was exactly the way
[1:20:35] it was supposed to be and everything was
[1:20:37] supposed to be in it's in it the
[1:20:38] inspector would come by he would look in
[1:20:40] the train car to make sure everything
[1:20:42] was packed right everything was supposed
[1:20:43] to be in it's in it he'd close the door
[1:20:45] and he put a seal on that door
[1:20:48] and there was nobody gonna change or
[1:20:50] break that seal until that train got to
[1:20:52] his destination right until that box car
[1:20:55] got through this that's the type of
[1:20:57] brother bannon was typing of the sealing
[1:21:00] of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:04] that anointing
[1:21:06] that that refilling
[1:21:08] first john chapter 3
[1:21:11] behold what manner of love the father
[1:21:13] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:21:16] called the sons of god amen now we read
[1:21:18] last week uh galatians
[1:21:21] uh one that says because we are
[1:21:24] sons
[1:21:26] amen because we are children
[1:21:29] amen now john's saying that we should be
[1:21:32] called the sons of god
[1:21:35] and remember in process of adoption
[1:21:39] remember process of adoption there's
[1:21:41] relationship
[1:21:42] in adoption and there's placement in
[1:21:45] adoption
[1:21:46] relationship is like we know in this
[1:21:48] world in this country relationship is
[1:21:51] you belong to somebody's family and
[1:21:53] another family's adopting you into their
[1:21:55] family and now that's a relationship
[1:21:57] you're a son now
[1:21:59] amen but a placement's a different thing
[1:22:02] where do you fit in that family
[1:22:04] what part do you play
[1:22:06] what are you supposed to accomplish or
[1:22:09] add to that family now that you're a
[1:22:10] part of it right
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:13] adoption of a child of god
[1:22:16] is not a an adoption of relationship
[1:22:19] because if you are a son you are always
[1:22:21] a son amen you were never not a son
[1:22:24] again pardon the double negative but you
[1:22:27] were never not a son
[1:22:28] just like the prodigal son he said
[1:22:30] never not a son you're always a son so
[1:22:33] if adoption is not a matter of
[1:22:35] relationship then what is it a matter of
[1:22:38] placement
[1:22:40] where do you fit what is your part right
[1:22:43] who are you
[1:22:45] it's like i said last week it's hard to
[1:22:47] fathom in this world today but it's
[1:22:49] become so prominent especially among
[1:22:51] young people me and john went over uh
[1:22:54] mary gave us this little stand uh it was
[1:22:56] a client of mine and sonya's now helping
[1:22:59] her pack she's moving but anyway we were
[1:23:01] over there and picking a couple things
[1:23:02] up that i'd left over there and uh and
[1:23:05] we were talking about that
[1:23:07] and
[1:23:08] and that
[1:23:09] uh and that
[1:23:10] relationship in in that in that manner
[1:23:14] see to to to understand what
[1:23:19] what is it that is the number one
[1:23:22] killer of young people today
[1:23:25] themselves
[1:23:28] i think it's 15 and younger
[1:23:30] the number one cause of death among 15
[1:23:33] and younger is killing their their own
[1:23:35] cells
[1:23:36] suicide
[1:23:37] number one thing
[1:23:39] and it boggles the mind to believe
[1:23:42] how anybody especially in this country
[1:23:44] of plenty
[1:23:46] quote unquote
[1:23:47] this uh godly country quote unquote
[1:23:50] how people could get to the place that
[1:23:53] they that they believe that the unknown
[1:23:56] which most people have no clue what is
[1:23:59] going to happen when they die most
[1:24:02] people are scared of it
[1:24:04] they're
[1:24:05] they're more they're less afraid of the
[1:24:08] unknown
[1:24:09] than what the
[1:24:12] uh the possibilities are in this life
[1:24:15] and they kill themselves
[1:24:17] for different reasons but that's what it
[1:24:19] boils down to whether they're being
[1:24:21] bullied or whether they're being ignored
[1:24:23] or whether they're whatever the
[1:24:24] situation
[1:24:25] maybe they're trying to impress a
[1:24:26] girlfriend or i don't know
[1:24:28] but pretty extreme to impress a girl but
[1:24:30] anyway uh
[1:24:32] it does happen
[1:24:34] but uh
[1:24:36] but the unknown
[1:24:38] is more attractive to them
[1:24:41] than what they can do and accomplish
[1:24:42] here what they can see and touch and
[1:24:45] smell
[1:24:46] it's it's just hard to believe but
[1:24:47] that's the number one killer among young
[1:24:49] people
[1:24:51] coal that isn't even in the top 20
[1:24:53] or 25 or something it's just
[1:24:55] it is way low on the totem pole number
[1:24:58] one is suicide
[1:25:00] number one is suicide and it's gaining
[1:25:02] steam too
[1:25:04] amen the more these kids are dictated to
[1:25:06] and throw masks on all day long just
[1:25:08] losing their identities and all that
[1:25:10] they're trying to grow up to to to do
[1:25:13] and to live and and to
[1:25:15] search for and find some identity in
[1:25:17] their lives they lose it
[1:25:19] amen they lose it
[1:25:21] and and and without that what do you
[1:25:23] have
[1:25:24] and the poor kids are crippled
[1:25:26] from children they're crippled
[1:25:29] it's sad but anyway
[1:25:32] call the sons of god therefore the world
[1:25:34] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[1:25:36] beloved
[1:25:37] now are we the sons of god so that's
[1:25:40] relationship
[1:25:42] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:25:44] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:25:46] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:25:48] as he is
[1:25:49] every man that had this hope in him
[1:25:51] purified himself even as he is pure
[1:25:54] whosoever committed sin we don't get
[1:25:56] into the sin thing again but
[1:25:59] this goes along with the thought i had
[1:26:00] about sin
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:04] we mentioned last week
[1:26:07] a fifth verse
[1:26:08] a fourth verse who whosoever committed
[1:26:10] sin transgresseth also the law for sin
[1:26:14] is the transgression of the law and you
[1:26:16] know that he was manifested to take away
[1:26:18] our sin
[1:26:19] and in him is no sin whosoever abideth
[1:26:23] in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth has
[1:26:26] not seen him neither known him little
[1:26:28] children that no man deceive you
[1:26:31] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:26:34] even as he is righteous
[1:26:36] he that committed sin is of the devil
[1:26:40] now remember where is that committed of
[1:26:42] sin come from
[1:26:44] because there's a difference
[1:26:46] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:26:48] for the devil's sentence from the
[1:26:50] beginning
[1:26:51] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:26:54] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:26:57] works of the devil or sin or unbelief
[1:27:01] amen jesus came that he would destroy
[1:27:05] the unbelief
[1:27:07] that's why he said in john 3 15 16 if
[1:27:10] you believe
[1:27:12] amen now that's believe unto receiving
[1:27:15] that's believe unto becoming not just
[1:27:17] believe satan believes
[1:27:19] amen right he knows very well god exists
[1:27:22] he knows very well that jesus is the son
[1:27:25] of god he knows all that very well
[1:27:28] believeth unto receiving becoming
[1:27:32] amen
[1:27:34] you receive that
[1:27:37] for that purpose the son of god was
[1:27:39] manifested that he might destroy those
[1:27:41] works whosoever is born of god does not
[1:27:45] commit sin
[1:27:47] does not commit sin if you are born of
[1:27:51] god you do not sin
[1:27:54] that's the scripture
[1:27:56] you can say it however you want you can
[1:27:58] believe it however you want but that's
[1:28:00] what the bible says
[1:28:02] now what again what part of you does not
[1:28:05] sin
[1:28:06] because we know that we make mistakes in
[1:28:08] this flesh all the time every day
[1:28:11] we do things wrong all the time every
[1:28:13] day so what part of you
[1:28:16] cannot sin
[1:28:18] that's soul
[1:28:20] because that's where the birth takes
[1:28:21] place
[1:28:23] said do i enter in my mother's womb the
[1:28:25] second time he didn't have a revelation
[1:28:27] but to have a revelation of what the new
[1:28:29] birth is which you won't hear about out
[1:28:31] in the world hardly anymore and the
[1:28:33] world
[1:28:34] christendom doesn't preach about the new
[1:28:35] birth anymore sometimes you don't even
[1:28:37] hardly hear it in message churches but
[1:28:39] without that new birth you will be here
[1:28:42] when the rapture's gone
[1:28:44] am i whether foolish virgin or just flat
[1:28:46] unbeliever doesn't matter well it does
[1:28:49] matter but uh you know what i'm saying
[1:28:51] if you're not a believer though if that
[1:28:53] if you're not born again you're going to
[1:28:55] be left here right because that's the
[1:28:57] ticket
[1:28:58] that's the token the holy spirit is the
[1:29:00] token without that you're going to be
[1:29:02] left here that's right so when that life
[1:29:05] comes in and that seal is sealed in
[1:29:08] there it burned out that old nature he
[1:29:11] burned out as ephesians 2 burned out
[1:29:14] that old desire
[1:29:16] because you were of nature by nature
[1:29:20] what is that nature brother graham said
[1:29:22] the nature is of the nature of the
[1:29:24] spirit is the soul
[1:29:26] the nature
[1:29:27] so if that nature if that old nature is
[1:29:30] burned out by the holy ghost and fire
[1:29:33] and burns out the old nature then you
[1:29:36] have no more desire to sin right
[1:29:39] there's no more sin in this
[1:29:41] in the man the soul there's no more
[1:29:43] desire for sin
[1:29:45] none
[1:29:46] you those the things of the world all
[1:29:48] those things they're they've all gone
[1:29:50] away they're not they're no longer a
[1:29:52] part of who you really are
[1:29:55] now these things that we have the
[1:29:57] constant affection reason memory that
[1:29:59] all affects our bodies see case fill
[1:30:01] smell here and those things are affected
[1:30:03] by that
[1:30:04] and those things they do trip up and
[1:30:06] they do make mistakes and they do list
[1:30:08] the things they say shouldn't say or say
[1:30:10] things they shouldn't say
[1:30:12] act in ways and our emotions and our
[1:30:14] spirit gets the best of us sometimes
[1:30:17] we get angry when we shouldn't be right
[1:30:20] we say something that we shouldn't say
[1:30:22] that's in here not your soul
[1:30:26] that's the mistakes you make here
[1:30:28] and that's why god give us that vehicle
[1:30:30] that when we've done that and there's a
[1:30:33] conscience in here now that says you've
[1:30:35] done wrong then you can take that and
[1:30:38] that vehicle god gave us
[1:30:41] first john 1 9 and say i'm sorry lord
[1:30:45] yes and he said i forgive you amen
[1:30:48] if you confess your sin he is just and
[1:30:51] faithful to forgive you of your sin amen
[1:30:55] then that weight is lifted off of you
[1:30:58] that sin no longer accounted to you the
[1:31:02] man said he puts it on the head of satan
[1:31:04] where it lays till the day of judgment
[1:31:06] praise god that's the best place i can
[1:31:08] think of for it because it was his to
[1:31:10] begin with right
[1:31:11] amen was never mind to begin with it was
[1:31:14] his and he can have it back
[1:31:17] and he can be accountable for it at the
[1:31:18] white throne judgment and cast in hell
[1:31:21] for it amen because i'm justified i
[1:31:24] never did it to begin with
[1:31:26] praise the lord amen that's your god's
[1:31:30] soul god see taking over
[1:31:33] whosoever is born of god does not sin
[1:31:37] for his whose not brother branham's
[1:31:41] not the popes
[1:31:42] not some great minister or some great
[1:31:44] evangelist or some pastor
[1:31:47] amen not brother rap not brother greens
[1:31:50] glomscene
[1:31:52] amen amen his poncy
[1:31:55] remaineth in you
[1:31:59] remain it again what does that word
[1:32:02] remaineth me doesn't mean it was put
[1:32:03] there today that you were that you were
[1:32:05] born again or come to an offer accepted
[1:32:07] jesus
[1:32:08] no remaineth means it wasn't put there
[1:32:10] it was always there and it's still there
[1:32:13] and it remains there
[1:32:15] that's what remain means
[1:32:18] and if you have any questions about that
[1:32:20] i don't think you do i've been
[1:32:22] challenged about it before
[1:32:24] not here uh back in north carolina i've
[1:32:26] been challenged about that before
[1:32:29] i don't know how brother brown makes it
[1:32:31] very clear thinking man's filter
[1:32:33] let's look at this
[1:32:37] i'll close here
[1:32:39] sometime today
[1:32:41] thank you man's filter
[1:32:43] uh quote 108. notice that word cannot
[1:32:46] deny itself again word test yes praise
[1:32:49] the lord
[1:32:50] it is satisfied or is desired desire of
[1:32:54] what
[1:32:55] what made you desire it in the first
[1:32:57] place
[1:32:58] because
[1:33:00] what made you desired in the first place
[1:33:02] remember you're the four known
[1:33:04] predestinated of god
[1:33:06] amen you are the four known
[1:33:10] predestinated of god
[1:33:12] for known just means he knew you back
[1:33:14] then he knows all things
[1:33:16] beginning i don't say beginning from the
[1:33:19] beginning to the end
[1:33:21] to him there is no beginning
[1:33:22] because from the beginning to the end he
[1:33:24] knows all things
[1:33:26] so if he knows that it's in the mind of
[1:33:28] god this is just the four no he for new
[1:33:30] you
[1:33:32] he
[1:33:33] predestinated you based on who you would
[1:33:35] be and where you would live and what
[1:33:37] house you grew up in and what state
[1:33:38] you'd be born in and what family you
[1:33:40] would have and all those things god
[1:33:42] predestinate
[1:33:44] the gifts you might have the gift of god
[1:33:46] the things that those are all
[1:33:47] predestination
[1:33:49] is predestination by poor knowledge
[1:33:52] you are the predestination of the god
[1:33:54] now because down in your soul reading
[1:33:57] the quote again here now
[1:33:58] because down in your soul there was a
[1:34:01] predestinated seed which was eternal
[1:34:05] life
[1:34:06] listen
[1:34:07] always
[1:34:09] laying in there
[1:34:11] always laying in there the predestinated
[1:34:15] seed of eternal life was always in there
[1:34:21] all the way he says it twice
[1:34:23] always was in there
[1:34:26] praise the lord now how somebody in this
[1:34:28] message contradicting that could come up
[1:34:30] with something different as well that's
[1:34:31] their choice
[1:34:32] i choose not to because it matches the
[1:34:34] scripture right amen
[1:34:37] no i don't just take brother branham's
[1:34:38] word for it friend i find in the bible
[1:34:40] where it says
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:43] i haven't found him wrong yet and i
[1:34:44] don't think i will but it's in the bible
[1:34:48] remaineth there brother brown said
[1:34:51] always in there
[1:34:53] and he doesn't just say it this one time
[1:34:55] he says it several times always in there
[1:34:57] all the father has given me will come to
[1:34:59] me there isn't any of them going to be
[1:35:01] lost praise god for that
[1:35:03] friend if you need to help
[1:35:06] in some faith in some way for a loved
[1:35:08] one or a lost loved one or a child or
[1:35:10] something you hold on to that
[1:35:12] because they belong to you they're of
[1:35:14] your lineage
[1:35:16] if they belong to you they belong to him
[1:35:19] and if you are his they are his
[1:35:23] you claim them and believe that just
[1:35:25] like you do for your own salvation
[1:35:28] amen are you saved yes
[1:35:31] are you yes then they are
[1:35:35] no questions
[1:35:36] don't let the devil make you doubt or
[1:35:37] believe anything else yes you understand
[1:35:40] don't let that devil try to get you to
[1:35:42] believe anything else i don't care where
[1:35:44] they are i don't care what they're doing
[1:35:46] i don't care what they're going through
[1:35:47] i don't care what kind of life they're
[1:35:48] living makes no difference
[1:35:52] in many ways i was that person back then
[1:35:55] myself right
[1:35:57] but i never was really that person i've
[1:35:59] always been this person
[1:36:01] praise god amen amen
[1:36:03] so you hold on to that
[1:36:06] none of them are going to be lost yes
[1:36:09] praise the lord
[1:36:10] a thinking man's taste when a thinking
[1:36:12] man hears the word of god my sheep hear
[1:36:14] my voice says strangers though not
[1:36:16] father i follow
[1:36:18] for down in there is life
[1:36:21] down in there is
[1:36:23] and life connects with the light
[1:36:27] so what is that that's the life that was
[1:36:30] in there the seed of god that lay
[1:36:31] dormant
[1:36:33] and the spirit of god the holy spirit
[1:36:35] coming in life needs life
[1:36:38] and when the life meets the life what
[1:36:40] does it do
[1:36:42] well it produces life
[1:36:44] a life that's now living in you
[1:36:47] the life that is now controlling you
[1:36:51] because it is who you are
[1:36:53] at one time that seed was dormant
[1:36:55] because of that old nature in there but
[1:36:57] when that which came in because of the
[1:36:59] fault of the garden but when that got
[1:37:01] burned out the holy spirit came that
[1:37:03] life met that life all there is is life
[1:37:06] now
[1:37:07] there is no darkness there is no doubt
[1:37:10] it's all life
[1:37:11] because that life brought life
[1:37:14] bringing it to life
[1:37:16] oh can't you do the natural types of
[1:37:17] spiritual
[1:37:19] friend when there's there's a seed that
[1:37:20] can lay in there and can lay dormant for
[1:37:22] years
[1:37:23] but when it gets in the right conditions
[1:37:25] the water the sun when life comes to
[1:37:27] that seed it brings life
[1:37:31] and what was ever in that seed will
[1:37:33] produce of itself
[1:37:35] look at this that seed from first john
[1:37:37] i'll read this again i did last week
[1:37:39] from last week
[1:37:41] this seed
[1:37:42] the greek of this seed
[1:37:46] the grain or kernel
[1:37:48] which contains within itself
[1:37:52] the germ of future plans
[1:37:56] praise the lord amen that's what it was
[1:37:58] with abraham and
[1:38:00] levi
[1:38:01] that's exactly what it is scripture it's
[1:38:03] exactly what it is god you me that's
[1:38:05] exactly what that seed that was in there
[1:38:07] all that seed contained was what the
[1:38:09] life was in it for future plants or for
[1:38:12] future life
[1:38:14] amen well if you got if you got the if
[1:38:16] there's a seed of a dog in there what's
[1:38:18] it going to produce not a cat it's going
[1:38:20] to produce a dog
[1:38:21] and it's not going to be one sell a dog
[1:38:24] and next sell a cat and next sell a
[1:38:26] horse and an excellent goat or a next
[1:38:28] celery it's going to be all dog
[1:38:31] it's going to be sell sell on sell on
[1:38:33] sell on selling it's going to be a dog
[1:38:35] right it's going to look like a dog
[1:38:38] if that's if that seed in there is a is
[1:38:40] a
[1:38:41] an orange seed then it's going to
[1:38:43] produce an orange tree
[1:38:46] but if that seed in there is the seed of
[1:38:49] god god's intellectual property that he
[1:38:52] dropped in you if it's his seed what's
[1:38:54] he going to produce
[1:38:57] amen
[1:38:59] that's all it can produce
[1:39:01] because the seed can only produce the
[1:39:03] life that's in it
[1:39:06] praise the lord amen the divine energy
[1:39:11] here's another the divine energy
[1:39:13] operating within the soul
[1:39:17] by which we are regenerated
[1:39:20] born again
[1:39:22] made new
[1:39:24] no longer the creature we were
[1:39:27] but a new creature in christ jesus
[1:39:30] old things are passed away behold all
[1:39:32] things have become new
[1:39:34] amen i might still be the same other
[1:39:36] young guy i've always been
[1:39:37] but inside something changed exactly i i
[1:39:41] may have told you this months ago or at
[1:39:42] some point in time i remember when i did
[1:39:44] my sister's funeral
[1:39:46] uh she passed in
[1:39:48] 2003
[1:39:51] she passed 2003 cancer and
[1:39:55] she had a pretty full funeral in north
[1:39:57] carolina there was one old friend i
[1:39:59] remember her from way back in high
[1:40:01] school man they ran together had fast
[1:40:04] cars and guys and they did all kinds of
[1:40:06] stuff things that i don't even want to
[1:40:08] mention or even think of
[1:40:10] but they weren't good people
[1:40:13] and i remember she came to the funeral
[1:40:16] and
[1:40:17] she got up and i i can't remember she
[1:40:19] testified or she told me personally but
[1:40:22] she said this is not the janice i knew
[1:40:25] this was a different person
[1:40:28] the genus i knew was a completely
[1:40:30] different individual this is not this
[1:40:32] not this
[1:40:33] the the the woman that was laying in
[1:40:36] that casket of course that wasn't her
[1:40:37] anyway was a different person
[1:40:40] it was not hers
[1:40:42] she said something happened to her along
[1:40:44] her life's journey that changed her from
[1:40:47] who she was now she looked exactly the
[1:40:50] same
[1:40:51] it just got old
[1:40:53] but what changed on the inside made
[1:40:55] everything on the outside change right
[1:40:58] that's why we're
[1:41:00] and and that's one of the things that
[1:41:02] the devil uses against us too
[1:41:05] the devil uses that against you how many
[1:41:07] times do you think the devil has come
[1:41:09] and tried to whisper in your ear and you
[1:41:11] think you're a child of god
[1:41:14] no tell me satan he never tried to tell
[1:41:16] you that
[1:41:17] amen if he hadn't you're probably not
[1:41:20] one
[1:41:21] i guarantee you god satan at some point
[1:41:24] it's common space you got age on us like
[1:41:25] most of us and said oh you think you're
[1:41:28] and see what you did see what you did
[1:41:30] get you
[1:41:31] get you all
[1:41:32] and then all of a sudden you downed it
[1:41:35] down the dolphins to get condemn you
[1:41:38] when god is there to liberate you and
[1:41:40] set you free
[1:41:41] because you didn't fall from this
[1:41:43] you can't
[1:41:45] hear me now if if if this is you if this
[1:41:49] seed this soul
[1:41:51] that life is really you you cannot fall
[1:41:55] from it
[1:41:56] impossible
[1:41:57] you cannot okay
[1:41:59] amen no matter what you did what mistake
[1:42:01] you made what life you lived before
[1:42:03] now that doesn't excuse sin right that
[1:42:06] doesn't give you the right to just do
[1:42:07] whatever you want to do that just proves
[1:42:09] who you really are
[1:42:11] amen that's a good way to explain
[1:42:13] predestination that just proves who you
[1:42:14] are if you say well i'm predestined i
[1:42:16] just do whatever i just proves what's in
[1:42:18] you and who you really are see
[1:42:20] but if you're the true seed of god that
[1:42:23] life is going to produce itself
[1:42:26] let me close with this quote here i
[1:42:28] still haven't got to that other
[1:42:31] thing i wanted to get to last week
[1:42:33] this is also thinking men's filter just
[1:42:36] a few um
[1:42:37] quotes down
[1:42:39] he said oh my there is that real
[1:42:41] filtration of all the sin of the world
[1:42:44] the love of the world is dead and this
[1:42:46] soul is drawing only on one thing this
[1:42:48] soul
[1:42:50] is drawing only on one thing remember
[1:42:52] that's the free will
[1:42:54] amen the the free will that you have
[1:42:57] is in the soul you got ck spill smelling
[1:43:00] here it's in the body you got a ma
[1:43:02] imagination constant infection reason
[1:43:04] memory in the spirit but the soul is
[1:43:06] drawing on that one thing because
[1:43:07] there's free will in there that's that
[1:43:10] and that that's the seed of god it's
[1:43:12] only drawing on one thing here it is
[1:43:15] don't forget it brother graham said
[1:43:17] all you out on the telephone set this
[1:43:20] down in your mind when a thinking man
[1:43:21] begins to think who he's going to stand
[1:43:24] before and what the word of god is
[1:43:27] he begins to think
[1:43:30] when he draws through that there's
[1:43:33] nothing to get through it but the holy
[1:43:35] ghost
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:38] the holy ghost which is what that
[1:43:41] germ-seed word from the beginning that
[1:43:44] logos
[1:43:45] germ seed word logos from the beginning
[1:43:48] that was there in god that's god that
[1:43:51] just came out of god that logos had just
[1:43:53] come out of god that intellectual
[1:43:55] property
[1:43:56] that just came out of god at that real
[1:43:59] germ seed word
[1:44:01] and if it's that germ seed word that's
[1:44:03] living in there look what he said now
[1:44:08] that uh that you was in god at the
[1:44:11] beginning
[1:44:12] standing here drawing that sea life
[1:44:17] the seed is in your heart by four
[1:44:20] nations predestination hallelujah he
[1:44:22] says
[1:44:23] the seed is already in there by the
[1:44:26] foreknowledge of god predestinated
[1:44:30] and it draws through that holy spirit
[1:44:33] that word that predestinated word seed
[1:44:36] life it draws through that
[1:44:39] because it can't draw through nothing
[1:44:42] else but the word
[1:44:44] that's all it can draw through the
[1:44:46] thinking man's filter you remember the
[1:44:47] thinking man's filter
[1:44:49] brother ma'am talked about the scripture
[1:44:51] being that thinking man's filter
[1:44:53] what's going to get through here a
[1:44:54] thinking man won't sin i think he man
[1:44:56] won't try to shove cigarettes through
[1:44:58] here because it won't go
[1:45:00] because that's contrary to the word it's
[1:45:02] contrary to the spirit of god
[1:45:05] he can't shove gambling through here
[1:45:06] won't go
[1:45:08] it's got to be the holy spirit it's got
[1:45:10] to be from that word german seed life
[1:45:12] from the beginning
[1:45:14] you can't take a baptist doctrine and
[1:45:16] try to shove it through here it won't go
[1:45:18] right a catholic methodist whatever you
[1:45:22] some message
[1:45:23] doctrines
[1:45:25] they won't go through here because
[1:45:26] they're not the word right well they
[1:45:28] might have a quote or two they might
[1:45:30] have even a scripture to but unless it's
[1:45:33] ordained by the holy spirit it will not
[1:45:34] go through this filter
[1:45:36] that's that germ-seed light that seed
[1:45:40] that was down in there praise the lord
[1:45:43] amen we call to see actually if that
[1:45:45] holy spirit has come in there and taking
[1:45:47] control over that soul it's no longer a
[1:45:50] seed it's a life
[1:45:52] when a seed is brought to life it's no
[1:45:54] longer a seed it's whatever the life
[1:45:57] that was in the seed that's conformed
[1:46:00] amen
[1:46:01] so what is it controlling your life
[1:46:03] today what is it controlling our lives
[1:46:05] who are we really
[1:46:07] what's controlling you
[1:46:08] who is in there
[1:46:10] it'll manifest itself on the outside
[1:46:12] what are your desires
[1:46:14] get the word test you'll find out real
[1:46:16] quick very much do they decide the world
[1:46:19] more
[1:46:20] or do they put god first in their life
[1:46:23] do they desire to draw off of the things
[1:46:25] of the world or they
[1:46:26] desire to draw off the things of god
[1:46:29] it'll tell real quick
[1:46:31] i'm not i'm not telling you not to live
[1:46:33] your life or have hobbies and things
[1:46:34] that's not what i'm talking about but
[1:46:36] when something becomes more important to
[1:46:38] you than god there's a red flag
[1:46:41] right amen i'm not saying you're not
[1:46:43] born again but that's a red flag all
[1:46:45] right you start to examine yourself
[1:46:48] and if that continues on like that and
[1:46:50] there's nothing checked or done about it
[1:46:51] then i would really question because if
[1:46:53] you if you're a child of god and you
[1:46:55] begin to put something before god things
[1:46:57] aren't going to go right
[1:46:59] god will speak to you and say
[1:47:01] you've got to remove this from your life
[1:47:04] remember we talked about elijah when god
[1:47:06] sent elijah down the chair he had to do
[1:47:08] some cutting on elijah because too much
[1:47:10] of elijah was living
[1:47:12] too much of elijah's spirit and will was
[1:47:14] still prevalent and god had to cut that
[1:47:16] out of it
[1:47:18] he had to send him to zarephath and
[1:47:19] refine him because two chapters later he
[1:47:22] was about to have the greatest showdown
[1:47:24] on earth on mount carmel all right 400
[1:47:28] opponents and all the devils of hell
[1:47:30] around
[1:47:32] praise the lord amen he called down the
[1:47:34] fire of god at that point because he'd
[1:47:36] been cut refined he called down the fire
[1:47:38] of god that licked up the wood the
[1:47:40] stones the sacrifice and everything else
[1:47:44] wasn't a bit of it left
[1:47:45] it got so embarrassing for those
[1:47:48] prophets they began to cut themselves
[1:47:50] just like it is the natural the nature
[1:47:52] of a of an unbeliever
[1:47:53] it's a heathen trait
[1:47:55] amen it's a heathen trait to cut
[1:47:57] yourself like that that's why this
[1:47:59] tattooing stuff they cut themselves
[1:48:01] that's how you know where you get that
[1:48:02] ink in your body amen
[1:48:05] this is a demonic spirit it wasn't of
[1:48:06] god it's against the word it was in it
[1:48:08] is now
[1:48:09] it's a trait it's a heathen trait
[1:48:12] amen and the sad thing is there's
[1:48:14] churches out there that are promoting it
[1:48:16] as being okay
[1:48:18] man as soon as that place moved in next
[1:48:20] door i put my hands on that wall and i
[1:48:22] god
[1:48:23] you're out of here
[1:48:25] i told god
[1:48:26] i don't know how many times i was 20 30

[1:54:16] praise god god's been so good to us
[1:54:18] amen
[1:54:20] just a moment um
[1:54:22] a couple things now i need to mention
[1:54:25] we're going to have the the dinner next
[1:54:27] door now
[1:54:28] um
[1:54:29] most of it's all set up there'll be a
[1:54:31] few things to do
[1:54:32] you'll notice when you go in if you
[1:54:34] haven't already that we haven't set up
[1:54:36] the tables to sit at and the tape we've
[1:54:38] got the one table where the plates the
[1:54:40] silverware and the main dishes the side
[1:54:43] dishes desserts and then the drinks uh
[1:54:46] on the other side over there i'm
[1:54:48] thinking hopefully that unless we just
[1:54:50] get an over abundance of food which is
[1:54:52] okay by me
[1:54:53] uh in case we get we just put that in my
[1:54:56] table but
[1:54:57] we just
[1:54:58] if we do we can just make another table
[1:55:00] uh to put it on also sister pat brought
[1:55:03] some plants she had
[1:55:04] dug up for
[1:55:06] a contribution if you want one uh
[1:55:08] because
[1:55:09] and she wants all the contributions of
[1:55:12] that to go to
[1:55:13] uh i guess what mike and my wife have
[1:55:15] started
[1:55:16] a uh
[1:55:19] a fund a a uh i guess fundraiser i i
[1:55:23] don't like that
[1:55:24] that makes me feel like i'm back and
[1:55:26] teaching school again
[1:55:28] um
[1:55:29] really i mean how many cars did we watch
[1:55:34] fundraiser god provides amen but like i
[1:55:37] said wednesday sometimes god the
[1:55:39] provision god is through our hands
[1:55:42] praise the lord god provided us this
[1:55:44] place
[1:55:45] amen but if he didn't provide us to be
[1:55:47] able to pay for it he'd kick us out next
[1:55:49] month so amen
[1:55:52] our hand so anyway so there's a jar next
[1:55:55] to the plants and it's for contributions
[1:55:58] to make towards
[1:55:59] our sound system as you know
[1:56:01] or most of you do the sound system is
[1:56:03] not ours it's brother roger collins so
[1:56:05] we got we need to give it i need to give
[1:56:07] it back to him sometime
[1:56:09] he doesn't need it right now but i don't
[1:56:11] want to just keep it like
[1:56:13] our possession so we want to we want to
[1:56:14] get our own
[1:56:16] uh
[1:56:17] equipment things so
[1:56:19] where
[1:56:20] it's
[1:56:20] it gets a little expensive i don't mind
[1:56:22] paying for it like i do so many of the
[1:56:25] things that's okay but when it gets into
[1:56:28] that
[1:56:28] type of finance it's it's a little more
[1:56:30] challenging so anyway so the jars there
[1:56:33] for and sister pat the plants if you're
[1:56:36] going to take one and put the money just
[1:56:38] put the money in the jar because she's
[1:56:39] donating that to the church
[1:56:41] so amen and we're still working on the
[1:56:44] streaming if you've been streaming and
[1:56:46] you go back and look at the archives
[1:56:48] they're still not quite like we want
[1:56:49] them to be
[1:56:50] um i got another court to make an
[1:56:53] extension of that to make that look a
[1:56:54] little better but the extension didn't
[1:56:56] work it didn't read on the computer so
[1:56:58] it's just going to hang there for now
[1:57:00] like that i hope that's okay
[1:57:01] um i like things a little tidier than
[1:57:04] that but
[1:57:05] anyway we hardwired the camera so that
[1:57:08] we can make it work a little bit better
[1:57:10] the sound's a little
[1:57:11] uh still got a little staticky in it
[1:57:14] michael's working with the
[1:57:16] camera people to fix that and all so
[1:57:18] anyway just pray for us we just all that
[1:57:20] we try to do we do for the glory of the
[1:57:22] lord
[1:57:24] but
[1:57:25] so we'll have the meal next door just a
[1:57:27] moment

[1:58:05] you all know uh write texts brother dave
[1:58:08] green greeny i always try to separate
[1:58:10] that
[1:58:11] uh people say was he related to brother

[1:58:15] greedy
[1:58:16] there's an e on the end
[1:58:19] david dave green

[1:58:24] please remember sister chris the family
[1:58:26] joy
[1:58:27] christy angela and and all the family in
[1:58:30] prayer brother dave was quite a
[1:58:32] he was quite a presence
[1:58:34] uh he was
[1:58:36] uh
[1:58:37] he was very much
[1:58:39] uh a presence
[1:58:41] so and he was he was the matriarch a
[1:58:44] patriarch of that family was he was the
[1:58:48] he was
[1:58:50] a strong personality yeah that's what
[1:58:53] i'm looking for
[1:58:54] he was a very strong personality but
[1:58:56] like i said wednesday night uh
[1:58:59] i i don't have any uh arrangement uh
[1:59:02] knowledge yet i don't know what's gonna
[1:59:04] go on i i don't have any i don't know
[1:59:06] i'd like to go to the memorial if there
[1:59:08] is one
[1:59:09] we're all invited but
[1:59:11] uh because brother dave was very good to
[1:59:13] me when we first moved here
[1:59:15] uh it was just a real blessing and i i
[1:59:18] told you this testimony i'll say real
[1:59:19] quick not keep you standing so long but
[1:59:22] real quick when uh when we were here we
[1:59:25] me and dave were with some other people
[1:59:27] to function something he said you want
[1:59:29] to go get a steak you know me yeah
[1:59:32] um so he said go get a steak i said yes
[1:59:35] because i said stuff and i said yes
[1:59:38] so he took me over we went to little
[1:59:39] abner's on silverbelt really good
[1:59:43] uh steakhouse
[1:59:43] been here years but we got he and he
[1:59:45] ordered
[1:59:46] he ordered the two most expensive steaks
[1:59:48] on the menu there were 35
[1:59:51] back in 2002.
[1:59:53] uh i don't know what they charged now
[1:59:55] but they were expensive big porterhouse
[1:59:57] big thick
[1:59:58] uh porterhouse steaks you ordered two of
[2:00:00] them and we were eating about halfway
[2:00:02] through or i can't remember this part
[2:00:04] but like halfway through or
[2:00:06] when he was paying the bill or something
[2:00:07] he told me he said this is my last
[2:00:08] hundred bucks
[2:00:10] and that's just what he did
[2:00:12] he took his last hundred dollars and
[2:00:14] bought me dinner
[2:00:17] he said i have no more money broke
[2:00:20] that's just the way dave green believed
[2:00:21] it i don't advocate that to you
[2:00:25] just go spend your last penny on
[2:00:27] something but did scriptural lady come
[2:00:29] and put in her the two mice and jesus
[2:00:32] said she put more in all the rest and
[2:00:34] all the millionaires too much half a
[2:00:36] cent you know to my sin was worth half a
[2:00:38] cent too much and it was worth more than
[2:00:41] all the rest right you mean because she
[2:00:43] gave up her substance she did all she
[2:00:45] had
[2:00:46] amen he gave all he had
[2:00:49] he later after that when i was in the
[2:00:51] mountains uh 2005 he became a
[2:00:53] multi-millionaire
[2:00:55] off the land of course then the real
[2:00:57] estate thing crashed but that's just
[2:00:58] kind of man he was
[2:01:00] he was a giving man he was uh he had a
[2:01:03] good heart i know he when he became rich
[2:01:05] again he bought cars for people he
[2:01:06] bought this big huge piano for love
[2:01:08] divine and grand piano he just you just
[2:01:11] that kind of person
[2:01:12] amen he lost all again that stopped in
[2:01:15] the real estate crash but
[2:01:17] uh but he never lost that spirit of that
[2:01:19] smile
[2:01:20] and uh he used to see harmony he used to
[2:01:23] sing at the tabernacle with brother
[2:01:24] green i thought him and brother green
[2:01:26] sounded good together actually too
[2:01:28] you know but anyway i just just a little
[2:01:31] memorial little testimony from my heart
[2:01:34] about how dave green affected my life
[2:01:36] and that's just a little bit of it but
[2:01:38] uh anyway i appreciate you indulge me
[2:01:40] for that but we'll go uh we'll go next
[2:01:43] door and have a meal and fellowship and
[2:01:45] i'm looking forward to it so
[2:01:47] uh if you came in a little late and your
[2:01:49] things are in here we'll just move them
[2:01:51] over so there'll be a little transition
[2:01:53] period uh getting some things set up and
[2:01:55] appreciate the zincas they gave us most
[2:01:58] of all those long tables and we had
[2:02:00] chairs and things so i certainly
[2:02:02] appreciate everything and all the
[2:02:03] efforts everybody's done
