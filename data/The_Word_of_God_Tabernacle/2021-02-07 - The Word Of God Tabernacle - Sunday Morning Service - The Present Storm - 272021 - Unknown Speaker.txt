i'm a failure i want to be as paul said i die daily that i can be out of the way that you can work your holy spirit in us to bring your will in our lives what you have called us to do bless our servers we're here for one reason not to be seen or see one another to meet with you to meet with the living god to have our portions met to have a closer walk to be better prepared for our soon coming rapture bless our pastor father as he delivers your word use him as your oracles and our hearts to be softened and ready to receive from you the portion that we have need of at this time i'll

[Music] go over the prayer requests at this time there's a few that came in this morning my brother ben gave me a prayer request came in from sister pat she asked that we remember her in prayer she's going to be flying back to memphis tuesday for her son james funeral and to visit her family so we'll definitely want to remember traveling mercy's for her protection and i believe this one's from brother bennett i'm not sure he's uh the friend a brother of his friend of his brother michael holloway in north carolina i believe we want to remember him prayer he has in a large heart and uh according or or aortic aortic valve is leaking so we want to ask that the lord would give him a supernatural healing amen yes and also tuesday or thursday we're not sure about the time exactly so i we believe it's going to be in the morning but joel is set to have surgery to get his tonsils removed so we just asked that the congregation would remember to keep them in prayer during that time please and then the surgery would go um just fine and that he will recover uh quickly from it uh let's just stand as we uh lift our hands if you haven't have an unspoken prayer request and i'll ask brother zinka if you wouldn't mind praying over these knees this morning oh heavenly father we are lord we're gathered together in your precious name yes once again morning by morning and mercy we see yes you've allowed us to come together or just saints that believe the same things and you know how short the time is like umbrella said you just need to be more sincere but i just feel such a heaviness and has a darkness on me i just can't seem to be able to shake it long just i think it's the the urgency of the hour we're just helpless brother brown said this country is facing total annihilation law i just think the bombs are in the hangars pointing towards everything yes yes lord let us be ready yes let us be looking out to you and just casting our cares upon you yes i know lord when i come through the doors of your sanctuary here the burdens are lifted and yes yes that heaviness seems to disappear when they come together like this lord the needs here have been spoken and that we have many needs yes but i don't think we are we'd be a human being alive if we didn't have needs yes lord sorrows and cares for one another yes father you're the god that meets all our needs and you're more sufficient you're the god of all sufficiency that we have cast our cares upon you this morning for you care for us yes father lord we know that as the word is spoken you can send forth your word and heal him and brother branham said that that was your word way of healing people yes is when the pastor is speaking and that word is going forward yes take all the birth sickness away from us today and fear god as we go through the week let us remember one another yes for all our our needs and so many lord but you're more than sufficient yes lord help greatness let us just receive the word here today and know that the entrance of your word giveth light and how we need that in such a dark dismal time blog and your word is the only thing that can be a lamp unto our feet to our past yes and show us the way through this house lord jesus complexity of times lord we just give you all the glory and praise to your holy name in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen thank you may be seated at this time praise the lord i'll go ahead and read over the testimonies that was given to us by uh brother patrick and patricia echols i'm glad to see you here in service as well so i'll just read it as it's written here so over two years ago while correcting his teenage daughter our son lee was brought before a harsh judge that gave him a year's probation in order to stay away from the daughter for the year because he was working a high security job he then lost his job his wife and uh other two children had to see him outside the home just to spend any time together he had to spend money for rent plus you would be without a car for that whole time this has been a hard trial for them all and they have learned some hard lessons lee has grown to trust god more than ever at times it was almost more than he could bear not being able to get a job to support his family two weeks ago he got a job better than the one he had before all the trouble he's back home with his family and they are all doing well praise the lord hey man thank you for that amen [Applause] does anyone else have a testimony they'd like to share or a song special this morning yes yeah it's a testimony and also a prayer request altogether i just received a text from my niece just as i was sitting here this morning and she is um telling me that since my sister has been in the hospital with a ventilator and just a lot of complications and she is praising the lord because the doctors are saying she is progressing so well that she will probably be taken off the ventilation amen amen thank you lord thank you lord give the lord praise she wrote a long text and she's praising the lord and asking for prayer that everybody prayed that you know things just get better for her mom and i sure will amen amen thank you all for the praise yes praising amen amen does anyone else have a testimony or something special yes sister no i have a testimony yes excuse me my daughter kathy had she had emergency surgery in charlotte beside myself however not really because i was at peace but i don't like the little town because they messed up my sister but anyhow she came out good and the doctor there found interest in her because she has steeple a disease so he's gonna start following her up and making sure that she gets rid of the seborrheic under control which i find that a blessing because that feeble does destroy and will kill oh wow yes and like both of my great ones all my grandfathers have it so i give god glory to take care of her praise the lord amen amen you'll remember her in prayer amen anyone else this morning all right thank you brother micah may god bless you um the popular song i've seen before but i just wanted to read this two verses real quick before i start it um it's matthew 25 um five and six it just says while the bike room tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him amen i hear the sound of a mighty rushing wing and it's close now than it's ever been i can almost hear the trumpet [Music] we'll be amen and when jesus steps the dead in christ shall [Music] those that rise [Music] will be quickly changed i look around me i see prophecies [Music] yes i can almost hear our father says come and get your children let the midnight cry [Music] the bride of christ will rise [Music] and when jesus steps christ will rise and meet him in the end [Music] quickly [Music] and when jesus steps the dead in christ shall rise [Laughter] [Music] will be quickly changed [Music] jesus comes at the midnight ride [Music] when our jesus comes amen it's not much longer until it's going to come and get us and bring us home uh let's sing this next song here um he looks beyond my fault it's

just like to keep you updated that's all not going to keep you a long time or any of that again but i don't want it to be on the streaming it's just our personal business here for our church and our congregation so we'll do that at the end but again appreciate you being here and praise the lord bless you richly let's stand to our feet if we could and we're going to turn in our bibles now to saint john chapter 18. amen saint john chapter 18 we're going to begin our verse scripture reading amen saint john chapter 18 we're going to begin with verse 33 and good to see sister karen and tommy back and then brother tom came by himself last week so i know he's glad to have y'all with him and we're glad to have you here so st john 18. we're going to begin reading with verse 33 just a moment i just remembered again i want to remind you brother had mentioned the prayer request i had put in for brother mike holloway some of you may remember brother mike holloway from north carolina he preached for us one time at our old place on cortero but he's the brother that pro bono did the artwork for my book uh he didn't ask for a penny uh and he did it in one thing for me he didn't want i tried to uh tried to even take him to dinner he ended up taking me to dinner but he's just the fine brother him and sister tracy his wife so please remember him in prayer he's a very precious brother love him dearly he had texted me this week and said that he had been in the hospital for five days and they found out he had an enlarged heart and a leaking aortic valve and they're talking about replacing the valve uh but he's looking forward for a miracle and a touch from god before he schedules a surgery so please remember my precious brother our precious brother in prayer if you would uh for divine supernatural healing for him amen so now let's bow our heads if we could for a word of prayer before we read the word of god we thank you lord jesus again today for all that you do for us lord it's so wonderful lord to be in this world and to know god that we have a living risen savior that we can look to and believe in and trust in and pray to and lord know god that you're always with us and you never leave us or forsake us father we can turn to at any moment in any time of life father in desperation and need lord but also just to worship you just to praise you to glorify you lord or maybe just to talk to you for a few minutes just to have conversation just communion fellowship with you lord there's nothing like it we're so thankful god that you give us that opportunity that you come and that you live in each one of us that we feel that presence lord permeating from our very being god through our spirit in our bodies and lord filtrating out into this world today and showing and revealing to the rest of this world that there is still a living risen savior who is the same yesterday today and forever who is manifesting himself through a many member body lord you jesus christ once in one fleshly body now in a mini-membered fleshly body today god to express your same attributes as you have them today to this lost and dying world god help us lord to have the zeal and the dedication and the consecration in our lives lord to continue to spread this gospel the best that you call for us to do and lord preach it manifest it live it wherever we go god you would show us lord and help us in every way god bless your bride worldwide father wherever they may be whoever they may be we believe in the name of jesus god that you draw them close to you thank you for that precious blood that you shed at calvary that sets there on that mercy seat yet today god making intercession on our behalf taking our place lord that we can take yours and be robed in your righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish thank you for your provision thank you for your blessing thank you for these people that have come lord i pray god for every request and every need that was made known lord we just give you thanks and praise at each one of these these prayer requests lord the next time we meet together will be praise reports because of the because of the grace and mercy of our precious lord and savior as you are lord jesus god may you just bless this now the reading of your word speak to us from it lord have your will and way god speak to our hearts draw us closer to you lord and make us more like you for this last day we commit ourselves to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen saint john chapter 18 verse 33 then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me pilate answered i am a jew am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayeth that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice isla said unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and said unto them i find in him no fault at all but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews then cried there all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber you could be seated if you like i want to look at and focus on that 37th verse today although i really liked it there when pilate said i find no fault at in him at all i find in him no fault at all because that lets me know that if i'm in him and there's no fault in him amen amen if there's no fault in him and i'm in him hallelujah if you're in him and there's no fault in him there's no fault in you amen amen praise the lord you got to believe that live that way but my main focus today i want to look at is the 37th verse or 36th verse excuse me jesus said my kingdom is not of this world now i want to focus on that today i had someone ask me this weekend if i would go and listen to a certain message at brother branham priests on the oncoming storm and i did i went to listen to it i read some of it i read through it as i listened to it and the lord gave me a text and gave me something that i want to speak on today and in not in contrast but in complement of what brother branham priest on the uncommon oncoming storm i want to title this today the present storm right the present storm because the storm friend that brother branham was talking about is no longer an oncoming storm it is a present storm amen it is current it is here it is now amen and i i want to talk about the way of provision but i also want to talk about what jesus said here now although we know that we're in the middle of this storm that's going on all around us and all the things of the world and we talked about last week i thought as this person had recommended i really listened to this and as the lord gave me this text i thought well lord that fits perfect what we talked about last week on the on the darkness across the land and gross darkness the people because that storm is exactly what it is in the middle of that darkness uh the only time that i've ever seen a real storm now i've seen rain with its sun shining especially in florida and tucson but i've never seen a real storm i mean a serious storm going on where the sun is out where there's light now it might be bright outside because the cloud because the clouds can't completely hide out the sun but it's dark around and in the middle of storms it's darkness it's dreariness we talked about seattle and how people used to be a suicide capital and all and because it was so dreary and dark and 80 90 of their days have no sunlight at all and people just get depressed and they get down because of the darkness because of the dreary because of all the clouds and everything that are always around well that's what a storm is a storm is cloudiness the storm is uh a harmful winds thunder lightning and and damaging products behind a storm usually a real storm now you have little degrees of storms but a real storm like a hurricane tornado something like that um and and we have lived through a couple hurricanes my family has anyway we went through a couple of hurricanes one we were living in north carolina while we were living in florida and uh trust me there they can be pretty violent uh but that storm that we're talking about but i want to focus on this part that jesus talks about i don't want us to get our eyes on the storm micah sent me a thing the other day it just came in my mind actually i didn't even think of this at all when i was putting this together yesterday but mike has sent uh us a thing of jesus and a storm behind him and he says uh don't focus on the storm but keep your eyes on me hallelujah that was jesus see he was it was him talking with the storm behind him saying if you got your eyes on the storm you're not looking at me but don't have your eyes on the storm have your eyes on me am i so that's what my focus is today man to look at that because jesus said my kingdom is not of this world amen now what he said he said now if this kingdom was if my kingdom was of this world this world is cosmos not this earth this ball of dirt of course we know we're going to come live here but this world order this cosmos that we live in jesus said this is not my kingdom my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world now listen to this if my kingdom was of this world my servants would fight right my people would take care of me my people would watch after my uh me and all that's going on here my servants would fight for me we would take care of ourselves and the lord would fight for us amen amen but see jesus said this is not my world so what is the fight that we take up the fight that we take up isn't the fight to try to make this cosmos a better place our fight that we take up is the fight that we have that uh we get as many as we can into the kingdom of god and ourselves be ready for when god calls us to go home amen that's our fight that's what we're looking to we fight for the gospel not for all the things that's out here in the world we're not looking to be fighting on that you know the election just happened and everything that's gone on with that and and we know the results and what's happened and all that's behind us so what we're looking at now and what's coming up now what's taking place right now what's going on what are we looking to what's happening in the world this storm that we see swirling around us and all the things that's taking place jesus said to keep our eyes on him because we're not of this world amen his kingdom is not of this world if his kingdom is not of this world then our kingdom is not of this world right if this was not his place to come and rule and reign then it's not our place to come and rule and reign right we're a part of his kingdom and if we're a part of his kingdom then this is not our home amen this cosmos is not our home i'm not looking for perpetual existence friend i'm not looking for a home to make my home uh this world so much better i'm looking to try to get as many people i'm looking to go to heaven amen and i'm looking to try to take as many people with me as i can amen and i trust you do the same yeah that's your desire your desires to make heaven your home and to take as many people as you can with you that's the focus not to make all this the governments and the politics and the monies and the banks and big business and all not not to make we're not here to buy build big kingdoms and have big houses and and and worry about that that's not our this is a different time friend this is a different period there was a time for that but that time is not now right the time now is this bride is focused to go home this brightest focus to to make a rapture and to have our hearts and souls right before the lord amen to have such a faith amen that it changes these bodies into a and to his own glorious body yes that we leave here god is he he's coming waiting for us as he calls us to come to be home with him that's what he wants that's what we want this world is not his home his kingdom was not of this world our kingdom is his kingdom and if his kingdom wasn't of this world our kingdom is not of this world this is not our home friend amen if it was his servants would fight if it was we would fight if it was we would do what we should have to do to be able to keep it going but that's not what that's what the that's not what the anointing of the day is it's not what the word teaches us it's not what the message teaches us it teaches us now that it's time for us to be ready to go home to meet the lord amen let me read you i got several quotes i want to read to you today if that's okay amen yeah some from the oncoming storm this one is from the oddball uh one of my uh one of my favorites i guess you say not doctrinally but one of my favorites when it comes to truth messages i guess it's not doctrinal it's just uh well we're just oddball so that's just the way it is but god's always made his people eyeballs look at all the things that god did for the jewish people the jewish people when they come to when the when the jews went into egypt when joseph went into egypt and his father and all this whole family came they look like they look like crazy people compared to the egyptians they didn't fit in but they weren't supposed to fit in right god's children today we don't fit into this world but we're not supposed to fit in right the god's bride is not supposed to fit in with satan's bride right that's right we're not supposed to fit in we're supposed to be different god's called us to be that way people say well why are you like this and why do you do that because the bible says yes amen that's the plain and simple answer to it because the word says so well but why would he do that i don't think god cares if i do this this well if he didn't why would he put it in his bible right i don't care i don't believe god cares if i go here if i do this or drink a little here or uh uh cut my hair a little bit here or wear this certain garment or what i don't think god would care if he didn't care why he put in his word he does care yes he is he wants you to be called out he wants you to be separated he wants you to be a totally different group of people called out for this last day right you're not supposed to fit in right you're not supposed to look like the rest of them it's always in a person's nature to want to fit in right but we're not supposed to even the kitties at school you're not supposed to fit in in school i i mean you always want to you always want to have buddies and friends and things and you want to kind of fit in and have people to play with and stuff there's nothing abnormal about that but you're just not ever going to really fit in that's right people say that they have friends what are your friends the friends of people that that are with you and support you for what you do in your life not make fun of you don't talk about you don't put you down but they're there with you and help support you that's a friend amen and trust me there are very few really true friends in life today people we use the to me we use the word friend kind of loosely yes uh we say so and so is a friend they're really not a friend they might be an acquaintance they might even be a close acquaintance but they're very if you in retrospect look in your life and realize i've really only had a very few friends in my life right i have anyway maybe i'm just maybe i'm the oddball maybe i'm the only one that's only had maybe less than a handful of friends in my life but anyway the oddball brother branham tells now i've i've had this story before but when i saw this i wanted to read it again brother brown tells this story a couple times he says a little story and then i'm closing sorry i've kept you here about 45 minutes now there's a home christian home there's i've told you this critic and in this home there was they believed in god in this home they had a little boy there and he was scared to death in a storm lightning oh he was just scared to death scared to death see notice that amen scared to death there's a lot of that going on today uh in the storm in the middle of the storm a lot of people are scared to death in the middle of the storm going on out here today right a lot of people are yeah and a lot of people are are worried uh jobs dropping off like flies 20 30 40 000 jobs gone to this point now but people are worried but there's people that are genuinely scared they're afraid they're afraid and any time that you as a christian that you operate in fear or that you operate by by being scared or or worried you're operating in the wrong venue you're operating in the wrong emotion we shouldn't operate any motion we should operate by the moving of the spirit in your life you should move by what god tells you to do amen you should do what god is witnessing to you what god is speaking to you personally amen that that's how and not be scared scared is not a way to operate right scared is not a way to make decisions and do things you do things and operate and make decisions based on being scared then they're going to end up being the wrong decision trust me you're right but see he was scared in the middle of this storm brother ramsey scared to death he would run under tables anywhere when it would be lightning so one night had come a big storm out on the farm and they uh where they lived the trees was blowing lightning is flashing getting late in the night the mother said junior said now junior you go upstairs go to bed said now don't be scared go up there so the little junior with his pajamas home went up the steps looking back half crying laid down tried to go to sleep covered his head he wouldn't go to sleep the lightning flashing around the window so he said mama mama come up here and sleep with me well she said junior nothing is going to bother you the lightning can't hurt you he said but mama come up here please and sleep with me so the mother went up the steps laid down across the bed with junior said junior my little son mother wants to tell you something and i believe he wants to tell us something today in the middle of this storm she said junior we are a christian family we believe in god and we believe that god protects us in storms how many believes that yeah amen god protects us in the storm we believe that and we believe that god takes care of his own do you believe that believe god takes care of his own amen and said i want you to believe that junior that don't be scared god is with us and he'll protect us junior snubbed a few more times said mama i believe that too i said but when that lightning is so close to the window i like to feel a god that's got skin on it amen we took a mother's day on that one time remember that a mom with skin on it god with skin i like to feel a god that's got skin on it so i think that's a whole lot he said about the the adults today in this oncoming storm a god that's got skin on it but we believe that god takes care of us all we believe that god takes care of his children in the middle of the storm remember who are the ones god's responsible to his right those are the ones god according to the bible those are the ones god is responsible to are his if we belong to him then we have nothing to fear amen he takes care of us in the middle of the storm god takes care of his own now i want to get into a couple of different scenarios a couple of different stories in the scripture here one of them begins in genesis chapter 5. and i'm going to read them both together and talk about them synonymously genesis chapter 5 verse 21. hey man good to see everybody here on time today everybody okay with the 11 o'clock did that work okay everybody like that if you don't then you can feel feel free to speak up amen genesis chapter 5 verse 21 and enoch lived 60 and five years and begot methuselah enoch walked with god after he begot methuselah 300 years and begot sons and daughters all the days of enoch were 360 and five years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him boy that's a very simple one uh verse uh way to describe a rapture amen a catching away enoch walked with god and as he walked with god he was not because god took him amen that's a that that's a very brief very concise exact explanation of a catching away or rapture which is exactly what we're looking to to happen for us in this day amen to walk with god walking with god amen well i trust we're all walking with god as you walk with god and we're trusting and believing having faith in god there'll be a time as we walk with god that we will not be amen not here because god will catch us to go home now we'll have a warning amen we know that we're living in that season already but we will have a time because brother branham tells us that the loved ones that have gone before will resurrect from the dead and be with us for a minimum of 30 days right amen so we know we begin to see our loved ones we know what's happening and what the time frame is but we also know that when that happens christians we don't wait for that time to happen i said well i'll just wait for my loved one to appear and then i'll get ready well then you won't be ready right right and you probably won't see them anyway because if you're not ready you're probably not going to see them so we walk with god and we walk with god now and as we walk with god there'll be a time where we will not be because god will catch us away amen enoch a type of the bride amen thank you type of the bride now go over to genesis chapter 7. one page over for me 11 7 and 11. genesis 7 11. let's read the second story not read the whole story but in the sixth uh in the 600th year of noah's life in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day were all the foundations of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth 40 days and 40 nights in the self same day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth and the sons of noah the noah's wives and the three wives uh noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind every fowl after his kind every bird of every sword and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein the breath of life uh where is wherein is the breath of life and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded them and the lord shut him in the lord shut noah in the well all of them all they go in they are his family all the animals god closed the door brother branham was very explicit to help us understand god shut the door even if people came and banged on the door even after the judgment started and the rain was falling and they come and knocked on the door noah could not open the door because god shut the door when god shut the door that's the end of it no matter what anybody says no matter what anybody desires are imagine maybe noah's family was out there saying noah we believe you now open the door there's nothing noah could do about it right noah couldn't even let his own family in noah couldn't let his best friends in noah couldn't let anybody in nobody from his church couldn't let his pastor in nobody else could come in right it was him and his family and those animals that was it god shut the door it's only up to god whether god shut the door god opened the door that's god doing it amen now uh real briefly brother pat made this uh chart one time and we had several of them that we had the church and if any of you did not get a chart of this this is a chart of like from adam down to uh noah and his children to the flood if you want one of these i'm sure brother pat would be happy to make you more i can make you copies of this one uh can't do it today but if you don't have one you'd like one just let me know it shows the birth years and scripturally uh pat took the time to go through the book birth years and the birth of sons when they died and the flood and the scripture and everything on it so if you haven't got one of those charts you'd like to see it then uh uh you know feel free to ask me or brother pat i'm sure but uh but now we got the two stories we got enoch who is raptured which is the type of the bride and we've got noah who was shut in the ark by god which is a type of the church amen noah was a type of the church enoch was a type of the bride you understand noah went through the tribulation noah went through the storm but the bride enoch raptured before the tribulation could set in right so you understand the type here now and we see that noah of course what our uh uh noah was enoch's great great grandson i believe that's great great enoch had methuselah lamech and then noah is that great great or great great so a very quick descendant anyway which kind of reminds me of grandpa joe uh it really hit me this week they had grandpa joe's funeral this friday i called him grandpa joe as kind of an affectionate thing if he was if i was in his lineage he'd been about my grandfather so i always called him grandpa joe anyway i just realized this week he was my grandchildren's great great grandfather he was a double grade that doesn't happen a lot he was a double great to uh to my grandchildren so anyway enoch was the type of the bride noah the type of the church but enoch went in the rapture which is what the bride is going to do but noah went through the tribulation right and as noah went through that tribulation yeah he was saved god helped him and brought him through that but it but but enoch never even was here when the tribulation fell so if that's a type of what we're looking for today friend if that's the type of what's about to take place then this bride is getting herself ready to go on a rapture while the church is preparing itself to go through a tribulation look i'm not here to preach you through a tribulation i'm not here to preach you into a tribulation i'm here to try to get us ready by faith to go into a rapture for a bride of jesus christ now there's there's people there that's preparing themselves to go into a tribulation and that's fine if that's where they are in life and that's what their faith attributes them to then that there's not a thing in the world wrong with that but that's not what god sent me here to do right god didn't send me here to give you people to this congregation for me to talk you into how you're going in and through a tribulation right the bride doesn't go through the tribulation this bride leaves before the tribulation yes that's what the brought that's what the type that god is give us through a current day of present day message to help us understand where we're at for this day we're looking to go home we're looking for god to take us home in the middle of this present storm it's a time to have faith it's a time to believe god regardless of what we see taste phil smell here regardless of what the government's doing i had people send me stuff and i read stuff and i and in my head i i like oh my goodness what what's going on now and i look at something else i think my this uh this destruction over here and uh the the riots over there and and all the things that's happening and people losing their jobs i'm thinking what's going to be next and then god reminds me that is not your anointing right that is not what i called you to do i did not call you to fret and to worry over all the things that they're doing out there because i my kingdom is not of this world right right my kingdom your kingdom is not of this world god has called us to a different calling god has called us to a different anointing god has blessed us beyond that because we're the type of enoch and before that real tribulation hits this world we're going to be gone now i i feel the same way and sonja tells me all the time don't let it get to you it's so hard i was born in a time i told you before i was born in a time you might not have the same experience i was born at a time where i lived the life of a beaver cleaver people were decent people were honest right people i mean you know you couldn't completely believe people just by handshake but where i grew up and where i lived and my friends if if you were making a cake and you were lacking an egg you just walked next door and your neighbor gave you an egg and came over and helped you make the cake right i live within 15 feet of my neighbor now never hardly even talk to them or see them must let's buy an egg or a cup of milk or or something like that but it used to be that way all the time neighborhood kids we all played together it was nothing for me to get on my bike and run down this uh ride down a two-lane street four or five miles to go get a candy bar there's nothing to that now he's not my son but do you think if joel was in our care i would let him do that no way not even where i was born or grew up definitely not in tucson but not even where i was born or i wouldn't no way would i do that today i i we we sent our children to school but i don't know if i do that anymore right it has gotten so bad right and it's hard for me not to take it personally i try not to because i know where it's going i know where we're getting to i know what the storm is about and it's hard to find actually almost hard to find a decent honest person anymore i know they're out there i'm not saying there's not there's plenty of them out there i'm not trying to paint it like that with a broad brush but but it's the more you look it seems like the worse it gets right and and but it's supposed to get that way and it's hard for me not to take it personally it's hard for me not to get a little cynical when there's so much hypocrisy i think they say something here and they do it different over here right and and it's just it's just sometimes i'll be honest it gets the best of me it overtakes me even then god has to calm me down and remind me look that is not your anointing that is not what i set you here for i think it's good that you have a heart for people and i'm talking to you now a heart for people a love for people a desire to see the things that's right and like brother branham said that i read the quote he said but i know what's right and what's right and what's wrong see and when you see so much wrong it's hard not to speak out or say something but my voice the voice that god has given us is for his kingdom not this kingdom right we're we are not servants to fight for this kingdom right we are servants to fight for his kingdom that's what our anointing is that's what we're looking for today for his kingdom not this kingdom amen so our focus can't be on that our focus could has to be on his kingdom and where god is taking us with that where we're headed in that look at this the oncoming storm keeping in mind enoch and and noah here the scriptural type that we have for this last day they were finns uh finnish brother brandon was in the scandinavian country and they were having mixed bathing and all this and and uh couldn't understand why they were doing stuff like that and the women were uh touching the men and stuff anyway they said they were finns wonderful people but it's a spirit of the nation listen to this now spirit of the nation wherever you go you find the spirit of a nation and america has one too yes your brother brother brown said our our our spirit of this nation is frolic yes yes frolic that's what he said the spirit of america is frolic yeah entertainment is we just want to be entertained all the time right amen always joking i i it reminds me of uh and kind of puts it in perspective of the boy that's going through the graveyard at night whistling looking up was trying to convince himself he's not scared when he knows well he's scared walking through the graveyard the little boy he does he's i'm not scared no i'm not scared there's no ghosts around him okay you know he's scared and it's the same thing people do today they don't want to face reality they want to face truth and so what they do they just engulf themselves with all the entertainment they can find they're going to have one of the biggest entertainment events this country has in a whole year super bowl's taking place today that is nothing wrong super bowl that's all fine and dandy people have played their games and also under normal conditions they put 100 000 people in that stadium and however many millions are going to be watching it right i told you my favorite super bowl it's a big one full of food my favorite super bowl of food that's my favorite super bowl it's super sized bold nothing wrong with super bowl that's fine but you see it just shows you the spirit they'll put millions and millions even a billion dollars into building a stadium a place just to house them yep i mean we're blessed that god blessed us with this little humble place here on country club that god give us here don't take millions and millions even a billion dollars a huge stadium out here just watching people bump into each other so what does that show you it's that spirit that brother brown was talking about that's the spirit of america he said every nation has a spirit you come to america you've really got it then that's the worst of all and my wife said to me why these people go to church and i've often wondered why it didn't uh condemn their conscience i said my dear wife i'll let you know they're americans she said well aren't we he said oh no brother said oh no no i i he said no i said we just live here but we've been born from above amen amen the holy spirit comes upon us therefore we are pilgrims and strangers here this is not our abiding place but we are seeking a city to come whose builder and maker is gone amen amen so we're americans oh we live here yeah it's just like the spirit of the age this lail to see a church age well the church age is fine for the church but the bride has been called out of that church into a bright age she's living at a different time she's living in a different age she's been called out of that yes noah the church goes right through the tribulation but the bride goes home in a rapture she's been called out she's meant to be different she's meant to look different she's meant to walk different she's a higher walk than all the rest because god's calling her home right that's the whole point we're pilgrims strangers we're seeking a city that uh seeking a city to come whose builder maker is god therefore you are born of above you have the holy spirit coming down from god that changes your nature no matter your sister your mother your best friend can be dressed that way but the christian that's born of the spirit of god is born from above their spirit is of another kingdom amen now what jesus said of another kingdom right not of this kingdom of his kingdom our spirit is of their of his kingdom oh i'm so glad of that the simpleness of the holy spirit to follow it to watch it how it behaves makes you behave that's the way it was in the days of noah and god uh god got so filled up with it but before he sent a storm listen this now the anointing of the day is where we're living but before he sent a storm to destroy the entire world god made preparations for those who wanted to stay out of it amen god has already made preparations you believe that amen god has made preparations yes for the bride to stay out of it amen look friend when destruction was coming to sodom what did god do was life god went and sent two angels to go down and remember lot was not a type of the bride law was the type of the church because he went down into the world flirted with the world become the mayor's brother graham said call him the mayor of the city become a part of the city his wife became so engulfed in it that she couldn't even leave it when she walked out of it her heart was so much still in that world she turned around and god cursed her turn a pillar of saul but even when lot was calling lot came out of that city and of course you see the effects of lot even after god saved them that came out of the city and from him king moab and all that but even when even when the storm was coming god sent lot abraham's nephew to go down and call lot out of sodom before the destruction hit right now they had a choice they could state if they wanted but lot and his daughters left of course his wife did too but again she turned and she was in her heart that was the whole thing it was still in her heart so this was in her heart she turned and looked and she turned a pillar of salt the instruction was like brother dennis prayed obedience is better than sacrifice obedience is best period obey what it says it says don't turn around very much but it was too much in her heart she had to turn around and look we should turn around and look god cursed her she turned to a pillar of salt but even lot came out of that came out of the world but he was a type of the church but look at abraham who is a type of the bride yes he never was in the world to start with right he never even went down there he was out of it all together oh praise the lord you see where the bride is today you see where she is she's not even worried so much about that storm because she's not a part of the world amen amen the storm is going on in the world it's not going on in in in god's uh people right the storms going on in the world the storm isn't here with us the storm is in the world that's why we don't worry about that oh abraham was never even in the world he was never even a part of that he wasn't concerned about solomon being destroyed because he never was a part of sodom praise the lord amen i'm not worried about solomon being destroyed because i'm not a part of sodom amen amen glory to god god's called you out he sent a storm to destroy before he sends a storm to destroy the the entire world god made preparations for those she wanted out of it and i can see noah standing at the door of the ark preaching righteousness oh there wasn't many that would listen to him actually it's just his sons and daughter-in-laws and a few animals actually probably a lot of animals more animals and there were people right yeah my mind what does that tell you they were something like that today they want entertainment not the gospel woe unto these hollywood evangelists who is afraid to call sin sin right we need some of those old-fashioned backwoods preachers got the holy spirit that's not afraid to preach the gospel with their bare hands not covered up with some kind of rubber gloves but preach the coming of the lord jesus judgment for the wicked and heaven for the righteousness amen praise the lord trust those who live godly in christ jesus those are the ones that god is calling yes heaven for judgment for the wicked heaven for the righteous and they're near approaching what season i don't know no one else knows but i will warn my generation brother graham says i don't know he says but i will warn my generation amen praise the lord god now that's the anointing that god's given i will warn my generation amen seek higher ground whether it's higher ground yet to be found seek on an escape while there's an escape yet to be found right amen jesus christ is that only way of escape jesus christ is that only way out of that amen when moses was we talked about moses last week and remember the gross darkness that came at that time of that last judgment all those judgments that was on egypt israel wasn't part of that judgment right israel egypt was a part of that judgment not israel amen they were the ones in the world israel was god's people they were in egypt but they were called out of egypt because when the plagues hit god protected them yes and when the death angel came through that land it got grossly dark but right at the time of the darkest gross darkness hour came life this day the best sign that we have of the oncoming rapture is how dark it is outside because it's always the darkest before the light hits right we know that i mean that's every day the sun rises it's always darker before the sun hits in egypt it was at its gross darkness when that ain't death angel comes sweeping through the land but what did god do for his children he gave them a way of escape yes amen he got he gave them a way out yes what is our way out friend what is god called for us not a perpetual existence like like uh moses had moses had to have a perpetual existence even after they left egypt they continue to go on and on and on that's not the day that we live brother branham said you can't take moses noah couldn't take moses message or moses knows we can't take uh uh elijah's message uh it's a different time that we're living in today yes uh the the message that he had for that day what would it do for us to go outside and build an ark in the back parking lot build a big huge boat get all the animals come in that's not that's not for us today right we're not going through a tribulation this bride does not go through the tribulation this day is a going home time yes this day is the time that god's calling his bride home to be with him moses yes god made provision when when elijah was running from running from jezebel and ahab mainly jezebel she's the one that threatened his life when elijah was running he had no strength god did what god fed him he went down and said under the juniper tree and said god just kill me right i'm done i'm the only one left there's nobody else here but me lord just take me home i'm done i'm spent just just take me just kill me now god told him said elijah i got 7 000 having bowed the knee to baal 7 000 but what did god do god sent him strength he sent him angel's food amen he sent him angels food he sent him a uh he sent him a cake by an angel right amen you want some strengthening food today just take a tape from that angel and pop it in listen amen that'll give you strength yes give your spiritual strength that's the anointing that we have for today that god gives us spiritual strength but elijah was in strength but god blessed him god took care of him god took care of moses god took care of abraham a lot amen and he'll take care of you he always does yes amen look now taking sides with jesus he says you remember what that dream that i got the interpretation was he says the interpretation of the dream that brother branham got he said was go back and store up food that's what he said go back and store up food where was the storehouse the tabernacle yeah or of this tabernacle as he was standing at jeffersonville in the branham tabernacle he said this tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country anywhere uh around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have amen so what was the food that we have now of course our little brother sisters here uh scott out long these other little churches are here we're one we would uh uh we would where would you go to to find it so it's anywhere you go right out in denominational creeds you'll go right away from the name of the lord jesus you'll go right away from these other things see and here is where the food has been stored up well one message uh one message that i preach here look i've been preaching from one to six hours on a message well if i had the use of one of those message i'd take a week to take it to preach it uh just a little bit here just a little bit there see because it's been being stored up here amen the food of the vision that god gave brother branham was to store the food at the brown tabernacle what was the food it's on the tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes where people are in their houses then tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of god amen praise the lord lord and will feed us and continues to feed us the food that was stored up according to the vision god gave brother branham amen amen in the hands of a predestinated god he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back to do this was to store up that food that food the spiritual food what did we talk about the other day this is not a natural battle he is not biden he is not trump he is not kamala harris he is not the leader of russia china iran uh north korea he is a spiritual being amen it is in incarnating itself in an office and this mark of the beast that we've been so talking about that's causing to bring upon the people total control and you see that control you see things i've seen i've seen people do things i never would imagine they would do just because of the control of the government right i i'm serious and people and the way they talk and will shame you if you don't do it exactly the way they think it should be done will make you look like a fool or idiot or even put you in jail poor women poor woman went to watch her son play football and they arrested her standing in the stands all by herself no more than 10 15 feet of her didn't have a mask they arrested her put her in jail because she wanted to watch her son play football what's he gotten to that's just one very mild example of a lot of the things that's going on today amen that happened four or five months ago you say oh that's by no it wasn't that was when trump was still president amen but the clamping down of the states is especially certain ones uh that's where it really came from it was the state and the governor that was doing it you look at the total control the president doesn't have the right to do a lot of the things he's doing now right bush didn't have the right obama didn't trump didn't and biden doesn't had the right to do a lot of the things they're doing today they write hundreds of executive orders forget congress why do we even need a legislative branch anymore why do we even need a constitution well they'll tell you that democrats don't believe in any they don't want it anymore most people young people in their 20s don't believe in the first amendment so what's the point in having it there was a republican brought up an example in congress i believe was the house of representatives and he said we should say the pledge of allegiance before we start our sessions and the democrats laughed at him where has he gotten to control to keep control over you to try to control people because that's what the revelation 13 is all about right controlling the people amen controlling the people but remember that mark of the beast is a spiritual mark and before that thing comes on you friend this bride goes we're not a part of revelation 13 not that part of it anyway right we go home we're not a part of that amen amen god god takes care of his own yes he does believe that yeah god takes care of his own let me read a couple more here and i'm going to close amen the oncoming storm again is quotes from the oncoming storm walk in the light of the gospel which will bring you warmth oh how comfortable it is to see the oncoming judgments and to feel listen now to see the oncoming judgments and we see them they're plain as they can be amen we recognize them every day as we feel that pull to the lord every day we see that oncoming judgments and feel that comfort feeling of the holy spirit feeling the comfortable feeling of the holy spirit even though you know that the destruction is hidden hear them talk of atomic bombs and just think what has happened a peace that passes understanding yes amen think of nuclear bombs new and all the warfare and warheads and whatever but to think of the peace that passes all understanding why the bomb won't no more go off of the gun until we'll be in the presence of jesus hallelujah yes you want to talk about a total of destruction of this nation oh yeah we know border border coast to coast brother graham said it would be but brother amber said for one bullet could leave one gun this bride's going to be in the presence of jesus christ amen hallelujah we're not a part of that friend we'll be in the presence of jesus with eternal life we old people back uh young again the babies up to an age no more death or sorrow oh what a wonderful thing you mean a man would refuse to come out and walk in that there is something wrong with him finally if he doesn't get the sunlight he turns pale and gets real sick uh six sets in on him that's what's the matter with the world today that's what's the matter with most of our churches today not enough light not enough so in light amen they might have plenty of the sunlight the s.o in light is in uh rare is hard to find right short supply that's what i was trying to say the s-o-n like short supply that's what's matter with most of our churches today and if they were if it was that way with most of churches in 1960 what are we talking about 50 uh 50 60 years now from from then 61 almost so what is it now oh my friend what's the matter with them see we are becoming anemia we need a blood transfusion bale pale because we are failing our spiritual health is failing we don't have the zeal no more to hunt souls to warn people to get our neighbors friends milkman paperboy you should be a milkman and paperboy in those days whatever it is get someone to the lord jesus we're pale failing to walk out in the light what is our privilege failing to believe in the health of god by divine healing i'm told in the bible that there will come a time for those who are not in this wonderful s-o-n light that the fowls of the air will eat the flesh of them that diseases is on its road that the doctors will never be able to stop it's the plagues of god yes but what did brother bam say the bride will be out amen gone the egyptian doctors which is far more smarter than our doctors today could not stop the plagues of god neither could their soothsayers or their impersonators it took goshen and the power of god to hold his people under the blood of the lamb the holy spirit is the doctrine the holy spirit is the door today the holy spirit is that safety today amen amen praise the lord what better time to say it's time to get into christ yeah brother dennis said time to quit playing church amen i'm not talking to you so much as a congregation whoever might see this or whoever we might talk to but friend it's time to stop playing church amen playing church time is over fence riding time's over this is the end of it yes we're at that is well brother newton i've heard that for years you'll hear it for the last time one of these days this may be that last time right this may be the last time i ever say it god have mercy maybe if there's still a little mercy there's still a little more time amen but there'll be a time where god will shut the door and there will be nobody else come in nobody else come in brother abraham said there'll be a time here on this earth the bride will still be here and there will be no flesh be able to be saved right nobody amen go back and read souls in prison amen oncoming storm we see the newspapers the oncoming storm when you go home tonight do me a favor don't go to bed until you read revelation the eighth chapter you see the oncoming plagues and storm that'll hit this earth thunders lightness going to shake the heaven woes are going to pass over the nation man will rot in their flesh diseases will strike them and doctors know nothing about it but remember before that took place always keep that in mind saints of god amen before that took place there was a ceiling that went forth yes and the death angels and the plagues was commissioned by god don't come near any of those who had the seal in their forehead the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption no matter how hard the ark rock no matter how many times the latin the lightning struck close to it ten thousand shall fall on your right uh uh thousands to your left but it shall come it shall not come nigh thee amen because of the holy spirit amen you know my prayer my prayer for us for this congregation god's hedge of protection yes the angels encamped around about us amen keep us protected to guard over us to watch over us i said the other day i said god if there is one of those germs diseases come and tries to penetrate that angel barrier you get that angel with his flaming sword and move him back amen yes i believe that yes praise the lord it shall not come nigh thee i read of a pale horse rider going out what's he called death and death and hell followed him black horse rider with the balance's hand a measure wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny but don't so we read this i believe this last week or the week before don't come near my oil and wine amen don't touch my oil in my my oil and wine his his bride is anointed i hear my bible i hear by the bible god's coming judgments where sickness and trouble disaster will strike the nations and every nation will break to pieces now a couple more here i'm closing to finish this up there's only one provided way by god for anything there won't be one building setting by another one in chicago one of these days or nowhere else god is fixing to reign out fixing to rain out that sixth seal upon the earth which we know is tribulation about to rain out that sick seal upon the earth break that seal and turn loose the wrath of god upon the earth but before he does that the church will be gone amen amen the church will be gone the bride will be gone the church the bride will be gone the church won't she'll go through the tribulation church will go through the tribulation but the bride will go in the rapture his little wife won't go through that amen one more feast of the trumpets he said what has it done in the cunningness he said he come in like flatteries that's what he had done he's bringing the he's bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not the denominations but upon the bride amen but here now they're loosed upon the bride 200 000 000 demons or 200 million demons loosed upon the bride but now what does brother branham say but here you get it the bride will not go through that time the bible says not the church will but the bride will not amen she can't so you see the different anointings in the world today you see the different things that's going on there's a group of people that are readying themselves to go into and through a tribulation but there's a smaller group of people that are ready and preparing themselves to go in a rapture i'm a part of that group yes i believe you're a part of that group every one of you here may be watching you're a part of that group going into rapture of course now all the others a lot of them think they're going into rapture too but they're preparing themselves for a tribulation oh we're going in the rapture but preparing for tribulation brother graham says the bible says we will not go through that time amen people say ministers say he says he said the bride the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it reverend says the blood of the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride of christ have to be purified to go through some uh a tribulation to be purified god the blood of christ has already purified her amen a man who chooses a wife look now i like this quote i use this a lot when people talk about the squeeze but he said a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace in her are with her she's found grace with him if he's found grace with her why does he marry her just to beat her up oh i love you honey wait till we get home i'll carry you across the threshold but as soon as i get that that's just silliness right that's foolishness but there's people that believe that spiritually about god and his pride oh i love you brian and i made all these provisions for you and i love you but i'm going to pound you into the ground oh there's going to be a rapture but i'm going to beat the tar out of you before then that that doesn't even make any common sense that's scriptural sense god doesn't do that i'm going to make you suffer before you have to come home why does the bride have to suffer when jesus has already suffered for her yes why does she have to go through that when god's already gone through it for her why does she have to experience that when he already experienced it on her behalf he took my place so i could take his amen that's the only way i could be robed in his righteousness and not have a spot wrinkle or blemish because of his blood because of what he's done well if he's done it then why do i have to go through it right the bride's not going through it friend no matter what people might say no matter what others might teach the bible says the bride does not go through that time yes brother madam says by the word authority of the word the bride does not go through that time amen amen she's not going through that time god takes care of his own hallelujah amen god provides for his own god will bless us amen god didn't god didn't choose you just to beat you up a while he chose you because he loved you amen he chose you because he found you not worthy but worthy in him by predestination in the mind of christ he came to redeem those that were redeemable he came to save those that were his from their sins if he went through the punishment then why do i have to be punished now i'm not saying there's not going to be some things that we might have to uh go through to get into christ or not into christ but uh in the position we're supposed to be in uh there's things that's going to happen in this world but god's god's calling this bride out of that i believe god's calling this bride out of that before before one of those bombs leaves a hangar god's gonna take this bride home yes before the great tribulation of those tribulations that hits this world god's gonna take her home he's not gonna make you suffer right his blood has already purified and cleansed us of all unrighteousness amen amen made us like his and our bodies like his own glorious body because he has called us out of this we're not a part of the world we're not we're not a part of the church we're part of the bride right right we're the type of enoch not the type of noah god has called this bride to a to a higher walk to a higher plane to to a different realm to a word that's brought her into a living presence of god himself amen amen that's what i'm looking for saying this that's what my whole um this present storm his present storm going around the world today the world is all engulfed in all of that that's going on but you know they don't even recognize it's a storm they don't even realize the storm's going on most of them just think oh it's business as usual right i used to hear when i was a kid oh well the next music well you know my parents said our music was that bad too and your parents will say your music's that bad too what does that tell you if it's getting worse then it's getting worse it don't matter who tells who right and it's so ungodly today kill police rape women they're not even not even musicians they just can't yell about all kinds of stuff that's about as ungodly as you can get right covers from head to toe in in markings that can never come off pierced everywhere and everywhere and and a hairdos i don't want to talk about you
