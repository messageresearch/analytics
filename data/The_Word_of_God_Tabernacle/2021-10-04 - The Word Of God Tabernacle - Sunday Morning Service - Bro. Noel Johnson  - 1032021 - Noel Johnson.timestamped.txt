[30:45] [Music]
[30:53] i want to greet you all in the name of
[30:55] the lord jesus christ
[30:57] thank you for coming out this morning
[31:00] you know it's nice when you know who's
[31:01] going to be preaching and you come
[31:02] anyway that's why that's always nice
[31:06] well you're standing if we open our
[31:08] bibles to galatians the fourth chapter
[31:10] we'll read verses three through seven
[31:16] i was i was praying what i was what to
[31:20] what to bring and the lord put on my
[31:22] heart
[31:22] and the title of this
[31:24] sermon if i could call it that and
[31:26] because you're sons
[31:28] and hopefully that'll make some sense as
[31:30] we get into this
[31:34] so in galatians the fourth chapter
[31:36] reading verses three through seven
[31:39] it says even so we when we were children
[31:41] were in bondage
[31:42] but when the fullness of time was come
[31:44] god sent forth his son made every woman
[31:46] made under the law
[31:48] to redeem them they were under the law
[31:49] that we might receive the adoption of
[31:51] sons
[31:53] and because ye are sons god hath speared
[31:55] every son unto your hearts crying abba
[31:57] father
[31:59] wherefore there are no more servant but
[32:00] a son
[32:02] and of a son than an heir of god even
[32:04] through christ
[32:05] and let's pray
[32:08] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[32:10] father it is always our privilege
[32:12] to gather ourselves together with one
[32:14] heart one mind and one accord
[32:17] and then to offer up unto you songs of
[32:19] worship and praise lord because they
[32:21] came from our heart
[32:23] but lord now it's come the time when
[32:24] we've quietened ourselves to
[32:26] sit at your feet and receive what it is
[32:28] you'd have for us this morning
[32:30] the lord you've chosen to speak through
[32:32] men and so lord i stand before the
[32:34] purchase of your blood
[32:36] yes the lord let it be your words and
[32:38] not mine
[32:39] take the thoughts that you've given me
[32:41] lord and express them to the people yes
[32:43] the lord we all might be blessed i pray
[32:46] for i ask it in jesus precious name
[32:49] amen amen you can be seated
[32:55] what it says here in in in galatians it
[32:57] says because your son
[33:00] yes we're not in the world
[33:03] we never were a part of the world amen
[33:06] i mean we were born into the world okay
[33:07] we give you that
[33:12] but too often we keep looking at
[33:14] ourselves as being in the world part of
[33:16] the world and we deal with the world
[33:18] as we would deal with them in our flesh
[33:21] in our human in our humanity
[33:24] but yet
[33:25] what god has been trying to get
[33:28] across at least to me
[33:30] is don't think about yourself don't
[33:32] think in the physical realm
[33:34] but rise above that level
[33:37] and begin to recognize really what you
[33:39] are
[33:41] children of this world you are you are
[33:43] sons and daughters of god right yes and
[33:46] we have to change our thinking our whole
[33:49] approach to life has to change
[33:51] it says in john the first chapter but as
[33:53] many as received him to them gave me the
[33:55] power to become the sons of god even to
[33:57] them that believe on his name
[34:00] which were born not of the will of the
[34:01] flesh
[34:02] nor the will of man
[34:05] but of god
[34:06] you came into this world because you're
[34:08] a part of god from the beginning
[34:11] and you came because god ordained for
[34:13] you to come
[34:15] now yes
[34:16] i understand in in running relay races
[34:19] they
[34:20] they always save the best for last
[34:23] so you may not think of yourself in that
[34:25] capacity but you're the best
[34:27] god save the best for last and he said
[34:30] we have a calling on our life it doesn't
[34:32] matter with your housewife or gas
[34:33] station attendant or whatever you might
[34:35] be that has that has no relevance amen
[34:38] you are here for a specific purpose for
[34:41] the for the sole purpose of manifesting
[34:43] and expressing the word
[34:45] for this generation
[34:46] and now you now it's up to us to fulfill
[34:50] the remainder of that
[34:52] and
[34:53] because he expressed it that way
[34:54] obviously that that's the way we look at
[34:56] it
[34:57] we are afraid to acknowledge
[34:59] and come to the realization we are
[35:02] sons and daughters of god amen we are
[35:05] afraid to step into that position we are
[35:07] afraid to step into that authority where
[35:09] we have we are afraid we're we're afraid
[35:11] all of a sudden
[35:12] we're afraid to take god at his word
[35:15] and begin to live the life that god has
[35:17] ordained for us to live
[35:19] we are to be the final manifestation of
[35:21] god to this world praise the lord the
[35:23] rapture is upon us the rapture is
[35:25] already in progress
[35:26] but there is a there's a function we
[35:28] have to fulfill
[35:30] but we cannot fulfill that if we're
[35:32] walking in our flesh and thinking of
[35:33] ourselves as flesh
[35:36] we we have to come to the realization he
[35:38] says get away from this hearing this guy
[35:39] he says you don't know who you are
[35:41] you are not going to be but now you are
[35:43] the sons of god
[35:44] see you always were the sons of god
[35:47] he said before even be uh he became
[35:50] material here on earth before there was
[35:52] anything but god he says you were in it
[35:54] you were in his you were you're one of
[35:56] his attributes
[35:57] you are an expression of god amen amen
[36:03] you are an expression
[36:04] you may not think of yourself in that
[36:06] way
[36:07] but you are you are a manifestation of
[36:09] god from the face of this earth amen god
[36:11] had you in his thinking god had had a
[36:13] plan for your life
[36:15] and so when you came into manifestation
[36:17] god sat there and he's organized you he
[36:19] he has gone through your life he has put
[36:22] things in your path to train you to
[36:24] become what you are if you will it's
[36:26] time to actually step into the full
[36:27] expression of god himself that lives in
[36:30] us
[36:30] praise the lord
[36:32] yes
[36:33] when right last
[36:35] sunday i guess that was when i
[36:36] ministered here we talked about romans 5
[36:38] 1-2
[36:39] therefore being justified by faith we
[36:41] have peace with god through our lord
[36:42] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[36:44] by faith under this grace when we stand
[36:46] and rejoice in the hope of the glory of
[36:48] god
[36:49] we read that oh yeah that sounds nice
[36:52] but in what do we struggle
[36:54] we look at ourselves
[36:56] we look at our flesh
[36:58] we look at our faults we look at all the
[37:00] things that we should think we should be
[37:02] doing and we know we never measure up
[37:05] but see god knew this yes
[37:07] this is not a surprise to him
[37:09] coping 19 is not a surprise to him
[37:12] our president minister government
[37:14] administration
[37:15] america has to be destroyed america has
[37:18] to fall we have the perfect
[37:19] administration to accomplish that
[37:21] they're doing an excellent job they're
[37:23] doing an excellent job
[37:24] but we have to we said being justified
[37:27] justified when the brother brought him
[37:30] justified he says it's as if you have
[37:32] never sinned
[37:34] amen and that's how he looks at you
[37:38] you are sinless amen you say but i make
[37:41] mistakes welcome to the club
[37:43] no but you and god's eyes are sinless
[37:45] and if god declares you to be sinless
[37:47] then you are sinless at least in his
[37:49] eyes
[37:50] when abraham and god finally looked at
[37:52] him and abraham believed god and god
[37:54] counted him put it amen even when he
[37:57] laughed at god even when he he had given
[37:59] to him all in all the problems that
[38:01] abraham had yet god never regarded him
[38:03] anything other than righteousness
[38:06] when you accept jesus christ because you
[38:08] are in christ because the blood of jesus
[38:11] christ covers you because you you are
[38:13] integrated into that body
[38:15] god declares you are righteous amen he
[38:18] always regards you as righteous
[38:21] he does not look at your shortcomings he
[38:23] does not look at your faults he doesn't
[38:24] look at your failures he regards you as
[38:26] righteous he looks upon you the same way
[38:29] he looks upon himself you are a sinless
[38:31] and as pure and virtuous as god himself
[38:34] that's how he views you
[38:37] but you have to accept it
[38:40] it's not just it can't just be nice
[38:42] words
[38:43] and they can't be oh yeah we
[38:48] yeah well that's nice it sounds nice but
[38:50] unless you believe it
[38:52] yes
[38:53] it doesn't do you any good
[38:55] if if all of a sudden somebody send you
[38:57] a check for a million dollars oh that's
[38:59] pretty i like the paint isn't it isn't
[39:01] it pretty checked isn't it look at those
[39:03] numbers on there oh isn't that nice
[39:04] isn't that nice until you take it to the
[39:06] bank it's just a piece of paper
[39:09] but once you take it to the bank then
[39:11] you can use it
[39:12] once you take the word of god and you
[39:14] begin to apply it to yourself and you
[39:16] take it to the bank of heaven and all of
[39:18] a sudden he says you are you declared
[39:19] i'm righteous i got false and failures
[39:21] but you yourself have said i'm righteous
[39:23] and i'm here at your service to do what
[39:25] you want me to do once you take it to
[39:26] the bank of heaven and you cash it then
[39:28] you can use it
[39:30] but that takes faith
[39:32] you have to actually believe
[39:34] that what that verse says
[39:36] it means amen
[39:40] brother branham in the first seal
[39:43] he says how can a man how can a man say
[39:46] that the bride of christ
[39:48] goes into tribulation she took away from
[39:50] the tribulation
[39:53] if the church has been judged and they
[39:55] have judged themselves and have accepted
[39:57] the blood
[39:58] how can god judge a man that's perfect
[40:01] that's perfectly totally sinless
[40:04] amen
[40:06] okay
[40:07] all right
[40:08] he said you say there's no such person
[40:10] every born-again believer true believer
[40:13] is perfectly absolutely sinless before
[40:15] god yes because he's not trusting in his
[40:18] works
[40:20] in the but in the blood of jesus christ
[40:22] praise the lord you cannot trust in
[40:24] yourself
[40:26] it's like we we went over in habakkuk
[40:28] you know the man who whose soul is
[40:30] lifted up or something like that the guy
[40:31] who trusts in himself god won't even
[40:33] help him god won't even regard him
[40:35] but the just shall live by his faith and
[40:38] that faith is not believing for
[40:39] something no it's actually believing in
[40:42] someone
[40:43] it's believing that god himself has
[40:45] declared you to be this and you have
[40:46] come to a relationship with jesus christ
[40:49] with yeah with jesus christ
[40:51] where you walk with him you talk with
[40:53] him he's your best friend he's your best
[40:54] buddy like one of the songs says you
[40:56] know not only are you king but you also
[40:58] are my brother and so i forget the word
[41:01] of the song
[41:02] but we have to come to this
[41:05] because your son
[41:07] amen
[41:08] because your daughters
[41:11] because you are a part of god from the
[41:12] beginning
[41:13] yes now you're here
[41:15] and god is wanting to do something
[41:17] through you
[41:18] but you have to believe who god says you
[41:21] are
[41:21] yes
[41:23] that's true
[41:24] amen
[41:25] he goes on he that's born of god does
[41:27] not commit sin
[41:29] for he cannot sin
[41:31] how can you make a man a sinner when the
[41:33] bleach of the blood of jesus christ is
[41:35] between him
[41:36] and god yes yes
[41:40] you're sinless because the blood's there
[41:43] once you cross brother branham talks
[41:45] about yeah there's this ring of blood
[41:47] around around the earth so to speak and
[41:49] he says as long as that blood is there
[41:51] he says it covers it protects
[41:54] but once you pass beyond calvary but if
[41:56] you have not accepted jesus christ as
[41:58] your savior you pass beyond that veil
[42:01] no you're condemned
[42:02] because you refuse to accept the only
[42:05] provision god has made for salvation
[42:08] but we've accepted it
[42:10] we have accepted the blood of jesus
[42:12] christ we have accepted calvary we have
[42:14] accepted what god has done for us there
[42:16] therefore regard how god regards you
[42:18] amen
[42:22] he says jesus said to be therefore
[42:24] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[42:25] perfect
[42:27] have you ever thought of that god is
[42:29] perfect
[42:31] i mean he's perfectly sinless and i mean
[42:33] you know how how would y'all explain him
[42:36] and he said be perfect be the same
[42:37] perfect as my as the father is
[42:41] well how is that possible
[42:44] he said he said
[42:46] he said but jesus required it if jesus
[42:48] required it he's got to make a way for
[42:50] it
[42:51] and he has
[42:52] his own blood
[42:54] it's not about you
[43:11] and accept what god has said that you
[43:13] are amen
[43:15] he says invisible union he says he the
[43:17] bridegroom took away your shame in the
[43:19] sea of forgetfulness by the washing of
[43:21] the water by the word and in the in the
[43:23] blood of life that's what that's what
[43:25] the bible said he said your first
[43:27] husband that you're married to which is
[43:28] the world
[43:29] he said that it was a dog it's done away
[43:32] yes you're no longer married you no
[43:34] longer have to obey your flesh
[43:38] you no longer have to obey you no longer
[43:40] have to be controlled by the by the evil
[43:42] powers
[43:43] you can rise above that
[43:45] but you have to believe this yes
[43:48] you have to believe that yeah when i
[43:50] accepted christ as my savior when i went
[43:52] into the waters and i was baptized what
[43:54] did i do i buried the old man and i rose
[43:57] in a new man i rose to newness of life i
[43:59] rose to a life in which i served god
[44:03] it wasn't immediate oh no
[44:06] but slowly over time god took away this
[44:08] and he took away that he took away this
[44:09] he took away that what was he doing he
[44:12] was molding he was changing me from the
[44:13] inside
[44:15] no longer lived by by by a law which has
[44:18] been written on tables of stone he says
[44:20] but now he's taken and written into our
[44:21] hearts and our mind where literally it
[44:23] becomes a part of us
[44:25] we live the word we live the law because
[44:27] now it's our nature to live that law
[44:31] you do that all the time well no
[44:34] but more and more in the life that
[44:35] you're living you can you should be have
[44:37] seen a change in in your life completely
[44:39] justified as though you never did in the
[44:41] beginning
[44:42] this is my message to the church now
[44:46] brother branham prayed that in 65
[44:48] invisible union
[44:49] this is my message to the church now
[44:52] why you have to believe this that you
[44:54] that you never sin from the beginning
[44:56] that you are standing totally and you
[44:58] are the virtue of sin the bride of the
[44:59] lord jesus to give to us
[45:02] this is how god regards you he says this
[45:04] is my message to the church now he says
[45:07] it's as if you had never sinned
[45:10] amen so that is how god regardless why
[45:12] did god send the prophet
[45:14] to tell the bride who she is
[45:17] and to make us come to the realization
[45:19] there is a there is something that the
[45:21] bride itself must fulfill
[45:24] and he said this this is my message to
[45:25] the church now he said amen every god
[45:27] every child where you're studying i'm
[45:28] trying to tell you
[45:30] i'm trying
[45:40] pull away from what you learned in the
[45:42] baptist church and pentecostal church
[45:44] and whatever other churches you might
[45:45] have been a part of i know i had a
[45:47] friend of mine lonnie jenkins
[45:49] and and i would listen to other
[45:51] ministers minister and i struggled i
[45:53] says
[45:54] why can they come to the revelation that
[45:56] they have
[45:58] and i agree with everything they're
[45:59] saying that i cannot i cannot make the
[46:01] transition
[46:02] so i spent a week with him and we talked
[46:04] and we talked he says well i know what
[46:06] your problem is
[46:08] you're trying to take the word of god
[46:09] and you're trying to take this message
[46:11] and filter it through what you learn the
[46:12] baptist church and the assemblies of god
[46:15] yeah he said you can't do that
[46:17] right
[46:19] well how do you do it
[46:20] i take what brother adam said
[46:23] i go back into the word and i find where
[46:25] he said it
[46:28] his theology the things that he learned
[46:30] in different churches and stuff he
[46:32] didn't rely upon his own intellect he
[46:33] didn't rely upon the commentaries
[46:35] although i read the commentary because
[46:37] sometimes he gives me another trait of
[46:39] thought which i would not have thought
[46:40] of otherwise and then i go back to the
[46:42] message and go back into the word and
[46:44] because i have to substantiate it in
[46:45] that but it comes down to the place you
[46:47] cannot you cannot rely on what you've
[46:49] been taught
[46:50] you have to rely upon what god was
[46:52] trying to tell us through the prophet
[46:54] that is the whole reason why god sent
[46:56] him amen
[46:58] he said you're standing complete
[47:00] justified like you never did in the
[47:02] first place you are the pure virtuous
[47:05] sinless bride of the son of the living
[47:06] god every man and woman that's born of
[47:08] the spirit of god and worship in the
[47:10] blood of jesus christ and believes every
[47:11] word of god stands as though you never
[47:13] sinned in the first place yes
[47:15] amen
[47:17] that's what you are
[47:18] yourself
[47:21] brother brown says amen and so don't
[47:23] look at yourself
[47:24] don't look at your fault from church
[47:25] comings and all the things that that
[47:27] because of your humanity
[47:29] yes no look at what god said because
[47:32] only as you can only as you begin to
[47:34] accept what god says you are can you
[47:37] actually begin to have the faith to be
[47:38] able to operate what god is trying to
[47:40] get us to operate in today amen
[47:43] it goes on in hebrews 3 and 1 it says
[47:45] wherefore holy brother partakers are the
[47:47] heavenly caller consider the apostle
[47:49] high priest of our profession christ
[47:51] jesus it's interesting in went into into
[47:54] a commentary
[47:56] it says wherefore holy brethren
[47:58] he said the apostle calls the hebrews
[48:00] brethren
[48:01] not because them you can feel their
[48:03] feelings and all the other things that
[48:05] go with it like i'm saying i'm not
[48:07] related to anybody in the physical sense
[48:09] to the ones in india
[48:11] no but they're my family amen because we
[48:13] all have the same father
[48:15] so we said on a fellowship because our
[48:17] father was the same spirit is there to
[48:19] working amongst us and oh my god so we
[48:20] we enter into with each other i mean
[48:22] it's like we've known him all of our
[48:24] lives
[48:24] amen
[48:29] the restoration of the bridegroom says
[48:32] you're going to form what's known to me
[48:34] as a bride
[48:36] you will be part you will be part of me
[48:39] you'll be my bride
[48:40] my life will be in your body
[48:43] just just like husband and wife as one
[48:45] person you and i are going to be are
[48:47] going to be one
[48:48] and there you'll know that i am the
[48:50] father the fathers of me i and you and
[48:51] you and me
[48:52] oh i just love that and satan gets so
[48:55] angry at that see the oneness of god
[49:00] do you understand the implication of
[49:02] what he just said there
[49:04] we are an expression of god yes
[49:08] in one sense we're part of the godhead
[49:10] because it's all the same
[49:12] we're an attribute we're an expression
[49:20] it makes us all related one to the other
[49:23] we are part of the godhead in in in the
[49:26] sense that brother brad and put it here
[49:29] because we are an expression
[49:31] we are an attribute we are a
[49:32] manifestation of god all that god was
[49:34] reporting to christ all the christ was
[49:36] he poured into the church there you are
[49:38] god speaking through him to us okay
[49:41] he says now look now the bride the bride
[49:43] are one tree of life in other words like
[49:45] husband and wife is one christ in the
[49:47] bride they are one same thing same
[49:49] spirit
[49:50] same words
[49:51] same signs everything else for the works
[49:54] that i do shall you do also
[49:56] you see well how can i do the work for
[49:58] god
[49:59] you allow god to do it through you
[50:03] it's not up to you to produce praise
[50:06] it's about up to you to yield yourself
[50:08] to god
[50:10] so that god can in his sovereignty can
[50:12] brother branham never performed one
[50:14] miracle
[50:15] he said i was just standing there when
[50:16] the angel came down yeah yeah well i had
[50:19] in discernment i was just standing there
[50:20] and god used my voice
[50:22] well this miracle happened i just
[50:24] happened to be standing there when god
[50:25] did this and i just happened to be
[50:26] standing there when god did that
[50:29] brethren that i have look at how god how
[50:31] i'm able to sit there and tell you the
[50:32] secrets of your heart
[50:34] he never went that route
[50:36] never once
[50:38] i just happened to be there and god
[50:39] decided to do it amen
[50:41] well what about in our lives
[50:44] when all of a sudden that somebody has a
[50:46] knee and all of a sudden the anointing
[50:47] falls on you you see all the anointing
[50:49] is just for the ministers no it's not
[50:51] every member of the body of the light of
[50:52] jesus christ when god's spirit comes and
[50:55] anoints you he anoints you for a purpose
[50:58] he anoints you to pray for someone he
[51:00] anoints you to speak to someone he he
[51:02] leads and guides your path so that all
[51:03] of a sudden somebody is in need and what
[51:05] do you do all of a sudden god puts the
[51:07] words in in your mind and speaks them
[51:09] out through your voice
[51:11] and you say where did that come from it
[51:13] was god you meant a man
[51:15] it was god doing
[51:17] right
[51:18] true brother be moved
[51:21] and he questioned that yeah
[51:23] and so the angel of god was i'm
[51:25] paraphrasing okay but the angel said in
[51:27] him well he says when you're in
[51:28] discernment who's speaking
[51:30] oh that's god speaking
[51:32] god's just using your voice
[51:34] what happens when a minister is standing
[51:36] and all of a sudden another thought
[51:38] comes into his head and he goes along
[51:40] that rabbit trail
[51:42] who's speaking
[51:43] amen it's god speaking
[51:46] it's god speaking to the needs of the
[51:47] individual
[51:48] i can take the same note and i can
[51:50] preach it ten times and it always comes
[51:52] out different
[51:53] because the need of the people in front
[51:55] of me is different than
[51:56] than in every single congregation
[51:59] because god puts in in our in our
[52:01] thinking and he says and he says you
[52:03] have to be able to preach it no it's god
[52:05] speaking amen
[52:06] if you will accept it as god speaking
[52:08] through him it'll do you some good
[52:11] yeah
[52:12] oh yeah that's just a password he's just
[52:13] mouthing off again just you know
[52:15] no no no you have to accept it as god
[52:18] yes yes
[52:19] why do we accept what brother branham
[52:21] has to say as as god speaking through
[52:23] him amen i'm not saying that every word
[52:25] brother is trying to say that but when
[52:27] you begin to look at the thought pattern
[52:29] that god is trying to express through
[52:31] him
[52:32] he's trying to tell you something
[52:35] god is speaking through him you are the
[52:37] pure virtuous
[52:38] sinless bride of jesus christ
[52:43] well that was just the prophet
[52:45] if you say that was just a prophet fine
[52:46] and it's just words
[52:47] but no that's god speaking
[52:50] if you can accept that
[52:52] that's different
[52:53] god's telling me i am the pure virtuous
[52:56] sinner's bride of jesus christ i am
[52:58] totally justified in his presence it's
[53:00] as if i never have sinned
[53:02] god is telling me that
[53:05] well if i can accept that as being god
[53:07] speaking to me
[53:09] that changes my
[53:10] priesthood my whole concept of things
[53:19] and by whom are all things and bringing
[53:21] many sons into glory to make the captive
[53:23] of their salvation perfect through
[53:24] suffering
[53:25] jesus christ was the one who created all
[53:27] things and for his pleasure they are and
[53:29] were created yes so it's talking about
[53:31] for it became him who is him this is
[53:34] jesus christ he became all things wife
[53:37] so that he could go and he could pay the
[53:38] price of redemption for for god's
[53:41] children amen
[53:45] for god for you
[53:48] he died on the cross for you
[53:51] it has to be a personal revelation to
[53:53] you
[53:54] when you accepted jesus christ as your
[53:56] savior did you realize that jesus christ
[53:58] hung on the cross for you do you realize
[54:00] that the the his the shedding of his
[54:02] blood was for for your benefit you
[54:05] realize the stripes played on his back
[54:06] was for your healing amen can you accept
[54:09] that yes
[54:11] because until you can accept that and
[54:13] make it personal to you it doesn't do
[54:15] you any good
[54:16] like i say when you get a check for a
[54:17] million dollars until you pay for it
[54:19] but all of a sudden you cash that that
[54:21] thing
[54:22] oh now
[54:37] it's including you and the family
[54:40] okay amen
[54:42] and for which cause he is not ashamed to
[54:44] call you brethren amen he is being
[54:46] related
[54:48] christ says you are related to him
[54:51] that's what this verse says
[54:53] you are related to god through jesus
[54:55] christ
[54:58] for as much then as the children were
[55:00] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[55:02] himself likewise took part of the same
[55:04] became our kinsmen that through death he
[55:06] might destroy him that had power of
[55:07] death
[55:08] so that he could take us as his children
[55:10] and redeem us back to god
[55:14] and he was going in hebrews 3 1 says
[55:16] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[55:17] heavenly calling
[55:19] particularly
[55:20] he says because the grace by which the
[55:23] saints are called is from heaven and it
[55:25] is to heaven that they are called amen
[55:28] we are called to live above this world
[55:31] we are called to live above the cares
[55:33] and and the problems and the things that
[55:35] we that we experience every single day
[55:38] we have to we have to begin to accept
[55:40] the fact that god is our father
[55:42] and god as our father loves us
[55:45] he loves you how do you know he loves
[55:46] you because for god so loved the world
[55:48] he gave his only begotten son whosoever
[55:50] believeth in him should not perish but
[55:51] have everlasting life god loves you he's
[55:54] demonstrated that love at the cross
[55:56] if he loved you enough to die for you
[55:58] even when you were in sin
[56:00] even when you you're against god even
[56:02] though you're amongst god even though
[56:03] you violated all the laws of god if he
[56:05] died for you at that point in time and
[56:07] he loves you enough to do that why won't
[56:09] you accept what he's trying to give you
[56:12] why won't you accept the fact that
[56:14] you're the pure virtuous sinless bride
[56:15] of jesus christ why won't you accept the
[56:18] fact that god has totally justified you
[56:19] because of the blood of jesus christ why
[56:22] won't you accept the fact that he has
[56:23] already healed you because of the
[56:24] striped plate on your back
[56:26] yes sir
[56:28] faith is not believing for something
[56:30] faith is believing in someone
[56:32] yes and if you can believe in the god
[56:34] that has called you if you can believe
[56:35] in the god that has redeemed you if you
[56:37] can believe that god loves you if you
[56:39] can believe that you are the pure
[56:40] virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ
[56:42] if you can accept these and grasp hold
[56:44] of these facts and you go to god and say
[56:46] well lord i have a need boy i'm your
[56:48] father what do you have in need of son
[56:51] amen what do you have a need of a
[56:52] daughter
[56:53] well satan's attacking me and i got this
[56:55] illness
[56:56] is
[57:05] thank you god for healing me amen thank
[57:07] you god what did abraham have to do
[57:08] thank you god for my son thank you god
[57:10] for my son he had to say that for 25
[57:11] years yeah thank you god for you know
[57:14] well okay so you have an illness okay
[57:18] what the bible say call for the elders
[57:19] of the church they'll lay hands on you
[57:22] prayer face will save the sick and you
[57:24] know amen
[57:30] so
[57:30] you either look at the symptoms you look
[57:32] at the promise amen and that's where the
[57:34] battle is yes yes your body says oh no
[57:36] you know you're not
[57:39] but he said i am yes yes
[57:41] [Music]
[57:44] it wasn't him believing for something it
[57:46] was him believing in someone
[57:49] well that's where we have to come
[57:53] we have to believe that god has the
[57:54] ability
[57:56] to take his promise he has given to us
[57:58] and bring it to pass amen it doesn't
[58:01] matter the circumstances
[58:03] right it merely matters
[58:04] matters our faith
[58:10] after this i looked and behold the door
[58:12] was open in heaven and the first voice
[58:14] which i heard was as away trumpet
[58:16] calling me and saying hey there
[58:18] and i will show you things that must be
[58:19] hereafter amen
[58:22] this is after the church ages
[58:26] ladies still going on around us
[58:29] but god's going to profit
[58:31] amen
[58:34] get away from your denominational
[58:36] teachings amen get away from the way
[58:38] that you perceive things
[58:39] come up higher come into a higher realm
[58:41] come into the realms of faith come into
[58:43] the realms of believing the word come
[58:45] into the realms of accepting who you are
[58:46] and what god said that you are amen rise
[58:49] above all of these things
[58:51] because only when you do that can god be
[58:53] given to you
[58:55] that's what i mean the whole message
[58:58] was to try and to take the word of god
[59:00] and make it real to the people why are
[59:03] all the miracles that god performed
[59:04] through brothers
[59:05] so we would have faith in the god that
[59:07] has called us
[59:09] he could i mean
[59:11] he would sit there and he would pray for
[59:13] thousands of people
[59:15] and god in his mercy and
[59:27] there's a couple of places he made
[59:29] mention he looked at a person and oh
[59:31] yeah i believe he says no you don't
[59:33] have a seat for a while
[59:35] and then he would preach the word
[59:37] and he would preach the word and you
[59:38] could see in that person always of the
[59:40] faith slowly begin to rise
[59:42] until finally what would happen all of a
[59:44] sudden the person accepted their healing
[59:46] not because brother brown prayed for
[59:48] them not because he laid hands on them
[59:49] no but because also their faith in god
[59:51] began to rise to the place they could
[59:53] accept what god said amen and once they
[59:56] got to the place they could accept it
[59:57] then they were healed amen
[1:00:06] you don't have to have the discernment
[1:00:08] he says all you have to do is have the
[1:00:09] faith to believe and if you have the
[1:00:11] faith to believe it's a finished word
[1:00:20] and the rising of the sun
[1:00:22] now who is the son of man
[1:00:24] in the beginning
[1:00:26] and and then it goes on and it says in
[1:00:28] the book book of luke
[1:00:30] as we just quoted in luke 17 and the
[1:00:32] 30th verse and malachi 4 and the
[1:00:35] different scriptures that we are
[1:00:36] acquainted with
[1:00:37] he says that that word again is waived
[1:00:40] over the people that the dead traditions
[1:00:43] of men is dead
[1:00:44] and the son of man is alive again
[1:00:47] with the baptism of the holy ghost right
[1:00:49] amongst us and living
[1:00:51] and living
[1:00:52] and giving us life amen
[1:00:59] oh yeah he had the gift of discernment
[1:01:01] he had the gift of the word of knowledge
[1:01:05] no
[1:01:07] he says i'm standing he said you know
[1:01:09] who i'm waiting for
[1:01:10] i'm waiting for him
[1:01:12] amen and sometimes he'll sit there and
[1:01:14] he'll just talk for ten minutes
[1:01:16] and also he's here now now i take every
[1:01:19] spirit under under my control for the
[1:01:21] glory of god yes
[1:01:22] he realized he was powerless until god
[1:01:26] but he realized when god came and then
[1:01:29] brother branham could yield himself to
[1:01:31] that angel to jesus christ
[1:01:34] he says he knew from that point on it
[1:01:36] was no longer him amen he yielded
[1:01:39] himself to the spirit
[1:01:40] okay right right
[1:01:43] because that was the son of man being
[1:01:44] made manifest
[1:01:46] brother branham was a son of man
[1:01:48] revealing the son of man
[1:01:52] but here again but god was using him
[1:01:54] okay so you said well that was great
[1:01:56] that was brother
[1:01:57] okay
[1:01:58] now relate that to you
[1:02:00] yes
[1:02:01] oh but i'm not a prophet not to ask him
[1:02:03] to be a prophet
[1:02:09] but what god is wanting to do he wants
[1:02:11] you to so yield your bodies to him
[1:02:14] so that he can work his life through you
[1:02:16] the same way he did through the prophet
[1:02:17] amen jesus christ i don't perform any
[1:02:20] miracles at all
[1:02:22] you steal the storm you walked on the
[1:02:24] water
[1:02:25] you raised the dead you did this you did
[1:02:27] that no i never did anything
[1:02:30] he does all these things
[1:02:33] what do you have
[1:02:36] when you accepted jesus christ as your
[1:02:37] savior you went through what are baptism
[1:02:40] claiming the name of jesus christ and
[1:02:41] god gave you the holy ghost
[1:02:44] what did you receive
[1:02:46] the third person of the trinity
[1:02:49] no you received god
[1:02:51] god himself now came and lived in you
[1:02:56] but you have to let him work with you
[1:02:58] do you realize you can stop god
[1:03:02] you have the ability to stop god
[1:03:06] because if god tells you to do something
[1:03:07] and you refuse just okay
[1:03:11] but if you'll obey
[1:03:13] then god will work through you
[1:03:17] so he goes on he says that
[1:03:19] that that word again is waved over the
[1:03:21] people
[1:03:22] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[1:03:24] and the son of god is a lot as the son
[1:03:26] of god is alive again with the baptisms
[1:03:28] among us and giving us life
[1:03:30] as christ was the first one to rise from
[1:03:33] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:03:35] although it typed in many places he was
[1:03:37] the first fruits of those that slept
[1:03:40] in the bride coming of christ
[1:03:42] coming out of the church there have to
[1:03:44] be that the a she's waved again in the
[1:03:46] last days
[1:03:48] oh my waving the sheep what was this
[1:03:49] she's the first one that came to
[1:03:51] maturity so it's talking about christ
[1:03:53] amen the first one that proved it was
[1:03:55] wheat that proved it
[1:03:57] that proved it was the sheep
[1:03:59] he said and for the first time there
[1:04:01] will come forth for the bright age for a
[1:04:04] resurrection out of dark denominational
[1:04:06] there will be a message that the full
[1:04:08] maturity of the word has turned back
[1:04:10] again and being waved over the people by
[1:04:12] the same signs and wonders that he did
[1:04:14] back there
[1:04:15] praise the lord that was the ministry
[1:04:17] that god performed through the prophet
[1:04:19] yes
[1:04:20] the prophet was not jesus christ
[1:04:22] the prophet was not god the prophet was
[1:04:25] a man the prophet was a sinner saved by
[1:04:27] grace
[1:04:37] he said god above us in the father god
[1:04:39] in us in the sun
[1:04:40] cleansing his way
[1:04:42] condescending coming down making way for
[1:04:44] me to get back and bring his people back
[1:04:47] to the manifestation manifested sons of
[1:04:49] god like
[1:04:51] like they had them in the garden of eden
[1:04:53] the whole world is
[1:04:54] is
[1:04:55] groaning and waiting for the hour for
[1:04:57] that manifestation
[1:05:02] and things that are to be we must live
[1:05:04] the word because the bride is part of
[1:05:06] the
[1:05:07] like any wife is part of her husband
[1:05:09] therefore we must be that word bride and
[1:05:12] what is that word bride the
[1:05:13] manifestation of this hour
[1:05:16] the bride not a creed or a denomination
[1:05:18] but a living oracle of god a living
[1:05:21] attribute of god displaying to the world
[1:05:23] the attributes of god in the form of the
[1:05:25] bride that is to be expressed in the
[1:05:26] hour that we're now living amen
[1:05:29] jesus christ no matter if he was in a
[1:05:31] storm and the gales knocking the boat
[1:05:33] from one side to the other he was
[1:05:34] standing in the face of a mess of demons
[1:05:36] if he was hanging around and never moved
[1:05:38] him he walked right along just as calm
[1:05:40] and quite as he could be saying why
[1:05:43] because he was simply unconscious of
[1:05:45] fear of anything around him that's right
[1:05:47] whether it was going to happen or
[1:05:48] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[1:05:49] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:05:50] god had said so i wonder
[1:05:53] okay okay move up to now a supreme faith
[1:05:57] where we take god out of his word and no
[1:05:59] longer question amen because that is
[1:06:01] what supreme faith is yes god made a
[1:06:04] promise well god you made the promise
[1:06:07] so therefore you're obligated to your
[1:06:09] promise
[1:06:10] okay i just wait i expect it to come

[1:06:29] that regardless of what happens in your
[1:06:31] life not in control and god is leading
