mind maybe you'll take them yeah but you know she died safe praise two years after a stroke she died and i shouldn't say she died she crossed over but there was a reason in it she's safe she's waiting for me she seemed my i just want to say thank you you know i'm really grateful for the lord you know he brought us from a vacation to sedona and uh we were running low on a battery on the dodge charger and uh thank god you know we made it to tucson we broke down at uh was it uh two minutes away from our house off a mission oh wow i'm very grateful and you know thankful for the lord you know he made us far off you know and just real thankful we got it fixed amen praise the lord amen amen that's good anyone else this is quick testimony it may seem significant to other people but i have to take care of all this stuff including charging my battery the night before services and last night i was laying down drifting off and then like something hit me and i woke up and i was like oh my gosh i didn't charge the battery so i thank god for waking me up any other testimonies amen all right well we'll keep going here um sing a song i think most of us are familiar with the days of elijah [Music] these are the days of elijah of the lord [Music] in the [Music] like the sun [Music] is these are the things and these [Music] and these are the days [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] there's [Music] is [Music] like [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] i think a lot of us are familiar with the uh chorus but i'm gonna try to sing the verses uh before brother benny comes up here we've got the power of the name of jesus [Music] for whatever [Music] amen yes we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got the power in the name of the lord [Music] in the name of the lord for many [Music] every battle [Music] is [Music] those things [Music] is [Music] we've got the power in the name of the lord [Music] in the name of jesus we've got the power [Music] [Applause] amen i know many times in life probably we feel like we're defeated but you cannot be defeated in the name of jesus amen amen by yourself you're no match to the enemy but when you come in the name of jesus all uh enemies have to fall out your feet yes amen because we cannot be defeated in the name of jesus praise the lord and i believe we come here today carrying that name brandishing the name of jesus didn't come for any other reason any other purpose we didn't come for the right reason but i believe every one of you here today we come in the name of jesus to worship and to glorify magnify his holy name amen amen praise the lord you know when you sing those songs you got to believe them well that'll be in your heart it's got to be something that's established in your soul i'm seeing this because i believe it i'm singing this by conviction i'm singing this because i love the lord i'm seeing this because i believe that what it says is true in my life amen i am victorious in the name of jesus praise the lord jesus amen i'm so thankful today that he is always on our side he never leaves us or forsakes us and he blesses us continues to strengthen us amen god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord um social distancing is taking a nap amen amen uh we're like paul i i've told y'all i'll tell you again uh my attitude about it uh you know when i'm out in the world and i'm out in life i i'm i'm wisdom i use precaution um i don't always wear a mask but i do where they mandate mandated a lot of people get confused between what is a law and what is a mandate some people come up and say well it's a law you have to no it's not a law it's a mandate i mean the legislature makes laws the executive branch like the governor mayor they can only mandate something that they say you need to or should do this and people say well the bible says obey the law well this is not a law it's a mandate a law is passed by the legislature not by executive not by governor not by mayor not by city council it's by the legislature when they pass a law it's different but anyway i i take my precaution but you know my feeling we come in these doors here friend we're here in the service of the lord amen we're here in the name of the lord we're here for the service of the lord and we're here because god brought us here and i believe and you know some wear masks and shields and that's perfectly fine i don't have any qualms with that uh that that's perfectly fine right but again i don't want it to become a situation to where we become divided by masking no masked people right we are all the people and children of god amen amen i believe in the bible that when when paul was in the service of the lord and he got struck by a poisonous viper he just shook it off in the fire and kept going and those that he was preaching to who thought he was a devil beginning to believe he was a god amen so things can change very quick when you're in the presence of the lord amen amen praise the lord so and i want you to know when i pray for you uh that that i pray a shield of protection around every one of you amen praise god god's protection his holy angels keep you and protect you and watch over you amen so god is god is with us amen and i believe that exactly amen i speak to the streaming i don't know how many streaming everybody's here so amen i missed the pats and um the zinkas i thought brother thomas sister karen might be here but you know brother tom had his soldier the shoulder surgery so he's still recuperating with that so continue to please pray for brother tom in that situation too uh but we're very thankful that god is ever present he's always with us his blessings and love he never subsides amen so we appreciate each one of you coming being here today if you haven't been here uh the bathroom's through the door to the right and please and for those who may be listening or watch don't park on the north side of the building also pray for the situation with the building um brother uh we're not sure brother nat seems to have been a little distant with brother roger myself lately but we're just trusting the lord taking care of it but you know if we're growing out of this building already maybe it's time to go someplace else so just pray about that whatever the lord's will is um i believe uh that the lord provided this and we moved in under that premise i wouldn't be here if i didn't feel it was the will of the lord amen i told brother roger out there i said well if the lord shut one door he'll open the others that's right i'm not i'm not i'm not worried about it god will provide so thankful for that so god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord if you would turn with me in your bibles if you'd stand today stand one more time please for the honor of the reading of the word but we're going to go to the book of exodus and it it seems like that it seems like that the lord just keeping me in the old testament for some reason but that's quite all right amen the old testament provides plenty of types and shadows for us to follow and recognize and see what he's doing for us even in today's life amen it's amazing how god being infinite eternal uh from 6 000 years ago can kind of give us types and shadows of what's going on right now right amen is everybody comfortable by the way are you warm or a little bit amen we had it set on 73 and it was only 69 so i thought maybe you're okay but if you get a little warm i just make sure everybody's comfortable mike can uh adjust the adjust the temperature there so we're we're here in faith amen faith believe me praise the lord amen amen exodus chapter 11. let's just bow our heads again forward to prayer before we approach the word of god father god we thank you so much lord for your blessings and your love to us thank you lord for the song service and for the ability to raise our voices and worship and praise to you god it's deep in our hearts lord that sometimes the world seems to crowd out god and seems to dumb down but lord we come into here lord to let it loose and to and to let our hearts come before you lord in the praises of our lips and worshiping you today and glorifying and magnifying your lord you've been so good to us lord we thank you so much for your ever presence in our lives and for helping us and watching over blessing us every day thank you lord for these that have come today may your holy spirit move in a powerful mighty supernatural way god is you would come and not in word form only but in power and manifestation of your spirit god made that holy anointing lord from this place lord infiltrate and filter out to those who may be streaming today god those who may watch it afterwards may your holy spirit fall on them afresh as well lord may there not be a sick person may there not be a feeble person may there not be a person in need lord or in a derision leave this place today without a touch from you so god we believe that you are here we welcome and invite your presence and we rebuke every demonic spirit of hell that would try to come against hindu or hurt this service in any way satan you have no place here in the name of jesus christ god to you be all the glory honor and praise as we approach your word now may you bless it as we commit it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ for your glory and honor amen let's let's read here excuse me uh exodus chapter 11. let's begin with verse 4. exodus chapter 11 verse 4. i'm going to take a thought that i kind of uh hinted on last week and spent a couple of minutes on i want to take a whole subject here um i honestly wasn't really sure what the lord had and all week pretty much every day i'm like the lord uh you know as a pastor as a minister you you want to make sure first of all you got the mind of the lord and second of all there's something that's needful for the people uh that are there for that time and uh and then actually yesterday the lord brought me to this place and so um we'll just go on uh exodus 11 4 and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the meal and all the firstborn of the beast and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there not was not like it nor shall be like it anymore but against any of the children listen now but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know that the lord put a difference between the egyptians and israel and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he will and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt and moses and aaron did all the things all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go out of his land and you could be seated if you'd like i'm sure you can probably get the gist of the subject today based on my enunciation of that portion of the scripture when we got to the seventh and eighth verse is kind of outstanding and follows along with what we had talked about last week for a few moments but i want to title this today blessed during crisis blessed during crisis or could be blessed during curses were blessed during the curse amen we mentioned it again like i said last week when we talked about uh being in this situation and being in this land and being a part of lao to see it and being in this country and the things that's going on around us and all the turmoil and the things that's happening but help us to understand to have faith now last week we talked about rest and of course resting in that faith resting in that understanding resting in that knowledge that you know who you are in jesus christ brother branham said as we read that quote it's not that we're worried about going we know we've already made it we've already made it because he made it for us and we're on his side so if we're with the lord and he's already made it then we've made it with him he's made it for us thus we're we are more than conquerors because we didn't have to go through the battle or fight but we're there with him amen so we can rest in that fact and resting in that fact helped us to understand that not only are we resting in that but as this first wave of covet came through and i said this several times in our church services several times that god blessed us i mean we mother me and brother roger have been busy crazy working and been very prosperous and had a lot of work to do and we often talk about amongst ourselves uh every day we think you know how how all this has gone on and how the uh people are suffering and people in food lines longer than they've been and and people out of jobs and out of work and people are going in great debt and things like that because you know they're they're struggling real hard and i'm sitting here and i'm thinking about and i'm thinking about all of you and i'm thinking about how god has blessed us so much during this period of time where people are suffering so much when people are in so much want and need and then my mind started going back to think about the bible and and all the situations where god has protected and not only protected not only kept his people but blessed his people amen blessed abundantly his own people and that's what we look to as god is doing what he's doing around us and we know we're at the end we know that the time has come to an end we know that there's not much time left in this world we know that we're at the world's ending stages and we know that the bride goes out in a rapture before we actually get to that end stage right so we know we're at that season we know we're at that time so we've read the back of the book and we know what happens i told my barber thursday they were talking about all this stuff and you know and and of course i have to tell them about scripture and he's a catholic and i tell them about description the bible and you know tell them my point of view and they're like well i'm not so sure about that and this that and the other and i said well i've read the back of the book and the bible says this this and this oh really it does didn't know that i said when you go home today at least read revelation 13 and it'll tell you a little bit about what's going on right now amen and while this garnering together and sister julie sent me a uh that uh article i had told you all about a little bit last week this uh this cardinal this archbishop i believe it was that actually called out the pope and and the things that's going on and that letter he wrote four or five months ago and some of those things i read in that letter actually are happening right now that he said and told in that letter what happened they're actually happening now and it wasn't something that he considers himself a prophet or prophetic or those were prophetic utterances those were just things of knowledge he had gained of what he knows is going on around the world and in his own church and with his own pope the things is happening there but in the midst of all that in the midst of the squeeze in the midst of the clamping down and we see the clamping friend amen we see the clamping down you you can see it around the world you see the control that that the the people that the government that the that those that are in power and those that have money and those that are in position around the world clamping down on people and on religion and mostly on christians right if you haven't noticed it friend we're just not looking but it's clamping they're clamping down on christian religion but when and we know brother branham said they'll they'll close these doors one day that's right and you know the doors of the branham tabernacle are basically closed you know they don't have service at brown tabernacle anymore that's right of course that i guess is because they got so many people but you never thought that when brother branham said that door would be closed one day that it'd be closed by his own people but the doors closed they don't have church there anymore but we know what's going on we know what's happening we know and this is just preparing our hearts and understanding where we're at today and applying it scripturally so when i began to think about the the several different and and if you've read your bible and you know the scripture you know the things i'm talking about uh i'm not giving you anything new i'm just bringing your remembrance and trying to encourage you today that if we as the children of god get caught up in the world of the worldliness and all the things that's going on there you're going to end up being defeated but if you stand upon the word of god and you pray and you read your bible and you stand on the promises of god's word as a child of god filled with the holy ghost god is going to bless you you're going to be blessed and prosperous in the middle of all this that's right and that first wave i thought and many days and i mentioned it in church many times friend we were we were helped we were blessed i can't think of and you're and feel free to raise your hand now in all fairness we have you know a third of our church or so that's retired so um they didn't stop the social security checks from coming in for for those but you can raise your hand if i'm wrong but i don't know of anybody that lost their job during that time even sister shelia who has a job that's really very much hands-on they figured out a way for her to do her job remotely right so she could keep doing what she was doing god blesses his people in the middle of crisis and god blesses his people in the middle of curses even when uh sister norman your sister passed away but listen as her sister passed away at the great testimony that she has on her sister's passing friend to understand that she went into the arms of jesus what greater thing could you imagine for your siblings what kind of thing could you imagine for your parent or for your child or for anybody that you love that they're now in the arms of the lord praise the lord that's what matters the most we just need to make sure our lives are in his hands too and that we're in the position that we're supposed to be in because as god began to uh lower the curses on israel on egypt he made sure and told moses and moses told pharaoh that israel would be exempt from these curse amen he did amen amen now what was the curse the curse was that the firstborn of egypt no matter how old that firstborn was no matter whether that firstborn was a human or an animal every firstborn to the animals would be healed that's right we know that the death age will come and sweep through the land oh man what did we talk about last week israel was a part of egypt israel was in egypt i should say i mean part of egypt but they were in egypt so if israel was in egypt they were in the middle of the curse they were in the middle of the crisis but what did god tell them god spoke to moses spoke through moses or aaron his mouthpiece and spoke to the pharaoh and said the firstborn of egypt and all the beasts shall die and there'll be such a greater crime throughout the egypt that has never been before and never will be since but the seventh verse says but amen i love that that butt makes an exemption yeah that exemption says but against any of the children of israel shall i say today but any of the children of god today amen any of the children of god right now any of you here this morning are on streaming shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord that put a difference between egypt and israel amen or god has put a difference between the world and his children amen amen amen friend we are in this world but we're not of this world and god has placed a stark difference between the world and between his children that's why you look at it and the difference gets greater all the time the difference is more visible all the time even it used to be when i was growing up a man in the message was almost like any other man you couldn't tell them and somewhat still that way the sisters always been the one that god has put now go with me here god has put on display right the christian woman as the greatest example of the separation that god has drawn between the world and his people amen amen but even now now it's getting to the place that the the man is so different yes right it's almost like even the man now because you know you you live your life you live your life as a christian you say clean living and and all you do what the bible says and obedience to the word and you live your life but even the man now the world has gotten so wicked that even the christian man's life is drawing a difference people are seeing the difference in the christian man now not as much as the sisters now of course because you'll always be the one that god set forth right amen amen because remember you're the you're the one that god endowed to bring life into this world right right i said that two or three times and i don't know how to make that anymore i mean that's how much god loves and thinks of his children and how much god loves and thinks of the godly sister see but god said that as an example and he set it aside and a part that you would understand and that you could see the difference it's not just something that's just spiritual although that's the greater difference but it's a spiritual thing that manifests itself in a physical manifestation so people can look at it as a tangible item that you are different than the world right you're called out and god wants to make you let you know today just like he did israel that he has drawn a line between the difference of the world and his children amen between the world and what's going on on out there and what he has done for you and for his children around the world there's that difference and it's a stark difference because some people are able to hold it together some people are suffering some people don't have a job you know that they have this uh protection for not being evicted out of your home right right but you know that people say well you don't have to pay the rent because they're not going to evict you that might be true you don't have to pay your mortgage because you're not going to get evicted that might be true you might have to pay your power bill because your power is not going to be turned off that might be true you don't have to pay your water because your water is not going to get up that might be true but what they're doing is accruing all those monthly bills that's right right and all these people out here when that time hits about the time excuse me that about the time that joe biden is supposed to take off us about that same time is when all this stuff's going to go away yeah and people are going to be tens of thousands of dollars in debt right right they've been months and months and months without having to pay the rent well if they can't pay up let's just say a thousand dollars this month then it's 2 000 in the next month right they can't pay that is 3 000 the next month it's four yeah you're not getting evicted but at the end of this you're going to owe 10 grand to the people that are your landlords and not only that but you're gonna have a thousand dollar a power bill you're gonna have a 500 water bill what are these people going to do but god has not only sustained you hear me now and you correct me if i'm wrong god has not only sustained you but god has blessed you amen god has blessed us god has blessed her sister julie had just gotten a brand new job and you think man if there's anybody during this time of shutdown that's right for the firing it would be someone just hired him right oh no no they didn't fire they just let her work from home praise the lord just work for home it's okay still has her job god blesses his children in the middle of crisis god takes care of his children but now i want you to see something and see something very clearly because it's god's children that we're separating not not make believers and unbelievers but the division is made between the believer the believer and the unbelievers those that are there that are pretending to be that's a whole different scenario i'm talking about the true believer i'm talking about the board again holy ghost field children of god amen because notice when the children of israel were not going to read it but when the children of israel was given this promise and egypt was told that the firstborn of everyone was going to die but god made an exemption for the children of israel they had to obey god's word or they were a part of the curse amen right yes god said the children of israel are exempt absolutely i agree with that but look at the condition that god gave moses to give to the children of israel that exempted them amen they had to be under the blood to be protected from this death angel amen amen amen they had to be under the blood they had to be we'll say in today's terms born again they had to have the holy ghost they had to be filled with god's spirit they had to be under the blood right you had to be under the blood today you can't just come out and say oh well i i believe it's all okay and i'm going to be fine and everything's great don't work that way you must get under the blood amen that's the only way it worked for them today then it's the only way it'll work today amen is to have your life and every bit about you under that blood under the protection of that token the holy spirit amen that's the only way you're exempt from it amen that's the only way you get blessed now israel because they were under it god judged them as a nation as a people they were many members but one god considered them as one group but now the gentile is a many men for body that god deals with individually so this is an individual affair she said well my daddy's under don't protect you oh my mommy's under don't protect you oh my pastor's under doesn't protect you ate my children under doesn't protect you what protects you is when you are under the blood when you have the holy ghost you're born again and you are in christ and christ is in you amen that's your protection that's your blessing remember god only blessed israel when they were in their homeland god only blesses his children today when we're in our homeland what is our homeland the holy ghost amen when we're in christ the word we have that exemption thank you and not only are we kept from the crisis we are blessed in the middle of it thank you amen amen you know that you're blessed today amen amen you know that god has blessed you not and i mean i know i'm talking a lot monetarily but it's not just monetary blessings god has blessed us physically god has blessed us spiritually god reveals his word to us god has given us health and strength and our families and we've been blessed amen because god blesses us in that hallelujah and we trust him every amendment he does we trust him for that amen we're not subjects of this world we're not subjects of this cosmos or subjects of god amen you go home and read revelation 13 as i told my barber the other day you go home and read revelation 13 you'll see what's about to strike what is striking not about to what is striking right what's going on in this world when this country right now is happening right now and that mark of the beast is here friend that's right it was here 50 years ago when brother adam said it was here yes if it was here 50 years ago it's here now yeah man it's the same thing and people make the same mistake all the time they think their fellowship with the church or their their name on a book or their their their fellowship card is going to get them into into heaven doesn't work that way that's right you have to have your own experience with jesus christ amen i'm not putting those churches out maybe they know god maybe the pastor is born again i don't know but i know that the mark of the beast lies in the nomination because that's what the prophet of god said amen so if he said it i believe it amen you take that dogma you take that fellowship what does it do it gets on you as dogma right that's when the separation comes but do you see how that's coming now because all those denominations going back to mom are right anyways yes right the mother church and they all go back to the mother church and and then the pope steps forward and takes over we see where this is getting to be to the place that they're all joined together that they all end up giving power to that image of the beast amen and the mark of the beast is set in well unless you have this and this and this you're not a part of us right if you're not a part of them then you can't buy or sell now we're getting into tribulation of course i don't plan to be here that time right now that's what's going on this is going to transition from now to that place from now to that point if you're here during the tribulation then you can understand what i'm talking about and you'll see it happen live amen but my prayer is that none of you are right it is god amen my prayer is that none of you are that's my prayer but we're not subjects of this cosmos amen we're not subjects of this world we're subject to god we're here as pilgrims and strangers we're here uh in this laodicea and just just sojourners in this world that's right we're just sojourning away as god gives us the the leadership and as god helps us to do his will upon this earth and maybe there is another seed out there that god wants to bring us to maybe there's somebody out there god wants us to witness to somebody there that god wants us to help we do that by the leading of the lord god leads us and that's where we go with every day that god gives us because we'll have a time because we're not promised tomorrow right so if we're not promised tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow holds we all got plans for tomorrow i imagine most of us do anyway well well we're going to do this this and this i mean we all got plans but we're not promised tomorrow may not even be here so what god wants us to do we do now we do with the time that god give us and god give us now that's why you're here this morning that's why we're doing the best we can with what god's given us that we're here gathered together with the word of god to let god minister to us and reveal his word to us so we become closer more like him i don't want to be more like mutant bennett i want to be more like jesus i don't want to be more like you i want to be more like him i don't want to be more like brother branham i want to be more like jesus that's my goal that's what i'm shooting for i'm shooting to be to emulate the life of jesus we're in this world we're in this layout to see a spirit you know this layout to see a spirit of course the bible talks about in revelation 3 it talks about it being lukewarm and it's very lukewarm you see the lukewarmness spreading and god help us if it leaks in has been leaking into the message through lukewarmness brother dennis prayed about it lord let's not be lukewarm that's that layout to see in spirit that's right now you're in the world and we're blessed in the middle of this crisis but as you're as you're blessing this crisis your body is a time element body that is still subject to the things of the world that's right amen if you don't think so uh after church take the hammer that's in here and whack your finger with it you'll find out real quick that your body is still subject to the elements of this world yes don't do that please but seriously you you'll understand real quick our bodies are still a subject so if our bodies are subject to the elements of the world in our spirits right our spirits are subject to the elements of the world so we fight against the principalities and powers since uh uh uh dark places and and and of the spirit realm sometimes spirits so if if our spirit is still subject to the spirits that's in the world today then the spirit of laodicea can creep in on your spirit that's right and in your spirit make you start becoming lackadaisical and lazy and lukewarm and meaning of course uh it also the word laodicea in other words jesus typed it as lukewarmness it actually means people's rights or your rights and friend if we've never seen before in this world people are asking for rights look don't get me wrong i have my own opinion and thoughts of things so i'll just say it this way there are people in this country right now screening for rights they already have that's correct so what is it that they're wanting what is it that they're fighting what is it that they're striving for when they've got the rights they're screaming about to fund the police and so on and so forth yeah they got the rights they're screaming about so what do they want they don't want anything they are living an unbridled unfiltered desire and lust for something they'll never have amen and they keep craving for it in this place in this place over here and over there and but yet they're lost and their their their desire is to attain to something that monetarily physically they already have amen but there's that drive and that craving and that yearning to get to something that they'll never have amen so they just keep they just keep on and keep on and keep on and keep pressing keep pushing keep striving because they're just going to keep on going until until there's nothing left to go on about because they're under the influence of laodicea right they're under the influence of people's rights they're under the influence of my rights i i have a right to my rights and if you think on it long enough and you think of it logically that makes perfect sense does it not man logically it makes perfect sense i have rights of my own but as a christian we have relinquished our rights that's right we are lambs of god and we have relinquished our rights to his will amen and we don't have rights our rights are his rights amen and what god does for us is all that matters that's right we're in this world and subject to the world is subject to the powers that are as much as i dislike that in some cases we are subject to the powers that exist correct right if we're subject to the powers that exist we give the benevolence to that that is due scripturally but outside of that friend my allegiance is to god amen amen my purpose and will is to the lord jesus and my rights have been relinquished to him amen so when you get into the middle of that nail to see him and if that laodicea presses in on you my rights is it's my rights that then you're going to be in that same argument you're going to be in the middle of that same fuss right arguing and fighting over something that already exists amen amen amen people sometimes people seem to fight and struggle and and go every which way to try to get something that god has already given them let's just say healing for an example yes amen amen healing sometimes seems unattainable right and sometimes we get very impatient but the thing that we strive and we fight and we we we struggle for god's already given it to you praise god healing is already there god has already purchased it it is yours thank you jesus it's a matter of faith and stepping into it and believing that god has already finished it amen that's just an example but notice now in the church age book in the laodicean church age i'm going to use this to transition to the next part i want to get to notice the name laodicea the people's rights or justice of the peoples that's that's the meaning of laodicea it's luke it's spirit is lukewarmness yes it's definition is the people's rights or the justice of the peoples was there never an age like the 20th century church or i'll just say 21st century as we have transitioned into now 21st century church age that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially what does that sound like sounds like the crowd that's going on and getting louder in this country socialism which is nothing but a socialism is communist junior that's all socialism yeah socialism is communist junior because they're the same thing basically there's a couple of small little based what i consider insignificant differences but it's really communism is what it is but that's exactly the the sound that's going on today demanding equality socially financially this is the age of the communists where all men are supposedly equal though it is not but it is only so in theory it is only so when they're out on the stump and they're telling the people oh you have rights and we're all supposed to be on the same plane equal level doesn't work that way right never have right and anytime they try the country to do that it doesn't work and the people are the ones that suffer from it oh the the ones that are crying and screaming about it oh they do fine jose got millions of dollars they're in powers of positions of power they do just fine what they do is they boss around and tell everybody else what to do and suppress you down oh you're all equal yeah but you're all equal in poverty right well they're up in all their power and all their money right oh yeah equality all right equality in the fact that they are the ones that own all the power and money it only works communism socialism only works in a in a society where the people are subject completely to the government to the powers that be and to those that are in charge have the money remember what i told you last week it sounds great when they say oh we're going to pay all your bills we're going to pay off all your debt we're going to give you all this money every month we're going to give you uh there's already been people out in congress say we ought to pay everybody truth out everybody in the united states citizen and legally illegal aliens you get two thousand dollars a month yeah and free healthcare well my question is where's all that money coming from yeah just crank up the 3d or or the laser printer whatever you know just keep rolling them out you know until we get so far in debt which we already now you can't get out you can't get out of debt then where do you are you subject to those that you're in debt too yes yeah amen in steps to pope he's got the authority he's got the the the backing he's got the uh uh the the stature and almost every if not every single socioeconomic group in the world likes him amen from muslims to jews and all across the board yeah and you heard what he said about homosexual unions the other day that's right this is the age of political parties who call themselves christian democrats and christian socialists christian commonwealth federation etc according to our liberal theologians jesus was a socialist and the early church under the guidance of the spirit practiced socialism and thus we ought to do so today when the ancients called laodicea the metropolis it was looking forward it was looking forward to the one world government that we are now setting up amen which is very much highlighted in the article i tell you sister julie sent me that i have read four or five times now through setting up and we know it was at that certain place a certain time you say well you know if it was coming to at that time why didn't it just happen wait you know that there's scriptural precedence for things evolving and and happening and god says no whole wait hold it back stop we're going to wait till this happens right revelation 7 comes to my mind you look at revelation 7 and the angels have the four corners of the earth and are about to destroy the earth and god says hold him back yeah right don't destroy it we got to mark those that have the holy ghost the sign cry of the abomination see we got to mark those god said hold it stop it wait so if it's not happened then there must have been a reason for it amen but as it comes forward and you see all of these scriptures all of the prophecies unfolding before you friend how could we mistake what's going on right now amen how the scripture and the message is unfolding itself for us to identify ourselves in it to see what's going on and that's exactly what's happening they say jesus was a socialist well you know when the when the the disciples got the holy ghost and told everybody to sell everything and put it all in a pot and give to whatever need they needed but that's where people that were born again amen if you got people that's born again and filled with the holy ghost it'll work right right but you get a serpent seed in the middle of that mess and you got a mess that's right and we don't have just a serpent seed we've got millions billions of serpent seed that we've got to deal with around so you think it's going to work there with the serpent see in the middle of that right serpency greed uh arrogance and all that comes with the serpents you think that's going to work right it doesn't work under capitalism you think it's going to work under socialism that's right brother brother brown said the best form of government was a monarchy with the king that had the heart of the people right amen amen that's right that's right because he is that key that's right when his economy works perfect amen it just won't happen in this world why because you still have satan's eating you still have serpent seed in the midst of all that that's right you got serpent seed involved in it friend it doesn't work right not gonna work amen all this one world government that they're setting up now as we and and just perfect for the pope to come in right it's all going to be that one great thing he's going to come in and say i'll take it over i'll buy it out and and the people that had that he has garnered their favor they're going to throw their lot to him amen and they're probably i'm just guessing they're going to say if there's any man that can do this it's him right if there's anybody that can take this over and make it work it's him right so much so that the vatican is even going to make that covenant with the jews that's right now remember though i can't remember if i got that i did i printed that quote it's going to be after the bride leaves though right amen i'll read you that quote in a minute but that's going to be after the bride leaves but it'll be so much so that the vatican will even make a covenant with the jews with israel of course you'll break it but amen that that's that's i'm trying to make the point of how the favoritism that he's garnering from all the people amen amen and he's taking it over it's uh we're at this place friend as we think this city being a location of great council foreshadow the ecumenical move taking place today we're in very very soon we'll see all the so-called christians come together those denominations and those that are the the harlots indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together the tares are being bound the wheat will soon be ready for the garner that's right that's us the wheat ready for the garden now let's go over there's several places in the scripture that you can find and see but the nation that come to my heart when i was studying through this is first kings chapter 17. it's about elijah and it's about elijah's progress from the time that he goes before ahab and declares no rain or dew until the time of mount carmel showdown and just after and that little synopsis of elijah's life tells us a lot about what happened to him and what's going on i think what i believe what's going on right now right today first kings chapter 17 let's just read verse one first t first kings 17 1 and elijah the tishbite who is of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word notice elijah said according to my word well where was his word coming from what was his word being influenced by right god so as he's saying my word what he's saying is god's word because god's speaking through me but he identified the fact that he was in god god was in him right right they were the communion fellowship together that was that was standing before ahab to say i'm going to be the one to speak it god is going to use this instrument and there's many places in the bible we've referenced it maybe we'll take a whole study on it sometimes but we've referenced where god says in the bible the bible says i will but himself he didn't go right he always he sends a representative amen he said somebody down from his dead in his place to be there on his behalf right now that helps us today to understand that god didn't just do that then he does it now and that we are sitting here we are here today on behalf of the lord jesus as his mouthpiece amen as his word as he's speaking and speaking to us and us speaking through uh us speaking to whatever he gives us to speak whoever he gives us we could do whatever it might be it's god amen working through his instruments working through his children elijah here he said there'll be no rain no do fall these years until i call for it until i say so but look now who was an inhabitant of the land that he just cursed he is right he is an inhabiter of the land he just cursed amen so he is a part of the curse when he said no reign or do he's a part of that right not only would everybody else not get any rain or do he wouldn't get any rain or do right but we all know what god did for life then in the spirit of god god led him and god led him down to a place that the third verse says get thee hence and turn the eastward to hide thyself by the brook cherry that is before jordan god sent ravens to feed him right right god sent the birds to feed him that's how much god wants is going to take care of his children if he has to call an animal or the or the animal life to come and sustain you to bless you in the middle of this crisis god will do it whatever he has to do of course the brook was still flowing had water in it but yet god called the raven to come and bring him food right praise the lord and she go down to the desert museum and get a ram to do that or call the javelina hallelujah no god did it all right there's the difference god is in control of every body line animal life human life and if we lose perspective of that friend then we've lost everything right because god that means that god's in control of you right so god was calling these ravens to come feed him but i want you to pay your attention to because in this curse in this crisis god is doing a miracle for elijah now he doesn't know it elijah doesn't understand it right because i mean trust me i'd rather go to golden corral than have a crow bring me my food i'd rather go to longhorn than have a then have a buzzer drop me drop me a mercel or two every once in a while so don't get me wrong he may not have known it but god has got elijah in a position that he's getting ready to do a tremendous miracle through him amen but for this miracle to happen you remember brother abraham talked about there's uh uh diseases and spirits that are harder than others right that that uh uh you know you say well this this might take a a spark of faith but you know this is going to take this doesn't just happen because you say you got faith right i mean this like epilepsy he said epilepsy was a hard spirit to get rid of to cast off see so god is getting ready in this great miracle god's getting ready to do for elijah he's got to prepare him for it he's got to get him in condition and that and look i think that's exactly what god's doing with the bride today i believe that's why god has his bride now you got to remember and i don't mean this derogatorily and i'm not putting anybody out or putting anybody in but there's people out there that say they're in the message and they're not in christ they say they're a believer in this message they follow brother branham but they have no relationship with jesus christ they're not a believer in the sense that they're a believer in their in their relationship with christ amen and if that is not there i don't care how many books you've read or how much quote you can quote if you're not there with jesus you're not there at all and that's what matters amen it's your relationship not with a message book but with christ amen amen so i believe that god is doing the exact same thing today now what is god doing for us here and bringing that bride together now this bride is not gathered in tucson it's not gathered in north carolina or wisconsin it's not gathered in china or russia or uh singapore it's international america this bride is around the world so what is god gathering her under he's got to be gathering her under the one auspice of jesus christ the word amen the shed blood of the innocent lamb like it was in egypt that delivered the people is the same thing that's going to cause this bride to leave this world one day in a rapture and god is bringing her together and conditioning her to get her ready and prepared for the time that the faith is needed for a body change a body change amen amen i think the culmination of that will be when we start seeing our loved ones appear before you when my mom and dad and my son show up when they're sitting on the front pew or they show up at the breakfast table or at my job one day there she is right hallelujah amen i'm not gonna have to conjure it up you're not gonna have to make it it'll be there and that's the culmination right if you're not there ready for that time you won't get it that's right amen amen if you're not ready for that time that unity of faith then you won't get it but if the preparation which to me is being done right now amen the bride in faith coming together under the auspice of christ the word and now when i say christ the word i mean the reveal word of the hour too of course the message i'm not trying to put that out when we're all coming together in that light in that condition god's preparing her for some great miracle that's about to take place amen praise god when the dead in christ rise we begin to sin we're here a minimum of 30 days and we do body change we're gone that's right praise god that's it and friend we know in type that there was a seven day period where in uh where uh noah went on the ark and there was no rain but no one else could be saved amen no one else could come in bang on the door no let us in we want to see around what kind of animals you got in there can't let you in god shut the door rain starts the judgment is beginning to hit in earnest yes noah let us in this is your aunt uncle sorry god shut the door yes i can't open it amen there's no lights there's no string god closed the door amen i did what god said do he prepared me we made preparation we built the ark and we came in when god said so he sent the animals in for us yeah that's right and then he shut the door when it was over god shut the door you say it was over yes amen it was over well there's still people out there yes but it was still over right there's people gonna be out there today but it's going to be over amen should it be people coming to the altar thinking they're getting saved when it's over hallelujah it'll be over because there's a period of time that we will still be here the bride will still be here for a period of time where no one else will be able to come in right amen now when is that time i don't know real man never said personally i believe it's going to be the time between the dead of christ rise and we see our loved ones appear and the time she goes home yes that's my opinion i i could be completely wrong you might have another opinion that's just fine uh i won't differ with you don't differ with me we'll love one another and it'll be okay that's my opinion that's right but i do know one thing it does exist and there will be a time it will be that period of time but what god's doing is preparing he was preparing elijah let's go back to this word uh cherith again look at god when he sends elijah down to the brook cherith right if you look at that word cherith the the meaning of the word cherith is cutting apparently there was still things in elijah's life that god had to get rid of that god had to purge him from that god had to do some cutting on elijah now maybe some of that cutting had to be the ravens coming the rain not coming being out by the brook we don't know the bible doesn't say but the brook cherith means cutting so what god is doing is cutting away anything that god that shouldn't be in moses life anything that moses shouldn't uh uh excuse me elijah shouldn't have been doing if it's anything elijah whatever it was god had to do god had to prepare elijah for this god there had to be something more in elijah to get him to this place than what he had and there's got to be more that comes into this bride through the revealed word that hasn't been before now that's the light on the other side of the wall somebody flipped it there's got to be something more see and that something more has got to come from the word through christ yeah who is the word amen right so he sends elijah down to cut on him a bit and when the brook ran dry god sent him where he sent him to zarephath to a widow woman amen now again i'm going to cut this a little short look at the word zaraphat the definition of the word zerophath means refining so once god has cut away that's when he does some refining now this may sound crude for him but i just got to give it to you because it wasn't a note i had and god just dropped it in but it's like a fingernail if you ever have a fingernail that you don't chew on that you actually uh you actually have fingernails that you groom what do you do to a fingernail you take something you cut it the excess off well that gets rid of the unnecessary part of your nail correct then what do you do you take a file and you start filing it and refining it down take away the sharp edges take away the jagged parts and and refining it to where when you go to scratch yourself you don't rip your face open you refine it well that's what god had to do to elijah he not only cut it away but then he come in and he took and he refined it right it's like a uh it's like one of brother brown's message you listen to a lot of brother brown's message my goodness you just take that absolute hide right off you right but then when you get to that and now if you stop right there you're going to be heidless but if you keep on going and you listen to the rest of it right then he puts that salve in there and he starts the bomb of healing and then he starts refining and then bringing it over and people's hearts become tender and they get to the place that they're receptive and when they're at the place of receptiveness then he can call a prayer line or something and people's faith is at a peak that god did miracles and wonders in that ministry amen amen because it was the faith i know the promise of the angel said not even cancer will stand before your prayer but it had to be faith because that's the bible right right even the promise of the angel could not leave the pages of this bible amen everything he told him and everything that happened had to be scriptural if you can't find it in the scripture there's something wrong right so the the point that we know that brings that healing is the faith amen it's got to be that level and that point of faith and that faith is what the people received and they got blessed by a lot of people got healed a lot of unbelievers got healed people that may have never followed the message or went to church again got healed amen but it was because of the simple faith that they had gotten being there in that atmosphere and in that presence that faith it's the same thing that we strive for every day but especially like we're here right now amen god had to cut on elijah a little bit he had to get elijah ready then he had to refine him and he had to bring him up to the place he cut off all the rough edges and all the points and and make him refine to the place that he was ready spiritually because after this of course he goes back to elijah and he calls the rain back down after three and a half years but after that it was the mount carmel showdown right now friend you're not going to have a mount carmel showdown unless you're prepared for it if you try to do a mount carmel showdown without spiritual preparation in your life you will be defeated right amen you will be destroyed you will come back pardon this expression but with your tail between your legs as a defeated person right but when you're prepared and god has cut god got you through the the preparation and and the building up and the cutting and the refining and your faith is at that place that you can call down heaven to destroy it all amen and then you gotta show down the name god will make himself known in your life praise god god is preparing us for a rapture friend amen the cutting the refining yes the word because it's not it's not it's brother madam didn't do it it's the word that does it amen it's not a minister pastor that does it it's the word that does it god's the one that does god's the one that brings that cutting god's one that brings that preparation and he had to prepare him for that he has to prepare us and get us to the place that we can receive that promise when it comes down upon us amen but look what happened he was so depleted after the mount carmel showdown and one woman he defeats 400 profits he has buckets and barrels and gallons of water licked up by the fire of god and all the altar and everything around it men cutting themselves like you know people try to do today right you know that's a sign of the devil right yes that cutting that's the devil you go there's places in the bible that tells you that's of the devil amen you see these young people out here today who try to cut themselves for relief that's a satanic element of the devil don't you do something like that that is ungodly amen these ungodly men up there cutting themselves and god sends that and licks up every bit of water every bit of wood every bit of stone everything that was there god the fire of god came and licked it up and one woman after he's done somebody turned it off again one woman after it's done threatens him threatens his life and he runs like a scared cat right like a rabbit with the coyotes on his tail runs and he goes underneath the juniper tree and he says god just kill me just kill me i'm a dead man anyway just kill me i'm the only one left god just just kill me give take me home get me out of here a lot of people do that today wow amen oh god it's just over anyway i don't want to live anymore just take me home just you know god's got you here for a reason if god has got you here he's got you here for a reason and when it's time your time to go god will take you sorry don't wish your life away let god take care of that right let god handle you god will take care of that if god gets you here there's got to be a reason you say well i don't see it i don't understand it don't matter god's got it under control you just trust him and god will lead you in the place he wants you to be he might only have one other person to speak one more word to but you're the only one that can do it that's right just be a willing subject to let god use you to do it amen but you're here for a reason but elijah oh god take me i just want to die i just want to die a lot of people think the same thing friend i don't want to die i want to live don't get me wrong i'm ready to go home when the lord takes me home but i want to live i love my children i love my grandchildren i love my church i love you people i love being a life i enjoy life i don't want to die but but i'm ready to go home when it's still when the lord's done with me i'm ready to go praise the lord but elijah i'm the only one left god said i got 7 000 have about the need of bail i got 7 000 you don't know anything about right you say you're the only one you're not the only one i got plenty of others out there praise god he falls asleep under the juniper tree and god wakes him up with an angel and an angel wakes him up and feeds him some cakes amen aren't you glad that god can strengthen you by an angel with some cakes or that god can strengthen you by an angel with some tapes no right amen that god could strengthen you by an angel with some tapes amen amen god's still doing the same thing today it continues to press you on and move you forward and bless you in the middle of all that's going on around us that's right it may look grim it may look dark me and my wife went out for dinner last night and i'm gonna say this and uh i i might i'll probably read this quote but i'm gonna leave it there but we went out to dinner last night and they had these some sayings on the wall and she sent one on the tablet some of them was really funny about the colgate thing but one of them was a cat that was pursed in a carrier and the door was shut and the cow was just sitting there looking at the door and the door was shut so it was just sitting there but the whole top of the carrier was gone there was no talk to the carrier but the cat was just sitting there and the saying was don't get so fixated on the problem that you don't see the obvious answer right you don't see the obvious escape people sometimes get so tunnel visioned and so blinded about the the problems they don't understand the way of escape right the solution that is obvious right there all the cat had to do was look up and he said he's not in a box the door's shut yes but the whole top's gone he doesn't get out of the boat amen he gets so fixated on that but all the other stuff goes to the side i mean you think about the three hebrew children yeah they were they were literally thrown in the fiery furnace right but in the middle of the fire god was there with them amen daniel was literally thrown in the lion's den but in the middle of the hungry lions god stayed their mouths amen said hi kitty kitty go lay down in the morning king all well daniel all's well okay right praise the lord the bride today all is well all is well i've heard the message shalom peace all is well amen praise the lord amen you got this one world thing is settling in all this taking place around us you know it reminds me i i meant to say this a couple weeks ago but i don't know if you knew this but current president trump actually declared publicly first president i know of that did this publicly most of them who belong to a domination even you know won't even say they're catholic or something actually publicly declared he is no longer i think it's presbyterian he now considers himself a non-denominational christian right right that's first president i ever known right you know he's not gonna be present much longer doesn't look like but he's the only president i've ever heard in my lifetime that declared themselves as a non-denominational christian no wonder they hate him so much right you know brother roger told me that they had south africa during this coverage coveted stuff completely locked down nobody in out could move breathe do anything and as soon as biden was declared winter they opened it up said everybody can come in everybody can go out it's all free do whatever you want now everything's fine you watch a lot of the news is going to die down here real quick too on that coveted stuff but anyway i call it the great masked caper of 2020. first seal uh don't get mad at me that's just my that's just my feeling opinion everybody has an opinion you're entitled to yours too that's okay maybe that's my opinion why did communism raise up over here in russia it just makes me sick at my stomach to hear all these preachers hollering about communism they don't even know what they're crowing about that's right communism listen now listen what's in our front doorstep here now remember so they cry socialism but that's just communist junior right he said they're no don't know what they're crying about that's right communism ain't nothing it's a tool brother brahman said communism is a tool in the hand of god to bring revenge upon the earth for the blood of the saints amen amen that's right i just thank god that bride we are not going to be here to witness that right amen when they have to seal their their testimony with their blood and after the church is taken away rome and the jews will make a covenant with one another of course i'm not going to read it all but later they break that covenant of course the pope does but rome and the jews make a covenant together the bible said they would with the holy people and now notice they'll make it because why the nation is going to be busted amen and he's saying going to be i say is yes how many trillions of dollars do you have to be in debt to be busted how many zeros is in a trillion dollars i can't even fathom it sometimes me and my wife go to taco bell because it's cheaper i can't even imagine a trillion dollars right how many tacos could you buy with a trillion dollars that would be a lot or in my case rib eyes that's a lot of money so the point is that how many trillions of dollars do you have to be in debt to be busted which we are as a nation amen especially especially the last 12 years well we'll just say since 9 11 2001 right yeah this nation has gone yeah or we'll just say up with the debt it is skyrocketing republican or democrat it is skyrocketed 20 some trillion dollars you look at the debt clock and it just flips it's amazing but 1963 this nation is going to be busted this nation shall i declare this day this prophecy fulfilled this nation is busted amen like all the rest around the world no matter what they say they're all coming together and the rest of the world that's on the gold standard is busted too you know that if we're lit we are now living off the taxes for bills due 40 years from now and that was 1963 wow if we took every single dollar that came in to the government around the country for the entire year it wouldn't even touch our debt wow oh man every dollar that came in wouldn't touch it right think about that it's gross domestic politic but i don't want you know that's all technical stuff this ain't dollars money wouldn't even touch it all the taxes everything that goes in wouldn't even touch it there's only one thing that can happen that's to call the currency pay off the bonds and they can do it wall street owns them and wall street is controlled by the jews the rest of it is controlled by the vatican now you know why after the bride is gone they will make a treaty with one another because one owns one side of it the other is on the other side of it that's right and well i bring this point again as i close here this pope has the highest approval rating amongst jews of any pope ever according to statistics the greatest approval rating amongst muslims jews christians nominals worldwide got a brand new catholic in the supreme court that's right got a brand new catholic in the oval office if the if the democrats get control of the senate a catholic will be the head of the senate ahead the speaker of the house is a catholic nancy pelosi who is third in the line of presidency if something happens to the top two right where are we at friend right we're at this place god is letting us know just like we read when god did this through moses he let him know and he let pharaoh know god spoke through moses and let pharaoh know this is going to happen to you pharaoh and this is this is what this is what god's not going to do you're going to be the recipients of every firstborn dying from man to beast but israel won't be touched amen not even a dog tongue wag praise the lord not only will we be sustained friend look god if you're god you're part of god we're all god's children god's continuing to bless his children in the middle of this crisis in the middle of this turmoil that's going on around us god is continuing to bless us amen in in in in every way my encouragement submit yourselves therefore unto god amen resist the devil yes and he will flee for amen amen amen let's stand today praise the lord amen i'm so glad god has provided the way for his children to be blessed when it looks like darkness is surrounding and it is when the bible says it'd be darkness in the land and gross darkness to the people the grosser the darkness is the brighter the light shines right hallelujah you can look you can light a candle in this room and it won't look like much but at night time if you turn all the lights off and light a candle you could probably see all the walls right right it'll shine bright and as the darker it gets the brighter it's going to shine the brighter your light is going to shine praise god light shiny relinquish everything we're in god's preparing us for this time god is showing us revealing to us letting this word come forward an issue from us his people in that preparation believe it let god have its way in your life lord live victorious amen you don't know what i'm going through well i don't know what most of us are going through you don't know what we go through i'm going through but we all know that whatever we're going through god blesses us amen god takes care of us i'm old enough and i'm not the oldest one here but i'm old enough to know that as long as i've been serving the lord that in the middle of all of what goes on in my life or my family or church whatever god always brings it out and blesses it always always happens sometimes god brings situations that you thought were unfallible to an end maybe that thing became a crutch in your life and god had to stop it that's some of the cutting that elijah had to go through sometimes god may take that from your life right but you take that and you move forward and let god refine you and bring you forth and refining refining just means that i've become more like him amen that's all i want to do amen the potter the clay the potter takes the clay and just molds it cuts it shapes it refines it to where it it fits the image that he had in his mind that's all god tries to do for us we just want to fit that image amen amen praise the lord jesus amen blessing us you're blessed today amen amen let's sing it to the lord now believe it sing it like you believe it

in mind he also has you in mind right amen and that's where we need to be in the mind of christ amen praise the lord her family i know priscilla has confided in me family's gone through a tremendous purging right now god does that yes you know god does that he's doing that to this country i believe right now god does that to his children right we come to crossroads we get the place where god does
