[37:04] dust this Earth from when our bodies
[37:06] came Lord giving you thanks and praise

[37:11] morning because there was life In This
[37:13] Cloud of dirt and Lord it and this
[37:16] little cloud of North Carolina dirt
[37:18] decided and in its heart it wanted to

[37:50] Our Hearts and lives to strengthen us
[37:52] once again to give us what we need for
[37:55] the continuing battle in this world that
[37:57] we live God and it is getting worse
[37:59] every day we know that lord it's it's
[38:02] it's obviously prophesied in the
[38:04] scripture we knew it was going to happen
[38:06] Lord and we've seen it progress in my
[38:08] lifetime I have at once it seemed like
[38:10] it was a slow progression but Lord now
[38:14] it it it just seems
[38:15] like there's giant leaps of of
[38:19] ungodliness that take place every day we
[38:22] live yes and it's it's just getting us
[38:26] to the place that we realize Lord we
[38:28] more and more that we just don't belong
[38:30] here this this is not our place of
[38:33] residence we're sojourners we're
[38:34] pilgrims this is not where we belong
[38:37] this is not where our home is Lord It's
[38:40] it it will eventually but right now in
[38:42] this Cosmos this world order it has
[38:45] nothing to do with who we are and what
[38:47] we believe and how we stand and how we
[38:49] live God may you just continue to help
[38:52] us Lord with all the uh all the strength
[38:55] that you can give us God in our lives to

[39:07] upon them that they might see it too

[40:36] blessings in the name of our Lord Jesus
[40:38] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[40:42] Matthew 11 1 verse 25 as we have in this
[40:46] series amen at that time Jesus answered
[40:50] and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[40:51] Heaven and Earth because that has hid
[40:53] these things from the wise and prudent
[40:55] and has revealed them unto babes amen
[40:58] you could be seated if you'd
[41:01] like amen we actually had kind of a
[41:04] another sort of I guess you not really
[41:07] title but uh sub subtitle I guess to the
[41:12] last uh the the last uh message that we
[41:15] had based on our our uh our drawing here
[41:20] not really a drawing but our writings um
[41:23] about uh when the enemy comes in a flood
[41:26] God raises up a standard against it and
[41:29] it I really appreciated the brothers
[41:32] that came in and spoke since so maybe
[41:34] this was ordained of the Lord after all
[41:36] I said I might have waited to do this
[41:37] till today but actually after I did this
[41:40] and then what brother nol and what
[41:41] brother John brought uh really
[41:43] solidifying this was was a tremendous
[41:46] blessing uh to know that uh the what God
[41:51] has placed in us and who we are in him
[41:53] and brother John talking about the rock
[41:55] that we run to and the the strength that
[41:58] God gives us and raising up that
[42:00] standard and and knowing that that
[42:01] standard that God has already given to
[42:03] us that that standard is already in
[42:05] place in our lives that we are that
[42:07] standard that God raises up that he uses
[42:10] for us to be able to overcome all the Ws
[42:12] of the devil that standard that we saw
[42:15] here that we wrote out and this we're
[42:17] not going to really refer to this as
[42:18] much today but I just wanted to bring it
[42:21] up here to just kind of bring a
[42:22] refresher about how through the church
[42:25] ages and how important it was uh how
[42:28] important it was and and in many other
[42:31] ways how important it was that God uh
[42:34] bring an opening of the seals for this
[42:37] day uh and that would bring a revelation
[42:40] of that word to to a prophet and then to
[42:43] us as we individually receive that
[42:46] Revelation from God and what it meant to
[42:49] us down and what it meant to them down
[42:51] through the church ages uh to recognize
[42:54] even from Ephesus to l TOA and how each
[42:57] one of these had its own point and
[43:00] purpose because we know the church that
[43:02] was inside of each one of those and of
[43:05] course the bride age that we talked
[43:07] about that was a part of each one of
[43:09] these because I call that now I know
[43:12] brother Brown talked about the bride age
[43:14] in this last day but there's the bride
[43:18] component in every one of these Church
[43:20] ages and that bride component was
[43:23] anointed by all of the the the the Beast
[43:27] anointings that we read last time uh
[43:29] about each one of these was that
[43:31] anointing for that day the lion
[43:33] anointing the Cal or ox or laboring
[43:36] anointing the man anointing the
[43:37] intelligence and bringing forth uh uh uh
[43:41] ushering in uh the the eagle age for the
[43:46] intelligence of man to be able to have
[43:48] what we have to do what we do and to go
[43:50] where we go and uh to be able to have it
[43:54] uh for for God to send a prop profit and
[43:56] for that word to be revealed for the
[43:59] fullness of the word to be able to come
[44:01] it had to go through each one of these
[44:04] anointings each one of these anointings
[44:06] was upon each one of those that were
[44:09] that were Believers in that day bride of
[44:11] that day were a part of that anointing
[44:14] they were anointed to do what they did
[44:16] that God used these spirits to move on
[44:20] them uh even like we said in the Dark
[44:23] Ages where we we seem to talk about a
[44:26] lot uh because of the dramatic nature of
[44:29] what the bride went through in that day
[44:32] uh of that Ox anointing the Bible says
[44:35] calf but Brown refers to as ox or a
[44:37] laboring anointing it was their
[44:40] anointing to go to uh a burning steak it
[44:44] was an anointing to them to go and and
[44:46] like I said I believe that uh when these
[44:49] things took place as dramatic as they
[44:51] were as hard as it would have been on
[44:53] them physically I believe when they
[44:56] stood there at that burning
[44:57] Stak the feeling the lick of fire dance
[45:01] across their legs I didn't I I don't I
[45:03] don't think they felt that pain uh I I
[45:06] believe that anointing was there to
[45:08] cover and to shroud them and to help
[45:10] them be able to uh fulfill the purpose
[45:14] that they had that God gave them for
[45:16] that day they were just as important
[45:18] just as needful uh as we are today as
[45:22] this last day as any of those ages were
[45:25] cuz that that corn of wheat that seed
[45:28] had to go that bride seed that word seed
[45:30] had to go into the ground and die and
[45:33] root to re to be reborned again which is
[45:36] nothing more than a reflection of Jesus
[45:39] of them in the Garden of Eden a
[45:41] reflection of mzc a reflection of Jesus
[45:43] Christ a reflection of our own New Birth
[45:47] yes our own New Birth of ourselves dying
[45:50] out so that there has to be a new life
[45:52] raising in US amen God always
[45:55] continually referring to his word
[45:58] bringing his word to pass amen of course
[46:01] each one of those anointings that we had
[46:03] that we get down now we're obviously
[46:06] going to Major on the Leo deia Church
[46:09] age and the last year the eagle
[46:11] anointing uh the loosening of the holy
[46:14] spirit for this last day God sending a
[46:17] prophet now notice God did not send a
[46:20] prophet to any of these other ages God
[46:22] gave brother Branham the names of men
[46:26] whom he used as reformers if you will at
[46:28] those days that were there as a
[46:31] representative of that time amen We
[46:33] Major on Luther and Wesley of course the
[46:36] last two uh the with the Sardis in
[46:38] Philadelphia Church ages but we know
[46:40] that each one had St Martin and Paul and
[46:43] each one of these that had had that
[46:46] person that was there so since Paul
[46:48] there was not a prophet you had
[46:50] reformers and and those that God would
[46:53] just open remember the seal were like a
[46:57] scroll uh well you could even look at it
[46:59] in in in in a regular book if you just
[47:02] look at it in a regular book uh you can
[47:05] take a book and you can open it to this
[47:07] page but that doesn't reveal what's on
[47:09] this page it just reveals what's on this
[47:12] page yes and through the times God would
[47:16] allow the pages of Revelation if you
[47:20] will to be open uh brother R talked
[47:23] about as a scroll as one would unfold
[47:25] and then the next would unfold and then
[47:27] the next just because you see this page
[47:30] doesn't mean you see this page right but
[47:33] it's God unfolding it but what God
[47:36] wanted to do for us for this last day
[47:39] and one of the things that separates as
[47:41] we see the bride the church is to reveal
[47:44] to the bride by Revelation from God to
[47:48] reveal to her who she is in this word by
[47:52] the full revelation of the word for this
[47:55] last day
[47:56] it had to take a full Revelation not
[47:59] just a part here A Part there uh we know
[48:02] it took a word profit uh for God to
[48:05] reveal to him that uh this uh uh St
[48:09] Martin had this part right and and
[48:12] brought it in and said this is true even
[48:15] with calvinist and Armenian ISM uh
[48:19] brother random just took the truth from
[48:21] each one both of them one was off one
[48:23] side the other uh they take they take
[48:25] what they believed and they went off
[48:27] with it but they went off to the side
[48:29] they left the word at some point and and
[48:31] it took a prophet a word Prophet to take
[48:33] those things and bring them back to a
[48:36] truth back bring them back to a
[48:38] realization in the word but now the word
[48:42] had to be
[48:43] revealed before you could know that that
[48:46] was the truth of God's word that wasn't
[48:49] a man-made tangent or a or a man-made
[48:52] Dogma idea it had to be by Prophet to
[48:56] show that that was the word that was to
[48:58] be for this day that God would show to
[49:01] us and that's showing to us help reveal
[49:05] that word to us and where we belong in
[49:07] the word amen where we belong in the
[49:11] word now you can have a house you can go
[49:13] on the front sto doesn't tell you what's
[49:16] in the kitchen amen you can go get you a
[49:20] bottle of water out of the fridge in the
[49:21] kitchen but that doesn't tell you what's
[49:22] in the bedroom amen you can go in the
[49:25] bedroom you can enjoy a good nap but
[49:28] what happens when you need to go to the
[49:29] bathroom never been there don't know
[49:31] what that's about but see in this day
[49:34] the entirety of it God shine light on
[49:38] the entirety of it so we can know that
[49:41] who we are and how we belong in there
[49:44] amen what what it is to us for that word
[49:47] to be revealed to us for this last day
[49:50] amen now the god takes that Revelation
[49:55] and and and and shines it's a
[49:59] light it's it's it's a manifestation of
[50:02] some Revelation is is a manifestation
[50:05] the realization of God's word truth of
[50:07] God's word to you amen that's why it's
[50:10] called Revelation amen a manifestation
[50:13] is something that a multitude of people
[50:16] could see at one time but a revelation
[50:18] is something that's personal to you only
[50:20] you see that amen it's something that
[50:23] belongs to you now when God does this
[50:27] there's there's it brings a
[50:31] separation uh there's a separation in
[50:34] the word a lot of people a lot of
[50:36] christiandom does not recognize the
[50:40] separation between the church and the
[50:42] bride uh they believe that they're one
[50:44] and the same in fact if you have a
[50:46] Scofield bible like I do most of my
[50:48] studying in a scoffield Bible you see
[50:51] that even in scoffield notes he he
[50:54] conflates the two
[50:56] he does not separate bride and church he
[50:59] basically his notes and his commentary
[51:01] is is is really reflective of the belief
[51:06] that the bride and the church are the
[51:07] same but they're not right amen they are
[51:11] not the same they are not the same group
[51:13] that's why a lot of people have the
[51:15] misunderstanding that the bride goes
[51:17] through the tribulation the bride does
[51:19] not go through the tribulation the
[51:22] church does but the bride does not one
[51:25] of the greatest differences one of the
[51:27] most pronounced differences between the
[51:29] bride and the church is the church goes
[51:32] to the tribulation the bride does not
[51:35] amen we'll get to that a little bit
[51:37] deeper in a minute let's go over to uh
[51:39] Romans chapter 4 Now read a couple of
[51:47] scriptures Romans 4 we'll start with
[51:49] verse 6 Romans
[51:54] 4:6
[52:00] now this is
[52:02] uh uh probably in my opinion now there's
[52:05] several differences but to
[52:08] me probably the greatest difference the
[52:12] thing that differentiates the most
[52:14] between the church and the bride amen
[52:17] the church again goes through the
[52:20] tribulation there's a reason for that
[52:22] the bride does not and there's a reason
[52:25] for that amen now Romans
[52:30] 4:6 even as David also describeth the
[52:33] blessedness of the
[52:35] man unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[52:39] without
[52:40] words saying blessed are they whose
[52:43] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[52:47] are covered praise the Lord and that's
[52:49] all that in the quoting of
[52:53] David the the great re revelation of
[52:55] David's day without the Holy Ghost was
[52:59] simply the forgiveness of sin or the
[53:02] covering of sin we know now by the
[53:06] bleach blood through God in Simplicity
[53:09] the bleach blood of Jesus not only
[53:13] forgave not only covered but annihilated
[53:18] sin the whole point of the bleach blood
[53:22] of Jesus was that when the drop of ink
[53:26] was was dropped into a tub of
[53:29] bleach that ink separated and every
[53:32] molecule that made up that ink broke
[53:35] down into such a uh such a a minute
[53:39] amount in in inside that bleach it was
[53:43] no longer
[53:44] visible the ink disappears in the bleach
[53:48] because the bleach was made in such a
[53:51] way that it would break down every
[53:54] molecule everything that made up uh the
[53:57] ink blot everything that made up that
[54:00] drop of ink the bleach was
[54:03] manufactured to break down and to get
[54:07] rid of now if you were to take the
[54:09] bleach and you were to examine it amen
[54:13] you might find the molecules that made
[54:16] up that ink I don't know I'm not a
[54:18] scientist but I know that when the ink
[54:21] goes in the bleach it is gone you can no
[54:24] longer longer see it amen it breaks it
[54:28] down to its
[54:30] original it it it takes what it
[54:34] became and it and it and it breaks it
[54:37] apart and takes it back to its original
[54:40] state whatever that is atoms of carbons
[54:44] I don't know I'm not smart enough to be
[54:47] to know that science whatever it is
[54:49] somebody spart of me can come explain it
[54:51] but the truth of it is when when that
[54:54] drop of ink is broke down into that tub
[54:57] of bleach and and and and dissolves it
[55:00] down back to its original state all it
[55:04] does to me even though I can't
[55:07] understand it and can't explain it what
[55:09] it tells me is that every drop of sin
[55:13] that Satan ever tries to account to you
[55:16] is broken down to its original place by
[55:19] the blood of Jesus Christ and who is the
[55:22] originator of
[55:24] sin Satan himself praise God that's why
[55:28] brother random said that goes to the
[55:30] head of Satan and lays on him till the
[55:33] day of judgment amen every sin that he
[55:36] tried to put on you belongs to him amen
[55:40] because that drop of ink in the tub of
[55:42] bleach hallelujah it's not just forgiven
[55:46] Saints you know what brother brandom
[55:48] said about forgiven in invisible union
[55:51] he said you are
[55:53] Justified Justified means means as
[55:55] though you never did it he even give the
[55:59] example with brother green he can say
[56:01] brother green could come along and did
[56:03] and say I forgive you brother
[56:05] Brandon forgive me for what I never did
[56:09] it but I forgive you for it but I didn't
[56:12] do it amen Justified means though you
[56:16] never did it so who did it amen the
[56:20] devil did amen it lays on him he gets
[56:25] accounted at the white Throne judgment
[56:26] friends he gets accounted for every one
[56:29] of those that he tried to pin on you
[56:31] belongs to him amen praise the Lord the
[56:35] purging of sin see the importance David
[56:39] in the vision that he had calling on the
[56:42] importance blessed are
[56:44] they whose iniquities are forgiven and
[56:47] we know what iniquity is are forgiven
[56:50] whose sins are covered blessed is the
[56:53] man to whom the the Lord will
[56:57] not
[56:59] amen if I was
[57:01] a TV preacher i' tell you to repeat
[57:03] after me but I don't do that but to
[57:08] me will not impute sin amen
[57:14] oh just to think about Saints God does
[57:19] not impute them to you that's where a
[57:22] lot of people get caught up in their
[57:24] minds that's where a lot of people get
[57:26] defeated even in their own walk even in
[57:28] their own Christian walk they get
[57:30] defeated because the the devil will
[57:33] continually bring those things and
[57:34] bombard you with things you know that
[57:37] maybe you thought or did or said or
[57:39] something that may have been off color
[57:40] or shouldn't have been said or done or a
[57:42] little temper or something the devil
[57:44] will always bring that back to you but
[57:47] the truth of it is when it's gone into
[57:51] the tub of
[57:52] bleach it's his not not yours
[57:56] amen God does not will not impute that
[58:03] sin to you and that is that that impute
[58:06] just means to reckon it to you to put it
[58:09] on your account yes what does that mean
[58:14] that means that no sin gets put on your
[58:19] account no sin right no unbelief sin is
[58:24] unbelief
[58:26] no unbelief is put on your
[58:30] account praise the
[58:32] Lord could you imagine going to the
[58:34] grocery store or
[58:37] to Lord help
[58:40] Walmart just for and and you go up and
[58:42] you say uh just put it on my account
[58:46] just put it on my account just put it on
[58:48] my account just put it on my account and
[58:51] you go in the next time to the same
[58:53] grocery store how how much I owe you I
[58:56] told you put this last batch of
[58:57] groceries on my account well sir you
[58:59] don't owe anything no I had all this I
[59:02] wanted this put on my no it's it it I'm
[59:05] looking at the account there's nothing
[59:07] on your
[59:08] account you don't owe me anything you
[59:12] don't owe us a
[59:13] DME praise the Lord it cannot will not
[59:18] be put on your account Hallelujah God
[59:21] doesn't even recognize it hallelujah
[59:23] amen the only place he recognizes it
[59:26] through his by his bride is on the head
[59:28] of Satan amen amen the new birth
[59:33] beautiful amen changes things let's look
[59:36] at this now the four
[59:38] seal brother
[59:42] Brown brother Rand puts it this
[59:45] way how anyone can get the church going
[59:49] to the tribulation I don't know and
[59:51] we're going to talk more about the
[59:53] tribulation in a moment
[59:55] um what it's got to go through the
[59:58] tribulation
[1:00:00] for when it hasn't got a single
[1:00:05] sin I mean I don't mean the church the
[1:00:08] church will go through the
[1:00:11] tribulation but I'm talking about the
[1:00:14] bride amen and and I had done some
[1:00:18] research and I knew because a lot of my
[1:00:21] research uh and a lot of what I read and
[1:00:24] and listen to and uh is is a lot from 63
[1:00:29] to 65 now I do listen to others but the
[1:00:33] majority of uh if if I do a search I
[1:00:37] start actually I start from like 60 the
[1:00:39] last quote that would involve something
[1:00:42] uh and work my way backwards because I
[1:00:45] know that as brother Ram's Ministry
[1:00:48] matured uh there was things the Lord
[1:00:50] showed showed revealed to him later in
[1:00:52] his ministry especially after the were
[1:00:54] revealed that he did not know earlier or
[1:00:58] that he might have had a little
[1:00:59] different take on it at the time amen so
[1:01:02] as his ministry matured God revealed
[1:01:05] things to him uh he put things in
[1:01:09] different context so I would start with
[1:01:11] the last so when I do that I start with
[1:01:14] the last and walk forward well in doing
[1:01:17] that I notied obviously through the last
[1:01:20] three years of his ministry brother bam
[1:01:23] re separated the church and the bride
[1:01:26] early in brother Ram's Ministry he
[1:01:28] conflated them just like scofi and so
[1:01:30] many others they were they believe the
[1:01:33] church believed that they were one the
[1:01:34] same body But as God began to reveal
[1:01:37] this to him around about the time that
[1:01:40] the seals were open were revealed right
[1:01:44] about that same time is when is when
[1:01:46] brother brandom started seeing
[1:01:49] recognizing that there was a that they
[1:01:51] were two different
[1:01:53] groups one came out of the other the
[1:01:57] bride came out of the church but they
[1:01:59] were two separate groups the church was
[1:02:02] one group the church through the church
[1:02:04] ages and then the bride the bride inside
[1:02:08] each one of those Church ages there was
[1:02:10] a bride and there's two and there were
[1:02:13] two separate groups and brother B
[1:02:15] started recognizing that so as he's
[1:02:17] talking in the for seal you can't
[1:02:21] obviously because like I said from what
[1:02:23] I saw and could find that was about the
[1:02:26] same time that brother Brown be to
[1:02:28] divide the two so you can't blame him
[1:02:30] for at first saying the church going to
[1:02:33] the tribulation amen because this was
[1:02:36] something that the Lord had just put in
[1:02:39] as a revelation to him in his ministry
[1:02:42] that that the church and the bride were
[1:02:43] separate amen that's why you see brother
[1:02:46] random catch himself here he says I
[1:02:50] don't mean the church I mean the church
[1:02:53] will go through the tribul ation but I'm
[1:02:55] talking about the bride the bride does
[1:02:58] not go through the tribulation praise
[1:03:00] the Lord as he said what does she have
[1:03:03] to go through the tribulation for yeah
[1:03:06] amen amen we'll talk about that in a
[1:03:08] minute the
[1:03:10] bride the bride won't no it hasn't got a
[1:03:14] sin against it at all it's been bleached
[1:03:18] out and if you're a member of that bride
[1:03:21] you are a part of that word
[1:03:24] amen he says the bride but you're a part
[1:03:28] of that bride yes praise the Lord that
[1:03:31] means I'm a part of that word
[1:03:35] yes amen it's done been bleached out
[1:03:38] there's not even a smell of
[1:03:42] it not even a smell of it amen there's
[1:03:47] nothing left there you're perfect before
[1:03:52] God perfect before God
[1:03:54] now he doesn't say you're perfect before
[1:03:56] your mirror or you're perfect before
[1:03:59] those that are around you but you are
[1:04:01] perfect before God praise the Lord amen
[1:04:05] amen so what's any tribulation uh what's
[1:04:10] any tribulation to purify them but the
[1:04:13] others do amen the church now I'll read
[1:04:17] this I I I want to come back to this
[1:04:19] thought but I'm going to go ahead and
[1:04:21] read it here cuz we just read the
[1:04:23] scripture blessed is the man to whom God
[1:04:25] will not impute
[1:04:27] sin
[1:04:29] um the church does go through the
[1:04:32] tribulation but not the bride the church
[1:04:36] goes through the tribulation but not the
[1:04:38] bride and he goes on to talks about Noah
[1:04:42] going through the tribulation but Enoch
[1:04:44] representing the bride who raptured
[1:04:46] before the tribulation Noah went through
[1:04:49] the tribulation the cross on top crested
[1:04:53] the way aves if you will went over every
[1:04:57] tribulation that there was and made it
[1:04:59] onto the other side of the tribulation
[1:05:02] amen that was that was a type that he
[1:05:05] had of course uh that we know is
[1:05:08] obviously a part of a a part of the word
[1:05:13] now
[1:05:16] obviously
[1:05:17] there's there there's a purging period
[1:05:22] yes there has to be a purging period for
[1:05:26] everyone yes everybody that that ex that
[1:05:30] expects to have be in this life there
[1:05:33] has to be a purging period you have to
[1:05:36] if you're going to get into that life
[1:05:38] there has to be a time of purging in
[1:05:40] your life you cannot live the way you
[1:05:42] were born and be a Christian I just say
[1:05:45] it simply that way you cannot you cannot
[1:05:48] live the way you were born and be a
[1:05:49] Christian you cannot there has to be a
[1:05:52] purging period there's a Time the bride
[1:05:56] that purging period for her is the new
[1:05:58] birth she receives the Holy Ghost the
[1:06:01] Holy Spirit lives in her she she dies to
[1:06:05] her old self Amen brother Ram talks
[1:06:08] about the devil writing writing of
[1:06:10] divorcement putting in the sea of
[1:06:12] forgetfulness she
[1:06:14] is divorced her her old her old ways die
[1:06:19] her old nature dies and she is
[1:06:22] reborn into a new life into a new nature
[1:06:26] a new spirit the spirit of God Amen now
[1:06:30] the spirit of God lives in each
[1:06:33] individual yes
[1:06:35] amen you know it by the fruit they
[1:06:39] bear an orange seed produces an orange
[1:06:43] tree an orange tree produces oranges you
[1:06:47] can see it when you walk by it there's
[1:06:49] an orange tree don't have to guess about
[1:06:52] it and I'm probably as far from aist as
[1:06:55] anybody could be but when I walk to my
[1:06:57] apartment and I see these oranges
[1:06:59] hanging off of this tree I don't have to
[1:07:01] wonder whether it's a sycamore tree or
[1:07:03] whether it's a pecan tree I know it's an
[1:07:05] orange tree because there's oranges
[1:07:07] hanging off of it amen I think that
[1:07:11] pardon the pun in a nutshell is what
[1:07:14] brother null was trying to get across to
[1:07:16] us for the a couple of services to
[1:07:20] recognize it was him and us and if he's
[1:07:24] in us we do what he did yes we live his
[1:07:27] life yes amen amen there there's no
[1:07:31] guesswork I if if somebody recognizes if
[1:07:34] somebody sees you I know this world is
[1:07:37] getting further removed from it to where
[1:07:39] they can't identify it like they used to
[1:07:41] used to be years ago uh there would be
[1:07:44] no question you see a Christian it
[1:07:46] identified itself people look at youday
[1:07:48] and just think you're a freak you're
[1:07:50] just a nut you're just crazy person uh
[1:07:53] you're old fashion living in the stone
[1:07:55] ages or whatever they want to think they
[1:07:57] they it doesn't Dawn on a lot of people
[1:07:59] today that you live the way they do you
[1:08:01] act the way they do you talk the way you
[1:08:03] do you dress the way you do because
[1:08:04] you're a Christian nothing else but
[1:08:07] because you're a Christian amen you're
[1:08:09] not crazy you're crazy for Jesus but
[1:08:12] you're not a nut to the world you are
[1:08:15] but to us this is the way God's word we
[1:08:20] conform Into His Image yes into his life
[1:08:24] likeness not because we make ourselves
[1:08:27] or put some kind of mask on but because
[1:08:29] we are bored into it amen an orange tree
[1:08:34] doesn't go around in the middle of the
[1:08:36] night trying to find orange tree oranges
[1:08:38] that another tree dropped and stick them
[1:08:40] up on his limb so that when you wake up
[1:08:42] in the morning you think he's an orange
[1:08:44] tree no he oranges just come out of him
[1:08:50] cuz that's what he is praise the Lord
[1:08:52] amen oh it's
[1:08:54] so it so gets us to the point to
[1:08:57] understand
[1:08:59] why uh why things are the way they are
[1:09:02] why we are the way we are why we do what
[1:09:05] we do why we live the way we live and
[1:09:07] act the way we Act and why the world
[1:09:09] acts the way they act why they do the
[1:09:12] way they do but now our purging comes
[1:09:15] when we we have a new birth the new
[1:09:17] birth takes place in us we repent God
[1:09:19] fills us with his baptized in the name
[1:09:21] of Jesus Christ filled with his spirit
[1:09:23] and when the spirit comes and God and
[1:09:26] begins to grow that that seed that life
[1:09:29] in you begins to grow and it produces
[1:09:32] Jesus Christ amen amen I'm not calling
[1:09:34] myself Jesus Christ but that seed will
[1:09:37] produce Jesus Christ amen that's why so
[1:09:41] many people believe brother Brandon was
[1:09:43] God to this day because they conflated
[1:09:46] the understanding of of a carnal
[1:09:49] interpretation of a spiritual
[1:09:51] Revelation they they they looked in and
[1:09:53] they said wow that's just I I see the
[1:09:56] scripture living again this must be no
[1:09:59] it wasn't is God in a man just like it's
[1:10:02] God in us amen but it's like brother no
[1:10:04] said the most perfect example that we've
[1:10:07] had In Our Lifetime is William Brown the
[1:10:11] most perfect example of Jesus Christ
[1:10:13] I've ever met or ever known I didn't
[1:10:15] meet him but ever known heard
[1:10:18] affiliation of some sort was William
[1:10:20] Brams only one I know of closest one I
[1:10:23] know
[1:10:24] but every one of us are striving to get
[1:10:27] to that place yes amen we want to we
[1:10:30] desire to it's in our hearts to want to
[1:10:34] but now the other group they have to be
[1:10:36] purged at a different time amen and
[1:10:39] that's what the tribulation is for the
[1:10:41] tribulation the Great Tribulation serves
[1:10:44] two
[1:10:45] purposes it's a judgment on the wicked
[1:10:49] and it's a purification of the
[1:10:52] church it's a it's a judgment on the
[1:10:55] wicked which it will be a judgment that
[1:10:58] will lead up to the white Throne
[1:11:01] judgment and it is a purging time for
[1:11:04] the church it's a purging time for the
[1:11:06] Jews it's a purging time for those who
[1:11:09] did not get their purging by the new
[1:11:11] birth amen that's why you see uh uh
[1:11:16] that's why you
[1:11:18] see the foolish virgin the way they are
[1:11:21] we'll read that in a minute but let me
[1:11:23] read this first first John I'm going to
[1:11:26] read I've read this several times here
[1:11:28] over the past few
[1:11:30] months and I told you before the Lord
[1:11:33] just keeps bringing me back to the
[1:11:34] scripture so I'm just as long as he
[1:11:35] keeps bringing me I'm going to keep
[1:11:37] reading it
[1:11:38] amen who who whosoever committs sin
[1:11:41] transgresses also the law for sin is the
[1:11:44] transgression of the law for if you do
[1:11:45] not believe if you do not believe then
[1:11:50] it's not going to pertain to you amen if
[1:11:53] if you don't believe that that the
[1:11:55] government means what they say when they
[1:11:56] put a 45 mph speed limit stick there out
[1:11:58] here if you don't believe that and you
[1:12:00] just go 100 and they stop
[1:12:03] you you're going to do whatever you want
[1:12:05] because you don't believe it if you
[1:12:08] don't believe Christ if you don't
[1:12:09] believe his word then why would you obey
[1:12:12] something you don't even believe right
[1:12:14] why would you try to conform to live in
[1:12:17] something that you don't even believe
[1:12:18] amen amen they don't believe whosoever
[1:12:21] committed sin unbelief right
[1:12:24] transgresseth the law just their simple
[1:12:26] unbelief is a transgression of the law
[1:12:28] for sin is the transgression of the law
[1:12:30] and ye know that he Christ was
[1:12:34] manifested to take away our sins and in
[1:12:38] him is no sin right praise the Lord
[1:12:41] that's why he could take our sin away
[1:12:44] whosoever abideth in him sinth not
[1:12:47] whosoever sinth has not seen him neither
[1:12:50] known him little children let no man
[1:12:52] deceive you he that doeth righteousness
[1:12:55] is righteous even as he is righteous
[1:12:57] even as God is righteous let me read
[1:13:01] that again little
[1:13:02] children newon Ben it Newton don't let
[1:13:06] any man deceive you he that does
[1:13:10] righteousness
[1:13:11] amen is righteous right praise the Lord
[1:13:17] what is
[1:13:18] righteous Christ the word amen he who
[1:13:22] does lives why the word is
[1:13:26] righteous robed in his
[1:13:29] righteousness without a spot wrinkle or
[1:13:32] blemish praise the
[1:13:34] Lord the bride who is she she's the
[1:13:37] sinless Bride of Jesus Christ yes cannot
[1:13:42] cannot cannot be a sin accounted to her
[1:13:46] God will not will
[1:13:50] not put a sin on your account
[1:13:56] praise the
[1:13:58] Lord even as he is
[1:14:00] righteous praise the
[1:14:03] Lord thank God for that he that
[1:14:06] committed sin is of the devil if you
[1:14:08] don't believe you're of the devil for
[1:14:09] the devil sinth from the beginning
[1:14:10] although the devil believes
[1:14:14] amen uh kind of puts a little twist on
[1:14:17] that here because sin is unbelief but
[1:14:20] the sin but uh the is of the devil the
[1:14:23] the devil sinth from the beginning amen
[1:14:26] that is to
[1:14:27] disregard Satan knows God there's he
[1:14:31] believes in God probably more than most
[1:14:34] people Satan believes in God but he
[1:14:36] doesn't believe who God is right doesn't
[1:14:39] believe in the the uh omnipotent
[1:14:43] almightiness of God of he is he is the
[1:14:47] soul or is to be the soul object of
[1:14:51] worship which is of God for this purpose
[1:14:55] the Son of God was manifested that he
[1:14:58] might destroy unbelief or the works of
[1:15:00] the devil sin that's why he was born now
[1:15:04] to some that has taken place to us that
[1:15:10] has taken place the works of the devil
[1:15:12] in your life has been destroyed in the
[1:15:15] bride The Works of the devil have been
[1:15:19] destroyed because you cannot sin
[1:15:24] praise the Lord hallelujah you cannot
[1:15:27] disbelieve thus God will not put a sin
[1:15:31] on your account hallelujah amen praise
[1:15:33] the Lord that's our that's happened
[1:15:35] through the manifestation God himself in
[1:15:38] flesh revealing himself to us coming in
[1:15:40] human flesh coming in the form of the
[1:15:43] Holy Ghost now to live in us to prove
[1:15:46] that he is still God he's still the same
[1:15:49] yesterday today and forever manifested
[1:15:52] destroy the words of the devil now in a
[1:15:53] lot of people The Works of the devil
[1:15:55] still manifest they still work but in
[1:15:58] the bride and those that have been
[1:16:01] purged those that have received that
[1:16:03] atonement they have been purged they to
[1:16:07] them the destroy the works of the devil
[1:16:09] have been
[1:16:10] destroyed whosoever is born of God and
[1:16:14] again always go to the ninth verse
[1:16:15] because this always ties it up for me
[1:16:17] the ninth verse whosoever is born of God
[1:16:21] does not commit sin amen for his seed
[1:16:25] God's seed remaineth in him and he
[1:16:29] cannot sin because he is born of God I'm
[1:16:34] sorry friend but you can no more sin
[1:16:37] disbelief than God can right can't do it
[1:16:41] you can make a mistake in your flesh you
[1:16:44] can think something your flesh your
[1:16:46] spirit your human Spirit your human body
[1:16:48] you can react in a certain way that's
[1:16:50] ungodly that's the human nature of you
[1:16:53] amen we try to suppress that as much as
[1:16:56] possible and let the Lord live his life
[1:16:58] through us so more of us can die amen
[1:17:02] but that's not what he's talking about
[1:17:04] amen he's talking about the seed that
[1:17:06] remaineth in you that's God's that's
[1:17:09] what God's looking at God's not looking
[1:17:11] down and seeing how well you combed your
[1:17:13] hair this morning amen God's not looking
[1:17:17] down and seeing what color clothes you
[1:17:19] have on how well that you uh present
[1:17:22] yourself
[1:17:23] all that's just a reflection of who you
[1:17:25] are of course but that's God's looking
[1:17:27] down and he sees the soul of man he's
[1:17:31] looking down and he sees the soul in you
[1:17:33] that the seed of God is there he he sees
[1:17:36] his own reflection yes Amen in you his
[1:17:40] own reflection yes praise the Lord amen
[1:17:43] now let's go over to Matthew chapter 25
[1:17:46] I want to finish this
[1:17:50] up now that brings us again him the
[1:17:54] understanding of why
[1:17:57] why we are considered a sinless people
[1:18:01] why the bride is considered a sinless
[1:18:04] people not without fault or mistakes but
[1:18:07] sinless why is she considered sinless
[1:18:10] because of the new birth yes the new
[1:18:12] birth reconciles all that to understand
[1:18:16] that's who we are that's right it's a
[1:18:18] new birth that makes you sinless which
[1:18:20] which means what it's not you it's him
[1:18:23] because the birth is his birth in you so
[1:18:26] it's not you anyway you accepted it you
[1:18:29] received it we all have our free moral
[1:18:31] agency of course we can decide to not to
[1:18:34] whatever but God is the one that that
[1:18:37] has brought all this plan around to make
[1:18:40] it work and live in your life that's how
[1:18:43] you're sinless amen amen the
[1:18:47] church has not reached that
[1:18:50] place the church did not re does not not
[1:18:53] reach that place here mean that's why
[1:18:55] the church goes to the tribulation
[1:18:57] that's why the church does not go in a
[1:19:00] Rapture the Rapture is solely for the
[1:19:02] bride God's wife solely for the bride
[1:19:06] amen let's read uh we've gone through
[1:19:08] this many times Matthew 25 the 10
[1:19:14] virgins and keep in mind now remember
[1:19:17] keep in mind the purpose of the of the
[1:19:20] tribulation uh I was going to read
[1:19:24] uh Revelation 6 again but we'll maybe
[1:19:26] next time we'll see uh we're we always
[1:19:29] go through uh most of the time when the
[1:19:32] when the seals are preached on
[1:19:34] Revelation six preached on we go through
[1:19:36] the fourth seal and we stop because that
[1:19:39] ends the church ages because we're we're
[1:19:41] bride and after that you know the bride
[1:19:44] goes in a
[1:19:45] Rapture she's no part of the rest of it
[1:19:48] the fifth seal is soul under the altar
[1:19:50] are the
[1:19:51] Jews they're not just Gentiles
[1:19:53] anyway Saul's on the altar crying uh how
[1:19:57] long Lord those are Jews not even
[1:19:59] Gentiles and of course the Sixth Seal is
[1:20:01] the is the Tribulation period
[1:20:04] tribulation period for judgment on the
[1:20:07] wicked amen judgment on the wicked but
[1:20:10] it's also a time of purification you
[1:20:12] ever heard brother Brown talk about how
[1:20:15] these and we we'll read it here but
[1:20:18] these These Foolish virgin they have to
[1:20:21] they have to seal their testim because
[1:20:23] they have a testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] notice Let me just read
[1:20:27] it then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[1:20:29] liken unto 10 virgins which took their
[1:20:32] lamps went forth to meet the
[1:20:34] bridegroom five of them were wise five
[1:20:37] were foolish they that were foolish took
[1:20:39] their lamps and took no oil with
[1:20:43] them but the wise took oil in their
[1:20:47] vessels with their lamps amen not just
[1:20:52] their lamps but their vessels as well
[1:20:56] the wise while the bridegroom carried
[1:21:00] they all slumbered and slept they all
[1:21:02] slumbered and slept at midnight there
[1:21:03] was a cow made behold the bridegroom
[1:21:05] cometh go ye out to meet him then all
[1:21:08] all the virgins arose and trimmed their
[1:21:10] lamps and the foolish said unto the wise
[1:21:13] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[1:21:14] gone out so obviously they had oil
[1:21:17] obviously they had the Holy Ghost but
[1:21:21] they only had an anointing of the Holy
[1:21:24] Ghost their lamp amen the thing that
[1:21:27] shines out a lamp is something that
[1:21:30] people see when you when you you ever
[1:21:33] heard anybody say their light their
[1:21:35] smile lights up a
[1:21:37] room yeah your lamp amen not your spirit
[1:21:42] not your soul your your your your outer
[1:21:45] being is your lamp your smile lights up
[1:21:48] a room your presence brings other people
[1:21:50] Joy whatever that's the light lighing up
[1:21:53] a lamp so they had oil in their lamps on
[1:21:58] their flesh but it was simply an
[1:22:00] anointing they obviously were not born
[1:22:03] again right they weren't born again
[1:22:06] because they didn't have something out
[1:22:09] inside them continuing to keep them
[1:22:12] going uh from the soul Spirit
[1:22:17] body so when their anointing went out
[1:22:21] when the anointing Liv Ed when the
[1:22:23] anointing was no longer present they had
[1:22:26] no oil right they had no Holy Spirit and
[1:22:29] they were but they were smart enough to
[1:22:31] ask the
[1:22:32] wise give us of your oil our lamps are
[1:22:35] gone out if they had been born again
[1:22:38] their lamps would not have gone out just
[1:22:40] to have a simple anointing is not enough
[1:22:42] Saint amen just to have a nice tingling
[1:22:45] on the flesh or a nice feel to say oh I
[1:22:47] like this group of people or boy this is
[1:22:49] a good place or just feel the tingling
[1:22:51] or something or just an anointing of
[1:22:53] some kind of speaking in tongues or
[1:22:54] prophesying or something that's just a
[1:22:56] gift that doesn't mean that you're born
[1:22:58] again doesn't even mean you're a
[1:22:59] Christian amen amen but they were
[1:23:02] virgins they were virtuous now
[1:23:05] notice all 10 of them had not defiled
[1:23:08] theirselves with any man with any
[1:23:10] Doctrine with any church with any Dogma
[1:23:13] they stayed pure amen so so even though
[1:23:17] the the foolish virgin even though this
[1:23:20] church uh has to go into the tribulation
[1:23:24] it's simply for purging it's not for
[1:23:26] judgment it's for purging am because
[1:23:29] they did not
[1:23:30] receive the Holy Spirit they got an
[1:23:33] anointing but they didn't have the Holy
[1:23:35] Spirit but they were a group that was
[1:23:38] still a virtuous fruit they still claim
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ they still believed God
[1:23:43] they still believe truth they they they
[1:23:45] they maintained their their spiritual
[1:23:48] selves amen and I'm not talking about
[1:23:50] virtuous as in physical virtu I'm
[1:23:52] talking about spiritual virtue am they
[1:23:55] were spiritually virtuous they had not
[1:23:57] defile defiled their spiritual uh uh uh
[1:24:01] lives with Dogma with with church church
[1:24:06] or or or some kind of Dogma or man-made
[1:24:09] idea they did not defile them defile
[1:24:12] themselves spiritually they stayed
[1:24:15] virtuous the only difference was they
[1:24:17] did they they weren't born again yes
[1:24:20] amen they received a nice anointing on
[1:24:22] the flesh but they were not born again
[1:24:25] their lamps went out they asked the wise
[1:24:27] give us some of yours but the wise
[1:24:29] answered night ver saying not so lest
[1:24:32] there not be enough for us and you but
[1:24:34] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[1:24:36] for yourselves and while they went to by
[1:24:38] the bridegroom came brother maram talked
[1:24:40] many times about that church going to
[1:24:43] try to search that oil to search the new
[1:24:46] birth amen the church does not get
[1:24:49] it uh but they but they'll they'll go
[1:24:52] searching for it they'll try to find see
[1:24:55] how this how this works uh uh where this
[1:24:59] comes from how this comes about Amen
[1:25:02] brother raham talked about going and
[1:25:03] looking searching for this they went to
[1:25:05] buy the bridegroom came and they were uh
[1:25:09] and they that were ready went in with
[1:25:11] him to the marriage and the door was
[1:25:13] shut afterward came also the other
[1:25:15] virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but
[1:25:17] the Rapture had already taken place the
[1:25:20] door was shut Rapture was gone the
[1:25:22] brides out of here the Christian virgin
[1:25:25] bride is
[1:25:27] gone those that were
[1:25:29] left are either the ones that are in
[1:25:33] judgment or being purged and we can you
[1:25:35] can read the end of Matthew 25 and you
[1:25:38] can see where at the white Throne
[1:25:40] judgment God separates the two groups
[1:25:43] amen those that were being judged go to
[1:25:45] his left hand and they get cast into
[1:25:47] Everlasting fire those that don't go to
[1:25:50] his right hand and they're and they're
[1:25:52] granted eternal life amen we find that
[1:25:55] group again Lord willing next Sunday
[1:25:57] we'll find that group again in MA in in
[1:25:59] Revelation 7 but let's continue on here
[1:26:04] the door was shut 11th verse now
[1:26:06] afterward came also the other virgins
[1:26:09] saying Lord Lord open to us they still
[1:26:12] were a group that was calling him
[1:26:13] Lord but I want you to notice something
[1:26:16] as I finish verse uh 121 13 look here
[1:26:19] but he answered and said verily I say
[1:26:21] unto you I know you not watch therefore
[1:26:24] for ye neither know the day nor the hour
[1:26:26] wherein the son of man cometh but I want
[1:26:28] you to get something re uh uh verse 11
[1:26:30] and
[1:26:31] 12 afterward came also the other virgin
[1:26:34] saying Lord Lord open to
[1:26:38] us but he answered and said verely uh
[1:26:41] said verily I say unto you I know you
[1:26:42] not now I don't not I do not want you to
[1:26:44] get this group confused with the with
[1:26:48] the group in Matthew 7 uh 2122 2 and 23
[1:26:53] do not conflate those two groups do not
[1:26:56] get those two group they are not the
[1:26:57] same group Amen in Matthew 7 2122 23 a
[1:27:03] group comes and says Lord Lord haven't
[1:27:05] we done these great works haven't we
[1:27:06] done this that and the other haven't he
[1:27:08] said depart from me ye workers of
[1:27:10] iniquity I never knew you he does not
[1:27:14] say that here right amen he does not
[1:27:17] tell the five foolish I never knew you
[1:27:20] and if you go look at the new and no KN
[1:27:24] and e w k and o w is two completely
[1:27:27] different Greek
[1:27:28] words you can look them up two
[1:27:30] completely different Greek words some of
[1:27:32] the subtext is a little the same but
[1:27:36] they have two different meanings I never
[1:27:38] knew you as in relationship is one group
[1:27:42] that God said you are working
[1:27:45] iniquity I never knew you as in
[1:27:49] relationship right amen never
[1:27:53] in this group that I know you
[1:27:57] not is is that no
[1:28:01] means if you will uh it basically means
[1:28:05] I'm ignoring
[1:28:07] you he's not telling them I I never knew
[1:28:11] you right he's just telling them I'm not
[1:28:14] paying attention to you right I'm
[1:28:16] ignoring you why would God do that amen
[1:28:18] well why did God do that when they were
[1:28:21] banging on the door Noah to try to get
[1:28:23] in oh we're sorry we're sorry we're
[1:28:25] sorry let us in we repent we repent no
[1:28:27] it's too
[1:28:28] late but we're here now we believe we
[1:28:31] want in no too
[1:28:33] late it's too late they come to him and
[1:28:36] say Lord let us in no it's too
[1:28:40] late you had your
[1:28:42] chance uh uh I'm I'm pardon this but I'm
[1:28:45] ignoring you I'm not listening to you
[1:28:47] right too late you had your chance it's
[1:28:49] over yes and that's that is the justice
[1:28:53] and Judgment of God yes that's just God
[1:28:56] is is is is perfect he he is a god of
[1:29:01] Mercy a god of love a god of Grace but
[1:29:03] he's also a god of judgment and he's a
[1:29:06] god of his word yes amen and and and
[1:29:09] that is where he's established and when
[1:29:12] it when when the line's drawn and the
[1:29:14] door is shut it's shut you don't open it
[1:29:17] amen it's done but it does not mean that
[1:29:22] this this group of people is lost
[1:29:24] completely to the Lake of Fire like the
[1:29:27] other group when he says I never knew
[1:29:30] you right depart from me workers of
[1:29:32] iniquity I never knew you two different
[1:29:35] groups yes two different things yes amen
[1:29:38] amen this group will come up later but
[1:29:41] they come up later at the end of this
[1:29:43] chapter actually which did separates the
[1:29:45] sheep from the ghost they come up later
[1:29:48] but they don't come up until after the
[1:29:50] tribulation period so the bride now
[1:29:53] revelation of Matthew 25 the bride has
[1:29:56] gone into the Rapture door is shut and
[1:29:58] the church excuse me the church the
[1:30:02] foolish
[1:30:03] virgin they go into the tribulation
[1:30:06] period yes amen and they have to seal
[1:30:10] their testimony with their own blood
[1:30:12] right they have to be purged yes amen at
[1:30:16] the end of the tribulation period which
[1:30:18] we may talk about again a little bit
[1:30:20] later I don't intend to get into the Jew
[1:30:22] part of the the Jewish part of this
[1:30:24] quite so much but at the end of that is
[1:30:27] when uh in fact I
[1:30:30] um uh most definitely will uh the it it
[1:30:35] becomes a purging period for the Jews
[1:30:37] too remember we went through that before
[1:30:40] and and the sixfold uh vision of Gabriel
[1:30:44] amen finish the
[1:30:47] transgression yeah we'll get into that
[1:30:49] again but it it is for for the Jews too
[1:30:52] but it becomes a purging period the
[1:30:54] tribulation becomes a purging period for
[1:30:57] those who were not born again amen amen
[1:31:00] that's why they don't fall in the same
[1:31:03] category as the
[1:31:05] bride that's why they don't reach the
[1:31:07] same statue status as the bride amen
[1:31:10] that's why the bride goes through goes
[1:31:12] into the Rapture not the tribulation and
[1:31:14] the church goes through the tribulation
[1:31:17] the bride does not need any purification
[1:31:20] because there's not one smell of sin
[1:31:23] about her amen praise God there's not
[1:31:27] one sin held to your account yes not
[1:31:32] one praise God so what does she have to
[1:31:34] that's why we read I read this why
[1:31:37] brother R said why does she got to go
[1:31:38] through the
[1:31:40] tribulation she's perfect before God why
[1:31:43] does she she doesn't need any purging
[1:31:45] amen the two purposes of the tribulation
[1:31:48] judgment and purging and neither one
[1:31:50] does the bride fit in that's why why
[1:31:52] would she go through the
[1:31:53] tribulation amen Amen brother Aram
[1:31:56] talked about why why uh why a man would
[1:32:00] love a woman so much that he would want
[1:32:02] to make her his wife and then and then
[1:32:04] take her home and then beat her to a
[1:32:06] pulp I love you
[1:32:09] honey you're such a
[1:32:12] sweetheart why would he do
[1:32:14] that he doesn't right that's the whole
[1:32:17] point he doesn't there's no purging the
[1:32:20] bride has to go through that's why
[1:32:22] that the bride goes into the Rapture
[1:32:25] amen the church does not she has not
[1:32:28] received the Holy Spirit she's got to
[1:32:30] seal her
[1:32:31] testimony amen look now seven seal now
[1:32:36] she's not the bride but it's the church
[1:32:38] the pure people that don't have the
[1:32:40] opportunity maybe to receive the message
[1:32:41] or in some way they were blinded false
[1:32:43] prophets didn't get a chance and yet
[1:32:46] they're really sincere in heart well of
[1:32:48] course the bride the Bible calls them
[1:32:50] virtuous amen virgins they stay pure yes
[1:32:54] and God knows their heart and here
[1:32:56] they're purged purged during this time
[1:32:59] what time tribulation yes sealing their
[1:33:02] testimony with their own blood you
[1:33:04] notice that another purging time that's
[1:33:06] for Israel when she gathers now he's
[1:33:08] talking about the Jews here that's the
[1:33:10] second fold God purges Israel in that
[1:33:13] tribulation period amen
[1:33:16] amen praise the
[1:33:20] Lord
[1:33:25] amen thank you Lord let me read just one
[1:33:28] more I'm going to skip some here amen
[1:33:32] let's get to this we'll close here and
[1:33:34] you got to remember too now during this
[1:33:36] tribulation period there is this the
[1:33:39] there are no more
[1:33:40] anointings people talk about well they
[1:33:42] went through the Dark Ages and they had
[1:33:44] this and seal their life and
[1:33:47] stuff but they had an anointing that
[1:33:49] anointed them they they had a protection
[1:33:52] they had a keeper that anointing the
[1:33:54] Holy Spirit was there there will be none
[1:33:56] when the tribulation sets in no
[1:33:58] anointing No Love No peace no joy no no
[1:34:02] Holy Spirit no anointing amen the spirit
[1:34:04] goes back to the Jews the Jews are the
[1:34:07] ones that have the Holy Spirit God's
[1:34:08] dealing with them at this time Gentiles
[1:34:11] nothing dead
[1:34:13] empty this church has to go through this
[1:34:15] purging period with absolutely no
[1:34:17] anointing it
[1:34:19] sounds uh it sounds bad but that's just
[1:34:22] the fact of it people say well maybe
[1:34:25] they're foolish virgins oh have mercy
[1:34:27] Lord no why would anybody want that yes
[1:34:30] amen I mean that's better than going to
[1:34:32] hell but uh who would want to go through
[1:34:35] the tribulation period amen amen this
[1:34:38] purging time where there's there's no
[1:34:40] anointing then during the
[1:34:42] tribulation amen read this let me read
[1:34:44] this one more no no he
[1:34:47] said let me see we're
[1:34:49] U this is a question and answers uh
[1:34:52] number
[1:34:53] 392 I like to say that in case anybody's
[1:34:56] WR down or wants to go look it up no no
[1:34:58] no you're I wish that I could have more
[1:35:01] time on that see the bride when she's
[1:35:03] taken from the church the bride taken
[1:35:05] from the church then the church age will
[1:35:08] cease leoda goes into chaos uh he also
[1:35:13] talks about leoda going into predition
[1:35:16] amen it it runs itself out into
[1:35:19] Armageddon and so forth
[1:35:22] the bride goes to glory and the
[1:35:24] tribulation period sets in upon the
[1:35:26] sleeping virgin for three and a half
[1:35:29] years while Israel is getting its
[1:35:31] prophecy three and a half years second
[1:35:34] half of Daniel 70 weeks then tribulation
[1:35:37] set it upon Israel then comes the battle
[1:35:39] of Armageddon which destroys the whole
[1:35:41] thing right amen the bride does not go
[1:35:45] through the
[1:35:46] tribulation Church
[1:35:48] does separation those that that have
[1:35:51] been born again and those that have not
[1:35:53] yes amen God brings a complete
[1:35:56] distinction between the two amen that
[1:35:58] the bride she goes into she goes into
[1:36:01] the Rapture yes that's what we're
[1:36:03] waiting on the bride is waiting on a
[1:36:05] body change she's waiting for that time
[1:36:08] which I believe all of us would agree
[1:36:10] this right at hand she's waiting for
[1:36:13] that time looking longing Lord just any
[1:36:16] day now amen praise the Lord let's stand
[1:36:19] if we could
[1:36:27] amen praise the Lord you love the Lord
