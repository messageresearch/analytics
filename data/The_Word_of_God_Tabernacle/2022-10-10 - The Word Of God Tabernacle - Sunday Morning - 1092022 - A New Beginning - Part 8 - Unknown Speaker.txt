I don't have anything nobody's text or called um today or this week so I don't have anything in particular uh written down thank you buddy uh Joel is so diligent to make sure he gets those prayer requests you know I I got to be honest if it was me I'd probably forget them half the time we're kind of on our job we're kind of responsible for clocking in and out which seems you know uh some places I guess they probably wouldn't it's the basically honor System you know you can clock in when you won't clock out they trust you to be clocking in and out when you're working and not working or going to lunch or whatever and half the time I forget to clock in clock out we're always asking each other what time do we quit lunch what time you know forgetting all the time but Joel is all he always remember every day he's every Sunday he's right on the spot with him and I appreciate it it's a big help to me so I don't have to remember it but he remembers that I don't have to my sister Julie has a prayer slash praise he said I want to thank the Lord I have not had any pain this week except for one day praise the Lord amen amen soon to be no dates also I want to thank him for the lab results showing nicotine in my apartment which those you don't know she's been getting a lot of smoke in her apartment we prayed about this we had prayer requests from a neighbor that's not supposed to be smoking and an office has done very little to nothing about it and now she's got proof uh tests that the nicotine the smoke is coming into her apartment so much that nicotine showed on the test

action amen so we do remember that in prayer amen and thank God you've been feeling better amen we have sister we have three from Sister normal are all these prayer requests or any prayers they're all

again from another word of prayer Precious Jesus father we're so thankful again that your grace and mercy overshadows us blesses us strengthens us brings us to this place Lord of worship and a praise and expecting and looking for you God to speak to us and to minister to our hearts and lives and doing the exceeding abundantly above all that we can ever ask for things yes we recognize Lord within ourselves we are insufficient father even though we are your creation father based on our free moral agency Lord we have the opportunity the ability to choose to make decisions and Lord so many times we fall fail make mistakes but Lord you're always there to help us and pick us up and strengthen and blessing us Lord and showing us that path and putting that Mark again continuing right in front of us Lord and we want to make sure that we stay on that straight narrow God and head straight for that Mark Jesus Christ and not very to the right or to the left in any way the Lord we come to this place now expecting you to meet with us Lord know that you already have but believing Lord that you're going to continue to manifest yourself in power and demonstrations and that faith is going to be raised to such a level God that we could receive whatever we have need of today because your word says faith come by hearing the word and your word went forth and healed them that's what brings faith in our lives Lord and we're going to receive and believe today we feel the pulsation of that Spirit God moving through US Lord each one today God may you bless those that have come Lord those who may be streaming those who may not have been able to make it all the prayer requests and needs that were made known father we pray that you bless your bride worldwide father whoever they may be wherever they may be I don't know them all Lord but they're every one in the palm of your hand and you cannot lose one they're my brothers and sisters and we love them Lord God and Lord we're all a part of that same mystical body of Jesus Christ now we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and praise for all that is said and done may your word go forth and Grant whatever your desire is for it for this day as we commit it to you now and ask your blessings again on in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord Genesis chapter one I will read the first couple of verses again in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and void and darknesses upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen you could be seated if you'd like amen now I want to go to Genesis chapter 12. amen I started reading there again as I said uh we finished off last week with the feast days and the type of understanding of of what God's dealing with and doing with the Jews and what God's dealing with and doing with us Gentiles today and how the two frankly matched together to to some degree uh bribe going in a Rapture and at the end of the marriage supper Christ comes down and reveals himself to his people and they recognize what they had done at the end of the tribulation period uh and then we go from there of course to the Millennium but we're ending up in that new city that's again it's the focus that we're looking on for this series and the new beginning that new beginning really is uh there's the new beginnings that we keep talking about but the focus of the new beginning of this series of course is that City a man that New Jerusalem Revelation 21 that we'll end up to but I want to talk about our father of Faith Abraham today and Genesis 12 we'll begin our reading there let's go over to uh uh well let's just start with the first verse Genesis 12 1. God dealing with Abraham now listen now the Lord had uh now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from my Kindred and from my father's house unto a land that I will show thee now can you imagine how miraculous this really is can you imagine how um uh how our faith-based this really is to understand that a voice that spoke to Abraham which if people today said they heard a voice they would give you a they would put you in something they'd give you a constant hug of yourself uh it's called a straight jacket you're continuously hugging yourself so they would think you're crazy rubber room because you're hearing voices well Abraham Abram heard this voice and God's speaking to him by faith Abraham believed that that voice was the almighty God even though he wasn't necessarily really raised that way he felt that that was the voice of God and now this voice is telling him to leave everything that was dear to him or almost everything everything that he loved lead your father leave your comfort zone get out of uh out of the comfort of your life there in your father's home and all that you have and all will find it's everything that you've got that you see that you do go I want you to leave and go someplace I got something for you amen now Abraham believed that and and as we will read Abraham obeyed that right and he went forth and left almost everything that he had looking to follow Christ now it finds it seems a rare thing today that people will forsake and leave everything or almost everything I took his wife and his nephew with him and servants and animals and things but his father the Comfort let's just put it that way the comfort of the life that came with Abram being in his father's house he had to lead that Comfort to go to follow Christ to go to follow the word to go to follow the command of God he had to leave that and a lot of people are very unwilling they're they're willing to say they're a Christian they're willing to go to church they're willing to do the semantics and the religious rights that we uh that that the scripture that we afford that we do but they're unwilling to relinquish everything that they have and obedience to what God's word would tell them Abraham was willing to do that by faith he did it amen and we know that the only way that we can serve God that we can please God Is by faith yes so sometimes it takes us in serving God I know this may bite but sometimes it's serving God it takes us out of our comfort zone it takes us away from now sometimes you may be in the same place you may be in the same surroundings but something will happen to make your life uneasy to make your life uncomfortable to make your life sometimes even I could say the word miserable to the human flesh but God is working a greater purpose than every one of our Lives God is working a greater work for us so that we become like him and sometimes it takes that adversity to put us in that place yes and that's what God is expecting of Abraham and if God was expecting that of Abraham here as we read this he's expecting that of us today he's expecting us many times to get out of our comfort zone to lead the things that that seem to be that that the Comforts of the world and the Comforts of humanity in the Comforts of life to follow Jesus Christ yes he did it he left all this because God told him now recognize this this is a God not unlike us that Abraham had never seen Abraham didn't have pictures hanging on his wall he had never seen this God this God didn't even tell him who he was yellow him he's the old Shaddai he's I mean how many uh Jehovah-jireh titles that that were given to Abraham but Abraham didn't he didn't see him it wasn't something tangible it wasn't something he could he could feel or touch or see but he still believed it he still believed him because he is something inside of Abraham that called to him when that voice spoke and again not unlike today in each one of the Believers each one of God's children just like that little Eagles story there's something that's inside when that cry Goes Forth that rings out to that that responds to that cry very much the deep cause of the deep when Mama eagle flew over a little baby might have been hatched in the chicken yard but when she heard that screaming witnessed to her heart to that little eaglet it witnessed to him and said now that sounds more like something I identify with right I don't identify with the world I don't identify with the things of the world I've been uncomfortable here for years so many times that's what drowned themselves in tobacco and alcohol and drugs and illicit living and gambling and all the things that the life tries to to hide and to push all that down but inside there of God's children when that cry Goes Forth there's something that responds to that very much and Abraham had that responder that that responded to the voice of God when God spoke to him it's time to move it's time to get out of your comfort zone it's time that the Eagles pulling out all the stuffing from the nest and the little eaglets starting to sit down on a big Thorn and say oh this isn't as comfortable as it used to be this doesn't feel as good as it used to be where's all my cushion gone no it's time for you to get out of this nest and go fly on your own yes because there's a purpose that God has God had a purpose for Abraham and so many times just as it is just as it was in brother Brown's life just as it wasn't Abraham's life just as it was in Moses like just like it was in Jesus Christ and so many of the men of God just like it is in our lives God used Abraham Abram as an example for us to read and look at today and be an example to us to see what God is doing what God is what God did what God is doing what God is going to do we're going to examine some of the doing and going to do today as we as we reflect on the Dead now God now the Lord said to Abraham let me read it again said unto Abram get out of thy country and from by Kendrick and from thy father's house into a land that I will show thee in other words just go just start walking I'll show you where am I going don't worry about that which direction I had don't worry I'll show it to you just keep you just walked I'll show you Prince that's hard yeah you think why Abraham's Abraham but that's hard he was a human being that's hard to do to think well but where am I going everybody wants this well what's going on what what's the end result where am I headed where am I going to end up well there may be uh uh thieves out there there may be murders out there that may be no just walk I'll take care of you I'll show you where to go you just start walking okay Lord uh I'll just do I'll just start walking and you know so many times it God just wants you to walk and you might think well is is is this going to happen well is this gonna be in the way is this don't worry about it I told you to walk just walk amen and I will make of thee now this is the promise I will make it thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee that same is to Israel same thing today whoever blesses Israel is blessed whoever curses Israel's curse I will bless them that bless thee and I will curse them that curse thee and then thee shall all families of the earth be blessed praise the Lord that's quite a promise amen as the sand of the sea as the stars of the sky it's a blessing but it's the promise but that's a but look the point I'm trying to make and I'll move on is that to to normal human thinking these are just words I I've had people make promises to me all the time and it never happened I've had people tell me all kinds of stuff of things that do this it never comes to pass never happens a lot of times if I ever see that person again they act like you know it never happened they never said it or their promise never existed or you know or all human these in the humanity these were these are just words so there had to be something beyond that for Abraham to respond I believe that when God tells me this it's going to happen he's going to do what he said he would do amen again the anchor is Faith only way is to be able to have faith to believe so Abram Departed as the Lord had spoke unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 70 and five years old when he departed out of Herod and Abram took Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Herod and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came as God showed him obviously and Abram passed through the land unto a place of shechem Unto the plain of Mora and the Canaanite was the Canaanite was in the was then in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land and they're building he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him and he removed from fence unto a mountain to the east of Bethel and pitched a tent having Bethel on the west and Ayah on the East and there he building an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord worship amen worship by faith you always believe that Faith's got to be the anchor but the worship then comes he worship and Abram sojourned going on still toward the South now let's go to the book of faith Hebrews chapter 11. see where God recorded this event in Hebrews chapter 11 it's only a couple of verses right but it is very descriptive what was the point of it why was God sending him out you know the the bottom line of the faith the moving on the voice of God believing that when God speaks we act as he speaks to it but what would be the purpose because God does just God doesn't just willy-nilly do things he there's always a reason why God does things now we may not ever know those things it may be a while before we ever know those things or if we ever know him at all but God has a reason God has a purpose and he is mine he knows what he's doing and why he's doing it so we look at the story and then we go to Hebrews now of course there's a lot more to that story and we'll come back to Genesis before we end up this service but and there's a lot more of the story so if you go read it if you haven't already or re-familiarize yourself with it there's more to that story but the recordation of it by Hebrews gives a a a why if you will and it's and it and it's the why that I that we are focused on now that Y is really the purpose of this entire series let's read uh Hebrews chapter 11 verse 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went but he did it by obedience remember obedience is better than sacrifice amen obedience by faith he uh by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise now notice it's the land of promise it's the land that God gave him but yet he's still wandering around intense uh in a strange country like a stranger so Journey Like a Stranger in a land that God promised to give him if God promises to give you something friend it's as good as yours I don't care what a piece of paper says I don't care what anybody's opinion or a judge or a potentator anybody else says if God gave it to you it belongs to you it's yours amen that's how that's my approach to my family it they belong to me God give them to me didn't give them to the devil gave them to me don't belong to him don't belong to the world belong to me they're mine they're my possession but as he had that possession he still wandered around as a stranger right like a Sojourner he's sojourned in this land as in a strange country it was his God gave it to him it's yours but he still wondered amen why did he wander look at this in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles Isaac Jacob The Heirs of the same promise for he looked Abraham's looking for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God that's why he was so unsettled that's why I continued even though he was in the land of promise that's why he continued to sojourn around and Tabernacles and temples and uh Tabernacles and sojourning and houses and Tents because he's looking for this city he's in the promised land but he's still looking for that City amen look friend we may be in our Promised Land which is the Holy Ghost amen and if you have the Holy Ghost you are because the Holy Ghost is our Promised Land amen but you're still lucky you're still so Journey yes you're still wandering around because this place is not home even though this Earth is exactly where we're going to live you get it but still wandering around so Journey like a soldier this this world is not my home this place doesn't this is not mine this this is the inheritance of the devil amen all this atmosphere not the Earth but the world the cosmos all the governments all the banks all the money all the everything that God blesses us with and we're thankful God gives us things that bless us like Micah said in his prayer but this world is not our home God just bless us to be able to have a place to live and have a place to stay in car driving job and money and things to provide to eat to live but this place is not our home amen even though we've received the promise we're in our Promised Land we're still so Journey as as strangers amen because we look around and we and and it's like I've told you before I go in and out airports all the time now I look at people all the time and I look and I think I I hope I pray some of these people have something inside them more than what I'm looking at I really do amen like the homeless people I I hope there's something more in there that I can't see right now that God knows that he sees but I look at this and I think I am the Oddball here I I'm this Earth belongs to me Jesus brought it back bought his bought it back with his own blood and now it's our inheritance we're coming back to live on this Earth but this place is the I I don't fit in here very much I I stand out like a sore thumb and I'm a man in this message so if I'm a man of this message I think of how you sisters feel yesterday in Dallas I saw a woman in her in her little two three little girls walking down and that I'm sure they were message girls or Holiness anyway walking down uh you know where the gates are in the The Concourse there at the airport and I and I looked at them and I looked at everybody else and I thought my you could see them in a crowd of a thousand people walking from a mile away yes because that's how they stood out right right but they stood out in a good way I looked and think they don't belong here I sat there and I think I don't belong here let me read you this quote brother random said this is a a questions and answers I don't have the question I don't know what the question was but it's in questions and answers 1964. if you go on a logo look at it it's uh 1062-8 I don't know what that means one zero six two dash eight I guess that's the page number maybe and and the Cod book uh I'm not sure but it's questions and answers 1964. he said I he said and I'd advise anybody never be a rolling stone that's just somebody who's always uproot and moving and everything never be a rolling stone see less it's some kind of ministry that calls you to be that way because he said I'd give I I'd just give anything this morning if I had a place here on Earth that I could go and say this is home amen I I would reiterate that for myself I mean I love my wife my children my grandchildren my family uh you know I I love you all I I enjoy living in Tucson still won't say love but I enjoy living in Tucson but there's there's just there's just just never been a home me and my wife were talking about it she even said yesterday she said I miss sometimes living around a lot of the greenery and you know you go over to a Greener but places got Greenery and I tell her I said well I miss you know having some water a body of water or something a big river or a ocean or something and we talk about that and as soon as you go to a place like that you're like oh man this is so humid goodness I hope and live here you think well maybe it wasn't so bad over there The Grass Is Always Greener but what it is this is just always there's just not that place brother Graham said I'd just give anything this morning if I had a place on Earth here that I could say this is home he said if I had it I'd give a million dollars this 1960 . so a million dollars and 64. today a million dollars is like a thousand and you know people millionaires or a diamond does anymore I happen not to be one of them and none of us are but millionaires are uh like the grass in a place that has grass which we don't really have here so that analogy doesn't work very well here but it's like the sand of the scene stars of the sky and millionaires are all over the place now brother Graham said I'd give a million dollars if I had it if I had a place that I could say boy I just love this so well I don't ever want to leave it no more amen I feel the same way much as I love you all and love being here and my family amen it be that way he said I'd leave it no more he said I'd give anything he said but I just I just can't find it I'm I'm something like Abraham was I'm looking for a city see I can't find it but I know it's there but I certainly can't get adjusted to any certain place on this Earth I just don't uh it just doesn't look like fine people find places you go here it's too wet you go there it's too dry you go up there it's too cold you go down there it's too hot you see there's no place it just ain't home and it's just not just like here but just like him just like Abraham just like we are today our vision still it's not of this world it's not of this Cosmos our vision is on something that's greater we're looking for that City in my heart my heart knows it it's there amen Abraham went looking for it Abraham desired to get there we do today that's our vision we want to go that's it that City this place is not our home am I amen we may settle a little bit we may have a home we may have the things that we have and loved ones and family and friends and church and all that we've got and God blesses us with but this place just in home amen I look and I I used to told you before I you know you all know I drove Uber Lyft and I would always have people ask me especially if they were out of town pick them up a hotel or something came to the airport how do you like living in Tucson I said well I'm not from Tucson I'm from North Carolina well which do you like better I said and six and one half does the other there's good bad see it there's goods and bads to here there's goods and bats and we lived in St Augustine there's good and bad to every place it just depends on I said it now if if you really have to live by a big body of water don't live in Tucson amen if you hate the humidity Tucson's a great place to live amen if you like you know beautiful weather nine months out of the year or two it's not in a good place last Friday we were up in Minnesota again Minneapolis the high I think was 45. wind was blowing spitting a little rain and cloudy it was cold uh we went downstairs that morning and we have our little breakfast and they have a couple of monitors up and they had the news over there local news and I looked over the weather comes on and on the on Friday this was like Wednesday or Thursday on Friday they had the word chili chili 45 is not chilly 45 is cold yes especially when the wind is up and the rain's coming it's cold not chilly but I guess to those people up there it's it's chilly I don't know if it's zero cold but this place is just not home right too cold too hot although I would rather work in the cold than the hot when I'm out in labor I'd rather it be cold than hot but it's just just not our home it wasn't Abraham's he went to the land God showed him but he's sojourning around like he's in a strange place and it belonged to him it belongs to us but We Were Strangers and we are we are but when it's all burned off and God gets rid of rid of Cosmos this world order God will set up his own kingdom here amen God will set up his own kingdom here and it'll be a kingdom of righteousness praise the Lord but keep in mind now Abraham went looking for that City whose Builder and maker was God you know the strange thing is found it and you didn't even know it Abraham founded and he didn't even know it not at the time and not until a prophet came for this day called William Branham did anybody know that Abraham found that amen let's read Genesis chapter 14. he found that City praise the Lord amen that City that bride is adorned for her husband yes coming together the meeting place look at Abraham Abram now as As We Know The Story Goes uh these Kings come in from the different cities towns and they come and they take over Sodom and Gomorrah they spoil the place but the worst mistake they made was they took block and his family as prisoners slaves doesn't say but they took lot and when they took lot they took Abraham's possession they could have took anything and saw them they wanted to and it wouldn't have mattered but a but lot belonged to Abraham and when lot when a man came and that was uh that came out alive that got out of that place and when told Abraham said Abraham this happened they got locked like Abraham looked he said God he said you told me to look north south east and west and wherever I go it's mine a lot is mine and I'm gonna go get him amen Lord is mine that's the worst mistake this Kings made was taking lot because then they got Abraham's possession lot belonged to Abraham and Abraham said he belongs to me and I'm gonna go get him everybody praise the Lord and he did now look at this triumphant Prophet let's start uh uh word Genesis 14. let's just start with verse 12. we'll kind of get in the middle of my my synopsis of the story here and they and again uh go go back recently realize yourself there's a lot more than what we're going to touch on today re-familiarize yourself with the story because when Abraham left home remember he took lot uh took his servants his uh his possessions cattle and everything and then lot in Abraham's herdsmen started uh conflicting and and getting into fights and uh they they were rubbing each other so uh Abraham said look it's it's not good for us to to have this contention he said lot you go look out wherever you want to go you just go but we need to separate and lot looked down and he saw the cities of Sodom and he decided to go down and Pitch his tit down there and that's where he was when Abraham got the word that lot had been captured by those kings that came in and spoiled Sodom and Gomorrah and took lot and his family and they took Lot 12 verse now Genesis 14 12. and they took a lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt and saw them and his goods and departed there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plane of memory the Amorite brother of eschalk and brother of Aynor and they and these were Confederate with Abraham they were joined together allies and when Abram heard that his brother was taken was then taken captive he armed and trained his uh he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided them against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hoba which is on the left hand uh left hand of Damascus and he brought back Abraham the Victorious Prophet now brought back um all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people so Abraham a rescued his possession he took back what belonged to him amen he didn't take anything more than what belonged to him he didn't take anything less but he took what belonged to him amen amen praise God it belongs to you you have a right to take it back and Satan has took it from you you have a right it belongs to you amen and he brought Abraham took them back and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of uh uh say dorlemer of the kings that were with him at the valley of Sheba which is the King's Dale and Melchizedek amen here we go now Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God now we all know that through a prophet of this day a Vindicated word Prophet William Branham told us that that Melchizedek was God in flesh formed that then later became Jesus Christ yes amen amen became in in that spirit in the body the Corporal body of Jesus Christ so when Abraham Abram met now kazadik he finally not realizing it but got a bodily form at least one of them of God there communing with him the the god of Heaven and Earth brought to his Victorious prophet communion praise the Lord they had communion just like we're going to have communion today yes they had communion Fellowship yes communion together conversing Fellowship we take the Lord's Supper based on of course the crust the crucifixion of Jesus Christ but Melchizedek himself God in in this bodily form brought wine and bread for him and Abraham to sit down and have communion together praise the Lord amen wonderful I believe he's meeting us here today too yes amen he's gonna he's here with us to do the same as he did here he met now Cassidy king of Salem king of Peace Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God go to you can go to Hebrews in several places and it refers to Melchizedek we had a little study on Melchizedek a year or so ago but it explains and tells us who this was that was meeting Abraham amen and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which had delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him Abraham Abram gave him Melchizedek tithes of all Abram paid Melchizedek God in bodily formed in Melchizedek ties of all that he possessed praise the Lord and the king of Sodom said unto Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself no no Abraham didn't go there to get rich Abraham didn't go there to get all the spoils of anybody any Nation any King he went there to gain back his possession and that was locked he got locked back that but the king of Sodom said now give me the persons and take all the goods you take all the spoils you won the battle you take all the spools and Abraham said to the king of Sodom I have lift up my hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take of a friend even to a shoe latcher and that will not take anything that is done lest thou should say I have made Abram rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which with uh went with me uh aynar escal and and mammary uh let them take their portion but Abraham went for one thing and that was his possession and when he went now look where they are when he went he met Melchizedek he milked he met God he met the one that was to later become as we know Jesus Christ amen the same God same spirit that came in a bodily Corporal body of Jesus Christ Abraham met him right there so God look now God sent Abraham away from his home remember there's always the end goal there's always a purpose and a reason why God tells us we might not understand it might not ever know why but there's always a reason yes there's always a purpose amen amen my flight's got all mixed up yesterday my bags weren't delivered so I don't know what time they get there last night yeah she I went to bed like I was tired uh they got my bike my Banks got to the house last night at 10 o'clock because all this stuff going on and it's so easy and I did I honestly you get rattled get upset and things aren't going right you're exhausted and tired and worked a hard 70 hour a week and you got four hours sleep the night before it just you know your flesh is weak that's when Satan wants to attack the most yes but there was a reason for it I don't know I sat on I ended up sitting in a middle seat which I have never done and absolutely hate I sat in a metal middle seat from Minneapolis to Dallas but I sat next to a guy that we didn't do nothing but talk the the entire flight and even after we got off the plane whatever will come of it I don't know why all that happened I don't know but there's a reason God Did It for a reason when your spirit gets settled down and you get to a place you think God whatever purpose and reason that was so be it unto me amen amen why have you did that I don't know we we got on the plane in Minneapolis and we pulled away from the gate in this you know they push you with those things and we started to turn it was a loud pop on the plane we turned around and sat there and and the captain we just sat there and sat there and the captains came on and said you may didn't realize the recognizing we just been sitting here a while a while but we heard that loud pop as you probably all heard and we don't know what that is I said then you can get me off this plane we're gonna turn around we're gonna go back to the gate and inspect it not a problem with me so they go back and it's wow this is going to take a while and it was it was 6 30 in the morning uh in Minneapolis and they came back and said well the mechanic said of abundance of caution we're just going to delay it and it was like two o'clock I think it actually finally left so I ended up getting on another plane going to Dallas it was just two gates over that left at 8 11. um and why I don't know why there was a pop you know it probably was absolutely nothing I'll never know if it was anything wrong with mechanically wrong with the plane but it doesn't matter there's a reason for it and as a as a child of God you recognize God may have purposely listen this is gonna this may sound a little arrogant friends but God will purposely disrupt 250 people's lives just because of you right amen just because he wants you at a certain place at a certain time with a certain person or whatever God will absolutely turn 250 people's lives upside down because they're all scrambling fortunately I had uh uh purchased first class I had you know a little upgrade so I got off the plane immediately uh when that happened and I was at the ticket gate first to get my arrangements but I'm I'm done with my arrangements and people in the back of a plane are still getting off I don't know what those people did there's no way they got on the plane I got on but God would have disrupted all those people's lives I don't know what they did where they went where they ended up I don't know but all those lives disrupted just because of me just because God wants me to do something whatever it was I don't know I mean you think that's crazy well God landed an entire plane for how long for brother Brown to go see a widow woman about her son yeah grounded that plan for we don't know how long and brother Rams going around saying well I'm sure I missed my plan I'm sure my plank they held the plane just for him right now they didn't hold it just for him they don't know that they held it just for him but they held it just for him because God said so yes you don't know why God does but God always has a reason yeah there's always an in-purpose and goal amen that God has in his mind and whatever he does with us there's always a reason there was a reason why God did this with Abraham there's a reason why God sent him out from everything he loved to go find a land that he may not have even known existed and when he got there he felt like a total stranger but yet God had him go had the herdsmen let's just make a synopsis here God had their herdsmen fight each other so that they could be separated so that lot would go down to Sodom and Gomorrah so that the Kings would come in and spoil Sodom and take lot just so Abraham would go down there and slaughter them and take lot back to himself so that he would meet Melchizedek amen Hallelujah explain that to me friends put some reasoning to that you can't do it it's just God's purpose and reason that he has for his children and God had there the reason that he sent him out from his dad and from his family and everything that was comfortable to it he was standing right there in the form of male president and Melchizedek brought him and had communion right there and Abraham paid him a tithe of all he had oh praise God friend you can't explain that it's just God it's just God working the work in his life Abraham when that was over was still sojourning and looking for that City till the day he died yes amen until we die or we Rapture I'm going to still be looking for that City hallelujah amen I just know that City that we have that's our possession we're still we're still sojourners here there is a place that God's got yes that that city is gonna come down on that pyramid-shaped Mountain that's pushed up out of this earth look at this future home revamp says now notice so the redeem shall walk in the light we see now we'll walk in the light of the beautiful light there's something in US calling out amen if it's not calling out friend you got to get a better experience with Christ they're set that something that's calling us out passed from Death to life because that's waiting see that's what the attribute what we feel truly this is he said now are you ready he's asking are you ready he said truly this is that City that Abraham was looking for praise God that City that he was looking for he met him and didn't even know it in the form of melchized that that City will be a literal City one day that'll be set up for us that City that Abraham was looking for see being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere the Bible said so and he forsook the city he lived in and went over and went to where he was exactly where he went is exactly where that City will be exactly where God and uh Abraham and Melchizedek had communion is exactly where that city is either mid-shaped mountain is going to push up from the earth that that city is going to come down on that very spot now it may not be geographically within that mile but that area Palestine Israel that that place is where that pyramid-shaped mountain is going to push up right there where he met he he was standing right there right where it's going to be having Fellowship communion with Melchizedek comedian right on that literal spot praise the Lord he may not have known it but we know it amen we know it very much that that that that that amount is not going to push up from here friend it's going to push up from where that promised land is amen we're the promised land that God has promised his children this whole time that's where that City will be amen this is the city that Abraham was looking for being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere the Bible says so he forsook the city he lived went over and looked where it went and where he went is exactly where it will be see he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God Jesus gone to prepare with Divine hands a Divine City a Divine architect for a Divine bottom people for a predestinated people he has gone to prepare it Abraham was looking for him he possessed uh professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose Builder maker was God that Prophet knowing it was somewhere John saw it coming down uh but Abraham thought it must be on the Earth right then why because he met Mel custody did not realizing that he is that City praise the Lord the king of it and he gave him tithe Abraham gave him tithe and had no father Melchizedek no father no mother had no beginning of day ending of Life Abraham met him and they took communion right on the little spot where the city will be raised up that Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live praise the Lord right on that very spot that you begin that place that we've been talking about that place that we are looking for that place that will be raised up for us to be able to see and to partake of our future home amen if you're listening to Future home yes future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride like I said it's about three and a half hours but friend it's so good to listen to yes amen that was something I encourage you to do a few weeks ago or when we started this and I'd still do it I'm gonna read one more quote uh we'll close here in just a moment we'll get ready for the communion service here amen who is this Melchizedek notice after the battle was over the battle Abraham Victorious over the Kings Melchizedek served his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself amen now we want to see here and type in the view of communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ and after the struggle is over of course symbolically we know after the struggle is over after you've done gone uh uh don't got yourself whipped out uh that's thens when you partake of Christ amen we sang that we've seen that song cleanse me Lord we examine ourselves we wrestle it out we battle it out we repent if necessary we repent to one another if necessary we make it right before we take that communion we battle it out we wrestle we Victorious over the devil and any little schisms and wedges that he tries to bring yeah yeah amen Even in our little church Even in our lives in some way or something that's got a grip you repent Lord forgive me you make it right you gotta battle it out first and when you become Victorious then you partake of the Lord's Supper yes amen act the battle is over then God gives you of himself that is his true communion little bread and wafer just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out become a part of God remember at this time the communion had never been instituted not until the death of Christ hundreds and hundreds of years later but Melchizedek after his child Abraham had won the victory Melchizedek met him and gave him one uh wine and bread showing that after the Earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again at the wedding supper yes praise the Lord Oh How It just fits so beautifully together yes amen How It just fits so perfectly how God still he's mindful of his children how he's mindful of his Gentile bride how it all comes in message uh meshes in the beauty that is God who else could write a script like that who else could play it out who else could have others live and play that out in his mind for him that's what we do Melchizedek went to meet Abraham before he got back home what a beautiful type amen Melchizedek meeting Abraham before he got back home after the battle we meet Jesus in the air before we go home and praise the Lord that's right II Thessalonians tells us we'll meet him in the air a beautiful type of Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field in the cool of the day you remember Rebecca and Isaac amen when Eliezer went out and found Rebecca and brought her unto Isaac before they could even get together she flies off the Campbell and they run together and they meet together can you imagine you imagine in today's world something like that happening could you imagine going and and someone like that bringing and you just you look a hundred yards away and there they are and all of a sudden a hundred yards away that's my wife that's my husband well who are there I have no idea but it's my wife what what are they what do they like are they compatible don't know don't care that's my wife amen they look alike sound alike come to the same place speak the same language uh each same Foods don't know don't care that's my wife that's my husband can you imagine that's exactly what they did before they even got home they come and run together go in the tent and they made their marriage uh official praise the Lord just like Christ in this bride yes amen but we know what he likes we know who he is we know how to please it because he's told us amen and we go and meet him in the air yes amen before we go to the other side before we end up at the marriage supper to take that communion again we meet him in the air yes praise the Lord so shall we ever be with the Lord amen amen thank God Abraham met him right there at that very spot that very spot where we will be with him Amen in that beautiful city praise the Lord I stand if we could the beautiful types of God's word is unfailing Saints it's beautiful incredible it's God in letter form none of us could have ever all the creativity of the world and all the things that Hollywood and stuff come and the imaginations and the story lines that people write never could have even began to touch the storyline God's written for his children amen I'm looking forward to it yes praise the Lord I'm looking forward to it I'm thankful that God give it to us he shows it to us you mean because we're a part of him amen praise the Lord Jesus you love him yes he praise the Lord now let's sing this course as we start to get ready for prepare our spirits our hearts for this sacred moment taking the Lord's Supper amen there's not as many as we had last time but that's okay too whoever's here and whoever feels and we'll uh partake of it and it's always been a very solemn and sacred service that that I've been a part of and the churches that I've pastored and it's always been that way here the Lord's supper and foot washing I don't expect this to be any different but now again as we've said we wrestle it out Saints amen that's why I felt to do this today I was studying this and the Lord put that on my heart again I thought we'd do communion in a couple weeks or something and the Lord just kept coming back as I was studying and going through this at my desk and do it today there's a reason amen there's a purpose reason why God wanted this for today and so who decided to come who was able to come who is here are going to be the ones that partake of this yes by his Divine promise and will yes amen so we believe that we battle this out now we made sure there's nothing in our hearts there's no impediments in our lives we don't have any ought against anybody else remember we've wrestled it out and our hearts and our minds are clear between us and the Lord yes yes amen praise the Lord so as we do that as we continue to examine Psalm number 16 I didn't put it I didn't even think to put it we might have it in sing this of course as we just just this first verse maybe one day we'll sing the whole song one day but just this first verse as you search and examine your hearts amen before we do this today let's sing today [Music] know my house I pray there [Music] somewhere [Music] in me and please [Music] foreign [Music] here there'll be [Music] something in me [Music] foreign [Music] believing now that we've wrestled it out with the Lord the hearts are clear our thoughts our minds amen our convenience service [Music] First Corinthians chapter 11 [Music] in Reading 23rd verse for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus same night in which he was betrayed to bread given thanks he break it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you to do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he ends up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty as off as you drink it in remembrance of me or as often as you eat of this bread drink of this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat the eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink of damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this calls many a weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye may come together unto con uh come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come [Music] the Lord said he blessed the bread blessed the wine and as he blessed he break it so we're going to pray over this and I'm going to to pray over this and I want you all in your heart as we pray together over this amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father we have here symbol the representation of your own body and blood that you shed and that was split open Lord for our Salvation Lord at Calvary through pilot and the scorching all that happened Lord and the Jews allowing this and crying let his blood be on us and our children Lord we look at this today and we recognize the sacrifice that was made because it was something that was taken from you it was something given to you but was taken from you Lord but you it wasn't taken in the sense that they took it but you laid it down freely and yes because you had the power and having that power comes character the character says that the greater purpose is others lord it's the same today for all of us Lord the greater purpose of Our Lives is to live our life for others yes yes you left you lived your life for others you gave your life for others and now we stand in a
