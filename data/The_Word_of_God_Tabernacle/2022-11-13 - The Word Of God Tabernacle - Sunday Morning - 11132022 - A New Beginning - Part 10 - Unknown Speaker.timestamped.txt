[29:03] don't drink live your life right makes a
[29:06] big difference and the grace of God of
[29:08] course
[29:09] oh remember that request I remember
[29:11] brother Anthony when I first started
[29:15] playing the drums at the Tabernacle back
[29:16] in the early 2000s and back in the back
[29:19] room and Anthony had his trumpet and
[29:21] he he was uh he was never short of words
[29:26] but he always had something good and
[29:27] positive to say yes and
[29:30] it was nice to know brother Anthony a
[29:31] little he passed we were up in the
[29:33] mountains so but it was good to know him
[29:35] that little time I did
[29:36] so remember that family anyone else my
[29:39] assist Patricia to come in with you
[29:43] I just had a praise report we'll do
[29:46] those after okay Mike has got one too so
[29:48] amen
[29:51] oh yeah I'm sorry I thought it was
[29:53] appraise you know uh not yet anyway
[29:57] um just what uh
[29:59] uh was it two weeks ago
[30:01] um I had a migraine here in church and I
[30:04] don't know what's going on other than
[30:06] just Satan hitting me uh some of you all
[30:10] right remember brother or sister Pat and
[30:12] maybe even sister Norma might have been
[30:14] in the service in the mountains when I
[30:16] was in high school
[30:17] and because I had a migraine almost
[30:19] every day and I got paid for it and they
[30:21] stopped
[30:22] for some reason the past five or so
[30:25] weeks every Monday I'll get one just on
[30:28] Monday I don't know why
[30:30] um and then but for some reason that
[30:32] Sunday I also had one that I had on the
[30:33] back
[30:35] I don't know what's Satan's doing or I
[30:39] think he's just not because I
[30:41] I always have the testimony that the
[30:44] lord always heals me enough that I can
[30:45] come to church amen am I post a duty so
[30:49] maybe he's just trying to keep me out of
[30:50] work now
[30:52] so y'all could just remember me in
[30:54] prayer
[30:55] yes praise the Lord remember me too I'll
[30:58] be flying out again this afternoon uh
[31:01] going back to Minneapolis
[31:03] Friday is supposed to be 10
[31:06] and for a low and 18 for a hot home and
[31:11] snow Monday Tuesday and Wednesday not
[31:14] huge snows but just you know half inch
[31:17] inch at a time or something but it's
[31:19] going to be pretty chilly so I
[31:20] appreciate your prayers of that it's not
[31:23] something we're normally used to here
[31:25] I've got plenty of warm stuff so it's
[31:27] not a huge deal and a lot of what we do
[31:29] is inside it's not necessarily heated
[31:32] but it's inside so it shouldn't be too
[31:35] bad but again I appreciate your prayers
[31:36] safe traveling also thank you for that
[31:39] anyone else real quick
[31:41] even unless I'll stand if we could have
[31:43] been
[31:44] in good seeds one of you that's come
[31:46] here today and been with us just that
[31:49] time of year seems like uh I don't know
[31:51] why it seems like when the weather
[31:53] changes and the temperature changes and
[31:55] uh just people just keep getting getting
[31:59] hit I still had this stuff in my chest I

[32:07] trying to cough out but it just don't
[32:09] want to come out but God has already
[32:11] touched me and healed
[32:13] Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads
[32:17] in unison of the faith and the love that
[32:20] you bestowed upon us yes Lord and we
[32:23] approach your throne of grace and mercy
[32:26] with faith and believing that your word
[32:30] will never fall short knowing that as
[32:34] you the Bible even says that you who
[32:38] cannot lie that whatever you promise to
[32:41] your children you will bring it to pass
[32:43] yes Lord and father we are living in
[32:47] such perilous times and and such uh late
[32:53] hour unless you speak to our hearts we
[32:56] are going to miss it oh we are going to
[32:59] be left behind yes even James who spoke
[33:03] so bluntly and so profoundly said he
[33:08] that keepeth the whole law that he had
[33:11] offended at one point he is guilty of
[33:14] all it is not what we can do even if the
[33:18] sisters grow their hair and they don't
[33:20] wear makeup and don't identify with the
[33:23] world if there's something in the word
[33:25] that they're not obeying father they'll
[33:29] keep keep us out in US Brothers Lord

[34:16] couple of days ago he says some people
[34:18] will refuse to read the Bible but it is
[34:22] up to us to be written Bibles amen

[37:37] really good amen and I was so happy
[37:40] I'm like I need prayer I really
[37:43] said I was the Lord I know it was for me
[37:46] amen amen
[37:49] well I don't know if you remember but
[37:51] two three people came up and we had
[37:53] prayer and I kept filling that press on
[37:55] my heart to keep
[37:57] pulling but after I pray for you and
[37:59] Grace that day it went away so God knows
[38:03] not that all of the prayers including
[38:06] myself get touched but
[38:08] amen
[38:09] God's touched God's good isn't he don't
[38:13] tell me Miracles aren't still happening
[38:15] amen just cause brother Brown's not here
[38:17] doesn't mean Miracles stop and I think
[38:20] they were so prominent with brother
[38:22] Brandon because they were all in one
[38:24] individual but now you hear them and and
[38:27] they happen and they happen here and
[38:28] they happen there and how many times in
[38:30] this church have we had Miracles my
[38:33] daughter couldn't carry her child if God
[38:34] had healed her of that autoimmune she
[38:37] wouldn't have the strength to do it God
[38:39] touched and healed her sister Julie each
[38:42] I mean we could just go on and on the
[38:45] Miracles in God and when you do this
[38:47] when you hear the doctor have to say
[38:49] there's nothing wrong with you when you
[38:52] hear a doctor say you've got a new
[38:54] muscle in your foot or new tendon like
[38:56] my wife when the medical field has to
[38:59] acknowledge something supernatural has
[39:01] taken place even though they don't
[39:03] understand it oh praise the Lord God's
[39:06] good amen God is so good
[39:18] amen bless and Lord
[39:22] amen God bless you uh this song was

[49:24] to come in in a second that's exactly
[49:26] what happened the scripture said I'm
[49:29] going to prayer place for you

[50:54] medicine
[50:55] amen they all knew about Father Brown is
[50:59] a minister
[51:01] actually
[51:02] my physical
[51:05] Ministry yeah I had asked the sisters to
[51:08] pray for me so that I could be a
[51:11] testimony good and everything was
[51:13] positive that they said and I just thank

[51:48] we're good
[51:50] amen I'm gonna go in the scripture
[51:53] Genesis chapter one
[51:58] we're going to start back Lord will
[52:00] where we left off last time
[52:02] we want to start getting into the
[52:04] Millennium I
[52:06] um
[52:07] uh last time I mentioned that uh one
[52:11] kind of sort of overlaps into the other
[52:13] and this will probably take a couple of
[52:15] services
[52:16] uh just afterward leads but the holidays
[52:19] coming up and everything happening and
[52:21] the you know time frames the way they
[52:24] work out you never know what the Lord's
[52:25] going to do and
[52:27] Thanksgiving and Christmas and so but um
[52:31] we'll just however he leads that's what
[52:33] we want to do but as I looked into
[52:37] continue to look you know as I kind of
[52:39] thought it would but
[52:40] um that it would probably take a couple
[52:43] of services really uh it's strange
[52:45] because
[52:47] um well we'll just we'll read the
[52:49] scripture and let you be seated in and
[52:51] there so uh Genesis chapter 1 verse one
[52:54] and two we're going to read as we do in
[52:56] this uh series we've been doing here on
[52:58] the new beginning this will be the new
[53:00] beginning part 10 so let's just buy our
[53:02] heads for word of prayer if we could
[53:05] word so thankful father again Lord of
[53:09] uh we could just read a scripture and
[53:12] close a book and go home Lord just of
[53:14] what you've done for us Lord the
[53:16] testimonies and the spirit and God just
[53:19] knowing you to be so real with us yes
[53:21] Lord we thank you so much and I I guess
[53:24] sometimes we get in the attitude of the
[53:27] spirit of thinking that there's got to
[53:28] be hundreds or thousands in a service to
[53:30] make a service Lord but as service is me
[53:33] and you yes it is that's a little group
[53:36] here Lord each one of us me and you us
[53:39] and you Lord we're here God to worship
[53:41] you to praise you and thank you God for
[53:43] so many things you've done for us Lord
[53:45] and the Miracles that you've done in our
[53:47] lives the healings the supernatural
[53:49] healings Lord and and miracles God that
[53:52] you've done for us Lord you never cease
[53:55] you're always with us Lord you promise
[53:57] to be you with us and God we give you
[54:00] thanks and praise Lord for this service
[54:02] for this time for each one that have
[54:04] come Lord and again for those who may be
[54:06] streaming just pray that your Holy
[54:08] Spirit would have the remaining power of
[54:10] this service Lord in the palm of your
[54:11] hand and do what you feel necessary
[54:13] speak to our hearts the word should have
[54:16] us to hear and help that word that it
[54:18] would draw us closer to you Lord and
[54:20] more like you more in your image father
[54:22] to become more like that word because
[54:24] that's who you marry Lord you marry the
[54:28] word because you are the word and the
[54:29] bride is the word and the word bride
[54:31] together we make a union of word we
[54:34] thank you Lord that we could be
[54:36] accounted as a part of that group lord
[54:38] it's a part of that uh uh that that
[54:41] Bride for this last day Lord we know the
[54:44] time is imminent we know we can see
[54:46] things around us taking place Lord but
[54:48] more than anything we feel that pulled
[54:50] and recognize there's something within
[54:52] our innermost being that's calling to us
[54:55] pulling us closer to you Lord drawing us
[54:59] into that place it's that image into
[55:01] that that that venue Lord that we're
[55:04] ready to go home to be with you looking
[55:06] for our loved ones our loved ones that
[55:07] have gone on to appear before first at
[55:10] any time Lord we just pray again take
[55:13] control of the remaining part of us or
[55:14] speak through these lips word should
[55:16] have us to hear anointed here as well
[55:17] Lord it'll be all glory honor and praise
[55:20] to you we commit it to you now in the
[55:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[55:24] amen amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in
[55:28] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[55:31] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[55:32] and void and darkness is upon the face
[55:35] of the deep the spirit of God moved upon
[55:37] the face of the waters you could be
[55:40] seated if you like
[55:42] thank you
[55:43] I mean as I was saying uh the Millennium
[55:46] is a very unusual thing because the
[55:48] actual word Millennium is kind of like
[55:50] the word rapture it does not show in the
[55:53] scripture uh the actual word Millennium
[55:55] is not in the scripture it's taken from
[55:58] a Thousand-Year period is a millennium
[56:00] and when it talks about a thousand year
[56:03] period in the in in Revelation we type
[56:07] that to uh Millennium just like we do
[56:10] when it talks about a catching away or a
[56:12] catch-up we talk about uh a Rapture
[56:15] being raptured or enraptured out of this
[56:18] world out of these bodies into a new
[56:20] life well the Millennium is a lot the
[56:22] same way but even unlike a Rapture uh
[56:25] there's very little spoken of
[56:27] scripturally about the Millennium a lot
[56:30] of things that have derived in the
[56:33] thought of a millennium is either in the
[56:35] scripture or is typed through the
[56:37] scripture in what is going to take place
[56:40] in the Millennium and a lot of what
[56:42] brother Branham talked about when it
[56:44] referred to the Millennium was as such
[56:46] it was something that brother random
[56:48] looked it was scriptural there or it was
[56:51] something that brother random looked as
[56:53] types and shadows and things to
[56:55] recognize to roll over to that place we
[56:58] spoke a little bit about Millennium we
[57:00] went through the feast days of the Jews
[57:02] and the Feast of the Tabernacles the
[57:05] trumpets Tabernacles and even into that
[57:08] eighth day which is actually even beyond
[57:10] the Millennium but include but the
[57:12] Millennium includes or encompasses a
[57:15] period of time uh and in in some ways
[57:18] and I probably will today maybe the next
[57:22] time we speak on this whenever that
[57:23] would be next service or whenever that
[57:26] it would Encompass uh some things that
[57:29] brother random said uh there are some
[57:32] things that brother random said in his
[57:34] early Ministry that he changed in his
[57:37] later Ministry about the Millennium uh
[57:40] and maybe the Lord willing will will get
[57:42] into some of those things maybe not
[57:45] but we can recognize a lot of the things
[57:49] that we see based on what the scripture
[57:51] says and of course an inspired prophet
[57:54] of God through the word of God to speak
[57:56] to us to help us understand what is
[57:58] about to take place now
[58:01] um you know
[58:03] politics and religion a lot of times
[58:06] fall hand in hand you got Kings and the
[58:10] elections and things and I won't get
[58:12] into the election but I will say that to
[58:15] me and what brother Dennis was uh uh was
[58:18] expounding on a little bit uh kind of
[58:21] spoke to me this week
[58:24] um this election it kind of made me
[58:26] believe in looking at it uh just for a
[58:29] minute that uh this country could get to
[58:35] it just about any place that it could
[58:37] get to and the people will still
[58:40] continue to allow the people that got it
[58:43] there to stay in power and it's baffling
[58:47] to me I don't understand it outside of
[58:49] the fact that we know what's going on we
[58:52] know the time we live we know what the
[58:54] scripture says and we know where we're
[58:56] headed uh and I'll just leave it at that
[58:58] but it sure helped me understand because
[59:01] you know it kind of goes back to uh
[59:05] Einstein actually I think it was
[59:07] Einstein uh I actually said this years
[59:09] ago and didn't even know Einstein said
[59:11] it uh just by inspiration Lord put it on
[59:14] my heart that people beat their head
[59:15] against the wall hoping to try to have a
[59:17] change in their life when they don't do
[59:19] anything different with their lives yeah
[59:21] you can't expect your life to change if
[59:23] you don't do anything different with
[59:25] your life if you want to change you got
[59:27] to make a change you got to be the
[59:29] change you got to change yourself so
[59:31] that things change in your life that's
[59:33] the only way change can come is that
[59:36] when a change takes place and uh for
[59:40] people to expect or to Hope but change
[59:42] to take place and do nothing about it or
[59:46] continue as we would say status quo to
[59:49] me is just unfathomable I I don't
[59:52] understand that if you want things to
[59:54] change you got to do something to make a
[59:57] change right if you don't do anything to
[1:00:00] make a change nothing's going to change
[1:00:02] uh hence the world that we live in today
[1:00:04] but I think God even if all this
[1:00:07] happening God will continue to take care
[1:00:09] of his children yes God will continue to
[1:00:11] bless us God will continue to provide
[1:00:13] for us God will continue to make a way
[1:00:15] for us even if we have to sit at the
[1:00:17] dinner table and speak that food into
[1:00:19] existence right God will still Make A
[1:00:22] Way always has always does is is
[1:00:25] righteous never forsaken nor his seed
[1:00:28] begging bread right he will take care of
[1:00:30] his own he always says has always will
[1:00:33] be now the last service that we spoke
[1:00:35] and I apologize for last week uh I got
[1:00:39] home and one of the first things I got
[1:00:41] in the car didn't even get home one of
[1:00:42] the first things I told my wife I don't
[1:00:44] think she wanted to hear it but I told
[1:00:46] her I said if this happens I'm not I'm
[1:00:48] quitting I'm not going to do that job if
[1:00:50] it interferes with church right I know
[1:00:53] the lord gave me that job and it was a
[1:00:55] fluke
[1:00:56] um
[1:00:57] and circumstances the way they worked
[1:00:59] out uh it'd take a long time to explain
[1:01:02] everything that happened and how
[1:01:05] everything devolved in that day but when
[1:01:07] I was in the middle of of
[1:01:10] basically scraping the bottom of the
[1:01:12] barrel to get here on Saturday night
[1:01:14] Sonia my wife text me uh in the middle
[1:01:17] of all this and said these people are
[1:01:19] gone these people aren't feeling well
[1:01:21] this is going to be just a few people
[1:01:22] this hadn't yelling I thought okay I'm
[1:01:24] gonna quit fighting this so hard and I'm
[1:01:26] just gonna let the Lord do whatever he's
[1:01:28] doing right and just allow this to
[1:01:30] happen and I scheduled a flight to come
[1:01:33] in on Sunday instead of trying to kill
[1:01:36] myself and
[1:01:37] do whatever everything to get it every
[1:01:42] single turn
[1:01:44] um and you know how subtle the Lord is
[1:01:46] and how he guides us and leads us he
[1:01:48] doesn't Force us right but when you get
[1:01:51] to a certain place you think okay and
[1:01:53] then the door slammed and you get over
[1:01:54] to another place and the door slams you
[1:01:56] think okay these doors aren't slamming
[1:01:58] by coincidence something's going on here
[1:02:00] if you're a child of God you recognize
[1:02:02] something else is going on yes right so
[1:02:05] but anyway that being said I do I
[1:02:08] apologize for uh the service last week
[1:02:11] it it grates on me hard I feel like I
[1:02:14] hadn't been Church in months uh I hate
[1:02:17] that feeling but uh I'm glad you're here
[1:02:19] today the Lord bless you apologize for
[1:02:22] that the Lord whatever whatever weight
[1:02:24] of time or eternity proves out why that
[1:02:27] happened last week I I don't know
[1:02:29] whatever it is then uh to him be all the
[1:02:32] glory so but when we hear last time we
[1:02:35] spoke on Armageddon we basically mostly
[1:02:38] hit the highlights didn't delve into it
[1:02:40] too deeply but to move on from uh the
[1:02:43] Armageddon uh we recognize we enter into
[1:02:46] the place of the Millennium after
[1:02:49] Armageddon the Millennium sets in after
[1:02:52] Armageddon so let's go back to the
[1:02:54] scripture again and re-reference what we
[1:02:57] spoke about last time just for a
[1:02:59] refresher for a few minutes
[1:03:01] um I'm not so as much pressed for time
[1:03:03] today I got a little bit more time I
[1:03:05] don't have to rush out too fast this
[1:03:07] afternoon
[1:03:08] but let's go back to Revelation chapter
[1:03:11] 19.
[1:03:17] um and let's let's uh let's start back
[1:03:20] there where we left off as we
[1:03:21] transitioned from Armageddon to the
[1:03:24] millennium
[1:03:25] I want to read a few extra scriptures
[1:03:27] that we didn't read last time as well so
[1:03:29] uh that'll help us bring us into that
[1:03:33] place so Revelation chapter 19 let's
[1:03:35] just start um
[1:03:37] let's start with verse five and a voice
[1:03:39] came out of the throne saying praise our
[1:03:43] God all ye his Saints and ye that fear
[1:03:45] Him both great and small and I heard as
[1:03:47] it were the voice of great multitude as
[1:03:50] the voice of many Waters the voice of a
[1:03:52] mighty thundering saying Alleluia for
[1:03:55] the Lord God omnipotent reigning let us
[1:03:58] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:04:00] him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:04:02] come and his wife hath made herself
[1:04:05] ready no longer bride but wife has made
[1:04:09] herself ready amen
[1:04:12] and to her was because this is another
[1:04:14] time period this is another time frame
[1:04:17] we'll talk about this in a minute how
[1:04:19] the transitions of time and and spaces
[1:04:22] of time
[1:04:24] God transitions you see in the scripture
[1:04:26] and this is one of those transitions uh
[1:04:29] just like in natural life when a when a
[1:04:32] a couple uh
[1:04:34] transition from uh just a mere
[1:04:38] relationship to an engagement to uh to a
[1:04:42] wedding to a wedding uh to a a wedding
[1:04:46] supper uh reception to a marriage uh
[1:04:49] from being a bride to a wife that's a
[1:04:52] transition that takes place because this
[1:04:54] is a different period of time we've
[1:04:56] moved into
[1:04:57] and eighth verse now and to her and
[1:04:59] we'll talk about that in another light
[1:05:01] even with Christ and just uh Lord will
[1:05:03] if we have time today and to her was
[1:05:06] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:05:07] Finland and clean and white for the fine
[1:05:10] linen is the righteousness of the Saints
[1:05:13] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:05:17] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:05:19] supper of the lamb praise the Lord the
[1:05:21] marriage supper of the Lamb we know
[1:05:23] that's just for the bride amen it's the
[1:05:27] marriage supper of the lamb now remember
[1:05:30] Jews are not a part of the marriage
[1:05:33] supper because it's the marriage supper
[1:05:35] of the Lamb they are there they were his
[1:05:37] they were Jehovah's wife we're talking
[1:05:39] about uh Jesus bride now and the
[1:05:43] marriage supper of the lamb at this time
[1:05:46] the Jews have yet to recognize even
[1:05:49] their Messiah as him being Jesus Christ
[1:05:52] or the Lamb of God okay so this is just
[1:05:55] for the Gentile bride the Rapture that
[1:05:58] takes place for the Gentile goes to that
[1:06:00] marriage supper of the lamb and he saith
[1:06:02] unto me these are the true sayings of
[1:06:05] God
[1:06:06] amen and I for maybe I shouldn't say to
[1:06:09] you I feel checked about that not
[1:06:10] necessarily not Jews but those who
[1:06:13] accepted Christ as their savior it could
[1:06:15] have been Jew but accepted Christ as
[1:06:18] their savior so uh I hope for some
[1:06:21] reason I felt checked to say that so
[1:06:22] it's it's uh it's also it's all those
[1:06:26] that receive Jesus Christ as their
[1:06:28] Savior and Lord right so and I fell on
[1:06:31] his feet to worship him and he said unto
[1:06:34] me see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:06:36] servant and and of thy Brethren that
[1:06:39] have the testimony of Jesus worship God
[1:06:43] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[1:06:46] of Prophecy
[1:06:47] and I saw heaven open amen now we've
[1:06:51] gotten
[1:06:52] toward to the to after the uh after the
[1:06:56] Rapture after the marriage supper the
[1:06:58] reception we've gotten to a place now at
[1:07:01] the end of that remember the end of the
[1:07:04] end of Armageddon the end of the three
[1:07:06] and a half years the time that the Jews
[1:07:09] the the spirit of God goes back to the
[1:07:12] Jews the time that the Jews recognized
[1:07:15] their Messiah and that uh that Gathering
[1:07:18] Place that they've come to they
[1:07:20] recognize their Messiah all of this
[1:07:22] accumulates the end of Armageddon the
[1:07:25] end of tribulation all this accumulates
[1:07:27] at the end here it all gathers together
[1:07:30] just as it says from the four corners of
[1:07:33] the earth it all it all comes together
[1:07:35] to a head here
[1:07:36] and I saw heaven open and behold a white
[1:07:39] horse and he that sat on him was called
[1:07:42] faithful and true and in righteousness
[1:07:45] he does judge and make war in contrast
[1:07:48] to Revelation 6 who who the writer of
[1:07:52] that white horse is Satan in his
[1:07:55] deceptive hypocrisy amen
[1:07:58] which is
[1:08:00] transitions from White Horse to Red
[1:08:02] Horse to Black Horse to Pale Horse
[1:08:04] amen remember say all satan does is to
[1:08:08] uh impersonate God
[1:08:11] everything he does he himself
[1:08:14] transitions see
[1:08:17] Jesus now this way or truth faithful and
[1:08:20] true in righteousness he does judgment
[1:08:21] War his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:08:24] on his head were many crowns and he had
[1:08:26] a name written that no man knew but he
[1:08:28] himself remember that name brother
[1:08:30] brother green talked about that brother
[1:08:32] Brandon mentioned said that he would
[1:08:35] never tell him see something that was
[1:08:38] never that would never be mentioned now
[1:08:40] and brother greens took that to the
[1:08:42] Grave with him so brother Brown did
[1:08:44] amen but we'll know we'll know one day
[1:08:46] yes amen and he was clothed with a
[1:08:50] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[1:08:52] called is called the word of God it
[1:08:54] isn't the word of God but it's called
[1:08:56] the word of God and the armies which are
[1:08:58] in heaven followed him upon white horses
[1:09:01] that is us
[1:09:03] out from that marriage supper now
[1:09:04] following him upon white horses uh the
[1:09:09] Purity Holiness and power that is behind
[1:09:13] uh the saints of God behind him and with
[1:09:17] him remember
[1:09:19] um and we may have time to get to this
[1:09:22] today but remember when when uh when
[1:09:25] Peter spoke up
[1:09:26] and Jesus exhorted him and said blessed
[1:09:31] art thou Simon by John for flesh and
[1:09:33] brothers not revealed but my father in
[1:09:34] Heaven's room and Upon This Rock the
[1:09:37] Revelation I'll build my church hello
[1:09:39] that's you and me the bride of Christ
[1:09:41] built upon the Revelation who Jesus is
[1:09:43] and to thee I give the keys to
[1:09:46] Kingston of Heaven whatever you loose on
[1:09:48] earth is
[1:09:50] loot Down in Heaven what is that that is
[1:09:51] the power and authority that God has
[1:09:53] given by his uh uh by his word and will
[1:09:57] to not just Peter but to those that were
[1:10:01] built upon that Revelation Jesus Christ
[1:10:04] The Bride of Jesus Christ now she has
[1:10:08] that he comes out on the White Horse
[1:10:10] what is that that's the Holiness and
[1:10:13] purity of white on the power the the
[1:10:16] power of that horse Amen to each one of
[1:10:18] those horses the horse in the scripture
[1:10:20] represents a power amen and each one of
[1:10:24] the Bride now is on one of those horses
[1:10:27] with that power speak it's a key amen
[1:10:32] that's what I want to get to a little
[1:10:34] bit later it's that key
[1:10:37] amen so let's move on
[1:10:41] um
[1:10:42] and he was closed with investor dipped
[1:10:44] in Blood and his name is called the word
[1:10:46] of God the armies which are in heaven
[1:10:49] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:10:52] in fine linen white and clean but we can
[1:10:54] find out who that is because we just
[1:10:56] read it over here in the eighth verse
[1:10:58] and to her was granted that she should
[1:11:01] be arrayed in fine linen clean white and
[1:11:03] clean
[1:11:04] amen that's her that's Us Praise the
[1:11:06] Lord and out of his mouth
[1:11:09] goeth a sharp sword that with it he
[1:11:13] should Smite the Nations and he shall
[1:11:16] rule them with a rod of iron and he
[1:11:18] treaded The Wine Press of the fiereness
[1:11:21] fierceness and the wrath of almighty God
[1:11:23] and he hath on his Vester and on his
[1:11:26] thigh name written king of kings and
[1:11:30] Lord of lords now I want to explore just
[1:11:32] for a moment that as we talked about in
[1:11:36] Fairly good detail last time about the
[1:11:39] sword the uh out of his mouth goeth a
[1:11:43] sharp sword now we know that the sword
[1:11:45] is the word of God yes amen but and and
[1:11:48] there's several places that it talks
[1:11:50] about that
[1:11:51] um uh Isaiah chapter 1 is one of those
[1:11:55] places let me see if I can find it real
[1:11:57] quick Isaiah 1 20 says this but if you
[1:12:00] refuse and rebel
[1:12:02] ye shall be devoured
[1:12:05] with the sword
[1:12:07] amen you shall be devoured with the
[1:12:09] sword for the mouth of the Lord has
[1:12:12] spoken
[1:12:13] let's go to another one second
[1:12:15] Thessalonians 2 8. look at this now
[1:12:17] second Thessalonians 2 8 says this and
[1:12:20] then shall that Wicked Satan be revealed
[1:12:24] which we know he has remember the
[1:12:27] purpose of the opening of the seals was
[1:12:29] what
[1:12:30] amen are one of the purposes there's
[1:12:33] multi-purposes to the opening of the
[1:12:35] seals but what was the one what I
[1:12:37] consider the one main purpose that the
[1:12:40] seals were ministered preached revealed
[1:12:43] it was to expose Satan yes you looked
[1:12:46] through and everything uh that that is
[1:12:49] in those seals that was contrary to even
[1:12:53] how brother Brown preached it the first
[1:12:55] time where he preached the first time
[1:12:57] the white red black and Pale Horse was
[1:13:00] Christ
[1:13:01] you look in Larkin you see they uh you
[1:13:04] you go talk to the nominational people
[1:13:06] if they know anything about the the
[1:13:08] seals they'll tell you that's Jesus
[1:13:10] Christ simply because it was a white
[1:13:12] horse right they'll tell they'll believe
[1:13:15] that's Jesus Christ but it's not and we
[1:13:17] know it's not it's safe it's safe
[1:13:19] continuing to follow the trail of the
[1:13:22] serpent the trail that Jesus God cursed
[1:13:27] Satan in the beginning
[1:13:28] when God cursed Satan he said the dust
[1:13:32] you will eat and your uh you will bruise
[1:13:35] the heel of the woman's seed Jesus
[1:13:38] Christ and he continues to do that as
[1:13:41] Satan continues to stay on the heel of
[1:13:44] God perverting as much as he can of what
[1:13:47] God does and trying to duplicate or
[1:13:50] replicate or uh
[1:13:53] make a facsimile of what God does
[1:13:56] he he tricks people by the deception of
[1:14:00] that and to those who could be deceived
[1:14:03] will be deceived but he was exposed
[1:14:06] in this day the wicked has been revealed
[1:14:10] we know his tricks we know his devices
[1:14:14] we know what he does we know how he
[1:14:16] doesn't why he does it we know
[1:14:18] everything about it Satan has been fully
[1:14:21] exposed in this last day through a
[1:14:24] seventh angel messenger Prophet that
[1:14:27] brought a word of God to a bride to show
[1:14:29] her where she is and what she's dealing
[1:14:32] with amen we know who he is now amen
[1:14:35] he's been fully exposed he's been
[1:14:38] unveiled
[1:14:40] now look that Wicked is revealed whom
[1:14:44] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:14:48] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:14:52] brightness of his coming
[1:14:54] amen with the spirit of his mouth what
[1:14:58] is that well that's the word we just
[1:15:01] spoke about the word of God that come
[1:15:04] forth does God speak anything other than
[1:15:08] his word
[1:15:09] right well that kind of is a paradox
[1:15:13] because when he speaks it is his word
[1:15:16] when he speaks it is the word of God
[1:15:20] when I speak if I speak of my own accord
[1:15:23] it's the words of Newton
[1:15:26] it's no disputing it how dumb or
[1:15:28] ridiculous it may be sometimes is still
[1:15:30] the word of mutant but God's word is
[1:15:33] perfect it's Eternal and when he speaks
[1:15:35] it is the word of God how could he do
[1:15:37] anything less he can't how can she his
[1:15:40] bride who has become the word do
[1:15:42] anything else as well right when he
[1:15:45] speaks it's the word so what is coming
[1:15:47] out of his mouth the spirit of his mouth
[1:15:49] Revelation 19 is the word
[1:15:53] he destroys he consumes with the spirit
[1:15:57] of his mouth and shall destroy now look
[1:15:59] at that word destroyed if you go and
[1:16:02] look at the word destroyed it does not
[1:16:04] mean annihilate
[1:16:06] it does not mean to do away with it
[1:16:08] needs to render idle
[1:16:11] that's one of the definitions of this
[1:16:13] when you look destroy not annihilate it
[1:16:16] means to render one Idol to make that
[1:16:19] person
[1:16:20] incapable of moving
[1:16:23] of of doing what they normally would do
[1:16:26] they'd become idle based on the power
[1:16:29] The Authority the that that that is
[1:16:32] given that is projected towards this
[1:16:35] individual or the word of God does that
[1:16:37] to Satan
[1:16:39] it renders him completely incapable of
[1:16:42] doing what he always has done
[1:16:45] he's idle he can't do it anymore we'll
[1:16:48] look at that in just a second but now as
[1:16:50] that word that consumes him come out of
[1:16:54] the mouth of God the shark sword verse
[1:16:57] 15 Revelation 19 15 out of his mouth
[1:17:00] that sharp sword
[1:17:03] a man that comes forward it's smiting
[1:17:05] the Nations and of course he even talks
[1:17:08] about over in the new Heavens when he
[1:17:09] talks about ruling with a rod of iron
[1:17:12] he goes from the smity from the
[1:17:15] controlling to bringing them over into
[1:17:17] ruling with a rod of iron in the new the
[1:17:19] in the new city
[1:17:21] outside the city if you will
[1:17:23] you will so it's a it's even speaking of
[1:17:25] that time and a later time a time to
[1:17:28] come we know this scripture does that
[1:17:30] many times twofold threefold meaning
[1:17:32] sometimes that the Lord gives us in his
[1:17:35] scripture that that speaks that to us
[1:17:37] amen now let's continue on we keep that
[1:17:40] in mind
[1:17:42] as we continue verse 17 and I saw an
[1:17:45] angel standing in the Sun
[1:17:49] and he cried with a loud voice saying to
[1:17:51] all the fowls that fly in the midst of
[1:17:54] Heaven Come and gather yourself together
[1:17:57] to the supper of the great God
[1:18:02] that they may eat the Flesh of Kings and
[1:18:05] the Flesh of captains and the Flesh of
[1:18:08] Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and
[1:18:11] of them that set on them and the Flesh
[1:18:13] of all men though free and bombo small
[1:18:16] and great
[1:18:17] and I saw the Beast and the kings of the
[1:18:20] earth and their armies gathered together
[1:18:22] to make war against him that set on the
[1:18:24] horse and against his army against us
[1:18:27] even as that word comes out of his mouth
[1:18:30] they gathered together Satan gathering
[1:18:34] together their Armageddon all of his to
[1:18:36] bring them together to make war against
[1:18:38] him that settled the horse Christ and
[1:18:41] his army us
[1:18:44] and the Beast was taken and with him the
[1:18:47] false prophet that wrought Miracles
[1:18:49] before him
[1:18:50] uh with which he deceived them that had
[1:18:54] received the mark of the beast and them
[1:18:55] that worshiped His image these boats
[1:18:59] were cast alive into the Lake of Fire
[1:19:01] Burning with Brimstone but not yet this
[1:19:04] is also speaking in reference to
[1:19:06] something that's going to happen right
[1:19:09] amen he gathers them together and he
[1:19:12] brings him to this place and he renders
[1:19:14] him idle and takes control over them for
[1:19:16] the purpose of after the white Throne
[1:19:19] judgment remember God does not send
[1:19:22] anybody to a fiery hell until first
[1:19:26] they've gone through a judgment not even
[1:19:28] Satan right he has to go through this
[1:19:31] judgment just like everybody else does
[1:19:33] all the Angels he has to Lucifer he has
[1:19:36] to be judged just like the rest of them
[1:19:38] it hasn't come at this point and we'll
[1:19:40] continue on the reading and as we
[1:19:42] continue in this
[1:19:43] um
[1:19:44] uh this series uh we'll get to that
[1:19:47] point
[1:19:48] but what he's talking about now is
[1:19:51] taking control over the Beast which is
[1:19:55] an office and we know it's controlled by
[1:19:57] Satan but the Beast is in office we know
[1:20:00] Revelation 17 he was was not was was not
[1:20:04] is is not uh and continues one dies the
[1:20:07] next takes his place dies takes place
[1:20:09] retires takes his place and we know what
[1:20:11] that office is see so that Beast is in
[1:20:14] office and it was taken with the false
[1:20:17] prophet that wrought Miracles and
[1:20:19] deceived many people
[1:20:22] now let's look to the 21st verse and the
[1:20:24] remnant uh were slain with the sword of
[1:20:27] him that set upon the horse those that
[1:20:29] were left
[1:20:30] uh which sword proceeded out of his
[1:20:32] mouth and all the fouls were filled with
[1:20:35] their flesh now notice something that
[1:20:37] when these the the call to the foul to
[1:20:41] come was to come and to Feast off of the
[1:20:45] Flesh of all those that had fallen in
[1:20:49] their death at this time of Armageddon
[1:20:51] again blood to the horse's bridle it'll
[1:20:54] be a it will be and for those who feel
[1:20:57] like they don't mind being a foolish
[1:20:58] virgin God help you it will be a
[1:21:01] bloodbath amen it will be a merciless
[1:21:05] bloodbath amen it won't just be amen it
[1:21:10] won't just be Christ his bride and them
[1:21:14] making War but there are Wars with each
[1:21:17] other yet still to take place remember
[1:21:20] through this time is also the Gentile
[1:21:23] that have to be purged the foolish
[1:21:25] virgin that go through the tribulation
[1:21:27] that have to be purged they have to give
[1:21:29] their lives for their testimony and seal
[1:21:31] their testimony with their own blood
[1:21:33] they are murdered they are killed the
[1:21:35] Jews themselves as well amen notice it's
[1:21:39] not just Christ and the the hymn and the
[1:21:43] White Horse and those that are armies
[1:21:45] that come and slaughtered they will also
[1:21:47] Slaughter each other
[1:21:49] I mean look look at this nation let's
[1:21:52] just take this for an example look at
[1:21:54] this nation real quick
[1:21:56] this nation is probably as divided as I
[1:21:59] think I've ever seen in my life
[1:22:01] and
[1:22:02] one of the wholesale ideas that is
[1:22:06] prominent in this mess in this uh
[1:22:09] country is is a turn towards a hatred to
[1:22:14] a true Christian
[1:22:16] now a religion is also under assault the
[1:22:20] Christian religion is uh I I thought it
[1:22:23] was uh
[1:22:26] pointing it the appropriate Tabitha sin
[1:22:30] or I saw that she had posted something
[1:22:32] of this girl that said when I was a
[1:22:34] Buddhist everybody loved me when I was a
[1:22:37] uh he didn't do everybody loved me when
[1:22:39] I worshiped rocks everybody loved me
[1:22:41] when I did this everybody loved me I was
[1:22:44] miserable but everybody everybody
[1:22:45] encouraged me and loved me and and I
[1:22:48] forgot all it's just uh burning candles
[1:22:50] and worshiping rocks and I forgot all
[1:22:53] the things that she had listed that she
[1:22:54] had done to wickery and demonic spirits
[1:22:57] and devils and everybody encouraged her
[1:22:59] and and gave her High Hopes And and
[1:23:02] tried to increase her and bring her
[1:23:06] through and then all of a sudden she
[1:23:07] found Jesus Christ
[1:23:09] she found the way the truth to life she
[1:23:11] surrendered herself and sold her out
[1:23:13] self out to it and now they call her a
[1:23:15] radical
[1:23:17] oh you're crazy you've lost your mind
[1:23:19] you're a radical
[1:23:22] they were okay when she was a Buddhist
[1:23:24] they were okay when she was doing all
[1:23:25] this worshiping rocks and burning
[1:23:27] candles and and and being a witch and
[1:23:30] they were okay with all that stuff but
[1:23:32] as soon as she turned to Jesus Christ
[1:23:34] they hated her for it right it just
[1:23:37] shows you the attitude and that was
[1:23:38] actually uh strategy enough that
[1:23:41] that's not an allegory that's an actual
[1:23:44] story that is an actual person's life
[1:23:46] that printed it or put it out for people
[1:23:49] to read and as soon as she became a
[1:23:51] Christian oh you're radical now you're a
[1:23:53] fanatic just because she became a
[1:23:56] Christian
[1:23:57] but you see how divided it is
[1:24:01] I wouldn't say so but I imagine there's
[1:24:04] probably a good group of people if they
[1:24:06] could just destroy or wipe out the other
[1:24:08] group of people that do it they get rid
[1:24:10] of them in a heartbeat yeah
[1:24:12] amen you already hear us up there
[1:24:14] locking people up for what what are they
[1:24:17] they're imprisoned and what did they do
[1:24:19] get they were getting a sandwich at
[1:24:20] Hardee's what did they do wrong
[1:24:22] it's it's it's become to that place see
[1:24:25] so it's not just Jesus the bride is
[1:24:29] going to be a wholesale because see
[1:24:31] remember the spirit of God is gone
[1:24:33] when the bride leaves the spirit of God
[1:24:36] is gone when the spirit of God is gone
[1:24:38] there's no more love there's no more
[1:24:40] peace there's no more forgiveness
[1:24:42] there's nothing of the good attributes
[1:24:46] of the spirit of God that's left here
[1:24:47] it'll be nothing but judgment hatred
[1:24:50] mean angry vile it's getting to that
[1:24:53] place now but when the bride leaves
[1:24:56] it'll take full force and you can see
[1:24:58] what this is going to happen it's going
[1:25:01] to be a literal bloodbath and an
[1:25:03] invitation for the fowls to come the
[1:25:06] Kings the rich men the people in power
[1:25:09] they are all going to be laid dead in
[1:25:12] these fouls come and feast off of their
[1:25:14] bodies
[1:25:15] now what does that tell you because
[1:25:17] notice this is just as the Millennium
[1:25:20] begins to set in because Christ has come
[1:25:23] and he's brought his bride with him with
[1:25:26] him and she's there with him amen the
[1:25:28] Millennium is about to be set up
[1:25:32] but as this Millennium is about to be
[1:25:34] set up what has happened in the Earth
[1:25:35] the Armageddon has killed all those off
[1:25:39] and has uh carved out a place God has
[1:25:44] to have his bride
[1:25:46] and and his 144 000 and the Jew there in
[1:25:51] the Millennium in the time of a perfect
[1:25:54] place
[1:25:55] of a 1 000 year rate now let's go over
[1:25:59] to let's continue reading in the 20th
[1:26:01] chapter
[1:26:06] because I will tell you the the
[1:26:08] Millennium is not just for the bride the
[1:26:11] Millennium is for the bride and the 144
[1:26:13] 000 and for the Jew
[1:26:15] and we'll get to that in just a minute
[1:26:17] but let's read here Revelation 20 verse
[1:26:20] 1 and I saw an angel come down from
[1:26:22] heaven having the key of the bottomless
[1:26:25] pit and a chain in his hand
[1:26:29] he has a key
[1:26:31] now he doesn't have a car key he doesn't
[1:26:35] have a key like you would have to unlock
[1:26:38] the door
[1:26:39] it's not a key like this even though uh
[1:26:42] you look in our world today look at this
[1:26:44] country we're getting we're getting
[1:26:47] further and further away from these
[1:26:50] um I don't have it on me but my wife
[1:26:52] probably does now now to unlock or start
[1:26:55] our car you just got a little mechanism
[1:26:57] no key
[1:26:59] you push a button and the car starts you
[1:27:02] push the thing on the it's called a fob
[1:27:04] thing on open the trunk open the door
[1:27:06] snow key
[1:27:08] but there's something in there that's
[1:27:10] that
[1:27:12] makes it a key it's not a physical key
[1:27:16] that you unlock but it's an ability it's
[1:27:19] a knowledge it's an authority or power
[1:27:21] amen this key is an authority it's a
[1:27:24] power it's not a literal key that you
[1:27:26] unlock I went uh last time in
[1:27:29] Minneapolis uh we the last night at the
[1:27:32] whole at the airport we stayed in the
[1:27:34] hotel and I didn't want to get in the
[1:27:35] line of people so I just uh I got the
[1:27:37] app I checked in online and they give
[1:27:39] you a digital key yeah
[1:27:41] I checked in online I went right by the
[1:27:44] right by the front desk I went up the
[1:27:47] elevator to my door shook my phone and
[1:27:49] unlocked my door
[1:27:52] identity didn't need a key amen didn't
[1:27:56] need didn't even need a card
[1:27:58] didn't need anything like that it just
[1:28:01] transferred that authority to open that
[1:28:04] door through them to me
[1:28:07] and I was given the authority through my
[1:28:10] phone to open that door and to walk in
[1:28:14] crazy first time I'd ever done it
[1:28:17] but it's it's getting more and more of
[1:28:20] that place you don't even need a key but
[1:28:22] the but the point of the key is it's a
[1:28:25] point of authority
[1:28:26] it goes back to the point I tried to
[1:28:28] make earlier when Jesus gave Peter hence
[1:28:32] the bride the ability to call the shops
[1:28:37] if you will whatever you buying on Earth
[1:28:39] is found in heaven whatever you loose on
[1:28:41] Earth is loose in heaven see that's an
[1:28:43] authority that's a key I give to you the
[1:28:46] key if the key is an authority the angel
[1:28:50] come down
[1:28:51] from heaven with the key with the
[1:28:54] authority
[1:28:55] amen with control
[1:28:57] of the bottomless pit and a great chain
[1:29:00] in his hand now we know that brother
[1:29:02] Madam told us that that chain was not a
[1:29:05] logging chain
[1:29:06] but it was a chain of circumstance just
[1:29:09] like the key was not a literal key it
[1:29:12] was an authority this chain is not a
[1:29:16] literal chain it is it is a a
[1:29:19] circumstance
[1:29:21] it is a it is a linking of abilities to
[1:29:26] shut one out right or to render them
[1:29:29] listen
[1:29:31] if you listen to me earlier to render
[1:29:34] them idle right
[1:29:37] if you have a literal chain you can
[1:29:40] change somebody up handcuffs or zip ties
[1:29:43] or something or if you have a chain you
[1:29:44] can wrap you can render somebody
[1:29:46] physically idle
[1:29:48] you can render them idle this chain of
[1:29:51] circumstance renders through the word
[1:29:54] this man this this serpent this devil
[1:29:58] Idol
[1:29:59] he is incapable at this point
[1:30:03] through the authority given to seal him
[1:30:06] away to where he has no ability no one
[1:30:10] to be able to work on he has no way to
[1:30:14] hinder to buff it or to hurt anyone and
[1:30:19] at millennial
[1:30:21] amen he's bound
[1:30:23] praise God let's read it through and I
[1:30:26] saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:30:27] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[1:30:31] a great chain in his hand
[1:30:34] and he laid a hole on the dragon that
[1:30:37] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[1:30:39] and bound him a thousand years
[1:30:42] he didn't bind him like this he bound
[1:30:44] him and said uh
[1:30:47] remember what happened to job
[1:30:49] amen last service yes what happened to
[1:30:53] Satan
[1:30:54] Satan was incapable of getting the joke
[1:30:57] why because God hadn't bound amen God
[1:31:01] had him sealed out from being able to
[1:31:04] touch job or anything he had praise the
[1:31:07] Lord his family his property his animals
[1:31:09] his children nobody he couldn't touch
[1:31:12] him he was sealed yes
[1:31:14] even when God oh listen this now see
[1:31:18] even when God is so perfect and why he
[1:31:21] does things because I'm telling you
[1:31:23] stuff I didn't even know yesterday
[1:31:25] but when when God allowed Satan
[1:31:30] to get to job
[1:31:32] he stopped Satan by just allowing him to
[1:31:36] touch the stuff that job had
[1:31:38] amen even though Satan was allowed to
[1:31:41] touch his family to touch his his
[1:31:44] servants to touch his buildings to touch
[1:31:46] his animals God said don't you lay a
[1:31:49] hand on job
[1:31:51] let's see
[1:31:53] he rendered Satan Idol from being able
[1:31:56] to do the thing that Satan really wanted
[1:31:59] to do and that was Destroy job he wanted
[1:32:02] to get rid of job just as much as he
[1:32:04] wants to get rid of each of you
[1:32:06] amen or shall I say he wants to get rid
[1:32:09] of you as much as he wanted to get rid
[1:32:11] of job
[1:32:12] he wanted to destroy him but God said no
[1:32:15] don't touch him amen praise God so you
[1:32:19] notice when people and and me as a kid
[1:32:23] always envisioned that there's this
[1:32:27] great pit that doesn't have a bottom and
[1:32:30] this Angel throws Satan and
[1:32:33] closes the lid and seals this great
[1:32:36] chain thing and okay you can't come out
[1:32:38] of there it's not like that at all
[1:32:41] Satan's still Satan friend even through
[1:32:43] the millennium
[1:32:45] the devil's still the Devil he's just
[1:32:47] been he's just been rendered idle
[1:32:50] the mouth of the word the of the Lord
[1:32:53] has spoken it right and that brightness
[1:32:56] of his coming destroys renders Satan
[1:32:59] powerless
[1:33:01] in the Millennium Satan will be
[1:33:04] powerless
[1:33:05] now brother random says he'll have no
[1:33:08] subjects to work in
[1:33:11] there's something I want to go through
[1:33:12] the Millennium with you because there's
[1:33:14] several caveats to it a lot of questions
[1:33:17] asked one brother Bama really that I
[1:33:21] could ever find never was able to answer
[1:33:23] and I can't either
[1:33:25] but the question came
[1:33:28] excuse me from several people will there
[1:33:31] be children born in the millennium
[1:33:32] because we'll we go back we probably
[1:33:34] will eventually read in Isaiah and
[1:33:37] Ezekiel where it talks about the
[1:33:38] Millennium period and they'll be
[1:33:39] planning and they'll either the vineyard
[1:33:41] they'll build a house and they'll live
[1:33:43] in their house and another won't take it
[1:33:44] and another one inhabit it and and all
[1:33:47] the things happen in Millennium and it
[1:33:48] was asked brother random with children
[1:33:50] be born in the Millennium he says one
[1:33:52] place it really looks like they will
[1:33:53] another place it really doesn't
[1:33:55] he said to be honest with you all and to
[1:33:58] let you all know the truth that coming
[1:34:00] from from me right now he said I don't
[1:34:02] know
[1:34:03] and I respect that as much as I respect
[1:34:06] every perfect scriptural entry every day
[1:34:09] if you don't know you don't know yeah
[1:34:12] and the truth is there's a lot of things
[1:34:14] I don't know and I'll be perfectly
[1:34:16] honest with you I give you my opinion
[1:34:18] sometimes on things that may have been
[1:34:20] sitting out there and my opinion is uh I
[1:34:23] think there will be not
[1:34:25] I think they'll be at the original
[1:34:27] creation but that's just my opinion but
[1:34:30] brother Brown says he looks like in some
[1:34:33] places it could now what's he talking
[1:34:34] about he's talking about scriptural
[1:34:36] precedent
[1:34:37] their scriptural precedent that would
[1:34:39] lead you to believe that in the
[1:34:41] Millennium there will be children born
[1:34:44] but there's also other scriptural
[1:34:46] precedent that would lead you to believe
[1:34:48] that there won't be children morning he
[1:34:49] said but I don't know so there's things
[1:34:51] still there that we just don't know
[1:34:54] amen there's things that we don't
[1:34:56] understand we don't know and that's okay
[1:34:58] we'll take it as it comes I just want to
[1:35:01] be there that's that's that's what it
[1:35:03] mainly boils down to I just want to be
[1:35:05] there but now Satan is Bound for a
[1:35:09] thousand years how is he bound he's
[1:35:10] bound because there's no one in the
[1:35:13] Millennium that period that place that
[1:35:15] time for him to work in amen but there's
[1:35:18] got to come something later let's
[1:35:21] continue to read
[1:35:22] cast him into the bottomless pit shut
[1:35:25] him up set a seal upon him that he
[1:35:27] should deceive the Nations no more till
[1:35:29] the Thousand Years should be fulfilled
[1:35:31] and after that he must be loose for a
[1:35:34] little season
[1:35:37] that's getting into the end of what I
[1:35:40] want to discuss about the millennium
[1:35:43] because that starts getting us into Gog
[1:35:46] and Magog and uh
[1:35:50] something I didn't understand for a long
[1:35:52] time and that is my understanding of the
[1:35:56] millennium my understanding originally
[1:36:00] as a young Christian was the Millennium
[1:36:02] was going to be like the new Heavens or
[1:36:04] it's going to be like the the new city
[1:36:07] it was just uh time and ended and all
[1:36:10] this and of course is God unfolds that
[1:36:13] we see what God's done and you know
[1:36:15] brother Branham said places that the
[1:36:18] Earth will burn and we'll walk out on
[1:36:19] the ashes of the wicked in the
[1:36:20] Millennium well that's not true the
[1:36:23] Earth doesn't burn over till after the
[1:36:25] millennium amen and if you go in the
[1:36:28] scripture
[1:36:30] now I know it says it will burn like an
[1:36:32] oven but it doesn't say when it doesn't
[1:36:34] say exactly says a great and Dreadful
[1:36:36] day of the Lord Malachi that it will
[1:36:38] burn itself and it will but look at the
[1:36:41] scriptural reference when it talks about
[1:36:43] Armageddon it doesn't talk about a
[1:36:46] burning it talks about fouls coming and
[1:36:50] consuming people dead people's bodies
[1:36:53] not burning
[1:36:55] well if you burn everything often into
[1:36:57] the atmospheres explode how what is
[1:37:00] there for the birds to eat
[1:37:02] so if you look at scripturally amen and
[1:37:06] and
[1:37:07] come to what the Bible says about it it
[1:37:10] really it really opens up to make a lot
[1:37:12] of sense
[1:37:13] but you have to I had to lose my old
[1:37:18] ideas and thoughts of how it was going
[1:37:19] to be
[1:37:20] I I had to I had to completely forget
[1:37:23] because I would be sitting and studying
[1:37:26] and saying well how's this and this
[1:37:28] going to happen see but if I just forgot
[1:37:30] about it and went with a blank slate and
[1:37:32] said God just show me how it unfolds and
[1:37:35] read the Scripture it really just makes
[1:37:37] perfect sense
[1:37:39] but see when you get something fixed in
[1:37:41] your mind and you think this is how it's
[1:37:43] going to be but this but you don't line
[1:37:45] it up with the scripture you say well
[1:37:47] then I just need to forget what I
[1:37:49] thought about it before
[1:37:50] I just need to forget what my idea was
[1:37:52] about it before because it was all wrong
[1:37:55] now what does the Bible say about it
[1:37:58] amen this is what the word says about it
[1:38:00] as Christ and his bride come
[1:38:03] after Armageddon is over the
[1:38:06] Birds Feast off the foul the fouls Feast
[1:38:09] off the bodies of the people God set
[1:38:11] says sets up his Millennium Kingdom
[1:38:13] right here
[1:38:15] now as my last thing
[1:38:18] today it will be a time period of peace
[1:38:23] be a time period of sanctification it
[1:38:25] won't it will be a time period that is
[1:38:28] void of sin there will be no sin in the
[1:38:31] millennium
[1:38:32] there will be no sin at the place where
[1:38:35] God's bride will be resident
[1:38:38] no sin but there will be sin after the
[1:38:42] millennium
[1:38:43] recognize Satan the word says that he
[1:38:47] has to be loosed for a little season
[1:38:49] after the Millennium is over amen after
[1:38:52] the Millennium is over and after the
[1:38:55] millennium's over at the end of the
[1:38:56] Millennium when it's over we'll try to
[1:38:59] cover next time but there's one more
[1:39:00] thing again before I want that I wanted
[1:39:02] to get to you before we close here today
[1:39:04] and that is the fact that this is not
[1:39:06] just even as Christ and his bride will
[1:39:08] be here and set that Kingdom up
[1:39:12] the 144 000 Jews will be in there as
[1:39:16] well they will be a part of that
[1:39:19] Millennium now the one thing that really
[1:39:22] senses it is
[1:39:25] that when Christ how many knows that
[1:39:28] Christ came in three three different
[1:39:30] names three different uh he was Son of
[1:39:33] God Son of Man son of David amen now
[1:39:37] when Jesus was here in bodily Corporal
[1:39:39] bodily form he was son of man prophet
[1:39:43] when he went away the Holy Spirit came
[1:39:45] back Son of God but in the Millennium he
[1:39:48] will be son of David now I know I'm
[1:39:50] going over that very quickly but uh but
[1:39:54] my point to get to is that in the
[1:39:56] Millennium he will be the son of David
[1:39:58] now let's look at a scripture
[1:40:01] uh again as I close First Kings
[1:40:05] chapter one
[1:40:09] First Kings chapter one there's a
[1:40:12] promise of God to his people
[1:40:14] remember the Jew is still his people
[1:40:17] they're still his people amen he says
[1:40:21] uh look as high as you can look as far
[1:40:23] as you can
[1:40:25] you see the end nope never could I
[1:40:27] forget my people amen they're always
[1:40:29] just people there but there had to come
[1:40:31] a time of
[1:40:33] uh Gabriel's six-fold Vision that we
[1:40:37] went through there had to be that time
[1:40:39] for the Jews that they come to a
[1:40:41] Reconciliation
[1:40:43] now First Kings the promise of God
[1:40:46] chapter 1 verse 30.
[1:40:50] God said even as I swear unto thee by
[1:40:53] the Lord God of Israel saying assuredly
[1:40:57] Solomon thy son shall reign after me and
[1:41:02] he shall sit upon my throne in my stead
[1:41:06] even so I will certainly do this day now
[1:41:10] look
[1:41:11] Solomon did sit on the throne of David
[1:41:14] right absolutely as the son of David
[1:41:17] you say that's a fulfillment of that
[1:41:20] scripture in part
[1:41:22] but this scripture has a dual purpose as
[1:41:24] a dual meaning
[1:41:26] not only is Solomon the son of of David
[1:41:29] he is the natural son of David but what
[1:41:32] about the spiritual son of David
[1:41:35] Jesus Christ is the spiritual son of
[1:41:37] David
[1:41:39] let me read you here this is it brother
[1:41:41] random
[1:41:42] if he talks about Solomon uh the time of
[1:41:45] Solomon being basically a millennium
[1:41:47] time for the Jews in that time no Wars
[1:41:50] everything was great they had
[1:41:52] discernment uh Solomon judged well with
[1:41:54] the people he had God give Solomon favor
[1:41:57] obviously uh gave him wealth and riches
[1:42:01] and uh wisdom to judge's people
[1:42:05] but now he says now we all know that age
[1:42:08] let me jump down here now how that
[1:42:11] Hebrews standing there ought to
[1:42:12] recognize that Solomon had a gift of
[1:42:14] discernment he could discern the
[1:42:16] thoughts in their hearts and all rallied
[1:42:18] around Solomon and yet here stood a
[1:42:21] greater than Solomon
[1:42:23] amen a greater than Solomon brother Ram
[1:42:25] talk about that man that come and uh
[1:42:27] talk to Jesus or give him the message
[1:42:29] and didn't realize he's talking to the
[1:42:31] god of Heaven and Earth
[1:42:33] amen and went off and left just like he
[1:42:35] said that Hebrew standard he should have
[1:42:37] recognized that scene but he said they
[1:42:39] all rallied around some and yet there
[1:42:41] stood a greater than Solomon and Solomon
[1:42:44] was the son of David but he was the
[1:42:47] Lesser son of David by the flesh Jesus
[1:42:51] was the son of David by the seed of
[1:42:55] promise that Royal seed Jesus being the
[1:42:59] Royal seed of David of Abraham David was
[1:43:03] was that Royal seed that promised that
[1:43:06] spiritual see that he would set on the
[1:43:09] throne of David a word us he said on the
[1:43:11] throne of David in the Millennium right
[1:43:14] in the Millennium and we know that those
[1:43:17] 144 000 Jews will be there and Jesus
[1:43:21] will be there because they finally
[1:43:23] recognize their Messiah they finally
[1:43:26] recognized it with Jesus they finally
[1:43:27] recognized uh uh him as being their
[1:43:31] savior
[1:43:32] and and and they are the ones that make
[1:43:35] it into that that Millennium that period
[1:43:37] of time as Jesus sitting on the throne
[1:43:40] of David as he promised he would as the
[1:43:43] Royal seed or son of David amen he will
[1:43:47] be there sitting on that Throne that's
[1:43:49] the son of David
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:52] now the millennium
[1:43:56] is a rest period
[1:43:58] it's a
[1:44:01] it's a time of
[1:44:04] breaking the curse
[1:44:07] of the original sin
[1:44:10] uh it's a time where
[1:44:13] we have peace we we don't have the
[1:44:18] buffeting of Satan and
[1:44:21] all the
[1:44:23] spirits and Devils we have to put up
[1:44:25] with every day amen they will be
[1:44:27] rendered idle Amen in the Millennium now
[1:44:30] the next thing I want to get to is when
[1:44:33] we when we start getting to that end of
[1:44:35] that thousand year period
[1:44:36] uh we'll probably get more into the
[1:44:40] Millennium a little bit like I said
[1:44:42] we'll probably read a couple of
[1:44:43] scriptures in Isaiah Ezekiel that talk
[1:44:45] about uh the Millennium what the
[1:44:47] Millennium is is is is more or less like
[1:44:51] and where it goes after that point amen
[1:44:55] because we get to that point now that
[1:44:57] we've read through in the scripture
[1:44:58] where where Satan is loosed for a
[1:45:01] thousand years
[1:45:02] now I'll tell you because somebody gave
[1:45:05] it to me I probably wouldn't have
[1:45:07] otherwise but
[1:45:09] um somebody gave me the movie 2012. I
[1:45:11] think
[1:45:13] I think I recommend it there's some
[1:45:15] language in it that
[1:45:16] uh if you want to bleep it out or
[1:45:18] something that's up to you but I
[1:45:19] wouldn't recommend it on the pulpit here
[1:45:21] but I have seen it and it has two things
[1:45:25] in it uh and again I'm not I'm not
[1:45:29] saying you go watch it but
[1:45:31] I will tell you has two things in it
[1:45:33] that that actually inspired me one of
[1:45:35] them was uh it shows the sliding of LA
[1:45:38] from California into the ocean just like
[1:45:41] brother Branham said it would slide into
[1:45:43] the ocean it's actually sliding into the
[1:45:45] ocean
[1:45:46] the other thing was I always wondered
[1:45:49] because after Satan is loosed and we'll
[1:45:51] talk about this at length next time uh
[1:45:53] that after the Millennium then Satan's
[1:45:56] loosed
[1:45:57] who are these people that come up from
[1:45:59] the breadth of the earth
[1:46:01] that surround the city that surround the
[1:46:04] place the Millennium for us is taking
[1:46:06] place who are all these people
[1:46:09] and then I saw that at the end of that
[1:46:12] movie it gave me an inspiration because
[1:46:15] in that movie unlike the scripture the
[1:46:18] world is basically destroyed by water
[1:46:20] they built these arcs that
[1:46:24] a few thousand people whatever it was
[1:46:26] was in those arcs that eight that were
[1:46:30] able to survive the clanity that went on
[1:46:33] of as they considered it Armageddon
[1:46:37] or this flooding of the earth which
[1:46:39] again is unscriptural
[1:46:41] but they were able to survive it and
[1:46:43] live through it and come out on the
[1:46:44] other side and I thought my you know
[1:46:47] God is doing this
[1:46:50] but there's going to be people outside
[1:46:53] of the millennium
[1:46:54] that are on the breadths of the Earth
[1:46:57] this big planet this big rock we live on
[1:47:00] that are that are there that actually at
[1:47:03] the end of the Thousand Years and Satan
[1:47:05] is loosed and able to work his work on
[1:47:07] those people they start to come up and
[1:47:10] they want to come and make war again on
[1:47:12] on those that are in the millennium and
[1:47:15] of course then God bring fire and
[1:47:16] brimstone down in in
[1:47:18] the Earth gets burned over
[1:47:20] which we'll get into but it it gave some
[1:47:24] insight to me to to believe that at that
[1:47:28] point there was a way there there was a
[1:47:33] way for people to be able to
[1:47:35] survive Armageddon if you will to live
[1:47:39] on the breasts of the earth as this time
[1:47:41] period goes on but Satan is bound
[1:47:43] remember he can't work
[1:47:45] and but when he's loosed then it all
[1:47:48] Breaks Loose again if you will uh but
[1:47:51] again that's for another service so but
[1:47:54] I'm I
[1:47:58] um anxiously awaiting
[1:48:00] the marriage suffer the Rapture the
[1:48:02] marriage supper uh the Millennium
[1:48:05] however we may have or have not got some
[1:48:08] wrong or right uh through the scripture
[1:48:11] uh
[1:48:13] still going to be that wonderful time of
[1:48:15] peace for the bride amen praise the Lord
[1:48:17] let's stand if we could
[1:48:26] amen God's given us that promise of his
[1:48:30] word
[1:48:31] that he's blessed us to be able to be
[1:48:34] there be at that time yeah to be in
[1:48:37] in his
[1:48:39] in his City yes
[1:48:42] perfect
[1:48:43] holy righteous A Thousand Years really
[1:48:47] for the bride just like in the Garden of
[1:48:49] Eden and you know
[1:48:52] they had the Garden of Eden there and
[1:48:54] there was a whole rest of the world
[1:48:57] that was that was there
[1:49:00] people in it obviously but there was the
[1:49:02] Garden of Eden that they lived in for
[1:49:05] whatever period of time before the fall
[1:49:07] they lived in that Garden of Eden well
[1:49:10] that's the bride's going to live in that
[1:49:11] Millennium whatever it is wherever I
[1:49:13] believe it'll be in that same place
[1:49:15] where the city comes up there and
[1:49:17] Palestine that area but it'll be that
[1:49:19] time where she lives there a thousand
[1:49:21] years even plants and builds and but
[1:49:25] it'll be
[1:49:26] a time of Peace could you imagine you
[1:49:29] think I don't want to do any work well
[1:49:30] just think for a minute how much easier
[1:49:33] would work be in a theophany body
[1:49:36] without the without the uh the buffeting
[1:49:40] of Satan in his head and the Devils all
[1:49:44] the time coming how much easier is is
[1:49:46] life going to be yes uh even at that
[1:49:49] even at that time yes amen is going to
[1:49:53] be it's going to be uh it's gonna be a
[1:49:55] wonderful

[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:13] name amen God bless you pray something
[1:52:15] was said
[1:52:17] today again remember the request the
[1:52:19] prayer we had
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:22] um my flight leaves about 2 30ish I
[1:52:24] think it's supposed to so appreciate
[1:52:26] your prayers for that and through the
[1:52:28] week
[1:52:29] also I wanted to ask I know there's just
[1:52:33] a small contingency of us here this
[1:52:34] morning but I wanted to ask Christmas
[1:52:37] Day is on Sunday
[1:52:39] and I want to see if if uh and you don't
[1:52:43] have to raise your hand or give input
[1:52:44] but I would I wanted to put it out if
[1:52:48] everyone still wanted to have service uh
[1:52:51] if you're going to be with your families
[1:52:52] or
[1:52:53] or what you think you would like to do
[1:52:56] obviously
[1:52:59] um
[1:53:00] service is fine with me of course I have
[1:53:03] a service that matter if it's Christmas
[1:53:04] Day or not but if uh if you're gonna if
[1:53:07] most people are
[1:53:09] all is going to be with their families
[1:53:11] or something like that then we could
[1:53:13] just cancel that service but I wanted to
[1:53:15] leave it if it's something that uh is a
[1:53:17] thought to you just give it some thought
[1:53:19] uh let me know uh if you still want to
[1:53:23] have service we'll have service uh if
[1:53:25] everybody's going to be otherwise
[1:53:28] occupied that's fine too but I just
[1:53:30] wanted to put it out there and ask so
[1:53:33] you can let me know when you get a
[1:53:34] chance and we'll go accordingly there
[1:53:36] the other thing is came on my heart
[1:53:39] yesterday I wanted to try and have
[1:53:42] another dinner
[1:53:44] uh if we could I'm not exactly sure of
[1:53:48] any of the
[1:53:50] parameters or where or when I'd like to
[1:53:55] do it kind of between Thanksgiving and
[1:53:57] Christmas if we could which kind of puts
[1:53:59] it on
[1:54:01] I think the December 4th maybe and or
[1:54:04] the 20th something like that uh the
[1:54:08] Sundays that I'll be home it'll be here
[1:54:09] after after service is over I think it's
[1:54:13] December 4th of the 18th fourth and 18th
[1:54:17] so
[1:54:19] if you have any ideas you have any
[1:54:21] thoughts uh we came up with something
[1:54:23] last time I hope everybody enjoyed we
[1:54:26] went to uh Golden Corral but if you'd
[1:54:29] like to have something that we want to
[1:54:31] do here I know these people moved out of
[1:54:35] the place behind us I don't know I don't
[1:54:38] know if it's even large enough
[1:54:39] I'm not sure we could all go to a
[1:54:41] restaurant again
[1:54:43] if y'all would like to do that that's
[1:54:44] fine but I'd like to get your thoughts
[1:54:47] going with that as well so if you have
[1:54:49] any thoughts towards that any opinions
[1:54:52] um any thing that comes to mind that you
[1:54:55] think might work then let me know I'd
[1:54:58] really like to do it whether
[1:55:01] whether it's just going to Golden Corral
[1:55:03] or something again or a different
[1:55:05] restaurant or whatever
[1:55:07] that we can do so it's just something
[1:55:10] that came on my heart again this weekend
[1:55:11] that I thought about then it's just I
[1:55:14] think it's actually been almost a year
[1:55:15] since we've done it we used to do it two
[1:55:17] or three times a year and I've just been
[1:55:18] negligent I guess maybe because of the
[1:55:21] inability to have the space like we used
[1:55:23] to to have it uh the other thing I
[1:55:27] wanted to mention is
[1:55:29] um I was looking at a larger space
[1:55:32] to maybe move to I'm not sure
[1:55:36] but just give that some prayer and
[1:55:38] thought to whatever the Lord's will
[1:55:40] would be on that it's over on Ruth Roth
[1:55:42] so
[1:55:45] I I know a lot of people don't care but
[1:55:47] I do that I really the thing that itches
[1:55:51] me about it is being so close to North
[1:55:53] Side and again I know a lot of people
[1:55:55] probably don't care anything about that
[1:55:57] you know those churches don't throw us
[1:55:58] from each other in the city but that's
[1:56:00] not the way I like to do so I
[1:56:05] so anyway but I have been looking so uh
[1:56:09] not that I necessarily want to move or
[1:56:10] we have to move from here but uh it's
[1:56:13] just been something on my heart
[1:56:16] could have a lot more just twice the
[1:56:17] size of here twice the money but it's
[1:56:20] twice the size of here so uh if it's
[1:56:23] something that works and we can do it
[1:56:25] then
[1:56:26] um
[1:56:27] we'll see so again just something else I
[1:56:30] like for you to think about pray over
[1:56:31] and uh we'll just see where the Lord
[1:56:33] leads itself
[1:56:36] so Lord bless you think about those
[1:56:39] things I appreciate everybody's input uh
[1:56:42] I I'm not the church we are this is our
[1:56:46] church and your opinion and thoughts and
[1:56:50] all about it is as important as anybody
[1:56:52] else's so I want to let you know so let
[1:56:55] me know I appreciate it and we'll see
[1:56:57] what we do from there so
[1:57:00] love the Lord amen God is good to us
[1:57:04] isn't he so we'll just continue uh
[1:57:07] see where the Lord leads us from here
[1:57:09] yeah amen praise the Lord so God rests
[1:57:12] the fish and again I want to reiterate
[1:57:14] nothing's changed here I'm not doing
[1:57:16] that I'm just uh I'm just doing it to
[1:57:19] see if there's anything else maybe the
[1:57:21] Lord's trying to do or lead that I don't
[1:57:24] want to miss anything and if he's
[1:57:26] opening something changing something
[1:57:27] moving I want I just want to move with
[1:57:30] him so he's Craig's not kicking us out
[1:57:33] there's nothing the rent's not going up
[1:57:35] there's none of that has changed here so
[1:57:38] don't worry about that but
[1:57:40] um
[1:57:41] uh and so I just wanted to let you know
[1:57:43] that so amen amen I'd really like to
[1:57:47] have a little place not a rental uh that
[1:57:50] we can get and a building actually but
[1:57:53] anyway so whatever the Lord I you know
[1:57:56] we're so close to the end may not ever
[1:57:58] get there but if the Lord's opening
[1:58:01] something I want to be vigilant to it so
[1:58:05] so appreciate each one of you God is
[1:58:07] good amen amen remember to pray for
[1:58:10] everyone pray for a bride worldwide
