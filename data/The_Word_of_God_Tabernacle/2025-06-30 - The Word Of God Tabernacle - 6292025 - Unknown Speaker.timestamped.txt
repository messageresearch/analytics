[28:08] a freak thing happened at his
[28:09] apartments. Uh some gardener was
[28:11] trimming some trees, I guess, and busted
[28:14] a hornets's nest. So, they still got
[28:16] hornets all over the place, and it was
[28:18] advised that their apartment complex
[28:20] recommended to stay indoors. Yes. Uh, so
[28:24] that's kind of a tough situation. Don't
[28:26] want to get stung by Hornet. They are

[28:32] trust that he's got food and things to
[28:35] sustain and not have to worry about
[28:38] leaving or having somebody come in. So,
[28:41] just pray that the Lord would help him
[28:42] and get rid of these, have them find
[28:45] another home or something. Also got a
[28:47] text from Shereai this morning and said
[28:49] that they were ready to come to church.
[28:51] uh and getting ready to come and Gabriel

[29:12] brother Frank uh this past week. Yes.
[29:16] Come out. Uh someone told me yesterday
[29:18] had a massive heart attack. Amen. So he

[29:26] preached at several I don't even know
[29:29] what they call dascese uh church just
[29:31] church okay uh around town. So he was
[29:35] very well known and and loved from what

[30:01] please remember them in prayer. I
[30:02] appreciate your prayers this last week.
[30:04] I could still use your prayers though.
[30:06] Uh from the time that I got to the
[30:08] airport last Sunday till I landed this
[30:13] yesterday morning and Sonia picked me up
[30:15] or I was actually was I logged 90 hours
[30:18] on my on my phone. Uh 90 90 hours of
[30:23] being clocked in. Uh from the time I got
[30:26] to the airport last week to the time I
[30:28] got to the airport yesterday morning or
[30:30] yesterday afternoon was n right at 90
[30:32] hours. 90 a little over 90 hours. uh put
[30:36] about 70
[30:39] oh I don't know 70 70 70 some hours in
[30:42] this past week of actual work on the job
[30:44] site. Uh so I'm I'm I'm a little tired.
[30:46] I think my longest our longest day was
[30:48] 16 hours. Our shortest was 14 and a half
[30:51] hours. So it was a long grueling week.
[30:55] Uh we didn't make our deadline. We were
[30:57] supposed to have the place open Friday
[30:58] morning. Uh but everybody was working so
[31:03] hard to get it all done. But it was done
[31:05] before we left. They weren't quite
[31:07] washing cars yet, but it was all done
[31:09] when we left late Friday night. Uh, but
[31:12] I appreciate your prayers for that. My
[31:13] fingers are still I told Sonia this
[31:15] morning, my fingers swell up all the
[31:17] time when I when I do especially
[31:20] specific jobs, I can't even move my
[31:21] ring. Usually under normal conditions, I
[31:24] can take it off still, but I can't even
[31:27] move it this morning. Uh, so I
[31:29] appreciate your prayers. Uh, please pray
[31:32] for Joel also this morning. Uh he's
[31:34] going to have his uh drum recital this
[31:37] afternoon at 4:00 at the Guitar Center
[31:39] on Broadway. Anybody wants to go, you're
[31:41] obviously always welcome to go. Uh 4:00
[31:44] this afternoon, the Guitar Center on
[31:46] Broadway. Uh and he's not as nervous as
[31:49] he used to be. Uh but I know he still
[31:51] appreciates our prayers. So if you'd
[31:53] pray for him that I see Sister Julie's
[31:56] not here and Sister Karen and them still
[31:59] in the mountains, the pads. Um
[32:03] I see brother Steve and sister Anna this
[32:05] morning as well and also I'm sorry
[32:08] sister I just my also was for sister
[32:11] Lydia and also uh I was kind of
[32:16] kind of saving her for last actually I I
[32:19] don't know if that's good or bad but I
[32:21] knew it was going to take a little
[32:22] lengthier time to explain her situation
[32:24] but sister Lydia uh is in a great
[32:27] condition physically the doctors have
[32:29] given her up uh the cancer is coming
[32:32] back uh she couldn't eat, couldn't get
[32:34] her strength back, but the cancer they
[32:36] say is the doctors say the cancer has
[32:39] come back and there's nothing they can
[32:41] do and she's in such a depleted physical
[32:43] condition, they don't want to give her
[32:46] chemo or radiation or anything anymore.
[32:49] Uh so uh when medicine is finished, when
[32:54] doctors are finished, when science is
[32:56] finished, and they've all of the world's
[32:59] smartest men have given up, it's God's
[33:02] time. Amen. It's God's time. So my
[33:06] prayer for Sister Lydia, now it's God's
[33:09] time. And I pray that God is going to
[33:12] show to the rest of that family the
[33:15] thing that Sister Lydia has always
[33:17] wanted that they're going to see that
[33:19] God is real. That God is alive. God's
[33:22] going to touch Sister uh Sister Lydia. I
[33:25] believe in prayer that we're going to
[33:27] believe together that the Lord's going
[33:28] to touch Sister Lydia. And without a
[33:30] touch of the Lord, she won't be here
[33:32] very long. Uh she's at home. She's at
[33:35] she's in an at home hospice care. Uh, so
[33:40] please remember her in prayer. Lord,
[33:43] would you just touch her? Amen. I give
[33:45] you my testimony. That's what I believe.
[33:47] Amen. I want us to try to believe
[33:49] together for that. Amen. Praise the
[33:51] Lord. She's a precious sister and she
[33:53] held she held strong and she held true
[33:56] and she was faithful and um I believe
[33:59] she is still. So please remember her in
[34:02] prayer if you would. Amen. Anyone else
[34:05] have a request on your heart this
[34:06] morning for the entire day? Dennis, did
[34:10] you have her? Yes, brother. Continue to
[34:14] remember in prayer. Um, she had a preop
[34:19] this past Tuesday. She'll have surgery
[34:21] on July 10th. She's a little nervous.
[34:25] This is the second surgery just in the
[34:28] matter of few months between. So, we
[34:32] know our able.
[34:35] Amen. Make a way and touch him. Yes.
[34:38] Yes. Praise the Lord. Sounds like with
[34:41] everything going on, talk to Brother
[34:42] Dennis, I hope he doesn't mind me saying
[34:44] this, she's been a lot more inquisitive
[34:46] to Brother Dennis about scripture and
[34:48] things lately. So, amen. We just see the
[34:52] hand of the Lord moving in her. Yes.
[34:54] Praise the Lord. Yeah. Let me uh say
[34:58] this since you brought it up. God bless
[34:59] you.
[35:02] I just shared the quote what brother
[35:04] Graham said about the pope coming out of
[35:07] America
[35:08] and uh she took it the only thing which
[35:11] I believe it's a lying spirit the
[35:14] heavenly spirit she cannot take now
[35:18] preaching and brother Brown when he gets
[35:21] anointed wow he sets us on fire there's
[35:24] people like her it bothers her and
[35:28] that's why I had to read that quote
[35:31] and um just pray that she's starting to
[35:34] soften her heart more. Amen. Like you
[35:36] said, good. But that's that's one thing
[35:38] that's holding her back. Praise the
[35:40] Lord. We call it anointed preaching.
[35:42] Yes, it's anointed.
[35:44] Amen. To me, I've been in both. Uh I can
[35:48] tell the difference between an anointed
[35:49] minister and just the one that's
[35:51] yelling.
[35:53] There is a difference. But I understand
[35:55] that. Uh brother, she's not the only
[35:57] one. Anyone anyone else
[36:02] have an unspoken request?
[36:05] Always do. Let's stand to our feet if we
[36:06] could
[36:09] ask brother to this. Lord Jesus, it's an
[36:14] honor to be in your house once again.
[36:16] Yes, Lord Jesus. Lord, you said when two
[36:18] or three are gathered in your name,
[36:20] you'll be in our Amen. Yes. And that's
[36:22] what makes it all worth it, Father.
[36:25] There's more than three of us, not much
[36:28] more. But Father, we know that your
[36:31] presence is here. We know you're here to
[36:35] hear our needs and meet our needs
[36:38] according to your Thank you, Jesus.
[36:41] Thank you, Lord. We know, Father, that
[36:43] the enemy, the devil's fighting us
[36:46] harder than ever before.
[36:49] when the people your people that are
[36:51] called by your name that should humble
[36:54] themselves and be gathered together that
[36:57] much more knowing the days are numbered
[37:00] then end is almost here. Yes. But
[37:04] they're staying away from your house.
[37:07] They're staying away from praying like
[37:10] they should. They're staying away from
[37:13] reading your word, Father. They're
[37:16] staying away from paying their tithes
[37:18] and giving their offerings. Lord, it's
[37:22] these are simple things. You have made
[37:25] yourself the greatest one of all, the
[37:29] creator of heavens and earth, the
[37:32] creators of the universe. Amen.
[37:35] Hallelujah. You have made yourself
[37:37] simple to be understood. You have sent a
[37:41] message by your grace as your word said
[37:45] you would to get a bride ready for a
[37:48] rapture. Amen. Yes. But like you spoke
[37:51] to Israel at one time, I have stretched
[37:55] out my hands to a disobedient and a
[38:00] gains people. And I believe that's what
[38:03] you're doing to your bride right now. I
[38:07] have stretched my hands to a disobedient
[38:11] engagement
[38:13] that refuse to line up with my word. I
[38:18] heard your prophet say, "Father,
[38:21] that you'll be a small group that'll
[38:24] fully embrace the revelation of this
[38:27] word, of the message of the hour." Amen.
[38:30] We're seeing it, Father, when people
[38:34] know that the end time is right before
[38:37] scripture and prophecy is being
[38:40] fulfilled. Churches that believe the
[38:43] word for the hour should fill up, but
[38:45] it's doing the opposite. We love them.
[38:48] Deal with their hearts, Father. Yes,
[38:50] God. Bring your people fully and
[38:52] disobedient to you where whatever it
[38:55] takes. And Lord, my brother, he told me
[38:59] just before service started that these
[39:02] hornets were landing on the screen doors
[39:05] of the people of his apartments. These
[39:08] are devils. We rebuke you, Satan. In the
[39:12] name of Jesus Christ, you have no hold
[39:16] on God's people. We adjure you to leave
[39:19] and get these hornets away from my
[39:22] brother's complex. And Lord, our
[39:25] precious sister Lydia. Oh Lord, our dear
[39:29] precious sister that has suffered so
[39:32] much. Lord, we serve a God of the
[39:37] impossible.
[39:38] We stand on your word. Amen. That if two
[39:42] shall agree on any glory, it shall come
[39:44] to pass. Thank you, Lord. Fors seek my
[39:47] kingdom and my righteousness and your
[39:49] your desires shall be be met should be
[39:52] full. Jesus. And father, our sister, we
[39:56] know you can heal her even now
[39:58] completely. Let your will be done. We
[40:02] believe complete and totally deliverance
[40:05] from this cancer. Amen. But father, if
[40:08] it's your will for her to go home, may
[40:11] she not suffer much. Amen. Yes, Lord.
[40:14] Lord, for we know we'll see her soon if
[40:17] you're going to take her in that
[40:19] glorified body. Oh, God. And father
[40:23] uh the other requests I trying to
[40:27] remember oh lord my wife who's having
[40:30] surgery you're opening her heart you're
[40:33] touching her heart I couldn't even
[40:35] mention brother Brandham to her where
[40:37] she'll get so hard and angry but now
[40:41] Lord she's somewhat listening you can
[40:43] open up her heart completely to the
[40:46] truth of your revealed word for this
[40:48] hour that Lord we know that you are in
[40:52] control of this surgery that's coming
[40:54] up. You're our great physician, our high
[40:57] priest that can be touched by the
[40:59] feelings of our infirmities. Amen. And
[41:02] with your stripes, we are healed. Thank
[41:04] you, Lord. Sister Sharia, the precious
[41:06] children that are sick this morning. May
[41:09] you touch him as well. Grant it, God.
[41:11] And bless our brother, Lord. He worked
[41:13] long hours. He's tired, but he's a
[41:16] faithful servant. He wants to be used of
[41:19] thee this morning. speak through him
[41:22] that our hearts will be that much
[41:25] stronger in the faith as your word comes
[41:28] forth. Thank you, Father.
[41:30] Grant every unspoken prayer request, may
[41:34] their cuff runth over they as they reach
[41:37] out to you. In your name we pray in the
[41:40] name of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[41:43] Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[41:47] Lord. You can be seated.
[41:50] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[41:53] Praise God. We're going to go over to
[41:54] song number 698.
[41:57] Amen. Songs number 698.
[42:00] I had this song on my heart.
[42:03] I hadn't sang it in a while, but when I
[42:05] wrote up this list, it came on my heart.
[42:07] And then I felt that u maybe I hope
[42:11] maybe sister Lydia might be watching.
[42:13] I'm going to sing this in dedication to
[42:15] her this morning. Amen. Amen. 698. He's
[42:18] God on the mountain. Yes, he is.
[42:22] Amen. Help me sing it, too. You know,
[42:25] you know this is a hard one for me. So,
[42:27] help me to sing it now this morning.
[42:30] Life is easy
[42:33] when you're up on the mountain
[42:38] and you've got peace of mind
[42:42] like you've never known.
[42:47] But then things changing.
[42:51] You're down in the valley.
[42:54] [Music]
[42:55] Well, don't lose faith, boy.
[42:59] You are never alone.
[43:04] Cuz the God on the mountain
[43:08] is still God in the valley.

[43:15] [Music]
[43:17] he makes them right.
[43:20] And the God of the good times,
[43:25] he's still God in the bad times.
[43:29] The God of the days
[43:33] is still God in the night.
[43:37] We talk of faith when
[43:42] we're up on the mountain.
[43:45] [Music]
[43:46] The talk comes easy
[43:50] when life's at its best.
[43:54] But it's down in the valley
[43:58] of trials and temptations.
[44:03] That's when faith is
[44:07] really put to the test.
[44:11] For the God of the mountain
[44:14] [Music]
[44:15] is too high in the valley.
[44:20] When things go wrong,
[44:24] he makes them right.
[44:28] And the God of the
[44:42] And let's sing that last verse again.
[44:45] We talk of faith when
[44:49] we're up on the mountain.
[44:53] The talk comes so easy
[44:58] when life's at its best.
[45:02] but is down in the valley
[45:06] of those trials and temptations.
[45:09] [Music]
[45:11] For that's when faith is
[45:14] really put to the test.
[45:18] For the God of the mountain,
[45:23] he's still God in the valley.
[45:27] When things go wrong,
[45:31] he makes them right.
[45:35] And the God of the good times, he's
[45:40] still God in the bad times.

[45:48] is still God in the night. One more
[45:51] time. All the God of the mountain

[50:05] Praise the Lord. Anyone else in?
[50:09] Yes. Uh yesterday, you know, with Frank
[50:12] service. Um I had an opportunity to talk
[50:18] to some of my family members I had seen
[50:21] in decades.
[50:23] And um I told them that Frankie's life
[50:28] is to God that
[50:31] this his life is done and just little
[50:35] things I was able to testify and um I
[50:40] also was able to speak to the head
[50:42] priest. Uh I never will call him father
[50:45] because that's an abomination
[50:48] where I've been called
[50:51] and
[50:53] I thank him. He did so much to get that
[50:56] service together.
[50:58] And I must testify for the glory of God.
[51:01] I told my wife in that service yesterday
[51:05] that I couldn't pray. It was such
[51:07] abomination doing something saying pray
[51:10] to Mary. I couldn't pray. I walked into
[51:14] this little sanctuary. I could feel the
[51:16] presence of God. Yes. I could pray and I
[51:19] just could worship God. Amen. and my
[51:22] family. I I owe my faith and my
[51:25] obligation to the Lord first and after I
[51:28] was there bringing the people when the
[51:30] rosary started, we left because that's
[51:33] not a part of our our faith. And um then
[51:38] sister Sonia showing up was another
[51:40] testimony, a sister, a walking epistle
[51:43] read of all men. Amen. And so, you know,
[51:48] every little thing that we do, live that
[51:52] life and we're walking Bibles.
[51:56] Yes. Amen. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[51:58] Wonderful. Amen. God is good. Yes. Amen.
[52:02] Praise the Lord. Let's all stand to our
[52:04] feet if we could.
[52:06] Go ahead and turn the scripture. Romans
[52:07] chapter 8.
[52:09] Amen. Our adoption chapter. Uh Romans
[52:13] chapter 8. Start verse. We'll do 14-1 17
[52:16] again. Amen. Romans 8:14-17.
[52:20] Starting on adoption part 19,
[52:22] positioning Christ part three. Amen. And
[52:26] uh I guess just getting few more parts
[52:28] of it because I'm just I'm basically
[52:32] just trying to stop at a place where I
[52:34] feel led. Amen. Amen. And Lord willing,
[52:37] we just we try to pick it up the next
[52:39] the next time. I found out uh Sonia was
[52:42] telling me last night and talking to
[52:43] some other people. There's two or three
[52:44] other me ministers, you know, around and
[52:47] preaching on adoption, too. I had no
[52:49] idea, but the Lord knows in us while we
[52:53] try to do what we can for the glory of
[52:55] the Lord. Yes. Amen. Romans chapter
[52:57] 8:14. Let's just bow our heads for
[52:59] another word of prayer if we could.
[53:01] Precious Jesus, so very thankful again
[53:03] today, your grace, your mercy, Lord.
[53:05] Thank you for being here. Thank you.
[53:07] Feeling your presence, Lord, and knowing
[53:09] that you are the same, God. I I just I
[53:13] have to be honest with myself and this
[53:15] congregation.
[53:17] If I didn't feel your presence right
[53:19] now, I'd probably leave. But God,
[53:21] because I know that you are here, and I
[53:23] know that you are present, and I know
[53:25] your word is true, and I know you're
[53:27] going to bless us and strengthen us and
[53:30] speak to us, Lord. God, then anything
[53:32] and everything we can do, God, to be a
[53:34] praise, to be a help, to glorify and
[53:37] magnify you, God, we want to do it. We
[53:40] just commit ourselves to you, Father,
[53:42] and just pray the remaining part of this
[53:43] service, Lord. May you speak through
[53:45] these lips towards you to have us to
[53:47] hear, Lord, not return it and return it,
[53:50] Lord, unto us according to your perfect
[53:52] will of why you sent it forth for. We
[53:55] trust you this morning, Lord. We pray,
[53:57] God, for those who weren't able to make
[53:58] it for some reason, Lord. And God bless
[54:00] those that have come, those may be
[54:02] watching. Lord, we just commit it to
[54:04] you, Lord, now and just uh commit myself
[54:06] into your hands. Let it be according to
[54:08] your perfect will and your word as you
[54:11] speak to us this morning in the precious
[54:13] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[54:14] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. In Romans
[54:18] chapter 8, verse 14. Amen. We'll read
[54:22] again. For as many as are led by the
[54:23] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[54:25] For you have not received the spirit of
[54:27] bondage again to fear, but you have
[54:28] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[54:30] we cry, aba, father. The spirit itself
[54:33] bears witness with our spirit, that we
[54:35] are the children of God, and if
[54:36] children, then hes of God and joint hes
[54:40] with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[54:43] with him, that we may be also glorified
[54:46] together. You could be seated if you'd
[54:48] like.
[54:50] Amen.
[54:52] We left off last week in talking about
[54:54] the
[54:56] our callings, our elections, the
[54:57] uniqueness, uh making our calling and
[55:00] election sure, making sure that we
[55:02] understand that God has uh brought us
[55:05] through and has handpicked us for
[55:07] specific time, for specific place, for
[55:10] specific reason. Amen. And God has
[55:12] placed us where he wants us to be of use
[55:14] to him, to be in service for him. and
[55:17] recognizing the scripture says that we
[55:19] recognize and do these things that we
[55:22] cannot fall. Amen. Amen. We will not
[55:25] fall. We continue to stand in the glory
[55:27] of the Lord and we stand in his presence
[55:29] and stand on his word and stand on what
[55:32] God has given us. So that the scripture
[55:34] says we've done all to stand. Stand
[55:37] therefore. Amen. So we continue to
[55:39] stand. We continue to press this battle.
[55:42] We continue to do what the Lord called
[55:44] us to do. Don't despise. Remember, we
[55:46] talked about last week and we talked
[55:48] about that little washing, not despising
[55:50] what God has uh done for us or where
[55:52] God's put us or what God's called us to
[55:55] do. We don't despise those things. We
[55:57] don't uh try to be something we're not.
[55:59] We don't try to fulfill a position we
[56:01] don't belong in. We don't try to uh uh
[56:04] do any carnal impersonations. We want to
[56:07] be who God has made us and what God has
[56:09] made us only. and put in that place
[56:12] because you recognize God has made us
[56:14] for that purpose. God has put us there
[56:17] for that purpose. God raised us in the
[56:19] home, the family, the people, the
[56:21] family, the parents, and all exactly to
[56:23] bring us to who we are. Now, I want to
[56:25] go to Psalms chapter uh 139. Read one
[56:30] verse of scripture.
[56:33] Amen. Psalm uh Psalms 139 and 14. Amen.
[56:39] Psalms
[56:40] 139 and 14.
[56:45] Amen. We all know the scripture very
[56:47] well. It's uh songs have been made about
[56:51] this scripture. Of course, this is a
[56:53] psalm. So, but I mean modern uh
[56:56] songwriters have written songs including
[56:58] this scripture. Amen. But I want to read
[57:01] it this morning. Psalms 139:14. I will
[57:04] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[57:08] wonderfully made. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[57:11] Marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[57:14] knoweth right well. Now the Bible says
[57:17] David recognizing that I am and you have
[57:21] to be that I. Not I, but you I and all
[57:24] of us eyes. We're all eyes. Amen. Amen.
[57:28] I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Now
[57:31] look at this word fearfully. of course
[57:33] we know means uh reverently. It's in
[57:36] reverence. Uh God created us. God made
[57:39] us. Uh each individual, not just Adam,
[57:43] not just man in the beginning, but you
[57:45] individually, you purposefully. Amen. I
[57:48] believe he made Adam purposefully to be
[57:50] what Adam was to do what Adam did to be
[57:54] the man that Adam was. Even with the
[57:55] fall, God called Adam for a purpose.
[57:58] Amen. For a reason. Even though we may
[58:00] fall, even though we may make make
[58:02] mistakes, even though we may do things
[58:04] uh that are contrary or displeasing, the
[58:07] Lord still made us for that purpose, for
[58:09] that reason. Amen. We got to also
[58:11] recognize that God made because brother
[58:14] Brandham said so. It's not my words. God
[58:17] made Hitler to do what he did, right?
[58:20] God made Hitler, the man, he made him at
[58:22] that time, at that place, in that
[58:24] situation, to do what he did. Yes. You
[58:26] can't think that anything is out of
[58:29] God's control. Everything is in God's
[58:31] control. Amen. Amen. Although Satan's
[58:34] Eden belongs to Satan and it's evolving
[58:36] into the place that we know it to be
[58:38] just a demonic place this earth is, but
[58:41] God is still in control regardless of
[58:43] what it is. And and he but we were
[58:47] fearfully. Amen. Reverently and
[58:49] wonderfully. Now, wonderfully is a
[58:51] beautiful word because you go look it
[58:53] up. It talks about being distinguished.
[58:56] Amen. Being distinguished, being one of
[58:58] a kind. You weren't just fearfully made,
[59:02] but you were made to be one of a kind.
[59:04] Amen. You were made to be distinguished.
[59:07] You were made to be distinctive from
[59:09] everybody else for a purpose that God's
[59:13] made you above anything else. Like we
[59:15] said, uh there may be thousands of
[59:18] pastors that God made. Amen. There may
[59:21] be uh tens or hundreds of thousands of
[59:24] ministers that God made. There may be
[59:27] tens of thousands of pastors that God
[59:29] made to fill that specific position. But
[59:32] nobody can fill that one specific
[59:35] position, that one specific pullpit,
[59:38] that one specific church, but that
[59:40] person that God called. Amen. Amen. And
[59:43] God called for that reason, for that
[59:45] purpose. Amen. Just like uh we read the
[59:49] uh God called that scripture that quote
[59:52] that brother Graham was talking about.
[59:54] God called this mother and God called
[59:56] this farmer and God called this to be
[59:58] that mother to be that farmer to be that
[1:00:00] housewife whatever the position is. But
[1:00:02] see there may be millions of housewives.
[1:00:06] There may be there may be millions of
[1:00:09] farmers but there's only one specific
[1:00:11] one for that purpose. Right. Amen.
[1:00:14] adoption
[1:00:16] wonderfully one of a kind that and that
[1:00:18] goes back to our first Peter scripture.
[1:00:20] Amen. You're calling an election.
[1:00:21] Remember what election was? Our election
[1:00:24] was handpicked by God. Yes. Amen. Well,
[1:00:26] David's basically saying the same thing.
[1:00:29] Wonderfully made is made. You're made as
[1:00:31] one of a kind. You were made
[1:00:33] distinctively. You were distinguished.
[1:00:35] God called you for a purpose. Amen. And
[1:00:38] David recognized that. So, we want to be
[1:00:41] who God's made us to be. We want to live
[1:00:44] the life and be the person that God made
[1:00:46] us to be. No carnal impersonations. No
[1:00:48] trying to take somebody else's place. No
[1:00:51] trying to be like somebody else. But be
[1:00:53] the one that God called you to be. Be
[1:00:55] that pl be that person. Fulfill that
[1:00:58] position. Brother Bram said this. Now
[1:01:01] Wednesday night, many of you wasn't
[1:01:02] there Wednesday night. We got into I
[1:01:04] believe the third verse uh fifth verse
[1:01:07] on unto adoption or adoption or placing
[1:01:11] a people.
[1:01:13] How that God trying to place his people
[1:01:16] and when God places one look what he
[1:01:18] says now when God places one then all
[1:01:21] the whole church wants to be like that
[1:01:23] one right? Amen. Have the same kind of
[1:01:26] things do the same things. You see it's
[1:01:28] the same way. I I found it striking. I
[1:01:32] never really said it in a sense, but
[1:01:35] there was a brother that we were talking
[1:01:36] to and uh about another brother, not
[1:01:39] gossip, but just how the people are
[1:01:41] doing and stuff. But that that that
[1:01:43] brother had left the message. He was a
[1:01:45] pastor and he had left the message. And
[1:01:47] when he left the message, uh he kind of
[1:01:50] just let the congregation go and the
[1:01:53] people just started living all kinds of
[1:01:55] lives and dressing all kinds of ways and
[1:01:58] women cutting their hair and all these
[1:01:59] things.
[1:02:00] I'm thinking
[1:02:02] I if if if you've lived this way this
[1:02:05] whole time, Amen. and you can flip just
[1:02:09] like that because somebody said it's not
[1:02:12] important anymore that then you are just
[1:02:15] living legalism. Right. If if you're
[1:02:19] living the way you live because God
[1:02:21] revealed it to you, I don't care what
[1:02:23] anybody else says. Nobody can change
[1:02:25] that because God gave it to you. Not a
[1:02:28] man, not a preacher, but God. When God
[1:02:31] reveals it to you, I do this and I live
[1:02:33] this way because I have conviction that
[1:02:36] God revealed this to me and now I know
[1:02:39] this is the way God wants me to live.
[1:02:41] And if you want to change just like that
[1:02:44] just because uh you may have left the
[1:02:46] message or the pastor, preacher,
[1:02:49] whatever says something different or
[1:02:50] something, then you didn't have it to
[1:02:52] start with in my opinion. I mean, I hate
[1:02:54] to say it that way, but that's the
[1:02:55] truth. you never had it start with. You
[1:02:57] were just living legalism. And see,
[1:02:59] that's the problem. A lot of people
[1:03:01] don't seem to understand. They all think
[1:03:03] that all we do is legalism, but it's
[1:03:05] not. It may be a a lot of people may
[1:03:07] live in legalism. But there's a majority
[1:03:10] of people or or I'll just say at least
[1:03:12] God's bride aren't living legalism. They
[1:03:15] live the way they live because they have
[1:03:16] conviction, because they have a
[1:03:18] revelation from God. Right? Not because
[1:03:21] somebody preached it or or a pastor said
[1:03:24] it, but because God revealed to you this
[1:03:28] is what he wants from you. This is what
[1:03:30] he wants you to do. This is how he wants
[1:03:32] you to live. Right? Amen. And God when
[1:03:35] God shows that, then that's conviction.
[1:03:37] Then then it's over. that that struggle,
[1:03:40] that battle is finished to get there and
[1:03:43] say, "Well, I wonder if God would be
[1:03:45] okay if I just cut a little bit of hair
[1:03:46] or I wonder if God would be okay if I
[1:03:48] just, you know, if I just uh got drunk a
[1:03:51] time or two or I just I wonder if God
[1:03:53] would be okay." No, there's no
[1:03:55] conviction to that. See, when God
[1:03:57] reveals it to you, the battle's over.
[1:04:00] Amen. There's no more struggle. There's
[1:04:02] no more strife. Uh there's there's
[1:04:04] nothing anybody can say that'll talk you
[1:04:06] out of it, right? Amen. or shame you
[1:04:09] into it. I know sometimes the guys they
[1:04:12] do it goofingly, funnyly, but but every
[1:04:15] once in a while they'll try to they'll
[1:04:17] try to uh oh, what do you joke it into
[1:04:22] uh having me drink or something? Um I I
[1:04:26] forgot what it was the last job somebody
[1:04:29] said. Well, that's See, that's because
[1:04:31] he drinks uh it's the drinking beer does
[1:04:34] that or something. And and I'm like,
[1:04:38] well, well, he drinks all the time and
[1:04:40] he's not like this. But, you know, just
[1:04:42] doing silly stuff to try to make you
[1:04:44] feel ashamed that you don't drink or
[1:04:46] something like that.
[1:04:48] That's just a devil. There's nothing
[1:04:51] going to change that. It's nothing going
[1:04:52] to make me uh divert to be something.
[1:04:55] God's God has revealed to me, amen, who
[1:04:59] I'm supposed to be and how I'm supposed
[1:05:01] to live. And nobody can tell me any
[1:05:03] different. Right. And if you can and if
[1:05:06] you had that struggle, if there's that
[1:05:08] to turn you just like that, it was never
[1:05:10] there to start with. That's right. Amen.
[1:05:11] That conviction was never there. That
[1:05:13] conviction was never never there.
[1:05:15] Revelation never there to begin with.
[1:05:18] Amen. But God trying to make his people
[1:05:21] look
[1:05:23] the whole church wanting to be like that
[1:05:25] one. What is that? That's just carnal
[1:05:27] impersonation, right? Amen. There's no
[1:05:30] revelation to that, right? There's no
[1:05:32] conviction to that. Amen. No matter how
[1:05:35] good that person might be at
[1:05:37] impersonating somebody else. And
[1:05:39] honestly, I think I may have mentioned
[1:05:41] this before. I know at least one
[1:05:44] specific very well-known minister in
[1:05:46] this message who told me that he
[1:05:49] purposely patterned himself after
[1:05:51] another well-known minister's me uh
[1:05:54] ministry
[1:05:57] told personally. I know for a fact that
[1:06:01] he purposely mimicked this other
[1:06:04] minister. He told me that. That's just
[1:06:07] carnal impersonation. Amen. Amen. He may
[1:06:09] be great at it. I mean, he may be a
[1:06:12] pastor that's got a church full of
[1:06:15] people, but that's just carnal
[1:06:16] impersonation. Amen. God didn't call me
[1:06:18] to be like so and so. He didn't call you
[1:06:20] to be like so and so. He called you to
[1:06:22] be who you are. Brother Abraham said,
[1:06:24] "We are cut out different.
[1:06:27] We are made different. We are nature
[1:06:30] different. We are positionally placed
[1:06:32] different. Each for a different work.
[1:06:35] Maybe one for just a little kind of
[1:06:37] work, another for a large work. I
[1:06:40] believe it was David, one of the
[1:06:41] prophets. I forget now. He said, "I
[1:06:43] would rather be a doormat in the house
[1:06:44] of the Lord than to dwell in tents with
[1:06:46] the wicked." Amen. Amen. To be who you
[1:06:49] are. Now look, doors end door. Let me
[1:06:51] read this. When Miss Amy Simple
[1:06:54] McFersonson when she was here on earth
[1:06:56] in her ministry, they say that pretty
[1:06:59] near every woman preacher wore these
[1:07:01] wings like I don't even know what that
[1:07:03] is. Have
[1:07:05] I know what wings are, but she had
[1:07:07] something under when she raised her arm.
[1:07:08] It looked like wings or something. Is
[1:07:10] that I I guess I've never looked this
[1:07:12] up. I probably should look a picture up
[1:07:13] so I don't know what I'm talking about.
[1:07:15] Amen. But brother Rams said pretty near
[1:07:18] every woman preacher wore those wings
[1:07:21] like you know or gowns like that and
[1:07:23] packed the Bible. I guess just the same
[1:07:26] way. Uh just look at Billy Grahams in
[1:07:29] the land today. But you know Billy
[1:07:31] Graham could never take your place.
[1:07:35] Right. Amen. I'll go so far as to say
[1:07:38] brother Brandham could never take your
[1:07:40] place. Amen. Amen. That's right. Billy
[1:07:43] Graham could never take your place. I
[1:07:45] couldn't take Billy's place. He couldn't
[1:07:47] take mine. I can't take yours and you
[1:07:49] can't take mine. You're an individual in
[1:07:52] God. God made you the way you are for
[1:07:54] some purpose. If we would like, if you
[1:07:57] would just find our place, just find our
[1:07:59] place. And there abide
[1:08:03] abide there. If we try to do something
[1:08:06] different, then we're in somebody else's
[1:08:09] territory, which we just start to gum up
[1:08:12] the whole picture of God. Amen. We'll
[1:08:14] get to that in just a minute. I want to
[1:08:16] read a scripture and then we'll start
[1:08:17] talking about to to see that we gum up
[1:08:21] the picture of God. Well, look now if
[1:08:25] excuse me if you're just if you're
[1:08:27] gumming up the picture of God, you're
[1:08:30] not just gumming up the picture of God
[1:08:32] for you.
[1:08:34] You if you're a part of the body of
[1:08:36] Christ and you're a member of the bride,
[1:08:38] you're not gumming up the picture just
[1:08:40] for you. You're gumming up the picture
[1:08:42] for the entire body. Amen. Because we
[1:08:45] are one, right? Amen. We are one body.
[1:08:49] And when one member of the body's out of
[1:08:51] line, the whole body's out of line.
[1:08:53] Yeah. When brother Brandham had that
[1:08:55] vision of of the bride and she's going
[1:08:58] through and marching to like Homeward
[1:09:00] Christian soldiers, I believe he said,
[1:09:02] instep perfectly dressed ladies, hair
[1:09:05] down their back, beautiful. He said
[1:09:07] there towards the end they they started
[1:09:10] getting out of line or out of step a
[1:09:12] little bit and he come back out of the
[1:09:15] vision sitting in the room yelling get
[1:09:17] back in line. Yes. Or get back in step
[1:09:20] whichever it was in that in that way
[1:09:23] because he had gotten out of line. Well
[1:09:24] well who had gotten out of line? Not
[1:09:27] just that one. The whole bride then at
[1:09:29] that point was out of line. Right? You
[1:09:31] say, "Well, how can the whole how can
[1:09:33] the whole bride be out of line when just
[1:09:35] one person is out of line?" Because
[1:09:37] we're all the same. We're all in one.
[1:09:39] We're all a part of the same body. Amen.
[1:09:43] If this eyeball doesn't want to be an
[1:09:45] eyeball and rather be a finger, it's not
[1:09:47] going to be a it's going to be a
[1:09:49] deformed body. Amen. That body will be
[1:09:51] deformed. Amen. If the finger sticking
[1:09:54] out here and the eye is right here, it's
[1:09:57] going to be a deformed body. Period.
[1:10:00] Yeah, every other part of the body might
[1:10:02] be perfectly right, but it's deformed
[1:10:04] because this one and this one's not
[1:10:06] where they're supposed to be and doing
[1:10:07] what they're supposed to be doing. It's
[1:10:09] deformed at that point. Brother Bam said
[1:10:12] that one sin in the camp can cause the
[1:10:16] entire camp to bitterly fail. Yes. And
[1:10:19] you look at Achen in the scripture and
[1:10:21] you can see scripturally how that is
[1:10:23] true. Yes. Achen caused the entire camp.
[1:10:26] He caused men to lose their lives.
[1:10:30] Amen. Men to lose their lives. You say,
[1:10:32] "But God, you promised me." That's why
[1:10:35] Joshua was God enough. Went back and
[1:10:36] went to God and said, "God, you said
[1:10:38] there we wouldn't lose one man. Now,
[1:10:40] what's going on here?" Right. Right.
[1:10:43] Amen. Either either sin's in the camp or
[1:10:46] you're a liar, God. Right. But we know
[1:10:49] we know God's not a liar. But one but
[1:10:52] men died.
[1:10:54] We're going to find out why, right? And
[1:10:56] God told him, said, "It's because of
[1:10:58] this." They went over and found that
[1:11:01] Babylonian garment wedge and all and
[1:11:03] they killed Achen and his whole family.
[1:11:07] God, they eradicated the disease. They
[1:11:10] eradicated the sin. And they went back
[1:11:12] out to battle and didn't lose one man
[1:11:15] because God was at his word. God is
[1:11:18] always as good as his word. Yes. Amen.
[1:11:21] Praise the Lord. Sometimes we get in the
[1:11:24] place to say, "God, but you promised me,
[1:11:28] but it's got to be in line with the
[1:11:29] word." Amen. God, you promised me that
[1:11:33] you would take care of me. God, you
[1:11:34] promised me that you would provide for
[1:11:36] me. Yes, he does. He will. Absolutely.
[1:11:39] Amen. But we must be lined up with the
[1:11:41] word. Amen. Maybe God's trying to teach
[1:11:43] us a lesson. Amen. God had to get the
[1:11:46] children of Israel. He had to get them
[1:11:48] back in line. He had to get that sin out
[1:11:50] of the camp so he could get back in line
[1:11:52] again. And men lost their lives because
[1:11:54] one man was out of line and killed and
[1:11:58] killed his whole family. Not just the
[1:12:00] man, his entire family. Amen. They went
[1:12:03] back to battle and they were back in the
[1:12:05] will of God. Right. Won won every battle
[1:12:08] then. Didn't lose a man. God honors his
[1:12:11] word. God honors God always honors his
[1:12:14] word. Amen. That's why when we come to
[1:12:17] this purpose and God said we just find
[1:12:20] just or find our place and abide there
[1:12:24] if we do something different where
[1:12:25] somebody else's territory we gum up the
[1:12:27] entire picture of God. It affects the
[1:12:30] entire body. Amen. Not just me, not just
[1:12:34] a church, not just our lives or family,
[1:12:38] but the whole picture gets gummed up
[1:12:40] then. The whole body is suffering. The
[1:12:42] whole body is deformed because of this
[1:12:44] one situation, this one person. Amen.
[1:12:47] That's why it's so important to
[1:12:49] understand why we find our position.
[1:12:51] Amen. I I I hope that I've of course
[1:12:54] illustrated that quite clearly over the
[1:12:56] past few services, but how important it
[1:13:00] is to make sure that we're in our
[1:13:01] calling. We make sure that our calling
[1:13:04] is and our election is sure because that
[1:13:07] is where uh that is where we stand.
[1:13:10] That's what we stand on. Amen. To have
[1:13:12] to have the entire body come together as
[1:13:14] one. Right. Amen. To come together as
[1:13:17] one. We can't gum up that picture. Yes.
[1:13:20] That picture's got to be what God made
[1:13:21] it to be in every part and every portion
[1:13:24] of that body. Amen. The the the the skin
[1:13:28] on the bottom of my big toe is just as
[1:13:30] important as the skin on the end of my
[1:13:32] nose. Amen. Amen. Just as important.
[1:13:35] It's all part of the same body. We can't
[1:13:36] gum up that picture. Amen. Abide in that
[1:13:39] calling. Be the person that God called
[1:13:42] you to be. Yes. Amen. We take like Billy
[1:13:44] Graham in this denominational world
[1:13:46] today as he is a as he's if we would
[1:13:50] call it maybe the football player. He's
[1:13:52] got the ball. Now, if you try to take
[1:13:54] the ball away from your own man, you're
[1:13:57] just messing up your own team, right?
[1:13:59] Amen. The whole team. You want to win.
[1:14:02] You win or lose as a team. Guard your
[1:14:05] man. See, keep guarding him. keep the
[1:14:07] rest of them so he can run and he'll
[1:14:09] make a touchdown after a while. Jesus
[1:14:11] will be come and it'll all be over,
[1:14:14] right? Amen. Back in the spirit, God
[1:14:16] will the Lord will come and and and God
[1:14:19] will take his beautiful, perfect, not
[1:14:22] deformed, but perfectly formed,
[1:14:24] perfectly positioned body. He is going
[1:14:26] to take her home. Amen. Because she is
[1:14:29] his bride. Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:32] And she's going to take him home to be
[1:14:34] with him. Praise the Lord. Now, look at
[1:14:36] this. We'll go back. I think I finished.
[1:14:38] I I may have read this last week. I
[1:14:40] couldn't remember for sure if I did or
[1:14:41] not, but I want to go back to 1
[1:14:43] Corinthians or go to 1 Corinthians, uh,
[1:14:46] chapter 7. Amen. If I read it last week,
[1:14:49] it was with the understanding it was
[1:14:51] just to try to, uh, get us to the to
[1:14:54] this point today. Amen. 1 Corinthians
[1:14:57] chapter 7.
[1:15:03] Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 7. to go
[1:15:06] along in with
[1:15:09] this that we've just read from David and
[1:15:11] the quote
[1:15:13] 1 Corinthians 7:20. Let every man abide
[1:15:16] in the same calling wherein he was
[1:15:19] called. Amen. Calling, abiding, living,
[1:15:24] existing,
[1:15:26] uh fulfilling, abiding in that call.
[1:15:30] Abide in that same calling wherein he
[1:15:32] was called.
[1:15:34] Art thou called, being a servant, care
[1:15:36] not for it?
[1:15:38] We did read this. I remember now.
[1:15:43] Being a servant, care not for it. But if
[1:15:45] thou uh mayest be made free, use it
[1:15:48] rather. For he that is called in the
[1:15:50] Lord, being a Lord's servant, is the
[1:15:53] Lord's free man. Likewise also he that
[1:15:56] is called being free is Christ's
[1:15:58] servant. Ye are bought with a price. Be
[1:16:02] not ye be not ye the servants of men.
[1:16:04] Brethren, let every man wherein he is
[1:16:07] called therein abide with God in in that
[1:16:11] calling in the call that God has called
[1:16:14] us to be in. Amen. Amen. God is want God
[1:16:18] has called us to that place to abide to
[1:16:20] live there. Amen. To be that position to
[1:16:24] be in that position to be in that place
[1:16:26] that God has called us to be in. Amen.
[1:16:28] Amen. because that position was made and
[1:16:31] to be fulfilled by me. Amen. To be
[1:16:35] fulfilled by you. Yes. In whatever that
[1:16:37] that God uh placed in that position for
[1:16:40] us to be. Amen. Unless every portion,
[1:16:44] unless every part of the body is in its
[1:16:47] proper position, its proper place, the
[1:16:49] body is deformed. Amen. Now, let's go
[1:16:53] back and let me I got a couple of
[1:16:54] scriptures before uh quotes before I
[1:16:56] move on. influence.
[1:17:00] Now,
[1:17:03] influence.
[1:17:05] God orders his man and you can't take
[1:17:08] another one's place. If you do, you're
[1:17:12] only producing a carnal impersonation.
[1:17:15] And finally, finally, it's going to be
[1:17:18] smitten. Now, brother Bam says finally,
[1:17:20] what does that mean? Means you could go
[1:17:22] a year, five years, 10 years, 20 years,
[1:17:25] 40 years. Amen. in that position. But
[1:17:28] finally, there will be a fall. There
[1:17:31] will be a smitten. Brother Bam said to
[1:17:34] be smitten. Peter called it to fall.
[1:17:37] Amen. If you're in your position abiding
[1:17:40] in your calling, you cannot fall. These
[1:17:42] things revealed to you, you live them,
[1:17:45] you cannot fall. Right. Brother Brandon
[1:17:47] says here, if you do, I if you abide in
[1:17:51] this carnal impersonation,
[1:17:53] you are finally going to be smitten. You
[1:17:56] are going to fall. Amen. And whatever
[1:18:00] whatever that is, you're going to fall.
[1:18:03] Brother Ram said, smitten. See, you
[1:18:05] can't do it. God orders you to your
[1:18:08] place. Isaiah seen this that he could
[1:18:11] not put his trust in any man. There was
[1:18:14] the greatest man that was ever on earth
[1:18:16] at the time, a king that had the rest of
[1:18:19] the world playing tribute to him. But
[1:18:21] because he got out of his place, Isaiah
[1:18:25] seen that he could not uh trust in the
[1:18:27] arm of flesh and it drove the prophet to
[1:18:30] the temple to pray. Right? Amen. Now,
[1:18:33] what's he talking about? Look at this.
[1:18:37] In scripture, a great man that God set
[1:18:40] up. Amen. I I'm not going to go back to
[1:18:43] the scripture, but you can read it in in
[1:18:45] different uh books. But I I usually when
[1:18:49] I teach the story on Uzziah, I teach it
[1:18:51] out of 2 Chronicles 26. But Uzziah was a
[1:18:56] man. He was only 16 years old when God
[1:18:58] put him up into power. Uh so but it
[1:19:02] doesn't matter if he was six or 16. If
[1:19:04] God's with him, God's with him, right?
[1:19:07] He's 6 16 or 160. If he's a man, if he's
[1:19:12] I if he's in that God God's with him,
[1:19:15] then it doesn't matter. Right. And God
[1:19:17] was with him. The Bible says God was
[1:19:19] with Uzziah. God set Uzziah up. God put
[1:19:22] him in this place. Amen. To be this king
[1:19:26] at this time, right? 16 or not. He
[1:19:29] followed in the footsteps of of of his
[1:19:32] of his fathers. And his kingdom was
[1:19:35] prosperous. And the Bible says that as
[1:19:38] long as Uzziah did what God told him to
[1:19:41] do, God made him to prosper. Amen. made
[1:19:45] Uzziah to prosper. That's right. But
[1:19:48] unfortunately,
[1:19:50] Uzziah got built up in pride. He got
[1:19:53] arrogant. He got prideful. It's his
[1:19:55] kingdom. It was his to do. And he was
[1:19:58] going to do whatever he felt like he
[1:20:01] wanted to do. I guess you'd say, "Amen."
[1:20:04] Brother Graham says, "Look, influence."
[1:20:07] He got so lifted up in his mind, he got
[1:20:12] so self-secure in everything. so much
[1:20:15] that he tried to take the place uh take
[1:20:18] a minister's place
[1:20:21] yes went into the temple burning incense
[1:20:24] try trying to take the place of the
[1:20:26] minister when the minister come in there
[1:20:28] and say hey Uzziah what you I know
[1:20:30] you're the king but what are you doing
[1:20:31] this is not your place right this is not
[1:20:34] your position this is not what you're
[1:20:36] supposed to be doing
[1:20:38] ran him out he walked in and tried to
[1:20:42] take somebody else's position right?
[1:20:44] Somebody else. The place that God had
[1:20:46] already chosen to be filled by somebody
[1:20:49] else. And Uzziah tried to do it. He
[1:20:53] tried to take a minister's place. He
[1:20:55] tried to go in and other incense as we
[1:20:58] know in the Bible to burn incense, which
[1:21:00] was only for a Levite to do it. A priest
[1:21:03] that was anointed for that job, he tried
[1:21:06] to take his place. See, Uzziah wasn't
[1:21:09] anointed
[1:21:12] to do that position. Uzziah wasn't
[1:21:14] anointed. It it was it was an anointing
[1:21:17] of Uzziah to be the king.
[1:21:20] He wasn't uni. He wasn't anointed to be
[1:21:23] a priest.
[1:21:25] The Levitical priesthood was the ones
[1:21:28] that were anointed and called positioned
[1:21:32] positionally placed to be the the priest
[1:21:35] to be the minister. It was his calling.
[1:21:39] It was his position. He is the one that
[1:21:41] God put in that place. Those the the
[1:21:44] Levitical priesthood, the Levites were
[1:21:46] put in that position. Not Uzziah, right?
[1:21:49] He had no anointing to go and do what he
[1:21:52] did. None. But sometimes when you get
[1:21:56] built up in pride and you get built up
[1:21:59] in self-secure and arrogance,
[1:22:02] the anointing kind of can take a
[1:22:04] backseat in a person's life, right?
[1:22:07] Amen. I believe that's why sometimes
[1:22:09] brother Brandham said talked about if uh
[1:22:12] uh you build up a minister so much or a
[1:22:14] pastor so much and put him up on a
[1:22:16] pedestal, all God calls that man to
[1:22:18] fall. Yeah. Amen. because you'll get up
[1:22:21] in pride and arrogance and get built up
[1:22:23] and then the anointing goes. The
[1:22:26] anointing's not important at that point.
[1:22:28] Amen. But let me tell you saints, the
[1:22:30] anointing of God is important on our
[1:22:32] lives every single second of every
[1:22:35] single day. Yes, we must have that
[1:22:38] anointing. We must and that's what God
[1:22:42] drives us to brings us through in that
[1:22:45] anointing. That's why That's why I said
[1:22:48] and told people who who talk about or
[1:22:50] talk about their children. Oh, I hate
[1:22:52] hearing that. They talk about their
[1:22:54] children, "Oh, well, if they go into the
[1:22:57] tribulation, they can still be saved."
[1:22:58] I'm like, "Oh, why would you want that?
[1:23:01] Why would you even say that?" That's
[1:23:03] right. Why would those words come off
[1:23:05] your lips for your child to go through
[1:23:07] tribulation? Yeah. I I just I I I just
[1:23:12] It just baffles me. I don't understand
[1:23:14] that. Especially since knowing that when
[1:23:17] this bride leaves this earth, the
[1:23:20] anointing of God will be gone. Except
[1:23:23] for the Jews and the anointing will be
[1:23:25] with the Jews. He'll be working with
[1:23:26] them then. In fact, he's already started
[1:23:28] that in my opinion. In my opinion, the
[1:23:32] the anointing on the Gentiles is all but
[1:23:35] gone. Amen. The anointing of God is with
[1:23:37] the Jews right now. Amen. If you can and
[1:23:40] if a person can't see that with all
[1:23:42] that's going on now over in the Middle
[1:23:44] East, I don't know how you're how
[1:23:45] anybody will see it, right? And and see
[1:23:48] what's going on in the Gentile churches
[1:23:50] and all. Amen. H how could you see that
[1:23:53] soberly and not realize that God is all
[1:23:55] but left the Jew or the Gentiles and is
[1:23:58] going back to the Jews? Now, when it's
[1:24:00] fully gone and and with the Jews means
[1:24:03] the bride won't be here, right? Amen.
[1:24:06] So, when the bride leaves up, that
[1:24:08] anointing is gone.
[1:24:09] You'll be going through that tribulation
[1:24:11] period with no anointing, with no bit of
[1:24:14] the spirit of God on you at all.
[1:24:18] I I just I don't see how a person I just
[1:24:21] People will do it. Yes. But I wouldn't
[1:24:23] wish that on my worst enemy. Amen. Much
[1:24:26] less my child or my family member. Yes.
[1:24:29] My goodness. I hear that. It just
[1:24:31] curdles my skin. I can't believe
[1:24:33] somebody would say that. But anyway, you
[1:24:36] say, "Well, they're living so and so." I
[1:24:38] don't care how they're living. Oh,
[1:24:39] they're doing so so I don't care what
[1:24:41] they're doing or it looks like. I don't
[1:24:43] care what it looks like. Yeah.
[1:24:45] Circumstances have nothing to do with my
[1:24:47] faith.
[1:24:49] My faith says you're a child of God.
[1:24:52] Period. That I don't have any There's no
[1:24:55] discussion. Amen. That's the end of it.
[1:24:57] No discussion. Praise the Lord. Well,
[1:25:00] but I No, no butts. No, there's no butts
[1:25:03] in the word. Yeah. And I I I I I'm
[1:25:07] either blindly stupid enough to believe
[1:25:09] it or I just have enough faith. I I like
[1:25:12] to believe it's faith. Amen. But that's
[1:25:14] where I stand regardless. Why would you
[1:25:17] want to do that? But see, he had no
[1:25:18] anointing. Usiah had no anointing to go
[1:25:21] and do this. The priest had the
[1:25:24] anointing. Well, if there's no anointing
[1:25:26] with Uzziah to do that, then that means
[1:25:29] what he did, God was not with him.
[1:25:34] No anointing. God is not with you.
[1:25:37] There's no anointing there. God is not
[1:25:39] with you. Amen. Because it's his
[1:25:41] anointing that he sends on you that's
[1:25:44] the approval of God being with you. God
[1:25:48] wasn't with him. He wasn't anointed for
[1:25:51] that job.
[1:25:53] He tried to take someone else's place.
[1:25:57] Now here, let me finish this quote. And
[1:25:59] here we have an influence of this king
[1:26:02] to let people know that this carnal
[1:26:04] impersonation of each other today is not
[1:26:07] of the Lord.
[1:26:09] You're not ordained to do such things.
[1:26:12] You'll never take another man's place.
[1:26:14] And another man can't take your place.
[1:26:16] Find where your place is and abide
[1:26:19] there. Yeah. It's so important.
[1:26:22] Understand that. Praise the Lord. and
[1:26:26] and and
[1:26:28] why we not be happy and satisfied with
[1:26:32] what God's called us to. Yes. Amen. Oh,
[1:26:36] praise the Lord. He thought, "Well,
[1:26:38] bless God. I I'm a king and the Lord has
[1:26:42] been good to me. I can do this. I've got
[1:26:44] this. This is my ministry." come to find
[1:26:47] out that it's on uh uh in in in his
[1:26:51] going on like that and tried to go over
[1:26:54] stepped over what God was blessing him
[1:26:56] at because remember as long as he obeyed
[1:26:59] the Lord, God made him to prosper.
[1:27:03] But he but he stepped over what God was
[1:27:05] blessing him at. You're a good lay
[1:27:08] member. If you're a good lay member, be
[1:27:10] a good lay member. Amen.
[1:27:13] If you're a good housewife, if God has
[1:27:16] blessed you as a housewife and made you
[1:27:18] loyal and true sister, you just continue
[1:27:21] to be that. Yes. Praise the Lord. Don't
[1:27:25] get to thinking you God called you to be
[1:27:27] a preacher, deacon, or something else.
[1:27:30] You do the same,
[1:27:33] man. Whatever God has blessed you, there
[1:27:36] abide because that's where he has you
[1:27:38] at. you do just what he tells you to do
[1:27:41] and see where he blesses you. We talked
[1:27:44] about that a few weeks ago and God
[1:27:46] blessing you where you are. Amen.
[1:27:49] But don't ever try to step in. That's a
[1:27:53] uh grassroots of Pentecostal when
[1:27:55] McFersonson was reading her book. Uh uh
[1:27:58] I I wasn't a minister in her days and
[1:28:02] they said when she would walk out on the
[1:28:03] platform and things like wings, you
[1:28:06] know, I still got to look that up. Or
[1:28:09] you know, uh kind of like a robe, I
[1:28:11] guess, like I guess maybe that she had a
[1:28:13] robe and had these things, wings like
[1:28:16] that. Every lady preacher wore the same
[1:28:18] thing. Every one of them carried a Bible
[1:28:21] the same way, however she did it, the
[1:28:23] same way as Miss McFersonson. Did you
[1:28:25] ever listen to those radio programs?
[1:28:28] Every fellow Lord, God bless you, real
[1:28:30] good fella. Billy Graham in carnal
[1:28:33] impersonations, right? Amen. Simple,
[1:28:37] pure carnal impersonation, which a lot
[1:28:40] of times is born out of jealousy.
[1:28:43] Amen. jealousy of somebody wanting more
[1:28:45] power or more money or more stature or
[1:28:48] more prestige or
[1:28:51] want to be the person that's out front
[1:28:53] or want to be the one that's the called
[1:28:55] one or or or whatever it is or uh
[1:28:58] somebody might have just a a gift of
[1:29:01] government or helps or something and and
[1:29:03] but yet but they want to be the one that
[1:29:05] speaks in tongues. They want to be the
[1:29:07] one that prophesies because those are
[1:29:08] the ones that get the notoriety, you
[1:29:11] know, and the gifts of the spirit.
[1:29:13] outside of the ministry, the five-fold
[1:29:15] ministry, you got the the the uh tongues
[1:29:19] and interpretation and prophecy and
[1:29:22] things like that. And everybody wants to
[1:29:23] be that, you know, want wants to be that
[1:29:25] prophecy. And you see that in the in the
[1:29:27] natural world today in in the nominal
[1:29:30] Christian world. Everybody, all these
[1:29:32] people out prophesying all the time,
[1:29:34] right, about all these things. And you
[1:29:36] know
[1:29:38] some things can be uh simply predicted
[1:29:41] upon uh and when and when these things
[1:29:44] don't happen uh that they prophesied and
[1:29:48] these things don't come to pass. It just
[1:29:51] gets forgotten, right? Nobody brings it
[1:29:53] up. Nobody says, "Well, you but you said
[1:29:57] this was going to happen. It didn't
[1:29:58] happen." Then nobody cares. It's not
[1:30:02] it's not broke. And the next thing you
[1:30:04] know, they're prophesying about this
[1:30:06] thing, right? And they're prophesying
[1:30:07] about that thing.
[1:30:10] Amen. It's like when that uh uh uh
[1:30:15] oh, what was the name in California and
[1:30:18] that sister was going to die. God said
[1:30:19] she was going to die. Um Deus Sharen,
[1:30:24] Sister Shakaren's sister, I think, or
[1:30:26] something. She was going to die. And
[1:30:28] brother Ram, God told Brother Ram she's
[1:30:30] going to die. And in service all these
[1:30:32] people are getting up saying sister thou
[1:30:34] shalt live sister God is with you sister
[1:30:36] all and prophesying these things she you
[1:30:39] shall not die and prophesying all these
[1:30:42] things and and I think it was maybe it
[1:30:44] was Billy that came and told brother
[1:30:46] Brandham said Billy Paul told brother
[1:30:48] Brandham said brother daddy said all
[1:30:50] these people they're out here
[1:30:51] prophesying and saying things I I can't
[1:30:53] say what that I can only say what God
[1:30:55] told me right I have no responsibility
[1:30:59] to what anybody else has saying, "All I
[1:31:01] can know is what God told me." And God
[1:31:04] told me he's going to take her, right?
[1:31:06] Period. And then when God does it, all
[1:31:10] the people that lied
[1:31:13] in prophecy because she did die, they
[1:31:16] blame Brother
[1:31:19] because he said she was going to die.
[1:31:21] Like it's his fault, right? when all
[1:31:24] when he was the only one that actually
[1:31:26] told the truth, right? He was actually
[1:31:29] the only one that had God with him,
[1:31:32] right? And everybody else gets mad
[1:31:34] because she died
[1:31:36] instead of being mad at the people that
[1:31:39] of the uh prophecies of the devil, I'll
[1:31:42] just say because it was against God's
[1:31:44] word.
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:47] Why? Why get mad at Brother Brandham?
[1:31:49] Right. Amen. But that's that's humanity.
[1:31:53] That's that that's that's people. It's
[1:31:57] just it's just amazing how people are.
[1:31:59] I'll close here in a few minutes. Let's
[1:32:01] go to Matthew chapter 17. Amen.
[1:32:07] Matthew chapter 17.
[1:32:10] Read uh about Jesus adoption. Amen.
[1:32:14] About Jesus placement. Amen. We know
[1:32:18] Jesus was baptized over in Matthew 3. Uh
[1:32:22] John the Baptist,
[1:32:25] John saw him coming, said, "I I should
[1:32:27] be baptized for of you." And Jesus
[1:32:30] basically like, "Well, yeah, that's
[1:32:32] true. You really should. But we are here
[1:32:34] to fulfill all righteousness, the word.
[1:32:38] We are here to fulfill the word of God."
[1:32:40] Yes. And the sacrifice which I am is to
[1:32:44] be washed in the Old Testament before it
[1:32:48] is sacrificed. Amen. And that is true.
[1:32:51] So we are here. It behooves us to
[1:32:53] fulfill all righteousness. So John
[1:32:56] suffered him and baptized him. John
[1:33:00] Jesus baptized. We know he came out of
[1:33:02] the water and the spirit of God, the
[1:33:03] spirit of God, the spirit of God came on
[1:33:08] him in the form of a dove.
[1:33:10] Amen. We know that God was with him. God
[1:33:13] led him. God guided him even when he was
[1:33:15] a little boy. We know that his mother
[1:33:19] that gone along the way and uh Mary well
[1:33:22] he wasn't it wasn't his mother or it's
[1:33:24] called his guardian maybe. Amen. The one
[1:33:27] that the the woman that birthed him
[1:33:29] forth. Amen. Uh Mary finally realized at
[1:33:34] some point that Jesus was not with him.
[1:33:37] I wish a lot of people would realize
[1:33:38] that today.
[1:33:40] I it it would it would it would make me
[1:33:43] so happy that people would come to the
[1:33:44] realization that God wasn't with them,
[1:33:47] right? That that would be the greatest
[1:33:49] revelation a human could get. But she
[1:33:51] realized that God wasn't with him. She
[1:33:53] realized their child wasn't with him.
[1:33:55] Said, "Where did he go?" They went back
[1:33:57] to find him. Amen. What was his immortal
[1:34:00] words? I must be about my father's
[1:34:04] business. Amen. Praise the Lord. And he
[1:34:07] hadn't even been adopted yet, but he
[1:34:10] still had to be led of the Holy Spirit.
[1:34:13] Amen. When he come to this place,
[1:34:15] Matthew 17, when God adopted him finally
[1:34:19] in the positionally placement of it,
[1:34:22] realized and said to the rest of the
[1:34:24] world with witnesses, Amen. that this
[1:34:28] was his son. Yes. Hear him. Amen. Hear
[1:34:32] him. Praise the Lord. We've talked about
[1:34:35] that in in businesses, companies like
[1:34:37] that. When a man starts a company or
[1:34:39] business and he runs that business and
[1:34:41] he runs it the way he wants to, the way
[1:34:42] he thinks it should be run, it's a
[1:34:44] successful business and is doing great
[1:34:46] and he has a son that's coming up. Uh,
[1:34:48] and he wants that son to follow in his
[1:34:51] footsteps. He wants him to take over
[1:34:53] that business and become that become
[1:34:55] that man to keep that business going and
[1:34:58] to keep those people employed and to
[1:35:00] keep people with jobs and and and to
[1:35:02] make sure that people have ways to
[1:35:04] provide for their families and stuff to
[1:35:06] keep that as a viable company. So he
[1:35:08] wants his son to follow in his
[1:35:10] footsteps, not be his daddy, right? But
[1:35:13] follow in the footsteps of of uh of him
[1:35:18] in in that company. But now we in
[1:35:20] ourselves, our desire is is to follow in
[1:35:25] his footsteps. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:30] And be like him. Yes. Amen. Yes. Now, a
[1:35:35] son might come up and say, "Well, I know
[1:35:37] dad did a great job, but I'm going to
[1:35:39] tweak this here, and I'm going to tweak
[1:35:40] that there. I'm not my daddy." And and
[1:35:43] it's and it's a success. It's still a
[1:35:46] great business. It may even be more
[1:35:49] successful, but he wasn't his daddy. No,
[1:35:51] no, no. This plan is absolutely perfect.
[1:35:56] This business cannot be improved upon,
[1:36:00] if you will. Excuse the car and per uh
[1:36:03] uh comparison there. Uh it cannot be
[1:36:06] improved on. God's plan cannot be
[1:36:08] improved on. That's right. So, our whole
[1:36:11] desire is to become like him. Amen.
[1:36:14] Praise the Lord. Yes.
[1:36:17] You know, the Catholics got a lot of
[1:36:18] things carnal impersonated, but they got
[1:36:21] them right when they talk about the
[1:36:24] Viker of Christ
[1:36:26] there instead of Christ. Right. Amen.
[1:36:30] What did Brother Random say? That there
[1:36:33] would come a time where this bride that
[1:36:34] would get to the place of you personally
[1:36:37] that God would be pleased to honor your
[1:36:39] word.
[1:36:42] Your word. That's right. Praise the
[1:36:44] Lord. Help us, Lord. Amen.
[1:36:47] I'm not taking his place, but I'm in the
[1:36:50] position God put me in to continue on.
[1:36:54] Amen. Amen. I'm not changing anything.
[1:36:57] I'm not going to tweak a word here or
[1:36:58] change a word there or uh uh differ a
[1:37:01] meaning of this over here. I want it to
[1:37:03] be this plan is absolutely perfect,
[1:37:07] right? And needs no additions. It needs
[1:37:09] no subtractions. And it needs no
[1:37:11] changes. Amen. Amen. Heaven and earth
[1:37:14] will pass away, but my word cannot
[1:37:16] change or pass away, which that word's
[1:37:19] the same. Cannot change. Amen. Praise
[1:37:22] the Lord. So God sends him, we haven't
[1:37:25] read, have we? Matthew 17. And after six
[1:37:28] days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and
[1:37:29] John his brethren, bringeth them up into
[1:37:31] a high mountain apart, and was
[1:37:33] transfigured before them. Transfigured.
[1:37:38] Amen. In the mount of transfiguration.
[1:37:42] and was transfigured before them. And
[1:37:43] his face did shine as the sun, and his
[1:37:45] raignment was white as the light.
[1:37:49] And behold, there appeared unto them
[1:37:51] Moses and Elijah talking with them.
[1:37:54] There you see the dead raised and the
[1:37:57] transfiguration,
[1:37:59] the the the the representation of the
[1:38:01] dead raised and the rapture, right?
[1:38:04] Amen. Amen. Uh talking with them. then
[1:38:07] answered Peter and said unto him uh said
[1:38:09] unto Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to
[1:38:12] be here. If thou wilt now recognize and
[1:38:15] remember now he's in this beautiful
[1:38:17] sacred place in this of ceremony taking
[1:38:22] place of adoption of Jesus that God's
[1:38:24] placing him now, but understanding
[1:38:27] though now that Peter has yet to be born
[1:38:29] again.
[1:38:31] Peter was chosen of God, but he has not
[1:38:34] received the Holy Ghost at this point."
[1:38:36] Right? So Jesus of Jesus, Lord, it is
[1:38:40] good for us to be here. If thou wilt,
[1:38:42] let us make here three tabernacles, one
[1:38:45] for thee, one for Moses, one for Elias.
[1:38:48] Think that would be a very carnal thing
[1:38:50] to do. While he yet spake, behold, a
[1:38:53] bright cloud overshadowed them. And
[1:38:55] behold, a voice out of the cloud, which
[1:38:57] said, "This is my beloved son in whom I
[1:39:01] am well pleased. Hear ye him."
[1:39:05] Praise the Lord. Hear ye him. Now that's
[1:39:09] his position now. Hear him. And when the
[1:39:12] disciples heard it, they fell on their
[1:39:14] faces and were sore afraid. And Jesus
[1:39:16] came and touched them and said, "Arise,
[1:39:19] be not afraid. And when he had laid when
[1:39:21] he had lifted up their eyes, when they
[1:39:23] had lifted up, they saw no man save
[1:39:25] Jesus only." Amen. And as they came down
[1:39:28] from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
[1:39:30] saying, uh, tell no, tell the vision to
[1:39:32] no man until the son of man be risen
[1:39:35] again from the dead. God placing his son
[1:39:38] now. God placing Jesus. Now God said,
[1:39:42] now hear ye him. He is my mouthpiece. He
[1:39:46] is my representative. He is the one here
[1:39:48] now on this earth at this time that is
[1:39:51] that is taking my place.
[1:39:55] Hear him now. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:58] He's the one that's in charge. He's the
[1:40:00] one that you listen to. He's the one
[1:40:02] that you uh uh take instruction from.
[1:40:06] Amen.
[1:40:09] Remember, hear ye him.
[1:40:11] 1960. Brother Baron said, "Now you see
[1:40:13] Jesus had proven to God that he had been
[1:40:16] the right kind of a son." Amen. I hope
[1:40:19] we do that. Hope I do that. God took him
[1:40:22] up on the mountain, top of the mountain,
[1:40:25] brought witnesses out there, heavenly
[1:40:27] witnesses and earthly witnesses, and he
[1:40:29] clothed him in immortality.
[1:40:32] And they looked up and said, "His
[1:40:34] garments shine like the sun." A
[1:40:35] supernatural something taking place, his
[1:40:38] garments glistening like the sun in the
[1:40:40] middle of the day as uh as white as it
[1:40:43] could be.
[1:40:44] God placed on him that robe of
[1:40:46] immortality, showing that he had
[1:40:48] received him. that that's the thing that
[1:40:52] God will do to his sons here on earth
[1:40:55] someday. He will call you aside, church,
[1:40:59] if you'll only obey him and stay on the
[1:41:02] word and believe it. And he will place
[1:41:04] into that church before the coming of
[1:41:06] Christ.
[1:41:08] Praise Praise the Lord. He will place
[1:41:10] into the church all the power that
[1:41:14] Christ had in him will be in the church.
[1:41:17] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:19] You believe that? Yes. Not for somebody
[1:41:22] else, right? It's for you.
[1:41:26] Everyone that's a part of that body is a
[1:41:28] part of that promise. And if we're all a
[1:41:31] part of that body, then we're all a part
[1:41:33] of that promise. And the promise is it
[1:41:35] is unto you. It is unto your children.
[1:41:39] It is unto them as far off as many even
[1:41:42] as the Lord our God will call. Amen.
[1:41:45] Now, that's the promise. Do we receive
[1:41:48] it?
[1:41:49] Amen. Because that's his promise to me.
[1:41:52] I want to receive that and be that
[1:41:55] promise to be that mouthpiece. Amen.
[1:41:58] Amen. To be that mouthpiece. Now it's up
[1:42:01] to you. It's up to us.
[1:42:05] All the powers that Christ had with him
[1:42:08] will be in the church. All that God was,
[1:42:10] he poured into Jesus. All that Jesus
[1:42:12] was, he's poured into the bride. God
[1:42:15] wanting his work done, he sent it into
[1:42:18] his son. The son wanting the work to be
[1:42:21] done, sent it into his bride.
[1:42:24] Praise God. At that day, you'll know
[1:42:26] that I am in the father, father and me,
[1:42:28] and I in you and you and me at that day.
[1:42:30] Because the same power of God was in
[1:42:32] Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ. Is
[1:42:35] the same power that rested in Jesus
[1:42:37] Christ. Now rest in place in the son in
[1:42:41] the sons in the body of Christ. Amen. We
[1:42:45] are the body of Christ. Amen. Those of
[1:42:48] whom God has placed that in. Amen. Now,
[1:42:51] it's our position. It's our time. It's
[1:42:54] our place. It's our responsibility to
[1:42:57] fulfill that promise that God has called
[1:42:59] us to. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:03] Yes. What where God has adopted us and
[1:43:06] placed us. Amen. I've posed this
[1:43:10] question before. I don't know. It's not
[1:43:12] up to me to say. Amen. But was that
[1:43:17] ceremony for brother Brandham at Sunset
[1:43:20] Mountain for people? I don't know.
[1:43:23] That's up to him. He's He's his own
[1:43:26] person. He's his own individual. Maybe.
[1:43:29] Was it? I don't know. Amen. I wouldn't
[1:43:32] say it was. Amen. Because I don't know.
[1:43:35] I have I have no way of knowing unless
[1:43:37] God reveals something to me or
[1:43:39] something. Brother Brandham never said
[1:43:40] that that I've ever read. Amen. Could it
[1:43:44] be? I don't know. I just know who his
[1:43:48] who he was and what his position and
[1:43:50] placement was in this body for this
[1:43:52] time. Right. Amen. And thank God we
[1:43:55] still have food that was stored up in
[1:43:56] the storehouse for us to be able to
[1:43:58] listen to and read and still go by
[1:44:01] through the scripture. Because God's
[1:44:04] left it for us to have. God has left it
[1:44:06] for us to eat on, to feast on. Amen.
[1:44:09] Praise the Lord. Now it's ours to be
[1:44:11] adop adopted Christ. Yes. Look at that.
[1:44:14] Think, brother Brown. Yes. What what
[1:44:17] what this this person or this minister,
[1:44:19] this people, this but what about you?
[1:44:21] What about us? Amen. Praise the Lord. We
[1:44:25] continue to live and go on. You say,
[1:44:27] "Well, why didn't uh why didn't brother
[1:44:30] why didn't God adopt Christ in in this
[1:44:33] ceremony like this when he was the
[1:44:35] 12-year-old boy that was going about his
[1:44:36] father's business?
[1:44:39] Wasn't the time."
[1:44:41] Amen. Wasn't his time. God wanted to
[1:44:43] make sure
[1:44:45] that he could trust him and he was
[1:44:47] following the leading his leading
[1:44:50] and being led by the spirit by being led
[1:44:52] by God.
[1:44:54] When he proved himself, which we went
[1:44:57] through like the first few portions of
[1:45:00] this subject. When he proved that then
[1:45:03] God knew then he could trust.
[1:45:06] How can he trust us? Amen. I pray I pray
[1:45:11] and believe and trust he can trust us.
[1:45:14] Amen. He comes to that place. You say
[1:45:18] those that he has entrusted some he will
[1:45:21] give more entrustment to. Yes. Amen.
[1:45:24] Story of the talents and Amen. You you
[1:45:28] you were good and faithful. Amen. Now
[1:45:31] I'll give you more and trust you with
[1:45:32] more with what what I I need you to do.
[1:45:37] Amen. God wants us to do. And we want to
[1:45:40] be and we want to be that that God
[1:45:43] fulfills through us. Amen. Amen.
[1:45:47] Fulfills through us. Amen. Let's stand
[1:45:49] if we could. Amen.
[1:45:55] There's a couple other points to that
[1:45:57] that I wanted to make, but that's just
[1:45:58] going to take a bit longer. We'll grab
[1:46:00] that. We we'll pick that up, Lord
[1:46:02] willing, next week um and next service
[1:46:06] time and um we'll we'll finish it off
[1:46:09] from there. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:13] Amen. Let's be what God wants us to be.
[1:46:17] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.

[1:46:24] to find it. You bear with me just a
[1:46:26] second.
[1:46:28] Amen.
[1:46:30] Sometimes I I know the proximity of
[1:46:33] where a song is, but I don't know
[1:46:34] exactly the number and sometimes don't
[1:46:36] know the name. Amen.
[1:46:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:43] Well,
[1:46:45] can't find it. Let's just sing. Here it
[1:46:46] is. 617. The chorus. More of you.

[1:48:40] Oh one more time now. Yes. more of you.

[1:48:54] I've had it all, but what I need is more
[1:49:01] of you.
[1:49:05] of things I've had my fear
[1:49:11] and yet I hunger
[1:49:15] still
[1:49:18] empty and bare.
[1:49:21] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[1:49:29] Yes, Jesus.
[1:49:31] Amen. More and more of you, Lord. That's
[1:49:34] what we need. Praise the Lord Jesus. We
[1:49:37] need, we want, we desire more and more
[1:49:40] of him. Hallelujah. Oh, grant it to us,
[1:49:44] Lord, today. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:46] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. That's your
[1:49:49] desire. Yes. More of God. Be more like
[1:49:53] God. Amen. Be formed into his image.
[1:49:58] Speak only when he says speak. Amen. Go
[1:50:01] where he says go. Yes. Amen. By his

[1:50:15] today. Amen. Pray with something was
[1:50:18] blessed. Said to bless his strength in
[1:50:20] the Lord today. Yes, he is God. He is
[1:50:23] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:50:25] Amen. And blessed be his holy name.
[1:50:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[1:50:30] richly. Appreciate each one being here.
[1:50:32] If you're watching, God bless you.
[1:50:34] You're still there. Amen. And just thank
[1:50:36] the Lord for his goodness to us. Amen.
[1:50:39] Appreciate
[1:50:40] last week. Um
[1:50:43] moving the service time. I probably were
[1:50:46] supposed to go to Houston next week and
[1:50:49] uh it more than likely I thought
[1:50:52] Southwest or Houston uh United had good
[1:50:56] flight non-stop flight times, but they
[1:50:59] don't anymore from here. I don't know
[1:51:01] why. So, uh, the flight won't be as
[1:51:04] early as next week, but I'll probably
[1:51:05] still have to move the service time up
[1:51:07] again, uh, to 10:00. I hope that's okay.
[1:51:11] I'll, uh, text everyone, uh, again, like
[1:51:14] I normally do to make sure everybody
[1:51:16] gets the message, uh, to know that
[1:51:19] service will be 10:00, but if it, after
[1:51:22] looking at the schedule, if it goes the
[1:51:23] way it looks like, um, then I'll
[1:51:26] probably have to go a little earlier
[1:51:27] again uh, next week. So, appreciate your
[1:51:31] understanding and seeing that it's going
[1:51:33] to be hot and humid in Houston.
[1:51:37] Uh Houston is just it's almost as bad as
[1:51:41] Florida sometimes. Uh the humidity will
[1:51:44] raise the temperature like 10 degrees.
[1:51:47] So even if it's like 92, the humidity
[1:51:50] will make it feel like 102. Uh but
[1:51:53] anyway, the Lord is always good. Yes.
[1:51:56] Amen. He always brings me through it and
[1:51:59] helps us to do it. So, amen. That's
[1:52:02] that's what we care. He never said it
[1:52:03] was going to be easy. Amen. For any of
[1:52:06] us. Praise. He just said, "I'll be with
[1:52:08] you." Amen. And I believe that. So So

[1:52:35] And we'll be dismissed in a word of
[1:52:36] prayer. Thank you all for coming and
[1:52:38] being here today.
[1:52:43] Gracious father, Lord God, we
[1:52:46] at the services we have before. Thank
[1:52:49] you for everything you've done for us
[1:52:51] both through the week previous through
[1:52:53] the service and being with us and
[1:52:55] allowing us to feel your presence and
[1:52:57] your anointing through the songs. Amen.
[1:52:59] Jesus. Yes. God may help us as we go our
[1:53:01] separate ways whatever we may do today
[1:53:03] and this week that you carry you with us
[1:53:06] and that
[1:53:08] spoken today that we' be just writ.
[1:53:11] Amen. Amen. Yes, Lord. Those of us that
[1:53:13] may look a little more like the world,
[1:53:15] just wearing pants, shirts as men, Lord
[1:53:18] Jesus, but there's something about us
[1:53:19] that people can tell that that we're
[1:53:21] different, Lord God. Amen. If the door
[1:53:22] should open that we can say something
[1:53:24] about you and bring someone in, Lord,
[1:53:27] grant it, God. Allow us that
[1:53:29] opportunity. Lord, we thank you for
[1:53:31] everything and once again commit
[1:53:33] ourselves into your hands. Always keep
[1:53:35] us safe. In Jesus Christ's name we ask.
[1:53:38] Amen. God richly bless you today. Heat.
