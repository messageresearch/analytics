[25:28] is selena and
[25:29] her mom so javi's girlfriend and her
[25:31] mother um
[25:34] so they both came up with uh positive
[25:36] covet
[25:38] test results uh earlier this week or

[25:41] so i want to remember them and sister
[25:44] shariah

[26:13] woke up with a scratchy throat and cough
[26:15] hoping it's just the allergies and you
[26:17] know that's why she
[26:18] didn't want to come in today just in
[26:19] case you know she doesn't want to
[26:22] affect anyone else if she has anything
[26:24] and also uh praise

[28:15] drifting in and out of consciousness and
[28:17] she's been in the er
[28:18] all night trying to figure out what
[28:19] happened because spinal taps on her
[28:22] ct scans and now she's getting uh i
[28:25] think
[28:27] it's to check your brain to make sure

[28:31] she's only like 12 or 13 years old
[28:34] what's her name

[28:49] what's wrong with her they think she may
[28:50] have had a seizure

[35:00] sister monica that he
[35:02] wasn't able to come i didn't want them
[35:05] to take offense
[35:06] i thought brother roger was gonna preach
[35:08] but i was
[35:10] seriously hurting and she said they
[35:12] would pray for me too and you know
[35:15] monday i was so much better tuesday it

[36:26] hey man anyone else have a testimony yes
[36:28] brother dance

[36:31] ago i don't even think i told my brother
[36:33] i was helping my wife uh hang a curtain
[36:37] kitchen window and i i needed just a
[36:40] little bit more height
[36:42] and i got the little step stool
[36:45] and all of a sudden i slipped and i went
[36:48] crooked and i hit the edge of the
[36:50] counter and
[36:52] and my wife heard the noise she ran
[36:54] downstairs
[36:56] and i should have been on the floor
[36:59] but i stood up and she said what
[37:02] happened
[37:03] i said i fell off that step and i i i
[37:06] thought i was going to really be on the
[37:08] ground but i
[37:09] i give glory to the lord amen and send
[37:13] his angels
[37:14] and it could have been a lot worse the
[37:16] way it sounded it should have been a lot
[37:18] worse than what it was
[37:19] and give the glory to the lord amen
[37:27] yes i was able to go and be with my
[37:29] family over the
[37:30] uh christmas holiday now i'd stayed with
[37:33] my sister
[37:34] and um god had been letting me see
[37:37] numbers
[37:38] uh i don't know for the last
[37:41] 10 years the number 33 you know on the
[37:43] clock you see these numbers
[37:45] i see five five five or eleven eleven
[37:48] four four four three three three but
[37:50] mostly
[37:50] uh 33 because he knew that it reminds me
[37:53] of the lord you know
[37:55] that right was crucified
[37:59] and so it reminds me of him you know to
[38:01] thank him and so forth and just say i
[38:03] appreciate you lord just reminding of
[38:04] god
[38:05] yes and he's let me see that so often am
[38:08] i so i mean with other brothers even you
[38:10] know we're sitting in the church
[38:11] and we're or or we're out at lunch or
[38:13] whatever it is you know this has been
[38:15] happening

[38:34] same
[38:35] thing or i'm listening to a tape at home
[38:38] the minister says the same thing you
[38:40] know what i mean
[38:41] uh so i appreciate that i mean you know

[1:04:26] are saying and they know that jesus was
[1:04:28] not born in december
[1:04:30] took them long enough but apparently
[1:04:31] they're finally coming to understanding
[1:04:33] it wasn't
[1:04:33] december jesus was born in he was born
[1:04:36] in the springtime when all lambs come
[1:04:38] forth he was the lamb
[1:04:39] is born in the springtime when all lambs
[1:04:41] come forth you say well what's this got
[1:04:43] to do
[1:04:43] with the birth of jesus and i think well
[1:04:46] you know we celebrate the birth of jesus
[1:04:48] if you celebrate the birth of jesus as a
[1:04:51] celebratory time
[1:04:53] life is life as it is and we in
[1:04:56] ourselves have life and
[1:04:57] we celebrate our lives every day of
[1:05:00] course
[1:05:00] we celebrate the life of jesus in us
[1:05:03] every day amen so that celebration is an
[1:05:05] everyday event but there's
[1:05:07] that one day that we set aside that
[1:05:09] normally we know
[1:05:11] what day we were born on you get a cake
[1:05:13] and you have presents and you get
[1:05:14] together and
[1:05:15] go to dinner maybe or different things
[1:05:17] because you celebrate well that was the
[1:05:18] day that person was born
[1:05:20] but we don't know that with jesus
[1:05:22] brother brown says april may we know
[1:05:24] springtime
[1:05:25] and i think about it like this and i
[1:05:28] told this to you a couple weeks ago but
[1:05:29] you know we don't know my wife doesn't
[1:05:31] know when she was born
[1:05:33] she picked her birthday uh she can tell
[1:05:35] you all the details of why she picked
[1:05:37] july 10th but we don't know we got a one
[1:05:39] in 365 chance
[1:05:41] of getting it correct but we don't know
[1:05:43] but we celebrate it on that day
[1:05:46] i understand so we take that time and we
[1:05:48] make that celebration because it's that
[1:05:50] one day
[1:05:51] we don't know what day it is but we take
[1:05:53] that day
[1:05:54] and we celebrate we celebrate the birth
[1:05:56] of jesus
[1:05:57] now don't believe in the worldism and
[1:05:59] the commercialism and
[1:06:01] trees and all that stuff but we do
[1:06:03] believe and are thankful for the birth
[1:06:05] of jesus
[1:06:06] so uh as we go into this uh
[1:06:09] portion of the scripture i'm hoping to
[1:06:12] try to finish this today but without
[1:06:14] keeping it too long
[1:06:16] but i want to start back again in
[1:06:18] genesis
[1:06:19] 3 21 and i'm going to read through and
[1:06:22] just follow with me here and
[1:06:23] and we'll just uh we'll just take this
[1:06:25] and jump start us into the subject that
[1:06:27] i want to talk about today unto adam
[1:06:29] also unto his wife did the lord god make
[1:06:32] coats of skins
[1:06:34] and clothe them so we know there in the
[1:06:36] garden of eden as adam and eve were
[1:06:37] hiding themselves from god
[1:06:39] they had created a buffer they like to
[1:06:42] use the bible says the word hide
[1:06:44] you can't hide from god so we know they
[1:06:47] couldn't hide from god
[1:06:49] but they created a buffer because they
[1:06:51] were in a condition now that was a
[1:06:53] falling condition
[1:06:54] and this fallen condition did not allow
[1:06:56] them to be in the presence of god they
[1:06:58] could not do that anymore
[1:07:00] god used to come every day and talk to
[1:07:02] adam lift to ear and they'd fellowship
[1:07:04] walk through the garden of eden and then
[1:07:05] have a wonderful time of fellowship
[1:07:07] together but then
[1:07:08] but when the fall took place and sin
[1:07:10] entered in the camp
[1:07:11] they could no longer be in god's
[1:07:13] presence like that so they created that
[1:07:15] buffer
[1:07:16] they hid in the bushes and the trees and
[1:07:18] separated themselves from god they
[1:07:20] created a buffer there
[1:07:22] but when god realized this he made the
[1:07:24] decision
[1:07:26] now this you say god make a decision
[1:07:28] well every decision god made has been
[1:07:30] right it's been perfect
[1:07:31] and it's been uh a final
[1:07:34] for for all eternity god decided that it
[1:07:37] would take the
[1:07:39] shed blood of an innocent one to allow
[1:07:41] them to come back into his presence
[1:07:43] again
[1:07:44] not like it was before but acceptable
[1:07:46] enough to god that they could be there
[1:07:48] with him
[1:07:49] at that time amen now that sin through
[1:07:52] the great
[1:07:52] chasm that great uh a gulf between god
[1:07:56] and man
[1:07:57] the sin entered now god because god
[1:08:00] can't dwell with their sin
[1:08:01] so that sin chasm threw a great
[1:08:04] gulf between god and man so they could
[1:08:06] not at that time
[1:08:08] have that kind of fellowship anymore so
[1:08:10] god in his
[1:08:11] uh of course godness uh through
[1:08:15] the wisdom of taking blood
[1:08:18] the breaking of a blood cell a lot of
[1:08:21] times you
[1:08:21] talk about in denomination and you sing
[1:08:24] about it and people look at blood and
[1:08:25] the flowing of the blood but it wasn't
[1:08:27] the chemistry of the blood that made the
[1:08:29] difference it was the life that was
[1:08:32] in the blood that made the difference
[1:08:34] the chemistry of the blood would have
[1:08:36] fallen onto the earth or onto an
[1:08:38] altar or wherever and that was one part
[1:08:40] of it but it was the life that was in
[1:08:42] the blood that was
[1:08:43] recognized by god not the actual drip of
[1:08:46] chemistry of blood
[1:08:48] now that played its part of course too
[1:08:50] but the life in the blood is what god
[1:08:52] recognized amen and when that blood cell
[1:08:54] was broke that was something that was
[1:08:56] acceptable to god an
[1:08:57] innocent lamb in this case took the
[1:09:00] place of what adam and eve had done
[1:09:03] now it wasn't enough to annihilate it
[1:09:05] because it was simply an animal's blood
[1:09:07] but it was enough to cover it so that it
[1:09:10] would take them to the next time
[1:09:12] just like through the old testament the
[1:09:15] the blood of the bulls and the goats and
[1:09:17] the lambs that never eliminated or
[1:09:18] annihilated their sin
[1:09:20] but it hid their sin to where it made it
[1:09:23] acceptable
[1:09:23] by god that was god's choice no man
[1:09:27] chose that no no person no church
[1:09:31] no pope no entity no pastor it was god's
[1:09:34] decision that it was going to take
[1:09:36] blood in the blood of an innocent one
[1:09:37] that was his choice so he took these
[1:09:40] uh these lambs and he made coats of
[1:09:42] skins out of these lambs
[1:09:44] for adam and eve he threw these bloody
[1:09:46] sheepskin
[1:09:47] into the bush for them to wear to come
[1:09:49] out again but then god had to banish
[1:09:51] them from the garden of eden because of
[1:09:53] the sin
[1:09:54] right now let's continue on and the lord
[1:09:56] god said behold the man has come as
[1:09:58] become as one of us to know good and
[1:10:00] evil
[1:10:01] and now lest he put forth his hand and
[1:10:03] take also the tree of life and eat and
[1:10:05] live forever
[1:10:06] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[1:10:08] from the garden of eden to till the
[1:10:09] ground from which he was taken
[1:10:11] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[1:10:13] the east of the garden
[1:10:15] the garden of eden cherubims with a
[1:10:17] flaming sword which turned every way to
[1:10:20] keep the way of the tree of life that's
[1:10:22] a whole another message or two or ten
[1:10:23] in itself but i want to say on our
[1:10:25] subject today
[1:10:27] and adam knew his wife and she conceived
[1:10:29] and bear cain
[1:10:31] and salah had gotten a man from the lord
[1:10:34] and she again bear his brother abel and
[1:10:36] abel was a
[1:10:38] and she again bear his brother abel and
[1:10:41] abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was
[1:10:43] the tiller of the ground
[1:10:44] in the process of time it came to pass
[1:10:46] that cain brought of the first
[1:10:48] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[1:10:50] unto the lord and abel
[1:10:52] he also brought of the first thing of
[1:10:54] his flock and of the fat thereof and the
[1:10:56] lord had respect
[1:10:58] unto abel and to his offering but unto
[1:11:01] cain unto his offering he had not
[1:11:03] respect
[1:11:04] and cain was very wroth and his
[1:11:06] countenance fell
[1:11:08] now these sacrifices were reminiscent
[1:11:11] of what god had done for adam and eve in
[1:11:13] the garden of eden
[1:11:14] these sacrifices that of course revel
[1:11:17] matthew
[1:11:18] excuse me hebrews tells us that by faith
[1:11:21] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[1:11:24] sacrifice than cain
[1:11:25] why was it a more excellent sacrifice
[1:11:28] because the sacrifice that
[1:11:30] abel gave was by revelation right the
[1:11:33] sacrifice he gave was that was by faith
[1:11:36] and this faith this revelation that was
[1:11:39] in abel
[1:11:39] came not through the serpent seed but
[1:11:42] from god
[1:11:42] through adam because it was adam's need
[1:11:45] of abel
[1:11:46] that had the revelation that knew that
[1:11:49] when the garden of eden
[1:11:50] when god decided that it would take
[1:11:52] blood or the blood of an innocent one
[1:11:54] to satisfy or to accomplish what god was
[1:11:58] expecting to have for that time
[1:12:00] when abel got that revelation he used
[1:12:03] that revelation
[1:12:04] to offer his sacrifice to god because he
[1:12:07] knew that's what was acceptable to god
[1:12:09] it wasn't botany life it wasn't fruits
[1:12:12] it wasn't
[1:12:12] uh leaves it wasn't fig leaves it wasn't
[1:12:15] apricots it wasn't
[1:12:17] apples it wasn't oranges it was blood
[1:12:21] that's what was acceptable to god it
[1:12:23] took blood
[1:12:24] and abel offered a more excellent
[1:12:26] sacrifice
[1:12:27] by faith by revelation to god
[1:12:30] and this was acceptable to god he did
[1:12:33] not accept
[1:12:34] cain's sacrifice because cain's
[1:12:36] sacrifice
[1:12:37] had no revelation to it it only had
[1:12:40] human intellectual knowledge now
[1:12:43] everything about the altar and
[1:12:44] everything they did was exactly the same
[1:12:46] it was right it was acceptable
[1:12:48] but that's not what god's looking for
[1:12:50] this church this building
[1:12:52] all the the the cameras and the
[1:12:54] musicians and the singing and the chairs
[1:12:56] that's all wonderful and great we got it
[1:12:58] all set up nice friend
[1:12:59] but that's not what brings revelation
[1:13:02] that's what's not acceptable to
[1:13:04] god the chairs are fine friend the the
[1:13:07] the pulpit i love it i think
[1:13:09] daniel every day i think uh uh for
[1:13:11] making this pulpit and
[1:13:13] and the streaming the instruments and
[1:13:14] singing the book god blesses us
[1:13:17] but that's not where he's at that's
[1:13:19] right god is in revelation
[1:13:21] it's revelation that god's looking for
[1:13:23] it's in your heart by the holy spirit
[1:13:26] that god brings it to you that he
[1:13:28] accepts that sacrifice
[1:13:30] the sacrifice that we offer to him
[1:13:33] giving him
[1:13:33] praise with the fruit of our lips that's
[1:13:36] what acceptable to god all this
[1:13:39] could be out on the street corner all
[1:13:40] this could be in a homeless shelter all
[1:13:43] this
[1:13:43] could be in a a an extended care
[1:13:46] facility it could be anywhere
[1:13:48] it could be any chairs it could be any
[1:13:50] books
[1:13:51] it could be any music it could be any
[1:13:53] singing but it has to be with revelation
[1:13:57] it's got to be by faith it's got to be
[1:13:59] by the holy spirit that it offers unto
[1:14:02] god
[1:14:02] that's the more excellent sacrifice all
[1:14:05] the
[1:14:06] altering things that cain did all that
[1:14:08] was fine
[1:14:10] that that would god god that that's okay
[1:14:12] that's fine it could be here it could be
[1:14:14] all the uh all the religious move that
[1:14:16] cain did
[1:14:18] that was all perfectly fine but it was
[1:14:20] the sacrifice
[1:14:22] is what god was looking at the sacrifice
[1:14:25] he wasn't concerned with the altar the
[1:14:26] altar was one thing it needed to be done
[1:14:28] right of course
[1:14:29] but it was the sacrifice that god was
[1:14:32] concerned with
[1:14:33] and the sacrifice is what god's
[1:14:35] concerned with today
[1:14:37] it's not everything else all that's fine
[1:14:39] this is all acceptable to god
[1:14:41] he's pleased with it but it's the
[1:14:43] sacrifice that god's looking for
[1:14:45] it's the offering unto him by revelation
[1:14:48] and faith that we give
[1:14:49] that's acceptable to god amen he he did
[1:14:52] not accept cain's sacrifice
[1:14:55] but he did accept abel's sacrifice now
[1:14:57] people say well king was sincere
[1:15:00] absolutely it was sincere there's a lot
[1:15:02] of people out in the world today
[1:15:04] they're in churches all over the world
[1:15:06] they're worshiping hands up
[1:15:08] tears flowing and but they have but
[1:15:10] where is the sincerity
[1:15:12] you think well they're they are sincere
[1:15:14] but is god accepting that
[1:15:16] right is god receiving that is that
[1:15:18] worship
[1:15:19] by revelation is it by faith where is
[1:15:22] that worship what is it that's
[1:15:24] acceptable to god
[1:15:26] well see there's got to be something
[1:15:27] that god will receive
[1:15:29] and the only way we can know what is
[1:15:31] pleasing to the lord is about what the
[1:15:33] word tells us right
[1:15:34] what does the bible say that god is
[1:15:36] pleased with what we know he wasn't
[1:15:38] pleased with kings
[1:15:40] and we know why he wasn't pleased with
[1:15:42] cain's
[1:15:43] but we know he was pleased with abel's
[1:15:45] and we know why he was pleased with
[1:15:47] abel's
[1:15:48] so abel's sacrifice was by faith it was
[1:15:51] by revelation
[1:15:52] he could look back and realize what god
[1:15:55] had done in the garden of eden
[1:15:57] because god had done the exact same
[1:15:59] thing that abel did
[1:16:00] that was accepted by god cain didn't do
[1:16:03] that
[1:16:04] you want to be something that's
[1:16:06] acceptable by god you look at what the
[1:16:07] bible says and what's pleasing to the
[1:16:09] lord
[1:16:10] that's what we do amen that's cain and
[1:16:12] abel's sacrifice
[1:16:14] god made the decision that's what it was
[1:16:17] going to take
[1:16:18] that was god's choice now if that's
[1:16:20] god's choice that's what we follow
[1:16:22] others may follow all different other
[1:16:24] ways of trying to serve the lord right
[1:16:27] or to give to the lord
[1:16:28] and i'm sure they're doing it now the
[1:16:30] sincerity of their heart but if it's not
[1:16:32] by revelation it's not by the word it's
[1:16:34] not going to be acceptable to god
[1:16:36] they can't that the bible says they come
[1:16:38] to him on that day and say well we did
[1:16:40] this for you lord we did that for you
[1:16:41] lord we did this in your name
[1:16:43] we did this in your name jesus and he
[1:16:46] said depart from me i
[1:16:48] never even knew you right that's right
[1:16:50] they were sincere
[1:16:52] of course they were but it's got to take
[1:16:54] a revelation
[1:16:55] right it's got to take a sacrifice
[1:16:58] something that is acceptable by god we
[1:17:01] understand what is acceptable by god
[1:17:05] this was the beginning of a process that
[1:17:08] was to carry on
[1:17:09] even into the birth of jesus even unto
[1:17:11] this day
[1:17:13] that birth of jesus was a continuation
[1:17:17] of what god had started here in the
[1:17:19] garden of eden
[1:17:21] it was just a continuation god took the
[1:17:23] innocent lambs
[1:17:24] and sacrificed them so adam and eve
[1:17:26] could come out and
[1:17:27] to his presence again well jesus the
[1:17:30] birth of jesus was
[1:17:31] just a continuation of that because that
[1:17:33] was the beginning that god was showing
[1:17:35] us
[1:17:36] just just having that just lifting up
[1:17:38] off of that banner
[1:17:40] uh that blanket just a little bit just
[1:17:42] so he could see
[1:17:44] what his purpose was in redemption
[1:17:47] because there had to be something to
[1:17:49] redeem
[1:17:50] bring back adam and eve from where they
[1:17:52] had fallen to
[1:17:54] because see adam and eve and you know i
[1:17:57] i've explained this to you before but
[1:17:59] can i go in just a few minutes
[1:18:01] here because it goes with the subject
[1:18:03] but uh
[1:18:04] but adam and eve were let's just say
[1:18:06] they were right here
[1:18:08] adam was created out of the dust of the
[1:18:10] ground by the voice of god
[1:18:12] amen god spoken that come at them
[1:18:16] right period i believe
[1:18:20] god's way i believe that's how every
[1:18:22] human was supposed to come
[1:18:24] right they weren't supposed to come by
[1:18:26] procreation and birth from a woman they
[1:18:28] were supposed to be spoken
[1:18:29] i've been challenged by that before but
[1:18:31] uh but
[1:18:33] that's i when god does it one way one
[1:18:36] time that's what he does all the way
[1:18:37] through
[1:18:38] right birth by a woman is god's
[1:18:41] permissive will not god's perfect will
[1:18:42] right right
[1:18:44] adam was a spoken word being he came
[1:18:46] forth
[1:18:47] because god spoke him and he breathed
[1:18:50] into him
[1:18:50] the breath of life he took out of that
[1:18:53] perfect being and created the woman
[1:18:55] amen from the man and those two were
[1:18:57] standing there in perfect harmony
[1:19:00] in their ought to be conditioned you
[1:19:02] know i've said that many times
[1:19:04] and there ought to be condition the
[1:19:06] condition that god had created them and
[1:19:08] that we're supposed to be
[1:19:10] in god's mind so i put them at that
[1:19:13] level
[1:19:14] adam and eve were here because that's
[1:19:16] where god had created them that's where
[1:19:18] god had put them
[1:19:19] they're at this position when the fall
[1:19:22] came
[1:19:22] when the fall took place they fell
[1:19:26] they left where they were supposed to be
[1:19:29] and they
[1:19:29] fell to a lesser condition because of
[1:19:32] sin amen
[1:19:34] sin had put them in a fallen condition
[1:19:36] or a
[1:19:37] lesser condition than what they were
[1:19:39] supposed to be
[1:19:40] or in the place that god had created
[1:19:42] them in at the beginning
[1:19:44] they were supposed to be here you
[1:19:48] we god's children today are supposed to
[1:19:50] be
[1:19:51] here not down here yes you say well the
[1:19:54] world's getting worse
[1:19:55] yes it is but that doesn't mean we get
[1:19:58] worse with them
[1:19:59] amen and you say well we're better than
[1:20:02] they are
[1:20:02] but if they keep falling and you keep
[1:20:04] falling with them you say well we're
[1:20:06] better than they are but you're not
[1:20:07] where you're supposed to be
[1:20:08] am i yeah we're still supposed to be
[1:20:10] here no matter how far they go
[1:20:12] right the bride god's children are
[1:20:15] supposed to be in their ought to be
[1:20:16] conditioned
[1:20:17] here now we know we're still in bodies
[1:20:19] we're born in sin
[1:20:20] shaped and equally come the world
[1:20:22] speaking lives we understand that this
[1:20:23] body our spirit
[1:20:24] is subject to the elements of the world
[1:20:26] subject to satan's seed we know that but
[1:20:28] that's not what god's looking at
[1:20:30] am i that's not what god's looking for
[1:20:32] and that shouldn't be our main focus
[1:20:34] our main focus should not be how
[1:20:36] beautiful our hair is or how the new
[1:20:38] suit or
[1:20:39] how good we look together or how we are
[1:20:41] in church or wherever we go
[1:20:43] our main concern should be where is my
[1:20:45] soul
[1:20:47] what is the condition of my soul where
[1:20:50] is
[1:20:50] my soul at what level is my soul
[1:20:54] is my soul still in a falling condition
[1:20:57] or is it where it's supposed to be
[1:20:59] is it in its ought to be conditioned
[1:21:02] when adam and eve fell
[1:21:05] god had already began the process
[1:21:09] of bringing adam and eve back to where
[1:21:11] they were
[1:21:12] again that's called redemption right
[1:21:15] that's called bringing them from their
[1:21:17] fallen condition back to where they're
[1:21:19] supposed to be
[1:21:20] that redemptive plan began right here
[1:21:23] genesis 3 21 god made them coats of
[1:21:27] skins and
[1:21:28] clothed them so they could walk out into
[1:21:30] god's presence
[1:21:31] that began the process of redemption it
[1:21:34] did not put them back in their ought to
[1:21:36] be conditioned again
[1:21:38] but it put them in a place that was
[1:21:41] better than where they were
[1:21:42] but full redemption that's just the
[1:21:44] beginning of a redemptive process
[1:21:46] full redemption puts you back where
[1:21:48] you're supposed to be
[1:21:50] that's what full redemption is right and
[1:21:52] we know that in the continuation
[1:21:54] the birth of jesus that's where it
[1:21:57] brought humanity again
[1:22:00] the blood of jesus was able to bridge
[1:22:02] the gap
[1:22:03] it was able to bridge and bring a bloody
[1:22:05] bridge over that chasm
[1:22:07] so that man and god could come back into
[1:22:10] fellowship
[1:22:10] and unite once again heaven and earth
[1:22:14] brother adam said embrace one another
[1:22:17] heaven and earth kissed when jesus come
[1:22:20] forth
[1:22:21] because it was once again that time that
[1:22:23] god and man could come back together
[1:22:25] again
[1:22:26] to be able to put humanity
[1:22:30] and god's people back into an ought to
[1:22:33] be conditioned
[1:22:34] not physically spiritually because
[1:22:37] notice we're
[1:22:38] still in this falling condition the
[1:22:40] redemptive process
[1:22:41] had just begun we're in that redemptive
[1:22:44] process
[1:22:45] god has already redeemed our souls our
[1:22:47] souls are where they're supposed to be
[1:22:48] if you're born again and filled with the
[1:22:50] holy ghost your soul is where it ought
[1:22:52] to be
[1:22:53] but our physical condition is reaching
[1:22:56] to that place
[1:22:57] yes and it will get to that place
[1:22:59] whether it's by the grave
[1:23:00] or whether it's by a rapture this body
[1:23:03] change will happen you'll be in your
[1:23:04] ought to be
[1:23:05] conditioned in a glorified condition and
[1:23:08] then we'll leave this world
[1:23:09] amen amen one way or the other then
[1:23:11] we'll leave this world
[1:23:12] but that redemptive process had begun
[1:23:16] now i had to take according to the bible
[1:23:20] someone who was related to you
[1:23:24] to be able to bring you back
[1:23:27] let's go over to leviticus let's read
[1:23:30] this process of redemption
[1:23:34] now leviticus 25 speaks about it in
[1:23:37] length
[1:23:38] and in several parts it talks about land
[1:23:41] it talks about
[1:23:43] houses it talks about people it talks
[1:23:45] about servants indentured servants
[1:23:48] uh slaves if you will but i just want to
[1:23:51] focus on the land part of it now
[1:23:54] just for a few moments
[1:23:57] to to get to the redemptive part of it
[1:24:02] leviticus 25.
[1:24:05] now this is god's law okay this is man's
[1:24:07] law right this is god's law
[1:24:09] this is god's requirement
[1:24:12] it's not something that people look to
[1:24:14] today it's not something people follow
[1:24:17] today
[1:24:18] not in this country not anywhere that i
[1:24:19] know of
[1:24:21] maybe in israel i don't know if they
[1:24:22] still do that or not but they don't hear
[1:24:25] uh here if you buy a piece of property
[1:24:28] it's yours
[1:24:29] you own it free and clear done as long
[1:24:31] as you've got the money to pay for it
[1:24:33] you pay for it it's yours it belongs to
[1:24:36] you
[1:24:37] nobody can come take it from you nobody
[1:24:41] can force you to sell it to them
[1:24:45] legally maybe with a gun but they can't
[1:24:48] force
[1:24:49] you to sell it to them but
[1:24:53] it's a different situation because
[1:24:56] god sent the children of israel to a
[1:24:58] place that he had promised them
[1:25:01] the land that was flowing with milk and
[1:25:02] honey and god lets them know
[1:25:05] just like he lets us know all the time
[1:25:08] that all of this
[1:25:10] is his right yes everything is his
[1:25:14] i mean i told that we talked about that
[1:25:16] the other day
[1:25:17] a lot of times people are concerned with
[1:25:20] their wallets
[1:25:21] uh and but god owns it all right
[1:25:24] amen he just makes us stewards of 90
[1:25:28] of it right right he owns it all but
[1:25:30] it's all his
[1:25:31] if he wants it here it is whatever it is
[1:25:34] it belongs to god well he lets them know
[1:25:37] that this is his
[1:25:39] see 21st verse so leviticus 25
[1:25:42] 21 he says then i will command my
[1:25:47] blessing
[1:25:48] upon you in the sixth year and it shall
[1:25:51] bring forth fruit
[1:25:52] for three years this is the law of the
[1:25:54] land he's telling them
[1:25:56] where he's telling them uh that every
[1:25:59] every seventh year they are to rest the
[1:26:01] land you're to
[1:26:03] harvest and grow and plant and for six
[1:26:06] years
[1:26:07] but in the seventh year the land was to
[1:26:10] have a sabbath
[1:26:11] the land was to have a rest and they
[1:26:13] weren't to plow
[1:26:14] or to plant anything in the seventh year
[1:26:17] so there so he's telling them so in the
[1:26:20] sixth year what i'm going
[1:26:22] to do now is similar to when they
[1:26:25] left egypt and they went into the
[1:26:26] wilderness
[1:26:28] and he sent manna to them now now god
[1:26:32] told him and through moses now you
[1:26:33] gather this manna every day
[1:26:36] except for the sabbath you rest the
[1:26:38] sabbath and don't gather on the sabbath
[1:26:41] but what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[1:26:44] send you enough manna
[1:26:45] on the sixth day that you can gather a
[1:26:48] double portion
[1:26:50] so that you won't have to gather on the
[1:26:52] seventh you'll have enough for both days
[1:26:55] right now that's a life of faith
[1:26:58] now there's people in the bible that did
[1:27:00] not have faith
[1:27:01] right so what they would do is they
[1:27:03] would try to go out on the seventh day
[1:27:05] because they didn't have to go what if
[1:27:07] it runs out oh well what if this happens
[1:27:09] what if that happens
[1:27:10] and you know that's the fear-mongering
[1:27:12] that goes on in the world today
[1:27:13] right you hear it on the news all the
[1:27:15] time
[1:27:16] you very seldom hear things on the news
[1:27:18] that says this this and this
[1:27:20] it says what if maybe could be possibly
[1:27:23] and they scare people to death over
[1:27:25] possibilities and might be
[1:27:26] good bees oh this could be the worst
[1:27:30] christmas ever
[1:27:31] well thanks for telling me i i had a
[1:27:35] little different plan
[1:27:37] but they scare people now but you know
[1:27:39] we live by faith
[1:27:41] but they scare people to death out here
[1:27:43] with that stuff right
[1:27:45] because they don't live by faith right
[1:27:47] so those are the people that would go
[1:27:49] gather on the seventh day
[1:27:50] well then they would get stoned of
[1:27:52] course but
[1:27:53] and so there were people that would try
[1:27:55] to try god's
[1:27:56] law and they would try to go gather and
[1:27:59] say well but what if we run out
[1:28:01] what if there's not enough well what if
[1:28:02] it spoils because you know
[1:28:04] if we if that night we gather that day
[1:28:08] anything that's left over spoils the
[1:28:10] next day
[1:28:11] so if we gather on the sixth it's gonna
[1:28:14] be spoiled on the sabbath we gotta get
[1:28:15] small in the seventh no god took care of
[1:28:17] that too
[1:28:18] yes amen the manna that god gave them on
[1:28:21] the sixth day did not spoil on the
[1:28:23] seventh
[1:28:24] he took care of them but they had to
[1:28:27] live by faith and believe
[1:28:28] right this is going to work the way god
[1:28:30] said it's going to work
[1:28:32] and friend that's the test of faith we
[1:28:33] get every day amen is it going to work
[1:28:36] the way god said it was going to work
[1:28:38] we have to believe that we don't have
[1:28:40] any signposts or scientific proof
[1:28:43] or medical proof we don't have any
[1:28:45] insurance or doctors and
[1:28:47] the president's not going to get up and
[1:28:48] say it so we have to believe in faith
[1:28:51] that what god
[1:28:52] said he would do he's going to do amen
[1:28:54] period
[1:28:56] when we have faith that way that we live
[1:28:58] that way
[1:28:59] job was the most perfect man according
[1:29:01] to the bible
[1:29:02] but yet job lived in fear so much
[1:29:06] he even said the thing he feared the
[1:29:08] most is what came on him
[1:29:10] right the thing he feared the most you
[1:29:13] know people can fear so much they'll
[1:29:14] actually develop the symptoms of
[1:29:16] something and not even have it
[1:29:17] right right because of the fear that
[1:29:20] comes on them
[1:29:21] it's a spirit yeah fear is a spirit and
[1:29:24] it's a spirit that is ruling this
[1:29:26] country
[1:29:27] it's a spirit that is ruling this world
[1:29:29] and i'm going to tell you friend don't
[1:29:31] let it rule you
[1:29:32] amen amen
[1:29:37] so what they were doing is god was
[1:29:40] telling them
[1:29:40] let the ramp the land rest on the
[1:29:42] seventh day
[1:29:44] and what i'll do is what you
[1:29:48] harvest on the sixth day will be enough
[1:29:50] for three days
[1:29:52] or three years excuse me what you
[1:29:54] harvest on the sixth year will be enough
[1:29:56] for three
[1:29:57] you'll let the you'll let it rest in the
[1:29:58] seventh
[1:30:00] and in the eighth you'll start planting
[1:30:02] and by the time that crop comes up
[1:30:04] what i gave you for the three years
[1:30:06] you'll be running out of that just in
[1:30:08] time for the other
[1:30:09] harvest to come and be able to to be
[1:30:11] mature
[1:30:12] so you can start eating that again so
[1:30:14] when god's telling them
[1:30:16] i command my blessings the six years
[1:30:18] shall bring forth those three years
[1:30:20] he's telling them i'll give you enough
[1:30:22] harvest in the sixth
[1:30:24] to sustain you through the next two into
[1:30:26] that
[1:30:27] ninth year and ye shall sow the eighth
[1:30:30] year
[1:30:31] and eat of the old fruit until the ninth
[1:30:33] year
[1:30:34] until your fruits come and it shall ye
[1:30:37] shall eat of the old store
[1:30:40] listen now he says the land shall not be
[1:30:42] sold forever
[1:30:44] for the land is mine
[1:30:52] and i'm allowing you to live in it
[1:30:56] i'm giving it to you so you can enjoy it
[1:30:59] so you can be blessed in it
[1:31:01] it's a lamb formed with milk and honey
[1:31:03] but he's letting him know
[1:31:04] this is not going to be sold because
[1:31:07] it's mine
[1:31:08] amen amen for uh for ye are strangers
[1:31:12] and sojourners with me
[1:31:15] and in all the land of your possession
[1:31:17] ye shall grant a redemption
[1:31:19] for the land a redemption for the lamb
[1:31:23] amen now how does this redemption work
[1:31:27] let's keep reading if thy brother be
[1:31:29] waxing poor
[1:31:31] ah you mean you can have financial
[1:31:32] trouble anyway
[1:31:35] if thy brother be wax and poor and has
[1:31:37] sold away
[1:31:38] some of his possession and if any of his
[1:31:41] kin
[1:31:42] come to redeem it then shall he redeem
[1:31:44] that which his brother sold
[1:31:48] and if the man have none to redeem it
[1:31:50] and himself
[1:31:51] be able to redeem it then let him count
[1:31:54] the ears of the cell thereof
[1:31:56] and restore the overplus unto the man to
[1:31:59] whom he sold it that he may return
[1:32:01] unto his possession but if he be not
[1:32:04] able to restore it to him
[1:32:06] then that which is sold shall remain in
[1:32:08] the hand of him that bought it
[1:32:10] unto the year of jubilee and in ghibli
[1:32:12] it shall go
[1:32:13] out and shall return unto his possession
[1:32:17] now this can sound complicated but it
[1:32:20] really isn't
[1:32:22] first of all we've established the land
[1:32:24] belongs to god
[1:32:25] right but let's just say gods give a
[1:32:28] portion of that land to me
[1:32:31] and i fall in a poor condition
[1:32:34] i have some financial difficulties
[1:32:37] could you imagine it's great that nobody
[1:32:41] ever
[1:32:42] the people has never had some but
[1:32:43] there's people that actually have had
[1:32:45] financial difficulties
[1:32:47] amen and if i had some financial
[1:32:50] difficulties
[1:32:51] i could take a part of this land and i
[1:32:54] can sell it to somebody
[1:32:55] else now it could be somebody in the
[1:32:57] church it could be brother dennis it
[1:32:59] could be brother danny
[1:33:01] it could be any of you or it could be
[1:33:03] somebody that's walking down the street
[1:33:05] this guy lives in this apartment across
[1:33:07] the street got ten thousand dollars to
[1:33:09] say okay i'll sell you this piece of
[1:33:10] land for ten thousand dollars
[1:33:11] then i sell it then i take that money
[1:33:14] and he takes that land and he utilizes
[1:33:16] it for whatever he wants to utilize it
[1:33:18] for
[1:33:19] he gets his at that time it's his land
[1:33:22] right right so he can use it for
[1:33:26] whatever he wants to use it for
[1:33:27] a lot of times they would take it and
[1:33:29] grace cow or sheep or
[1:33:31] they would use it to plant and to sow
[1:33:33] and to and to
[1:33:34] bring a harvest forth or something
[1:33:36] whatever you needed the land for
[1:33:38] you could use it for that land would be
[1:33:41] yours to utilize
[1:33:42] whatever way you wanted to because you
[1:33:44] gave me money for it
[1:33:46] so now it's yours this track here
[1:33:48] belongs to you to use however you want
[1:33:50] to
[1:33:50] but now if if uh uh
[1:33:55] my son i was gonna use micah but he went
[1:33:57] to the restroom
[1:33:59] if my son come up and he says okay now i
[1:34:02] want
[1:34:03] my daddy's piece of land back the person
[1:34:06] that bought it
[1:34:07] has to sell it to it because he's my kin
[1:34:11] he's related to me he's my son my wife
[1:34:14] could come
[1:34:15] i want my daddy's property back here's
[1:34:17] the money
[1:34:18] and and he the man that takes the
[1:34:21] increase of what he used for the land
[1:34:23] it's his but he could buy that land back
[1:34:26] and now it would be his because it was
[1:34:29] redeemed back because he was my ten
[1:34:33] now you couldn't come up to it and say
[1:34:36] now
[1:34:36] i want to i want to uh buy brother
[1:34:39] newton's land back no
[1:34:40] no i don't have to sell it to you
[1:34:43] understand i don't have to sell my land
[1:34:45] to you because i bought it from him and
[1:34:47] you're not a kinfolk to him
[1:34:49] right you have to be a kinfolk so
[1:34:52] you could come up and say some of you is
[1:34:54] not kind to me could come up and say
[1:34:55] i want to buy it says no i don't have to
[1:34:57] sell it to you
[1:34:58] i'm going to keep it i'm going to hold
[1:35:00] on to it but now if i got in the
[1:35:02] position
[1:35:03] then i could buy it back i could go to
[1:35:05] him and say i want my land back
[1:35:07] and he would have to sell it to me he
[1:35:09] has no choice
[1:35:11] no matter whether he was somebody who
[1:35:12] was related
[1:35:14] or a friend or if it was a stranger out
[1:35:17] in the world doesn't matter
[1:35:18] if i had the money and i could redeem
[1:35:20] that land back and i could pay him for
[1:35:22] it
[1:35:22] he would have to sell it back to me
[1:35:24] right he would have to
[1:35:26] that's his now the land can get sold
[1:35:29] based on the usage of it
[1:35:31] because every 50 years there was a
[1:35:34] jubilee
[1:35:35] and let's just say it was in the fifth
[1:35:37] year after the jubilee
[1:35:39] this man's got potentially 45 more years
[1:35:43] to use that land before he has to give
[1:35:45] it back
[1:35:46] he's got 45 years to use it so the
[1:35:49] land's going to be more valuable to him
[1:35:51] so i can ask more money for it because
[1:35:55] he gets to use it for 45 years
[1:35:57] but now if i sold it to him in the 45th
[1:36:00] year of jubilee
[1:36:02] then he would cost very much money
[1:36:04] because he's only got five years to use
[1:36:06] it
[1:36:06] because every 50 years the jubilee
[1:36:08] trumpet would blow and
[1:36:10] everything that was the way it was had
[1:36:12] to go
[1:36:13] back to its original condition right so
[1:36:16] i sold it to him in the 45th year
[1:36:18] he used it for five years in the 50th
[1:36:21] year when the jubilee trumpet blew
[1:36:23] that man had to give me my property back
[1:36:27] he didn't have a choice had to be
[1:36:30] restored
[1:36:31] in him hath bought it until the year of
[1:36:34] jubilee in that
[1:36:35] jubilee it shall go out and shall return
[1:36:39] unto his possession amen it has to come
[1:36:42] back
[1:36:43] yes amen so it has to be brought back to
[1:36:46] me
[1:36:47] now remember all this is god's right it
[1:36:50] all belongs to god
[1:36:52] that redemptive process of bringing that
[1:36:54] land back
[1:36:56] you understand to bring the land back
[1:36:59] it had to be a a a redemption that took
[1:37:03] place
[1:37:04] to redeem it back to where it once was
[1:37:07] it once was mine
[1:37:09] god chose it's his land he chose what to
[1:37:12] do with it
[1:37:12] it's my land it's my 10 acres i can deal
[1:37:15] with it what i want to
[1:37:17] but if i have to sell it for some reason
[1:37:19] or i lose it for some reason
[1:37:22] my kinfolk can buy it back and bring it
[1:37:24] back to me in my possession
[1:37:26] or on the jubilee it would have to come
[1:37:29] back to me
[1:37:30] that's redemption it was here it failed
[1:37:33] but at some point it has to go back
[1:37:36] here you buy a piece of land it's yours
[1:37:39] in perpetuity
[1:37:41] what well sorry uh i used to be a
[1:37:44] realtor
[1:37:45] it just means until forever it's yours
[1:37:48] forever
[1:37:50] uh or until you decide to sell it or
[1:37:51] entirely until you decide to give it
[1:37:53] away it's your land
[1:37:54] right you don't ever have to go back to
[1:37:56] the first you bought it from it doesn't
[1:37:57] ever go back to that personal list they
[1:37:59] come back and off you twice as much as
[1:38:00] i'm i mean
[1:38:02] it doesn't involve a former owner
[1:38:04] anymore
[1:38:05] but in god's law it's totally different
[1:38:09] that person can only possess that
[1:38:11] property
[1:38:12] for a certain length of time before that
[1:38:15] property has to go back to its original
[1:38:17] condition
[1:38:18] amen that's redemption has to go back
[1:38:21] now the kinsman part of this redemption
[1:38:24] is that person
[1:38:25] had to be kin folk to be able to
[1:38:28] purchase it back to its rightful
[1:38:30] position again well if they weren't ken
[1:38:32] folk how could it come back to its
[1:38:34] original condition
[1:38:36] somebody down the street could offer
[1:38:38] three times what he paid for it but he
[1:38:39] can't sell it to him
[1:38:41] well he could sell it but but the person
[1:38:44] that's buying it has to understand
[1:38:45] that it belongs to me right he could buy
[1:38:48] it from him and say okay i want the
[1:38:50] remaining 10 years on it
[1:38:51] and he said okay i'll sell it to you and
[1:38:53] he can sell it but it's got to come back
[1:38:55] to me
[1:38:56] eventually or if my son again comes up
[1:38:59] and says
[1:39:00] well you're the third person to buy it
[1:39:01] but i want it it's my dad's he had to
[1:39:03] let it go to him
[1:39:05] had to there was no choice had to be a
[1:39:08] kinsmen redeemer
[1:39:09] had to be someone that was kin folk to
[1:39:11] redeem that
[1:39:12] back to its original condition to its
[1:39:15] ought to be conditioned
[1:39:16] amen i like the ought to be better into
[1:39:20] its ought to be conditioned where it's
[1:39:21] supposed to be
[1:39:23] now not supposed to be according to
[1:39:25] god's uh
[1:39:26] according to man's laws or man's rules
[1:39:28] or what they have
[1:39:30] recorded down at the recorder's office
[1:39:32] no we're talking about what it is to god
[1:39:34] right what does it mean to god where is
[1:39:37] it in the mind of god because that's all
[1:39:39] that matters
[1:39:40] right and that's all we care about am i
[1:39:42] that's all that matters to us
[1:39:44] is that it belongs to god well when sin
[1:39:47] entered in the camp in the garden of
[1:39:49] eden
[1:39:50] that that belonged to god fell adam and
[1:39:53] eve fell
[1:39:54] all of creation fell the world
[1:39:57] fell everything went into a fallen
[1:40:00] condition
[1:40:01] because of the selling out of adam and
[1:40:03] eve
[1:40:04] adam to satan right when he sold it out
[1:40:07] to satan he lost
[1:40:08] inheritance in all of it now look what
[1:40:11] brother branham said here
[1:40:13] in the breach message
[1:40:16] if i can find the one i'm thinking about
[1:40:20] now
[1:40:27] pardon me a moment
[1:40:36] now in the breach he said now oh my now
[1:40:38] the forfeited title deed
[1:40:40] is now in the hands of the original
[1:40:42] owner almighty god
[1:40:45] now when adam lost his inheritance
[1:40:50] he lost his inheritance to life
[1:40:55] the picture that brother branham is
[1:40:58] drawing here
[1:41:00] is showing adam as the possessor
[1:41:04] amateur god of the earth
[1:41:07] everything that's in it and everything
[1:41:09] that's going to come forth from it
[1:41:11] right was in his possession who owns it
[1:41:15] god amen but he put his son adam
[1:41:18] in control of it and he said what this
[1:41:21] earth is
[1:41:22] what it represents what all comes from
[1:41:25] it
[1:41:26] is under your control which included
[1:41:29] you and i because just as adam was
[1:41:33] god's original way of doing it
[1:41:36] from the dust of the ground god called
[1:41:39] adam
[1:41:40] from the dust of the ground was each one
[1:41:43] of us supposed to be or are
[1:41:44] actually from the earth we are still
[1:41:47] that but because the original was
[1:41:49] everyone from it is
[1:41:50] amen you understand that right if the
[1:41:53] original one of something
[1:41:54] come from the earth whatever comes off
[1:41:56] of that came from the earth right right
[1:41:58] because that was the origin so we're all
[1:42:00] of the earth still
[1:42:01] but when adam had this under his control
[1:42:04] it was his inheritance the picture
[1:42:07] brother branham draws is
[1:42:09] he actually had the book of life in his
[1:42:10] hands the lamb's book of life
[1:42:13] i've explained this in in how i
[1:42:16] see this unfolding this
[1:42:20] creation adam was standing there
[1:42:23] with the lamb's book of life with every
[1:42:24] name of redemption in the mind of god
[1:42:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:42:28] because that's when your name was
[1:42:29] written on the land's book of life right
[1:42:31] according to the bible
[1:42:32] before the foundation of the world it's
[1:42:33] in his hand
[1:42:35] and as each decree time and season were
[1:42:37] to come forth
[1:42:38] that name was to come out it was to be
[1:42:40] spoken
[1:42:42] and come forth from the earth just like
[1:42:45] it was the first time
[1:42:47] why would god have changed his plan
[1:42:49] right let me ask you that
[1:42:51] again i've been challenged to people so
[1:42:53] my brother didn't say that but let me
[1:42:55] ask you
[1:42:55] how else would it have happened why
[1:42:58] would god have changed his plan
[1:43:00] from the first time when he did it of
[1:43:03] speaking out
[1:43:04] from the dust why would god have done it
[1:43:06] any different after that
[1:43:07] right i don't believe he would because
[1:43:09] he's god
[1:43:10] his first way is perfect yes procreation
[1:43:13] now and the bringing forth of life is a
[1:43:15] permissive will
[1:43:16] right not god's perfect right
[1:43:20] adam would this
[1:43:23] forfeited with this title deed in his
[1:43:25] hand the the last book of life
[1:43:28] was in his hand when he lost it and fell
[1:43:31] to satan in the garden of eden
[1:43:33] he lost it he lost that inheritance
[1:43:37] he lost his inheritance to the earth and
[1:43:39] everything that was coming from the
[1:43:40] earth
[1:43:41] which was the redemption of the man the
[1:43:43] the names that was in that book
[1:43:44] right because when his when he lost his
[1:43:47] earth he lost that too
[1:43:49] right the physical earth itself
[1:43:53] fell into the hands of the one he lost
[1:43:54] it to satan right that's why we still
[1:43:56] live in satan's eden
[1:43:58] this satan's eating still belongs to
[1:44:00] till still belongs to satan
[1:44:02] it's not rightfully his right but he's a
[1:44:04] squatter now to take control
[1:44:06] over in his way until until the time of
[1:44:09] that fullness of redemption
[1:44:11] finishes and then he has to let go of it
[1:44:14] right
[1:44:16] you notice the bible tells us god's plan
[1:44:18] of redemption
[1:44:19] when that fullness of that time and the
[1:44:22] fullness of that redemption takes place
[1:44:24] he has to let go of it physically
[1:44:28] take his filthy hands off of it yes but
[1:44:31] when this forfeited title deed
[1:44:33] with all the names of god's redeemed in
[1:44:36] it the land's book of life
[1:44:38] that went back into the hands of the
[1:44:40] original owner almighty god
[1:44:43] all the names that book went back in the
[1:44:46] hands of god amen that forfeited title
[1:44:48] deed
[1:44:49] now in the hands of the original owner
[1:44:51] almighty god
[1:44:53] the title deed to the earth and to
[1:44:56] eternal life
[1:44:57] when adam forfeited it then satan's
[1:45:01] dirty hands could not take it
[1:45:03] so it went back to its original owner
[1:45:06] god himself the book of life the last
[1:45:09] book of life
[1:45:11] satan's dirty hands could not take
[1:45:13] control
[1:45:14] over those lives you understand
[1:45:17] he could not take control over those
[1:45:19] lives
[1:45:21] he took control over the earth but he
[1:45:23] could not take control over god's
[1:45:25] redeemed
[1:45:25] over god's people over god's chosen
[1:45:29] he could not take control over those
[1:45:31] because of his filthy hands could not do
[1:45:33] it
[1:45:33] because those were god's people
[1:45:37] now
[1:45:40] in the story of ruth
[1:45:45] brings and draws out the redemptive plan
[1:45:48] beautifully
[1:45:50] because boaz was naomi's
[1:45:53] near kinsmen wow a few weeks ago we went
[1:45:56] through and talked about
[1:45:57] the book of ruth and in the subject of
[1:45:59] resting
[1:46:01] and being at rest and ruth resting
[1:46:04] and that then those stages of her
[1:46:06] resting and working and
[1:46:08] uh uh and rewarded and those steps
[1:46:12] the resting we rest in christ
[1:46:16] and that and we talked about ruth and
[1:46:18] what she went through and what she did
[1:46:20] and how boaz was that kinsmen redeemer
[1:46:23] because he was kinfolk to uh to naomi
[1:46:27] you know naomi's husband had passed away
[1:46:30] naomi's sons had passed away which one
[1:46:32] of them of course was ruth's
[1:46:33] husband had all passed away but ruth was
[1:46:36] a virtuous woman
[1:46:38] and they recognize ruth as a virtuous
[1:46:41] woman
[1:46:42] uh boaz speaks of it it talks about how
[1:46:44] she was a virtuous woman
[1:46:46] and the process that it went through
[1:46:49] excuse me i'm skipping
[1:46:51] things to try to put an end on this uh
[1:46:54] time's getting away from me but uh there
[1:46:57] had to be that
[1:46:59] way of bringing back what
[1:47:02] uh what naomi had lost when they had
[1:47:05] moved away
[1:47:07] but even though they had moved away it's
[1:47:09] still that that inheritance still
[1:47:11] belonged to them
[1:47:12] and boaz was working it and
[1:47:15] and boaz liked ruth
[1:47:19] and wanted to have ruth to himself
[1:47:23] and he said i'll redeem all that naomi
[1:47:26] has
[1:47:26] which would be ruth and all that she has
[1:47:30] but boaz says there's a a nearer kinsman
[1:47:33] than i
[1:47:33] am there's somebody that's closer
[1:47:36] there's somebody that's next in line
[1:47:38] before me
[1:47:40] they have rights to it first i can't
[1:47:43] just go and claim it
[1:47:44] when there's somebody else that has a
[1:47:46] better claim on it than i do
[1:47:48] right so he said at the city gate
[1:47:51] and he gathered together the man who was
[1:47:54] the nearer kinsman
[1:47:56] and ten witnesses of the city
[1:47:59] and he told this man the situation with
[1:48:02] naomi
[1:48:03] and the land that was the limitless and
[1:48:05] said uh you can redeem it because you're
[1:48:07] the nearer kinsman but if you don't
[1:48:10] redeem it i'm going to redeem it
[1:48:12] and the man says i'll redeem it and he
[1:48:15] says okay
[1:48:16] you can redeem it but you've got to know
[1:48:19] that if you redeem hers
[1:48:21] and you redeem naomi you're going to
[1:48:23] have to redeem ruth too
[1:48:26] and the man says i can't do that because
[1:48:29] that would mar
[1:48:30] my inheritance you understand
[1:48:34] he said that would mar my inheritance i
[1:48:37] can't redeem them to me
[1:48:39] because i can't take ruth to myself
[1:48:41] because that would mar
[1:48:42] my inheritance now who was that
[1:48:46] that had the greater
[1:48:49] chance at you before the birth of jesus
[1:48:55] sin fell in the camp right we were born
[1:48:59] in sin
[1:48:59] shaped iniquity come the world speaking
[1:49:01] lives
[1:49:02] every bit everything we did was
[1:49:04] controlled by the devil
[1:49:06] we were born with a fallen nature the
[1:49:08] way
[1:49:09] the ways we live the places we went the
[1:49:11] words we spoke the things we did
[1:49:14] emulated everything that was satanic and
[1:49:17] ungodly we belong to him
[1:49:20] he was that nearer kinsman satan was
[1:49:23] right
[1:49:24] but when it come time for a redemption
[1:49:27] because he was only a squatter just like
[1:49:29] the earth
[1:49:30] just like the earth he was only a
[1:49:32] squatter
[1:49:33] he only had control over for a short
[1:49:36] period of time
[1:49:38] but when he come to be able to fully
[1:49:40] redeem it he couldn't do it
[1:49:42] because he's a devil and he can't redeem
[1:49:45] god's children as a kinsmen redeemer
[1:49:48] because he'd have to get rid of the
[1:49:50] devil to do it
[1:49:51] right right and jesus told us if satan
[1:49:54] casts out satan his kingdom is divided
[1:49:57] he can't do that if he destroyed the
[1:50:00] devil
[1:50:01] to redeem us where we're supposed to be
[1:50:04] because we're in the mind of god right
[1:50:06] that's where we're supposed to be
[1:50:07] he can't redeem you there's no way he
[1:50:10] could
[1:50:11] kinsmen take control over you because if
[1:50:14] he did that he would have to kill
[1:50:16] himself
[1:50:18] he would have to destroy the devil the
[1:50:19] devil not this devil can't destroy the
[1:50:21] devil
[1:50:23] so he has to relinquish his rights over
[1:50:26] and the birth of jesus came amen as a
[1:50:29] kinsman
[1:50:30] amen as a human he had to be a human god
[1:50:33] couldn't send an angel
[1:50:35] melchizedek the form of a theophany
[1:50:38] wasn't good enough
[1:50:39] had to be a human being had to be
[1:50:41] someone that was born into this world
[1:50:43] as the flesh of a human sinless flesh
[1:50:46] but the flesh of a human to be able to
[1:50:49] be kinfolk to you and i
[1:50:50] am to produce and to perform
[1:50:54] the act of redemption of bringing us
[1:50:57] back to himself right jesus
[1:51:00] was the only one that could do it now it
[1:51:02] wasn't the
[1:51:03] the the blood of a literal lamb or a
[1:51:05] bull or a goat
[1:51:07] but it was the lamb it was the blood of
[1:51:08] almighty god
[1:51:10] now the chemistry of the blood fell into
[1:51:12] the earth to redeem the earth back to
[1:51:13] god
[1:51:14] but the but when the blood cell was
[1:51:17] broke it released the life of god
[1:51:19] amen and the life of god come back into
[1:51:21] the worshipper
[1:51:22] amen and redeem the worshipper back now
[1:51:24] his life lives in us
[1:51:26] amen because he's redeemed us he could
[1:51:28] do it
[1:51:29] because he was in the rightful position
[1:51:32] to do it
[1:51:33] when when boaz uh said i'll redeem it
[1:51:37] and i'll take it because i can take ruth
[1:51:39] under myself she'll belong to me
[1:51:41] it won't mar i'm my inheritance we're
[1:51:44] kin folk and it won't mar
[1:51:45] mine he took his shoe off and and gave
[1:51:48] it to him
[1:51:49] as a sign of possession
[1:51:52] that's footsteps possession all through
[1:51:54] the bible you read footsteps possession
[1:51:57] it was a sign
[1:51:58] they did in israel took a show off and
[1:51:59] gave it to him
[1:52:01] because it was a representation for the
[1:52:03] whole city to see
[1:52:04] let this be known today that i have
[1:52:07] redeemed naomi
[1:52:09] i have redeemed ruth i have redeemed all
[1:52:12] that was theirs
[1:52:13] amen that belongs to me
[1:52:29] to me available yeah now when jesus uh
[1:52:33] revelation 5 you look when jesus came
[1:52:35] forth he took the book
[1:52:37] because he was the only one worthy to
[1:52:39] take what book that
[1:52:40] title deed of redemption amen the book
[1:52:44] because he was the only one
[1:52:45] worthy to take it satan's worth that
[1:52:48] satan's filthy hands couldn't take it
[1:52:51] because it there was no way he could
[1:52:53] redeem it without him not being a devil
[1:52:55] and that's who he was he could not
[1:52:58] redeem it or it would mar
[1:52:59] his inheritance what's his inheritance
[1:53:03] all those out in the world
[1:53:05] all this out here in the science
[1:53:06] education civilization that's all his
[1:53:08] inheritance
[1:53:09] satan's eating it's all his inheritance
[1:53:12] amen
[1:53:12] that's not god's inheritance right or
[1:53:14] god's inheritance
[1:53:16] jesus had to come forth continuing that
[1:53:19] plan of redemption god started in the
[1:53:21] garden of eden
[1:53:23] that was reflected in abel's sacrifice
[1:53:25] to be able to redeem
[1:53:27] his children back to himself the only
[1:53:30] way he could do it is that he was born
[1:53:33] right he had to be born
[1:53:36] jesus god had to form in the womb of
[1:53:39] mary
[1:53:39] a blood cell that would bring forth
[1:53:41] jesus christ
[1:53:42] that would live and die to redeem us
[1:53:45] back to himself
[1:53:47] go to hell and redeem those that were
[1:53:49] there emptied out paradise and had to
[1:53:51] uh adam and eve and and abraham and all
[1:53:55] had to release them and send them forth
[1:53:57] because his blood didn't just cover
[1:53:59] us for today all his blood went all the
[1:54:03] way back to the very beginning of this
[1:54:05] process
[1:54:06] all the way back to the garden of eden
[1:54:08] yes and redeemed
[1:54:10] every one of his that was his back unto
[1:54:12] him again
[1:54:13] amen he elevated and brought everyone
[1:54:16] back to their ought to be conditioned
[1:54:18] amen they're in that position now the
[1:54:21] only thing keeping us here is these
[1:54:23] kind bodies yes we're in this flesh
[1:54:26] we're in this sinful flesh
[1:54:27] our spirit's even subject to the world
[1:54:30] but god has already redeemed us the
[1:54:32] process
[1:54:33] in you personally has already begun when
[1:54:35] you were born again
[1:54:37] when god put his life in you that
[1:54:39] process had already begun
[1:54:41] amen now when these bodies take on the
[1:54:43] completeness of
[1:54:44] romans 8 tells us the completeness of
[1:54:46] that of that redemption in our bodies or
[1:54:49] that is to say
[1:54:50] the redemption of our bodies the
[1:54:53] changing of our bodies
[1:54:55] the bringing forth of our bodies unto
[1:54:57] his like unto his glorious body
[1:55:00] the fullness of that redemption well
[1:55:02] without jesus being born
[1:55:05] whether it's april whether it's may
[1:55:07] whatever day
[1:55:08] it was had to come forth
[1:55:12] and when he had to come forth he had to
[1:55:13] come forth to bring himself forth as
[1:55:16] that kinsman
[1:55:17] to redeem us back as our kinfolk
[1:55:20] because we belong to him he's a part of
[1:55:23] us
[1:55:23] now he's not kinfolk to everybody
[1:55:26] understand he's not kinfolk to everybody
[1:55:29] that's why he told that like we said we
[1:55:31] paraphrased it
[1:55:33] in matthew he said depart from me you
[1:55:34] that work iniquity i never knew you why
[1:55:37] because they're not kid folks
[1:55:38] right they're not his kin humans
[1:55:41] but not his kin we are his kin because
[1:55:44] our names were in that book
[1:55:46] of life that lamb's book of life that
[1:55:48] book of redemption
[1:55:49] that title deed that searches back
[1:55:51] through into the mind of god
[1:55:53] where god had you before the foundation
[1:55:55] of the world in his mind
[1:55:57] jesus had to be born as that kinsmen
[1:56:01] to bring to bring us back to him to
[1:56:04] fulfill the law of redemption
[1:56:06] to complete what jesus or what god had
[1:56:08] started there in the garden of eden
[1:56:11] and to bring it forth and friend we're
[1:56:12] at the we're at the end of this thing
[1:56:14] now where god's going to complete this
[1:56:16] yes he's going to complete this in this
[1:56:19] and then all that we're his are going to
[1:56:20] live together with him through eternity
[1:56:23] praise the lord that's his children but
[1:56:25] yet we still enjoy the blessings of
[1:56:28] being his kinman
[1:56:30] we still enjoy the blessings that god
[1:56:32] give us the testimonies how many
[1:56:34] testimonies we have
[1:56:35] beautiful god healings god delivering
[1:56:37] god blessing
[1:56:38] yes the testimonies that's living in the
[1:56:40] blessings of god
[1:56:42] right yes god
[1:56:46] showing his children how much he loves
[1:56:48] you amen
[1:56:50] he loves us just as much when we go
[1:56:53] through the dark times
[1:56:54] as he does when we go through the
[1:56:56] lifetimes
[1:56:57] he loves us just as much in the valleys
[1:56:59] as he does when we're on the mountain
[1:57:02] amen he's the same everywhere he's our
[1:57:05] god
[1:57:06] he he had to be born to be our kinsmen
[1:57:10] to redeem us back to himself and bring
[1:57:13] us back to that position again
[1:57:14] now spiritually our souls
[1:57:18] redeemed sealed by the holy spirit amen
[1:57:21] and it's out to be conditioned looking
[1:57:24] forward to the time as these bodies
[1:57:25] continue to lose this world
[1:57:27] continues to lose grip over our bodies
[1:57:29] over our spirits
[1:57:31] we become more and more like jesus
[1:57:32] christ we become more and more in his
[1:57:34] image we become closer and closer to him
[1:57:37] to the point that this this earth this
[1:57:39] cosmos this world
[1:57:41] loses grip on those on that on that
[1:57:43] group we call the variety
[1:57:45] internationally

[1:58:39] god did what he did yes through the
[1:58:42] process of god
[1:58:43] having to honor his own word god
[1:58:47] having to fulfill his own word there's
[1:58:50] not a situation that comes up today
[1:58:52] that god doesn't just say and come and
