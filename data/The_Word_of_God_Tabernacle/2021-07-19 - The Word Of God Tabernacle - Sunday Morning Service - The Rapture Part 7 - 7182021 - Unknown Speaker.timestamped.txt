[12:49] mother's fault

[12:58] going to run the buyouts
[13:01] and they still don't know what it is i'm
[13:03] trusting and believing just nothing
[13:06] amen and even when they go in they won't
[13:08] even find it
[13:09] praise the lord amen
[13:13] because i want to say this before the
[13:15] congregation
[13:16] my oncologist thinks it might be cancer
[13:19] and he was telling me
[13:20] lining up key mama didn't know
[13:23] so i'm going to claim the victory

[13:46] uh
[13:52] um just kind of want to give kind of a
[13:54] testimony slash praise report
[13:56] um i do want to thank the lord for
[13:58] getting us all through covid
[14:00] it was pretty pretty bad my dad is still
[14:04] in the hospital
[14:05] and he ended up he was doing really good
[14:08] but he ended up getting
[14:10] a mrsa staff and cocci infection
[14:14] in the hospital so his oxygen had
[14:16] pulmonary so that's what we've been
[14:18] fighting since
[14:18] tuesday they had intubated him and
[14:22] i had just i don't know why i didn't
[14:24] think to put a prayer cloth and sister
[14:27] sonia reminded me of sister
[14:28] lydia's sister's testimony and so
[14:31] i just couldn't wait to get to the
[14:33] hospital and i put it on
[14:35] and his nurse that he had on tuesday
[14:38] i saw her yesterday and she said we
[14:41] can't believe how fast he's
[14:44] i am tired of living
[14:48] under my privileges
[14:52] he said we live below our privileges and
[14:55] i am just praying and confessing and
[14:57] believing
[14:58] that not only is all of this infection
[15:00] gone my dad's cognitive
[15:03] all of his cognitive will be restored
[15:05] and
[15:06] that he will be home by the end of the
[15:09] week
[15:09] he will be restored because god's not
[15:11] just a healer
[15:12] he's a restorer amen he loves the lord
[15:15] he can restore my dad
[15:17] prior to what he was at before coveted
[15:20] and even better and that's what i
[15:22] believe in yes
[15:23] amen amen so thank you all for praying
[15:27] you all mean the world to me
[15:31] and let's just stand as we take these

[39:01] amen that paul is just getting so much
[39:03] greater
[39:04] you know the pool to go home is great
[39:06] but you know the poor
[39:07] just want to be alone with the lord yeah
[39:10] paul to just have a greater and a deeper
[39:12] relationship with him a whole to let
[39:14] everything else around the world and all
[39:16] the characters and the things
[39:18] of life just go by the wayside just let
[39:20] the lord handle those and
[39:22] amen and just feel that whole palm
[39:24] drawings to him
[39:26] and you know brother graham said that he
[39:28] that got to where he lived so close to
[39:30] god
[39:30] that god said enoch you're closer to me
[39:32] you are there come on home
[39:35] again praise the lord that's the full
[39:37] amount that's what we're looking for
[39:39] again that's what we're feeling is that
[39:42] full praise the lord
[39:43] amen i'm so thankful god's blessings in
[39:46] our lives
[39:47] so thankful of what the lord does for us
[39:49] every day and for what he's given to us
[39:51] in this hour with this message the truth
[39:53] of his word
[39:54] amen and the testimonies and miracles
[39:56] the things that's happening
[39:58] you know the one thing that sister julie
[40:00] of course there's a thousand things
[40:02] sister julie didn't put her testimony
[40:04] but the one thing that's very
[40:07] outstanding
[40:08] is the fact that her dad contracted
[40:10] cohort and the man has copd
[40:14] that's a death sentence normally you
[40:17] hear people without
[40:18] with outstanding uh physical ailments
[40:22] like that and get it
[40:23] it just that person just doesn't last
[40:25] long but god's really blessed
[40:27] he's negative for cody she didn't say
[40:28] that but he's negative for coping
[40:32] the verses in the hospital almost
[40:35] everybody i know that's in the hospital
[40:37] more than a week gets
[40:38] immersed so but uh god's been so good
[40:42] and we've testified and we've had prayer
[40:45] and we've had prayer requests and things
[40:47] for
[40:47] a month or more now heard of course her
[40:50] and her sister and
[40:51] niece have been negative for a while but
[40:54] um and their dad probably has too but uh
[40:57] all the things that's happened and
[40:58] developed and uh i believe
[41:01] and it just came on my heart one time
[41:03] and testimony to her that god just
[41:06] wanted to get her dad alone
[41:08] yeah maybe i just wanted to get her dad
[41:10] alone to where he talked to him
[41:12] you know sometimes we're resistant
[41:15] sometimes we're
[41:17] negligent to follow that pull
[41:20] but the lord will put us in a situation
[41:22] where we can know that much holy
[41:24] spirit amen and uh with the prayers
[41:27] that's gone up for
[41:28] dad and her dad's in god's hands amen
[41:31] and that's what matters the most and
[41:33] he's a child of god and he's going to be
[41:35] on the other side and no one
[41:38] can pluck him out of the hands of god
[41:40] commander praise the lord and that's
[41:41] what matters
[41:42] amen the most we get to the other side
[41:45] praise the lord
[41:47] you god bless you they stand to our feet
[41:49] if we could
[41:50] we'll just get right to the word i knew
[41:52] we were going to have probably
[41:54] um some things that were going to take a
[41:56] little time today so
[41:58] um i kind of mine feels like we have all
[42:01] the time
[42:02] now don't have to worry about don't
[42:04] still don't want to wear the people
[42:05] don't want to wear you well we have a
[42:09] service but i kind of felt when i was
[42:11] before we started moving yesterday and
[42:13] my time with the lord that uh just
[42:17] a shorter service that they would
[42:19] probably be more appropriate
[42:21] and of course you didn't expect the rain
[42:25] like i said we have so many more things
[42:26] we want to do
[42:28] we want to put a runner excuse our uh
[42:31] sonya got up early with me and vacuumed
[42:34] the
[42:35] rugs that we had those are from our
[42:37] house that we use
[42:39] so they they're not but they served the
[42:41] purpose that's what make sure that
[42:43] slippery feet didn't hit that slick
[42:45] floor because uh that's not a good
[42:47] combination
[42:48] but we want to do that we're going to
[42:50] paint uh
[42:51] everything and put curtains up here and
[42:54] over there
[42:55] there's just several things we want to
[42:56] try to do because you know we kind of
[42:57] drained the coffers when we
[42:59] moved in the place so we just uh wait
[43:01] and as things roll in then we'll just
[43:03] start working to get things done
[43:05] amen so but let's turn in our bibles now
[43:08] to first thessalonians chapter 4
[43:10] where we've been beginning the past six
[43:14] sundays and of course again today that's
[43:16] first thessalonians chapter four still
[43:18] speaking on the rapture this will be the
[43:21] rapture part seven
[43:23] um and we'll just we'll just get this as
[43:27] we read it so
[43:28] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 3 13
[43:32] but before we read it again
[43:33] let's just fire our heads and approach
[43:35] the author
[43:37] father god we're indeed grateful lord
[43:39] again what you've given us today
[43:42] can never be overstated or emphasized or
[43:44] thank you enough lord because
[43:46] we feel so blessed we're just such a
[43:48] blessed people
[43:49] god if we could just uh we could just
[43:51] open our spiritual eyes like elijah said
[43:54] to hazel that day just to see lord the
[43:56] things that you're doing for us
[43:58] all the time the miracles that take
[44:00] place and the things that
[44:02] satan would try to do to us that you
[44:04] don't allow him that we never even know
[44:06] about
[44:07] god just just realizing what you do for
[44:10] us lord and
[44:11] everything is orchestrated by your hand
[44:13] and the child of god is always
[44:15] orchestrated
[44:16] and led by your spirit lord and nothing
[44:18] is done by chance
[44:19] nothing is done by luck or happenstance
[44:22] or consequence lord
[44:24] it's all in your great plan and we
[44:26] believe it and we thank you for it lord
[44:28] we thank you for being here today thank
[44:30] you for each one that has come
[44:31] may you just speak to us from your word
[44:33] once again today
[44:35] may you have complete preeminence in the
[44:37] remaining part of this service
[44:38] as i yield myself lord the best i can
[44:41] father
[44:42] the lord and brother brandon said the
[44:43] only gift he had was to yield himself
[44:45] that's the only gift any of us have lord
[44:47] he's just yielding ourselves that's all
[44:49] i can do lord to just try to yield
[44:51] myself lord i
[44:52] i lord it mentioned it maybe a little
[44:56] shorter service today but
[44:57] i don't want that to be a hindrance on
[44:59] the moving of your spirit lord whatever
[45:01] you'd have for us today god let it be
[45:04] lord if your spirit flows through here
[45:06] god it could be five hours and feel like
[45:08] 15 minutes
[45:09] we're just trusting you whatever you
[45:11] want that's what we want
[45:12] yes lord we just committed to you we ask
[45:14] your blessings anoint
[45:16] not just the speaker lord but to hear
[45:18] each one of us accomplish that
[45:19] that you send it forth for now as we
[45:21] commit it to you and ask your blessings
[45:23] upon it in the name of the lord jesus
[45:25] christ we pray
[45:26] amen amen amen first thessalonians
[45:36] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[45:38] brother concerning them which are asleep
[45:40] that you saw and not even as others
[45:42] which have no hope
[45:43] for we which but for for for if we
[45:46] believe that jesus died and rose again
[45:49] even so them also would slip uh sleep in
[45:52] jesus will god bring with him
[45:54] for this we say unto you by the word of
[45:56] the lord that we which are alive and
[45:58] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[45:59] not prevent them
[46:01] which are asleep for the lord himself
[46:03] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[46:06] with the voice of the archangel with the
[46:07] trump of god of the dead in christ shall
[46:09] rise first
[46:11] then we which are alive and remain shall
[46:12] be caught up together with
[46:14] uh with them in the clouds to meet the
[46:16] lord in the air
[46:17] so shall we ever be with the lord
[46:19] wherefore comfort one another
[46:21] with these words you can be seated if
[46:24] you like
[46:26] amen so just
[46:29] uh as the lord would leave the the
[46:33] uh this part of the service today i felt
[46:35] that to go this direction
[46:36] and just see what the lord would do with
[46:38] it uh but i i just want to
[46:40] take from this the scripture that
[46:42] brother branham used when he preached
[46:45] the rapture message
[46:46] in december 4th 1965 11 days before i
[46:50] was born
[46:52] brother branham preached the rapture
[46:53] message in yuma arizona now obviously
[46:56] brother branham knew
[46:57] of course being a prophet that many of
[46:59] the things that brother branham brought
[47:01] many of the subjects that he touched on
[47:03] he did just that
[47:05] he touched on them uh some things he
[47:08] went into more depth like the seals
[47:10] like the church ages and things like
[47:12] that uh
[47:13] and but a lot of the things like the
[47:15] rapture message there's so many
[47:17] components to the rapture that brother
[47:19] branham spent just maybe an hour and 20
[47:21] minutes i think the tape is
[47:23] just getting some of the highlights of
[47:24] the rapture and taking the scripture
[47:27] a lot of times when we talk about the
[47:29] rapture we begin a subject on the
[47:31] rapture or
[47:32] it comes on our heart to think about
[47:35] rapture we think about the scripture
[47:36] that i just read
[47:38] and that's one reason that i wanted to
[47:39] take the time to
[47:41] uh preface every rapture service that we
[47:44] have
[47:44] that the lord puts on my heart to read
[47:47] from this scripture
[47:48] but when brother brown preached in him
[47:50] of what
[47:52] the rapture message he went to psalms
[47:54] 27.
[47:55] now a lot of times people don't
[47:57] understand psalms 27
[48:00] as a perplexity i've had questions i've
[48:02] had questions myself
[48:04] before why didn't brother brown start
[48:06] with first thessalonians 4
[48:08] but if you go into psalms 27 and you
[48:11] read it
[48:12] and understand the text that brother
[48:14] branham takes from that point
[48:16] you will understand why he said why he
[48:19] started with psalms 27.
[48:21] i want to take psalms 27 and break it
[48:23] down a little bit because
[48:24] uh the part of the rapture i want to
[48:27] talk about today
[48:28] is the rapturing condition of the world
[48:32] the condition the world is to be in
[48:35] when a rapture or when the culmination
[48:38] of a rapture is to take place
[48:40] uh that's what i want to talk about the
[48:42] the the resulting condition what we're
[48:45] looking for
[48:46] a lot of times we talk about road signs
[48:48] and we talk about
[48:49] the the signs of the times as we call
[48:51] them
[48:52] uh those road signs and those signs of
[48:54] the times is just
[48:55] typically scriptural references that we
[48:58] have that we look to
[48:59] that gives us some guidance to see look
[49:02] this is
[49:03] like this is happening and we find it in
[49:06] the scripture or this
[49:07] condition exists now and we find that in
[49:09] the scripture and
[49:10] there's so many of those scriptural
[49:12] conditions that
[49:14] sometimes you just have to try to take
[49:15] the time and break them down
[49:17] oh brother branham when he goes in
[49:19] through the rapture message
[49:21] halfway maybe a third of the way through
[49:24] brother branham
[49:25] actually does come in quotes or i can't
[49:27] remember if he actually reads
[49:29] verse thessalonians 4 or if he quotes i
[49:31] think he reads it
[49:32] because then he starts to break down the
[49:34] shout out the voice and the trump
[49:35] which lord willing will do as well at
[49:37] some point when we get to that place
[49:39] but i felt in my heart to take this
[49:42] but what i got here is the resulting
[49:45] condition
[49:46] uh a rapturing condition of the world
[49:49] today
[49:49] the culmination we know the rapture is
[49:51] in process
[49:52] we know the body changes in process from
[49:54] glory to glory he's changing us
[49:56] right we're changing all the time and
[49:58] then change isn't just
[50:00] uh apparent to the physical body because
[50:02] the change that we're talking about
[50:04] happens from the inside
[50:05] out amen the last part to change
[50:09] is this bowel body that's the last part
[50:11] the change is already in process
[50:13] because the change started on the inside
[50:15] so as that's changing and it's changing
[50:18] your soul is born again and it changes
[50:20] your spirit which changes your nature
[50:22] and
[50:22] then begins to change the flesh well the
[50:24] flesh part
[50:26] the receiving of a new body is the last
[50:28] part that we
[50:29] get before we actually go in a rapture
[50:32] before we actually take to the sky
[50:34] yeah uh but the resulting condition now
[50:36] that's what i want to talk about so
[50:37] let's go to psalms
[50:39] chapter 27 and we'll read the few verses
[50:43] that brother branham read when he
[50:45] prefaced his rapture message amen
[50:48] psalms 27 amen
[50:53] is everybody comfortable amen
[50:57] is anybody not comfortable are you
[50:58] chilly cold
[51:00] except for sister enormous she tells me
[51:02] she's always cold so
[51:04] i don't mean to dismiss her but she
[51:05] doesn't count everybody
[51:07] anybody comfortable this is a trial in
[51:09] there you know
[51:10] uh i don't mean this comical but when i
[51:13] was sitting over there i'd see
[51:14] see you come in and it's like a deer in
[51:17] headlights you're like okay where do i
[51:18] sit now
[51:26] my place where i'm going to sit so i
[51:28] noticed the eyes as they perused the
[51:30] room
[51:31] and even matisse went there and then she
[51:32] went there and she went there and then
[51:34] she went there
[51:36] but uh she kind of moved around a little
[51:38] bit anyway she doesn't stay in the same
[51:40] spot like a lot of us do i always did
[51:42] that too
[51:43] so but i want to make sure you're
[51:44] comfortable the
[51:46] the air is just kind of a trial and
[51:48] error thing you just want to make sure
[51:49] everybody's okay
[51:50] so okay all right well nobody's saying
[51:53] anything so i guess we're okay
[51:54] i'm fine because the air is one right on
[51:56] me so i'm happy
[51:57] i usually get really hot so this this is
[52:00] good
[52:01] psalms 27 let's begin with the first
[52:03] verse just like everybody did i just
[52:06] i want to get to this point because i i
[52:08] actually believe that
[52:10] uh that was that was the premise that
[52:12] brother brown was taking
[52:14] when he began the rapture message when
[52:17] he began the rapture message
[52:19] i believe the premise that brother brown
[52:20] started out with
[52:22] in psalms 27 was that rapturing
[52:24] condition
[52:26] was the condition of of the rapture that
[52:29] it was to be
[52:30] so let's look at this as we go through
[52:31] it i'm going to break it down a little
[52:33] bit
[52:33] uh probably way more than brother brown
[52:35] did obviously but
[52:36] just give you what the lord put on my
[52:38] heart
[52:39] uh psalm 27 1 now the lord is my light
[52:43] and my salvation whom shall i fear
[52:47] praise the lord so what does that tell
[52:50] us
[52:51] brother brown preached this and we know
[52:54] that he done it at the direction of the
[52:56] lord right i mean we
[52:58] i don't believe brother branham would
[53:00] have begun the rapture message with this
[53:01] scripture reference
[53:03] if it wasn't let of god right put it
[53:05] that way
[53:06] so when we read this let's take to heart
[53:10] what it's telling us in relation to
[53:12] where we are today oh yeah
[53:14] in the world what's going on around us
[53:17] and what the devil tried to close in on
[53:20] us amen
[53:21] notice not recognize we all recognize
[53:24] the satan's just not going to fold his
[53:26] arms and just say well
[53:28] i give up on that group of people
[53:29] they're they're just pride and they're
[53:31] just gonna go on a rapture and they're
[53:32] just too good for me so i'm just hands
[53:34] off i'm gonna quit
[53:35] you know the devil's not gonna do that
[53:37] he's gonna fight you every single inch
[53:39] of the way
[53:40] plus yeah and as he gets to the end
[53:44] you know he fights even harder as it
[53:46] gets towards the end
[53:48] so as we read this take that in
[53:50] reference in your mind
[53:51] of what the lord is speaking to us here
[53:54] the lord is my light and my
[53:56] salvation whom shall i fear
[53:59] shall i fear death shall i fear the
[54:02] devil
[54:03] shall i fear the government shall i fear
[54:05] anything that the devil
[54:07] or any device that the devil would
[54:09] unleash on him and
[54:10] am i going to fear that
[54:13] no whom shall i fear right
[54:16] shall i i don't want to change the word
[54:18] or add to the word but
[54:20] what shall i fear right yeah not just
[54:23] not necessarily a person it could be
[54:26] anything
[54:27] what shall i fear yeah we've gone
[54:30] through a whole year
[54:31] and it's still happening in the world
[54:33] today
[54:34] the fear that's being placed on people
[54:37] in the world
[54:38] now now obviously there's some
[54:41] uh legitimacy to the people that are in
[54:44] the world and the fear that they feel
[54:46] there's legitimacy to that because a lot
[54:48] of those people don't know god
[54:50] yes right most of them don't know god
[54:52] right and even if they think they have a
[54:55] passing knowledge of god
[54:56] they know that's not good enough they
[54:58] might not acknowledge that
[55:00] uh consciously but in their subconscious
[55:03] they realize that's not good enough
[55:05] so they got to find or have something
[55:07] good enough that's going to get them to
[55:09] the point that they know
[55:10] that the lord is my light and the lord
[55:13] is my salvation
[55:14] and i will not fear amen amen
[55:17] fear is not faith fear is the absolute
[55:20] enemy
[55:21] of faith amen and there's no way we're
[55:23] going to go into rapture
[55:25] without faith without rapturing faith
[55:27] wrong
[55:29] the lord is my the lord is the strength
[55:32] of my life
[55:33] of whom shall i be afraid amen
[55:36] now david says it two different ways but
[55:39] it's still the truth
[55:40] right who or what am i going to fear who
[55:43] or what am i going to be afraid of
[55:46] he's saying the lord is my salvation the
[55:48] lord is my strength
[55:50] the lord is my life why am i afraid
[55:54] why why am i worried why do i fear
[55:57] yeah he's saying and the whole premise
[56:00] of that question mark question mark
[56:02] don't right there is nothing to fear
[56:04] very much amen
[56:06] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[56:10] foes come upon me to eat up my flesh
[56:13] they stumbled and fell yes how many
[56:16] times
[56:17] have you acknowledged or recognized that
[56:20] satan has come to try to destroy you
[56:22] and before he could even get a groundhog
[56:25] he falls amen
[56:28] amen and that
[56:31] impenetrable uh barrier that god
[56:34] has with the angels of god with flaming
[56:37] swords encamped around about you
[56:39] cannot be penetrated unless god were to
[56:42] allow it
[56:44] and if god allows it for some reason
[56:46] just like he did joke
[56:47] god's got a purpose for it but as it
[56:49] gets to that point
[56:51] the enemy struggles stumbles and falls
[56:54] because they are no match to god
[56:57] yeah but they are no match to you
[57:00] because you are of god amen amen
[57:04] you are of god little children
[57:07] there's no fear my wicked my enemies
[57:11] come up and they come to destroy me eat
[57:14] up my flesh is destroyed kill
[57:16] but they stumble and fell though and
[57:18] holy encamped against me
[57:21] my heart shall not fear though wars
[57:24] should rise against me
[57:26] in this will i be confident haven't you
[57:28] ever felt like you've been at war how
[57:30] many feels like you're at war now
[57:32] yes amen every day of our lives we're at
[57:36] war
[57:37] every night in our dreams in our sleep
[57:40] yeah amen um i hope sister julie doesn't
[57:44] mind me telling this but
[57:45] she was telling the other day she was
[57:47] talking to her dad and she was she's
[57:49] able to visit him now she's holding his
[57:50] hand and
[57:51] she asked him he said he seemed trouble
[57:55] said are you having bad dreams and she
[57:56] he squeezed her hand really hard and i
[58:00] said well if you'll hold my hand i'll
[58:01] squeeze so hard too because the devil
[58:03] does the same thing to me
[58:05] every day where at war every night we're
[58:07] at war
[58:09] who shall we feel yes amen what divides
[58:12] the enemy can ever overcome the faith
[58:15] and the love that you have
[58:17] and the life that you live and the god
[58:19] then the angels of god
[58:24] amen so many times we fear the unknown
[58:29] but when we're christians there's not an
[58:31] unknown
[58:32] right there shouldn't be because our
[58:34] faith should eliminate
[58:36] the unknown right amen our faith calls
[58:38] the things that are not as though they
[58:41] are how do they do that by faith
[58:45] they call things that aren't you say
[58:48] well it's the unknown
[58:49] no it's not because you control the
[58:52] elements saints
[58:54] you call the things that are not as
[58:56] though they are because you've got
[58:58] faith is that not the scripture amen
[59:00] amen and why
[59:02] why is it or what is there to worry
[59:03] about fret about
[59:05] nothing now look again got to continue
[59:09] to remember
[59:09] this is the resulting condition the the
[59:12] rapture and condition of the world
[59:13] that's going on today
[59:15] the enemy that's coming against you
[59:17] everything that's against and everything
[59:19] that's
[59:20] uh you look in the world even people
[59:22] that call themselves christians friend
[59:24] sometimes some of the people that call
[59:26] you christians are the first
[59:27] ones that want to chop your head off yes
[59:30] get rid of you eat up your flesh destroy
[59:33] your character
[59:34] right i mean um i i
[59:38] said that way but i've experienced it so
[59:40] maybe you have to
[59:41] but it's the truth
[59:44] in this will i be confident one thing
[59:48] have i desired of the lord look at this
[59:50] now
[59:50] this is beautiful and i believe it's
[59:52] synonymous with us
[59:55] one thing have i desired of the lord
[59:57] that i will seek after amen
[1:00:00] so it's like brother john said so y'all
[1:00:02] don't see
[1:00:03] when i listen to these testimonies and i
[1:00:05] hear these songs
[1:00:06] and i see the resulting effect and the
[1:00:08] moving of the spirit
[1:00:10] it it shows me how who's in control of
[1:00:13] this
[1:00:13] because i because i know what the lord's
[1:00:16] already put on my heart
[1:00:17] to bring to you and when i hear
[1:00:18] testimonies like hers and like his and
[1:00:20] the songs and the things
[1:00:22] it it just it it just overwhelms me
[1:00:25] honestly i mean mike is sitting here
[1:00:28] saying i'll try to sing the song
[1:00:30] you just see when it overwhelms you like
[1:00:32] that friend it's just
[1:00:34] sometimes you just want to run out and
[1:00:35] just run around the building walk
[1:00:38] because the spirit of god is just so
[1:00:40] powerful
[1:00:41] but look at this one thing i've desired
[1:00:44] of the lord and that i will seek after
[1:00:47] isn't that just what he was saying and
[1:00:48] that just brother john
[1:00:50] said i i i encourage you
[1:00:53] amen what not his exhortation i
[1:00:55] encourage you to do what
[1:00:57] seek after him amen amen yes
[1:01:00] that thing that i desired my life from
[1:01:03] god
[1:01:03] that's the thing i will seek after amen
[1:01:08] that i may dwell in the house of the
[1:01:10] lord all the days of my life
[1:01:13] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:01:16] inquire in his temples
[1:01:18] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:01:21] me in
[1:01:22] his pavilion and the secret of his
[1:01:24] tabernacle shall he
[1:01:26] hide me he shall set me upon a rock
[1:01:30] now we know the rock is crying he
[1:01:33] sets me upon that rock that rock was
[1:01:35] christ
[1:01:36] now brother ram didn't read the sixth
[1:01:38] verse i'm going to and now shall my head
[1:01:41] be lifted up above my
[1:01:42] enemies round about me therefore my head
[1:01:45] lifted up above the enemy amen
[1:01:48] therefore will i uh offer in this in his
[1:01:51] tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[1:01:54] i will sing yea i will sing praises unto
[1:01:57] the lord
[1:01:59] now in this part where there's a
[1:02:01] transition
[1:02:04] david talks about the enemy and he talks
[1:02:07] about the war
[1:02:08] and then he talks about in conjunction
[1:02:11] with talking about
[1:02:13] why do we fear god is my strength
[1:02:16] god is my life god is my health
[1:02:19] god is my portion god is my everything
[1:02:22] why do i fear why am i worried why am i
[1:02:26] afraid
[1:02:27] why do i be when the enemies come
[1:02:29] against me
[1:02:31] they stumble and they fall and then he
[1:02:34] transitions
[1:02:36] he transitions from that res from that
[1:02:39] rapturing condition that we know the
[1:02:41] world is
[1:02:41] in amen because you know the whole
[1:02:44] world's against you right
[1:02:45] yes you understand this is satan z yes
[1:02:48] and all of satan's eating is against
[1:02:50] god's children
[1:02:52] against god's pride we know that so you
[1:02:54] know the whole world is against you
[1:02:56] correct we all know that
[1:02:58] so even people sometimes it may even
[1:03:01] call your brother
[1:03:02] you know that's taken at home but that
[1:03:04] may be true yes amen
[1:03:06] against you so if you know it's all
[1:03:08] against you
[1:03:09] you know where your portion is you know
[1:03:12] where your strength lies
[1:03:13] and you know where one from where your
[1:03:15] deliverance comes
[1:03:17] amen is the lord so david comes as that
[1:03:20] result that
[1:03:21] rapturing condition of the world today
[1:03:24] which there was a time when this was a
[1:03:26] christian nation
[1:03:28] amen i i it's probably it's still the
[1:03:30] best nation on the
[1:03:31] planet in my opinion but it was once a
[1:03:35] uh
[1:03:35] a a christian nation they turned down
[1:03:38] god and you see the resulting effect
[1:03:40] right but it was once a christian nation
[1:03:42] no more
[1:03:43] obviously the whole world's the whole
[1:03:45] world's against us
[1:03:47] but he transitions from that
[1:03:50] condition to saying but there's one
[1:03:53] thing that i've
[1:03:54] desired one thing my whole life that
[1:03:57] i've desired of the lord
[1:03:59] and that one thing i seek after
[1:04:03] i seek after that one thing and he
[1:04:05] begins to unveil
[1:04:07] what his desire and that rapture is
[1:04:11] that in that that resulting in rapturing
[1:04:14] that takes place
[1:04:15] now i'm i'm not going to read it today
[1:04:18] but i i want to eventually if you want
[1:04:21] to look at it
[1:04:22] uh uh ephesians chapter 2.
[1:04:26] because i i want us to understand
[1:04:29] there's a physical rapture that we're
[1:04:31] looking for
[1:04:32] body change to it the changing of our
[1:04:35] bodies
[1:04:36] to go in a rapture to meet the lord in
[1:04:38] the air we know that physical rapture
[1:04:41] but there is a daily spiritual in
[1:04:43] rapturing that we enjoy
[1:04:45] as christians amen this should be a
[1:04:47] daily enrapturing every day
[1:04:49] that is caught up in with christ in
[1:04:52] heavenly places
[1:04:54] with christ jesus amen and that caught
[1:04:56] up is
[1:04:57] is an enrapturing a spiritual
[1:05:01] experience that we have and enjoy every
[1:05:03] day
[1:05:04] as a christian as a born again holy
[1:05:07] ghost still christian
[1:05:08] there's the physical one that we're
[1:05:09] looking for that we're going to
[1:05:12] but there's that spiritual one that
[1:05:13] happens all the time
[1:05:15] and that's what david's talking about
[1:05:18] see now
[1:05:19] he describes it as different dwelling
[1:05:22] places
[1:05:24] did you notice that as we read through
[1:05:26] it he
[1:05:27] i'm the four or five i forget here we'll
[1:05:29] read it again four or five
[1:05:31] separate different dwelling places that
[1:05:33] david mentions just in these couple of
[1:05:35] verses
[1:05:36] let's read it again this one thing i
[1:05:38] desire the lord i'll seek after that
[1:05:40] amen that i may dwell in the house
[1:05:45] amen that's one that i may dwell in the
[1:05:49] house of the lord
[1:05:50] all the days of my life to behold the
[1:05:53] beauty of the lord and to inquire in his
[1:05:56] temple that's number two
[1:06:00] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:06:04] me in his pavilion
[1:06:07] that's three three separate separate
[1:06:10] dwelling places that he mentions just
[1:06:12] right here
[1:06:13] every one of them different
[1:06:16] in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:06:20] four shall he hide me
[1:06:24] he shall set me upon a rock amen
[1:06:28] look at this for just a moment that i
[1:06:30] may dwell in the house
[1:06:33] well in the house what is a house a
[1:06:36] house is a permanent structure
[1:06:38] a place where you live a place where you
[1:06:42] it's your place of abode it's where you
[1:06:45] live
[1:06:45] it's where you sleep it's where you have
[1:06:47] meals it's where you
[1:06:49] uh uh fellowship with your with your
[1:06:52] family
[1:06:53] and and all it's in your dwelling place
[1:06:55] it's where you
[1:06:56] it's where your bed is it's where your
[1:06:58] couch is it's
[1:07:00] it's your place of abode it's where you
[1:07:02] live it's a
[1:07:03] permanent structure in other words it's
[1:07:06] something that god
[1:07:07] has given that that david says that i
[1:07:10] may dwell in the house
[1:07:12] that it may be a permanent structure
[1:07:15] where everything that i do every part
[1:07:18] and every facet of my life
[1:07:21] that is that is in the house of god
[1:07:24] it is in this permanent dwelling place
[1:07:27] it's where i desire to
[1:07:30] live right period abode
[1:07:33] it's my permanent abode is in the house
[1:07:36] of the lord
[1:07:38] all the days of my life all the all my
[1:07:41] every day
[1:07:42] to behold and uh to behold the beauty of
[1:07:46] the lord
[1:07:47] and to inquire in his temple now what is
[1:07:50] a temple
[1:07:51] a temple is not a place where you
[1:07:52] necessarily have a bed or
[1:07:54] a shower you have a dining table and
[1:07:57] you a boat and you you go to every
[1:08:00] single day or live in
[1:08:01] every single day a temple is a place
[1:08:04] that's
[1:08:05] that's a sacred uh
[1:08:08] uh a set aside a
[1:08:11] place of worship it's uh it's a
[1:08:16] uh it's dedicated for that purpose
[1:08:20] it's sanctified for that purpose it
[1:08:24] is a place of worship it's a place you
[1:08:26] go to
[1:08:27] just just like we have this this isn't
[1:08:29] our place of this is not our house
[1:08:32] we came from our houses we'll go back to
[1:08:34] our houses
[1:08:35] but this is a place that we come to that
[1:08:38] we inquire in the lord
[1:08:39] and enjoy the beauty of the presence of
[1:08:43] the holy spirit
[1:08:44] in this temple in this place that's been
[1:08:48] sacred and and and committed and
[1:08:50] dedicated to god
[1:08:52] that we come here and we worship the
[1:08:54] lord amen
[1:08:56] to do what to behold the beauty of the
[1:08:59] lord and inquire in this temple
[1:09:02] amen praise the lord that's where we
[1:09:05] come to expect
[1:09:07] god to move to expect god to meet us
[1:09:10] here
[1:09:10] amen for in the time of
[1:09:14] trouble he shall hide me now he's
[1:09:16] talking about
[1:09:18] being set into a sacred place and being
[1:09:21] set into a place where
[1:09:23] where he's hid away amen
[1:09:26] get away in the time of trouble he shall
[1:09:29] hide me
[1:09:30] now i hope you keep it in mind the the
[1:09:33] conditioning
[1:09:34] the rapturing condition of the world at
[1:09:36] the time that the rapture is to happen
[1:09:38] and the fact that the rapture itself
[1:09:42] the actual rapture taking place the body
[1:09:45] change
[1:09:46] and the and the going to meet the lord
[1:09:48] in the air this is that rapture message
[1:09:51] with a time of trouble god's going to
[1:09:54] hide me
[1:09:55] and has there ever been a greater
[1:09:56] trouble on the earth today
[1:09:59] i don't know that maybe uh there's ever
[1:10:02] been a greater trouble than what's going
[1:10:04] on in the world today
[1:10:05] and there's been some great troubles
[1:10:07] obviously god destroyed it one time with
[1:10:09] the flood
[1:10:09] right there's obviously been some very
[1:10:11] troubled times on this planet
[1:10:13] but i and i don't know but as far as at
[1:10:16] least the last 2
[1:10:17] 000 years since the death of christ
[1:10:19] there's probably been no
[1:10:20] harder time than there is you say well
[1:10:22] there was the dark ages
[1:10:24] but that was a a physical
[1:10:27] uh persecution of for spiritual reasons
[1:10:31] but the darkness of the world today is
[1:10:34] is
[1:10:35] so blacked out that again brother adam
[1:10:39] on the back wall when god wrote it on
[1:10:41] the black back wall of the tabernacle
[1:10:43] this age was completely blacked out
[1:10:46] right
[1:10:46] even during the dark ages it wasn't
[1:10:48] completely blacked out
[1:10:51] but in this day on the wall when god
[1:10:54] wrote it
[1:10:55] it was black completely black
[1:10:58] so think about that so at this time now
[1:11:01] satan's eating
[1:11:02] as bad as it is that god would take
[1:11:05] his bride now you can go to revelation
[1:11:08] 12 and
[1:11:08] see where god does the same thing to his
[1:11:11] to his children
[1:11:12] to the jews even amen god takes and
[1:11:14] hides them away
[1:11:15] well in this that david is talking about
[1:11:18] he said he will
[1:11:19] hide me in that time of trouble he will
[1:11:22] hide me in his
[1:11:23] pavilion now the pavilion is a
[1:11:27] is a strange thing when i was reading
[1:11:30] this
[1:11:31] and when i hear the word pavilion it
[1:11:33] probably maybe strikes different things
[1:11:35] to you
[1:11:35] i think of of a park and a picnic cabana
[1:11:40] uh structure i've always we've always
[1:11:42] called those a pavilion
[1:11:45] that's in a park a big park where you
[1:11:46] have picnic tables and a structure over
[1:11:49] that's that's like a pavilion
[1:11:51] but if you look in the scripture so so
[1:11:53] it's like a
[1:11:54] a temporary structure that's there to
[1:11:58] to bring shelter a life like the
[1:12:01] like god like the wings of god the wings
[1:12:04] of god that come in and bring
[1:12:06] shelter a pavilion is more a place of
[1:12:09] shelter
[1:12:10] it's not neces it's not your place of
[1:12:12] abode it's not necessarily even a place
[1:12:14] that's of a temple that's
[1:12:16] been dedicated and consecrated and set
[1:12:18] aside for worship and all
[1:12:20] it's a place of shelter it's a place
[1:12:23] like being under the wings of god
[1:12:25] in that pavilion where he's talking
[1:12:27] about when when
[1:12:28] when trouble comes to try to find him
[1:12:31] god will hide him in this
[1:12:33] in this shelter in this place under the
[1:12:35] wings of god
[1:12:37] now i want to read a few of the
[1:12:38] scriptures too to bring this a little
[1:12:40] more to light but just think of that for
[1:12:42] a moment
[1:12:42] this these three structures that he's
[1:12:45] talking about
[1:12:46] and the all three serve a different
[1:12:47] purpose for a different reason
[1:12:50] amen but every one of them come about to
[1:12:53] help us
[1:12:53] understand all of it is in god right
[1:12:57] all of it's in christ every bit of these
[1:12:59] things is in
[1:13:01] is in christ which is where the bride is
[1:13:04] going to be
[1:13:05] in this last day before the rapture
[1:13:07] takes place
[1:13:08] she's going to be hid in christ amen
[1:13:13] in that pavilion in that shelter under
[1:13:16] his wings protected
[1:13:19] the time of trouble god will protect me
[1:13:22] hide me in that pavilion
[1:13:23] in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:13:27] shall he hide me the secret what does
[1:13:30] that mean that means that not
[1:13:31] everybody's going to know about it
[1:13:34] it's only going to be privy to those who
[1:13:36] are his that he reveals it to
[1:13:39] those that he shows it to a a tabernacle
[1:13:43] is a less
[1:13:43] permanent place of worship just like a
[1:13:46] temple is
[1:13:47] is uh just think about the tabernacle in
[1:13:50] the wilderness
[1:13:51] right the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:13:53] god specifically built
[1:13:55] so that they could put it up and take it
[1:13:57] down and move it where and whenever they
[1:13:58] wanted to
[1:13:59] right as the holy spirit now now i hope
[1:14:02] you understand the spiritual application
[1:14:04] here
[1:14:04] when the holy spirit came as it did and
[1:14:07] it led the children of israel by
[1:14:09] a pillar of fire at night by a cloud by
[1:14:11] day as it led them along
[1:14:14] they had to be mobile enough to take
[1:14:16] their tabernacle
[1:14:18] and and draw it all together fold it all
[1:14:20] up and pack it
[1:14:21] and take it with them so they could
[1:14:23] follow god wherever he took them
[1:14:27] and then wherever god set them they'd
[1:14:29] set their tabernacle back home again
[1:14:32] and they had their place that they go
[1:14:33] into the inner court the outer court and
[1:14:35] then the holy sephony
[1:14:37] it was still a place of worship right
[1:14:40] but it was that progress that god
[1:14:42] the place that god had them to put that
[1:14:45] in there in that secret of the
[1:14:47] tabernacle
[1:14:49] that god's hiding us it's
[1:14:52] it's a place that not everybody knows
[1:14:55] about
[1:14:56] so if it's not everybody knows about
[1:14:58] it's not this building
[1:15:00] right amen because people know about
[1:15:03] this building
[1:15:04] i may not be a whole lot know about it
[1:15:05] now but they will eventually come to
[1:15:07] know in the city of tucson they'll know
[1:15:09] that this is a place that has a church
[1:15:11] in it
[1:15:12] they'll come to know that but this
[1:15:14] secret is a place that only god's chosen
[1:15:17] know about
[1:15:18] yeah right that it's revealed to them
[1:15:21] this is where you go
[1:15:22] so when you're in trouble where do you
[1:15:24] go when you're in need
[1:15:26] where do you go when you're in
[1:15:28] desperation
[1:15:30] where do you go amen you know where you
[1:15:33] go
[1:15:33] and god takes you and puts you in that
[1:15:36] place
[1:15:36] so even satan can't even get to you yeah
[1:15:39] right
[1:15:40] amen satan can't even get to you
[1:15:43] and he'll and he'll set me upon that
[1:15:45] rock and the rock of christ of course
[1:15:47] christ is the word
[1:15:49] amen all the way through this you can
[1:15:51] read you can see
[1:15:52] all the way through this that's where
[1:15:54] god sets us
[1:15:56] but now look what brother branham said
[1:15:57] here in the adoption in the adoption
[1:15:59] message number four
[1:16:02] i'll read the whole quote he said now
[1:16:04] remember we went through it this morning
[1:16:06] you wasn't saved by the blood you were
[1:16:08] kept saved by the blood
[1:16:11] but you were saved by grace through
[1:16:14] faith
[1:16:14] believing it god knocked at your heart's
[1:16:17] door because he predestinated you
[1:16:19] you looked up and believed it and
[1:16:21] accepted it and that's why he
[1:16:23] predestined
[1:16:24] because he knew you would believe it and
[1:16:25] accept it
[1:16:27] uh accept it now the blood makes
[1:16:29] atonement
[1:16:30] for your sins remember i said god does
[1:16:32] not condemn a sinner for sinning
[1:16:34] he's a sinner to begin with he condemns
[1:16:36] a christian for sinning
[1:16:38] and then because he has condemned him
[1:16:41] christ took our condemnation
[1:16:44] so there's no condemnation to them which
[1:16:47] are in
[1:16:49] in christ jesus right amen
[1:16:52] in christ jesus now david is saying all
[1:16:55] of this
[1:16:56] not realizing christ would come
[1:16:59] believing a messiah would come but not
[1:17:01] knowing who it was and the purpose
[1:17:03] and all david didn't know that he was uh
[1:17:06] he was
[1:17:07] writing his psalms and singing his
[1:17:09] psalms by inspiration of god
[1:17:11] to what was going down the road yeah
[1:17:14] what we experienced today
[1:17:16] as he was looking forward we look back
[1:17:18] and we realized what we can see now
[1:17:20] that's jesus christ that's the holy
[1:17:23] spirit that's god moving it
[1:17:25] so god became our condemnation when he
[1:17:27] died at calvary so there is no
[1:17:29] condemnation
[1:17:30] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:17:34] david didn't know he was talking about
[1:17:36] being in christ
[1:17:37] but we know that today that's our refuge
[1:17:41] that's our strength that walk not after
[1:17:44] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:17:46] and if you do anything wrong it isn't
[1:17:48] willfully you do it you don't
[1:17:50] sin willfully a man sins willfully goes
[1:17:52] out willfully sins never comes into that
[1:17:55] body yet
[1:17:56] but a man that wants in there listen now
[1:18:00] a man that's once in there woman person
[1:18:03] once in there he's dead and his life is
[1:18:07] hidden in god through christ
[1:18:09] sealed by the holy ghost and the devil
[1:18:14] the devil can't even find him
[1:18:17] amen praise the lord you can be
[1:18:21] so lost in jesus christ you can be so
[1:18:24] hid in christ as david was speaking that
[1:18:27] satan can't even find you
[1:18:31] the devil can't even find you
[1:18:34] you saw the devils do this this the
[1:18:36] devil can only do what god allows him
[1:18:39] gets so deep into christ friend that he
[1:18:41] can't even fight
[1:18:42] amen do anything about it
[1:18:46] sealed by the holy ghost the devil can't
[1:18:48] even find him he's so far back
[1:18:51] in there he'll have to come out
[1:18:54] the person the man will have to come out
[1:18:57] before the devil can ever even get to
[1:19:00] him right
[1:19:01] praise the lord amen so lost satan can't
[1:19:04] even find him
[1:19:05] sow him as dead as david said so hid
[1:19:08] in that secret place
[1:19:12] that the enemy can't even find it when
[1:19:14] i'm in trouble
[1:19:16] when i'm distressed when an enemy comes
[1:19:18] up against me
[1:19:19] in the time of trouble god will set me
[1:19:22] upon that rock
[1:19:23] amen praise the lord that rock is christ
[1:19:27] and hide me so far in christ
[1:19:30] i can be so lost in jesus that satan
[1:19:33] can't even find
[1:19:36] amen praise the lord that's where i
[1:19:38] desire to be friend
[1:19:40] amen that's where i want to be so lost
[1:19:42] in christ satan can't find me
[1:19:44] now over in psalms 91 see how
[1:19:47] david follows this up
[1:19:57] we'll move past psalms 27 in our
[1:20:00] scripture reading
[1:20:01] but don't move past it for the rest of
[1:20:05] today or even maybe the next service or
[1:20:07] two
[1:20:07] keep in mind psalms 27
[1:20:11] why brother branham used that as the
[1:20:14] rapture
[1:20:15] scripture amen the place that we were in
[1:20:20] and i'll show you before we leave here
[1:20:21] today my time's already getting away
[1:20:24] but before we leave here today i want to
[1:20:25] read that scripture even if it's just a
[1:20:27] portion of it because we'll
[1:20:29] follow back up with it maybe next time
[1:20:31] and and see
[1:20:33] where brother branham was taking this
[1:20:35] from amen
[1:20:37] now psalms 91 we'll see what david says
[1:20:39] here to follow this up
[1:20:42] psalms 91 1 he that dwelleth in the
[1:20:46] secret place of the most high shall
[1:20:48] abide under the shadow of the almighty
[1:20:51] sound kind of familiar
[1:20:54] praise the lord i will say of the lord
[1:20:56] he is my refuge and my fortress there's
[1:21:00] another
[1:21:01] there's another habitation another
[1:21:03] dwelling place a fortress
[1:21:05] amen my god in him will i trust
[1:21:09] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:21:11] snare of the fowler and from the
[1:21:14] noisome pestilence he shall cover thee
[1:21:17] with his feathers and utter his wings
[1:21:20] shalt thou
[1:21:21] trust his truth shall be thy shield
[1:21:24] and buckler thou shalt not be
[1:21:28] afraid for the terror by night nor for
[1:21:30] the arrow that flieth by day
[1:21:32] whatever arrow satan tries to pierce you
[1:21:35] with
[1:21:36] amen nor for the pestilence
[1:21:40] that walketh in darkness nor for the
[1:21:43] destruction
[1:21:44] that wastes us at noonday friend if i
[1:21:48] didn't think
[1:21:49] that david didn't have a revelation of
[1:21:51] what we were going to go through this
[1:21:53] past year
[1:21:54] i just i just don't know anything right
[1:21:57] a pestilence that walketh in darkness
[1:22:00] yeah
[1:22:01] i mean fred we've gone through it as a
[1:22:03] human
[1:22:04] uh species so many different pestilences
[1:22:08] and diseases and things yeah but you
[1:22:11] ever know the one that's been walking in
[1:22:13] the
[1:22:14] darkness seemingly like this one right
[1:22:18] even from its origin there's
[1:22:21] there's a whole half of our federal
[1:22:24] government that seems less than
[1:22:26] interested in even finding out where
[1:22:27] this thing came from
[1:22:30] talk about darkness talk about the
[1:22:34] the place where it came from that we
[1:22:36] know
[1:22:38] amen you want to talk about darkness oh
[1:22:41] goodness
[1:22:43] there is no liberty there the communist
[1:22:45] state
[1:22:47] news tells them what they want people to
[1:22:49] hear they're not going to tell you the
[1:22:50] truth
[1:22:51] i've always thought you know in my adult
[1:22:53] state i've always thought it was sort of
[1:22:55] comical
[1:22:55] when we as a country try to make these
[1:22:58] agreements with godless countries
[1:23:00] how can you make an agreement with a
[1:23:02] russia or china or iran
[1:23:03] when those people couldn't care it means
[1:23:05] absolutely nothing to them to lie to
[1:23:08] your face
[1:23:08] yeah nothing they couldn't care less
[1:23:11] there's no
[1:23:11] uh uh god there's no moral or there's no
[1:23:16] compass that says i gotta tell the truth
[1:23:18] to this man right
[1:23:20] it's not there yeah so if it's not there
[1:23:23] you're just dropping in darkness
[1:23:25] hoping thinking maybe they're going to
[1:23:27] do this that the other
[1:23:28] man it was born out of darkness
[1:23:31] right it hides in darkness where does
[1:23:34] the darkness come from
[1:23:36] that's not of god god is light
[1:23:39] the darkness is satan
[1:23:42] so if it's in darkness then you know
[1:23:44] it's of the devil
[1:23:46] this pestilence that comes in the
[1:23:49] darkness
[1:23:50] but where does god's sheltering us see
[1:23:52] as david said here
[1:23:54] under his wings amen god's protecting us
[1:23:57] and keeping us you remember the story
[1:23:58] brother branham told about that when
[1:24:00] he was uh up in the mountains and saw
[1:24:02] this eat his nest and little babies
[1:24:03] playing down
[1:24:04] and he said he heard the thunder uh
[1:24:07] roaring off in the distance
[1:24:09] he said as soon as that thing got close
[1:24:11] he heard that mama eagle lay out a
[1:24:13] stream and street
[1:24:14] and she come piercing down through there
[1:24:17] um
[1:24:18] however fast piercing down through there
[1:24:20] and she swooped down above those
[1:24:22] above the ground and those little eagle
[1:24:24] lifts just clamped onto her wings and
[1:24:26] she just pierced right up to that nest
[1:24:28] and took him up into safety amen
[1:24:31] my friend if that's not exactly the
[1:24:33] epitome of the scripture that david said
[1:24:35] here
[1:24:35] i don't know what it is amen that's
[1:24:38] beautiful and he said
[1:24:39] he saw this he actually personally this
[1:24:42] isn't something you read in the book
[1:24:43] printer song
[1:24:44] national geographic he saw this that
[1:24:47] eagle coming
[1:24:48] and picked them babies up they clamped
[1:24:50] onto her wings and then babies hanging
[1:24:52] on her wings she just pierced right back
[1:24:54] up to that nest again to keep them safe
[1:24:56] from the storm
[1:24:58] amen that's exactly what god's got for
[1:25:00] us
[1:25:01] that's who he is to us amen that was his
[1:25:03] illustration that was the point of it
[1:25:05] what god does for us pestilence walking
[1:25:08] in darkness
[1:25:09] but what it's not it's an arrow but it
[1:25:12] doesn't pierce us
[1:25:14] right amen that walketh in darkness
[1:25:17] nor for the destruction that wastes us
[1:25:19] at noon day
[1:25:21] a thousand shall fall at thy sight and
[1:25:24] ten at thy right side amen
[1:25:28] devils have no no chance friend
[1:25:31] but it shall not come nigh thee
[1:25:34] only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
[1:25:37] and see the reward of the wicked
[1:25:40] amen god will protect his own amen
[1:25:43] god takes his home too well i i know
[1:25:45] there's people that's
[1:25:47] that that's died from it well as far as
[1:25:48] i know people have died from cover
[1:25:50] yeah and i and i know maybe something to
[1:25:53] happen
[1:25:55] and and but i'll tell you this
[1:25:59] i still don't fear it i don't fear it
[1:26:01] right more than i do
[1:26:03] you tell brother brown cancer to brother
[1:26:05] green
[1:26:06] or as far as we know amen i don't ever
[1:26:08] know if there was a cause of death
[1:26:10] anybody know but
[1:26:11] uh we know it had cancer and he passed
[1:26:13] away but
[1:26:14] he passed away because it's god's time
[1:26:16] to take it right
[1:26:18] i was reading through these quotes and i
[1:26:19] was gonna print it but i didn't he said
[1:26:21] the devil wants to brother graham says
[1:26:22] the devil wants to take you but satan
[1:26:24] can't touch me until god is done with
[1:26:25] him
[1:26:26] amen well that's not just brother brown
[1:26:28] that applies to brother green that
[1:26:30] applies to you
[1:26:30] right amen so i don't fear cancer
[1:26:32] anymore and i fear the other
[1:26:34] yes right right amen i don't fear that
[1:26:37] doesn't scare me amen
[1:26:40] that's just a device fear is the device
[1:26:43] of the devil
[1:26:44] so it doesn't i don't fear of it any
[1:26:48] more than i do the other
[1:26:49] you know brother man wrote the book do
[1:26:50] you fear cancer because
[1:26:52] so many people were wracked with fear of
[1:26:54] cancer
[1:26:55] some people so much so that they
[1:26:57] actually begin to develop the symptoms
[1:26:59] of cancer
[1:27:00] even though they didn't have it just
[1:27:02] because they feared it so much
[1:27:04] and people do the same thing today i
[1:27:06] still see people
[1:27:08] i still see people walking down the
[1:27:10] street
[1:27:11] a thousand yards from the closest person
[1:27:13] with a mask on
[1:27:15] amen and they probably have they
[1:27:18] probably had their vaccine
[1:27:20] not an inoculation there's a difference
[1:27:22] mike has taught me that
[1:27:24] there's a difference in an inoculation
[1:27:26] in a vaccine your cellian is an
[1:27:27] inoculation but it's not
[1:27:29] right it's just a vaccine and these they
[1:27:32] probably had shots
[1:27:33] and they still walk down the street and
[1:27:35] that's their privilege that's fine
[1:27:37] i'm not belittling these people right at
[1:27:39] all understanding
[1:27:40] and the people that are living in fear
[1:27:42] and all that i'm not belittling those
[1:27:44] people because there can only live to
[1:27:46] what they have and what they know
[1:27:48] amen so i don't do that but but it helps
[1:27:50] us helps you understand
[1:27:52] what's going on remember we're talking
[1:27:55] about the resulting
[1:27:57] the condition in the world at the time
[1:27:59] of a rapture
[1:28:01] amen at the time of rapture
[1:28:04] what god is doing in this world today
[1:28:07] how things are unfolding
[1:28:09] now let's finish our thought here
[1:28:10] because i got to close
[1:28:12] i don't have to but colossians chapter 3
[1:28:16] but i do want to finish this thought
[1:28:19] colossians chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:28:28] colossians 3 1. if you then be risen
[1:28:31] with christ
[1:28:32] seek those things which are above where
[1:28:35] christ sitteth on the right hand of god
[1:28:37] set your affection on things above not
[1:28:39] on things
[1:28:40] on the earth right for ye are dead
[1:28:43] amen and your life is hid
[1:28:47] with christ in god now that's just
[1:28:51] exactly the quote we just read it's
[1:28:53] exactly what brother adam was saying
[1:28:55] i am dead you are dead we are dead and
[1:28:57] our life
[1:28:58] is hid with christ in god hid
[1:29:02] what does it mean to be hidden it means
[1:29:04] that nobody can find you
[1:29:07] or the person that you don't want to
[1:29:09] find you can't find it
[1:29:10] yeah as a kid he's played hide and go
[1:29:14] seek like you found a good hiding place
[1:29:17] they couldn't find you
[1:29:19] we had a big neighborhood it was dark
[1:29:22] kids hide all over the place you know
[1:29:25] you couldn't find them but it wasn't
[1:29:28] they
[1:29:28] they hid so you couldn't find them amen
[1:29:32] a little different now when i play hide
[1:29:33] and go seek with joel or emma
[1:29:35] you know i hide behind the door you know
[1:29:37] it's just pretty easy to find them
[1:29:40] not very many places to hide in a little
[1:29:41] apartment anyway but
[1:29:43] you know what i'm saying when you hide
[1:29:44] you hide where you can't be found
[1:29:47] that's the point god has the scripture
[1:29:49] here where he
[1:29:51] dead in him hid with christ in god
[1:29:55] amen caught up in heavenly places
[1:29:59] caught up yes when christ when christ
[1:30:03] who is our life shall appear
[1:30:05] then shall ye also appear with him where
[1:30:08] in glory
[1:30:09] amen we shall appear with him glory now
[1:30:12] i want to bring this
[1:30:14] this the story second kings
[1:30:17] chapter 6.
[1:30:22] second kings chapter six we all remember
[1:30:24] this story
[1:30:26] i used it as a reference here a few
[1:30:28] months ago
[1:30:30] of elisha at dothan
[1:30:34] and the syrian army the syrian king
[1:30:35] trying to come after
[1:30:37] elisha uh the king of syria sends down
[1:30:42] uh an army down to go capture
[1:30:45] elisha and try to get out of him what he
[1:30:49] did to
[1:30:50] bewitch the people to uh tell him his
[1:30:53] secrets of how he knows what the king's
[1:30:55] saying even in his bed chamber
[1:30:59] well we know what happens when the enemy
[1:31:00] gets there
[1:31:02] second kings chapter 6 verse 13.
[1:31:05] our reading begin with verse 13. and he
[1:31:08] said go and spy where he is that i may
[1:31:10] sin and fetch him
[1:31:12] and it was told him saying behold he is
[1:31:14] independent
[1:31:15] therefore in heat there are horses and
[1:31:17] chariots and great hosts
[1:31:19] and they came by night could pass the
[1:31:21] city about
[1:31:22] and when the servant of the man of god
[1:31:24] was risen early gone forth behold the
[1:31:26] host
[1:31:27] compassed the city both with horses and
[1:31:30] chariots now you can see the scene
[1:31:32] they're sitting there elisha and
[1:31:34] servants and and the syrian army has
[1:31:36] come
[1:31:37] passed around about them all the way
[1:31:39] around no escape horses
[1:31:42] chariots capacity his servant said unto
[1:31:46] him alas my master
[1:31:47] what shall we do and he answered fear
[1:31:51] not
[1:31:52] for they that be with us are more
[1:31:55] than they that be with them right is
[1:31:57] that true today
[1:31:58] amen you better believe this yes if i
[1:32:01] can only give you one scriptural
[1:32:03] reference to help you understand
[1:32:05] forget about the power necessarily but
[1:32:07] the number
[1:32:09] the number of course the power obviously
[1:32:12] god
[1:32:12] outpowers the temple well it's not even
[1:32:15] comparable
[1:32:16] you can say darkness from light but
[1:32:18] that's not even comparable to how much
[1:32:20] power god has been saved
[1:32:22] but just think about the number if i
[1:32:23] could just give you a scripture
[1:32:24] reference just on number
[1:32:25] when satan deceived the angels of heaven
[1:32:27] he took one third
[1:32:30] that means it was 230 didn't deceive
[1:32:32] right so even if you just think
[1:32:34] scripturally of the deception
[1:32:36] of the comparison of the numbers angels
[1:32:38] that's that's two to one
[1:32:40] yeah amen that's a simple man
[1:32:43] fear not for they to be with us more
[1:32:45] than they would be with them
[1:32:47] and elisha prayed and said lord i pray
[1:32:50] thee open his eyes that he may see
[1:32:53] and the lord opened the eyes of the
[1:32:54] young man and he saw and behold the
[1:32:56] mountain
[1:32:57] was full of horses and chariots of fire
[1:33:00] round about a life
[1:33:02] and that's great you think wow that's
[1:33:05] wonderful
[1:33:06] the bow is on well they didn't even have
[1:33:08] to battle
[1:33:10] this was an easy battle so they got
[1:33:12] horses and chariots
[1:33:13] yeah but there's more of us with us than
[1:33:15] there are with them
[1:33:17] but they didn't even employ themselves
[1:33:19] look what god does
[1:33:20] and elijah god does through elijah
[1:33:27] and when they came down to him elisha
[1:33:29] prayed unto the lord and said
[1:33:31] smite these people i pray thee with
[1:33:34] blindness
[1:33:35] and he spoke them with blindness
[1:33:36] according to the word of elijah and
[1:33:38] elisha said unto them
[1:33:39] this is not the way neither is this the
[1:33:41] city follow me and i will bring you to
[1:33:43] the man whom you seek
[1:33:44] but he led them to sumerian it came to
[1:33:46] pass when they were in samaria
[1:33:48] that elisha said lord open the eyes of
[1:33:50] these men and that they may
[1:33:51] that they may see and the lord opened
[1:33:53] their eyes and they saw behold there was
[1:33:55] they were in the midst of samaria
[1:33:57] it was that simple you say well there's
[1:34:00] more with us and they're all with them
[1:34:01] greater is he that said they but have
[1:34:03] just simply said god just blind their
[1:34:04] eyes
[1:34:06] when they get down here lord just have
[1:34:08] their eyes blinded
[1:34:10] and god blind in their eyes so that when
[1:34:12] they got down there where was
[1:34:14] uh where was elijah he was in a secret
[1:34:17] place
[1:34:18] he was hid away yes i say
[1:34:22] hid away in plain view right amen
[1:34:26] he was right there but they couldn't see
[1:34:28] him
[1:34:30] it's like the reference we talked about
[1:34:31] from the free real free will
[1:34:33] series when we talked about the
[1:34:35] blindness of israel
[1:34:37] god didn't purposely come and and smite
[1:34:41] them with
[1:34:41] and say okay you're not gonna see this
[1:34:45] they were so blinded by their
[1:34:47] preconceived notions
[1:34:49] of how they thought the messiah was
[1:34:51] going to come that when he come they
[1:34:53] dissed him
[1:34:54] right they couldn't see him he was hid
[1:34:57] in plain view
[1:34:58] elisha was hid in plain view you can be
[1:35:02] so hid in christ that satan can't even
[1:35:05] find you
[1:35:05] yes kid in plain view amen
[1:35:10] blind their eyes it's only to be
[1:35:11] revealed it's only for those
[1:35:14] who god chooses and if it's only for
[1:35:16] those who god chooses then what is there
[1:35:18] to worry about
[1:35:19] even when the enemy comes in even when
[1:35:21] the enemy compasses about
[1:35:24] god's blind their eyes eyes were blinded
[1:35:27] he said oh come on i'll show you who

[1:35:49] stood up to this city he went on out and
[1:35:51] he said okay god open around
[1:35:53] he opened their eyes and looked around
[1:35:54] and said how do we get here
[1:35:56] right because god hit it hit him and
[1:35:58] playing you
[1:35:59] right be so lost in christ satan can't

[1:36:22] they was so
[1:36:23] true to god he's talking about israel

[1:36:38] so close to god till the devil don't
[1:36:41] know what to do with him
[1:36:43] the devil don't even know what to do
[1:36:45] with him amen
[1:36:48] elisha said the devil come down to life

[1:37:05] their eyes and they're like
[1:37:06] where how did we get here we had the man
[1:37:08] surrounded
[1:37:09] how did we get here because god
[1:37:14] what is the rapture and condition of the
[1:37:17] world today
[1:37:19] think of it what what is the scriptural
[1:37:22] rapture and condition
[1:37:23] does it compare to what's going on today
[1:37:26] does the condition of the world our
[1:37:28] country does it compare with
[1:37:29] scriptural references of what the bible
[1:37:32] says is going to be when the rapture
[1:37:33] takes place
[1:37:36] i'm going to read this real quick i'm
[1:37:37] going to read a couple of the verses
[1:37:38] here i'm not going to read as much as i
[1:37:40] was going to because i'm going to quote
[1:37:43] but after brother branham reads psalms
[1:37:46] 27 1-5
[1:37:50] he gives a brief comment and then he
[1:37:53] goes
[1:37:53] right to this scripture now this is not
[1:37:57] a trivia class
[1:37:58] but you know where he went do you
[1:37:59] remember where the rapture messes where
[1:38:01] he went
[1:38:02] second peter second peter chapter three
[1:38:06] and i'm going to read just a couple of
[1:38:08] verses of scripture here because this
[1:38:10] follows
[1:38:10] up just like brother branham did in the
[1:38:12] rapture message this follows up
[1:38:15] what brother brown read in psalms 27 1-5
[1:38:20] keep that in mind second peter 3.
[1:38:30] or read verse one through four
[1:38:35] second peter three one through four
[1:38:40] so glad say come around say
[1:38:46] you know you know she's trying to put
[1:38:48] that fear back on brother dennis too
[1:38:51] amen that doctor just something simple
[1:38:54] i mean people have things in their
[1:38:56] bodies and all
[1:38:58] you know but you see how that guy comes
[1:38:59] oh it's it's probably cancer again you
[1:39:01] got
[1:39:01] cancer you're going to go through the
[1:39:02] chemo set all this up nearly
[1:39:04] and you know you see how he's got to
[1:39:06] scare him it's just the devil
[1:39:09] he's just a devil amen second peter 3 1
[1:39:13] this second epistle beloved i now write
[1:39:15] unto you in both which i stir up your
[1:39:17] pure minds by the way of remembrance
[1:39:19] that you may be mindful of the words
[1:39:21] which were spoken before by the holy
[1:39:23] prophets and of the commandment of us
[1:39:24] the apostles of our lord
[1:39:26] as the lord and savior knowing this
[1:39:29] first that this is where brother branham
[1:39:30] started now
[1:39:31] just after he reads psalms 27 1-5 he
[1:39:35] reads this
[1:39:36] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:39:39] in the
[1:39:40] last days scoffers
[1:39:43] walking after their own lust and saying
[1:39:46] where's the promise of his coming
[1:39:48] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:39:50] things continue as they were from the
[1:39:51] beginning of creation now we'll go
[1:39:53] through this whole
[1:39:54] chapter but we'll stop there and see
[1:39:56] where brother brown then
[1:39:58] majored on that word stoppers and he
[1:40:01] talked about
[1:40:01] the scoffers and those that were of that
[1:40:04] time when he was here
[1:40:06] 55 years ago this was preached 55 years
[1:40:09] ago 54 over 55
[1:40:11] 55 and a half years ago he preached this
[1:40:14] and the scoffers that there were look
[1:40:17] those scoffers
[1:40:19] that uh that would come in this last
[1:40:22] days
[1:40:22] walking after their own lust
[1:40:26] now if if that's not an example if
[1:40:30] that's not a
[1:40:33] an exact description of what we see
[1:40:36] and i'll just save this country at least
[1:40:38] because it probably gets rest world's
[1:40:40] probably worse
[1:40:41] of what's going on in this world today
[1:40:44] the sculptures you ever seen or heard
[1:40:46] the way it is today of the scoffers yes
[1:40:50] talk to people i've heard i've heard
[1:40:52] witnesses that brother tom's give me at
[1:40:54] the gym show
[1:40:55] where he tries to talk to people and
[1:40:57] they just scoff
[1:40:59] and laugh and make fun and put him down
[1:41:02] and
[1:41:03] oh how could you be so stupid how could
[1:41:05] you be so ignorant
[1:41:06] and of course laced with profanity
[1:41:10] right because most of these people don't
[1:41:12] know how to talk like a decent normal
[1:41:14] human being anymore
[1:41:19] oh where is he and there's nothing to
[1:41:21] that you people been saying that for
[1:41:23] year after year
[1:41:24] it's been so many years now my
[1:41:26] granddaddy said that my daddy said that
[1:41:28] and that was dedicated to
[1:41:30] where is it now and you go looking
[1:41:34] almost anywhere you go and it's the same
[1:41:36] thing
[1:41:37] and these and these scoffers
[1:41:40] these scoffers that that deny
[1:41:44] what we know is the truth
[1:41:48] not only are we hidden christ but the
[1:41:51] truth
[1:41:52] is hidden from those people right but
[1:41:54] this condition
[1:41:56] because again the direction that god
[1:41:58] gave brother branham for
[1:42:00] uh psalms 27 is the same god that gave
[1:42:04] him direction that
[1:42:04] a comment later to read this scripture
[1:42:08] so i believe that is something that we
[1:42:10] look to
[1:42:11] to understand what the world's condition
[1:42:14] will be like
[1:42:15] when the rapture takes place his coming
[1:42:18] at the resurrection of the dead and
[1:42:22] so then my question then are we there
[1:42:26] i believe we are are we completely there
[1:42:30] is a different story right amen i
[1:42:32] believe we're there
[1:42:33] absolutely there but i know brother adam
[1:42:36] said several times
[1:42:38] i see nothing less spiritual need to
[1:42:40] happen but the coming of the lord yes
[1:42:42] which includes of course the
[1:42:44] resurrection of the dead and
[1:42:46] the process that goes with that amen
[1:42:50] so if it was that waste 55 years ago
[1:42:52] what is it now
[1:42:54] and we look and see how much worse it's
[1:42:56] gotten friend
[1:42:57] and it's gotten to the place that if you
[1:42:59] don't accept
[1:43:01] because you know they're they're they're
[1:43:04] a hair of feathers width away
[1:43:07] from taking away the first amendment in
[1:43:09] this country if they do
[1:43:12] then it's all about thinking the way
[1:43:15] everybody else thinks and if you don't
[1:43:17] think the way they think
[1:43:18] you're the enemy and only to be left to
[1:43:20] be destroyed
[1:43:22] killed because you have no use if you
[1:43:24] don't think the way they think
[1:43:26] right amen that way of thinking
[1:43:29] satan's eden is of the devil right it's
[1:43:32] of the world
[1:43:33] yeah which is which is
[1:43:36] sets in the process for the tribulation
[1:43:38] so where are we
[1:43:41] because the bride leaves before the
[1:43:42] tribulation yeah rapture takes place
[1:43:45] which is another facet of what i want to
[1:43:46] get into of course the
[1:43:48] rapture is before the tribulation a lot
[1:43:50] of people don't even believe that
[1:43:52] even christians don't believe the
[1:43:53] rapture for the tribulation
[1:43:55] but if we see that condition and why
[1:43:57] brother branham preached that the way he
[1:43:59] did
[1:44:00] i believe it was for that time and i
[1:44:01] believe he preached it for that service
[1:44:04] and for those people
[1:44:05] he was gonna preach it at jack morris
[1:44:06] church and god held him off and had it
[1:44:09] come to yuma
[1:44:10] i don't know why they never know why but
[1:44:12] that was for a reason friend
[1:44:13] yeah and it brought it to that point to
[1:44:16] that place for a purpose
[1:44:17] and it was for us today i believe as
[1:44:19] much as it was then
[1:44:22] because i believe out of at that point
[1:44:25] at that time right now is the live and
[1:44:26] remain groups coming
[1:44:28] amen i believe that i believe we're that
[1:44:30] yeah
[1:44:32] whatever the lord that's right i i may
[1:44:34] not live to see it program said that too
[1:44:36] we may none of us i don't know maybe the
[1:44:38] little ones but
[1:44:40] it's here amen i believe i'm yes
[1:44:44] i believe i will i believe with that
[1:44:45] quote
[1:44:47] and i believe the conditions of the
[1:44:49] world today matches almost
[1:44:51] letter for letter and we'll there's more
[1:44:53] in there too
[1:44:54] of exactly what the scripture says it
[1:44:56] would be amen
[1:44:57] amen praise the thank god to give us a
[1:45:01] place of
[1:45:02] hiding yeah amen a place of hiding in
[1:45:06] him
[1:45:06] and a place to come into and get away
[1:45:08] from all that
[1:45:10] stay away from all the bible amen got a
[1:45:12] special prayer request too
[1:45:14] i'm closing here i want us to join
[1:45:17] together
[1:45:18] and pray and i don't mean just you know
[1:45:21] hear i just mean
[1:45:22] in prayer together that god rid us of
[1:45:25] that place next door they just moved
[1:45:27] down
[1:45:27] at the same time we're moving in a
[1:45:29] tattoo parlor's moving in next door
[1:45:32] so we we got some
[1:45:36] warrior faith to break out amen
[1:45:39] to get rid of that place amen i believe
[1:45:42] you can do it you
[1:45:43] oh yeah absolutely amen
[1:45:47] me and my parents when i was growing up
[1:45:49] uh we
[1:45:50] were in a little storefront like this
[1:45:53] three or four units
[1:45:54] and uh a like a bar or sports drill or
[1:45:57] something was next door and smoke would
[1:45:59] come through the walls and it stumps the
[1:46:01] bag and it was loud and
[1:46:02] things of course these these were kind
[1:46:04] of pentecostal people so the loud thing
[1:46:06] didn't bother very much
[1:46:09] i think we were always louder than the
[1:46:11] bar was but
[1:46:13] uh but we prayed about it we got
[1:46:15] together joined in faith and what long
[1:46:17] that place is gone
[1:46:18] yeah i believe god do the same thing
[1:46:20] here i don't care if he's just moved in
[1:46:22] don't care place over here is in
[1:46:34] but that's just that's just another one
[1:46:36] of those things about it
[1:46:42] people have gotten so washed down they
[1:46:44] they don't even see things like that as
[1:46:45] being
[1:46:46] undogging that that doesn't mean
[1:46:49] anything
[1:46:50] people go to all kinds of churches and
[1:46:52] they're just just
[1:46:53] desecrated the temple of god you know
[1:46:57] with all that they don't see anything
[1:46:59] wrong with that it doesn't mean anything
[1:47:01] to them
[1:47:02] amen but we do
[1:47:05] we know that there is the spirits that
[1:47:07] come with that
[1:47:09] amen amen is
