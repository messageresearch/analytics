[40:53] be 110 next week
[40:56] so so it's good I don't have to rush out
[40:59] of here but it's bad that it's going to
[41:01] be hot next week so at least a couple of
[41:04] the days so I appreciate your prayers I
[41:06] went over to the job site Friday and uh
[41:09] it looked like they had done pretty good
[41:11] uh all the outside work except for the
[41:13] stuff Under The Canopy is
[41:15] done those few things could be done in
[41:18] the morning when it's cooler so uh it
[41:21] shouldn't be too rough a week but U we
[41:24] found I was joking with the crew but
[41:27] uh sent him a text of a rental for one
[41:30] of those big huge swamp
[41:33] coolers and actually one of the guys on
[41:36] the team who's worked in the warehouse
[41:37] says we have one of those nobody's using
[41:39] it so he went last week and picked it up
[41:42] and took it to the job site so we have a
[41:45] little bit of something uh when we work
[41:47] up north and it's really cold it's cold
[41:50] outside it's really cold I you know but
[41:53] uh up there they Clos the ends of the
[41:55] tunnels and they put heaters inside so
[41:57] if you get really cold you just go in
[41:58] and warm up but when it's hot like this
[42:00] there's unless you get in your car or
[42:02] something there's no place to go to cool
[42:04] off it's just hot it's just hot it's
[42:06] always hot so uh appreciate your prayers
[42:10] about that too so we drink a lot of
[42:12] water try to stay hydrated but
[42:15] appreciate your prayers about that too
[42:17] amen so anybody have unspoken
[42:20] request Lord knows all of our needs to

[42:38] and to serve you with all that's in our

[42:44] it's so true there's so many that are
[42:49] just fighting to um line up with your

[42:56] where Paul said you cannot eat drink the
[43:00] cup of devils and drink the cup of the
[43:03] Lord you cannot Feast the table of the
[43:07] Lord and feast at the table of the

[44:23] their lives and father without that Born
[44:27] Again experience no matter how much we
[44:30] can quote the message we can quote the
[44:33] scriptures we can try to live a Pious

[44:40] a hill of beans in your sight if we're
[44:42] not born again and Lord may we search
[44:46] our hearts Lord to know that your spirit
[44:51] has sealed us into that day of
[44:55] redemption that the world is sealed out

[55:48] of the same thing we can't do it

[56:08] oh yes amen Just Praise Him for that
[56:11] praise the Lord I reminds me I keep
[56:13] forget to ask prayer for M Michael
[56:16] former Barber uh Thomas uh may have
[56:20] known two three years ago I brought a
[56:22] prayer request because he had a pretty
[56:24] bad bicycle accident on Mount l he's a
[56:26] cycler uh he Cycles a lot he's usually
[56:29] cycling the tour to Tucson but he had a
[56:32] really bad crash up on Mount Limon two
[56:34] or three years ago and I get prayer
[56:36] requests but it's very possible you
[56:39] remember but anyway um everything healed
[56:43] good uh his right shoulder I think it
[56:45] was his left what is his left shoulder I
[56:47] think it's his left
[56:49] shoulder was broken in the accident and
[56:53] they plated it and screwed it and all
[56:55] this stuff stuff and uh figured
[56:57] everything was going to be fine well now
[56:59] two or three years later they come to
[57:01] find he keep kept having pain cuz he
[57:04] works like this Barber that is so he
[57:08] kept having pain so he went back and
[57:10] they finally did some more x-rays find
[57:12] out that bone is not healing itself uh
[57:16] God's not healing it's not healing it's
[57:18] not going it's not growing back together
[57:21] uh the only thing holding it together
[57:22] still is the plate and screws or
[57:24] whatever they put in there so he's had
[57:27] to retire so he retired May 31st so we
[57:31] have to find a new Barber but anyway
[57:33] um uh I I want to pray that the Lord
[57:36] would just heal him uh and touch
[57:38] him partially selfish because he because
[57:41] I talk to him and if it gets better he's
[57:44] going to come back so uh but I really
[57:47] want the Lord to just touch him because
[57:51] uh when he first started talking about
[57:52] it to me and John was about the same
[57:54] time that uh the Lord had touched my
[57:57] knees I had Joel came up and the
[57:59] brothers and touch laid hands on my
[58:03] knees which now they're just they're
[58:05] really good uh not 100% but probably 90
[58:09] uh now but and I haven't even been to PT
[58:13] in three or four weeks uh for insurance
[58:17] reasons anyway uh and so I was giving
[58:19] him that testimony about what the Lord
[58:22] did with my knees and at the same time
[58:24] John gave a testimony about his I think
[58:26] it was his shoulder uh where he went
[58:29] through a prayer line here a little
[58:30] while back and he wasn't going to but he
[58:33] felt in compelled to go through and went
[58:36] through the prayer line had his shoulder
[58:38] prayed for and when he sat down he had
[58:40] the exact same feeling I had on my knees
[58:43] after Joel prayed for me but he head on
[58:45] my knees remember I told you all that
[58:47] there was that really warm sensation in
[58:49] my knees at that time John had the same
[58:52] thing in his shoulder his shoulders been
[58:53] fine ever since and we gave Thomas these
[58:56] testimonies Thomas Catholic uh but we
[58:59] gave him these testimonies and I just I
[59:02] I really love to see that the the Lord
[59:06] move on his shoulder and heal it
[59:08] perfectly completely and and go back to
[59:11] work and be able to be with him and give
[59:13] testimony again uh to what the Lord has
[59:16] done for him so uh when you pray
[59:19] remember Thomas if you would uh again I
[59:21] keep forgetting to bring his name up
[59:23] when we have our prayer request here but
[59:24] please remember I would I would
[59:26] certainly appreciate that anyone
[59:30] else I have several I'm share them A
[59:35] real quick um we know the scripture says
[59:38] redeem the time for the days are evil um
[59:42] as much as you
[59:44] can we need to make an effort above all
[59:47] to show the Lord we want to obey his
[59:49] word we need to be in church we can feel
[59:52] his presence amen the last communion
[59:55] service we had had I felt the presence
[59:58] of the Lord uh stronger than the most
[1:00:01] service amen yes and so I stopped on the
[1:00:05] way down Oracle to get some gas and
[1:00:07] there was a young lady um seemed like

[1:00:13] different ones um you know for some
[1:00:16] change and um she went around and and

[1:00:37] um you know I love the Lord and and I
[1:00:40] told her serve the Lord with all your
[1:00:42] heart first accept him and truly make
[1:00:46] him a full part of your life oh I have

[1:04:06] God than anybody
[1:04:08] ever so it's great amen it's amazing
[1:04:13] when you become a Christian where you
[1:04:14] see you see God in everything nothing
[1:04:17] happens to your life that you don't see
[1:04:19] God yesen praise the Lord let's stand to
[1:04:22] our feet then we'll just go to the
[1:04:23] scripture now amen
[1:04:26] not not that just he's everywhere I was
[1:04:28] taught as a kid I remember when Emma's
[1:04:30] age Joel's age I was taught that God was
[1:04:33] everywhere uh you know the story brother
[1:04:35] Bram tells about uh the man going to the
[1:04:40] boy or boy fishing or something you know
[1:04:43] or the boy going to the man excuse me
[1:04:45] and uh you know I want to find God I'm
[1:04:48] trying to find God and and the the dad
[1:04:51] says go ask the preacher and the
[1:04:53] preacher says whatever and he goes and
[1:04:56] he's discouraged and he goes out and he
[1:04:58] sees this man fishing he said the man
[1:05:01] says what's what's the matter young man
[1:05:02] why are you so sad he said well I went
[1:05:04] to my dad and my preacher my pastor I've
[1:05:06] went trying to find God I can't find him
[1:05:08] anywhere and he says do you know where
[1:05:10] he is he said son that's what I've been
[1:05:12] looking at all
[1:05:13] day I've been enjoying him and looking
[1:05:16] at him all day long it's all I've been
[1:05:18] doing amen something so very simple
[1:05:21] isn't it praise the Lord but then when
[1:05:23] you become a Christian and get to the
[1:05:25] place you you don't just see him in
[1:05:27] everything you just know that he's in
[1:05:29] every single facet of your life nothing
[1:05:32] happens but what God's not in control of
[1:05:35] it amen something as simple as bringing
[1:05:37] two people together amen amen praise the
[1:05:40] Lord fir uh 2 Corinthians chapter 10 got
[1:05:44] a couple more the Lord willing couple
[1:05:46] more parts to this uh the Gateway part

[1:06:16] bit I quit taking allergy medicine I got
[1:06:18] tired of taking it so I'm just not
[1:06:21] taking it now so it may man and the
[1:06:24] Lord's blessed I've been feeling good so
[1:06:27] but every once in a while my throat good
[1:06:29] scratchier like you can probably tell or
[1:06:32] my uh nose runs a little bit but uh by
[1:06:37] his grace I'm healed amen amen let's
[1:06:40] just bow our heads another word prayer
[1:06:42] before read the word Lord Jesus again
[1:06:44] father come before your throne Lord you
[1:06:46] asked us to do that you asked us to do
[1:06:48] it boldly and we do it God believing
[1:06:51] that you are mindful of us and that Lord
[1:06:54] your hand is upon us to strengthen and
[1:06:56] bless us and Lord the testimonies we've
[1:06:58] heard and the prayer requests God has
[1:07:01] just been so good to been in the house
[1:07:02] of the Lord to this point but we know
[1:07:04] God that you have something even that
[1:07:06] much more important that you want to
[1:07:08] reveal to us and show to us through your
[1:07:10] word encourage Us by it today Lord and
[1:07:14] help us to know God that Lord you are
[1:07:16] always with us that you never leave us
[1:07:18] or forsake us and that God we want to
[1:07:21] continue to press this battle by faith
[1:07:23] trusting you Lord keeping ourselves in a
[1:07:26] place Lord that we have our faculties
[1:07:29] Lord we yield our members to you Lord
[1:07:32] yes God may your Holy Spirit continue to
[1:07:35] strengthen and bless us along the way
[1:07:37] continue to keep us in the center of
[1:07:38] your perfect will lead us and guide us
[1:07:41] Lord into your uh in all the truths of
[1:07:43] your word God we know that your word is
[1:07:46] here it is true it is forever settled in
[1:07:48] heaven God just continue to reveal it to
[1:07:51] us Lord that we ourselves become more
[1:07:54] like you Lord more in your image God
[1:07:57] that you would uh use us for the furance
[1:08:00] of your kingdom yes forgive all of our
[1:08:03] sin and iniquity bless your bride
[1:08:04] worldwide internationally wherever they
[1:08:06] are and whoever they may be Lord our
[1:08:09] precious brothers and sisters around the
[1:08:10] world that make up this mystical body of
[1:08:12] Jesus Christ we just lift them before
[1:08:15] you Lord in each one of us Lord those
[1:08:17] that are here now God those who may be
[1:08:19] watching we just committ ourselves to
[1:08:22] you the remaining part of this service
[1:08:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] Christ we pray
[1:08:27] amen 2 Corinthians chap 10 verse 5
[1:08:31] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:08:34] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:08:37] knowledge of God bringing into captivity
[1:08:41] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:08:44] you can be seated if your life I want to
[1:08:46] also bring out as we looked at this and
[1:08:49] we've read this of course as we do do a
[1:08:51] series we kind a scripture that's the
[1:08:54] theme of this uh uh of the of the series
[1:08:57] uh to try to begin with to continue to
[1:09:00] refresh our memories of what the
[1:09:02] scripture says about that particular
[1:09:04] thing that we're looking at but uh I
[1:09:07] want us to notice here that uh in in the
[1:09:10] fifth verse particularly uh that we just
[1:09:13] read it says casting down imagination
[1:09:16] every High thing exalts itself but look
[1:09:18] what it says now it doesn't say that
[1:09:20] every High thing exalted itself against
[1:09:23] God it said every High thing that
[1:09:26] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:09:29] God Amen now not that the two aren't uh
[1:09:33] uh synonymous obviously God and the
[1:09:36] knowledge of God is synonymous because
[1:09:38] to know God is to have God to uh uh to
[1:09:43] have faith in God believe God trust God
[1:09:46] God be in our lives but the knowledge of
[1:09:48] God is something very specific to the
[1:09:52] understanding of of the Mind itself
[1:09:54] which is what we're our whole subject
[1:09:56] has been about uh these five Services
[1:09:59] about the knowledge of God or that
[1:10:01] knowledge that comes into uh that comes
[1:10:04] into our mind first that we that we take
[1:10:07] in as much as we talk about and we uh
[1:10:10] major on the new birth which is a soul
[1:10:12] birth which has nothing to do with the
[1:10:14] mind uh we have to understand that of
[1:10:17] course receiving in the word of God as
[1:10:20] we read as we listen uh all that comes
[1:10:24] in through our s and through our
[1:10:26] intelligence and through our uh U
[1:10:29] hearing and and all the faculties of our
[1:10:32] body comes into our minds it comes into
[1:10:34] our minds to receive that's why uh uh
[1:10:38] that all this that exalts itself against
[1:10:40] the knowledge of God or the truth of God
[1:10:43] to understand that that would be as
[1:10:46] brother random said as we read a couple
[1:10:47] of times that that place that Satan
[1:10:50] chose uh that he would want to have
[1:10:53] control over have uh access to the mind
[1:10:57] the knowledge of God he wanted to have
[1:10:59] access to the mind to do like he did in
[1:11:02] the Garden of Eden and that was to draw
[1:11:04] doubt by bringing in a knowledge that
[1:11:07] was other than God which is exalted
[1:11:11] against the knowledge of God that's what
[1:11:14] Satan did in the G Garden of Eden when
[1:11:16] he brought that lie to Eve to the woman
[1:11:19] he brought something and then of course
[1:11:21] in transversally gave over to Adam it
[1:11:24] was a knowledge amen what he was giving
[1:11:27] her was knowledge but what he was doing
[1:11:29] is he was exalting it above or against
[1:11:32] the knowledge that Eve already had that
[1:11:34] was of God the knowledge of God was
[1:11:37] don't partake of this or you will that
[1:11:39] day you'll die amen amen and the
[1:11:42] knowledge of Satan came and exalted
[1:11:45] itself against that Amen to bring doubt
[1:11:49] into her mind and when and and when it
[1:11:52] left the knowledge of God brought in
[1:11:55] doubt when doubt came in then Faith
[1:11:58] becomes weak right uh when faith is
[1:12:01] weakened then you don't then you don't
[1:12:03] believe God uh like we should because
[1:12:06] the only way to know God the only way to
[1:12:08] believe God we have to have faith amen
[1:12:11] uh it is impossible to please God
[1:12:13] without faith so you have to have faith
[1:12:15] so when the doubt comes in when the fear
[1:12:17] comes in it kills the faith and when the
[1:12:20] faith is gone then you have nothing but
[1:12:22] a knowledge and when you have nothing
[1:12:24] but a knowledge knowled then we're in
[1:12:26] bad trouble because if it comes to my
[1:12:29] mind uh knowledge is what corrupts amen
[1:12:33] knowledge knowledge is why many people
[1:12:36] leave God because of understanding which
[1:12:40] I may be getting a little ahead of
[1:12:41] myself we're to read the scripture in
[1:12:43] just a minute but um many people leave
[1:12:46] God because of
[1:12:47] understanding amen because of their
[1:12:49] minds right how many times have you
[1:12:52] heard people say I don't understand why
[1:12:54] God
[1:12:56] great why would God allow this why would
[1:13:00] God do this why would God and see people
[1:13:03] get in their minds and they try to
[1:13:04] figure God out with what not their
[1:13:07] Spirit not their soul their mind they
[1:13:10] try to figure him out and then and then
[1:13:13] when you can't figure God out which you
[1:13:15] cannot there's no way to figure God out
[1:13:18] with your mind when they can't figure
[1:13:20] God out they say well I I just can't
[1:13:22] believe a god like that how can you
[1:13:24] serve a God Like That that how can you
[1:13:26] worship a god like that why would you uh
[1:13:28] give your life over to a god that would
[1:13:30] allow something like that to happen see
[1:13:33] they missed the whole obvious the whole
[1:13:35] context of being a Christian and what
[1:13:37] the scripture and what God's about and
[1:13:39] what humanity is about and our free
[1:13:41] moral agency amen U but the knowledge
[1:13:46] that's that's my whole point the
[1:13:48] understanding that people try to figure
[1:13:51] God out with their minds they don't try
[1:13:53] to figure God out with the scripture and
[1:13:55] try to figure them out with their minds
[1:13:57] and they don't understand why God would
[1:13:59] do something yeah why God would allow
[1:14:01] something and when they do that then
[1:14:03] people leave God because they don't
[1:14:05] grasp Romans 8:28 that God will make
[1:14:08] everything everything what we consider
[1:14:12] good what we consider bad what we
[1:14:14] consider otherwise he makes all work
[1:14:18] together for our good if we love him and
[1:14:21] that love is unconditional if you love
[1:14:23] God unconditionally you have
[1:14:25] unconditional faith and your faith
[1:14:27] brings you to the place of believing God
[1:14:30] regardless of what the circumstances
[1:14:31] look like and it came to my thought uh
[1:14:35] this week in the past couple of days
[1:14:37] I've been reading a story a little bit
[1:14:39] uh it's not really a story but just u a
[1:14:42] a media report of uh a family Pastor his
[1:14:47] wife his children they're on a
[1:14:49] vacation and something that you just
[1:14:53] probably has never happened happen in
[1:14:55] humanity and will probably never ever
[1:14:57] happen again happened to their little
[1:15:00] six-year-old girl and killed her they
[1:15:02] were playing bad mitt on the last day of
[1:15:04] their vacation and I guess one of their
[1:15:07] sons it sounds like was going to hit the
[1:15:11] bad Mitten racket broke in half and the
[1:15:14] metal part com and impaled itself and
[1:15:16] went through the girl skull and killed
[1:15:18] her as she died a few days later now how
[1:15:22] do you understand that right
[1:15:26] that's probably never happened I mean I
[1:15:28] would go out of limb and guarantee you
[1:15:30] that has never happened yeah and I could
[1:15:33] probably go out of limb and guarantee
[1:15:34] you that will never happen again but it
[1:15:37] happened to this family and the thing of
[1:15:40] it was that this little girl was so uh
[1:15:44] she kind of reminds me actually even of
[1:15:46] of Joel and Emma uh she had been asking
[1:15:50] how do you how do you get to be with God
[1:15:53] uh how do you she started asking the
[1:15:55] things uh of course the man's a pastor
[1:15:58] and you know they they teach your
[1:16:01] children about Christ and go to church
[1:16:03] and all and so they they they engulf
[1:16:07] envelop their their family their
[1:16:09] children with godliness and with
[1:16:11] Christianity and with Christ and and but
[1:16:13] she was starting to ask about being with
[1:16:16] God and going to be with God and things
[1:16:19] like that and just not long before this
[1:16:21] accident happened but when something
[1:16:24] like that happen
[1:16:26] most people would just you know why
[1:16:28] would God how can I serve a god like
[1:16:31] that you know that that kind of they
[1:16:33] start reasoning in their mind why would
[1:16:35] God allow this to happen see we don't
[1:16:38] understand God's ways right we can't
[1:16:40] explain God's ways we're never going to
[1:16:42] figure God's ways out we just believe
[1:16:45] him amen and the mind is the worst
[1:16:48] weapon the worst thing that we have that
[1:16:53] to to twist that into a way to try to
[1:16:56] bring doubt and when doubt comes in just
[1:16:59] like at that family if that family
[1:17:01] started to doubt I don't care if the
[1:17:02] man's a pastor if they're devout
[1:17:03] Christians I'm the message I don't born
[1:17:05] again I don't care what if they started
[1:17:09] getting in their minds the to doubt God
[1:17:12] about this event that took place and it
[1:17:14] just seems
[1:17:16] unfathomable then then when doubt comes
[1:17:20] in then the faith starts to reing just
[1:17:22] like fear when fear comes in the the
[1:17:25] faith starts to erode and then it just
[1:17:27] goes away and then what happens what do
[1:17:29] you have when you've lost faith in what
[1:17:31] you have amen nothing but your intellect
[1:17:35] yeah nothing but your knowledge nothing
[1:17:37] but your understanding and that will
[1:17:39] absolutely and always has and will fail
[1:17:42] you amen praise the Lord let's go over
[1:17:45] to Ephesians I kind of wanted to pick up
[1:17:47] a little if you will before we left off
[1:17:50] last week I believe if I remember right
[1:17:52] the last scripture we read Ephesians
[1:17:55] chapter
[1:17:59] 2 Ephesians chapter
[1:18:02] 2 that understanding
[1:18:06] see that
[1:18:09] understanding
[1:18:11] figuring reasoning in the mind that's
[1:18:13] why we're to cast all that down that's
[1:18:16] why we're to bring all those thoughts
[1:18:18] captive to The Obedience of the word yes
[1:18:22] amen I don't understand it
[1:18:25] uh I told I told the Lord this many
[1:18:28] times and I told him again this morning
[1:18:30] probably may never in this life know why
[1:18:34] I didn't why we didn't get to spend more
[1:18:36] time with our
[1:18:37] son why the Lord took him why I never I
[1:18:43] we'll probably never know but the the
[1:18:46] why is not
[1:18:47] important that's right it's just
[1:18:49] trusting believing having faith God
[1:18:54] making everything work together why why
[1:18:57] God chose to take that little
[1:18:59] six-year-old girl and when I saw six
[1:19:01] obviously my mind thought about him a
[1:19:03] first thing but why little six-year-old
[1:19:06] girl in that situation and and then the
[1:19:08] Lord decides to take her with the most
[1:19:12] freak accident I've probably ever heard
[1:19:14] of and i' we've all heard some pretty
[1:19:17] weird circumstances that have happened
[1:19:20] that have injured or killed people but I
[1:19:22] never heard anything to that degree
[1:19:25] before it just it just it just kind of
[1:19:27] overcame me um and made me start
[1:19:31] thinking about that that's why a lot of
[1:19:33] people leave God Amen because then they
[1:19:36] start trying to understand and try to
[1:19:38] figure it out and try to and they use
[1:19:40] their minds to do that and it takes them
[1:19:42] further and further away from God Amen
[1:19:46] Ephesians chapter 2 again I believe this
[1:19:48] is the last scripture we read uh last
[1:19:50] week and you ha he Quicken who are dead
[1:19:54] in trespasses and sins wherein in time
[1:19:58] past you walked according to the course
[1:20:00] of this world according to the prince of
[1:20:03] the power of the air the spirit that now
[1:20:07] worketh in the children of
[1:20:09] Disobedience
[1:20:10] amen which is the spirit that comes
[1:20:13] against your mind that we just read in 2
[1:20:18] Corinthians among whom also we all had
[1:20:21] our conversation in times past in the
[1:20:25] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[1:20:28] of the Flesh and of the Mind fulfilling
[1:20:32] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[1:20:35] and were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:20:38] even as others amen consecrate me now
[1:20:43] amen all my nature refined Amen to Jesus
[1:20:49] is the only thing I see till Jesus is
[1:20:52] the only thing there Jesus is the only
[1:20:54] only influence in my life Jesus is the
[1:20:58] one that has the complete total control
[1:21:00] the life of God in Me amen that lives
[1:21:03] through me praise the Lord the the
[1:21:06] nature amen remember the Soul's the
[1:21:08] nature of the spirit brother brand
[1:21:10] teaches us Soul's the nature of the
[1:21:12] spirit so if the soul is God then that
[1:21:14] nature is going to permeate itself into
[1:21:17] your spirit and in and into your flesh
[1:21:20] praise the Lord but at this time we were
[1:21:23] born in s shap the iniquity come in the
[1:21:26] world speaking lies amen our minds our
[1:21:29] nature was to
[1:21:31] obey sin to live in sin amen our minds
[1:21:36] our thoughts didn't even think anything
[1:21:38] about it as you become Christian become
[1:21:41] born again it becomes a totally
[1:21:43] different situation where you start the
[1:21:45] things in life then start to take over
[1:21:48] you to where you
[1:21:50] recognize it's it's not my faults that
[1:21:53] I'm living by
[1:21:56] it's not my thoughts that that bring my
[1:21:59] actions to to to life it's the spirit
[1:22:03] that's in me that controls my spirit
[1:22:07] that controls my body that controls my
[1:22:09] flesh that controls my mind amen but
[1:22:13] remember you have control see that's one
[1:22:16] of the one of the greatest deceptions in
[1:22:19] this world today or at least our country
[1:22:21] I know one of the greatest deceptions
[1:22:24] that we we have that brings no
[1:22:26] responsibility to people who do wrong
[1:22:29] there seems to be no repercussions no
[1:22:33] responsibility people always want to
[1:22:35] blame it on something else oh this
[1:22:38] person has this or this person has that
[1:22:40] I don't care what they have I'm sorry
[1:22:44] but they did this and it's wrong yeah
[1:22:47] and they have to pay the price for it I
[1:22:49] remember years and years ago when I was
[1:22:52] probably in my 20s the first time time I
[1:22:54] ever heard about a murder defense a
[1:22:58] person that had murdered somebody and
[1:23:00] their defense was
[1:23:03] Insanity my first thought was well of
[1:23:05] course they're insane they just killed
[1:23:07] somebody right but that doesn't that
[1:23:10] shouldn't let them off the hug right
[1:23:12] that shouldn't give them a that's not a
[1:23:14] get out of jail free card but that's
[1:23:16] what it's become and it seems like and
[1:23:19] that's been 30 40 years ago since then
[1:23:21] it's gotten worse and worse yeah amen
[1:23:25] they excuse this and excuse that and
[1:23:27] well they have a right to do this well
[1:23:29] they have it's okay that they steal this
[1:23:31] much or it's okay that they do this and
[1:23:34] nobody nobody takes
[1:23:36] responsibility yeah no
[1:23:38] responsibility there's been court cases
[1:23:41] in this country that's come up and and
[1:23:43] people say well it's blah blah blob this
[1:23:46] this this this and this I don't care
[1:23:49] about all
[1:23:50] that did they do this this is against
[1:23:53] the law
[1:23:55] they did this and because they broke the
[1:23:58] law they should pay the
[1:24:00] penalty period yeah there is no oh well
[1:24:06] were they raised in a bad home or were
[1:24:09] were they lived in a single parent home
[1:24:11] or were was it this or they sick with
[1:24:14] this or they got addicted on drugs or
[1:24:16] something I don't care I'm sorry I wish
[1:24:20] it weren't I hope they get better but
[1:24:22] that's not the point right the point is
[1:24:25] it's against the law you did it you pay
[1:24:28] the price but see there's no personal
[1:24:31] responsibility
[1:24:33] anymore there's no there's no uh uh
[1:24:37] repercussions anymore but see people are
[1:24:40] free moral agents and have the ability
[1:24:43] to choose what they want to do they make
[1:24:47] their own choices and they operate their
[1:24:50] lives based on their choices most
[1:24:53] people's choices from their mind their
[1:24:56] intellect their knowledge and again that
[1:24:59] will absolutely destroy you every time
[1:25:03] right but a Christian doesn't do that a
[1:25:07] born again Christian receives what their
[1:25:10] free moral agency is and we are still
[1:25:12] free moral Agents from the from the new
[1:25:17] nature uh that that we have the spirit
[1:25:20] of God that now comes and controls the
[1:25:23] spirit that controls the body that we
[1:25:25] allow to control our
[1:25:28] minds we have a choice people act like
[1:25:31] nowaday she don't have a choice oh well
[1:25:33] they're like that they were born that
[1:25:35] way no they weren't right that that that
[1:25:39] that boy was was that girl was born a
[1:25:42] boy but she was always supposed to be a
[1:25:44] girl no she wasn't no he wasn't right
[1:25:48] God doesn't make any mistakes friend I'm
[1:25:50] sorry
[1:25:51] amen that's just the way I feel about it
[1:25:54] God God doesn't make mistakes amen and
[1:25:56] by putting it on God to say they we're
[1:25:59] born that way now I know through hybrid
[1:26:03] foods and all kinds of stuff that
[1:26:04] there's all kind of birth defs and
[1:26:06] things I understand all that and things
[1:26:08] that mess up kids' minds and stuff but
[1:26:11] it but but a person is not that's born a
[1:26:15] boy is a boy not a girl a a person
[1:26:18] that's BN born a girl is a girl not a
[1:26:21] boy and you don't say well they were
[1:26:23] supposed to be this way by whose
[1:26:26] authority right by whose authority was
[1:26:29] this supposed to be a girl who says
[1:26:32] there supposed to be a girl just because
[1:26:34] of some Spirit has gotten on them to
[1:26:36] pervert them to make them feel like no
[1:26:40] accountability yeah amen that's the
[1:26:43] whole thing no accountability but see
[1:26:47] and again from the mind their thoughts
[1:26:50] it's it's what perverts their minds
[1:26:52] again look here the spirit that worketh
[1:26:55] in the children of
[1:26:57] Disobedience disobedient to what the
[1:27:00] word right they're not disobedient maybe
[1:27:03] to the government or to their parents or
[1:27:06] whatever but they're disobedient to the
[1:27:09] word amen and now that there's no
[1:27:12] accountability now that there's no
[1:27:14] repercussion we're
[1:27:16] we this is my opinion we're devolving
[1:27:19] into a third world country that anyway
[1:27:22] but there's no there's no accountability
[1:27:26] is is complete Disobedience to God's
[1:27:31] word the lust of the flesh the pride of
[1:27:34] life the fulfilling of the desires of
[1:27:37] the flesh the desires of the Mind where
[1:27:40] do the desires of the Mind come from
[1:27:42] from what you can see what you can feel
[1:27:45] what you can hear these things every one
[1:27:48] of these things has a
[1:27:50] spirit and those Spirits attached to
[1:27:53] that person's spirit and perverts that
[1:27:56] person's Spirit right right make them
[1:27:59] think they's something they're not right
[1:28:01] make them think they're some perversion
[1:28:03] that's outside of God's word amen yeah
[1:28:07] and when it's outside of God's word then
[1:28:09] it's wrong I'm sorry that's just that's
[1:28:12] that's the way I believe it if it's
[1:28:13] outside of God's word it's
[1:28:16] wrong the
[1:28:18] government science medicine is not the
[1:28:22] ultimate Authority God's word is amen
[1:28:24] and if it goes outside that then there
[1:28:27] is no Authority there Common Sense
[1:28:30] friend has just got to the place that's
[1:28:32] not common anymore we used to call it
[1:28:34] common sense I don't know if we can call
[1:28:36] it sense
[1:28:38] anymore or
[1:28:40] sensible what used to be sensible just
[1:28:42] doesn't seem to be sensible
[1:28:45] anymore it used to be the things that
[1:28:47] you see now and and and how does this
[1:28:50] come
[1:28:52] about through through Disobedience to
[1:28:55] God's word amen through the lustful
[1:28:59] through the through the fulfilling of
[1:29:01] desires of the of the Flesh and of the
[1:29:05] Mind amen these As We Know divined by
[1:29:09] the scripture are the children of
[1:29:11] Wrath amen I just thank God that at one
[1:29:15] time I was dead in my
[1:29:18] sin as most of the world
[1:29:21] is now I'm dead to sin amen amen sin has
[1:29:26] no hold on me anymore yes sin has no
[1:29:29] authority over me on anymore sin has
[1:29:32] nothing to hold me anymore amen when God
[1:29:35] loosed me and set me free and filled me
[1:29:37] with his Spirit it Loose Sin from you it
[1:29:41] Loose Sin from us and has no no grip No
[1:29:45] Authority anymore there was a time where
[1:29:48] Satan could lay claim and say I'm taken
[1:29:52] them with me because now it's gone he
[1:29:55] cannot do that anymore because it's
[1:29:57] loosed its grip he cannot go before God
[1:30:01] who is the author of life and say I'm
[1:30:03] going to take them because God says
[1:30:06] no that has no authority over this
[1:30:09] person amen amen by the blood of Christ
[1:30:13] it's been released they have no nothing
[1:30:17] else to do with sin sin has no more grip
[1:30:20] over you if sin has no more grip over
[1:30:23] you then Satan has no more grip over you
[1:30:27] amen praise the Lord let's go over
[1:30:30] another couple chapters chapter 4 second
[1:30:32] uh seal in
[1:30:40] Ephesians amen Ephesians chapter
[1:30:43] 4 you know we
[1:30:45] criticize often probably I know I do I
[1:30:49] probably more than I should but you
[1:30:52] criticize people for the things they do
[1:30:55] the way they look the way they dress the
[1:30:57] way they act the things they do I I
[1:31:00] probably more critical than I should
[1:31:01] because the understanding truly is that
[1:31:04] they're just acting out living out who
[1:31:06] they are amen I
[1:31:10] mean I I could go to the cactus right
[1:31:14] here across the street and yell at and
[1:31:15] scream at all I want that it should be a
[1:31:17] rose
[1:31:18] bush but that Cactus is never going to
[1:31:21] be a rose bush right amen and I'm I'm
[1:31:24] not saying some of these people uh don't
[1:31:26] have the opportunity or ability to be a
[1:31:28] child of God I'm not saying that right
[1:31:30] but I'm just saying they're acting it's
[1:31:32] growing and acting and living a cactus
[1:31:34] life because that's what it is amen so I
[1:31:38] understand that but we we must
[1:31:40] understand that even though we can be
[1:31:43] critical of people's actions you started
[1:31:46] the first it had to first start in their
[1:31:48] mind right amen it had to come to the
[1:31:51] Gateway first before it ever became an
[1:31:54] action it became a thought amen the
[1:31:58] first thing it could be is a thought
[1:31:59] then it can become an action amen and
[1:32:02] people and then that's where uh these
[1:32:04] things come in life people act them out
[1:32:06] before we go to uh Ephesians 4 let me
[1:32:08] read
[1:32:10] this look in going beyond the camp
[1:32:17] 1964 brother Ram says and when a man can
[1:32:19] smoke
[1:32:20] cigarettes and doctors proving to him
[1:32:24] that thousands die every year from the
[1:32:27] cause and can still puff away at
[1:32:30] cigarettes it seems like there's
[1:32:31] something wrong with that man's
[1:32:34] mind you would think that's true what
[1:32:37] are they doing they're fulfilling the
[1:32:40] lust of their mind of their flesh and it
[1:32:44] becomes an addiction I understand that
[1:32:47] just like drugs and Things become an
[1:32:49] addiction even uh over-the-counter drugs
[1:32:52] even prescription drugs can become an
[1:32:54] addiction I understand that some have
[1:32:56] more addicted properties than others
[1:32:58] alcohol and cigarettes and things they
[1:33:00] become addicted I understand that but
[1:33:02] that does not relieve a person of their
[1:33:04] personal responsibility right right amen
[1:33:07] there's been people say Well they're an
[1:33:10] addict I don't care I'm sorry hope you
[1:33:13] get better but I don't care because the
[1:33:16] bottom line is you have a choice there's
[1:33:19] been thousands tens of thousands
[1:33:21] hundreds of thousands of peoples who we
[1:33:24] addicts and are not anymore you have a
[1:33:27] choice there's thousands of people
[1:33:30] hundreds millions of people that used to
[1:33:32] be drunks they're not anymore they're
[1:33:34] not alcoholics why because they made a
[1:33:36] choice amen it was their decision to not
[1:33:39] be this way anymore yeah and his brother
[1:33:42] V was saying this person smoking away
[1:33:45] puffing his cigarettes when doctors can
[1:33:47] prove that it's killing thousands of
[1:33:49] people now hundreds of thousands
[1:33:51] probably every year now of course I
[1:33:53] don't know
[1:33:54] I I see less people smoking anymore than
[1:33:56] used to but I do work on a a
[1:33:59] construction site every other week so I
[1:34:01] probably see my more than my fair share
[1:34:03] of smokers but anyway it just makes you
[1:34:06] realize or wonder what is what is Gras a
[1:34:09] hold of that person's mind to think that
[1:34:11] well I'm going to be the person that
[1:34:12] doesn't die from this I'm going to be
[1:34:15] the person that doesn't end up with
[1:34:16] cellophane skin I'm going to be the
[1:34:18] person that doesn't have blood clots I'm
[1:34:20] going to be the person that doesn't lose
[1:34:21] limbs and have stuff uh uh surgery to
[1:34:24] have my tongue removed or my jaw removed
[1:34:27] or I'm going to be the person that's
[1:34:29] going to be perfectly fine because of
[1:34:32] smoking cigarettes my whole
[1:34:34] life doesn't work that way amen amen
[1:34:38] doesn't work that way and brother BR
[1:34:40] says there must be something wrong with
[1:34:42] that man's mind and you would have to
[1:34:45] think that there has to be some mental
[1:34:48] capacity in that person to to say
[1:34:51] something's wrong there amen but he goes
[1:34:54] on and says this now and when a
[1:34:56] man has a mental
[1:34:59] shock uh doesn't get himself together
[1:35:03] what he's doing he'll search every
[1:35:05] doctor's office there is in the country
[1:35:07] to find out what's going wrong with him
[1:35:10] but then he'll stand at the door of a
[1:35:12] bar or in the car and drink until he is
[1:35:16] totally
[1:35:18] insane spend his money shove himself
[1:35:22] into that and and if he happen to get
[1:35:24] into it without the intoxication of
[1:35:26] liquor then he'll spend every penny he
[1:35:29] finds in the doctor's office trying to
[1:35:31] figure out what is wrong with him
[1:35:34] brother says it doesn't make any
[1:35:37] sense and it doesn't to a regular normal
[1:35:40] thinking mind it doesn't make any
[1:35:43] sense yeah it it's like people it's like
[1:35:48] someone putting their hand on a table
[1:35:50] and taking a ballpen hammer and smashing
[1:35:53] their first
[1:35:54] digit and say and going to the doctor
[1:35:56] and saying what happened to my finger
[1:35:59] Doc it's broken pieces what happened and
[1:36:03] trying to figure out a cause when he's
[1:36:06] the one that laid the hammer to
[1:36:08] it and try to go figure out medically
[1:36:11] what's
[1:36:13] wrong sister f was some about getting
[1:36:16] old I've never Ed the word diet and and
[1:36:19] myself in the same sentence ever in my
[1:36:21] life and you could probably look at me
[1:36:23] tell why but I'm on a as you'd say diet
[1:36:27] now amen because I'm trying to be more
[1:36:31] careful about certain things that I
[1:36:34] intake ingest it's not something that
[1:36:37] I'm just cold jkey but I just more
[1:36:40] careful amen of things and and the
[1:36:43] results are the results speak for
[1:36:46] themselves amen I'm not bragging my wife
[1:36:50] says don't brag not bragging but I've
[1:36:53] lost 10 10 pound since I started doing
[1:36:54] this well praise the Lord I'm like I'm
[1:36:57] just shocked not bragging I'm just
[1:36:59] shocked I I I just I wouldn't have
[1:37:02] believed that would be possible in like
[1:37:05] two weeks
[1:37:07] how I'm like if time keeps going I'm
[1:37:10] going to
[1:37:11] disappear at this
[1:37:13] rate two pounds already and and my feet
[1:37:17] feel better so praise the
[1:37:21] Lorden uh now if
[1:37:24] if I keep doing what I was doing and my
[1:37:27] feet kept getting worse and I'd go back
[1:37:29] to the doctor and say Doc I just don't
[1:37:32] understand what's wrong with my feet he
[1:37:33] said well did you do what I told you I
[1:37:35] said
[1:37:36] well a little
[1:37:39] bit did you do what I told you did you
[1:37:42] read the prescription did you follow the
[1:37:45] prescription
[1:37:47] amen well not really well that's what's
[1:37:49] wrong with
[1:37:51] you if you want it to be better you got
[1:37:53] to you and we're all free more agents we
[1:37:57] all have the ability in our minds where
[1:37:59] is our free more agcy we have free more
[1:38:01] agcy and mind we decide remember we
[1:38:03] started with this the very first service
[1:38:06] we decide and even in a split
[1:38:09] second in the mind we can either accept
[1:38:12] it or reject it yeah amen and I am very
[1:38:16] happy and proud to say national donut
[1:38:18] dut day was Friday and I did not have a
[1:38:22] donut yeah felt good about myself praise
[1:38:25] the Lord I didn't ask Sonia to stop
[1:38:26] getting one or
[1:38:28] anything I was able to ref but it's not
[1:38:31] a big deal to me so when I was a kid
[1:38:34] like if I was Joel and Emma's age no
[1:38:35] that'd be a different story but nowadays
[1:38:37] it's it's not that big a deal anymore uh
[1:38:41] I I just you I don't when I was when I
[1:38:44] was Troll's age I my dad would take me
[1:38:46] to the store and I thought man if I
[1:38:47] could just if I just had a cart I'd take
[1:38:50] the candy a and just rake it off and I
[1:38:52] would eat it all before
[1:38:55] midnight when I went trick-or-treating I
[1:38:58] took a I took a a pillowcase sack I
[1:39:01] didn't take a little Jack Lantern thing
[1:39:03] or a little I took a
[1:39:06] pillowcase I was expecting to be filled
[1:39:09] up uh because that's just but now it's
[1:39:12] just not it's not that big a deal
[1:39:14] anymore but see what is it done I could
[1:39:17] still do that but in in in our
[1:39:19] minds uh is the acceptance or rejecting
[1:39:23] I are we going to accept it or are we
[1:39:24] going to reject it amen a lot of people
[1:39:27] accept it becomes part of their life
[1:39:29] smoke away drink away you get a result
[1:39:32] go to the doctor why doctor well are you
[1:39:35] doing
[1:39:38] this you got to choose amen got to
[1:39:41] choose then that's when brother brand
[1:39:44] comes up and says it doesn't make any
[1:39:46] sense why am I like
[1:39:50] this pretty obvious but the problem is a
[1:39:54] lot of people don't want to know the
[1:39:55] truth yeah a lot of times you tell
[1:39:57] people the truth and they don't they
[1:39:58] don't want to hear that they don't want
[1:40:00] to know they don't want to hear the
[1:40:02] truth amen because the truth is
[1:40:04] sometimes hard sometimes greats against
[1:40:06] the Flesh and it's difficult on the
[1:40:08] flesh it takes away something that you
[1:40:10] want to do that you desire to do you
[1:40:12] enjoy to do or eat or whatever it takes
[1:40:15] those things away and people don't want
[1:40:16] to know the truth yeah
[1:40:18] amen just that's just nature now had you
[1:40:22] turn to Ephesians 4 let's go through
[1:40:24] this real here not real quick but let's
[1:40:26] look at
[1:40:27] this Ephesians
[1:40:29] 4:17 start with verse
[1:40:36] 17 this I say therefore and testify in
[1:40:39] the Lord that he henceforth walk not as
[1:40:43] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:40:46] their minds so see it's a walk notice
[1:40:50] flesh walk
[1:40:53] in their minds the vanity of their minds
[1:40:55] the vanity is devoid of learning devoid
[1:40:58] of knowing uh devoid of godliness even
[1:41:01] uh if you go look at that definition uh
[1:41:04] vanity of their mind it doesn't
[1:41:07] necessarily mean that they're vain to
[1:41:09] per se uh but it just means devoid of
[1:41:12] that understanding or devoid of that
[1:41:15] principle of
[1:41:17] God they walk in the vanity of their
[1:41:19] mind having the
[1:41:21] understanding remember that
[1:41:24] understanding is is in the mind the
[1:41:27] understanding having their understanding
[1:41:30] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:41:33] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:41:36] them the ignorance what is ignorance
[1:41:39] ignorance isn't stupid ignorance isn't
[1:41:42] Dumb ignorance is not
[1:41:44] knowing amen ignorance is someone who
[1:41:47] doesn't
[1:41:48] know so the life of alienated from the
[1:41:52] life of of God through ignorance but
[1:41:54] look at their ignorance now why are they
[1:41:57] ignorant there's a reason why they're
[1:41:59] it's not just not knowing there's a
[1:42:01] reason why they don't know listen that
[1:42:03] is in them because of the blindness of
[1:42:07] their hearts or blindness is hardened
[1:42:11] their hearts have been hardened they
[1:42:14] don't want to hear about God they don't
[1:42:15] want to know about God is anybody ever
[1:42:17] met anybody like that you come and you
[1:42:20] try to present God to them and they just
[1:42:21] shut you down you know heartbeat because
[1:42:23] they don't want to know they don't want
[1:42:25] to hear it their their hearts are
[1:42:29] blackened their hearts are numb their
[1:42:32] hearts are seared remember uh I forget
[1:42:36] what scripture it is when it talks about
[1:42:37] their conscience being seared with a hot
[1:42:41] iron that means it's numb it's devoid of
[1:42:44] feeling it's it's uh it's
[1:42:48] black there's a numbness there because
[1:42:50] they don't want to know they they had
[1:42:53] the chance to know they had the
[1:42:55] opportunity to know they had the choice
[1:42:57] here we go back with the choice again
[1:43:00] they had the choice to know but they
[1:43:03] rejected amen their heart has been
[1:43:07] blinded blinded cut off hardened
[1:43:12] hardened against God now sometimes
[1:43:14] people get hardened against God because
[1:43:16] they've had a bad experience they blame
[1:43:19] God for something or they blame God for
[1:43:21] an an EV vent in their life or something
[1:43:24] and they shut God off they blame God and
[1:43:27] they think that's God's fault amen it's
[1:43:30] like going 80 miles an hour down the
[1:43:32] interstate and turning into a bridge
[1:43:34] embunkment and saying God why did you
[1:43:36] have me
[1:43:38] crash well I didn't you had the car you
[1:43:41] had the control of the pedal how fast
[1:43:43] you were going in the steering wheel you
[1:43:46] crashed not me I didn't crash you but
[1:43:48] people blame stuff like that on God I
[1:43:50] know that's a that's probably a
[1:43:52] ridiculous analogy but uh but that's
[1:43:56] similar to what a lot of people think
[1:43:59] why did God do this God didn't do it you
[1:44:01] did it they did it their choices did it
[1:44:04] amen but people will become hardened
[1:44:07] because of things like that their heart
[1:44:09] will become blackened hardened now
[1:44:12] they're ignorance yes but they're
[1:44:13] willingly ignorant remember the
[1:44:15] scripture that says they're willingly
[1:44:17] ignorant they don't want to know
[1:44:20] amen uh but it's but but it it is a walk
[1:44:23] it is an action amen the action that we
[1:44:27] the action that we perform every day is
[1:44:30] a result of what goes through our minds
[1:44:33] amen the action that anybody performs
[1:44:36] every day is a result of what goes
[1:44:38] through their minds amen 19th verse who
[1:44:42] being past
[1:44:43] feeling have given themselves over unto
[1:44:46] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:44:50] with greediness they want to do it
[1:44:52] that's just it they enjoy the lust they
[1:44:55] enjoy the Fulfillment of the lust so it
[1:44:58] doesn't mean anything the other doesn't
[1:45:00] mean anything to them because they're
[1:45:03] fil they're fulfilling the desires of
[1:45:05] their of their mind of the Flesh of
[1:45:07] their desires lasciviousness uncleanness
[1:45:11] greediness but ye have not so learned
[1:45:15] Christ if so be that ye have heard him
[1:45:19] and have been taught by him as the truth
[1:45:22] is in Jesus now where are you taught
[1:45:24] again over and over it it reiterates to
[1:45:27] us the point that the scripture I
[1:45:30] believe and Paul to the Ephesians is
[1:45:32] trying to get AC cross in your
[1:45:34] mind we are taught in our minds even we
[1:45:37] as Born Again Christians when we read
[1:45:40] the scripture when we heard it priests
[1:45:42] when we listen to it or when we feed on
[1:45:44] it it comes into our minds we are taught
[1:45:48] it but there's a thing in a bornan
[1:45:50] believer that takes them Beyond just
[1:45:53] knowing it in their mind and that is
[1:45:55] your soul is Born Again by the spirit of
[1:45:57] God and he brings a revelation of that
[1:46:00] word where it becomes real then it's not
[1:46:03] just a thought right it's something that
[1:46:06] becomes a part of you it is now who you
[1:46:09] are not just what you think or even what
[1:46:13] you do it's who you are now of course
[1:46:15] you're going to do what you are but it's
[1:46:18] it's a part of you now revelation God
[1:46:21] bringing himself and
[1:46:23] showing if someone can convince you of
[1:46:27] something and it's just a part of what
[1:46:30] you think a next person can come through
[1:46:32] with a better argument about the
[1:46:34] situation and talk you right out of what
[1:46:36] you just thought you were going to
[1:46:37] believe forever right amen if they come
[1:46:41] through with a better argument they can
[1:46:43] change what's in your mind because
[1:46:44] remember even in the Garden of Eden
[1:46:46] remember notice this is the one of the
[1:46:48] greatest we said this in the beginning
[1:46:51] greatest tools that say
[1:46:53] has is to is is to bring this in life
[1:46:57] that's what happened in the Garden of
[1:46:59] Eden she had the knowledge of God
[1:47:01] through what her husband had told her
[1:47:04] amen God told Adam the day you eat
[1:47:07] thereof the day you die he tells his
[1:47:09] wife now I know that's not in the
[1:47:10] scripture but there's no place that we
[1:47:13] find where God told her
[1:47:15] that so where would she have learned it
[1:47:17] from her husband her head which is where
[1:47:20] she should have learned it because she's
[1:47:22] a part of
[1:47:23] she is woe
[1:47:27] man correct so she had that knowledge
[1:47:32] well she believed
[1:47:35] it I believe she believed it absolutely
[1:47:38] so much so that when she came into the
[1:47:40] discussion with the serpent she repeated
[1:47:42] it to the serpent because that's what
[1:47:44] she believed but she only believed it
[1:47:47] here she only believed it as an
[1:47:48] intellectual conception so when he came
[1:47:51] through and his AR argument was oh well
[1:47:54] yeah that's true that is right but God
[1:47:56] does know but also in addition to no
[1:48:00] words no additions it was and is exactly
[1:48:05] the way God said it amen always period
[1:48:09] but he comes and says but in
[1:48:12] addition God does know that when you do
[1:48:15] this you're going to become as God's
[1:48:17] knowing good and evil and so on so for
[1:48:19] and he was right absolutely truth that's
[1:48:21] exactly what happened
[1:48:23] but it was against God's word but it was
[1:48:26] the same tactics the devil used then he
[1:48:29] uses the same tactics now he's trying he
[1:48:32] tries to do the exact same thing to us
[1:48:35] now to G to bring a bigger AR greater
[1:48:38] argument that's why
[1:48:41] that when you become born again it it
[1:48:44] that something that is of God must
[1:48:46] become a revelation to you must become a
[1:48:49] part of you that way I don't care who
[1:48:51] comes through with what kind of argument
[1:48:53] against or about you know what the truth

[1:49:17] prophet then why waste my time listening

[1:49:48] part of me amen and there's no argument
[1:49:52] Satan can try to bring through anybody
[1:49:54] that's going to convince me any
[1:49:55] differently praise the
[1:49:58] Lord been taught look again been taught
[1:50:03] by him as the truth in Jesus 22nd verse
[1:50:06] that ye put off concerning the former
[1:50:10] conversation the old man putting off the
[1:50:13] old man which is corrupt according to
[1:50:17] the deceitful lust now we talk about
[1:50:20] putting off an old man of our nature but
[1:50:23] what about this old man that I am I
[1:50:27] learned a lot of things when I was a
[1:50:29] sinner amen I learned a lot of wrong
[1:50:32] things when I was a sinner I learned a
[1:50:33] lot of things that were against God when
[1:50:35] I was a sinner that old man's got to go
[1:50:39] amen amen I can't take all the other
[1:50:42] things that I've learned out of a
[1:50:43] denomination and try to merge them in
[1:50:44] with the message it doesn't work amen
[1:50:47] amen praise the Lord that old man's got
[1:50:50] to
[1:50:51] die which is corrupt according to the
[1:50:54] deceitful lust be renewed and be renewed

[1:51:01] same word it talks about in um uh let
[1:51:06] this mind be in you which is in Christ
[1:51:08] Jesus also
[1:51:11] um u in Romans where it talks about
[1:51:16] the I'm trying to remember the exact
[1:51:18] scripture how it's how it's quoted or
[1:51:20] how it's read
[1:51:23] about re about not being conformed to
[1:51:25] the world but being transformed the
[1:51:28] transformation is the renewing amen it's
[1:51:31] the same uh it's the same root word here
[1:51:34] when it talks about being renewed in the
[1:51:36] spirit of REM mind it's talking about
[1:51:37] being transformed not conform not
[1:51:41] changing not making yourself a different
[1:51:43] person but letting God come and
[1:51:45] transform you amen so that you become a
[1:51:49] new creature for 24th verse and that you
[1:51:52] put on the new man which is after God in
[1:51:56] created is created in righteousness and
[1:51:59] true Holiness wherefore wherefore
[1:52:03] putting away lying speak every man truth

[1:52:46] kind of place at all amen it's a thought
[1:52:50] that shouldn't be spoken and cast it
[1:52:52] down bring it captive don't speak it the
[1:52:56] devil can use that that's a wedge
[1:52:59] Amen Let give no PL never don't give a
[1:53:02] place to the devil let him that stole
[1:53:05] steal no more but rather let him labor
[1:53:08] working with his hands the thing which
[1:53:11] is good that he may have to give to him
[1:53:14] that needeth let no corrupt
[1:53:16] communication proceed out of your mouth

[1:54:31] and this world needs it more than ever
[1:54:35] amen of course there will be no peace
[1:54:38] until he comes yes
[1:54:41] but let me read this quote in in the in
[1:54:45] the message Fellowship
[1:54:49] 1962 he talks about the Waters of
[1:54:51] separation
[1:54:54] separating us the Waters of Separation
[1:54:56] letting us recognize that we are sinners
[1:54:59] that we're trespassers that's the reason
[1:55:02] I could Hammer the thing sin of course
[1:55:05] he's talking about that's the reason any
[1:55:07] Minister ought to stand against anything
[1:55:10] that God said is wrong to
[1:55:12] do if he's Spirit-filled he will for it
[1:55:17] comes from Heaven against the wrong and
[1:55:20] we mustn't do that that that's the
[1:55:22] Waters of Separation still that wasn't
[1:55:25] enough look now that wasn't enough he
[1:55:28] understood now brother brand was talking
[1:55:31] about physical uh understanding the
[1:55:36] mind he understood that was his
[1:55:39] knowledge his mind the womb of his mind
[1:55:42] the Battlegrounds where the battle is
[1:55:44] fought in the mind then he cast it aside
[1:55:48] he accept that is God's provided way
[1:55:51] Amen in his mind in his
[1:55:54] knowledge notice now he said that's
[1:55:56] where he
[1:55:58] accepted is he ready for Fellowship now
[1:56:01] brother R says no
[1:56:03] no that was Lucifer's message just get
[1:56:07] it up here and you're okay just believe
[1:56:09] you're just believe you're okay believe
[1:56:11] you're born again just believe that you
[1:56:12] have accepted just amen and people even
[1:56:15] confess
[1:56:17] it amen amen I I I had one of my best
[1:56:21] friends
[1:56:23] um he he was a good man he followed um a
[1:56:28] Ministry that
[1:56:29] was uh I'd say off the word I heard the
[1:56:34] Minister preach very popular very well
[1:56:36] known on the tell evangelists and stuff
[1:56:40] like
[1:56:41] that uh and I had a little contention
[1:56:47] with him one time we discussed the
[1:56:49] scripture many times most of the time we
[1:56:51] uh we were very U cordial about it but
[1:56:55] one time we had little contention about
[1:56:57] scripture and he was trying to tell me
[1:57:00] he went to talk to this woman that was a
[1:57:02] sales consultant at the at our company
[1:57:05] and uh how to become Born Again of
[1:57:08] course he believed that speaking in
[1:57:10] evidence speaking in tongues was initial
[1:57:12] evidence of the Holy Ghost so he just
[1:57:14] said read the scripture confess with
[1:57:17] your mouth believe confess with your
[1:57:19] mouth and speak in tongues and that's it
[1:57:21] you're say
[1:57:23] you're you're born again that that's
[1:57:26] that's it so he got her to confess with
[1:57:28] her mouth said yeah I believe God and
[1:57:31] then he got her to jabber which he told
[1:57:33] me how they do it I don't know how they
[1:57:34] blah blah blah blah blah whatever they
[1:57:36] do and and she started jabbering he says
[1:57:38] she he says stop you've got
[1:57:40] it and and I I How Could You deceive her
[1:57:44] like that right yeah that I I know and
[1:57:47] see he took not the jabbering part with
[1:57:50] the tongues but he took the
[1:57:53] a part of the scripture that that you
[1:57:55] confess with your mouth that is
[1:57:56] scripture I understand that amen but
[1:57:59] this is the point brother brandom is
[1:58:01] trying to get to here that's good now
[1:58:04] look he said he said that was Luther's
[1:58:07] message uh and and that and that means
[1:58:10] that he's headed in the right direction
[1:58:12] now amen but that's not all there is
[1:58:17] it's not all just thinking well it's
[1:58:20] it's okay I believe I I've accepted I
[1:58:23] confessed I I want Jesus as my savior
[1:58:26] well that's fine that's a nice in that's
[1:58:28] a nice
[1:58:29] intellectual uh uh
[1:58:32] Christianity but what about a born again
[1:58:34] experience amen there's more than just
[1:58:37] saying why I believe that that he is uh
[1:58:40] that he's God I believe I accept him as
[1:58:42] my personal savior that was all the
[1:58:44] that's what we were taught in the
[1:58:45] Baptist Church you know just you accept
[1:58:47] Jesus as your personal savior then you
[1:58:49] know when you get baptized and that's
[1:58:51] you
[1:58:52] you you've made it and we know that's
[1:58:55] not true there's more to the scripture
[1:58:58] there's more to the story The just an
[1:59:01] intellectually he said now if you've
[1:59:03] received it you've got it you believe it
[1:59:04] you spoke it uh you're on the way that's
[1:59:08] good but so many people stop there they
[1:59:11] they they end their experience with that
[1:59:15] and then all it becomes as an
[1:59:16] intellectual experience and not a born
[1:59:18] again experience when we don't have the
[1:59:20] Born Again experience you don't have God
[1:59:23] Amen you've got an intellectual
[1:59:24] conception of it you can go to any
[1:59:26] church in the world you go to any
[1:59:28] Seminary or something you can learn an
[1:59:31] intellectual conception but it takes a
[1:59:34] new birth that kills the old man that
[1:59:37] makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:59:39] it takes a new birth it takes the Holy
[1:59:42] Spirit coming and taking control over
[1:59:44] your life amen making you a new
[1:59:48] person amen I got one more scripture and
[1:59:51] I'm going to close here
[1:59:53] here in Romans uh Romans chapter
[2:00:03] 1 Romans chapter 1 read one verse verse
[2:00:08] 28 I'll close here Romans 1:
[2:00:15] 128 and even as they did not like to
[2:00:18] retain God in their knowledge even as
[2:00:21] they listen L how this is worded they
[2:00:23] even as they did not like to retain God
[2:00:27] in their
[2:00:28] knowledge God gave them over now this
[2:00:31] kind of goes with the last scripture
[2:00:32] that was talking about the the the
[2:00:35] ignorance the willfully ignorance the
[2:00:38] will the ignorance based on the blinded
[2:00:41] heart the hardened
[2:00:43] heart did not like to retain God in
[2:00:46] their knowledge and I don't want to hear
[2:00:47] about God don't talk to me about God I
[2:00:49] don't want to know anything about him
[2:00:51] amen
[2:00:53] okay then that's what you'll
[2:00:55] have did not like to retain God in their
[2:00:59] knowledge God gave them over to a
[2:01:02] reprobate mind now that is why someone
[2:01:08] would think that they were a girl when
[2:01:10] they were born a boy
[2:01:13] right amen and so many other things
[2:01:17] along those lines we go into but right
[2:01:20] there it is
[2:01:22] they did not like to retain God in a
[2:01:24] knowledge this country rejected God Amen
[2:01:28] we know
[2:01:29] that God gave them over to reprobate
[2:01:32] mind and now it's a common thing now
[2:01:36] it's common it's thought to be normal if
[2:01:39] you will it's
[2:01:41] okay
[2:01:43] accepted when it's filthiness in by the
[2:01:46] scriptures definition it's it's
[2:01:49] filthiness in God's mind if it's
[2:01:52] filthiness in God's mind it's filthiness
[2:01:53] in mine sorry I love the person I want
[2:01:57] to see him saved and go to heaven but
[2:01:59] their actions and what they're doing is
[2:02:01] filthiness of God's mind and but the
[2:02:03] point is they don't want to know God
[2:02:06] right they don't want to hear about God
[2:02:09] if someone I I I'll say this With all
[2:02:12] sincerity from my heart if someone were
[2:02:15] to try to come and run for
[2:02:18] president that took a Godly attitude a
[2:02:21] scriptural Christian attitude and
[2:02:24] espouse those values in their uh
[2:02:31] speeches
[2:02:33] and all the ungodly things of the
[2:02:36] country and and espouse the true
[2:02:38] Christian Godly value you think that
[2:02:40] person probably won't even get but aund
[2:02:43] votes that person wouldn't be
[2:02:46] elected
[2:02:47] amen absolutely not why they don't want
[2:02:52] to
[2:02:53] know they don't like to retain the
[2:02:56] things of God in their knowledge I'll
[2:02:58] just I'll believe God with my mind of
[2:03:00] who I think he is God gave them over to
[2:03:02] reprobate mind to do those things which
[2:03:04] are not
[2:03:05] convenient amen when they've been given
[2:03:08] over to a reprobate mind then anything's
[2:03:11] okay yes doesn't matter anymore there
[2:03:13] are no standards there are no morals
[2:03:15] there are there is there literally is no
[2:03:18] right and
[2:03:19] wrong they do whatever they want yeah
[2:03:22] amen where is it they don't want to
[2:03:25] receive
[2:03:27] it they reject it reject God is to
[2:03:33] receive well you know what's not God the
[2:03:37] devil you receive everything that's evil
[2:03:41] wretched amen amen and that's the sad
[2:03:44] part about
[2:03:49] it all over
[2:03:52] but God has a people amen God has a
[2:03:56] people that's been called out that
[2:03:58] believe and stand upon his word amen
[2:04:01] praise God and they guard themselves

[2:04:35] little thing goes wrong she doesn't
[2:04:38] leave God because things don't work out
[2:04:39] the way she thought they were going to
[2:04:41] she doesn't leave God because it comes
[2:04:44] against what they thought or what they
[2:04:46] felt or how they believed it was going
[2:04:48] to
[2:04:49] be she trusts God yes
[2:04:52] she has faith in
[2:04:54] God and her faith in God outweighs
[2:04:57] everything else yes amen whether it's
[2:05:00] good to her him the person bad doesn't
[2:05:04] matter amen she holds it true because
