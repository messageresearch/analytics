pray for Ronnie if we will amen so which which ey has gone bad left eye and the right eye is getting P amen so sure absolutely both of them amen let's pray for brother Ron good amen also got a couple of updates um from Sister Karen uh good morning dear Saints I'm in sholo now recuperating from surgeries uh still having trouble getting around walking the Lord for complete healing praying for each of you so continue remember Sister Karen in prayer obviously want to remember her amen obviously if I had the choice to be in sholo this week I would have to and I think it was 108 in sholo my Tuesday is October 1st I know it happens every year but I just can't get over it every year it gets to October and it's still 100 and I'm thinking why praise the Lord um sister Lydia also sent us a report says good morning greetings to you all just wanted to update you on my progress I saw the nurse practitioner on Tuesday she said all of my labs have been good I have four more infusion treatments left last one is the first week of November thank you Lord God bless you all for praying uh one more t uh CT scan in November God is good we will be worshiping with you all soon amen that we are very much looking forward to praise the Lord for sister Lydia amen and sister car Lord will sister sheilia who did come in that praise the Lord amen m is a prise yes I noticed that um yes well then we we'll we'll hold on to the praise report amen from Sister sheilia praise the Lord amen also uh almost failed to mention uh got a text from sister mati she was on her way to church had a flat tire on her uh bicycle so uh she's not going to be able to make it uh she said she could have caught the bus got here by 11 uh but she's kind of stressed out now and um her feeling stress is feeling a tightness in her chest so we just I told her that of course we'd be praying for her uh that the Lord would just touch her and and he and help her heal that situation and uh and her bicycle so so praise the Lord that's the request I have anyone else have anything in your heart today Lord knows all of our needs unspoken request amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet if we could amen ask brother Dennis if you would take Lord Jesus you come before you father thankfulness of heart we're once again gathered together and like Precious Faith dwelling together in unity of your spirit it's like the prophet said is unlimited what God could can do we dwell together in unity Lord I can recall h a time that I just read in in your word that there was a centurion that had a servant that was very sick he ran to you and says uh Jesus come and heal my my sick servant yes and and Lord you said to him that okay I'll come shortly but he mentioned with a man of faith that you don't have to come to my house I'm not worthy that you should walk into the doors of my home but just speak the word and I know my servant will be healed amen and you mentioned such great faith I have not found in Israel and Lord that's what it takes for us as Believers yes Lord for us to stand on your word you claim you paid for our healing already at Calvary and we claim our possession of of healing of financial troubles of uh mental problems and distress whatever we have need of we claim you don't have to do something special you don't have to uh uh per perform a miracle we just want to believe father that we will be healed and our needs will be met according to your riches and Glory yes Jesus and we know father I won't say you can work a miracle but too many times many Believers are are expecting one but maybe it'll take a a little time but it's time to hold hold on to your unchanging hand Lord Hold On To You by faith knowing without faith it's impossible to please God yes Lord and father it's time to truly search our hearts where do we stand with you Lord if there's any unbelief anything in our lives that is doubting or or trying to uh figure out your word differently than what it says take it out of us father Grant it dear God oh Lord there many that are sick even amongst us this morning our sister Norma's husband Ron did needs a healing touch with his eyes father amen We believe We just speak the word in the name of Jesus Christ that his eyesight will be restored and Lord our our sister uh Lydia who's been going through a lot and she gave a good report that she's standing on your promises standing on your word and she can't wait to fellowship with us as believer Lord give her a strong and complete healing father and sister Karen up in the White Mountains Lord touch our precious sister Lord Lord oh May the testimonies come forth you're truly the same yesterday today and forever amen your word has not changed we have changed if we don't hold fast to what is good which is your word and Lord It's a time where uh doubts are stronger than ever before it's time Lord that you take away all unbelief and give us that spiritual eyesight don't let our eyesight grow dim with the uh with your word and and our eyesight whiten that clear with the world it needs to be the opposite that the world dies out and that your Holy Spirit your word becomes greater and becomes more life in US yes Jesus Lord each and every other request I can't remember them all they were spoken you heard them you're aware of them we believe complete and total healing and deliverance whatever they have need of touches every heart with their unspoken requests meet their needs father you know what they are going through you know what they have need of Lord just grant their heart's desire oh it's time to move forward father as our Pastor said signs are around us we as Believers can only truly read those signs of the world they're looking for a Rapture where cars would crash and planes would crash and people would be lifted up and clothes would be on the ground that's not way it's going to happen yes oh you have given us the eyesight you have given us the opportunity the ability by your grace to see the revealed word of what's going to happen and what it takes to uh be ready for a Rapture gr Lord in your name we pray in name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you can be seated if you'd

that we're living Lord God in here what you'd have us to see and know thank you Lord for the message thank you for the truth thank you for a prophet of God that would come to bring a word to a people that would dress her and get her ready for Rapture amen Lord we want to take that word we want to take that message and clothe ourselves in it Lord and take that and help to realize that you spoke through a man in this hour God to a through a prophet Lord to bring to us what we have need for this last days Lord may we not fail to take and and and ingest every word to become every word to let that word sink in and soak in and we become what it is to realize and recognize there's nothing that's taking this bride by surprise yes Lord there's nothing we know God what you do we know who you

Lord we just give thanks Lord for those that are here Lord for those who may be watching God we know that you're more than able to bless us once again in this service speak through these lips the words youd have us to hear bless each ear to hear including mine all of us Lord in every way God to receive from you what you have for us let it not return void we know it cannot accomplish it that now God whatever this purpose whatever the purpose this service Lord this is not a coincidence we didn't come just because it's Sunday morning we come because there's a purpose there's a purpose here today for this service for each of us to be here for each one to be watching Lord for whoever may watch it even archived God there's a purpose let it accomplish let you accomplish what that purpose is now through us as we committed all to your hands ask your blessings upon it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen numbers 24 8 and N amen God brought him forth out of Egypt God the scripture talking about Israel now this is balum going through this situation with Israel this is God speaking of is Israel God brought him forth out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn he shall eat up the Nations his enemies and shall break their bones and Pierce them through with uh with his arrows he couched he laid down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed listen now blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee you could be seated if you'd like amen this very poignant scripture many times we look to we've read we've heard brother brother Brown refer to many many times and it becomes something of a uh of a cry for me uh even even more so in this day I've U uh it's become apparent that it's very possible uh that this that well first of all we read this scripture the scripture is very uh uh uh correct it's it's very up todate uh it's it we we know it to be very true that the the the scripture is plain to say that whoever curses Israel is cursed right and whoever blesses Israel is blessed that prophecy we know came through balam that God gave to balum was the only thing he could do was prophesy uh Bam's way turned into Israel's m akake but we'll get to that in a little bit but I wanted to talk more right now about that situation and we recognize scripturally that whosoever curses Israel is cursed and whoever blesses Israel is blessed uh that scripture holds true yet today you know this nation according to a prophet of God brother brandham a the prophet of God 1956 said that uh America would either accept or reject God and we say well did he accept it or re rejected well in 1957 he said they rejected God so that kind of settles that question uh in 1956 1957 you say well how has this nation been so prosperous how has it been so good how has it gone forth the way it's been able to go under a curse but or after actually having rejected God but you have to understand that even even back then and even up till the recent time Israel uh uh America the United States of America has been very good friends with Israel they have been our number one partner in the Middle East uh we have been uh shared uh uh democracy and and many many things together but it but America has always helped Israel America's usually at least always taken care of Israel been there for Israel right when others have raised up against Israel America's been there with them America's been there for them amen and America's helped to take care of them because they've been uh our Ally they've been our friend we've been their friend so to understand that a lot of and now this in my opinion a lot of what America has been able to uh overcome even though she's turned her back on God is that the scripture says that whoever blesses Israel is blessed that's what the Bible says that's what Bam's prophecy was that still holds true that brother R said that still holds true today so if whoever blesses Israel is blessed if America has blessed Israel over the years even after that time then we understand that Israel is yet still or or America is yet still going to be blessed right amen because she has blessed Israel right she's been a friend to Israel she's helped Israel now we're getting to a place now look I've seen a lot lot going on friend and as you can see it and I'm not a uh brother Brown preached modern events made clear about prophecy but he did not preach prophecy made clear by modern events so I do not preach prophecies becoming clear by modern events not doing that but a understanding or a wakening up of of understanding of where we're at today and what's going on if you see very subtle un under the radar even in a lot of ways because the lot of people keep talking about this that and the other and and of course the presidential race in this country and that kind of thing but the underlying theme of a lot of things that's going on in the world and in our nation now in our nation it's becoming very much an anti-israel Nation again now I know it's been a small amount but it seems to be growing all the time right uh you see these very anti-israel uh uh uh protest thank you protest coming at at schools and very little done about them very little done about them I mean they gone on for months and months Define school policy defying schools rules defying the things that that the schools have set up have set forth defying all that and the and and the school does nothing right now they finally started to a couple of presidents have resigned and stuff but but the underlying theme of it is the overall uh acceptance of anti-israel fervor today and we know that's going to happen we know that according to Zachariah all the all the nations all around Israel is going to come against them amen but what would Israel be if America turns its back on Israel now let's leave the protest and look at the foundation of our government we have helped Israel through this war now how could you not I mean really it it through a terrorist organization to fly in and Slaughter thousands of of innocent Jews for basically no reason just because they're terrorists kill them rape them murder to the women and the babies and the children who can blame them right but there's also been another sentiment that kind kind of still a little bit under the radar but you keep your ear to the ground long enough you understand you can see the things that's happening and then and and and what's being said even in uh our government uh the foundation of our country whether we support Israel or not see there can be thousands or tens or hundreds or millions of uh citizens that still support Israel but if the foundation of our federal government doesn't that's the representation of who we are as people brother random said it whether I like it or not I'm an American and whether I like it or not my government represents me amen and unfortunately in too many ways I don't like it uh at all but understanding that that that Foundation there has has had some inklings against Israel to speak against them to withhold uh uh weaponry and things like that uh to come against him and say Israel should not be doing this who is who are they that's over there to say we shouldn't be doing it they're defending their citizens and I don't blame a I don't blame a mama a bear for defending her clubs at all much less would I come against a nation who's trying to take care of their own people I I wish our nation did that yeah uh it's come to the place that our nation doesn't seem to care about its people uh murders rapes crimes whatever it is that just hardly don't seem to care you hardly hear much about it amen but the point of it is whoever blesses Israel's bless whoever curses Israel's curse now what's coming next now we don't know what's coming next God knows amen God knows what's coming next but I know that uh there's a very real possibility that this nation after the election could take a very very hard turn against Israel right amen amen a very hard turn against Israel by a person who has supported a lot of the protest that's been going on against Israel yes did you imagine now if that happens where's this nation going to be if what this nation has been hanging on really since it was uh had rejected God uh 70 years ago what almost 70 years ago if if it's been going along since that time because she's been a friend to Israel because she's blessed Israel what's going to happen if she turns her back on Israel and basically curses Israel what's going to happen to this country if that's the thing that's been holding this country together what's going to happen if that goes away right where is this country going to be right what's going to happen if the fervor around the world is becoming to that place as well what is going to happen to the what is going to happen to this world friend I'm not again I'm not trying to make a prophecy come real just by preaching something but I also understand we're living in real times we're living in times and again uh uh uh I'll make this statement I heard brother randam when he was uh mentioning that 60 almost 60 years ago about how late it was and about how the things were shaping up and how I couldn't believe that by the way things were shaping up that we could last that much longer well how much more now 60 years later do we see these things happening and not only that but all of the other Wicked evil things that's taking place in the in the world and in our country the literal legalization of things that are absolutely antis scripture right anti- word anti- god what happens to a nation when it turns its back on God well now what happens to a nation when it not only has turned its back on God but turned its back on God's friend Israel right what's going to happen to us and now amen now that's going to take place now amen let's go back over to Numbers chapter 22 let's get into the story a little [Music] bit there's good nuances in the story bam was a prophet of God he was a true prophet of God he had according to brother R he had the same Spirit on him to prophesy as Moses had on him as the prophet of God Amen the things that baam prophesy I.E whoever blesses Israel is blessed whoever curses Israel is cursed are still true today absolutely true today amen but the error that balam made wasn't his prophecies because he did even though he really kind of didn't want to he did say what God told him to say amen that's why he said that that's the only reason it was able to stay that way now look let's go Numbers chapter 22 uh we'll just start with verse one and the children of Israel set forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan by Jericho and bailo the son of zapor saw all that Israel had done to the amorites now Bao was the king at that time and Moab was sore afraid of the people because uh they were many and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel Moab said unto the Elders of Midian now shall this company lick up all that are around about us as a ox lith up the grassp the field Bao the son of zor was King of the moabites at that time he sent Messengers therefore unto balam now look at the wickedness of Moab he sent Messengers therefore unto balum the son of uh beor to pathor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to uh to call him saying behold there is a people come out of Egypt behold they cover the face of the Earth and they abide over against me come now therefore I pray thee curse me this people and this is of course uh Bao's desire for them for for balam to come and curse the people so so just like this comes forth a lot of things you hear today uh I is this to be a prophecy from God or is this just something that a man or a person or a group has said or thought or believed he's trying to put this king of Moab bam is trying to before balam even comes put words in his mouth thus prophesy such well that's just a hirling prophet that's just like that's just like the uh uh the the 400 prophets that uh that Ahab had it's the same thing just hiring prophets right let's call as Joe Jose came up with Ahab he said let let me call my 400 prophets and see if this is of the Lord well if every one of the 400 prophets is some hireling Prophet they're not going to say what God says they're going to say what the man wants to hear well this is what bailo is trying to set balum up for to say only what I say prophesy it the way I want it to be prophesied which was what come I pray thee and curse me this people that's what he wanted BM to do just come and curse these people now obviously jat had just enough God in him to say isn't there one more I mean was 400 not good enough for you you want one more well there's one more his name is Michael but I hate him he's always speaking against me oh don't let the king say so bring him out here and they went and got him and they did the exact same thing to Micah they said now Micah four all these 400 prophets have been in unison together to speak good for the king to speak good of Ahab to speak good of their desire to go up with Jehoshaphat it's all been good now if you can just come see putting that seat trying to get him Ju Ju Just say what he want you to hear amen oh that's not a prophet right amen a prophet doesn't would just say what the people want to hear or say what you think they want to hear say what they no but see they he they come to him and say now now this is all been in unison they've all spoke together in one mind said everybody's in agreement for Ahab to go up and of course like a true man of God will one out of a million however many one in 400 this time I guess he said I'll say only what God tells me to say can you imagine the eye rolling you could probably heard their eyes roll oh here we go again we're going to get in trouble but that's what Ahab said we'll bring him out here anyway God gave it God gave Micah a dream and says I see Israel on the hill scattered Like Chief having no Shepherd in other words if you go up you're going to die amen praise the Lord and what happened exactly what Micah said what happened to the 400 Prophets You know what happens to a hireling Prophet this is the same situation bot's trying to get trying to already plant a seed to have balum come and just all I want you to do bam is just come and say what you're going to say they already know he's a prophet amen but he's a prophet of Moab so he's a prophet of along the same lines as a hireling prophet but he had enough God at least at this time to say only what God put in his heart but look now I pray thee curse me this people for they too uh uh for they are too Mighty for me per Adventure I shall Prevail that we may Smite them and that I may drive them out of the land for I was that uh that he whom thou blesses is blessed and he whom thou curses is cursed so we know BM you're a prophet we know that what you say from God is true amen we know that your prophecy whoever you curse is cursed and whoever is blessed is blessed we know that so come here now and curse him for me we know you say what God says well then okay then I'm going to say what God says not what you're telling me to say right amen but at least bam had that much and the Elders of of Moab the Elders of Midian departed with the now look this is how wicked and evil Moab was now we know where Moab come now Moab obvious we know was the family uh was the son of lot and his oldest daughter and his oldest daughter actually his oldest and youngest daughter got got a lot drunk and laid with him the oldest daughter had had Moab as a result and how Wicked it of course devolved from there seventh verse the elders the Elders of Moab and the Elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination or witchcraft you can see how how demonic they already had gotten because they were going to take the rewards of Witchcraft to Bam as a reward we're going to reward you with witchcraft thou man of God how Wicked evil see and understand and and me and my wife's gotten these conversations before a lot of people doing these things they're they're under an anointing friend understand they're under an anointing they're they're they're doing what they believe is the correct thing to do and they don't see anything wrong with taking witchcraft as a reward to a man of God right they don't see anything wrong with that and people in the world is the same way today they don't see any they don't say anything wrong with that I had a guy a couple weeks ago asked me we had worked with this uh with this other team before we worked with them when we were uh in Spokane I believe I can't remember now anyway um and he came up to me and I was out in the work trailer he said uh are you still preaching I said yeah I still so Pastor have church and all and the next words out of his mouth was cussing yeah I think something that you would think is a somewhat civilized conversation of of asking about God and Ministry and church and the next thing but they don't think anything about it right it doesn't mean anything to them amen right it it goes they're under that anointing they're under that spirit that that's where they live that's who they are we look at it and think why would you think to a man of God that you consider him a prophet of God why would you think a reward of Witchcraft would be a proper uh reward but that it's the same Spirit today it doesn't mean anything to them but that's how bad that's how far moah had gotten the rewards of of Divination in their hand and they came to bear and SP balam and spake unto him the words of baalam and he said unto them Lodge here this night and I will bring you word again as the Lord shall speak unto me and the princes of Moab Abode with balam now fortunately again bam had enough that his prophecy was going to be correct according to what God Said and God came unto Baum and said what men are these with thee now God knows what men those are God knows everything there's nothing God doesn't know but what's he doing just like in the Garden of Eden God's testing BM amen because God look God knows balam he knows who balam is Right amen he knows the gift this gift is on bam because remember gifts and callings are without repentance he knows his gifts there so he's testing bam do you know who these people are do you know who you're giving uh your time and energy and effort do you know who you're you're conversing with do you know these people cuz God knows them this isn't a question like it's like God coming in the Garden of Eden uh like a a blind man in a black dark room with no light looking for a black cat that's not there where are you Adam where are you but God knows exactly where Adam was right he's testing Adam Adam do you know where you are do you know what you've done do you know what's happened now he's doing the same thing to b b do you know who these people are do you know they have brought rewards of Witchcraft demonic evil stuff to reward you for your prophecy do you know who these people are bam said to God bailo the son of zippor King of Moab has sent unto me saying behold there is a people come out of Egypt which covers the face of the Earth come now curse me them per Adventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out now that's that and honestly I believe that was balam's desire this hirling Prophet really wanted to find a nice place of stature unfortunately that's the same spirit that happens today too amen so many people whether they actually have a gift of Prophecy or they're just making things up uh and give Prophecies of things that you can't even prove you will never be tested because they can't be time can't test some prophecies because it's so generic there's nothing to it right but that's people believe them uh maybe maybe they're real had that gift of Prophecy maybe don't I don't know but we'll get to the bottom line of who you can trust with it and who you can't just a little bit but balam wouldn't be going through all this if his desire wasn't for God to do this because he just like balo's doing to balum balam's trying to do to God well God if you just let you know this is what he wants this is what he wants you know and God said unto bam Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed why do you think I'm sending them forth to lick up all the like The Oxen with the grass why do you think that they're winning every Victory every battle why do you think that they're everything they do is blessed why do you think that they cover the whole world they do that because I'm with them yeah amen do not curse them for they are blessed do not go with those men do not give bail the time of day and when God says it he means it God does not need to repeat himself right God does not need to rethink it God does not need to put it in different words he said said no that means no Amen period that's the end of it no more discussion no more begging no more asking no more pleading no more coming to say well maybe he will have changed his mind by now no God does not change his mind he said no and he meant no and what no means no no is from God bam rose up in the morning said unto the princes of baa get you into your land for the Lord refuseth to give me Le to leave to go with you now he didn't tell him the other part he just said God is just not going to let me go with you to do what Bao wants the prince of Mo uh of Moab rose up went unto Bao and uh and said balam refuseth to come with us God said no When God says no he means it amen so bam goes to them and says I can't go with you God says I can't go uh I can't come out and play today no tell them the truth that people's blessed God told me they are blessed and if you want any hope of survival you should probably follow along with what they believe and say no no he just said that God's just not going to let me go with you today he goes to God again Moab I'm G stop my reading there Moab uh sends bot uh sends him again and even even more important people in his cabinet and sends him down and says bam uh are you sure can we just convince you uh we'll give you anything we'll do anything am and Bam says even if B give me his whole house full of silver and gold I can only say what God tells me but then what does he do he then turns around says but hold on a second spend another night here with me and I'll go ask him again [Music] that tells you right there even though balam said though he give me a house full of silver and gold I can only say what God Said but he's still he's still hoping maybe God just might let him go and get that house of silver gold or divinations or whatever B's trying to offer him whatever it might be I just all that being said just just give me another minute hold on here stay another night I'm going go ask God again God said no God meant no amen and Bam comes and say and and God says okay go ahead go with them going do it anyway that's what he says a lot of time amen people come say well God told me well how many times you ask him you know sometimes God tests us God's just testing bam again I already told you no what are you going to do now okay go ahead go so bam goes in the test that God gives him God still goes God didn't say you could go God said No period that was God's answer okay go ahead and go bam you're going to do it anyway so bam goes over and the guy said hey God God told me I could go with you uh yeah not quite balum but God said I can go with you and and one of the most Sublime stories in the whole scripture starts to shape up uh I I want to read this uh I think it's let's see here it's still in Numbers 22 because balum is now going he Saddles up now there's a there's a word in here I'm going to replace with mule so if you forgive me because it said a lot children here I don't really want to say that word because the way the word has gotten to be today right scripturally it should be fine but you understand what I'm saying I'll replace it with mule but 22 uh verse 22 so bam decides to go up and when he he decides he he Saddles up his mule and he goes with the princes of Moab and God's anger was kindled because he went because I told you no well but then you told me yeah no but God doesn't change his mind see sometimes God tests us yes to see what we're going to do what is really in my heart is is it really in my heart to obey God or is it really in my heart to want to go do this right or obain this or whatever it is amen and God will test us okay you can go ahead see what happens go ahead how many times do we end up in God's permissive will even right and I can just imagine God said sure go ahead see what happens did you go ahead I'll let you go amen but you'll find out later that was not a good decision God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way now this is a funny one too for the kids um know if they're listening but the children here angel of the Lord uh the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against bam against him now he was riding upon his mule and his two servants were with him and the mule saw the angel the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the mule turned aside out of the way and went into the field and B him smoke the mule to turn her into the way now there's an angel of God standing there and this dumb brute animal is more cogniz it of the Angel of the Lord than the prophet of God right amen help us Lord a a dumb a brute mule is more aware of the angel of God than the prophet of God is that shows you exactly where Bam's at but God said go ahead you'll find out amen thankfully bam had this mual that he was riding the angel Lord stood in the path of The Vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side now he's trapped he's in between two walls and an angel of the Lord is blocking their way and when the mule saw the angel of the Lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balam's foot against the wall and he smote her again the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and when the mule saw the Ang of the Lord she fell down under balum and balam's anger was kindled and he smoked the mule with a staff he continued to beat her and beat her because first she crushed him against the wall now she's just going to fight down to the ground I am not going any further you can go if you want but I'm not going I am not going to I am not going to face that angel of God with that sword drawn in their hand I'm not going to do it she falls flat down and he keeps beating her and again one of the most Sublime parts of the scripture kind of gets up there with iron floating you know the Lord opened the mouth of the mule and she said unto bam what have I done unto thee that thou H has smitten me these three times now can you imagine the man of God the the the prophet of God standing there does not recognize the angel of the Lord is there mule Falls straight to the ground he keeps beating her and she turns around and looks at him and says what are you beating me for amen I've been a good mu to you i' I've I've taken you everywhere You' wanted to go I've done everything you've asked of me why are you beating me so bad these three times you imagine Not only was the mule speaking to him bam said unto the mule because thou has mocked me I would there were a sword in sword in mine hand for now would I kill thee now the man's having a conversation with his mule now that's straight jacket territory there that's rubber room land that that's you start talking to a mule hearing the mule talk back CU in my opinion there's probably if there were anybody else around nobody would else nobody else would hear this meal talking if this was only for B they might hear hear or something but they wouldn't hear the mule talking this was for BB they think the man's crazy because he's sitting there talking to her and he says if I had a sword I'd kill you right now and that mule saved the man's life and the mule said unto balam am I not thy mule upon which thou has ridden ever since uh I was thine unto this day was I ever wrought to do so unto thee and he said nay in the I I just love that part amen I've been a good mule done everything you ask and now You' Bea me to death why would you do that I've done everything you've wanted me to do I've been a good haven't I done all of this since since I was with you youve rode me everywhere yeah yeah then the Lord opened the eyes of bam and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face the angel of the Lord said unto here wherefore hast thou smitten thy mule these three times behold I went out to withand thee because thy way is per verse before me why are you beating your mule she's the one that saved your life if you had kept going on this way you'd be dead she saved you and the mule saw me and turned for me these three these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also I had slain thee and saved her alive amen bam said to the Ang of the Lord I have sinned for I knew not that thou stood Us in the way against me now therefore it if it displease Thee I will get back me again well that's what I told you to begin with but and the angel of the Lord said unto bam go with the men but only the word that I shall speak unto thee that shall thou uh Thou shalt speak so bam went with the princes of Bao for the purpose of for the purpose of he giving that appropriate prophecy for today Amen in that came the prophecy that we read starting this message whoever blesses Israel is blessed whoever curses Israel is cursed you are like a unicorn strong and mighty nation you are a blessed Nation God is with you God is still with them saints regardless of what it looks like regardless of all that they went through amen regardless of the sins that they've committed and such and so forth God is still with them and they are still a blessed people amen and whoever blesses them and is blessed whoever curses them is cursed so he could only he could only Bless the people bless Israel he can only bless them he could do nothing else but bless them and of course after that warning of the Angel of the Lord standing there that would have killed him if he had continued on he was only going to say what God told him to say to the displeasure of Bao who clapped his hands and got mad and and riled up against Bao and but but the more the more and even with that Bao went three times and Bor went with him every time okay I I'll take you here and here's will your curse them and he takes in there and Bam says okay set up seven altars seven Rams seven bullog same same thing Moses did same offerings amen same thing that God had done with through Moses bam had enough he knew that that was the way to do it he said set up seven altars and and he came forth and all he did was bless Israel Ba got mad goes to another spot okay here's where you curse them okay set up seven off and B went with him every single time all three times not only did he go to God twice when God the first time told him no now he goes on to three places one a high place of course and says now curse Israel but all that could come out of his mouth was blessings amen even when he said it all up that way so balum could not curse God so what or Israel so what did he do he couldn't curse her so she so he taught her to commit fornication he taught her to leave and disobey the word of God that was the thing that guided yes he was a prophet his prophecy was true but the same thing that it is today you say you want a test I give you a test are the trinitarians do they believe in three gods did he baptize in the father son the Holy Ghost amen free unclean frogs the names of which are damnable in the eyes of God right amen father son holy ghost I tell you how to find out do they do they do they teach the word today word of the hour right amen I'm not saying that there aren't people out there that don't have gifts of Prophecy but the test is what do they preach right where do they stand if they believe in three Gods I'm sorry they it might be their prophecy might be right but I'm I'm not going to listen to it right amen I believe in the message of the hour amen and I know it's the truth and there's nobody or anything that's going to get me off of that period period And I will say it again big period yeah and in that message that Vindicated Prophet said that rapturing faith lies in this message right well if rapturing if if I want to go in a Rapture and I and and I'm anxious if you will in some cases ready to go to a Rapture take place Lord in any moment and there's rapturing faith in here why do I why would I want to listen to anybody else I don't mean that derogatory I don't mean that me and I'm not saying that the things that some are preaching maybe they may be from the word it may be good lessons but if I want rapturing Faith that's more than just a good lesson that is something that's going to take me out of this world if rapturing face in the message why don't I listen to anybody else amen now if you do that's your choice I'm not saying you do what you feel led to do I'm giving you my conviction amen I'm telling you where I stand in my conviction and right now friend I'm not looking for a new Revival amen I know the bride's having her Revival absolutely but I'm not looking for a widespread worldwide International Revival I I'm not looking for uh all these so many things that people say well uh well America this will switch America over and she'll get back on the right track no she's doomed she's done she's finished yes there's nothing left for her but a bomb that's going to burn her border border Coast to Coast amen I'm not looking for that what am I looking for I'm looking for a rapture am that's the day and the hour that we're living that's the anointing that's the message amen that this bride this last day bride is preparing herself to go meet her Lord in a Rapture yes praise God that's what my anointing is that's what my focus is that's the pro point and purpose behind all of our existence today yes amen amen I'm ready to go in a Rapture amen amen praise the Lord you want to see God face to face one that's the best way I know of to do it yes amen but he but what bam did then was teach the people against the word he gave them he could not prophesy against them so what did he do he taught them to commit whoredoms with the with the people of Moab he came in as we've said this uh several forgot when it was it's been a while back but we're all one we're all the same people let's just all come together and Nar in together and all these and just become one and that absolutely was aive God look at what brother brandom said [Music] here look at he said what happened the church has got started out of Egypt on its feet a few days and what happened Satan come along with his discrepancy in the person the second came which was balum so discrepancy among them we know that's right that balam the teaching of balum that we all the same we serve the same God you do fundamentally he was right they were all family remember Moab was the was the son of lot lot was Abraham's nephew yes they were family but they weren't one they weren't the same one followed God and one followed the devil right one believed in God and and and and and the word that he gave them and the others brought witchcraft no they were not the same right yes they were family yes he had the seven altars and all the Pomp and Circumstance and all the things yeah people build the churches and they got their Bibles and they they go this way they do the the the rituals and the things and all that yeah that's all the same but spiritually they're light night and day not even the close to the same but bam taught them they were the same amen we're all one look now fundamentally he was right he offered the same sacrifice that God offered seven Rams seven Bullocks seven altars prayed the same God just as perfect to Moses did down in the wilderness just exactly the same but they were not the same foreshadowing to us what would come to pass there was again Cain manifested in the person of bam and there was God manifested in the person of Moses interpreting his word through a human being making himself known his promise through a human being and the discrepancy raised up so did it at the time of Judas there came with a discrepancy and remember remember brother Ram said this is that those people believe that they were all the same we worship the same God we should all belong to the same church we should all be the same people that sin never was forgiven Israel Jesus said himself there are all dead choosing law over Grace right amen that sin was never forgiven you can find it over in second Peter you can find it over in Revelation even in the Third Church age even in the pamus church age that was something that God held against the Third Church age was that they believ that doctrine of balum not the prophecy of balum the doctrine the teaching that's where it meets friend that's where your unpardonable sin is amen it's not mistakes and false failures things that you do no it's in rejecting of the pure True Word of God amen amen that sin was never forgiven them they perished all but three of them amen now numbers 25 I'll close with this the Israel numbers 251 in Israel Abode in shittum the people began to commit whoredoms with the daughters of Moab how was that so because they were unequally Yol right amen they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bow down to their gods bowed down to their gods a people the New Testament says that were once enlightened oh my where is it at today friend a people that were once enlightened where are they now they bowed down to their gods and Israel joined himself unto bpor the the uh God uh of the devil I forgot the word I'm trying to say but deity and uh and and wickedness or evil B peor they joined themselves un B peor the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and the Lord said unto Moses take all the heads of the people hang them up before the Lord against the Son and the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel Moses said unto the judges of Israel slay ye every one of his men that were born joined unto belor now a man of God a true man of God with the word of God is now coming to correct the mistake to make it right God is giving him the way and behold one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethen a Brethren a menish woman into the sight of Moses and the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who are Weeping before the door of the Tabernacle the congregation and when Phineas the son of el elazar the son son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand went in after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through their be through her belly so the plague was saved from the children of Israel and those that died in the plague were 20 and 4,000 the plague why a plague remember a sin that was never forgiven not because of a prophecy but because of a word a false word of being off the word of bringing word that was not inspired by God he said well it is true well so is so is what Satan so is what the serpent told Eve in the Garden of Eden what Eve told Garden uh what the serpent told Eve in the Garden of Eden was true your eyes will be open did their eyes open yes did you know that you were naked in yes is what he told her right yes but it's not according to God's word amen God said don't touch it that's his word yes that's the end of it there's no discussion so but God maybe could I just possibly have done no that was his word it period end of the discussion praise the Lord let me read this as I close here now amen he talks about the same anointing on balam's on Moses balum false anointed ones at the end time or anointed ones at the end time balum Anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching the teaching of Moses was perfect the Bible said here in second Peter that it was the teaching of balam that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sin not one of them got saved though they had come out of the blessings of God and seen the hand of God moving with his mighty Prophet seen it exactly Vindicated by God and because another Prophet come in with a teaching contrary disputed with Moses and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong Dayan and cor and many of them agreed with him and taught the children of Israel to commit fornication to go after uh to go after his organization that were all the same whether we're methus Baptist president prian Pentecostals what more we're all the same we are not he says we are not the same amen so oh they worship the same God yeah we go to church we go to church on Sunday too yeah our preacher gets up and preaches the message you know his message comes from the Bible yeah our does too you can so on so forth oh yeah well we we must all just be the same then no not the same amen there's a stark difference between the two groups there is a huge remember it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible praise God it's not possible but elect be deceived and thank you Lord Jesus for making me elect amen they cannot be deceived they are not the same we are not the same you are a separated people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word the spirit of God to Bear the fruit of his promise for this day you are not of them the church and the bride is two separate groups amen amen your bride not of them yes amen I know that's awful strong but that's the truth just to saying dedicated to the service in this last days as as as uh Revelation 18 says come out of her my people and be not partakers of her witchcraft yes of her sin what is witchcraft anything that's against God's word amen anything that's against God's word you said well you got to come and cut the head of a chicken off and have all these divinations and an upside down Cross or whatever and all this stuff and all this pump and no you don't no you don't just disobey just disbelieve God's word disobey disbelieve uh run aunder the the pure word of God that's witchcraft right amen that's denying Jesus Christ denying the word is denying Jesus Christ amen and anybody that does that is not a part of you trying to teach you into believing that there's three gods that is demonic yes trying to teach you into believing that the correct baptism is Jesus's way of baptism is the father name of the father son the holy ghost when Father Son and Holy Ghost aren't even named right is demonic yes I don't care who they are and I'm sorry again as brother R said that might be awful strong but that's the truth friend that's where it is and we know that that's where God the separation amen it's not that prophecies right wrong okay that's fine and good but what do you teach what's your word what you bringing me see bam was right in his prophecy it was his teaching that was wrong it was his teaching that caused Israel Israel's fatal mistake causing them to commit fornication against God by through or rejecting of the word right amen yeah they accepted and worshiped other idols and stuff but that wasn't it it was the rejection of his word is what did it amen God help us we believe that word it's the truth amen his word is true forever settled in heaven we don't dare God help us come against it or contrary to it or Lord just help me to be obedient to it amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could God help this nation if we get to that place I mean I say that but I I say that in the same life that I say she's doomed but we're still here there's a little bit of Grace that can be had friend then I want it yeah I'm ready to go home yes I'm ready for Rapture but if God wants to give a little more grace maybe one more Soul come in right one Soul's worth 10 million worlds and I say praise the Lord yes that that's great uh Let It Be Lord amen but then conversely if it's God's time and if it's our time to go and if God is moving us out of this place and because we're becoming less and less this world world's this world is we're looking less and less like anything that resembles godliness today then I say then I say Lord if it's that time and that person and that place and whatever then let it be amen I'm not going to try to talk God out of it it's up to him what his decision is and remember as far as the presidency goes of this country now the Bible says God puts them in right and takes them down so that's up to him what he does Amen he's the one that does it so whichever way uh it's up to him I know which way I want and my way is I want our country to get back at at least a semblance of what it once was it'll never get back to what it once was but at least in some way amen then praise the Lord I know that's what I desire but if that's not the will of the Lord then whatever his will is and that's what I want to do amen praise the Lord Jesus let's sing this uh well maybe we'll sing the verses I don't know just any now we'll sing the we'll sing the chorus at least anyway but maybe we'll sing a verse of it just any day now our Lord is coming you believe that I do amen with all my heart just any day now my Lord is coming praise the Lord let's
