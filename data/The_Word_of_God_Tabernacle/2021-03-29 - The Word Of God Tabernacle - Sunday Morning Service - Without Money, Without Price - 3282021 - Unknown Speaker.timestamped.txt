[34:52] you must be
[35:02] yes sir that's the truth isn't it it's
[35:05] faith that moves the hand of god
[35:07] you just believe that amen you know
[35:09] sometimes
[35:11] uh so many times people are waiting for
[35:14] god to move
[35:16] everybody keeps talking about god just
[35:18] waiting for god to
[35:19] move god would you move god would you do
[35:21] this you know sometimes god's waiting on
[35:23] us to move
[35:23] that's right god's waiting on us to make
[35:25] a step god's waiting on us to make a
[35:27] commitment
[35:28] god's waiting for us to take that step
[35:30] in that leap of faith
[35:32] if we can make that move then god says
[35:33] i'll meet you there
[35:35] so sometimes it didn't just wait and say
[35:37] god just move we'll move you know
[35:39] can't just sit down and say well god
[35:40] move god wants us to move
[35:42] god's sometimes waiting for us if we
[35:44] could just understand to get to that
[35:46] place of entering in i know it's been
[35:48] said so many times
[35:49] that he entering in and of worship of
[35:52] entering in and that
[35:53] praise of entering into that friend you
[35:56] see how god meets you there
[35:58] and because he inhabits the praises of
[36:00] his people so we just praise him
[36:02] worship him amen and just enter into
[36:04] that just make that move
[36:06] you say well i'm an introvert i don't i
[36:08] don't say much
[36:09] i don't i'm not very loud or boisterous
[36:11] god never asked me to be loud and
[36:13] boisterous he just asked you to worship
[36:14] him
[36:15] just praise him praise him in your own
[36:17] way but sometimes god's just waiting for
[36:19] that move from us
[36:20] to lift that hand or to give that
[36:23] gesture to sing that song or
[36:25] whatever it is and just wait and let god
[36:27] move and flow through
[36:29] you and flow through this uh there's
[36:31] this service this congregation here see
[36:34] sometimes it just takes just a little
[36:35] bit for god to enter in and god comes in
[36:38] and then when he comes in he meets you
[36:40] there then
[36:40] then you know what happened see see this
[36:43] is palm sunday
[36:45] as we worship and and thank god for palm
[36:48] sunday but
[36:49] palm sunday is that victorious return of
[36:51] the lord jesus
[36:52] people he came down through a a borrowed
[36:56] donkey
[36:57] he come down an alleyway and they
[37:00] worshiped him and they praised him and
[37:02] they
[37:02] uh threw palms and uh out in the
[37:06] out in the way and just worshiped him
[37:08] and said hosanna
[37:10] amen in the highest blessed be than him
[37:12] that comes in the name of the lord
[37:14] praise the lord jesus and and when they
[37:16] did that jesus come running
[37:19] riding down the way amen and they got to
[37:21] see
[37:22] it an appearance by the lord jesus amen
[37:25] god sweet to this place well lord but
[37:28] but jesus says well i want you to
[37:29] worship me
[37:30] i want you to praise me i want you to i
[37:33] want you to do something that that
[37:35] that that brings the inhabitation of of
[37:38] the spirit of god upon us
[37:39] and we do that and we see the moving of
[37:41] god he said well praise the lord see
[37:43] you get the touch of the lord right uh
[37:46] that that song that
[37:48] that zach sang is very dear to our
[37:50] hearts me and my wife because
[37:52] it wasn't long after our first son had
[37:54] passed away that we got in front of the
[37:55] whole church and
[37:56] and we sang blessed assurance i believe
[37:59] it was that the
[38:00] um it may have been micah's dedication
[38:03] we sang
[38:04] because after our first son had passed
[38:05] away and we got i believe it was a
[38:08] his dedication we sang blessed assurance
[38:10] and
[38:11] that blessed assurance was something
[38:13] that um that entered into our hearts
[38:15] when we were
[38:16] remembering back at uh you know because
[38:18] it hadn't even been a whole year
[38:20] that the the lord took um uh georgie our
[38:23] first son
[38:24] home to be with him and you know it was
[38:26] a very hard time
[38:27] very trying time but you know we just
[38:30] you just can't sit back on the seat of
[38:32] do nothing you can't
[38:34] you know sit in that little corner and
[38:36] have your pity party
[38:37] but you know because god knows best and
[38:40] we just continue to press the battle
[38:42] amen and in all things we gave him
[38:44] praise and all things we gave him glory
[38:46] and honor
[38:47] and know that he was going to take care
[38:48] of it all and he did amen
[38:51] may never understand why it happened but
[38:53] i know one thing
[38:56] my wife and myself and testified to
[38:59] probably tens of thousands of people
[39:02] about what the lord did and i know it's
[39:04] helped a lot of people because a lot of
[39:05] people come and say that and i don't
[39:06] know if that's
[39:07] why it happened that way we may never
[39:09] know but god just says just
[39:12] just take that step amen sometimes it's
[39:14] just taking that step you say well
[39:16] brother you just come so easy to you
[39:18] know it doesn't
[39:19] it never has uh i've told you before
[39:22] getting in front of a group of people
[39:24] was not something i did
[39:26] i was very very much an introvert
[39:29] uh i had my little circle of friends
[39:31] when i was in north carolina but then
[39:32] when i came to arizona i had no friends
[39:35] i had nothing i was just like a clam
[39:37] that was
[39:38] you just couldn't open with a stick of
[39:40] dynamite
[39:41] i was very much an introvert you can ask
[39:43] my wife
[39:44] she came up and spoke to me first time
[39:46] she ever said anything to me
[39:48] uh she said something about my voice and
[39:49] i just said thank you
[39:52] that's probably the most i'd spoke to
[39:53] anybody outside of my parents and
[39:56] i don't know how long and probably the
[39:57] last time i spoke to anybody for a long
[39:59] time after that
[40:01] uh when it didn't come it doesn't come
[40:04] easy
[40:04] but you know once you just make that
[40:06] move just give that effort and
[40:09] you just let the lord take over then
[40:10] then it's not you anymore then it's him
[40:13] amen and then he he inhabits the praises
[40:16] of his people
[40:17] praise the lord i feel his presence here
[40:19] today don't you
[40:20] i know he's here i feel his presence
[40:25] it's just so special saints we just
[40:27] enter into that
[40:28] and and just know that god is going to

[40:41] little bit so i don't get ahead of
[40:43] myself but sometimes
[40:44] i just say you know what you do

[41:23] believe it's that
[41:24] time was just praise and worship the
[41:26] lord
[41:27] amen glorified it's palm sunday that's
[41:30] what they did
[41:31] the triumphant king rode through the
[41:33] city and they worshipped him and they
[41:35] praised him
[41:36] they gave him glory honor they threw the
[41:38] palms and all they did to
[41:40] praise the lord jesus amen so that's
[41:43] what we do
[41:44] we worship him he inhabits those praises
[41:46] too amen praise the lord let's stand if
[41:48] we could now
[41:49] we're going to turn our bibles to isaiah
[41:51] chapter 55.
[41:55] i had a little thing that i was going to
[42:01] message i thought i would bring today
[42:03] and
[42:05] as i studied on it stayed on it the the
[42:08] deeper it got the more involved it got
[42:10] and i said well
[42:11] this isn't going to be one service
[42:17] and next sunday lord willing i had
[42:19] something that laura put on my hearts
[42:20] kind of for a little bit of an easter
[42:22] message so
[42:23] i didn't want to cut it in half and have
[42:25] the easter message in the middle and
[42:26] then the lord put this on my heart
[42:29] and then i started thinking how well it
[42:31] would go with
[42:32] the palm sunday and then easter coming
[42:34] up so i just trusted me a blessing to
[42:36] you but
[42:37] before we read the word of god let's
[42:39] just bow our heads for another word of
[42:40] prayer if we could
[42:41] lord jesus father we are indeed grateful
[42:44] father for all that you do for us for
[42:46] your blessings your love for
[42:47] watching over protecting us lord just
[42:50] the sheer knowledge lord and faith to
[42:52] believe that god you are always there
[42:54] that you never leave us
[42:55] or forsake us god we've tried you we've
[42:58] proved you we
[42:59] know you to be a man of your word we
[43:01] know you to do what you said you would
[43:03] do god
[43:04] and by faith we believe today that you
[43:06] are here because the promise of your
[43:08] word says that where two or three are
[43:10] gathered in your name
[43:11] you would be there lord in the midst and
[43:13] we're so thankful god for you being here
[43:16] lord for the promise of your word we
[43:18] know that by faith
[43:19] it moves the hand of god lord sometimes
[43:22] we expect things just to be paved so
[43:24] perfectly right and
[43:26] lord just say god we have faith and you
[43:28] know we believe but
[43:29] faith doesn't always make things easy it
[43:32] just makes them possible
[43:33] and we know that god if we believe that
[43:35] it would be possible
[43:36] it might not happen today it might not
[43:38] happen tomorrow it might not be on that
[43:41] beautiful smooth paved road god but lord

[43:54] streaming today and pray that you would
[43:56] speak to us from your word once again
[43:59] we rebuke every demonic spirit of hell
[44:01] that would try to hurt hinder and
[44:03] filtrate this service in any way
[44:05] that you would get the glory honor and
[44:06] praise for all this that had done here
[44:08] and lord as brother john has already
[44:10] said may what is said and done here
[44:12] today god be pleasing to you and
[44:14] help us to draw closer to you lord in
[44:17] this time that you've given us today
[44:19] father that's our whole motive that's

[44:24] learn of you
[44:25] father to you for you to speak to us
[44:27] lord we all need that little boost of
[44:30] faith that little extra encouragement

[44:34] lives and needs and
[44:35] lord the prayer request is very
[44:40] very many of them lord god but lord we
[44:42] know that you have met them everyone
[44:44] we thank you god for all that you do and
[44:46] done and going to do
[44:48] we commit the remaining part of this
[44:49] service in your hands in the name of the
[44:51] lord jesus christ
[44:53] and to you be all glory honor and praise
[44:55] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[44:58] amen amen
[45:01] isaiah 55 begin with verse 1
[45:08] ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to
[45:11] the waters
[45:12] and ye that hath no money come ye buy
[45:15] and eat
[45:15] ye come buy wine and milk without money
[45:19] and without price wherefore do ye spend
[45:22] money for that which is not bread
[45:24] and your labor for that which satisfyeth
[45:27] not
[45:28] hearken diligently unto me and ee that
[45:31] which is good
[45:32] and let your soul delight in itself and
[45:35] fatness
[45:36] incline your ear and come unto me hear
[45:39] and your soul shall live and i will make
[45:41] an everlasting covenant with you
[45:43] even the short mercies of david you
[45:46] could be seated if you'd like
[45:49] brother branham talked about uh and
[45:51] preached a message on without money
[45:52] without price
[45:54] that's kind of just want to make that
[45:55] title today
[45:58] without money without price a lot of
[45:59] times we talk about
[46:01] the financial part of the about money
[46:03] without price we talk about the
[46:05] monetary value of that and the dollars
[46:07] that we have in our pocket or don't have
[46:09] in our pocket or in our bank accounts or
[46:11] uh invested in something or in in in a
[46:14] home or a car or whatever it is
[46:16] you know there's so much more to it than
[46:18] just understanding or the feeling of
[46:21] of the of what we would call the
[46:22] almighty dollar
[46:24] of the money aspect of it yes it is true
[46:28] that is a huge part of it and and the
[46:30] financial part of it
[46:31] the the money part of it because it all
[46:33] belongs to god anyway
[46:35] it's all his he gives it to us or loans
[46:37] it to us or
[46:38] helps us that we would be good stewards
[46:40] of his money but right
[46:42] a lot of this has to do too with with uh
[46:45] the things that we do in our lives and
[46:47] the things that we do
[46:48] uh with our time now look at this
[46:51] because it it
[46:52] isaiah is talking about here now now
[46:55] come
[46:56] uh and that's always been the call
[46:58] that's always been the cry
[47:00] the cry that jesus gave come come unto
[47:03] me all you that labor and are heavy
[47:05] laden then i will give you rest
[47:07] see because jesus was the rest so if
[47:10] jesus was the rest he was able to give
[47:12] rest
[47:13] but you had to first come unto him right
[47:16] and that's the thing that he's asking
[47:18] now to come unto him
[47:20] and he's saying here isaiah is saying
[47:22] come all ye
[47:23] now see again that goes back to
[47:26] something the lord had put on my heart i
[47:27] guess when we just started this service
[47:29] today come do
[47:30] something make a move see make a step
[47:34] a lift a hand lift a voice do something
[47:36] i see make a move towards the lord and
[47:38] that's what isaiah is saying
[47:40] come ye amen and come ye to that that is
[47:43] of the lord come ye to those things that
[47:45] are of god
[47:46] come ye to inherit eternal life because
[47:49] it is something that you cannot pay for
[47:52] it's something that is bought without
[47:54] money and without price
[47:55] it is something that is priceless you
[47:58] know saints
[47:59] it's a very good thing that it doesn't
[48:01] cost anything
[48:02] because we couldn't afford it right
[48:04] right amen
[48:06] if if eternal salvation cost
[48:09] anything we could not afford it what it
[48:11] cost
[48:12] is jesus christ his life and because it
[48:15] cost him his life
[48:16] he now can stand and say you come
[48:19] because
[48:19] i've already done it i've already paid
[48:21] the work i've already paid the price now
[48:24] you don't have to pay anything amen it's
[48:26] already been done
[48:27] you come and buy without money and
[48:30] without price
[48:31] but now look at the rest of this part is
[48:33] you see so many times people try to fill
[48:35] their lives with so many other things
[48:38] you know we all know about that little
[48:39] empty room brother graham talked about
[48:41] the door and the door and
[48:42] we know that by that empty room and that
[48:44] compartment that place is in
[48:46] that's in the human heart see and and of
[48:49] course there
[48:51] for those that are make believers
[48:53] unbelievers there's always those places
[48:55] especially make believers
[48:56] there's always those places that they
[48:58] they want to let god
[48:59] into their lives but only so much right
[49:02] they only want god to do so much or only
[49:04] have so much
[49:05] influence over their lives and the rest
[49:07] of it they want to do themselves
[49:09] the rest of it they want to have control
[49:11] over see but that's not the kind of
[49:13] person god is looking for
[49:15] he's looking for someone that when he
[49:18] goes into their home
[49:19] when he goes into the rooms of their
[49:21] heart it's fully open and exposed
[49:24] for any place that he wants to go and
[49:26] every one of us should be that way
[49:28] but there's a thirst that god's put in
[49:30] every human being
[49:32] in every soul there's free will uh which
[49:35] was
[49:36] actually initially what i was going to
[49:37] talk about today but we'll do that in a
[49:39] couple weeks
[49:40] there's that free will there's that
[49:42] place there's that thirsting for god
[49:44] every human inherently is born
[49:47] with the desire to worship that's why
[49:50] brother random talked about and you've
[49:51] known
[49:52] out through history that you go to
[49:54] heather countries in places where people
[49:56] didn't know about jesus or didn't know
[49:58] about
[49:58] the almighty god and they're worshiping
[50:01] plants and they're worshiping idols and
[50:03] they're worshiping the sun and they're
[50:04] worshiping the moon and
[50:06] celestial beings because they don't know
[50:09] but there's something
[50:10] in them to worship there's something in
[50:12] them to want to worship
[50:14] something to to bow down into praise and
[50:16] see everybody's got that
[50:18] everybody that that's out here in this
[50:21] world today
[50:22] they're out enjoying entertainment
[50:26] whatever venue that might be
[50:28] they're they're drinking or they're
[50:30] smoking or they're gambling or they're
[50:32] drugs or whatever it is the righteous
[50:34] living and
[50:35] uh whatever it is that they're trying to
[50:38] fill that thirst they're trying to fill
[50:40] that place yeah because that room is in
[50:43] is in every compartment see or or that
[50:46] compartment is in everyone's life
[50:48] that everybody tries to fill but you
[50:50] notice this
[50:51] second verse that he's talking about
[50:54] that isaiah says
[50:55] you can come and what he's offering what
[50:58] jesus is
[50:59] offering is without money and without
[51:01] price
[51:02] in fact your money is no good to him
[51:06] yeah amen it's no good to him god's not
[51:09] looking for that
[51:10] god is looking for you yes looking for
[51:12] your heart
[51:14] and if you give him your heart that
[51:15] means you give him control over
[51:17] every facet of your life every facet of
[51:20] your life now
[51:21] that belongs to him not just say oh god
[51:24] i want you in my life but just only so
[51:26] much
[51:26] you know i give you 90 i give you even
[51:29] 95
[51:30] my that's a high number right i'll give
[51:32] you 95 percent lord but god wants a
[51:34] hundred
[51:34] hundred or none amen he wants
[51:37] vessels that he can work through he
[51:39] wants vessels that he can work he wants
[51:41] to be able to get in that compartment of
[51:43] that life now
[51:44] transcending or going beyond the the
[51:47] finances beyond the money beyond the
[51:50] things that
[51:50] you know that that uh that he's talking
[51:53] about here to come without money without
[51:55] price the second verse he said now
[51:56] wherefore
[51:58] do you spend uh do you spend money for
[52:01] that which is not bread
[52:03] why are you spitting for things that of
[52:05] really of no value
[52:07] are really not of things that are
[52:09] life-sustaining
[52:11] things that are needful that we need
[52:15] because there's things that we need of
[52:16] the lord amen
[52:18] and your labor for that which satisfieth
[52:21] not
[52:22] hearken diligently unto me and eat that
[52:25] which is good and let your soul delight
[52:28] in the fatness well what's he's talking
[52:29] about
[52:30] he's saying protect be partakers
[52:33] of the things in your life that are
[52:35] edifying
[52:37] not just talking about finances but
[52:40] talking about what do you do with your
[52:42] time
[52:43] right what do you do with your life we
[52:46] have an
[52:46] abundance of of wealth we have an
[52:49] abundance
[52:50] of time it's limited both of them are
[52:53] limited
[52:54] but we have plenty of time that god has
[52:57] given us 24 hours in a day
[52:59] amen 24 hours in a day what do we do
[53:02] with it do we spend it for things that
[53:04] aren't
[53:04] edifying do we spend it for things that
[53:07] that don't benefit do we do it for
[53:09] things that are not
[53:10] life-sustaining and life-giving now
[53:13] god's not saying that yeah
[53:15] to be a monk or you know to be on your
[53:17] knees 24 7 or something like that
[53:20] god wants us to enjoy our lives and be
[53:22] happy but
[53:23] understanding that there's a balance to
[53:25] being able to live our lives
[53:27] pleasing to the lord and being able to
[53:29] enjoy
[53:30] ourselves too amen because god wants us
[53:33] to be happy yes
[53:35] because here he says do we labor for
[53:37] those things which satisfy if not well
[53:39] if you're not satisfied
[53:40] the things that you're laboring it in
[53:42] your life you're going to be unhappy
[53:45] and god wants us happy because the
[53:47] happier we are the more prosperous we
[53:50] are
[53:51] the happier we are the harder we work
[53:54] the more we do the closer we draw to him
[53:57] the more we desire more of him see but
[54:01] if
[54:01] but if we're not happy then all the
[54:03] doldrums come that's why
[54:05] you see so many churches today because
[54:07] without the holy ghost what is the
[54:09] church
[54:11] people have rock concerts and they have
[54:13] clowns and they have
[54:14] juggling acts and they have dancers all
[54:17] over the place and waving flags and
[54:19] blowing whistles and
[54:20] they got to have everything under the
[54:22] sun but the gospel right yeah
[54:25] micah is talking yesterday uh about
[54:28] uh these churches that they're getting
[54:30] prepared for palm sunday and in the
[54:32] easter and
[54:33] they had these big rock concerts going
[54:35] on and they had these huge
[54:36] lighted stages and they have big huge
[54:39] screens all over the place and
[54:41] and all the lighting effects and
[54:43] everything and the rock and roll music
[54:44] going on which
[54:45] of course they don't call it rock and
[54:46] roll i do that's
[54:48] i call things the way i see them it's
[54:51] rock and roll music and all going on and
[54:53] they have all these performances and
[54:54] everything
[54:55] and one person said is you know is that
[54:57] really of christ and
[54:58] and another's like well we'll do
[55:00] anything to win a soul i said will you
[55:02] show me in this bible that that's how
[55:04] you win a soul
[55:05] yeah i'll be the first one there right
[55:07] right
[55:08] that's not how you win a soul to christ
[55:11] right
[55:12] amen you win the soul to christ by the
[55:14] gospel
[55:16] you you witness when uh when philip met
[55:20] the eunuch on the road
[55:21] he didn't try to entertain him he
[55:24] expounded to him the word of god
[55:27] and that day that man said there's water
[55:30] what does kennedy
[55:31] praise the lord let's go get baptized
[55:33] and all of a sudden philip's gone
[55:35] right he's there for that time baptized
[55:37] the unit the unit comes to christ
[55:39] and phil is gone and transported from
[55:42] one place to another
[55:43] right that's the gospel amen
[55:46] the gospel gospel's not in entertainment
[55:48] right people are just giving others to
[55:51] a church or to a religion or to an
[55:53] organization they're not getting the
[55:55] christ
[55:56] correct you get them to christ with the
[55:58] gospel not with entertainment
[56:00] so the point then it becomes what is it
[56:02] that we're doing
[56:04] what what are we doing with our time
[56:06] what are we doing with our money what
[56:08] are we doing
[56:09] that's edifying that that is uh that is
[56:13] praising the lord
[56:16] are we happy in those things amen
[56:19] now there's happiness that the world
[56:21] thinks they have
[56:23] and all these things that they do out
[56:25] there they think that makes them happy
[56:27] when their self their flesh maybe sure
[56:30] they might have
[56:31] moments of happiness happiness outside
[56:34] of god is
[56:35] non-profitable happiness
[56:39] must be in the lord our glory our
[56:42] happiness
[56:43] must be in the lord or it's not
[56:45] profitable that's right
[56:46] the flesh will die the flesh will
[56:50] corrode
[56:51] so if the happiness is nothing but
[56:53] superficial then it doesn't amount to
[56:56] anything
[56:57] it doesn't profit that's why isaiah is
[56:59] saying here what is it
[57:01] profit if you're doing this over here
[57:04] and you're doing that over there
[57:05] what is it profiting
[57:08] i i known and and i'm not being critical
[57:11] of anybody or any church
[57:13] but you know i've known people that you
[57:15] know they just
[57:16] they they want to support missionary
[57:18] work so bad they just send money
[57:20] overseas and
[57:21] and they go to help people at least they
[57:24] hope
[57:26] but i never would send anything that i
[57:29] didn't know
[57:30] was going to the use of the lord jesus
[57:33] and helping get souls to christ
[57:36] i wouldn't do it i had people say well
[57:39] you know you should support so-and-so i
[57:41] said i don't know so-and-so
[57:42] right that's right if it's a brother i
[57:44] trust and they say
[57:45] i've been there i've met him i know what
[57:48] he does and i know this goes to the lord
[57:50] i know whatever you sent him is going to
[57:52] go right straight to the gospel you got
[57:54] my support
[57:56] but just to send something and say well
[57:57] somebody sent you an email or somebody
[57:59] sent you a text or a
[58:01] facebook message or something to say
[58:02] well so and so i'm just that the other
[58:04] brother i don't know you
[58:06] i love you i'll pray for you as a as a
[58:09] brother
[58:10] if you are uh if nothing else a human
[58:12] being
[58:13] i'll pray for you right but unless i
[58:16] know who you are and what's going on
[58:18] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna place
[58:20] finances in there
[58:21] because what i i always intend to do is
[58:25] make sure that what it
[58:26] what it does is it goes to the edifying
[58:29] of
[58:30] of god's people that it goes to praise
[58:33] the lord and it edifies god's people
[58:36] so the point is what god has given us
[58:41] is without money and without price
[58:44] the other point is what we do with our
[58:47] lives
[58:48] with our time with our with our finances
[58:53] incline your ear and come unto me
[58:56] here and your soul shall live and i will
[58:58] make an everlasting covenant with you
[59:00] even
[59:01] the sure mercies of david that
[59:04] plan that god had made for us that
[59:07] brings that unification
[59:09] that brings that joining together god
[59:12] and his people together
[59:15] to bring blessing and to bring help
[59:20] and to bring edification and again
[59:22] sometimes
[59:23] we can't just sit and say god move we
[59:26] need to do some moving ourselves
[59:29] and let god move as god moves on us
[59:32] because see there's a way in this world
[59:35] today there's
[59:36] that we know the bible says there's a
[59:37] way that seemeth right to a man
[59:40] but the end of that way is death and
[59:42] people would say oh
[59:43] i don't see anything wrong with this
[59:45] well but does the bible say there's
[59:47] something wrong with that
[59:49] well i don't know well maybe you should
[59:51] find
[59:52] out because that's the most important
[59:54] thing
[59:55] if god's not pleased with it if it's
[59:57] against god's word i don't care if you
[59:59] think it's right
[1:00:00] or not right amen shun the very
[1:00:03] appearance of evil
[1:00:04] is what the bible says even matisse
[1:00:07] talked about that scripture that says if
[1:00:09] the righteous
[1:00:10] scarcely be saved right word of the sin
[1:00:13] and the ungodly
[1:00:14] appear right amen my friend so
[1:00:17] where is it that that puts us at this
[1:00:20] time
[1:00:21] because see we don't belong to ourselves
[1:00:24] we have free will absolutely every one
[1:00:27] of us
[1:00:28] god desired and i don't want to get into
[1:00:31] that part of the message especially as
[1:00:32] short as our time is here but
[1:00:34] we all are born with free will and we
[1:00:37] all have the decision
[1:00:38] we all have choice we all have
[1:00:42] a way that we can decide that we want to
[1:00:46] live
[1:00:46] and the things that we want to do right
[1:00:49] we all have that
[1:00:50] and god wants it that way god doesn't
[1:00:53] want your
[1:00:54] forced worship he wants your free will
[1:00:57] worship all right
[1:00:58] he doesn't want your forced tithes he
[1:01:01] wants your
[1:01:02] free will offering right he doesn't want
[1:01:05] you
[1:01:05] to be forced to raise your hand and to
[1:01:08] praise god
[1:01:09] he doesn't want you to be forced to live
[1:01:11] for him or to do what's right
[1:01:13] he wants you to do it because you love
[1:01:15] him and because you want to do it that's
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:18] free will but now the truth is
[1:01:21] if we belong to him we belong to him
[1:01:23] holy truly
[1:01:25] because we've been bought with a prize
[1:01:28] we don't belong to ourselves
[1:01:30] we belong to him we're just the sheep in
[1:01:32] the shepherd's pasture
[1:01:34] let him lead and guide us the way he'd
[1:01:36] have us to go and i believe truly
[1:01:38] that those that are of god and those
[1:01:40] that have the holy ghost they desire to
[1:01:41] be led of god
[1:01:42] they want god to lead them they want god
[1:01:45] to take control over their lives
[1:01:46] and show them help me lord where where
[1:01:49] do i
[1:01:50] how do i do this and what is this and it
[1:01:52] it's
[1:01:53] it's becoming an all-consuming theme to
[1:01:56] me
[1:01:57] i'll just be perfectly honest it's
[1:01:58] become
[1:02:00] even if i'm not physically doing
[1:02:02] something about it it's on my mind
[1:02:04] all the time i dream about it
[1:02:07] hallelujah finding the next church that
[1:02:11] we're supposed to be in right
[1:02:12] it's becoming just all consuming to me
[1:02:15] i'll just be honest
[1:02:16] makes me understand why the churches
[1:02:18] have deacons and trustees
[1:02:20] and let them take care of that but
[1:02:22] that's okay
[1:02:23] i don't mind what god gives what god
[1:02:26] does
[1:02:27] what uh the purpose of god uh
[1:02:30] we're working on it and god's taking
[1:02:32] care of it right i think the lord's just
[1:02:34] telling me to be patient
[1:02:36] and i will be honest with you i think
[1:02:38] not that i would ever lie to you
[1:02:39] but the i don't know why we say that
[1:02:43] expression
[1:02:44] i'll be honest with you well does that
[1:02:46] mean you've been lying to me this whole
[1:02:47] time now you're going to be honest
[1:02:48] you know i hear people say that all the
[1:02:50] time i shouldn't say that
[1:02:51] but to give you my thought or what the
[1:02:54] lord spoke to me the other day i said
[1:02:56] lord why is this
[1:02:57] taking so long why why is this like this
[1:03:01] and i and i felt in my spirit that the
[1:03:03] lord said so that we
[1:03:04] we to make sure that we appreciate
[1:03:08] the place when god gives us what we're
[1:03:10] supposed to have and where we're
[1:03:11] supposed to have it when we're supposed
[1:03:12] to have it
[1:03:13] that we will truly appreciate the place
[1:03:17] that god give us
[1:03:18] not that we don't appreciate this
[1:03:20] because we do but friend
[1:03:21] the little taste of having our own place
[1:03:23] where we were before and knowing that
[1:03:25] we're going to be a place that god's
[1:03:27] going to provide
[1:03:28] that we're going to be there and settle
[1:03:29] and have our place and no other devils
[1:03:31] no other spirits no other people coming
[1:03:34] and
[1:03:34] doing whatever it's going to be ours
[1:03:37] friend
[1:03:37] and i thought lord then that's okay
[1:03:40] because i i want us to be appreciative
[1:03:43] of what you've
[1:03:44] provided for us and thankful for what
[1:03:47] you give us
[1:03:48] amen right give us this and i'm thankful
[1:03:51] for that
[1:03:52] but what he's going to do and i'm
[1:03:55] looking forward to that
[1:03:56] yes so the other thing is lord help my
[1:03:59] patients
[1:04:00] i'm just i'm trying my best to be
[1:04:01] patient with it but
[1:04:03] it is becoming all-consuming to me
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:08] placing my time and efforts towards
[1:04:11] something to try to help
[1:04:13] god's people and to edify and to
[1:04:16] worship him and to glorify him
[1:04:19] and if we go home before we ever find a
[1:04:21] place even better
[1:04:23] amen amen it'll definitely be that
[1:04:25] tabernacle there on the other side that
[1:04:27] obviously
[1:04:28] could no dollar could buy right amen
[1:04:32] no amount of money could buy where we're
[1:04:34] going amen
[1:04:36] but look at this a couple of scriptures
[1:04:38] just to
[1:04:40] reiterate that uh first corinthians
[1:04:42] chapter six
[1:04:44] chapter six and chapter seven
[1:04:52] first corinthians chapter 6 and chapter
[1:04:54] 7
[1:04:56] verse 19 chapter 6 verse 19 what
[1:05:00] know you not that your body is the
[1:05:02] temple of the holy ghost
[1:05:04] think about that now we all know that
[1:05:06] you know
[1:05:07] we know how these things can slip too
[1:05:10] but recognizing
[1:05:11] your body's the temple of the holy ghost
[1:05:13] it's the place that houses almighty god
[1:05:17] the holy spirit which is in you
[1:05:20] which ye have of god and ye are not your
[1:05:23] own
[1:05:24] if we're christians if we're born again
[1:05:27] holy ghost filled christians we are not
[1:05:30] our
[1:05:31] own we still have our free will
[1:05:34] but our decisions and our pleasures are
[1:05:37] for the lord
[1:05:38] and him alone amen
[1:05:41] you are not your own for ye are bought
[1:05:43] with a price
[1:05:45] therefore glorified god in your body
[1:05:48] and in your spirit which are gods
[1:05:52] so we know now in the believer
[1:05:55] because look at this look at this
[1:05:58] breakdown that paul gives
[1:05:59] to the corinthian church first of all he
[1:06:02] says
[1:06:02] know you not that you are the temple of
[1:06:04] the holy ghost that means
[1:06:06] god has taken resident in your soul
[1:06:10] then he goes beyond the soul and he says
[1:06:13] for you are
[1:06:14] bought with a price therefore glorify
[1:06:17] god now you're
[1:06:18] you're you're housing god in your soul
[1:06:21] the holy spirit in your soul
[1:06:22] now he says now therefore glorify god
[1:06:26] in your body and in your spirit
[1:06:29] that takes care of the entire trial and
[1:06:31] being
[1:06:33] soul body spirit body spirit soul that
[1:06:36] takes care of
[1:06:37] every facet of your being you've been
[1:06:40] purchased
[1:06:41] and you belong to god now glorify god
[1:06:44] in your body and in your spirit
[1:06:47] in your seed taste phil smell here in
[1:06:49] your imagination constitution reason
[1:06:51] memory every bit of it right
[1:06:54] glorify him because you've been bought
[1:06:56] you belong to him
[1:06:57] we do that then god leads us guides us
[1:07:00] and shows us and helps us and
[1:07:02] he's always with us it's good to have
[1:07:04] that confidence and faith
[1:07:06] if anybody's ever witnessed any time
[1:07:08] that god's ever failed i'd like him to
[1:07:10] come forward
[1:07:12] because he doesn't but see that's what
[1:07:13] gives us that confidence
[1:07:15] that's what gives us the the daily i
[1:07:17] don't know i actually
[1:07:18] especially in today's world i don't know
[1:07:20] how people can do it i guess that's why
[1:07:22] they
[1:07:22] they cling so hard to their their
[1:07:25] political party or
[1:07:26] they cling so hard to their social
[1:07:29] groups or they
[1:07:30] they cling so hard to their sports or
[1:07:32] their money or their homes or their
[1:07:34] jobs they clean so hard people become
[1:07:37] workaholics
[1:07:38] because they don't have god right they
[1:07:41] become uh uh
[1:07:42] obsessed people over houses and lands
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:46] and how much more dollars they can make
[1:07:49] because they don't have
[1:07:50] god yeah if you have god then that's
[1:07:53] glorifying the lord
[1:07:55] god provides absolutely god provides
[1:07:59] never his seed been forsaken or
[1:08:03] begging bread right the righteous never
[1:08:05] forsaken the seed baking bread
[1:08:07] because god always takes care takes care
[1:08:10] of his own
[1:08:12] he blesses us but
[1:08:15] people that don't have that see the
[1:08:17] people don't have that
[1:08:18] then then their body spirits they're all
[1:08:21] working on everything else i
[1:08:24] i don't know how people can go through
[1:08:25] life like that
[1:08:27] because every morning i wake up i know
[1:08:29] god is with me
[1:08:31] i know that no matter what happens in
[1:08:33] that day god's gonna take care of me
[1:08:35] god's gonna take care of my family my
[1:08:38] church that's why i pray for you every
[1:08:39] day
[1:08:40] and lift you before the lord because i
[1:08:43] know god is there and i know god's going
[1:08:44] to take care of it
[1:08:45] could you imagine waking up in the
[1:08:47] morning
[1:08:48] and and not having that right
[1:08:52] i mean i i just can't it's been over 30
[1:08:54] years i can't even begin to fathom what
[1:08:56] it's like to wake up in the morning and
[1:08:58] not
[1:08:58] have that in my heart in my spirit to
[1:09:02] know that
[1:09:02] jesus christ god almighty's with me and
[1:09:05] walking and is going to be with me that
[1:09:06] day
[1:09:08] regardless no matter what the sky might
[1:09:11] fall chicken little might
[1:09:12] get it right skyline fall but it don't
[1:09:15] matter because god's still going to take
[1:09:16] care of it
[1:09:17] yes amen god's still going to take care
[1:09:19] of me god's going to take care of my own
[1:09:21] amen so blessed
[1:09:25] just so blessed i don't know how people
[1:09:26] do it but they do it but see we are
[1:09:28] bought with the price you are not your
[1:09:29] own
[1:09:30] you're bought you become the tabernacle
[1:09:33] you become the inhabitants
[1:09:35] of jesus christ and now glorify god in
[1:09:39] your body and your spirit now
[1:09:41] seventh chapter 22nd verse
[1:09:44] for he that is called in the lord being
[1:09:47] a
[1:09:47] servant is the lord's free man likewise
[1:09:51] also he that is called
[1:09:53] being free is christ's servant you
[1:09:56] understand so
[1:09:57] being the servant of god not belonging
[1:09:59] to yourself
[1:10:00] belonging to him makes you a free man
[1:10:03] makes you a free person you're not bound
[1:10:06] to anything in the world out here
[1:10:08] so many people who think they have
[1:10:10] liberty
[1:10:11] are bound to the things that they
[1:10:13] worship and bound to the things that
[1:10:16] motivate them like money and things like
[1:10:18] that they're bound to those things
[1:10:21] you're bound to jesus christ that makes
[1:10:23] you free
[1:10:24] amen yeah and when and whom jesus has
[1:10:27] set free
[1:10:28] is free indeed amen come unto me
[1:10:32] all you that labor and heavy laden i'll
[1:10:34] give you rest
[1:10:35] i'll give you less rest set you free
[1:10:38] from the burdens of the world
[1:10:40] ye are bought with a price amen
[1:10:44] be not ye the servants of men brethren
[1:10:46] let every man wherein he is called
[1:10:48] therein
[1:10:49] abide with god abide in that calling
[1:10:52] that god has called you
[1:10:54] because god you belong to him
[1:10:57] whatever his desire is for your life
[1:10:59] that's what you do
[1:11:01] wherever god desires you to go that's
[1:11:03] where you go
[1:11:05] john told you that story brother branham
[1:11:07] talked about that time he went to
[1:11:09] chicago i think matt and jose maybe it
[1:11:11] set up some services four five six
[1:11:13] services a row whatever it was
[1:11:14] i forgot and um like the second or third
[1:11:18] night
[1:11:20] uh brother branham's preaching is done
[1:11:22] has the altar call and
[1:11:23] and prayer line whatever it was there
[1:11:25] and and uh
[1:11:26] one lady gave her heart to the lord and
[1:11:28] brother brandon went to him afterwards
[1:11:29] said we can shut the meeting down now
[1:11:31] the one person god sent me for just came
[1:11:33] in
[1:11:35] the one person in the city of
[1:11:38] chicago i don't know how many people it
[1:11:40] was in chicago at that time but it had
[1:11:42] to be millions
[1:11:43] yeah i know there's multi millions today
[1:11:45] there had to be millions even back then
[1:11:48] one person in the city of chicago the
[1:11:51] one person god sent me here for just
[1:11:53] came in
[1:11:54] now obviously this could very well and
[1:11:57] probably were more people in chicago it
[1:11:59] just wasn't their time
[1:12:00] it just wasn't god it wasn't their way
[1:12:02] for god to bring them in at that time
[1:12:05] amen so i'm not saying there was only
[1:12:07] one person ever come out of chicago
[1:12:08] that's not what he's saying
[1:12:10] that's not what i'm saying but at that
[1:12:12] time for those meetings that one person
[1:12:14] god see him therefore
[1:12:15] came in he said we shut the meetings
[1:12:17] down now god brought the first knowledge
[1:12:19] that he wanted in here she they just
[1:12:22] came in
[1:12:24] you shut them down i i think they
[1:12:27] probably still had the meetings if i
[1:12:28] could remember right but
[1:12:29] the one person said there not that other
[1:12:31] people weren't helped or blessed or
[1:12:33] whatever but that's
[1:12:34] that's that's the way god works amen
[1:12:37] the great picture that god sees he sees
[1:12:40] it all from the beginning
[1:12:42] and that that picture has to play itself
[1:12:44] out sometimes
[1:12:46] a person you come to the lord jesus
[1:12:49] there might be one
[1:12:51] one singular purpose that god has i mean
[1:12:54] life-altering eternally effective
[1:12:58] point that god wants you to make in your
[1:13:00] life right
[1:13:02] and the rest of your life is you just
[1:13:04] live it the best you can
[1:13:05] live it for god be a good humble godly
[1:13:07] person christian
[1:13:09] raise your children if you have some or
[1:13:11] spouse or whatever it is but
[1:13:13] rest your life you just live for the
[1:13:14] lord yeah but that one thing
[1:13:18] maybe the reason that god brought you
[1:13:19] forth right
[1:13:21] amen right the eternal purposes of god
[1:13:24] can just cannot be measured with human
[1:13:27] understanding
[1:13:28] right they they can't be comprehended
[1:13:31] with human understanding it just you
[1:13:33] just it just doesn't
[1:13:35] to us it just doesn't make sense well
[1:13:38] brother brown
[1:13:38] there's so many more painters thousands
[1:13:40] of people coming every night
[1:13:42] they're receiving the gospel sorry but
[1:13:45] the one person god sent me here for
[1:13:49] amen it just can't be fathomed it can't
[1:13:51] be understood
[1:13:53] but there might be that one thing god
[1:13:55] put you here for
[1:13:56] you remember brother brown uh brother
[1:13:57] green tells us about how brother brown
[1:13:59] told him that god brought
[1:14:00] his dad from over here his mom from over
[1:14:03] here
[1:14:04] and he and and and he bred the two
[1:14:06] together to breed him
[1:14:08] right to bring perry green forth
[1:14:12] amen i i just
[1:14:16] really i i mean i don't know i look at
[1:14:19] my children i love my family so much
[1:14:21] i look at my children i think god sent
[1:14:22] me 2 000 miles from north carolina to
[1:14:24] come meet my wife
[1:14:26] yeah 40th year this year is our 40th
[1:14:29] year i met her
[1:14:30] september 40 years ago in high school at
[1:14:33] that time i told you
[1:14:34] i like your voice thank you that was it
[1:14:38] but that was the beginning it was just
[1:14:39] the beginning 40 years ago
[1:14:42] but who knows why god does what he does
[1:14:45] if he sends somebody from way over here
[1:14:47] and this enough from over here bring
[1:14:49] them together
[1:14:49] just to breed you what is the point that
[1:14:53] god's doing he's taking that picture
[1:14:56] that he saw and he's bringing it to pass
[1:14:58] every bit of it
[1:14:59] i just want to be a part of it i'm
[1:15:02] bought with a price i don't belong to
[1:15:03] myself
[1:15:04] help me lord just to do the part that
[1:15:07] you have me to do lord
[1:15:09] just take my step and move forward and
[1:15:12] and as you move in our lives lord just
[1:15:14] continue to move in our lives
[1:15:16] now let's look at this one scripture i
[1:15:18] want to get to i told you
[1:15:20] in acts chapter 3.
[1:15:26] before time gets away from me here now
[1:15:28] acts chapter three
[1:15:31] we'll just start with verse one
[1:15:34] i refer to this story i guess frequently
[1:15:37] i enjoy it
[1:15:38] i think it's uh i think it's a actual
[1:15:42] epitome of christian life
[1:15:46] and how we should be as christians today
[1:15:49] so many times we we think about these
[1:15:52] things and we think well that was
[1:15:53] brother branham or that was jesus or
[1:15:55] that was in the bible or
[1:15:57] this was that time or this was this time
[1:15:59] no doubt things do change with
[1:16:01] dispensations of time but the one thing
[1:16:03] that doesn't change
[1:16:04] the constant is jesus christ
[1:16:08] and the fact that he doesn't change and
[1:16:10] if he's in you then the things he does
[1:16:12] in you he did in the bible
[1:16:13] right the things he did in the bible he
[1:16:16] does in you
[1:16:17] that doesn't change regardless of time
[1:16:20] seasons people whoever they are they die
[1:16:24] raise up die raise up doesn't matter
[1:16:27] see coach god's still the same he'll
[1:16:30] just use you if you don't do it he
[1:16:31] raised somebody tomorrow
[1:16:32] that will do it just it just keeps going
[1:16:36] on
[1:16:37] that's that's how god does it so if
[1:16:39] there's
[1:16:40] if there's that point that god made for
[1:16:42] us to do
[1:16:44] to live our lives that that place where
[1:16:46] god wants us to be
[1:16:47] see it it is these biblical
[1:16:50] examples that god give us acts chapter 3
[1:16:54] now peter and john went up together into
[1:16:56] the temple at the hour of prayer
[1:16:59] being the ninth hour and a certain man
[1:17:02] laying from his mother's womb was
[1:17:04] carried
[1:17:05] whom they laid daily at the gate of the
[1:17:07] temple which is called beautiful to ask
[1:17:09] alms of them that entered into the
[1:17:11] temple
[1:17:12] who seeing peter and john about to go
[1:17:14] into the temple
[1:17:15] aston alms and peter fasting his eyes
[1:17:18] upon him with john
[1:17:19] said look on us oh boy
[1:17:23] you said that today people wouldn't
[1:17:25] people would crucify you
[1:17:28] look on us and he gave heed unto them
[1:17:30] expecting to receive
[1:17:32] something of them now he received all
[1:17:34] right
[1:17:35] then peter said silver and gold have i
[1:17:38] none
[1:17:38] but such as i have i give thee in the
[1:17:42] name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:17:44] rise up and walk now peter declares to
[1:17:48] them
[1:17:48] i have no silver and gold right now i
[1:17:51] can't declare that too well i could
[1:17:52] declare i don't have any silver or gold
[1:17:54] i got this fake stuff that the
[1:17:55] government now says is good if you spend
[1:17:57] to a store or something
[1:17:58] right it's just it's not backed by
[1:18:00] anything it's just the
[1:18:02] trust of a failed government in our
[1:18:04] country but anyway
[1:18:05] um whoever's watching that
[1:18:08] um just just a piece of paper whatever
[1:18:11] it is today are some coins that uh
[1:18:13] really are almost pretty close to
[1:18:15] useless nowadays
[1:18:17] but anyway uh used to be silver and gold
[1:18:20] so i guess we could still say silver and
[1:18:22] gold have i not but the point that he's
[1:18:24] saying is
[1:18:25] not necessarily that he didn't have
[1:18:27] sustaining value of life what he's
[1:18:29] saying
[1:18:30] is what i have is something far greater
[1:18:33] than what your money can buy right i can
[1:18:36] give you an almond you can eat for a day
[1:18:38] but what god gives you is going to raise
[1:18:40] you up to change your life forever
[1:18:43] not just for a day not just for a season
[1:18:48] what i have i give to you
[1:18:52] peter couldn't give it if he didn't have
[1:18:54] it right you can't give it if you don't
[1:18:56] have it
[1:18:56] but if you have it friends you can give
[1:18:59] it
[1:19:00] we ask prayer for people we have prayer
[1:19:02] requests in our service
[1:19:04] every service basically every service we
[1:19:06] have prayer requests you have things in
[1:19:07] your heart
[1:19:08] you have things that in your sister's
[1:19:10] group that you chat back and forth or
[1:19:12] text back and forth and
[1:19:14] prayer requests and needs and things we
[1:19:16] have a a facebook group page for our
[1:19:19] church and
[1:19:20] things get posted on there and those
[1:19:22] needs come up and we have
[1:19:24] things that come in our lives and our
[1:19:26] friends and our family
[1:19:28] and those are things that we that we
[1:19:30] look to to say oh god
[1:19:31] move well peter didn't look to god and
[1:19:33] say god moved
[1:19:34] peter looked at the man and said i have
[1:19:36] it i'm going to give it to you
[1:19:38] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:19:41] you rise up and walk
[1:19:43] hallelujah now peter just didn't stand
[1:19:46] there and wait for him
[1:19:47] the guy didn't just stand there staring
[1:19:49] at peter peter reached out to the man
[1:19:52] and grabbed him by the hand and picked
[1:19:54] him
[1:19:55] up amen now today
[1:19:59] don't do that because he'll just crumble
[1:20:01] under his feet
[1:20:03] well then what are we doing right
[1:20:06] what is the whole point of this exercise
[1:20:08] just to make
[1:20:10] just to to put on a show
[1:20:13] you either believe it or you don't right
[1:20:15] you have faith you don't you either know
[1:20:17] you've got it or you know you don't
[1:20:20] yeah and if you got it you go and then
[1:20:23] he lifted him up
[1:20:24] his brother around he said get up off of
[1:20:25] that cot get up out of that wheelchair
[1:20:28] move do something so and so brother you
[1:20:32] go over here
[1:20:32] help this person out of that chair
[1:20:36] lift them up look at what the bible says
[1:20:40] seventh first and he took him by the
[1:20:42] right hand
[1:20:43] and lifted him up and immediately
[1:20:46] his feet and ankle bones receive
[1:20:49] strength now the bible doesn't say
[1:20:50] anything about receiving strength while
[1:20:52] he was sitting there
[1:20:54] it said he received strength when peter
[1:20:56] grabbed him
[1:20:57] and pulled him up yeah amen amen when
[1:21:00] there was an
[1:21:01] action when there was a move
[1:21:04] when there was actually flesh
[1:21:07] put to words or words put to flesh
[1:21:10] he picked him up and that's when god
[1:21:13] said okay
[1:21:14] you really believe we moved on the scene
[1:21:16] the street came in the man's feet
[1:21:18] it came in his ankles came in his feet
[1:21:20] and then he walked into the temple with
[1:21:23] with peter and john and all the rest of
[1:21:24] them saw and said he's this the man who
[1:21:26] has been sitting out there crippled all
[1:21:28] this time
[1:21:30] how is it now that he is walking
[1:21:33] amen what a way to preach the gospel
[1:21:37] this man you see before you now whole
[1:21:41] is the man that was setting out baby
[1:21:43] gnomes
[1:21:44] the question then becomes what do people
[1:21:47] want without money without price
[1:21:52] people ask for healing all the time but
[1:21:54] why
[1:21:56] people say i want to be delivered why
[1:21:59] i i i need to be healed why
[1:22:02] why do you want to be delivered why do
[1:22:05] you want to be healed
[1:22:06] what are you going to do with your life
[1:22:08] once you can walk
[1:22:10] now peter didn't say that of course
[1:22:12] jesus did that to the
[1:22:13] pool of bethesda man he says you know
[1:22:15] why
[1:22:17] but peter didn't say that but the truth
[1:22:19] is why
[1:22:21] peter just said what i have i give to
[1:22:23] you and he grabbed him and pulled him up
[1:22:25] and as soon as he made that move and as
[1:22:27] soon as he pulled it
[1:22:28] that strength came in his legs his
[1:22:30] ankles feet but
[1:22:31] why why do people want this people say
[1:22:35] i want to be healed what are you going
[1:22:36] to do with yourself once you're healed
[1:22:38] yes
[1:22:39] what are you going to do with your life
[1:22:41] once strength has came back in your
[1:22:42] ankles if you can walk
[1:22:44] what are you going to do then yeah you
[1:22:47] spent your whole life just sitting there
[1:22:49] begging
[1:22:49] arms now what are you going to do why do
[1:22:52] you want to be delivered
[1:22:53] why do you want to touch from god
[1:22:55] exactly what are you going to do with
[1:22:57] the touch from god
[1:22:59] where are you going to go from here
[1:23:02] without money without price what is it
[1:23:06] that we do with ourselves
[1:23:07] what is it that we do with our time what
[1:23:09] is it that we do with our finances
[1:23:12] amen look what brother adam said here he
[1:23:14] said god said come
[1:23:15] by eternal life without money without
[1:23:18] price
[1:23:19] life to live forever and we turn our
[1:23:22] backs on it
[1:23:23] laugh in his face what are we going to
[1:23:25] do on that day
[1:23:27] what's it going to be if god gives us
[1:23:31] things to do gives us money and makes us
[1:23:33] the richest nation
[1:23:34] under the heavens then god is going to
[1:23:37] ask
[1:23:37] what did we do with it
[1:23:41] what did we do with it why do we spend
[1:23:44] our money for things that satisfy
[1:23:46] not not only to a nation but that'll be
[1:23:49] to individuals from pennies to millions
[1:23:52] of dollars
[1:23:53] will each one be given
[1:23:57] that's what he said well now he said but
[1:23:59] now what are we going to do with it
[1:24:02] god has made us the richest nation on
[1:24:04] the earth he said well what do we do
[1:24:06] with it
[1:24:06] yeah we just pledge another billions of
[1:24:10] dollars to send to a country
[1:24:12] that basically ends up in the hands of
[1:24:16] leaders which basically ends up in the
[1:24:18] hands of cartels
[1:24:21] and the people common person still
[1:24:24] suffering
[1:24:25] yeah what do we do with it oh we'll just
[1:24:28] throw up a little money
[1:24:30] we'll just throw them a little money
[1:24:32] over here and just throw a little money
[1:24:33] over there
[1:24:34] you know we can cheer the whole world's
[1:24:36] eels if we just give enough money to
[1:24:38] enough people
[1:24:39] oh friend if they are so deceived oh
[1:24:41] let's just take every gun away from
[1:24:43] everybody
[1:24:44] that'll solve all the murders
[1:24:48] you take guns away from innocent people
[1:24:50] the only ones that'll have them are the
[1:24:51] crooks
[1:24:51] that's right that's right people say oh
[1:24:54] that was only meant for the second
[1:24:56] amendment is only for a
[1:24:57] well-armed militia in case we got
[1:24:59] attacked
[1:25:00] no that's one reason the biggest reason
[1:25:03] for it was so this government that we
[1:25:05] live under doesn't become a tyranny
[1:25:07] to take over the people
[1:25:11] the founding fathers wanted a way for
[1:25:13] the for the common
[1:25:14] person to be able to defend themselves
[1:25:17] and to stand up for themselves and to
[1:25:20] take their rights and to speak their
[1:25:22] voice
[1:25:24] that's why anyway take it away
[1:25:28] but what did they do with it let's just
[1:25:30] throw money over here let's just throw
[1:25:31] money over there
[1:25:33] what's the point without jesus it's all
[1:25:37] going to hell anyway
[1:25:38] right that's right without jesus
[1:25:42] what is to pull you amen what is it
[1:25:44] going to amount to
[1:25:45] you can throw as much money to it as you
[1:25:47] possibly can
[1:25:49] and what is it going to amount to
[1:25:52] oh my god praise the lord
[1:25:58] from pennies to millions of dollars each
[1:26:00] one of us will give an account
[1:26:03] when men kill one another
[1:26:06] let me scroll move down a little bit now
[1:26:08] then you can see how essential that that
[1:26:10] new birth is
[1:26:12] you must be born again it's got to be
[1:26:15] come to me
[1:26:15] by without money without price you can't
[1:26:18] say i don't have the money
[1:26:20] because you don't need any money
[1:26:23] it's freely given we americans
[1:26:26] we're so prone to paying our own way for
[1:26:29] things and there's nothing wrong with
[1:26:30] that
[1:26:31] that's not his point
[1:26:34] so prone to paying for everything that's
[1:26:37] our slogan
[1:26:38] we paid for things because we got money
[1:26:40] flash our dollar bills and other
[1:26:42] countries and so forth this poor
[1:26:44] walk in you see tourists come in all the
[1:26:46] feathers and fine of course it's not
[1:26:48] like that anymore
[1:26:50] it's not like that anymore you know a
[1:26:52] dollar used to be that
[1:26:53] what used to be the currency that was
[1:26:56] that was
[1:26:56] uh that everybody in the world wanted
[1:27:00] probably still the most commonly spread
[1:27:02] currency in the world but it's not to
[1:27:04] the value that it used to be
[1:27:05] right for there for a long time the euro
[1:27:08] and even the canadian dollar was more
[1:27:10] than the american dollar
[1:27:12] you just keep rolling them out rolling
[1:27:14] them out and they're not worth anything
[1:27:15] anymore
[1:27:18] they're not so valuable amen
[1:27:21] that's right you you've i i've got
[1:27:25] cartons of water sitting in our kitchen
[1:27:28] but if i was in the middle of the mojave
[1:27:30] desert i only had one bottle that one
[1:27:31] bottle is pretty precious
[1:27:34] it's sitting in my kitchen now and it
[1:27:36] just sets there
[1:27:37] it's not so precious it's nice to have
[1:27:40] i'm glad when i need some water i can go
[1:27:42] and just get a bottle of water
[1:27:44] but if you got it in the middle of the
[1:27:45] desert it's pretty precious
[1:27:49] if you just keep getting it over and
[1:27:50] over and over again it doesn't mean
[1:27:52] anything to people
[1:27:54] we'll just give money we'll just pay for
[1:27:55] everything
[1:27:57] that's the solution people have so we
[1:27:59] just
[1:28:00] keep throwing more money at it it'll
[1:28:01] take care of the problem no it doesn't
[1:28:03] in fact a lot of times that just makes
[1:28:05] more problems
[1:28:07] amen just makes more problems i heard i
[1:28:10] read the other day i gotta close here
[1:28:11] but i read the other day that uh some
[1:28:13] man
[1:28:15] killed a whole family of people just to
[1:28:18] take their stimulus checks
[1:28:21] a measly fourteen hundred dollars per
[1:28:23] person he killed the whole family just
[1:28:24] to get their money
[1:28:25] just to get those few stimulus checks oh
[1:28:28] my that's crazy it seemed like the guy
[1:28:32] had a brainstem he just going to bank
[1:28:34] get a couple hundred
[1:28:35] a couple hundred thousand or million or
[1:28:36] something and he was
[1:28:38] killing a whole family yeah i i'm
[1:28:41] assuming this story is true
[1:28:42] kill the whole thing just to get the
[1:28:44] stimulus checked scary friend but it's
[1:28:46] but that's just the way it is what do
[1:28:48] people do with it
[1:28:50] what do we do i close here what do we do
[1:28:56] without money without christ i believe
[1:28:58] we're all christians born again
[1:29:00] we know we've come to christ we know
[1:29:02] what god's given us
[1:29:03] it's free will it's without money it's
[1:29:05] about christ god gave it
[1:29:07] we accept it we thank him for it yeah
[1:29:09] but the daily life that we live and the
[1:29:11] moves that we make towards the lord
[1:29:13] jesus
[1:29:14] those things that we do friend now what
[1:29:16] do they mean
[1:29:18] that we take those steps to the lord we
[1:29:21] come into service here
[1:29:22] every time we have service there's that
[1:29:25] time
[1:29:26] there's a reason now i know some of you
[1:29:29] came in a little later but that i'm not
[1:29:31] criticizing that i'm just saying that's
[1:29:33] why we usually have the doors open a
[1:29:35] half hour early
[1:29:36] i i told the man we rid of the place i
[1:29:39] said let's just have it 10 to 12.
[1:29:42] that way what we'll start church at 10
[1:29:44] 30 and and we can have that 30 minutes
[1:29:47] to come and enter in come and pray
[1:29:52] read our bibles create an atmosphere
[1:29:54] create a spirit do something
[1:29:56] make a move to god whatever it is
[1:29:59] michael start playing and
[1:30:01] then we start singing and all of a
[1:30:03] sudden you know the spirit of god falls
[1:30:05] you at church because god's there
[1:30:08] yeah amen brother uh
[1:30:12] brother johnny green always said we're
[1:30:14] here to have church
[1:30:17] he said many times brother green never
[1:30:19] understood that what do you mean john
[1:30:20] he's here to have church
[1:30:21] here no that's that's not the point it's
[1:30:24] the time of entering in
[1:30:25] brother green i'm saying why don't we
[1:30:27] here we're here we're here at church
[1:30:28] we're having church of course we're
[1:30:29] having church
[1:30:30] but johnny green said let's have church
[1:30:32] time to have church i'm here for church
[1:30:34] that's what it's about though i believe
[1:30:36] that's that's exactly his heart and what
[1:30:38] he means
[1:30:39] is we're entering in we come and we pray
[1:30:42] and we seek god and we let that spirit
[1:30:44] come and take hope
[1:30:45] and and even more so in this place that
[1:30:48] we don't know what goes on in this
[1:30:50] building the rest of the week
[1:30:52] and we come in and we create an
[1:30:53] atmosphere we let god move among us and
[1:30:56] speak to us
[1:30:57] amen sometimes god is just waiting for
[1:31:00] us to make that move
[1:31:02] amen waiting for us to enter in waiting
[1:31:05] for us to say
[1:31:06] something to lift a hand to pray or
[1:31:08] whatever
[1:31:09] let god then come and then and then god
[1:31:12] takes it over
[1:31:13] and it's no more brother zach or
[1:31:16] micah or any of us it's him
[1:31:20] it's him he orchestrates the way he
[1:31:22] wants to be
[1:31:24] amen and that's and i believe that's the
[1:31:26] way we all want it to be

[1:37:22] it's you know you whatever you'd like to
[1:37:25] do
[1:37:25] amen yeah praise the lord thank you
[1:37:28] sister
[1:37:29] praise the lord jesus amen i
[1:37:35] talked about the john yarbrough he
[1:37:37] called the realtor the other place
[1:37:40] uh the pastor of the other place
[1:37:42] supposed to meet with the town of moran
[1:37:44] tomorrow morning at ten o'clock to see
[1:37:47] if they get the power turned on because
[1:37:48] they have to get authorization from the
[1:37:50] town for tdp to turn the power off
[1:37:52] the commercial building needs to get the
[1:37:55] power turned on they can test the air
[1:37:56] conditioner and do the things to
[1:37:58] do so it looks like it's going to be a a
[1:38:01] little while yet before
[1:38:04] things unfold for them to move out
[1:38:07] i'm still concentrating thinking about
[1:38:10] that specific place but all the while i
[1:38:13] am still looking
[1:38:14] i'm still praying i'm still searching
[1:38:17] seeing if there's something i'm missing
[1:38:19] or someplace the lord's got for us
[1:38:21] somewhere
[1:38:22] um and whatever the lord's will is
[1:38:25] that's
[1:38:26] that's what i want nice it'd be really
[1:38:28] nice if we could
[1:38:30] find a little building and that the
[1:38:33] owner wanted to carry or something would
[1:38:34] just buy it
[1:38:35] uh but we'll just uh we'll take what the
[1:38:38] lord gives us
[1:38:40] so as of right now that's where we stand
[1:38:42] with the other building
[1:38:43] it looks like it's going to be a few
[1:38:45] more weeks or so
[1:38:46] you never know i mean things can happen
[1:38:48] fast once
[1:38:50] uh once the others get involved but
[1:38:52] miranda can't even inspect it until the
[1:38:54] power's on so
[1:38:56] and he's got to go get them to approve
[1:38:58] to get the power turned on the power
[1:38:59] gets turned on and miranda has to come
[1:39:01] and inspect it and
[1:39:02] anyway uh that's a whole nother mega
[1:39:04] moral i was going to have a meeting
[1:39:06] actually tomorrow
[1:39:08] uh with miranda to test to check the
[1:39:11] place we're supposed to move into
[1:39:13] to make sure everything's going to be
[1:39:15] okay for us to move in there because i
[1:39:17] was hoping to get all these steps done
[1:39:18] and over with
[1:39:19] so when they move out we can go right in
[1:39:22] and not have to worry about anything
[1:39:23] else to get our
[1:39:24] certificate of occupancy or anything
[1:39:26] like that but i'm learning to
[1:39:29] be patient i hope
[1:39:32] i think i don't have a choice but to be
[1:39:37] patient
[1:39:39] but anyway so we'll just just keep
[1:39:43] praying for us
[1:39:44] and whatever the lord's will is that's
[1:39:46] what we want whatever he wants
[1:39:48] i thought lord i just i'll just claim
[1:39:50] this building for us but
[1:39:51] then the next day i'm like well lord i
[1:39:53] really just i want what you want for us
[1:39:56] so
[1:39:56] not what i think is best but anyway so
