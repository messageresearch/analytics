prayer requests [Music] that anyone sent to me today um got some there buddy I did have one thing I did have one I wanted to mention it's kind of a praise and a prayer request the uh Johnson's null and Shirley are now in India they have made it uh we tried to help them in their missionary as they're going on the trip again this year first time they've been and two years I think two three years three years maybe 2020 anyway uh it's been a while since they've been there because of covet and different things they've had some ailments but they are now in India uh they weren't really planning on going but they the brother Noel said if the Lord provided the finances that they would go and the Lord did so uh thankful for that and just so it's a prayer request that you pray the Lord will just bless them and give them a safe travel and bring them back home safe but you know with Norma giving all the things to say that would be a help and a blessing to the people that he comes across when he's there amen amen so uh it's good it's a praise report they made it safe they're there but please continue to remember them in prayer if you would as well um amen please pray for sister Matisse she had to leave service due to bad coughs or come in just cough a couple times amen but I hate you felt like she had to leave but she had to leave service due to a cough she said she kept feeling like she was choking uh just needs to cough get all that out of her so amen so let's remember that prayer if we would hurt sister Matisse coffin been praying for it she's been dealing with that for a couple weeks now and it's just pray the Lord would bless her and and touch her with that also brother Danny had a request yesterday around 12 30. started my car to get to go to the stores I went to back up my car I noticed my power steering was not working like it should almost like not having it at all I looked it up and it said the cold weather can affect the power of steering unit in prayers that it will go back to normal once these colder temperatures uh desist quit having cold temperatures yes amen so let's remember that in prayer and yes it can affect that normally doesn't depending on the older and type of vehicle but it can it can be a little stiff but usually when the car warms up it should be okay so but we're just praying and believing that it will be okay amen praise the Lord anyone have an unspoken request on your heart even anything else let's just stand to our feet Yes but it is we can go ahead and stand ING with the knee pain and um I have to see my knee surgeon and I just believing the Lord's touch even amen is that the one that's been surgically repaired replaced no that one's all right this one needs to be realized okay yeah I've been told that about the search that he just tells you what he knows yeah and we know a great physician yes that's why I'm standing on that's why I haven't done anything amen praise the Lord Brothers I'm sure this weather doesn't help yeah yeah either way add a lot of rain which is good you know enjoyed having the rain and the weather so but uh brother Dennis yes Lord Jesus we borrow our hearts and heads and Unison of the faith knowing that you're mindful of all of our needs and Lord I was reading this morning and judges how all the Miracles you did for the children of Israel and only two crossed over and the children that were raised along the Wilderness journey and yet Lord one generation that came after that forgot all the Miracles you have done in the wilderness yes and how you are proven that you're a living God Amen Lord I can recall now that it's been over 57 years that you took your Prophet that you sent to us to turn our hearts back to the faith of our forefathers yes and Lord how we have gotten lackadaisical complacent when it comes to serving you we have taken your your truth your miracles for granted that some have gotten back into the world and claimed himself to be Believers identifying with the world with makeup and and unbelief and listening to the wrong music and and and just getting involved with the wrong type of people then we wonder why you haven't come and Lord speak to our hearts in the likeness of this hour yeah we can check ourselves over and over by that you urum summon that you have given us for this day which is so a real word for the hour yes Lord if it doesn't light up father may we repent and get right with your word yes live with you father Yes because there are requests that are very important that are needy this morning there's some that need a healing touch father we know oh what what can hinder any of our prayers it's unbelief sin Lord may we repent of it and put it under your blood may you cleanse us from all our sins as we come boldly asking that you'll come and see and touch each and every one that needs a healing touch Granite but he's with her cop has been gone for weeks father may you deliver her it's only from that condition and all the other ones that need a healing touch you know what they're asking you know what they have need of for you are truly our great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and within your stripes we are healed thank you and my brother Danny with his car father you we know that you you're a miracle working Amen in any circumstance that comes up in our Lives May help him with his car problems father and Lord all the hands that were raised Lord touch each and every one Lord may your healing virtue Waters Flow father may you give him their hearts desires yes may you speak to our hearts Lord I I heard your prophecy say one time Luis Eskimos in Canada walked in two feet of snow and snow with snow chews going to a meeting there were there and now two hours early then they were there to read hear from you to receive a blessing from you Lord how much more we that been blessed with all the nice vehicles that you have given us all the nice um clothes you have given us all the blessings you have given us we are without excuses yes thanks to our hearts you want that extra mile yes how much more shall we go that tomorrow to show you you are number one we want to serve you we want to stand on your word we want to stand on your promises we want to take you at your word we know you cannot fail us what you said uh your promises I heard one minister at this week saying there's always over 6 000 promises and Lord you keep each and every one as your children stand for and ask for whatever they have needed amen Lord bless our pastor as he brings forth your word you use them to speak to our heart and may our hearts be open to receive it in this late hour knowing that you're coming is knocking at the door open your name is praying in the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen is the Lord you could be seated if you lied amen praise the Lord Micah has a something special for us today so we'll pray for him and then God bless you this I was on my heart since brother Pat had opened that another way he did with it so I wanted to sing it it's uh I don't have it in the computer but it's 135 of the songbook y'all feel free to sing along foreign [Music] [Music] then he sings my soul my savior how great thou art yes [Music] savior God [Music] and foreign [Music] [Music] How Great Thou Art [Music] that God is [Music] be very Hallelujah yes to take away

praying praise the Lord amen be so good to us thank you Lord what did we do to ever deserve it Saints amen amen let's stand to our feet if we're good amen go ahead and change throughout the service now amen he is so great just to think about it amen what a mighty God we serve yes thank you amen God bless you today now we'll go uh turn into the scripture now to Genesis chapter one try to pick up where we left off last week um we're willing with the Lord's help Genesis chapter 1 verse one new beginning part 16 amen is what we're on today uh I felt like as I went through it last week I I almost felt like in my condition and feeling the way I did I almost just didn't do justice but when I started listening and looking um uh I believe what the Lord wanted to have said last week was said so um with hopefully with that with leaving behind some certain specific issues that would involve the books the book The Book of Life limbs book of life together that just the highlights that we hit um that it will move on past that so we're going to go to Revelation 21 after this uh after Genesis but we're gonna go beyond the white Throne judgment today so stress the Lord bless us and speak to us through it now and help us to get a little clear understanding of some of the things of the scripture here today amen before we read the word now Lord let's just power his forward prayer if we could Precious Jesus father it's certainly privileged to be here again today we thank you so much Lord for the time and for the energy and for health and strength and life and thank you for this place you've given us Lord thank you for these people that have come those who may be streaming today Father God would just give you glory and praise for Lord without you none of this would be possible yes yes none of it would be worth it uh what would be the point of coming here if you're not here Lord to meet with us Lord it just be another social Gathering which we could do anywhere we go to a restaurant or some other place to have a social Gathering but we didn't come here for that Lord we didn't come to hear come here to see who's here we didn't come here to see what we're all wearing or uh what the circumstances might be we we come to meet with you Lord yes we come to hear from you yes we come to feel your presence to know you once again real Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we come with our cups empty expecting you to fill them today Lord and through the praise and worship father I pray God believing that you were uh pleased Lord with with our worship God and received it unto yourself as a sweet smelling savior here Lord to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think I pray you anoint speaker in here and now God alike that Lord whatever is is is to be accomplished in this service that you would accomplish it father Yes for it'll not return void the word never returns void but it will accomplish what you sent it forth for Lord and I just pray that we just give ourselves in your hands and completely obedience Lord and deliverance that Lord you would have the preeminence now we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and praise for all that is said and done father we commit it to you Lord now and all that is therein in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 again we'll read in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void darkness is upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water amen and you can be seated as you if you'd like and again as I said we're going to go over to Revelation uh gone through we spent quite a bit of time on Revelation 20. um 19 and 20 we're going to go into Revelation 21 today Revelation 21 is the beginning of that time as we know of as the new Heaven and the new Earth uh judgment's over white Throne judgment is over um God has set aside his children and those who were found worthy through their works and given given uh washed their robes in the blood of Christ those he set up on his right hand and the rest have uh have been banished to the Lake of Fire right Heaven has been pure Earth uh well we'll just get to this part right now as we're gonna read uh Earth is being purified amen at this point purification of the Earth is a little unclear uh to me through the scripture and in the things that brother random said as to exactly the time of the purification of the earth whether it's before the white Throne judgment or after the white Throne judgment uh I believe as I said before that I tend to believe it's before uh uh but not absolutely sure about that but as you know at the end of uh Gog and Magog when God brings the fire and brimstone and destroys them as we could see would be to me uh uh a time that would ignite that that fire that is to purify the herb right amen remember the Earth has gone through its water baptism uh justification has gone through its bloody baptism uh sanctification when Jesus dropped his the chemistry of his blood upon this Earth that's going to go through a fiery baptism the Earth gets redeemed in the exact same way that we do uh there's justification sanctification holy spirit amen the the Earth which we are a part of our bodies are a part of goes through the same process the water baptism the sanctification of the blood on the earth and now a fiery baptism so to me it seems like that that period of time is more or less the time that um uh that it would be a complete wholesale burnover of the earth now is it before or after is really to me inconsequential though uh although I guess if we read the Bible and and we desire to uh look at it in the in the way that we see it through the scripture and the scripture the way it describes things and how events are going to unfold we kind of all have our ideas of how it's going to happen and how it's going to unfold and and what the Lord's going to do and when he's going to do it and things like that it's it's kind of like the earthquake it's going to sink California uh you know brother Branham never says if it's before the Rapture after the Rapture uh there's nothing in the prophecy that says that there's nothing that he says afterwards I have a lot of people that I've heard say it's got to be before and I've heard a lot of people say it's got to be after and everybody has their reasons and their uh their proofs that they have to to substantiate their belief but we bottom line is we don't know right but also the bottom line is it's really inconsequential the fact is it's going to happen yes amen I kind of tend to believe it's sort of going to be simultaneous with that great earthquake and uh the dead in Christ shall rise first and uh we all caught up together to meet the Lord in the air and there's going to be a lot of chaos at that period of time and things going on so but again I guess we all kind of have our things that we said in the scripture and say well I believe it's going to be this way well that's fine I'm not going to argue about that with you uh it very well could be this is what I believe and this is what I think so uh and and all that is fine one way or the other but we've gone through the white Throne judgment uh to me we're at that point where the new Heaven and the Earth the new Earth is to be set up so let's read this Revelation chapter 20 where where we are ushering in uh I'll probably read something a little bit later but this crossover now uh ushers us into a to the to the point of Eternity yeah yeah this ushers in the point of this study all the way through the new beginning that began this is now this is what we were heading for the whole time when we started out in the Garden of Eden in Genesis what's this this new beginning that we call a beginning is the ushering in this time now now we've had time elements all up to this period of time even after the Rapture even after uh uh the Millennium and Gog and Magog is is unfolding Through Time elements but this now is the beginning of Eternity eternity um amen well I wasn't going to do it but let me let me do it um I was going to say this for next week let me just show you something so many of you have probably seen this or heard this and I've tried to describe it and use uh different things that would maybe describe it a little bit better and I probably should have taken this off earlier because this doesn't go off very easily but I don't need a lot of room here to show you what I'm talking about the blending in is kind of the verbiage that I like to use yes the blending in back into eternity because remember when we when when it started out we started out in eternity when Adam and Eve started out they started out in eternity correct well when the fall happened uh eternity is just like a circle there's no beginning and no ending to it obviously as I drew it here you can point to a beginning and ending but and I usually like to take my ring off but my ring doesn't come off very easily anymore so but if you take your ring if you have a ring across the top of that ring you could run until you just starve to death or die or whatever because there's no beginning and ending to it see and that's what eternity is eternity never had a beginning never has an ending amen that's God God never had a beginning I I sometimes shudder to teach a lot on that because it blows my mind when I try to think about it it drives me crazy to think of where because even when I was a little kid but even when I was Joel's age I was asking my dad uh where did God begin where did God come from because see in our little finite P brains everything has to have come from something the way we think about it normally naturally carnally in our human thinking everything had to come from something but God didn't he just always was he's just a self-existing Elohim he never began and he never ends that's eternity there's no beginning and no ending to it but when God created man he created man in a uh in a uh here but in eternity in God's perfect will God's perfect will is eternity God's permissive will is time now when man fell it brought into here into eternity a little blip of time that that came off and Blended from eternity into time That's How Time began with the Fall In the Garden of Eden it Blended and ushered in a Time see and people think there's this great definitive separation between one and the next and there really isn't it's just a matter of uh it's just a matter in God's Mind of a blending in it just Blends in from one to the next and just as it blended into time and we've been in time this whole time out here just as we Blended from eternity into time just from the simple fall in the Garden of Eden we blend right back in to Eternity again right amen it's not necessarily to think some great shaking or event now I know we've got the white Throne judgment and after that it begins and blends back into this eternity again but it's not uh something to say there's this uh bam that's it it just Blends from time right from the white Throne judgment it just Blends right from that time element and goes right back into eternity again yes amen so he Blended out of God much perfect will in eternity out into a time element where uh there was Fallen man in sin and and all the things we see in the world today in this time element Satan took control of the earth and all the things that were therein of the earth through this time of and he's been in control of it this whole time Satan is still in control of it through this whole time element but when Satan loses his grip when Satan has to loose his grip off of this Earth and all the things that entered in through this time element when God when Satan loses his grip off of this kind of hard to put it where everybody can see it now when when Satan loses his grip off of this he's thrown into the Lake of Fire we blend back into eternity again yes yes see him into the place that at this time after the white Throne judgment everybody is in their glorified condition amen no longer time bodies now this time body that we have that's a part of the earth will be glorified amen not another body but it will be in a glorified condition that's why brother Branham tells us that our loved ones has gone on I remember when my dad passed away I found a picture of my dad when he was about 18 years old 19 years old and I put it on his casket and everybody come by and look at my dad I said that's the carcass my dad was housed in but this is what he looks like now amen because he's going back we go back to that young man young woman in a glorified condition in the way that it was supposed to be to start with in the way that our bodies that we are in now were supposed to be in a word body in a spoken word body The Way We were supposed to be from the beginning is how we will be after we leave here in a glorified condition so everyone at that time remember those that have rejected it are in the Lake of Fire and all we have are those God's bride those who be granted life 144 000 that blends back into eternity to give eternity there is no more time element involved there are no more time bodies to be stuck in like we are now there's no more time involved at all and that and this permissive will when Satan is cast in the lake afar has to lose his grip off of everything that he had control over through this whole time period he'll have to let go of it Blends back into eternity again right amen that is the beginning here that we are looking at Revelation 21 is the blending back in from time back into eternity we've had this how many thousands of years now from the time that it fell in sin into time and we're about to thanks with a short period of time are going to be blending right back into eternity where everything is right again everything is perfect everything's the way God thought it made it predestined in his mind uh everything about it will be exactly according to his his word and will amen now we can't we can't just box God up into the pages of this Bible God is greater and more expansive and and that's not even good enough words to describe it then what this book can hold right than what this book can contain God is so far more greater uh than what this book can hold but God gave us this so that we as humans in this time element can get a can just get a little glimpse a little grasp of who the Eternal Almighty omnipotent really is this is just a small snippet so when you look at this obviously God has to obey his word and fulfill all this work once this word becomes fulfilled see since we're getting at the end here Revelations is the end of the Bible there's only 22 chapters and we're starting on chapter 21. so this is the end of that but it's not the end of God Amen it's not the end of you it's just a it's just an unfolding back into where we're supposed to be to begin with amen that God had now so keep that in mind Revelation 21 we've now gotten to that new beginning we've now gotten to that place of Eternity again where where time has had to give way Satan has had to let loose of his script as God and his children enter into this new day this new beginning praise the Lord Revelation 21 now let's read it we'll just read the first couple of verses today it's probably all I'll get to today and I saw a new Heaven now Luke John this is the vision that God of course is giving to John and John describes it this way he said and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth amen and we'll get to that a little bit I'll have to I'll have to I thought about it yesterday and I spent some time in reflection and prayer and there was no other way but to go back and reiterate some things that we've said in the past in this series so I hope it doesn't become redundant to you if it does please forgive me but to to get us to this point uh I found it necessary so just to let you know of that ahead of time John saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adored for her husband now there's quite a lot that's involved just in the first couple of chapters our first couple of verses but let's go back to this new Heaven and this new Earth and the passing away of the old Earth and the old Heavens so let's go back over as we have before II Peter chapter 3. amen because there's this Earth has to be prepared it's always been a point of contention in Christendom as to the placement of these events a millennium a white Throne judgment uh the this Revelation 21 this new city the New Jerusalem uh to understand at a lot of uh Christian organizations religious believe that this is just something that will be uh out somewhere they don't recognize that it's that this is going to be set up right here on this Earth on this place that God created for you and me God is has ended at this point of the scripture has ended all the sin all the unbelief all the doubt all the gray hair all the eyeglasses all the old age all the Death all the sickness all the police all the ambulance all of any of that is done away with amen God has conquered every bit of it that is all done finished now God is restoring back what he intended for it to be when he created Adam in the Garden of Eden restoring back that's the that that's the premise the whole premise of this new beginning is the restoring back of what was lost in the Garden of Eden re bringing back a restored Eden to the place that it was supposed to be when God first said let there be as we read every single time we started a a a a part of this series in the beginning God created the Heaven Earth back to that point God is restoring back now bringing it back to that place so if he's going to do that where is he going to do it he's going to do it right here right right here on this Earth in this place that God created he created it for you and I to live on for us to enjoy for it to be a part of of his creation and us together with body life and animal life and human life existing coexisting together in in unity Harmony perfection restoring a restored Eden is where he's talking about people fussing fighting going about uh whether we're going back to Pentecost or uh or not to go back to Pentecost things like that that's always the verbiage they want to throw out friend I'm not concerned about going back or not going back to Pentecost my concern is getting to the place that we reach this restored Eden yes that's what I'm looking for this place of Eternity this new hope this new Heaven and new earth that's what I'm looking for you can have your Pentecost gets the spirit that's that's fine all that's part of the scripture absolutely but my goal of mine is not to go back when 120 was an upper room but my goal in AIM is to go back into the mind of God where he designed it to be and the way it was supposed to be in his mind before this world was ever formed amen amen now Revel uh II Peter uh chapter three we got a new Heaven now continue to keep in your mind the verbiage that we just read that Peter uh that uh John the Revelator gave us he saw God showed him a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away now most of you know uh of course if you know the message and have heard me talk about it several times you recognize that when you get into the scripture and you and you see the truth of what pass away means it doesn't mean a complete annihilation this passing away does not mean that the Earth is going to be completely annihilated yes as we've talked about it's going to be drastically changed it's going to be brought back onto its perfect axis like it was the beginning it was still supposed to be the whole frame of it outside what we just read what what was the last thing there in first and the first verse that John saw he or did not see he saw no seed there was no more seat well just to be just to see this Earth as we see it now which is uh anybody correct me if I'm wrong but 70 plus percent water that there's going to be no more C right well that tells you right there that that the changing of this ball of dirt this big rock is going to be quite drastic because first of all there's no more seed right amen so that tells you there amen that's going to be a big change but now look second Peter chapter three let's start with verse one foreign this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days offers walking after their own lusts we've gone through that and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation and that is not true but that's what the scoffer says believe for this they willingly are ignorant of now remember we've gone through that being deceived or willingly ignorant willfully ignorant there's those that are willfully ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water but John saw an Earth with no water no more seed whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished amen perished now now I want you to notice something here when it when it talks about when it talks about the word world perished here means to destroy or to be lost or to loose uh to be changed if you will uh not entirely abolished or uh completely annihilated but destroyed or perished to the point that it's uh it's changed it's changed its form amen now with it changing its form this perish when it talks about uh uh the the the whole the old Heaven and Earth perishing it it's talking about that that Earth that changed from what it was to what it will be and the word world here does not mean and you can look it up and see but this world here does not mean this the physical Earth the Greek on this means Cosmos so when you look up whereby the world that was being overflowed by water the world that was is not talking about this ball of dirt it's talking about the cosmos or the world order everything about the Earth that was in the Earth on the earth at the time not the actual structure of the Earth itself when it says World here it means the the the science and the medicine and the politics and the sin and and the degradation it's talking about the spirit it's talking about the germs it's talking about the diseases it's talking about the world order amen just like is very prominent and people's verbiage today they want to talk about a one world order well that's what they're talking about the order the structure of the world not the not the chemistry of the earth not the actual uh uh uh makeup of the Earth itself but the world order is what perished it's understand so everybody and all the things that were there all the animals uh all the things of the Earth were changed by that perishing were loosed but it was simply the world order amen the world ordered so when it says whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished that means the old Andalusian World ceased to exist only ones that came through there were the eight that were on the arm the animals and and those but the only human life were Noah his wife his sons and their wives That's the only ones that came out of the Andalusian world into the next new beginning the next World the the uh uh the the world order perished okay but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men and that's destruction Perdition is just the destruction of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord is a thousand years a thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word not willing to any should perish but that all should come to repentance the sad part about that is the more grace it seems and the more time it seems that God gives to humanity the worse humanity is instead of taking that time taking that extra Grace taking that extra time that God's given for repentance people are taking it and stopping at it instead right they're not taking advantage of the of the long-suffering of God they're just seemingly getting worse and I say seemingly just to be polite we all know it is and it's going to be but yet God if there's just one soul and all of that you think oh it's just getting worse it's getting worse yes it is but if there's just one Soul that's worth 10 million World Saints comes in during God's long-suffering or or time because I I still don't understand why we're still here uh that's God's plan that's God's doing all I can tell you is he is long-suffering to us in in his will that none would perish knowing that it's getting worse but if there's just one that comes out of it it's just one soul that comes out of the long suffering is worth it it's worth it for us to continue to dwell here while God is doing his work amen that's why it's up to us to do our jobs if there's one person somebody can witness to somebody you can talk to amen that's what we do praise the Lord it's amazing I'm gonna say this it's amazing what a difference you can make in somebody's life just by projecting Christ to them you don't have to talk to them you don't have to witness to them you don't have to uh preach to them all you have to do is live a life in front of those people and they'll see Christ yes amen whether they want to or not whether it has a good effect on them or not they will see Christ and most of the time in my experience in my belief and you may call me naive but I believe it how it happens for the better yes your presence your mere presence in in people's lives will make them better yeah amen doesn't happen all the time I know sometimes I've experienced the other it makes them worse but a lot of times it'll make that person better amen it'll make that person better I've just experienced that on on the job uh just I haven't preached anybody talked to people from time about the Lord or uh things like that but I Don't Preach to anybody but my life does just be who you are amen and people start recognizing it and seeing that you know there's some value to it amen yeah there's some good to this I may not have just I may not have agreed with that person I may not have even liked him at first at first most of the time people look at a Christian especially ones that try to live the word like we do and think you're a holier than thou or something and they shun you to start with but when they get to know you and recognize you as a person amen not some Celestial being floating around somewhere you're a human you're a person yes it makes a difference it does more than probably we'll ever recognize but it makes a difference just projecting Christ to somebody amen it makes a difference it doesn't it'll change their life amen you're changing lives and don't realize it sometimes but it's the truth yes amen let's continue on the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slightness is long-suffering to us word not willing to any should perish but all should come to repentance is just one Soul Thing that'd be great amen maybe more amen but if it's just one but the day of the Lord look now the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night we know that in the which the heaven shall pass away the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the and then listen to what's going to happen Heaven shall pass away again it's the same word we look at pass away it's the same word it's not an Annihilation it's a changing it's a loosing from one form to another okay Heaven shall change uh shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat that is a hot hotter than hot amen a fervent heat is a burning passionate hotter than hot can be than we could think you think white hot has no comparison to this fervent Heat elements will melt with fervent heat the Earth also look now and the works the works now recognize what we said a minute ago about the world Cosmos what is the world Cosmos it's the world order or the works that are therein the worst happening on the Earth the spirits the denominations the government the politics the sin covid germs diseases the Wows of the devil all of that the works what's going to happen the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up shall be burned pass away change to all the germs the worst will be done away with this Earth will undergo a comfort uh uh uh a change amen a change from one form to another it's God preparing it when when John saw it he saw it after this had taken place again another reason maybe why I think it will probably be before the white Throne judgment after the white Throne judgment we just go back into eternity right amen and and God sets up this city that we go live in so but when John saw it when God showed it to John he saw it in its new condition he saw it in its perfected condition if you will he saw it as God did after what Peter is telling us here after the part that heavens and earth pass away that all the elements and The Works therein burn up sing then now that all uh all these things shall be dissolved what men are a person ought ye to be an all-holy conversation and godliness amen if that doesn't shake us to our very core what is it going to take amen that's right amen looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat dissolves and melt with fervent Heat now I want to show you something we had the perished a minute ago amen this is the pass away foreign I had a couple things I wanted to show to you because when you start breaking it down and looking it makes a big difference now when it talks about dissolving look again 12 first looking forward Hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat this dissolved look yes works with the passing away means Greek I can't it's l-u-o whatever that however you pronounce that those with the same passing away as as Matthew 24 35 when Jesus said heavens and earth will what pass away but my word shall never pass away or change from one form to another Heaven and Earth will change from one form to another but my word cannot change am I amen him that word being that the word is Christ it can't change because it's gone it's Eternal anything is eternal as God God's the only thing that's the only one that's Eternal cannot change cannot get better can I have a better thought can I have a better idea it cannot be uh anything wrong with his thoughts everything is perfect in God cannot change dissolved same now is to break or to unloose again what did we talk about losing or or taking away too loose look to lose any person or anything tied or fastened tight or fastened let me read you this quote so many of these things go together Saint so please bear with me but in Future Hope brother random talks about this passing away look here for a second the Greek word passed away he said how this world how's this world going to pass away and we're going to live on it remember we're going to live here here on this Earth that God created remember this is a restored Eden we're talking about this isn't something floating out in the stratosphere somewhere this is here amen this is here how is it going to pass away we're going to live on it notice he said he spelled it out p-a-r-e-r-e-c-h-o-m-i-a uh I don't know how to pronounce it he didn't know how anyway now that way inspiration strikes me something goes and writes it down heavens and earth will pass away now the word means passing from one form to another passing from one form to another remember it falls in the same category or lines with dissolved where it means to melt or too loose to let grip to let hold of remember what Satan's going to have to do Satan is going to lose his grip on this Earth he's going to lose his grip on everything that he's had control over for all these thousands of years he will lose his grip over it he will for a short period of time a thousand years during the Millennium but then he's loose to give but what's him the prophet the Beast are cast into the Lake of Fire his grip over all of this is loosed he has to take his dirty hands off of it once and for all amen praise the Lord let me go down a little bit Jesus used the same word Matthew 19 he's talking about Matthew 19. uh now he said you've set in my father's Kingdom regenerated changed we use the same word as he used the word when he said to the cult remember when the the the Palm Sunday was coming and he told his disciples go and you'll find a cult of this tide he said loose him and bring him to me it's the scripture brother Brown was referring to he said to the coal said loose the cold and let him go lose him let him go same word here the same thing the resurrection of Lazarus loose him he was bound Lazarus was in grave clothes when he came forth he proclaimed to those around him loose him and let him go free praise the Lord you see that's that same uh word that he's telling us here he's been tied let him go what does it mean the Earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it will be loose from politics it will be loose from the nominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of God to be established here on this Earth again as long as it's in Satan's hands it is politics Satan's the ruler of the earth he owns it it belongs to him they can fight back and forth they can scream elephant or donkey they can yell Democrat Republican independent all they want they can change parties all they want but every bit of it is of the devil and is rotten to the core yeah amen every bit of it I don't care who's in office I don't care who's not in office I don't care who's speaker I don't care who's this that and the other amen and I say I don't care I do care but the bottom line is none of it matters because every bit of it's corrupt it's all of the devil the whole system's corrupt yeah yeah the whole system is corrupt it's of the devil amen but Satan is going to have to lose his grip off of that as long as it belongs in Satan's hands and it still does politics Satan the ruler of this Earth owns it it belongs to him but Christ has redeemed it and now is the time that we're reading that God takes control over the property that his son redeemed back amen praise the Lord dripped his blood upon it and redeemed it back Satan still a squatter he still has control over it but he's loosed his grip but now when when when this takes place when this passing away unfolds his grip will come be completely gone yes that's why we blend right back from the time back into eternity again because Satan's grip has been loosed and it has and has Blended right back again from time back into eternity again the only way it Blended out of Eternity because of Satan because of sin in the Garden of Eden amen it Blends right back into eternity when he is done away with and he has no more grip over it praise the Lord so what does that tell you about time amen look now one time it was his property but not now one time he talked about that little woman was his property look at this now one time that little woman was his property but not now one time I was his property but no more it was a day when you were his property and I'd say that word was depending on your faith but was his property but no more amen right I don't belong to him anymore I'm no longer his property he's had to loose me and set me free Amen to Worship the Lord he come to loose the grip of it he loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my life upon your life and now we are not his have you often heard me say in prayer take your hands off of God's Property amen listen now have faith to claim your own that's your rights amen have the faith to claim them they belong to you take your hands off of him take your hands off of her see faith will do it cause the grip of Satan to be loosed because it no longer belongs to him by the authority of God's word and you in his life Satan has to loose his grip off of that now Satan is losing his grip off of all of the earth everything about the Earth let's look at this future home notice here he's talking about Bible students he said when you look at that word I'll just use this to patch it in for you if you will and look at that word there in second Peter 3. he uses the word world as the Greek word says it means Cosmos which means the world order the Earth shall pass away melt the elements with fervent heat see doesn't mean the Earth the planet is going to pass away but the world Cosmos the politics Center systems sin diseases germs everything that is wrong will pass away done away with elements The Works will melt with fervent heat no wonder John saw a new Heaven and a new Earth no wonder everything that was a part of what this Earth used to contain what even the heavens and the atmospheres the germs diseases the sin and all in the atmosphere devils and demons principalities of the powers of the air will be done away with cast in the Lake of Fire and every bit of it will be annihilated will be cleansed amen the heavens will explode with fervent Heat the politics and all will be done away with Peter said it will melt with fervent heat the works that are there and not the planet The Works therein The Works of man all their politicians in their schemes all their denominations and man-made schemes will all go with it when it burns heavens and earth will pass away with a great noise listen the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases that's in the earth and explode it exactly now I'm saying this because it's bringing us to to a point here and I'm running out of time to make my point but I will uh before we get into the next one there's there's something that this is doing it's simply not just purifying the Earth although that is the utmost importance friends putting the Earth back on his proper axis like it's supposed to be remember everything that everything that is that happened during this time blip is going to be made right amen and and the tilting of this Earth happened during this time blip amen during the flood it will be brought back in its proper place in its proper condition everything will be made right God will make every single thing that was corrupted by Satan right again in his perfect will perfect will perfect will is God's eternity yes permissive Willis when we entered into time yes will be made right all of this is bringing about the Earth of of the explosions and the convulsions of this Earth it's going to is is going to change it and bring about a tremendous cataclysmic event listen now the whole earth will be on fire the gases will ignite the Earth will explode the Bible said and heavens and earth will pass away the great noise such as such an explosion will rock his whole mind he says because it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn everything there is to be done the fire will burn it up purify it what did we say a few Services ago best purifier that we even know or have today is fire amen remember it's not all together just a literal fire but it's a Holy Fire even the H2O the water will explode amen because remember half of water is hydrogen hydrogen and oxygen amen so even the water the hydrogen the H2O will explode no more Seas praise the Lord see it's setting something up no more scenes right okay you know when man receives a fiery baptism there's a lot of noise around amen yes there is they think that's a shame to hear people scream shout like that just wait till this Earth gets her baptism it'll explode the water the H2O and there'll be no more seed this will change the whole surface of the entire Earth shall burst and blow to Pieces all the outside the crust and for hundreds of feet below it it'll just simply be completely demolished not annihilated amen but changed right right amen even to uh as he said hundreds of feet below the crust the atmospheres the gases that's in the earth now where they're finding missiles they can't get through up there the sphere somewhere all kinds of gases they say that'll bust a burst a holy wrath of God will it will will ignite and cleanse the entire surface of the Earth now why why are we why are we talking about this because it's got to bring something it's got to bring something about because in this time element eternity time element we still have what we know of as this planet Earth that we live on bursting exploding I'll make it a little bit better than that later but bursting exploding even to underneath the Earth to where even the gases and think about all the petroleum we pump out even from under the earth now I mean they talk about super volcanoes and all these things friend that's just a drop in the bucket to what's going to happen to this planet right amen and all that under the Earth it's got to do something look here now I know I'm not finished in second Peter but let's go over Revelation I I I'd save this for next service but let me just read this as we'll finish this for today uh I'm sorry that's horrible that's not even a good egg I Must List a good Circle all right that's a little better the Earth I was gonna say this for next time but remember no more C no more C and what was our lesson that we talked about with with with uh with Abraham when Abraham met Melchizedek Abraham was looking for what a city who's looking for a city whose Builder and maker is gone that city is the same one we just read that John said I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God that's the city he was looking for when he went looking he ran into the president the Elohim God the logos that was in Elohim the thought expression of God spoken formed into the person of Melchizedek I say person for lack of better phraseology or terminology unfolding into that low boss down condescending down into a human body that we call Jesus Christ same blow boss same God not a different God just like the books we talked about last week amen unfolding in from one to the other one's the natural birth the other's the spiritual birth but one leading to the other not two books but the one amen he's not two Gods he's one amen but he's unfolding himself in the manifestation of these offices that he sought to declare on the earth what was already declared in the heavens when Melchizedek came and Abraham found him and and he came to him the slaughter of the Kings as Abraham was looking for this city he ran into Melchizedek yes Jesus Christ got himself the city himself amen he ran into him on the literal spot he had communion had fellowship with Melchizedek communion bread water wine on the literal spot where this city will be put will come down where this city will be that we will enjoy we got to talk about the dimensions and all those things yes but the explosion as I get to here that explosion is going to and I've done the dimensions I have a very accurate on a thumb drive somewhere drawing of of the approximate Dimensions very close though I did it uh by scale as close as I could of the Earth and this pyramid-shaped mountain that is going to push up out from the Earth all of this explosion not a very good pyramid Mountain but that's that's approximately what it's going to look like because one time I thought the size of this thing and I thought how is this Earth but when you look at the dimensions of the earth it's absolutely entirely feasible that it just takes up of this mountain as big as it is this pyramid-shaped mouth of this city this place where where this city will set off is going to be easily brought up or pushed up out of this Earth in all the explosions all the changes all the belchings of the Earth from down a hundred feet below will press and push this pyramid-shaped mountain up you say how will that happen how all these mountains out here today how did this mountain over here get to where it's at somebody just dropped some dirt one day and there it is no even science says that these plates come together and it pushes them right straight up you think well this seems impossible no it's not right how is that impossible we see the things we got here today God's not changing right amen is still the same even the explosion everything it's all going to be it's still going to be this Earth that pushes up this pyramid-shaped mountain seeing a lot of people don't don't grasp or understand that but let's let me read this real quick let me make sure I got my uh scriptures that I had here I wanted to get correct 15 and 16. same Revelation 21 and he that talked with me had a golden Reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof and the city lieth Foursquare amen Foursquare and we'll get to that later and the length is as large as the breath and he measured the city with the Reed 12 000 furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal the link and the breadth and the height of it are equal now going back to most a lot of people I would say most in the Christian belief still believe and will teach that this is a cube that this is acute but it cannot be acute and we'll talk about why later but there is another shape that can meet these dimensions of four square and exactly the same on every side and that is a pyramid a pyramid as such that goes up to the top that's the same in every side amen now if the I'll just say this real quick if the lamb is to be the light obviously a perfect shape pyramid is going to be more earthy than that like our mountains out here it's not going to be straight up um it is going to be more mountain-ish this pyramid-shaped mountain that's going to be but if it is a cube and the lamb is the light of that City how is the how is the Lamb going to light up the whole city if it's a cube there's going to be sides of it that couldn't see the light right at all but if the lamb is the light and it's and he is up here it can light down over all sides of this pyramid from the top to the bottom right the whole the entire city will be illuminated continuously by the lamb being the light amen amen disappeared so all this shaking and changing yes it is to purify it is to get rid of all the sin it is to get rid of all the destruction and the diseases and the and the sin the politics it is to do all that and get rid of all that but it's also bouncing underneath to get to to make to get rid of the seas because there'll be no more seed because remember this is uh as it said the uh 140 uh four cubits it's 1500 Miles Square it's 1500 miles this way and 1500 miles this way 1500 miles up because it's it's a perfect Dimension remember 1500 miles so if it's that and it's over in Palestine well where are you going to have 1500 feet by 1500 feet anywhere that's not going to be interrupted by water so there has to be no more C for this thing to push up to be at a place to where God can bring his holy city down right amen so as we go back I know I've thrown a lot out there that I'm going to have to solidify later uh but please bear with me but let's go back to the first first saw new Heaven and new earth I hope what we've talked about here is kind of explained that amen it's not that God started over again with Genesis 1. nope just took what was here and purified it changed it verse heaven and first Earth were passed away or changed from one form to another there is no mercy or loosed loosed amen no more seeing and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as I brought a door for her husband coming down and setting Upon This Mountain this city comes and sits the city comes and sits right right down on this mountain that God had prepared for us amen so many of the things of this that I just love to get into that we will later but let me leave you with this this Mount this city this mountain this pyramid remember is 1500 miles High the same as it is 1500 miles wide it has to be squared has to be a perfect Dimension or or the Q people are right amen so it has to be 1500 wide has to be 1500 long has to be 1500 times you ever thought of How High 1500 and 1500 miles is you know that we travel on airplanes at about 30 000 feet that's seven miles you ever flown an airplane you better flown an airplane yes you ever gone 30 000 feet you look down and semi trucks look like smaller than ants trains look like smaller than centipedes crawling along the ground and that's only what's 30 000 divided by 52.80 whatever that is I've I don't have that in my notes was that six six miles that's six months this city is going to be 1500 miles high it's going to be over 200 percent higher than an airplane flies do you think about this that God has set up that how big it's going to be but how high it's going to be it's it's and the fact that the lamb is going to illuminate the entire city praise the Lord amen amen let's stand I'm going to stop there that was that is as I have done this one of the most fantastic details of this whole thing you got streets of gold and all the things that it talks about but that when I first learned about that one the Lord first showed me that it blew my mind 1500 200 I forgot it's 230 some I'll do the math later 230 some times higher than an airplane Fox instead of 7.9 million feet you can figure that out that's how high the city is going to be that's how high of a mountain that's why I wonder how is that going to come out of the Earth but it's very very plausible and then when you know the dimensions of the earth which I did all that to one time amen I wasn't even intending to get to that part today but anyway one thing just kind of led to another and And discussing this destruction to bring us to this point amen that's the reason that's one of the reasons for it one of the grand reasons is to bring this into being amen praise the Lord amen I'm so thankful that God has a place that he's already prepared for us amen amen praise the Lord let's see a couple of courses of this amen looking for that City praise the Lord Abraham went looking for it my heart's Desiring it amen I'm looking for a city the one not made by hands the waters will be parted and I'll be on my way as we're crossing over Jordan I can sing now I have that Everlasting towards [Music] [Music] I've heard the prophets message I've placed in my heart I've got Revelations [Music] Among Us the stages said you know and we have this precious promise we all know I have that ever asked the moment daddy blessed me he made me fully home with that Everlasting Joy within us one more time now now I have that is [Music] the Lord amen aren't you glad for that Everlasting Joy yes praise the Lord and I'm so glad that Joy's not just on my flesh it's not just something I feel from time to time but it's Everlasting in my soul yes amen that is eternal praise the Lord that is eternal amen God should bless you amen praise him through and said the blessings drink you today amen amen God's word is so good it's pure holy amen and we're getting to this new beginning Saints amen what a wonderful time it'll be amen God is so good you love him amen Lord God Rich says bless you I heard now those you may have went to Harmony I'm not sure if any of you did I wasn't able to uh as you know I wasn't here last week and then Saturday when I got home I was not feeling good at all and as witnessed here Sunday but I heard it was told that Bobby announced that that was the last Harmony uh so I don't know who of you may or may not be interested in that fact but that was what he announced that this last Harmony was the last Harmony so uh it was nice while it lasted uh it kind of got to work it was um not very well attended I remember the days when we when he first started having it I went to the very first I went to every one of the first ones for a longest time I could say I'd gone to every one of them for years but uh when they when he moved it over to the old Ramada the Center City Motel whatever it is over there now um I took up three ballrooms it was over a thousand people there now they were struggling to get Philip Tabernacle uh so I guess he just felt that the time had run its course uh maybe you don't know but John Yarbrough is the one that named it Harmony of the desert we all had meetings before it started and all was talking about different things and that was actually John's I John Yarbrough as I did a name in Harmony in the desert so it was nice I enjoyed it I appreciate brother Bobby for doing what he did with it finding it for all these years but for those you may not know that he did say that that was going to be the last one so anyway pray for him um this uh miss seeing him and a lot of the fellowship we used to have with people that I won't see very often but uh we'll go we're going to a place where we'll be together eternally amen so Lord graciously bless you anyone have anything before we dismissed today I love the Lord and I choose Jesus and I'm thankful that Jesus chose me amen that's a mouthful I think any one of us could see pray for me I'm leaving this about to 2 40 again this afternoon going to Davenport Iowa and then driving over to Des Moines Iowa in the middle of the week so we're going to apparently be a little busy I guess so appreciate your prayers for that um safe travel so Lord we just bless you anyone else was awesome God is awesome yes he is brother Pat with Jesus Christ thank you Jesus for coming here today being with us thank you for giving us revelation of the truth yes sir absolutely don't deserve anything but we we do choose you and that's what it's all about thank you you've been in time just so you could see if somebody choose you yes so everything's successful Lord we we appreciate you yes that you'd go with us yes until we meet again for our tourism thank you Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen I wish to bless you today [Music] thank you [Music] very much [Music] people that's all right back [Music]
