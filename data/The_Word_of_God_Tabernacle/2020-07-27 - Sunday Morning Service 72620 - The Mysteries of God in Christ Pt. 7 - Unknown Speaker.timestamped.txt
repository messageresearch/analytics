[6:03] amen lord bless you today again welcome
[6:06] to the service
[6:07] i want to get right to the scriptures
[6:09] and again there's a little bit i want to
[6:11] talk about after this but i do want to
[6:13] try to finish this part today
[6:14] the lord willing again if not we can
[6:19] finish it up next week i don't want to i
[6:21] don't want to box god in
[6:22] so whatever god wants to say and
[6:24] whatever purpose he wants to be done
[6:26] today i want to do it so
[6:28] but my heart my my intention is to try
[6:31] to finish this today so
[6:32] uh and and then we'll have a little bit
[6:34] of time afterwards to
[6:35] uh discuss the things i wanted to
[6:37] discuss uh
[6:39] about with the with the church and the
[6:40] building and all that's coming up with
[6:42] that
[6:42] so um i do i do definitely want to get
[6:45] to that point so now we'll go
[6:47] as we're continuing on with the same
[6:48] subject that we've been on in revelation
[6:51] chapter 10 verse 7.
[6:52] uh the mysteries of god in christ is
[6:54] part seven
[6:56] the mysteries of god in christ part
[6:58] seven and this is god revealing himself
[7:01] to his people
[7:02] uh part three so i just uh
[7:06] trust this just to be a blessing now
[7:08] revelation chapter 10 verse 7 is where
[7:10] we normally begin our scripture reading
[7:11] here
[7:12] but in the days of the voice of the
[7:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[7:16] sound the mystery singular of god should
[7:19] be finished as he had declared to his
[7:21] servants
[7:22] the prophets i know we read that every
[7:24] time
[7:25] but i do that as an opening as a as a
[7:28] re-understanding
[7:30] of what the scripture is saying here and
[7:32] and the
[7:33] point of view that we're coming from in
[7:35] this again
[7:36] basing it on brother branham's christ's
[7:38] mystery god revealed
[7:40] uh but understanding that the largest
[7:44] part of the christian world don't even
[7:47] fulfill that scripture because they
[7:49] don't know who jesus
[7:50] is a lot of people think they know who
[7:52] jesus is
[7:53] they think they have a revelation of
[7:55] jesus they think they have a
[7:56] personal relationship with jesus in a
[7:59] lot of ways
[8:00] but how can you have a personal
[8:02] relationship with somebody you don't
[8:04] know
[8:04] and a lot of them don't know him they
[8:07] know him as someone
[8:08] someone that somebody preaches about
[8:10] they know him about something that they
[8:12] read in this book
[8:13] they know him as maybe a second person
[8:16] whatever of a trinity
[8:17] or something like that but they don't
[8:18] know him know
[8:20] him personally and the revelation of
[8:23] this word
[8:24] in there most of them believe he's just
[8:27] part of a triunity
[8:29] of three different gods or something to
[8:32] that effect but
[8:33] they don't understand that mystery of
[8:36] god
[8:37] lies in jesus christ and when god's
[8:40] unveiling and
[8:41] unfolding himself to us down from
[8:44] the elohim that he was we read last week
[8:47] when
[8:47] he began created the heavens and the
[8:49] earth
[8:51] that that just unfolding down to us to
[8:53] where we could see
[8:54] and that god could reveal himself to us
[8:57] in that light
[8:58] and ending up in the place that we're
[9:00] going to get to which would be the
[9:01] second part of what we want to talk
[9:03] about is the mysteries of god in christ
[9:05] and that is god having his preeminence
[9:08] in his body of believers
[9:09] which brings us into that place so all
[9:12] these things
[9:13] to me friend all these things wind up
[9:16] in a place of bringing you to a to to an
[9:20] understanding of revelation of the
[9:21] scripture unto rapturing faith
[9:25] to be raptured you got to know who you
[9:28] are to know who you are you have to have
[9:29] faith and believe who you know you are
[9:31] and the only way you can know who you
[9:33] are and by faith believe that is to know
[9:35] who he is
[9:36] the only way you can know who he is is
[9:38] through the revelation of jesus christ
[9:39] the word has come for us in this day
[9:41] that's how you know so that's the point
[9:43] we're getting to
[9:44] to help this bring us in a closer
[9:46] relationship with the lord
[9:48] is to help us come to a greater
[9:49] revelation who he is
[9:51] and who he is and who we are in him in
[9:54] him in us
[9:55] so uh let's go and we're going to uh
[9:58] background a little bit more back in
[10:00] genesis chapter 3
[10:02] and and come through genesis 3 we've
[10:04] read it uh several times
[10:06] i i really go and reference to genesis 3
[10:09] quite a bit
[10:10] in several messages uh because
[10:13] there's just well genesis is the chief
[10:15] the the seed
[10:16] chapter uh if everything ever was it
[10:20] began here
[10:21] uh we can read in here and see in here
[10:23] the types and shadows we can see
[10:25] where god is unfolding and unveiling
[10:28] himself we can see in here
[10:29] the types and shadows as god is showing
[10:33] what he is going to do see even after
[10:36] the fall
[10:38] and of course this contains the fault so
[10:40] let's read genesis chapter 3 we'll begin
[10:42] with verse 1
[10:43] and start there now the serpent was more
[10:45] subtle than any beast of the field which
[10:47] the lord god had made
[10:49] and remember we know that word subtle is
[10:52] is
[10:53] uh beguiling but also sensible
[10:56] what he's telling her is sensible
[10:59] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[11:02] said ye
[11:02] shall not eat of every tree of the guard
[11:04] again that's the question
[11:05] to try to get her to doubt what god had
[11:07] told her
[11:08] the woman said unto the serpent we may
[11:10] eat of the fruits of the trees of the
[11:12] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[11:13] which is in the midst of the garden god
[11:15] has said
[11:15] you shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[11:17] touch it lest ye die now remember
[11:20] and it doesn't say this directly in the
[11:22] bible but
[11:23] uh eve was not there when god gave
[11:27] adam that directive if adam if god gave
[11:30] to adam that directive it was adam's
[11:32] responsibility
[11:33] to give that directive to his wife to
[11:36] his help mate
[11:37] that directive was given to her and and
[11:40] she gave that
[11:41] to the serpent now and the serpent said
[11:45] unto the woman you shall not surely die
[11:47] for god does know that the day ye
[11:49] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[11:51] ye shall be as gods knowing good and
[11:52] evil and that is true
[11:54] but understand that directive didn't
[11:56] come from the serpent
[11:57] it came from satan satan incarnate
[12:00] in the serpent so we're dealing with two
[12:03] entities here
[12:04] the woman and the serpent who both got
[12:07] second hand if you could
[12:08] if we say it that way information
[12:11] you've got hers from adam the serpent
[12:14] got his from
[12:15] satan the directed that sir the serpent
[12:19] is giving to
[12:20] her he wasn't privy to he was just a
[12:22] part of the creation when god created
[12:24] the animal kingdom
[12:25] he created the serpent which was the
[12:28] which was to be next to the man so that
[12:30] the seed would mix
[12:32] he was just that part of that animal
[12:33] kingdom that was created there he didn't
[12:35] have that
[12:36] he didn't know that that came from the
[12:37] right hand man of god at one time
[12:40] angel of light lucifer became the devil
[12:43] serpent red dragon
[12:45] satan who came down and incarnated
[12:48] himself and
[12:49] this serpent and began to feed him this
[12:52] information so the information he got to
[12:53] be gallard came from the devil
[12:56] not not the serpent it wasn't his
[12:58] information he didn't know this she
[12:59] didn't know this either
[13:00] so you understand you're dealing with
[13:02] these two entities here
[13:05] that that are contrasting each other but
[13:07] the tactic of the enemy stays the same
[13:10] and that is to get you to doubt to get
[13:12] you to doubt god's word
[13:15] now let's continue on sixth verse and
[13:17] when the woman saw that the tree was
[13:19] good for food and then it was pleasant
[13:21] to the eye and a tree to be desired to
[13:23] make one wise
[13:24] she took the fruit thereof and did eat
[13:27] so exactly what the serpent threw satan
[13:31] the satan through the serpent told her
[13:34] actually happened
[13:35] what he told her was the truth it just
[13:37] was against
[13:39] god's word there's a lot of things that
[13:41] people say out here
[13:42] that they consider to be truths but it's
[13:44] not what it's not directives of god's
[13:46] word
[13:47] and we live by god's word understand now
[13:51] so what he said actually happened she
[13:54] took
[13:54] the fruit their oven did eat see and
[13:57] then
[13:57] gave also into her husband with her and
[14:00] he did eat
[14:02] so when eve found herself in this
[14:04] condition
[14:05] she came to her husband adam adam
[14:09] then seeing her in this condition loved
[14:12] her
[14:12] so much that he was not willing that god
[14:14] would destroy her because god would have
[14:16] destroyed her
[14:17] at that moment in time had adam his his
[14:20] son his
[14:21] created son come in and took in her
[14:25] into himself now again this is this is
[14:27] just a foreshadow
[14:29] of what we saw coming in jesus christ
[14:33] because jesus god's only son
[14:36] only begotten son became sin
[14:39] by taking us into himself and became sin
[14:43] took our sin so that we could be made
[14:46] righteous
[14:48] now there the redeeming value of the
[14:51] only created son of god
[14:53] wasn't there because he was just a flesh
[14:56] man
[14:57] he was but jesus was the begotten son
[15:00] the created son the blood cell
[15:02] in the womb of a woman mary uh
[15:05] had that redemptive value adam did not
[15:09] when adam fell he he he lost
[15:13] everything uh he lost his inheritance in
[15:16] life he lost his
[15:17] right to life he lost everything
[15:21] see but he did it because he loved his
[15:23] bride so much
[15:24] he loved his wife so much he was willing
[15:27] to become
[15:27] sin for her so that god would not
[15:30] destroy her
[15:31] well the only way friend that god
[15:33] doesn't destroy us today and wipe us off
[15:36] the face of the earth
[15:37] is because of his only son christ jesus
[15:40] that came
[15:41] and took us into himself and became sin
[15:44] for us
[15:45] went to the cross for us went to hell
[15:47] for us but praised god on the third day
[15:49] he rose
[15:50] victoriously and took everything that
[15:54] adam had lost
[15:55] into his possession now satan's still
[15:58] the squatter here
[16:00] this is still satan's eden but it is no
[16:02] longer in his purview it's no longer in
[16:05] his
[16:05] ownership it belongs to god
[16:08] if it belongs to god it belongs to all
[16:10] those that are of god
[16:12] that's me that's you praise the lord we
[16:15] belong in that
[16:16] in that uh in that light because that's
[16:19] who god has made us
[16:21] but you see the type the type there of
[16:23] adam going to get his bride he became
[16:26] sin so that she would not be destroyed
[16:30] and now the eyes seventh person the eyes
[16:32] of them both were open they knew they
[16:33] were naked
[16:34] they sowed fig leaves together made
[16:36] themselves aprons every time i read the
[16:38] scripture i say this
[16:39] brother brown said if it's an apple that
[16:41] mates a woman or a man
[16:43] think know that they're naked i believe
[16:45] it's time to pass the apples again
[16:47] or whatever fruit somebody wants to
[16:49] claim they knew that they were naked
[16:51] because of the act that took place
[16:53] between them
[16:54] amen one act two children see one act
[16:57] two children got cain and abel
[16:59] from this act that took place first of
[17:01] the serpent
[17:02] and planted his seed in her and then
[17:04] with adam
[17:05] the the only redemptive way it didn't
[17:08] bring man back to god
[17:10] but it brought that seed back to the
[17:12] place it was supposed to be
[17:13] so that the seed of the righteous one
[17:16] was able to
[17:17] produce a child abel just as the
[17:21] the seed of the wicked one the serpent
[17:23] seed
[17:24] which a lot of people did not even exist
[17:26] even though we'll read here in a minute
[17:28] but that god himself talked about the
[17:30] serpent seed
[17:31] the serpent having a seed that that it
[17:33] brought forth a cane
[17:35] see the two
[17:38] the transfer of the hemoglobin the blood
[17:41] is what created this sin and then adam
[17:44] coming in
[17:45] and redeeming back that that that
[17:48] that the serpent satan had stolen
[17:51] now it was in a fallen condition it
[17:53] entered into god's permissive
[17:55] will but it was a way that that man was
[17:58] able to uh
[18:00] forge forward from that point now we
[18:02] know of course they're expelled from the
[18:04] garden of eden normal beats there we go
[18:06] we're gonna read uh some more of this
[18:07] now
[18:09] uh they knew they were naked and so fig
[18:10] leaves together made themselves aprons
[18:12] of course that's
[18:13] the man's way of always trying to cope
[18:15] with god and that's their own man-made
[18:17] ideas
[18:18] uh it wasn't uh just like cain thought
[18:22] it wasn't
[18:22] body life that was satisfactory to
[18:25] redeem man back or bring bringing back
[18:27] into a place that
[18:28] uh uh of with god again
[18:32] had to take blood it was a blood sin
[18:35] the original sin was a blood sin it
[18:37] wasn't a botany life stand
[18:39] and it had to be a blood sacrifice to
[18:41] meet that sin
[18:42] amen said that several times before but
[18:44] again just to reiterate sometimes some
[18:46] people watch these videos that may not
[18:48] have watched another one so
[18:49] i just take a moment to reiterate that
[18:51] so if you've heard me say that by
[18:53] my apologies but again the original sin
[18:56] was a blood sin
[18:57] a blood transfer of the hemoglobin blood
[19:00] had to be a sacrifice
[19:02] to meet that sin so it had to be a blood
[19:04] sacrifice a body
[19:05] body life sacrifice was not sufficient
[19:09] to cover a blood sin
[19:12] understand though and they heard the
[19:15] voice of the lord
[19:16] god walking in the garden in the cool of
[19:18] the day and adam and his wife
[19:20] hid themselves from the presence of the
[19:22] lord god amongst the trees of the garden
[19:24] now notice
[19:25] god in this so far
[19:29] adam has referred to his uh to
[19:32] the person we know as eve only his woman
[19:35] his wife or woman
[19:36] his wife hid themselves in the presence
[19:39] of the lord god amongst the trees
[19:41] of the garden the lord god called unto
[19:43] adam and said unto him where art thou
[19:46] now god knew where adam was but god
[19:48] wanted to make sure adam knew where he
[19:50] was
[19:51] what have you done adam what have you
[19:54] partaken of what i told you not to
[19:55] partake of have you done
[19:57] exactly what i told you not to do where
[20:00] has that
[20:01] put you now where is your life what's
[20:03] going on in this garden this beautiful
[20:05] place that
[20:06] i give you see because god's god's
[20:09] omnipotent he's all-knowing he's he he
[20:12] knows exactly where adam is see
[20:14] but now he's saying where are thou and
[20:17] he said i heard that i voiced the garden
[20:19] i was afraid because i was naked i hid
[20:21] myself or i
[20:22] removed myself you didn't hide you can't
[20:25] hide from god a lot of people try to
[20:27] hide from god but you can't hide from
[20:29] god
[20:30] what he did is he removed himself he
[20:33] placed a barrier
[20:34] because see again friend this is the
[20:36] created son of god this is the lineage
[20:39] of god almighty adam was
[20:41] he was perfect in every way god made
[20:44] god created so you don't you can't tell
[20:47] me that we look at it in the way that we
[20:49] look at it
[20:50] coming in the world in the falling
[20:51] condition he wasn't like that
[20:53] he was the created son of god and he
[20:57] knew
[20:57] that when the situation arose we put
[21:00] himself and his wife in
[21:02] that he had to be removed there had to
[21:05] be something to
[21:06] separate because god said the day you
[21:08] eat thereof that day you're going to die
[21:10] or you're going to be
[21:11] separated from me well there had to be a
[21:14] buffer
[21:15] there so he removes himself separates
[21:18] himself so that he's not in the direct
[21:21] presence of god god help us you're
[21:24] getting the direct presence of god in
[21:26] the wrong condition friend that could
[21:28] that could spell doom for anyone but now
[21:32] let's move on
[21:33] and he said 11th verse and he said who
[21:36] told thee that thou
[21:37] was naked hath thou eaten of the tree
[21:39] whereof i commanded thee
[21:40] that thou should not eat and the man
[21:43] said the woman
[21:44] whom thou gave is to me to be with me
[21:47] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[21:49] the lord god said unto the woman
[21:51] what is this that thou hast done the
[21:54] woman said the serpent beguiled me and i
[21:56] did eat it sounds a lot
[21:58] like today everybody wants to pass blame
[22:00] on somebody else for their own failures
[22:03] their own mistakes everybody wants to
[22:05] make everybody else
[22:06] responsible for their own happiness and
[22:09] and godliness it's not up to other
[22:11] people
[22:11] for you to be happy it's not up for
[22:13] other people to accept your
[22:14] responsibility you're responsible to god
[22:16] for yourself
[22:17] once you reach the age of accountability
[22:20] you're at a place that you're
[22:21] accountable to god for yourself so
[22:24] but it's kind of human becomes human
[22:26] nature in a falling condition and we
[22:27] just start blaming everybody else and
[22:29] everything else
[22:30] for our own mistakes and failures and
[22:33] that's exactly what they were doing in
[22:34] the garden of eden
[22:36] serpent began me i did eat 14th verse
[22:38] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[22:40] because thou hast done this thou art
[22:42] cursed above
[22:43] all cattle and above every beast of the
[22:46] field upon thy belly shalt thou
[22:48] go and thus shalt thou eat all the days
[22:50] of thy life so this
[22:51] this link that was used to be between
[22:54] the monkey and the man
[22:55] the one that was closest to the man the
[22:57] reason they cannot prove evolution as a
[23:00] fact
[23:01] was now cursed lost his limbs and was
[23:04] thrown onto his belly
[23:05] he was no more in an upright state he no
[23:08] more had limbs
[23:09] he fell and was on his belly and dust
[23:11] became his meat
[23:12] that was the serpent now that link every
[23:15] bone
[23:16] every uh facet every molecule of that
[23:20] being was
[23:20] changed because he was cursed now notice
[23:25] we're going to read it here but he never
[23:27] cursed a woman he never cursed adam
[23:30] see now they had other things that god
[23:32] put on them but he didn't curse them the
[23:34] only one he cursed was the serpent
[23:37] and in his cursing of the serpent he
[23:39] changed every molecule about
[23:41] every bit of the bone structure
[23:43] everything about this serpent
[23:45] and from an upright being with limbs
[23:47] like a man
[23:48] uh god cursed and put him on the ground
[23:52] dust shalt be thy meat all the days of
[23:54] thy light see
[23:57] thou art cursed above all the cattle
[23:58] above all the beasts of the field upon
[23:59] that belly shalt thou go
[24:01] dust shout thou eat all the days of thy
[24:03] life now look at this
[24:04] getting into another uh uh foreshadowing
[24:08] of
[24:08] jesus christ and i will put enmity
[24:11] between
[24:12] thee and the woman i will put you know
[24:15] division
[24:16] uh the enemies between thee and the
[24:18] woman and between
[24:20] thy seed and her seed so there had to be
[24:23] a serpent seed now if there
[24:27] if there is a serpent seed that serpent
[24:30] seed cannot
[24:30] exist now i'm trying to bring this out
[24:33] to understand
[24:34] where christ comes and plays this part
[24:36] in here
[24:37] but the serpent can't have a seed today
[24:41] lest there had to be a seed planted
[24:44] in this condition he was in before the
[24:47] curse
[24:48] the seed had to exist the seed had to be
[24:51] implanted
[24:52] and bring forth before god cursed him
[24:56] so that seed had to come forth at that
[24:58] time because now god's putting
[25:01] enmity an enemy division
[25:04] between that that comes forth as the
[25:06] serpent seed
[25:08] and that that comes forth as the woman's
[25:10] seed
[25:11] but now understand the woman doesn't
[25:13] have a seed
[25:15] the woman has an egg it's the man that
[25:17] has the hemoglobin the life the seed
[25:19] it's the man that has that that that is
[25:22] implanted
[25:23] that brings life to the egg see the
[25:25] woman doesn't have a seed
[25:28] so what is god talking about when he's
[25:30] talking about putting enmity
[25:32] division between a serpent seed now how
[25:36] can this serpent see
[25:37] be a serpent's seed from who they are
[25:41] today
[25:41] is a serpent crawling on its belly and
[25:44] and in the dust of the ground
[25:46] how could it be that way they don't even
[25:48] have eggs their babies are born
[25:50] live they're not hatched because
[25:54] nothing about this serpent the way it
[25:57] was before the curse is like it is now
[25:59] that serpent seed had already been
[26:02] implanted
[26:03] in the woman before the curse oh friend
[26:06] can we just see the
[26:07] scripture is so plain but that was
[26:10] implanted before the curse
[26:12] now he's cursed him and put in the deep
[26:15] division
[26:16] between his seed which came forth as
[26:19] cain
[26:19] we know we're not going to get to that
[26:21] but you read the fourth verse cain came
[26:23] forth and the bible says cain was of
[26:26] that wicked one
[26:28] he was nevada he was of the wicked one
[26:31] see
[26:31] that came forth we know that was that
[26:33] seed and
[26:34] immensely enmity between him and the
[26:37] woman's seat
[26:38] but that woman doesn't have a seed but
[26:40] old friend can't we understand
[26:43] that god appointed
[26:47] god appointed the woman a seed we've
[26:52] already read in isaiah
[26:53] when the prophecy came forth about the
[26:56] appointment of that seed
[26:58] god appointed her seed the seed that god
[27:02] created and planted in
[27:05] the woman mary appointed her
[27:09] that seed because she never knew a man
[27:12] if she never knew a man how was she
[27:14] going to receive seed
[27:16] she didn't receive seed for men because
[27:17] she never knew man so where the seed
[27:19] come from it was created seed
[27:22] it was a created seed of god that god
[27:25] placed in the womb of
[27:26] mary to bring forth jesus christ
[27:30] the only begotten son of god it was the
[27:32] only seed that could be
[27:34] of the woman that god gave her appointed
[27:37] her that seed
[27:38] a created seed and that division is
[27:41] still there today
[27:42] the division between satan and god
[27:46] the division between cain and abel the
[27:49] division between
[27:50] uh uh a judas and jesus
[27:53] the division today between those that
[27:55] are the righteous and those who are the
[27:57] ungodly
[27:58] is still the same today there's enmity
[28:01] there's division
[28:03] those two are enemies of each other the
[28:06] seed that was appointed oh frank can't
[28:08] we just see
[28:09] that seem to come forth was nothing more
[28:11] than the foretelling of jesus christ
[28:14] to come forward to be our redeemer to be
[28:18] our savior
[28:19] to bring us back from this fallen
[28:21] condition when they were kicked out of
[28:23] the garden of eden
[28:24] back to a place of redemption again back
[28:27] into full fellowship
[28:28] back into full redemption back to where
[28:31] man can receive revelation
[28:33] of god's word and god in man just like
[28:36] they did
[28:37] in the cool of the day oh wouldn't it
[28:40] have been wonderful
[28:41] he heard the voice of the lord god
[28:43] walking in the garden in the gloom of
[28:45] the day would have been wonderful it was
[28:46] one of those days
[28:48] before the fall where they had that
[28:50] wonderful fellowship and communion
[28:52] together
[28:53] oh that's exactly what god's desire to
[28:56] store back
[28:57] he's just foretelling and he's showing
[28:59] us just a couple of verses later
[29:01] exactly what he's going to do how he's
[29:03] going to do it how he's going to bring
[29:04] it forth
[29:05] and how we're going to end up back in
[29:07] complete fellowship with him again
[29:09] how we can see that god took from adam
[29:12] and made a woman
[29:13] how we can see that adam fell and became
[29:16] sin so he could redeem that woman
[29:18] and so that we now that woman of jesus
[29:21] christ
[29:22] coming out of him as a representative as
[29:25] the word itself
[29:27] and be that uh and be that light
[29:30] that god has called for this last day
[29:33] not only that but then he come
[29:34] and live in his believer he come and
[29:38] live
[29:38] in us praise the lord
[29:41] oh my it's beautiful it's beautiful
[29:44] friend now
[29:46] but i've got to move on i will put
[29:48] enmity between the woman and i
[29:49] and the and between thee and the woman
[29:52] and between thy seed and her seed
[29:54] it shall bruise thy head what the
[29:57] woman's seed
[29:59] christ shall bruise thy head and thou
[30:01] shalt bruise his heel
[30:03] obviously satan is always on the hills
[30:06] of god
[30:06] always on the heels of jesus always
[30:08] trying to personate counterfeit
[30:12] pervert what god is creating what god
[30:15] has done
[30:16] satan is always trying to pervert that
[30:19] sometimes he'll pervert it with
[30:21] 99 of the truth but he's still perverted
[30:25] sometimes he'll pervert it just like he
[30:27] perverted it in the garden of eden
[30:29] just like he tried to pervert it to
[30:31] jesus christ by getting jesus to doubt
[30:33] who he was
[30:35] well if he's going to try to get jesus
[30:37] to doubt who he was
[30:38] if he got eve to deny who she was don't
[30:41] you think he's going to try to do that
[30:42] to you
[30:43] if you're a son or daughter of god today
[30:45] that's exactly what he's going to try to
[30:47] get you to doubt
[30:48] who you are oh my but that bruising of
[30:52] the heel he's always there
[30:54] amen but where is the head of the
[30:57] serpent where is the head of the devil
[31:01] under our feet senator jesus speaks he
[31:04] said thou shalt
[31:05] uh it shall bruise thy head so
[31:08] if he's if he's under under our feet if
[31:11] he's under jesus
[31:12] he's under our feet praise the lord
[31:14] because we're more than conquerors
[31:16] through him that loved
[31:17] us amen satan is under our feet
[31:20] and we're worried to death about
[31:22] clothing come on saints
[31:24] don't don't fear that devil is under our
[31:27] feet
[31:28] you have nothing to fear god is with us
[31:32] amen upon the woman now let's move on
[31:34] 16th verse
[31:35] upon the uh unto the woman he said i
[31:38] will greatly multiply thy sorrow now
[31:40] notice again
[31:40] he didn't curse the woman he just
[31:44] made adam her ruler but look
[31:47] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[31:50] multiply thy sorrow in thy conception
[31:53] and sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[31:55] children and thy desire to be to thy
[31:57] husband
[31:58] and he shall rule over thee now he
[32:01] didn't curse her
[32:02] he just said that adam was her ruler see
[32:05] and then she would
[32:06] and sorrow bring forth children but but
[32:10] he still gave her the incredible
[32:13] responsibility
[32:14] of bringing forth those children it's
[32:17] hard to imagine it
[32:18] it's actually a hard to imagine it's
[32:20] hard to explain
[32:22] and i've tried to do it several times
[32:24] it's hard to explain even
[32:25] understand the responsibility
[32:29] that god gave to the woman in bringing
[32:32] life into this world
[32:33] not only bringing life into this world
[32:36] responsibly
[32:37] correctly bringing children to this
[32:39] world but also the responsibility of
[32:43] raising those children and the nurture
[32:44] and admonition of god
[32:47] and people want to put women down and
[32:50] say this that you know
[32:51] friend humanity would cease to have
[32:55] existed
[32:56] thousands of years ago if god hadn't
[32:58] entrusted the woman with this
[33:00] responsibility
[33:01] it's powerful it's beautiful in my
[33:04] opinion
[33:05] amen that now but her desire now
[33:08] to her husband and she and he shall rule
[33:10] over thee not a curse now
[33:12] but now unto adam he said because thou
[33:15] has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[33:17] and has eaten of the tree of which i
[33:20] commanded thee
[33:21] saying thou shalt not eat a bit cursed
[33:23] is the ground
[33:24] not adam cursed is the ground for thy
[33:27] sake and sorrow
[33:28] shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy
[33:30] life now notice
[33:32] again he didn't curse adam he cursed the
[33:35] ground
[33:35] because of adam so that adam now has to
[33:39] live by the sweat of his
[33:40] brow to get his food and his earning and
[33:43] his
[33:43] living and of course if you've ever
[33:46] worked a day out in the arizona summer
[33:48] sun
[33:49] you'll know what it means to live by the
[33:51] sweat of your brow
[33:52] it's very hot but anyway it's it's
[33:56] absolutely scriptural that's exactly
[33:58] what god did
[33:59] and that's for that's where we are
[34:01] that's where we live also notice
[34:03] i've brought this out before that god
[34:06] said
[34:08] hast thou eaten the tree which i
[34:10] commanded thee saying thou shall not eat
[34:12] of it
[34:12] now he didn't say that to eve which is
[34:14] another reason i believe
[34:16] adam told eve what god said because god
[34:19] never
[34:19] told the woman now did you do what i
[34:22] told you
[34:22] not to do he didn't say that he only
[34:24] told adam he didn't say that to the
[34:26] serpent
[34:26] he only told that to adam why because
[34:28] adam was his son
[34:30] god told his son what he wanted to get
[34:32] done
[34:33] and it was adam's responsibility to take
[34:35] care of it and to make sure it got done
[34:38] period god help us that's where we are
[34:42] today
[34:43] amen that's where we are today the
[34:46] society is the way it is because man
[34:47] hasn't took his position
[34:49] society is the way it is today because
[34:51] of the weak weakness behind pulpits
[34:53] and people don't stand on the word like
[34:55] they're supposed to and live by god's
[34:57] holy word
[34:58] you do it right it works you don't and
[35:00] it won't work it might feel better to
[35:03] you
[35:03] might look good in the politics and the
[35:06] world system
[35:07] but it's ungodly and it's not acceptable
[35:09] in god's eyes
[35:11] god didn't curse the man didn't curse
[35:14] the woman
[35:14] cursed the serpent but now the man is
[35:17] the only one he said
[35:18] i told you not to do this
[35:21] and you did it anyway notice
[35:24] now thorns also in thistles shall it
[35:27] bring forth unto thee and
[35:29] shall eat at the earth with the field in
[35:30] the sweat of thy face
[35:32] shalt thou eat bread till thou return
[35:34] unto the ground for out of it was thou
[35:36] taken for doubt dust thou
[35:38] art and to dust thou return notice
[35:42] 20th first now and adam called his
[35:44] wife's name
[35:46] eve now adam i've made this point before
[35:50] please give me a minute to make it again
[35:52] adam
[35:53] is now for the first time calling his
[35:56] wife
[35:57] eve why now
[36:00] why after all of this has happened i
[36:03] mean
[36:04] he's already named all the animals and
[36:05] plants and everything by now
[36:08] why did he not name her why when god
[36:11] created her and brought her forth from
[36:14] him he just called a woman from man
[36:18] he didn't call her evil he didn't give
[36:19] her a name
[36:21] until now until after the fall until
[36:24] after all this has happened
[36:26] because the definition of the word eve
[36:30] is the mother of all
[36:33] living never says he was the father of
[36:36] all living
[36:37] but she was the mother of all living why
[36:40] because there's seeds planted in her
[36:42] one from the serpent and one from adam
[36:45] and they're about to come forth
[36:47] in genesis chapter four cain and abel
[36:50] cain rose up of that wicked one and slew
[36:53] his brother
[36:54] notice that now that time
[36:58] where adam is calling her eve to
[37:00] differentiate
[37:01] her from him and to differentiate and to
[37:04] help understand
[37:05] where she was now because now she's
[37:08] pregnant with twins
[37:10] she's pregnant with two boys a canaan
[37:12] and abel
[37:13] one is from him one is from the serpent
[37:16] serpent seed understand
[37:20] serpent seed anybody says there's no
[37:22] serpent seed in the bible
[37:24] it just doesn't know their bible serpent
[37:27] seed now she's eve
[37:28] mother of all living adam not the father
[37:31] of all living
[37:32] let's continue because i want to get to
[37:34] 23rd 21st first
[37:35] and we'll finish this chapter unto adam
[37:39] also
[37:40] and to his wife did the lord god make
[37:42] coats of skins
[37:43] and clothe them now we've got the
[37:45] appropriate sacrifice
[37:47] now we've got a sacrifice that's
[37:49] acceptable by god
[37:51] because it's god's sacrifice it was
[37:53] god's decision
[37:55] was god's choice it was god who made
[37:57] this
[37:58] an acceptable sacrifice that two lambs
[38:02] had to give their innocent lives and
[38:05] shed their blood
[38:06] so that adam and eve could come back out
[38:09] into the presence of god again
[38:11] not like it was because that blood only
[38:14] covered the sin it did not annihilate it
[38:16] had to take the creative blood of god in
[38:19] the in
[38:20] in the person of jesus christ the word
[38:22] became flesh
[38:24] to bleed and so that bleeding word
[38:27] could then cover or not cover annihilate
[38:30] the sin so that the sin no longer
[38:33] exists in the mind of god to those who
[38:36] receive
[38:37] that redemptive plan amen is that simple
[38:40] but this could not do it this this blood
[38:43] sacrifice of these only allowed them to
[38:45] come out
[38:46] into god's presence only allow them to
[38:48] come to a place where
[38:50] uh they could uh they could be in god's
[38:53] presence again but then god still kicked
[38:55] him out he didn't come out in the cool
[38:56] of the day anymore he kicked them out of
[38:57] the garden of eden put the
[38:59] cherubims there the flaming swords to
[39:01] guard it and keep her
[39:03] keep them from it now i want to read a
[39:07] couple of things to reiterate this
[39:09] to solidify this if you will bring this
[39:12] uh
[39:12] into a little little circle now christ
[39:15] and mystery god revealed
[39:18] um uh let's see here god himself
[39:22] uh to take the penalty of his own law
[39:26] death to die to redeem the wife that was
[39:29] lost
[39:30] by rejecting him praise the lord let's
[39:33] read that again
[39:34] god himself god himself again
[39:37] not a second person third person not
[39:40] some great man
[39:41] some pro great prophet somebody that
[39:43] they learned in the seminary or
[39:44] from of the bible but god
[39:48] god himself to take the penalty of his
[39:51] own law
[39:51] death to die now that penalty was just
[39:55] given as we read by those two lambs
[39:58] it was acceptable by god why was it
[40:02] acceptable
[40:03] because there had to be a blood
[40:04] sacrifice to meet
[40:06] the blood sin amen
[40:10] to die to redeem the wife that was lost
[40:12] by rejecting him when eve went away from
[40:15] the word
[40:16] she went away from her mate the word
[40:19] and her mate amen notice in the
[40:22] in the beginning we talked about god
[40:24] created the heaven and the earth
[40:26] wealth was out form and void and the
[40:28] spirit of god
[40:30] moved out upon the face of the water
[40:32] remember in the beginning was the word
[40:33] the word was with god the word was god
[40:36] the word logos that is god
[40:39] logos the word is god it's the existence
[40:42] of of god the word
[40:46] that word then
[40:50] became flesh and dwelt among us as we
[40:54] read last week
[40:55] but now when eve went away from the word
[40:57] she went away from her mate
[40:59] why was that her word for that day
[41:03] see because remember uh
[41:06] i believe it's uh peter talks about
[41:09] being established in the
[41:10] present day truth so there's a present
[41:15] day truth of the slowly
[41:16] unfolding mysteries of god bringing
[41:19] himself down to a place
[41:21] to reveal himself to his people in a
[41:24] capacity
[41:25] that we could receive it understand it
[41:28] by revelation
[41:29] not by knowledge but by revelation i
[41:31] have to be a theologian
[41:32] you know don't have to have some great
[41:34] education to know what this
[41:36] is to know who this is amen this is god
[41:39] but now when she went away from the
[41:41] words she went away from her mate what
[41:42] was her mate her mate was the word
[41:45] how was he the word he wasn't the word
[41:48] in the sense that jesus was
[41:50] he wasn't the word in the sense that the
[41:52] spirit of god moved out
[41:54] because this man was a creation of god
[41:57] but he was the word to her the
[41:59] present-day truth to her in the sense
[42:02] that
[42:03] uh what god directives
[42:07] and word was he gave to adam
[42:10] and when he gave that word to adam and
[42:12] then created from
[42:14] him her that made him
[42:17] the word to her because god didn't
[42:20] directly give that word
[42:22] to her he gave it to adam and it was
[42:25] adam's responsibility
[42:27] to give that word to her so when she
[42:30] left
[42:30] him she left the word because he was
[42:33] that word
[42:34] to her understand when she went away
[42:38] from the words she went away from
[42:39] me and when the church the bride i'll
[42:42] say
[42:43] goes away from the word to a
[42:44] denomination
[42:46] she rejects and commits fornication with
[42:49] the world of man's wisdom
[42:51] rejecting the authority of god's word
[42:54] now you see here how the bride today
[42:57] even though there's
[42:59] males like myself a part of that bride
[43:02] is in its designation feminish
[43:05] because we are bride to him
[43:09] to god the eternal one
[43:12] who in god what from the beginning was
[43:14] both male and female
[43:15] he was everything everything that's ever
[43:17] been existed manifested in the world
[43:19] today man woman
[43:20] children and animals body that was in
[43:23] god
[43:24] it's all in god to start with see so the
[43:27] designation
[43:28] of that to us today as bride
[43:32] is is in its feminist form just because
[43:35] of the type of god
[43:38] himself jehovah
[43:41] having a bride a helpmate a a companion
[43:45] see that's why he likes to talk and
[43:48] fellowship
[43:49] and and and have fellowship with him
[43:52] with us
[43:53] that's why we should take that time and
[43:55] have that fellowship with the lord
[43:57] he meant to have that time with god had
[43:58] that intimate relationship at that time
[44:01] that there's a fellowship there's a
[44:03] communion it's not just an inherent boy
[44:05] it's not just a
[44:06] supplication god give me give me give me
[44:08] no it's a relationship
[44:10] if you have a true good relationship
[44:12] with anybody friend it's not
[44:13] it's not a give a give a gift it's a
[44:16] relationship
[44:17] it's both ways it's love it's compassion
[44:20] it's
[44:20] it's giving it's uh being given
[44:24] that's the way that's the way it is amen
[44:28] but when when the bride goes away from
[44:30] the word to a denomination
[44:32] which obviously saying here the word is
[44:34] not dwell in denominations
[44:36] she rejects commits fornication against
[44:39] uh with the
[44:40] world of men's wisdom rejecting god's
[44:43] authority
[44:44] she's rejecting god she's rejected the
[44:46] word she's gone to some hybridism
[44:49] to some man-made idea or opinion of it
[44:52] instead of the true revelation of the
[44:53] word
[44:55] a lot of people are doing that today
[44:58] a lot of people are standing right in
[45:00] the midst of what they call themselves
[45:02] message
[45:03] and have entered into a denomination
[45:06] they've entered into a denomination
[45:08] saying that they're in the message
[45:11] no the message isn't denominated but
[45:13] people have denominated themselves
[45:15] inside this message and
[45:18] unfortunately a lot of times people have
[45:21] used
[45:22] and and portrayed the word message
[45:25] basically in the same context as baptist
[45:28] and methodist and pentecostals do
[45:32] what's the difference i beg to ask you
[45:35] what's the difference
[45:37] it's not a covering friend god didn't
[45:40] send a prophet a messenger
[45:42] to make this some kind of a covering
[45:44] some kind of a religion
[45:46] something that you can soothe your
[45:48] savage conscience by
[45:50] this is something to bring us into a
[45:53] relationship with jesus christ
[45:55] that we have one-on-one communion and
[45:57] fellowship with him daily
[45:59] daily you can't do it unless god has
[46:02] come himself
[46:03] and revealed himself to you made himself
[46:06] known and opened himself so that you can
[46:08] see that
[46:09] a revelation praise the lord god give us
[46:13] that communion that fellowship we need
[46:16] now to follow up this last scripture and
[46:18] show us the father
[46:20] this is june 1953 and could you imagine
[46:24] god throwing back in them uh throwing
[46:27] back in them bushes
[46:28] they're an old pair of bloody sheepskin
[46:31] here come the most beautiful woman ever
[46:34] lived in the face of the earth
[46:35] wrapped up her blonde hair hanging down
[46:38] her back like this
[46:39] didn't even know she was naked before
[46:41] this old bloody sheepskin around her the
[46:43] blood running down her
[46:45] uh and the beautiful woman that she was
[46:48] could you imagine coming out into the
[46:50] presence of god
[46:52] and that old sheepskin slapping their
[46:54] legs as they walk out into the presence
[46:56] of god
[46:57] kind of had a ring to it i imagine a
[47:00] ring that god was more pleased with than
[47:02] the condition they were before can you
[47:04] imagine just like he set the priesthood
[47:06] up when he had to make their garments
[47:08] and had to put the bells and the
[47:10] pomegranates around the bottom
[47:11] you know when they come into the
[47:13] presence of god when the high priest
[47:14] come behind
[47:15] into the holies of holies it had to ring
[47:18] out holy holy holy lord god almighty
[47:21] there had to be a reign to that that was
[47:24] pleasing to the lord because it was
[47:26] something that was according to god's
[47:28] word
[47:29] it was something that was pleasing to
[47:30] god it was because it was a directive of
[47:33] god they obeyed the word
[47:35] this was a directive of god this was the
[47:37] sheep that god had killed and had given
[47:39] to them and those sheep
[47:41] skins slapping their legs had to just be
[47:43] music to god
[47:45] it was a horrible sound obviously it was
[47:48] a bloody mess that adam the most
[47:50] beautiful handsome man of
[47:52] eve the most beautiful woman walked out
[47:54] into his presence again with this bloody
[47:56] mess
[47:57] but it was what was pleasing to the lord
[48:00] the revelation of that was obtained by
[48:02] abel
[48:03] so by faith hebrews 11 abel was off to
[48:07] offer unto god a more excellent
[48:09] sacrifice than cain
[48:10] cain was of the wicked one cain was of
[48:12] the serpent seed
[48:13] amen abel was of god god seed god's
[48:16] lineage to receive revelation
[48:18] to see what the truth of it was that
[48:20] when they walked out and that certain
[48:21] music played as that sheepskin
[48:23] slapped against their legs was something
[48:26] that was acceptable to god
[48:28] oh it looked horrible to humans it
[48:30] looked hoy can you imagine how horrible
[48:32] it would have looked can you imagine
[48:33] the kind of ridicule that would be today
[48:37] the ridicule that those who do follow
[48:39] the word get today
[48:40] the people that desire to live a holy
[48:43] godly life
[48:44] the people that decide to live by the
[48:47] word of god and accept
[48:48] god's word as their absolute in the
[48:51] ridicule that they get today
[48:53] the ridicule that comes their way but
[48:56] people wanting to
[48:57] uh make it any kind of a thing they want
[49:00] to by man's denomination of man-made
[49:03] ideas friend there's only one way to god
[49:06] and that's by his word
[49:07] that's by obedience in his word it's the
[49:09] only way that you're going to be
[49:10] pleasing to god
[49:12] that's how it was pleasing to god here
[49:14] that music
[49:16] that sound that was going as they were
[49:18] walking forth out from behind those
[49:20] bushes
[49:21] with that sheepskin slapping that blood
[49:23] splattering everywhere
[49:25] it was music to god it was acceptable to
[49:28] god because it was god's way
[49:30] now if you don't like god's way you need
[49:33] to talk to god about that
[49:34] you don't talk to the preacher pastor
[49:36] you talk to god you don't like the way
[49:38] god's word is
[49:39] you don't like god's ways you need to
[49:41] talk to god about that
[49:42] you need to go to him and tell him that
[49:43] you've got a better idea
[49:45] go to god and tell them you've got a
[49:47] better plan you think there's a better
[49:49] way of doing it you go ahead and do that
[49:51] go ahead and see how far you get i would
[49:54] say good luck but i don't believe in
[49:56] luck
[49:58] amen let's go on and um
[50:02] turn over to hebrews
[50:06] hebrews
[50:09] chapter 6. look at hebrews chapter six
[50:17] maybe i have time a few more minutes
[50:19] please to get uh
[50:20] get through this little bit that i want
[50:22] to do here now
[50:24] uh hebrews chapter six and uh
[50:27] and get to this place now of course uh
[50:32] we obviously realized as i went to this
[50:34] point that
[50:35] that those bloody sheepskin those
[50:37] innocent lambs
[50:39] was nothing more than a type of jesus
[50:41] the sacrifice that god gave there those
[50:44] those lambs that he created that god had
[50:47] formed the
[50:48] the their bloody sheepskins that was the
[50:51] sacrifice give there was just a
[50:53] representation of
[50:54] for thought for knowledge foreshadow of
[50:57] what god was going to do with his only
[50:59] son jesus
[51:00] jesus was going to come then to be the
[51:03] sacrificial lamb the absolute
[51:07] amen the finish of it so that sacrifice
[51:10] basically
[51:11] again was just a foretelling of jesus
[51:14] christ now
[51:15] let's find another unfolding that was
[51:18] there's a couple point
[51:20] more points i wanted to make probably
[51:22] i'm probably not going to get to them
[51:23] today
[51:24] i apologize but hebrews chapter 6 verse
[51:27] 20
[51:29] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[51:32] even jesus made a high priest after
[51:35] for forever after the order of
[51:38] melchizedek
[51:39] now melchizedek if you go back into
[51:42] genesis you'll see with
[51:43] abraham melchizedek came to abraham
[51:47] after the slaughter of the king where he
[51:49] went to rescue lot
[51:51] and adam abraham came forth
[51:54] uh victoriously and melchizedek met him
[51:57] there on the road
[51:59] melchizedek brought wine and bread
[52:02] to have communion that communion and
[52:05] fellowship there with his
[52:06] victorious son was nothing more than a
[52:09] symbolic
[52:10] gesture of the partaking of we have of
[52:13] his
[52:14] body and blood today the symbol of the
[52:16] communion the symbol of the lord's
[52:18] supper
[52:19] well it was here that melchizedek
[52:22] came and met abraham there
[52:25] after that slaughter of the kings
[52:28] melchizedek
[52:29] uh eludes a lot of theologians
[52:33] and bible scholars today they still
[52:37] can't understand or grasp who milk
[52:40] hesitate was
[52:41] he's a person priesthood they can't
[52:43] believe he's a person
[52:45] but if you understand again the
[52:48] condescension of god
[52:49] and god unfolding himself down
[52:52] the creation of god being able to
[52:56] or i say creation of god that might not
[52:57] be the right way to put it but the
[52:59] creation of this
[53:00] of this melchizedek uh was
[53:03] was in a word body or we call a
[53:06] theophany
[53:07] a theophany body compared disappeared
[53:10] he appeared there with abraham
[53:13] and let's read and we can see how
[53:16] the definition the explanation
[53:19] melchizedek is here
[53:21] because jesus again 20th verse
[53:24] made it high priest forever after
[53:28] the order of melchizedek so there had to
[53:30] be a significance to this melchizedek
[53:33] from back in
[53:34] genesis for god to write in here or make
[53:39] jesus that high priest forever after
[53:41] that order of melchizedek
[53:43] look now seventh chapter first first
[53:46] for this melchizedek king of salem
[53:50] priest of the most high god who met
[53:53] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[53:55] the kings
[53:56] and blessed him to whom
[53:59] also abraham gave a tenth part
[54:02] now who would this melchizedek be now
[54:05] you can go back and listen to the
[54:07] message who is this melchizedek
[54:09] which i would highly recommend
[54:10] tremendous message in its own right but
[54:12] who is this melchizedek would be the
[54:15] question that i would have who is
[54:17] this melchizedek well first of all we
[54:19] know he was king of salem which is king
[54:21] of righteousness or king of peace
[54:23] salem is peace he is the king of
[54:25] righteousness king of salem which is
[54:27] king of peace
[54:28] and abraham gave a tenth part of all
[54:32] so abraham tithed to melchizedek
[54:36] now look friend scripturally there's
[54:39] only one
[54:40] that is to receive tithing and that's
[54:42] god
[54:44] god is the only one that receives
[54:46] tightening of his people
[54:48] god is the one that gets that it's not a
[54:50] man
[54:51] it's not an entity it's not even a
[54:53] priesthood
[54:54] god just made them stewards of his
[54:56] tithing
[54:57] that's all that's almost the priesthood
[54:59] is the ministry
[55:00] is nothing more than stewards of god's
[55:03] money that's just the way god made it
[55:05] but the tithing is god's that goes to
[55:08] god that's god's money
[55:10] god determines what happens to that see
[55:13] and he gives in his word what it does so
[55:15] when abraham's giving him tithing
[55:17] obviously abraham knew who he was he was
[55:20] the great elohim the great one that had
[55:23] been talking to him
[55:24] this whole time and speaking to abraham
[55:26] and telling him
[55:27] to separate himself and to get out from
[55:29] among his family
[55:30] and to go to a land that he was to show
[55:32] him see
[55:34] abraham recognized that he knew that in
[55:37] this melchizedek he's just seeing it
[55:39] in a bodily form now it's not the body
[55:42] that was
[55:42] jesus but jesus but this logos
[55:46] melchizedek theophany became
[55:50] jesus because it's the self-same god
[55:53] when you chop god up into three four
[55:55] five ten pieces then you've got a mess
[55:57] if you try to
[55:58] follow it with the bible but if you
[56:00] realize the truth of this godhead
[56:03] christ being that mystery of god
[56:06] revealed it becomes very plain
[56:08] and you see this melchizedek he's the
[56:11] king of rice's king of satan which is
[56:13] king of peace
[56:14] the priest is the most high god forever
[56:17] abraham gave a tenth part of all abraham
[56:20] wouldn't give just anybody god's money
[56:23] amen you don't give just anybody
[56:27] god's money if you want to buy an old
[56:29] lady a set of tires do it with your own
[56:31] money
[56:32] that's god's money you give god's money
[56:34] his money
[56:35] it's his see abraham gave it to him god
[56:38] abraham would
[56:40] god's god's prophet god's word prophet
[56:43] would have given
[56:44] god's money to anybody to all
[56:47] first being by interpretation because
[56:50] again he's the priest of the most high
[56:51] god
[56:54] first being my interpretation king of
[56:56] righteousness and after that also king
[56:58] of salem which is king of peace
[57:00] without father without
[57:03] mother without descent
[57:07] now who is that who is that has ever not
[57:11] had a father mother
[57:12] or without descent who there's only one
[57:16] there's one eternal infinite
[57:20] and that's god god is the only one
[57:23] that's eternal
[57:24] god's the only one that is infinite god
[57:26] is the only one that is the elohim
[57:29] self-existing without father without
[57:32] mother
[57:32] without the sin no having neither
[57:35] beginning of days nor end of life
[57:38] how does that fit any man
[57:41] it it can't it has to be god
[57:45] praise the lord but made like unto the
[57:47] son of god
[57:48] abideth a priest continually the
[57:51] continual priest now
[57:53] fourth first now consider how great this
[57:56] man
[57:56] now if you look in your bible
[58:00] you'll see an asterisk or a blocked off
[58:03] word most of them will especially if you
[58:06] have a king james or old king james
[58:08] mine's italicized
[58:10] the word was was italicized now i'm sure
[58:13] most of you know this
[58:15] but if you see an italicized word like
[58:17] that in the bible or one that's blocked
[58:19] off
[58:19] not necessarily parentheses but blocked
[58:21] off those words were
[58:23] added they're not a part of the original
[58:26] greek or
[58:27] hebrew text they're added to try to help
[58:30] with the flow
[58:32] of reading the bible see so when you
[58:34] read this you say now
[58:36] consider how great this man was see so
[58:38] it's supposed to help with the flow
[58:40] but the word was is not a part
[58:44] of the original text so let's
[58:47] take that word out i don't mean to take
[58:49] from the word but again
[58:50] that word was added that word's not a
[58:53] part of the original text it was added
[58:55] for
[58:55] flow for for reading flow
[58:58] so now if you take that word was out
[59:01] which was not a part of the original
[59:02] text and say
[59:03] now consider how great this man
[59:08] or we could say is they have was
[59:12] this man is not a was he is an is
[59:16] he can appear disappear be anywhere
[59:18] anytime
[59:19] he wants to he can come in theophany
[59:22] form
[59:23] he can come in the form of another man
[59:25] he can come in a cloud
[59:27] oh in a cloud really you mean god can
[59:30] come in a cloud
[59:31] even like a circular cloud with angels
[59:33] and he can come in a cloud
[59:35] well how do you think he came to the
[59:36] children of israel he came to the
[59:38] children of israel by day in a cloud
[59:42] he came to them at night in a pillar of
[59:43] fire how do you think he came to saul
[59:46] saul looked up and what did he see a
[59:48] cloud
[59:50] oh mercy people
[59:55] help us lord
[59:58] revelation makes everything simple
[1:00:00] doesn't it
[1:00:01] he came in a cloud saul looked up and
[1:00:04] said
[1:00:05] who art thou lord lord elohim
[1:00:09] he said i am jesus a voice spoke out of
[1:00:13] the cloud and said
[1:00:14] i am jesus who you are persecuting
[1:00:17] or was he he wasn't clouded
[1:00:20] this man is not a was he is an is
[1:00:24] he is a always continually existing
[1:00:28] never began never ended god almighty
[1:00:31] in theophany form of melchizedek who
[1:00:34] then
[1:00:35] came into the form of flesh
[1:00:39] jesus christ why did he have to come in
[1:00:42] the form of jesus christ
[1:00:44] in the flesh you said well he was flesh
[1:00:47] there was theophany
[1:00:48] body when he come and met abraham before
[1:00:51] he sent the angels down to sodom and
[1:00:52] gomorrah what
[1:00:53] he brought he ate he came and had
[1:00:56] communion with abraham
[1:00:58] he had bread and wine
[1:01:01] he came there with abraham in the
[1:01:04] the tent and he sat there and and sarah
[1:01:08] cooked in food
[1:01:10] he ate food he ate and drank
[1:01:13] in this theophany so what was the point
[1:01:15] of that
[1:01:16] creation of god coming in in the womb of
[1:01:19] a woman
[1:01:21] because jesus had to become a kinsmen
[1:01:25] to fulfill the scripture he had to
[1:01:28] become a kinsmen
[1:01:29] to be able to redeem those that are of
[1:01:32] the flesh he had to come
[1:01:33] in the flesh the kinsmen human flesh
[1:01:37] to redeem those that were in human flesh
[1:01:41] the redemption of jesus the only way for
[1:01:44] him to be a kinsman
[1:01:46] was to become like us in the form
[1:01:49] of sinful flesh in the likeness
[1:01:52] of sinful flesh he had to come that way
[1:01:56] but first god's condem sending him
[1:01:58] showing himself all along
[1:02:00] god came in a burning push to moses
[1:02:03] he also came when he hid out he had most
[1:02:06] in the clapton rock covered his eyes and
[1:02:08] he saw the higher part of a man
[1:02:10] come in the world went to job he said
[1:02:12] well god can only do this this everybody
[1:02:15] wants to box god
[1:02:16] into things and say well you can't do
[1:02:17] this god well you can't do that god but
[1:02:20] that can't be god
[1:02:22] praying god can do anything he wants he
[1:02:24] can be anywhere anytime to anybody he
[1:02:26] wants to
[1:02:28] it's his chosen that's his decision
[1:02:31] and there he come in the form of
[1:02:34] melchizedek
[1:02:35] without father without mother without
[1:02:37] descent either having beginning of days
[1:02:38] or end of life but made like to the son
[1:02:40] of god about this preacher continually
[1:02:42] now consider how great this man
[1:02:45] not was this man
[1:02:48] he's not a used to be he is a perpetual
[1:02:51] continuance
[1:02:52] existence of now he is
[1:02:57] unto whom even the patriarch abram gave
[1:02:59] abraham
[1:03:00] gave a tenth of the spoils and verily
[1:03:02] they that are the sons of levi who
[1:03:04] receive the office of the priesthood
[1:03:06] have a commandment to take
[1:03:07] tithes of the people according to the
[1:03:09] law that is of their brethren
[1:03:12] though they come out of the loins of
[1:03:14] abraham
[1:03:15] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:03:18] them
[1:03:19] received tithes of abraham blessed him
[1:03:21] that he
[1:03:22] uh that had the promises and without all
[1:03:25] contradiction the less is
[1:03:27] blessed the better and here men that
[1:03:29] died received tithes but there he
[1:03:31] receiveth them of whom it is witness
[1:03:34] that he liveth and so i may say so say
[1:03:37] levi also we receive tithes
[1:03:39] aid tithes in abraham for it was yet the
[1:03:41] laws of his father
[1:03:43] when melchizedek met him he was this
[1:03:45] melchizedek
[1:03:47] this melchizedek is nothing more than
[1:03:49] the logos that came out
[1:03:51] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:03:53] was with god and the word was god the
[1:03:54] word was made flesh
[1:03:56] it's that same spirit that is god that
[1:03:58] come forth
[1:03:59] that god had met and had fellowship now
[1:04:02] when
[1:04:03] when those three angels came to abraham
[1:04:06] abraham
[1:04:06] fell on his face and said my lord
[1:04:08] there's three men
[1:04:09] standing in front of him but he says my
[1:04:12] lord
[1:04:12] singular why because he's only
[1:04:15] addressing the one in the middle
[1:04:16] he's only addressing the one that became
[1:04:19] in the middle
[1:04:20] at calvary he's only addressing the
[1:04:23] elohim the self-existing god almighty
[1:04:26] you say well how could that be god
[1:04:27] abraham said it was he said that can't
[1:04:30] be god
[1:04:31] abraham said it was he said lord my
[1:04:34] elohim lord he didn't address the other
[1:04:38] two
[1:04:38] michael gabriel whoever god blew dust
[1:04:41] out and said hey michael stand in this
[1:04:42] blue dust gabriel sent in this and he
[1:04:44] walks up
[1:04:46] and the three of them walk up there
[1:04:47] because the two are getting ready to go
[1:04:48] to sodom and gomorrah
[1:04:50] and he says my lord singular because
[1:04:54] he's only addressing the one
[1:04:55] he's not addressing the other two he's
[1:04:57] addressing that one that he had been
[1:04:59] talking to
[1:05:00] that had been talking to him this whole
[1:05:02] time the one that came to him and that
[1:05:04] and that theophy of melchizedek that
[1:05:06] priesthood
[1:05:07] that melchizedek priesthood that's only
[1:05:09] the idea of don't get
[1:05:11] messed up in the verbiage friend it's
[1:05:12] only the that office
[1:05:15] it's only that part that was being
[1:05:17] played my wish
[1:05:18] my time is up now i got to close but
[1:05:22] lord really next week we'll get to that
[1:05:24] part where we understand
[1:05:26] where these parts come in where these
[1:05:29] offices are played how they're played
[1:05:32] how god unfolds himself so that we can
[1:05:34] see that
[1:05:36] and and realize who it is abraham knew
[1:05:38] who it was that's why he said my lord
[1:05:40] locke didn't know who it was because
[1:05:41] when the two angels came to him he said
[1:05:43] my lord's
[1:05:44] plural of course the main one
[1:05:48] god did not go down to sodom and
[1:05:50] gomorrah even though he says i am going
[1:05:52] to go
[1:05:53] well when god went he sent his angels
[1:05:55] down there to check it out to see
[1:05:57] amen but it was still god revealing
[1:06:00] himself it was still god
[1:06:02] unfolding himself it was still god
[1:06:04] manifesting himself so we could see
[1:06:06] in that who he is amen i have a
[1:06:10] quote i wanted to read here i'm going to
[1:06:12] say that for next week it's a little bit
[1:06:14] lengthy
[1:06:14] so we can pick this up and finish that
[1:06:16] off
[1:06:18] and get into that part that i
[1:06:21] really want to get to today but
[1:06:25] we can recognize then who who he is
[1:06:29] and the revelation of who he is
[1:06:32] and how the scripture is so perfect
[1:06:35] and unfolding it to us and uh seeing
[1:06:38] that and seeing him in there and it
[1:06:42] really revealed to us it becomes really
[1:06:46] dare as i say plain simple
[1:06:50] because it doesn't take a theologian to
[1:06:52] understand it
[1:06:53] it just takes the holy spirit in
[1:06:55] revelation to be able to
[1:06:57] understand it to be able to grasp it and
[1:06:59] let god
[1:07:00] reveal it to you so that we become it
[1:07:04] becomes a part of us because that's who
[1:07:06] we are
[1:07:07] amen so just lord really hang on to that
[1:07:10] at that end we'll stop there with the
[1:07:12] milk hesitate and
[1:07:14] try to pick it up there at the end of
[1:07:15] milk has a dig then and get
[1:07:17] down into the flesh of jesus and and
[1:07:19] hopefully bring into the preeminence of
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:22] in the body of believers today that's
[1:07:24] where we are
[1:07:25] amen expecting and praying and hoping to
[1:07:29] be that
[1:07:30] that preeminence that god has in in his
[1:07:33] body of believers
[1:07:34] today and we're the embodiment of jesus
[1:07:38] christ and that
[1:07:39] he reveals himself in and through us
[1:07:43] so god bless you today uh i mentioned to
[1:07:46] you
[1:07:47] i pray something will say the blessing
[1:07:48] strength here today
[1:07:50] uh i meant i mentioned to you that i
[1:07:52] wanted to talk to you just for a moment

[1:08:40] we've got the church all cleared out
[1:08:44] it's one big room now but when they had
[1:08:47] built a ceiling in below the original
[1:08:50] ceiling the original the original
[1:08:52] ceiling is about eight inches higher
[1:08:54] than
[1:08:55] uh the existing current ceiling
[1:08:58] uh that's up they built it down and
[1:09:02] they built it on some of the four by
[1:09:04] sixes that were holding the walls up was
[1:09:06] holding the ceiling up
[1:09:07] so and taking some of those down the
[1:09:10] ceiling kind of started to come down
[1:09:12] found out that the wiring which we're
[1:09:14] going to have to completely redo
[1:09:16] was all above the second ceiling which
[1:09:19] would have cut into the primary ceiling
[1:09:21] secondary ceiling just to get to
[1:09:23] to try to fix um uh we just decided
[1:09:26] we're just
[1:09:27] gonna and not to mention we need to put
[1:09:29] new lighting and stuff in we're just
[1:09:31] gonna take the whole ceiling down
[1:09:32] new ceiling old ceiling uh just up to
[1:09:35] the rafters
[1:09:36] uh me and brother rogers gonna get some
[1:09:38] people this week to do that they're
[1:09:39] gonna
[1:09:40] bring it all down and haul it all off
[1:09:42] for us and then we're gonna start fresh
[1:09:44] we're gonna put our air ducting in
[1:09:46] how and where we want it and our
[1:09:47] lighting how and where we want it have a
[1:09:49] drop ceiling
[1:09:50] and uh get it painted look really good
[1:09:53] it should be a beautiful place float out
[1:09:55] the floor
[1:09:56] and uh lord willing to put some carpet
[1:09:58] down and it should be a really beautiful
[1:09:59] place that being said
[1:10:01] our intention is to try to
[1:10:04] have live church services there
[1:10:07] next sunday there's a lot to do between
[1:10:10] now and next sunday so if we're not able
[1:10:12] to i'll certainly let you know
[1:10:14] and keep you abreast of what's going on
[1:10:16] that we may have to do it the following
[1:10:18] we may have to start our first service
[1:10:20] the following sunday which should be
[1:10:22] august 9th
[1:10:23] uh before we do that but we're just
[1:10:25] trusting believing if everything goes
[1:10:27] uh like we're hoping to and uh there's
[1:10:30] quite a bit of cost involved
[1:10:31] uh to get this like this and the place
[1:10:34] that we can use it the way we'd like to
[1:10:36] and stuff
[1:10:37] so uh lord willing is again
[1:10:40] the intention is to have our first
[1:10:41] service next sunday there
[1:10:44] remember it is at 2544
[1:10:47] north country club it's just north of
[1:10:49] grant on country club on the east side
[1:10:51] of the road
[1:10:53] so if you've never been there it's mike
[1:10:55] behar's old insurance office
[1:10:57] it's a nice place you really like it
[1:10:59] it's it's uh
[1:11:00] it's it's its own building there's
[1:11:02] nothing attached to it there's parking
[1:11:04] in the back there's gates on the side
[1:11:06] and the front so but just bear with us
[1:11:09] and let you know that's what's going on
[1:11:11] hopefully
[1:11:13] sister did a great job cleaning it up to
[1:11:15] uh
[1:11:16] going to get dirty again but we can
[1:11:18] clean it up again
[1:11:20] and it won't be as hard to clean up
[1:11:22] because you cleaned up the first time
[1:11:24] you know if you're having to clean up
[1:11:25] clean up uh it's a little easier than
[1:11:27] cleaning up the dirty dirty uh the
[1:11:30] cleaner it is when you go to clean it
[1:11:32] the easier it is to clean
[1:11:33] the dirtier it is when you go to clean
[1:11:35] it the harder it is to clean so you've
[1:11:36] already cleaned it so
[1:11:37] praise the lord it should be should be
[1:11:39] good and um
[1:11:41] and get it to where it's usable for us
[1:11:43] it may not be
[1:11:44] exactly what we want it to be in fact it
[1:11:47] probably is not likely going to be
[1:11:48] exactly like we want it to be when we
[1:11:50] have our first service but it'll be
[1:11:52] sufficient to have the service so
[1:11:55] just remember that we love you
[1:11:58] appreciate you
[1:11:59] and uh just be praying for that and
[1:12:01] trusting the lord just continue to
[1:12:03] supply that for us and god's just been
[1:12:06] good to us from this thing was just
[1:12:08] want to tell you sometimes it's just
[1:12:09] this i'll tell everybody the whole story
[1:12:11] but this was just dropped in our laps
[1:12:14] we weren't looking for this oh we were
[1:12:15] looking for things but
[1:12:17] uh you know another place to go but this
[1:12:19] just just
[1:12:21] chopped in our lamps i'll tell you the
[1:12:23] story of the lord well and some of you
[1:12:24] know but
[1:12:25] anyway so uh just be in prayer about
[1:12:27] that and just
[1:12:28] uh well and i will let you know and keep
[1:12:31] you abreast of what
[1:12:32] the plans are for next sunday so i
[1:12:35] appreciate you being here

[1:12:38] today i pray something was said to bless
[1:12:40] and strengthen you today
[1:12:41] let's just depart if we could once again
[1:12:43] with the word of prayer

[1:12:50] much father for your precious word we
[1:12:52] thank you so much for the revelation of
[1:12:54] that word we thank you for a prophet
