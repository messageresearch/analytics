you look down it's in your pocket it fell how yeah amen praise the Lord God is good amen praise the Lord Jesus am let's stand to our feet if we could amen we'll go turn over to Second Kings in our scripture reading seconds continue with the thought we had last weeken going Beyond the Veil part two amen Lord willing it um the way it looks now it'll be today and next Sunday see if how it works out that way Amen to finish this up the thing that the main part of the reason this came about actually is more going to be part three but um as I started looking at that part of it uh it kind of evolved from there to what became Parts one and now too so U anyway so 2 Kings 6 verse 13 we mentioned this last week uh I want to read it to begin our thought here for today amen so 2 Kings chapter 6 we we'll from there let's just bow our heads from a word of prayer from Lord Jesus so very thankful once again Lord of blessing us with uh this place this time Lord this service we thank you Lord that you're with us God and that you never leave us or forsake us thank you again for this precious word Lord in this message message that we hold so dear to our hearts thank you Lord for not just the letter of the word but revealing it to our hearts and showing us in here what you'd have us to see and know Lord because we know that you did it for us Lord it is us that you came uh to redeem those that were redeemable to reveal to those who could receive Revelation for those whose eyes would be open Lord and the veil would be pulled back so that it would no longer be a mystery Lord but it would be something that's revealed in the open to us yes to others it may certainly still yet be a mystery God but to those who believe those who have received God it is no longer a mystery it's no longer something that's in the dark it's been manifested and made known God we thank you Lord for showing it to us Lord for opening our eyes and for us Lord to be able to fall in uh uh be in your kingdom as a part of your plan Lord God we pray that you'd have complete control the main part of the service Lord God may you just receive the worship father unto you as a sweet smelling Savior and now as your word comes forth may you heal us Lord and strengthen Us by it God as you speak to us along the way let it be to us God as we commit it to you the purpose God that you've have for this service today all those that are here may be streaming God let it be as we commit it into your hands we ask it and pray in the precious holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask amen amen amen praise the Lord 2 Kings uh chapter 6 I'm just going to read one verse of scripture and then I'll let you be seated uh 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 17 read 17 and let you be seated and then go back over the story a little bit we mentioned it last week in passing about this but I felt to start here with this story reading it today so 2 Kings 6:17 and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elijah you can be seated if you'd like amen I want to read some more of the story if we can go back up to uh uh the 13th verse amen the king of Syria uh was upset uh of Israel was Waring with Israel and some unusual news today about Syria I guess uh Syria has been overthrown so the Syria of today I guess as things are changing in the Middle East still continuing to evolve continuing to change and you know if it's in the Middle East it's got to have some scriptural significance I can't say that I'm smart enough to know it all but um I'm it will unfold the way that God has it planned to unfold but at this day king of Syria Waring against Israel uh was was uh was upset with what was going on because Israel had a prophet in that day called Elisha and that Prophet knew all the things that God would reveal to him that was going on to be able to come against Syria and the king of Syria was mad about it and they said what are we going to do uh is it is there anybody that you know that uh that uh that uh is in this position that that is uh doing all this that that is giving us all these problems and and and they're like no King only one we know of is the prophet in Israel named Elisha this man is telling the king of Israel the very things that you're speaking in your bed chamber amen God knows no matter where you are no matter what's going on no matter what the situation God knows and if God knows he can show it to a prophet yes he can show it to any of us really but amen that gift of a prophetic gift God could show to him so God was revealing to Elisha the things that this King was saying in his own bed chamber amen so the king said let's go spy this out let's find out about this guy I want to bring him in here and I want to have a discussion with him so we'll start with the 13th verse amen the 12th verse uh talks about the servant said no my Lord oh King but elishah the prophet that is in Israel tth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber amen praise the Lord and he said go the the king of Syrian said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore sent hether horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early Gaza is this servant was risen early gone forth behold and host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him Al last ask my master how shall we do because all he could see was the enemy amen you know that's a sad state to be in Saint when it when as Christians we call ourselves Christians that sometimes it seems like all we can see is the enemy amen and we say God help me to be able to see the Promise help me to be able to see you not just the enemy we should never only focus on the bad we should never only focus on the wrong or the things that's happened that has been uh contrary or against never Focus always focus on Jesus Christ never have your eyes only on the enemy right never have your eyes only on the problem never have your eyes only on the circumstances have your eyes focused on the promise am have your eyes focused on Jesus Christ and the solution not the problem amen but all Gaza could see was the problem all he could see was the enemy that was Comm that was surrounded he said Master what are we going to do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than that be with them well I could say the same thing today amen more is with us than what's with them amen greater is the solution than the problem better is the answer than the problem amen greater Is God than all anything that hell could throw against you praise the Lord amen more with us than there are with them and again Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes now obviously his eyes were open man again we're talking about a veil obviously his eyes were open his natural physical eyes were open because you looked around and could see all the enemy around him that's why he went to Elisha and said Elisha we're in trouble they've got it the enemy has got us compassed around about what are we going to do so obviously his physical eyes were open that he could see but now Elisha is praying to God and said God lord I pray thee open his eyes what what part of his eyes was God to open to pull back the veil so that he could look into actually another dimension if you will to see all the horse es and Chariots of Fire round about as we just read the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha pull back the veil so he could see into that Dimension where all of the uh uh all of the uh uh horses and Chariots of Fire and angels all around about Amen to have them surrounded well if we keep our eyes focused on that then we can understand that there is not one thing that come against me there's not one weapon that can come against me that can prosper why because greater is he that's in Me Greater in he that is have us H uh compassed around about us and the angels of God all surrounding about us we know that's the scripture around about us amen they they don't go to lunch they don't have dinner they don't go out to eat they don't Slumber they don't sleep they're around you all the time yes your body your mind your thoughts everything about you amen so if God is there to protect amen with flaming swords drawn the white enemy can penetrate that it's what God has given us to keep us protected yes amen now that it didn't prevent the enemy from coming in because look we know what happened next when they came down to him now the enemy comes down but thank God gaz's eyes were open the veil was lifted back and he was able to see into the spirit realm uh outside of just the physical that was around now obviously all the enemy they didn't see those Chariots of Fire and all of the horse the mountains full of all the angels and Chariots of Fire they didn't see it if they had seen it they would have probably went back home right what enemy would not Retreat when their enemy when their adversary is outnumbered them 100 to one or whatever it was uh by a lot what enemy would not retreat they would have probably went back home so it was only that's the Prophet saw it and as the prophet saw he asked Lord let my servant see it and God opened his eyes and he could see it so that took all the worry away there was no more worry now gazel wasn't worried anymore least it doesn't say he was there's no more evidence that gazer was worried anymore when we know that there's more with us that takes the worry away yes there's nothing to worry about nothing to be threatened over concerned about amen cuz we know that more is with us yes God's going to make it all work he always does yes always will amen when they came down to Elisha now Elisha prayed 18th verse unto the Lord and said Smite this people I pray thee with blindness and he smoked them with blindness according to um according to the word of Elisha and Elisha said unto them this is not the way NE neither is this the city follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek but he led them to Samaria now look they it doesn't specify but I believe of that God dropped a veil over their eyes so that they would not recognize Elisha or recognize even their surroundings if you will uh if they had been smoked with physical blindness they probably would not have stayed they uh this wouldn't have been something that uh that that they would have done this is something that God smoked them with blindness so they would not know who he was right amen but notice as he led them he led them to Samaria amen away from where they were supposed to be right in the heart of the enemy right into a trap I mean really I if if he wanted to uh if they wanted to at that time the king of Israel and and Elisha said well now that you they just slaughtered every one of them if they wanted to amen because they were brought right in the middle of the enemy Elisha let them right in the middle of a of enemy territory if you will and it came to pass when they were come into Samaria that Elisha said Lord Open the Eyes of the men that they may see and the Lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold that they were in the midst of Samaria so they were so blinded that they didn't even know that Elisha was sending them into the heart of the enemy right because they didn't realize they were in Samaria until God opened their eyes and then they realized they were in the middle of Samaria so then the king asked and said uh the king of Israel said un Elisha uh when he saw them my father shall I smite them shall I smite them and Elisha is like no no no no don't do that amen men give them bread give them water feed them amen isn't that what happens when God says that to us about our enemies we're not supposed to speak bad of our enemies we're not supposed to uh do horrible harmful things to our enemy we're supposed to love our enemy yes we're supposed to pray for our enemy yes we're supposed to help our enemy when they're in need that's what we're as Christians that's what we're supposed to do and and when they came the the the king said shall I smite them shall I smite them and he answered Thou shalt not Smite them wouldest thou Smite Those whom thou H has taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their Master what kind of a testimony I'm not going to read the rest of the story you can read it if you haven't already but or reread it but what kind of a testimony would they have going back to the king of Syria if they can to the king of Syria and said you know we got there and we were at Dothan and we had the place surrounded but somebody we came up to wh whom they were looking for to take back God blinded their eyes took us in the middle of Samaria and you know what the King was there and could have slaughtered every one of us but they didn't even so much as Hold Us captive they gave us bread and water and sent us back here what testimony amen I when you when you think about a normal uh uh situation of adversaries enemies this does not fit that bill most people don't treat their enemies this way right and send those soldiers and those that were of Syria back to Syria back to their Master yes amen you want to have a place of peace that's how you do it amen a place of peace is to bring it together say well you know he could have killed us but he didn't yes but notice as I said said last week getting back to our subject as I said last week God God Veil God opened the eyes lifted the veil of Gesa took back the the the veil from his eyes to see into that other dimension to see those angels those Chariots of Fire around but then when it came to the enemy God blinded their eyes yes the same thing that opened Gaza eyes is the same thing that blinded the enemy the syrians the same thing blinded their eyes to see who Elisha was and even to the point of taking them into the middle of Samaria right the one that opened was the one that closed amen and and uh uh closed so the enemy could not see amen you think that's that same God could do the same thing for us today yes amen amen absolutely because God is still God yes God watches over us God is a good God now look again that the that Veil that God used remember we talked about Adam and Eve amen trading that Holy Veil for that lust Veil now God is showing that he unveiled the eyes of Gesa veiled the eyes of the enemy same thing God uses the same thing now um I want to go let me read this one scripture real quick um let me read two scriptures and then I'll kind of try to continue with my thought because I it's God's changing things up here so let's go to uh Matthew chap 11 I want to read one verse of scripture very familiar scripture reading Amen to to put what we're talking about kind of in continuity here in line but uh Matthew chap 11 uh one verse verse 25 Matthew 11:25 amen Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes you have hid it from the wise and prudent but you've revealed it unto babes the very same thing that closes the eyes of the unbeliever is the same thing that opens the eyes of the believer amen so the unbeliever can't see the very thing that the believer is looking straight at right amen an unbeliever and a Believer could read the same scripture and one can come out and say you need to be baptized in the father Son and the Holy Ghost and the believer will come out and say you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen because there's a revelation to the word to understand an unbeliever can take you and say now look I'll show you the script scripture there's there's one God there's two Gods there's three gods or an an unbeliever can actually come and say here's one God two Gods you know there's actually more scriptures to substantiate two gods and three Gods right but that's to the unbeliever they don't see the godhead is the truth you can go and you look at a scripture God reveals that whole scripture as you read through and you can look and you can see of course certain scriptures that it's just perfectly plain is the nose on your face that there's only one God yes that one God manifests himself in all of these offices to prove himself to to in whatever condition situation whoever it is Amen to us we know what he does and he sent his only son in the form of a baby in flesh that that flesh blinded the eyes of the unbeliever they couldn't see it right amen but it opens the eyes of those who do see it those that it's revealed to it's the same thing that opens is the same thing that closes right they look at it and it's closed they see three gods and they won't see anything else right we look at it we say how could you see three Gods right amen there can only be one yes and how many scriptures that we see that manifest the realization that there's only one God Amen well you just have to skip over that that's why they try to say well there's one God and uh uh in in uh three forms or three persons I think they say three persons but that one that those three persons is one person that doesn't even make common sense that doesn't even make natural sense much l scriptural sense that that makes no sense at all if you got three people you got three personalities you got three people right amen if you got one God who in him manifests all of the other attributes as Son and Holy Spirit and uh in MDC and in the in the power Pillar of Fire and the cloud and God manifests himself in many different ways the logos coming out of God the word of God coming out and manifesting in in in in the mzc and all the all of the manifestations that God has shown himself in those that are veiled to it can't see it right when God came to the pillar of cloud the uh to to Saul the men fell down but Saul worshiped God yes who art thou Lord right because he knew his the scales came off his eyes and he knew it could see a manifestation of the scripture of the Torah right there in front of him as that voice spoke to him I am Jesus who now persecutes amen amen the others heard Rumblings and no noises or whatever they heard amen Saul heard it God changed his name God blinded him right there physical blindness and took him in uh uh to be taken care of and nurtured and prayed for so he could pray and then God opened his eyes and he came out went he went into the darkness of Saul and he came out into the light as Paul right praise God the same God yeah amen amen amen was blinded but then revelated by the same God by the same thing those who don't believe the unbeliever is blinded to the things that you and I see because it's revealed to us and Jesus said I thank you Lord that you have hid it from the wise and prudent but revealed it to babes such as would learn there are eyes are holding to it they won't ever see it but now in Revelation in re ation especially in this age this age specifically unto the age unto the angel of the Church of L to see and write these things the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of God which is Jesus I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing in my doesn't that just it absolutely pinpoint this generation amen this age yes have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now there are blind people in the world today but there are far more people that can see physically see than what are blind so what's the blindness he's talking about that this l this leot and AG is stricken with spiritual blindness amen but Jesus said I thank you Lord that you've hit it from the wise and prudent they're blind to it can't see it oh how many places we find in the scripture that that veil has come on and how many places we find that God lifts that Veil that you can see it we see you look at the scripture friend when I read the Bible I don't find any way in this Bible that would that would constitute me baptizing in the name of the Lord in the father Son and Holy Ghost there's not one place right people said well Jesus said well that is true he said in the name amen K amen what about the guards that are guarding the gospels yes amen look it's not for everybody to see and not everybody's going to see it but he hid those things from the wise and prudent rich increase with Goods thou are wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked don't know it that's just it now today naked and don't know it now what does he say he says I counsel thee Le oia to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rainment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and what anoint thine eyes with isab praise the Lord that thou mayest see praise God anoint it with Isa so that you can see that's a proclamation to Le oia to be able to see the word God sent a prophet in this day people hate it people despise it people put it down people leave it ridicule it say he's a liar I believe it amen it's been it's been revealed God has shown it to me my eyes have been opened the veil has been lifted and God has revealed to me that truth and there's not one thing that anybody could ever try to say that would that would persuade me any different it's been revealed my eyes have been open right amen I can see Danny has a blue shirt on and there's nobody can tell me that he doesn't right you'll never convince me that he does not have a blue shirt on no matter what you say no matter what you do amen that shirt is blue Amen period amen God has shown me the truth and there's not one thing in there that you can see that God hasn't already revealed the only when I read it the only only thing I see is baptizm baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's only thing in there that's right amen amen the Lord Jesus Christ is the name of father son Holy Ghost which Jesus said yeah Jesus was so adamant about it that he gave Peter the Holy Ghost his own life living in Peter and he sent Peter out on the dead Pentecost to preach to the rest of them after after he gave him the keys to the kingdom of heaven Jesus gave Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven and he said whatsoever you bound on Earth will be bound in heaven now Peter steps forth on the day of Pentecost watch it Peter now be careful what you say because you've got the key and whatever you by now is going to be bound in heaven and Peter stood forth without reservation and said be you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost yeah praise the Lord you tell me that was that Peter was off with that having just received the Holy Spirit having just before that give that by Jesus own Direction given the keys to the kingdom of heaven or whatever he bound here be bound in heaven then they can't be a contradiction it's a contradiction to those that are blind yes it's a contradiction to those whose eyes cannot see they're not open that's why he said I adure you to buy me isav anoint thine eyes with isav so that you can see now let's go over to uh St Luke the same thing I I I I I gave this testimony again last week I believe it was last week that I remember I heard Billy Paul say it a couple of times but one time I think the last time I heard him give it was at the Tucson Tabernacle and he said that man remember youall remember when I get into the story had that book witness to that man and give him a guy who worked with I was give him I give him a book of brother Brandon he took that book home and he read it he brought that book back he was mad at that guy it was his friend mad at M said don't ever give me anything by that man again he said why not he said that man in that book called me a buzzard and he said well that's funny same man in the same book called me an eagle amen amen same thing that opened eyes is the same thing that closes eyes yes praise the Lord St Luke Chapter uh oh what are we at 24 St Luke chapter 24 the two men from emus let let's just start with verse 13 I was just going to read a couple of verses of scripture but I'll read through it because there's a point up here that I that I want to get we might drop down anyway 13 let's start uh Luke 2413 and behold two two of them went that same day to a village called emus about 6 and a half miles away which was from Jerusalem about 3 sare furong which about 6 and a half miles and they talked and they talked together of all the things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together in reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him so they saw him he was there with them they were talking together but their eyes were Holden they were captured the word Holden means that it was take hold of or to capture or to seize to seize hold of something Their Eyes Were seized Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them or veiled if if you will Their Eyes Were veiled that they so they could not see him amen could see naturally they weren't blind naturally but they were Holden spiritually to not recognize who he was amen and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have to one another as you walk and are sad and they explain all the things and he says what things now 25th verse let's drop down to the 25th verse then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into to his glory and at the beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scripture the things concerning himself explaining to them remember this scripture it tells about this that's me that's well he didn't say that's me but explaining it that this had to happen this was a fulfillment of scripture and and he began to tell them about this scripture and that scripture and this scripture this scripture it's got to come to pass well it came to pass this scripture had to come to pass it's came to pass and he be to expound to them all through the Torah all through the scriptures the things that concerned him they didn't know who he was of course at the time but the scripture to understand as hard as it was in as much as they and and I if it been me I wouldn't have wanted to Happ either had to happen it had to happen Jesus had to go through this this had to take place for the Fulfillment of scripture and as he expounded it to them look concerning himself they drew n to the village where they went and he made uh made though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying Abe with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to chry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave them to eat and their eyes were open why at that time were their eyes open why when he was expounding the scripture to them did their their eyes not come open amen now because the the scripture brings Revelation revelation of the scripture but it's it's the word the the spirit brings the Revelation brings the life it's the spirit that hits the word that makes it live amen so so why was this specific time the time that their eyes came open I remember brother green used to talk about how he how he would they would sit with him and he would take the bread and break it in front of them and they recognized how he did it was similar or was something that brought back to their remembrance well that's the way Jesus used to break it however tear it or pull it or however he broke I know that brother green would talk about that and that makes that that makes sense I kind of think uh it falls along the lines of breaking of bread when you break when the bread is broken it brings Revelation amen when it's open when it's manifested when it's made known when the bread is broken when it's made known and when it's revealed it becomes known to you then it's no longer hidden right then they could recognize who he was their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight he recogniz they recognized him after the breaking of bread after the opening of the word after the word was expounded to them he broke the bread and they and they and the Revelation came the the the veil was lifted when the veil was was lifted they could see who he was amen their eyes came open their spiritual eyes where they could recognize that's Jesus right amen this is him he vanished out of their sight but not before they recognized and realized this is him he was with us he walked with us he talked with us and they spoke to one another and said did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us and while he opened to us the scripture amen praise the Lord did not our hearts burn and that that's the way it should always be yes when Jesus is speaking to us it should always be that God is the Revelation that word is burning in our hearts as God reveals it to it as God shows us that Veil is lifted it's manifested and shown it's revealed the word he T that that because they specifically said when he opened to us the script scures amen when he opened to us now look it does not say as far as I know they did not have a Bible in their hands they weren't following along like we are here in church right they were just talking they were communing they were fellowshipping right Jesus is just starting to O open the scripture to them as he was walking along with them of the things that's in in the scripture do you not realize that so and so and such and such this is what it says and this is what it was supposed to do this day this scriptures fulfilled amen he didn't take a physical Bible and open it but as he preached and ministered the word it became re it became Revelation to them the opening wasn't a physical Bible the opening was the spirit revealing to them yes opening to them what the scripture and the revelation of that could you imagine and if they were sitting there and the horror of what they had just gone through and Jesus just being crucified in the manner he was crucified I you can't even imagine the kind of condition that human mind was in they probably didn't even realize or think about the scripture that said it had to be that way right and it was going to be that way right and but as you look at it you say well that had to be that way that that was a fulfillment of that now people can't realize that people today I you go and even ask to say you think it's the end time oh absolutely well you know at the end time God's supposed to send a prophet right really yeah you read Malachi 4 oh yeah Elijah is supposed to come well where is he if this is the end where is he people have no answer yeah because they don't know right their eyes are blinded to it but if God opened their eyes you could recognize and see that's how one of the families in Florida came started coming to our church they were moving down to Florida cuz her dad lived down there in St Augustine and a guy that came to our church worked for her dad and when they came uh and and moved to St Augustine he got to talking to them well while they were moving from I believe it was Michigan down to Florida um they started she they went to church up there they started talking her and her husband and and saying and reading in the Bible because their Minister had just been reading Malachi 4 and she looked said well where is that Elijah if we're at this end where is that Elijah right you see they didn't have an answer because the pastor didn't have an answer they didn't know but when they got to St Augustine they man a man met a man that knew right and that was the man that went to our church that was working for her dad and when they got together he began to tell when when they started talking about the story he began to tell her said I can tell you where that Elijah is amen and they started coming to church they're still message Believers today they moved back to Michigan but that I've contacted I've talked to uh a little bit since uh we left there and still still message believers good going to church praise the Lord because it just took someone that that scripture came and said this is the Fulfillment of that right and it opened their eyes to see yes that's a fulfillment of that now the religious of that day will look at it and crucify him and say he needed to be crucified they don't even come can't even fathom that this scripture that they knew so well right these religious leaders knew the scripture the Torah so well brother R said they could take a pen and stick it through the scroll which is round hold up stick a pen through it tell you where it HD and what it said amen they knew it that well right but when Jesus the Fulfillment of that scripture showed up in front of them their eyes they couldn't see Amen Let let's let's go over uh Romans I'm just doing this as it comes now so I'm skipping other stuff but Romans chap 11 vers 5 Romans 11:5 says even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace thank God for that and if by Grace then it is no more of wors otherwise Grace is no more Grace but if it be of works then there is no more uh Grace otherwise work is no more work what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded the election praise God God had to take the Wild Olive Tree grafted into the to the uh uh the the uh uh the old Olive Tree the Wild Olive Tree had to be grafted in so that the Gentiles would have a chance to receive the message to receive the truth amen for their eyes to be open for the scales to fall off and for that to happen the rest were blinded blinded to what to who he was amen they were as blind to who he was as the syrians were to who Elisha was they were just as blinded to it who did it they were just as blinded to re realizing who he was as the two going to amus did not recognize Jesus finally they did the two men in EMAs finally recognized who he was their eyes came open oh friend look there be a day when their eyes come open yes they were blinded here not to know him but their eyes will come open and when they do they'll recognize that they crucified the very Messiah yes my praise God but for now still now they're still blinded to it they can't they they couldn't see it their their eyes were Holden amen were they were they look looking for uh someone to ride down on a Pure White Horse with golden armor and and take and slew the enemy with with with a sword or something I mean what what was their Invision I mean Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the Son of God but when it happened when it fulfilled they couldn't see it amen they didn't recognize that was him he was the Fulfillment of that scripture Their Eyes Were blinded they had to be blinded so I could see so I could know so that it would go from the prophecy praise the Lord of Abraham CL Crossing his arms that at the cross the blessing would go from the older to the younger Hallelujah from Israel to the tame olive tree to the Gentile the Wild Olive Tree at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light yes the burden of my soul was lifted rolled away my eyes came open and I could see God removed the scale God removed the veil that we could see now their eyes are still Holden their eyes are still captive yeah amen captive to what they were looking that they must have been looking for something else so many times we miss things because we're not looking look at it right right we get things so fixed in our minds we get things so uh uh planned in our minds of how something's going to happen or how it's going to look or how it's going to be that when God does something we completely miss it amen we just let God do it and then whatever he however he does in whatever way he does praise the Lord amen amen I just want to be a part of it Lord open my eyes that I can see it so it can be something that's revealed to me amen that we become a part of that promise that word that he promised to us their eyes were whole they were veiled Their Eyes Were veiled they could not see it amen their Traditions look Jesus told them I won't read that scripture but Jesus told them amen you have made the word of God of none effect why what is none effect blinded null void Holden right you've made the word hold Holden why because of your Traditions your Traditions remember we talked about veils last week amen Church veils and Pastor veils and and uh brother Brandon veils and message veils religious veils denomination veils people use these veils all the time to try to uh uh to try to make things look okay I'm G to hide behind this veil of brother random and say I'm a message believer amen when your life's not right when your heart's not right when you're not born again but we're hide behind this message Veil right to try to make it look like I'm okay I'm a Christian I'm a believer I'm a message believer I'm a amen that's just a veil Saints and that's no more than saying I'm a Catholic or or or I'm a a Protestant or whatever it is hiding under this religious covering yeah we can't hide in a religious covering our relationship with Jesus Christ has to be number one first and foremost than anything Hallelujah regardless of what all the other is yes brother brandom had his but I have to have mine and you've got to have yours yes I have mine my wife has hers our children did not get ours they have their own yes and their children have to get their own praise the Lord amen God open our eyes that we can see don't let the Traditions the Traditions blind you to the truth like it blinded them in the scripture they've made they take they took a traditional Veil and blinded themselves from what was standing right in front of them amen I remember brother Ram talked about that that that messenger that went to go get Jesus when Simon put out the the uh the uh welcome to come to his house to this party um you're invited to come to this great gathering this great party of great dignitaries and important people you're welcome to come and that messenger brother B said oh my if I was that messenger soon as I come up to Jesus i' have fell on my face and weeped on his feet and said God forgive me a sinner amen he said this the messenger come delivered his message and walked away missed the opportunity amen oh God help us not miss that opportunity amen that flesh will will will create a a veil a problem the flesh is the veil I'll read a quote here but faith faith will help get you past that Veil amen we're coming up on the time that most of us the the world or whatever they celebrate Christmas probably a lot of kids growing up today don't even know what Christmas is probably don't certainly don't even know when Jesus was actually born but celebrating it December 25th that time but Jesus birth blinded so many people they couldn't see it amen how could the creator of Heaven and Earth lay on a manure pile after his birth my because he became humble like one of us he became human condenscending down into human flesh and that flesh veiled him from what for they could see that's why you know brother ramam said if this veil of Flesh would fall off you'd see God standing in front of you yeah not CA he's God because if the same thing happened to you I'd see God there yes amen it's the veil that keeps us from seeing him in that capacity it's the veil it's the veil of Flesh God takes that Veil off amen and it takes Faith to believe it takes Faith to see you the way God sees you amen I we see each other in our natural habitat as human beings but it takes Faith to look Beyond as God did for Gesa to look Beyond to see you the way God sees you yes Amen to see everyone the way God sees them God open my eyes praise the Lord that I may see Lord open my eyes I want to see yes it takes Faith to believe now look I read this I'm going close in he in the Hebrew series 1957 he said the veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in this church the veil is what keeps us from seeing the Angels at their positions this morning standing by the seats the veil is what keeps us from seeing him we're we're hid behind the veil and that Veil is the flesh we are Sons and Daughters of God we're in the presence of God the angels of God are encamped around about those who fear Him we're in the presence of God all the time I never lead thee I'll never lead thee nor forsake Thee I will be with thee always even unto the end but the veil is the flesh remember that is a veil but it's The Veil The Veil he's talking about now the veil of Flesh that's what keeps us out of the pre out of his presence but through the soul the fear our faith faith we know that he's watching us he's standing by us here right now he's going back to the story of of Elisha and gahaz he said down at Dothan one morning an old Prophet surrounded by an army of servants went I said oh Father the whole country surrounded by aliens and Elijah raised up and said why son there's more with us than there are with them he batted his eyes looked around he could see nothing he said God I would that you'd open his eyes take away the veil and when the veil dropped from over his eyes around the old Prophet was Chariots of Fire the mountains on fire the angels of God and the angels and chariots there you are Gaz could see amen he could say I see now praise the Lord the veil had dropped amen he said now brother B said now there's where the hindrance is so many times the hindrance is with the flesh yes with our flesh together our flesh me myself flesh again don't fixate on the wrong amen and trust me friend we all know this this is the wrong so don't get fixated on this yes nasty flesh yes amen don't get don't don't keep keep your vision on this nasty thing this is the wrong he is the right we keep our vision on him amen this is the hindrance Amen in us in one another that's the hindrance but God help us by faith to be able to see one another be able to see yourself be able to see yourself the way God sees you yes the way God sees each one of us praise the Lord amen oh we're all we're all animal Nature by by by Nature we were the children of Wrath amen our flesh amen not our nature anymore but our flesh amen animal flesh we are our our minds wonder and it the flesh wants to do everything that's against God but praise God there's something in there that tries that that works to keep control of that flesh amen so we don't we look Beyond this Veil look Beyond when you look in the mirror look beyond that Veil when you look at one another look beyond that Veil go beyond that Veil and see there's God God in each one of us yeah I've made my mistakes yeah I'm a human but look at that beyond that Veil don't fixate on the wrong fixate on the thing on the problems fixate fashen your eyes on the promise on the truth on Christ the word amen let that become your vision amen get beyond that Veil praise the Lord amen let's stand if we could amen Christ revealing himself to us making himself known he is amen our everything amen praise the Lord he's the lily of the valley he's the Bright Morning Star praise God e e e e e e e e e e
