streaming if you're on the streaming today appreciate each one just a few of us uh we had like as you heard so were prayer requests and needs that were mentioned those who weren't able to make it so let's please remember those prayer requests in prayer if you would and if you put them on text or if you put them on the facebook group page whatever it is we could look at it and continue to pray for it just uplift those needs before the lord today i believe that god will continue to move on them he is still the same yesterday today and forever he's faithful he's true he still gathers he still is present where two or three are there right amen so very thankful sometimes when you get text after text on a sunday morning that people are having troubles or people are not feeling well or something like that the devil tries to use that to bring discouragement but i'm so thankful to see your beautiful faces here this morning and i know that if you're not able to make it you're there streaming so appreciate you being there appreciate you being a part of the service don't know how long we'll be here although we may i may go into that afterwards my wife reminded me i need to make sure and keep track of the time uh because we are we are supposed to end at noon be out by noon i don't know if he rented it for the afternoon but that was our agreement so uh we just hold our agreement whether they had that uh done or not i don't know but we'll just leave that right now i keep forgetting i got a shelf here so i can put stuff down here uh it makes a little more room hey man but i don't know so we'll just see maybe if i have a few minutes left over afterwards we'll discuss that for just a moment but i won't i won't do it for very much or very long but uh if we do have a couple of minutes we might just do that but anyway let's go ahead as you're standing and turn in our bibles um and let's go to the book of exodus chapter 28. exodus chapter 28. exodus chapter 28 we'll just read the first few verses here before we let you be seated amen exodus chapter 28 we'll begin reading with a verse over the first verse but before we do this by our heads again for another word of prayer gracious father god we are certainly indeed grateful to be here lord and for this place that you provided for us today lord as brother john has already said god it's not the building that we're in but it's the people god it's the spirit it's that liquefier that each one of us brought today lord expecting you to meet with us once again father just as you did on the day of pentecost believing that your holy spirit will sweep through this place lord and touch every heart and life to fill every heart and life lord and to meet every need and to touch every strength and and strengthen every heart lord in every situation circumstance lord answer every question lord meet every need give direction leadership heal every sick body touch each one that's on the streaming lord bless them whatever the circumstance situation may be we thank you god that you're the ever present at help in the time of trouble in need god and we just thank you father for this time for this service for this place for those that have come today may your hand be upon us now lord as your word would go forth and speak to us from it lord and show us in here what you'd have us to see and know may it bless us and strengthen us in some way god that we can continue forth on this daily journey that you've given us god lord letting the life of christ the holy spirit live through each one of us producing the example that you left for us father in this holy word god that we could walk on this earth the same way you did lord expressing jesus christ the holy spirit through our moral beings god today thank you lord for all that you've done for us this week that you give us and health and strength and life in our bodies now and bless the reading of your word as we uh forward through this uh the rest of this service and rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hinder herder her infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the honor and praise for all that is said and done here today in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen exodus chapter 28 we'll read the first four verses here and take thou unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of israel that he may minister unto me in the priest's office even aaron nadab abide elazar ithamar aaron's sons and thou shalt make holy garments for aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted whom i have filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make aaron's garments to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office and these are the garments which they shall make a breastplate and an ephod and a robe an abroaded coat a miter and a girdle and they shall make holy garments for aaron thy brother and his sons that he may minister unto me in the priest's office you could be seated if you like amen i want to uh i wasn't sure after last week uh what maybe the lord would have for today but uh i wanted to just continue on the thought that we've had the past couple of sundays that'd be all right uh on the fitted garment and so the lord really this would be the fitted garment part three and uh probably be the last part of this uh but felt like this would be something that would be edifying and a blessing to to his children today and felt led to do it so we'll just continue on out we went through of course elijah elijah the mantle of prophet we've talked about extensively about the wedding garment the bride garment the word garment uh for this last day and how this bride is to be clothed in that garment and for that garment to make a make a consecration of her because of the word the consecration of the word and the word in her life and her becoming the word clothed in the word becomes a consecrated individual in themselves uh it goes back and think about the type and there's many of them through the scripture and there's many references to garments in the scripture uh there's very specific detailed uh garments through the bible if you if you look through the bible which i'm sure most of us have read all through it or most of it you notice that maybe and maybe you haven't noticed that garments actually play a very particular and large part of the bible in god's mind a lot of people think in the world today that it does god doesn't care what you wear well yes he does he's very specific about it too he's very specific as you could read here if god didn't care what we wore he would have left adam and eve alone when adam and eve clothed themselves with fig leaves they were clothed from the nakedness that they found themselves in when they fell into sin and that was appropriate enough in the sight of god god would have just left him alone if god wasn't particular about what you wear what the garments we have on our he would have just left them alone not done anything for them but that wasn't sufficient that wasn't what was pleasing to the lord so god made them garments himself he made them garments and he threw the garment into the bush now remember the garment that god made for them was a godly holy garment that god had done but he put it in their possession for them to put on and then he did not put this on them if you look at the scripture he threw it in and brother brown tells us in his dramatization several places and he threw those uh bloody sheepskin and then for them to put on they had to dress themselves so as god provides the material as god provides the the way and and what we know is right in his eyes it is still up to the individual that we dress ourselves it was it was up to them in the garden of eden to dress themselves it was up to this priesthood even though that god had given them specific instructions it was up to them to dress themselves it was up to uh uh well just all through the bible it was specific of course with elijah and elisha it was very specific in the new testament when you come into a wedding and you didn't have the specific wedding garment as as an invited guest would have on you were considered as the bible said jesus said a thief and a robber because you couldn't get into that wedding without the proper garment on but they had to have that proper garment and they had to dress themselves but they had to have the garment see if you don't have the garment you can't put it on right but if you have the garment you need to put it on and so there's the whole different thing that we understand of the holy spirit that comes in our lives the holy spirit the anointing is there and the garment is available but the person has to put that garment on notice last week when we talked about the holy spirit coming on the day of pentecost the holy spirit come and swept through that upper room maybe similar to this room today i don't know it was 120 of them so it's a whole lot bigger than this room but maybe similar swept through that room and that holy spirit come and it lit on each one of them and it went into them so it wasn't just okay for the garment to be there it had to come and be a part of them they had to put that garment on that garment had to be something that was uh the prominent part of their lives just like it always has been just like it was from the garden of eden all the way through the scripture it's a very specific thing that god has so it's very important we talk about the title of the fitted garment it's very specific it's very important through the bible and in god's eyes makes the difference one way or the other what what god desires to have for us to wear physically yes in our normal natural bodies but also spiritually what we wear now in the spiritual aspect of it so garments have played a big role all through the bible you look as if you go through the bible again this year some people start the bible at the beginning of each year and read through it at the they take the year to read through it and if you do that that's fine if you don't that's fine as long as you read the scripture but i want you to just pay a particular close notice over the next 6 8 10 12 months however long you're reading the bible and see how many references it gives it even talks about in let leviticus of the importance of the leprosy's garment the garment that lepers that lepers were to wear and and whether they were tainted or whether they were cleaned or whether they need to be burned think about um brother i believe it's brother biscuits testimony uh and i it just came to mind so i'm sorry about the details but uh there was a brother and sister that went on the hunting trip i believe when brother branham got the silver tip grizzly anyway their son always had epileptic fits and they prayed for him and they didn't know what to do for him and they did everything they possibly could do and brother branham said next time you go home he wears this specific shirt he said next time you go home and he and he has this bitter the man called his wife or something i think uh and please forgive me if i get some of the details wrong because the the gist of it is what i'm trying to get to but i'm trying to fill in the blank so it makes a little more sense but i believe he called to his wife said next time our son has that fit brother graham said next time he has that fit you take that shirt that he's got on and you take it off of him and take it and burn it and those and the the episode the seizures go away you don't think that that's important friend i mean how many without a profit or understanding those things would go tell somebody okay she actually went when he's having this fit if i remember the story right she had to actually jump on him and rip the shirt off of him she had because he was under he was out of control and she had to rip that shirt on him and take it and burn him immediately but the epilepsy went away she just stopped they quit because of a garment you might not think it's important friend but it's very important so much so let's continue to read this can we do that let's continue if anybody and if anybody's watching this anybody ever watches this if you don't think that it's it's important to god listen to this now we got the the fourth verse and all of these garments all these parts of garments are very important uh brother banh talks about i had them all written down here just before we continue on this uh the priesthood of course was to be hallowed and consecrated so once you understand and and keep that in mind as we go forward with this before we finish this because we'll get to that part obviously with the bride itself too that's hallowed and consecrated to the lord the garments now were to be holy garments now a holy garment is something that is set apart uh i looked up the hebrew of it and i couldn't dare try to pronounce the hebrew word but it means apartness holiness of course sacredness or separateness to be separated to be apart to be designated as someone or someone's that is a special called out to be what hallowed and consecrated before the lord taken out of just like brother branham tells us just like the scripture says the bride was taken out of a church why was the bride taken out of the church well the church put jesus on the outside knocking to get in so the bride had to come out because she's allowed him to come in her life the church has not the church has put him out so the bride had to come out of that revelation 18 be not partaker come out of her my people and be not partaker of her sin see so she had to come out to be howled and consecrated see to be set apart to be separate uh to be sacred the sacredness the holiness of it of course we get from the holy garment but the thing of that that i wanted us to get there was how god has called this bride out as a separate unique consecrated group of people holy yes uh uh sacredness but the apartments amen it's the whole thing that god calls us out of the world he calls us out of the church he calls us out of denominations to set us apart it's a it's a group of people it's god's wife amen it's god's wife and and uh men if you had a wife there's not many of us here uh of what we think about our wives and how much they mean to us and how much we chose that out of all the other wives in the world billions of women in the world we forsook for that one woman that we took into our bosom and took as our wife and you think about that just in a physical sense of what god's done in a spiritual sense for his bride and how much he loves his bride how much he wants his bride to be apart from the world to be separate from the world recognize what god did what did jehovah do with the with the israelite bride that he had espoused himself to to begin with he put her away for spiritual fornication because he called her out he called her apart from all the rest of the world he gave her everything that she needed and made sure that the traditions and all the things that they were to follow and live and do were separate from the rest of the world it made them look off of course made them look crazy silly why do you do that why do you act that way we went over that past couple of weekends but but but it showed them as a part but what did they do they began to marry themselves back up into the world again they were no longer no longer the separate group they were no longer the called out or apart group from the world and god put them away for their spiritual fornication because as they married themselves back up to the world again they began to fornicate god's word with man's idea and when they fornicated god's word with man's idea with man's opinion god put them away for spiritual fornication so what does he do this last friday he's telling this gentile writer this last day you are a separate group of people i have called you out i have ordained you i have called you to be a separate group apart from the rest of the world that's why you look different that's why you act different that's why you talk different that's why you go to different places or don't go to certain places that's why you're a separate group of people because i called you out of her to be not partaker of her sin amen that garment that god gave you now is that word garment that we stand holy consecrated it's a holy garment now and and aaron's garment now was to consecrate him but this garment i want you to notice now let me find it here this garment that that that they were supposed to make to them to consecrate him to minister the office it was supposed to be a garment of beauty it was supposed to be a garment of beauty but that beauty was unto the lord it was supposed to be a garment that they would minister to who not to you to him that's who we minister to we obviously do minister to one another but when we're ministering to one another who are we ministering to we're ministering to him i can't love him without loving you well how we're going to minister to one another how are we going to minister to this world if we're not ministering to him true that's why he said this priesthood is called out consecrated separate holy garments to minister where to me that's what god says so they can minister unto me in the priest's office that's why there has to be the place that god made the consecration that god had made and the garments that god had made but now look at this oh here it is of the second verse how shall i make holy garments for thy brother for glory and for what beauty amen for glory and for beauty well the glory is just the glory of god it's just a separateness amen of god is this it it is what we feel when the holy spirit comes into your life when the holy spirit and that anointing is on you you feel the presence of god that's the glory of god on you amen and that glory of god is exactly uh to bring the beauty of the holy spirit now this beauty is not a worldly beauty it's a godly beauty it's a beauty that that god is pleased with not that the world looks at you walk down some runway and half dressed or a third or probably not even a fourth dress anymore uh and show yourself off to the that's oh that's so beautiful no it's not that's a cankered sore friend in the eyes of god what's beautiful in the eyes of god is what's according to his word the properly dressed uh person the word dressed person the person that's dressed according to god's word in this last day amen it's very important i consider it important people in i i mentioned last week about uh uh this video that this man that we did the job for wanted to show me this church in colorado and the minister you know and a lot of the ministers today especially these big churches they like going to these big churches because you know the minister's all laid back and he's got flip-flops maybe shorts why and shirt or something and you know and he he tries to expound the gospel looking like he just okay i'm not going to say anything else looking like something i would not look like because i think it's very important yeah i come here dressed the way i do not because i'm a minister because i i understand the importance of what i believe that i'm giving to the lord this this is a part of my worship uh this is in my heart to give to the lord and that's why i do it different people dress different ways and that that's their choice and you give his unto the lord in your heart but that's why i do what i do amen i i think it's very important we don't come to god just uh just any old way uh wearing a rock and roll concert or something like that you know or uh just like a hobo in the street i don't even know if that's a term they use anymore that's probably not politically correct i don't really care but anyway uh you're not supposed to look like just i mean you if that's all you got that's fine right i mean that's perfectly fine if that's the best the person has that's fine but it's important that you give from the heart see and that's part of the worship now let's go you see how important it is and if people and if you're watching today you don't if we don't understand or see how important it is to god let's look at this let's start with the fifth verse now and they shall take gold and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and they shall make the ephod of gold a blue and a purple of scarlet and fine twine linen with cunning work now cunning work just means crafty it means uh uh you need to have somebody that knows what they're doing right it needs i forgot the the workmanship i forgot the exact word in there that that hebrew gives but it that that cunning just means that it needs to be a someone that's a workman it needs it needs to look good it's supposed to be crafted see yes y'all have the two shoulder pieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof and so it shall be joined together and the curious girdle of the ephod which is upon it shall be of the same according to the work thereof even of gold of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twine linen and thou shalt take two onyx stones and grit and grave on them the names of the children of israel six on uh six of their names on one stone six of their names on the rest of the other stone according to their birth according to their birth with the work of the engraver in stone like the engravings of a signal shalt thou engrave the two stones with the name of the children of israel thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold and thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder of the ephod for the stones memorial unto the children of israel and aaron shall bear their names before the lord upon his two shoulders for a memorial and thou shalt make ouches of gold and two chains of pure gold at the ends of wreath and work shalt thou make them and fasten the reed and change to the ouches and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work of the upon do i need to go on [Music] do you you see here we can finish the rest of this chapter and many of the other parts of the scripture how very detailed to the thread right right to the very thread that is in these garments of how specific god is making this now if you were to say oh well uh why uh it says onyx stones but let's just take a couple of carbuncle stones it won't really matter we'll just take carbuncle is a lot easier to find so we'll just take a couple of carbuncle songs and we'll just carve the names of the children of israel in there god won't care yes he doesn't he said make it onyx and that's exactly what he said and that's exactly what he meant anything less than that would have been displeasing to the lord he said gold purple scarlet uh blue oh well i i think red would look good well my favorite color is green well let's throw a little bit of no fine twine linen why cotton is good it feels more comfortable no no no find everything about this i want you to understand how important it is and people say well god's not in the details yes he is if there's anybody that ever was it's god right he cares to the very thread of this garment to the very thread now the seriousness of this and we can continue reading now brother the bible goes specifically into directions on the breastplate right the ephod the girdle the robe everything about it and each stone that's supposed to be in there and the names that are supposed to be carved on the onyx stones on the shoulder now all this has significance and meaning of course but that's another message uh that they carries on his shoulders with their names pointed up to heaven all six of all twelve of them six on one and six on the other according to their birth he they weren't even to just put down names randomly it had to be according to their birth amen because that was specific to god that's the way god wanted it that was his desire and if we're here to try to please the lord we're not doing this because we want to do it the way we think it should be done but that's exactly the way god people approach god today that's exactly the same attitude a lot of people have about being able to please the lord or going to church or reading the bible or translating the bible or something they have this idea that they can that that they can just do it however they think is okay it doesn't work that way people say well that's the old testament well then let's just take the old testament throw it away right it's also in the new testament but if you don't want to look at the old testament we can just throw that just throw that in the garbage and just forget about the old testament but understand that everything in the old testament is physically as type and shadow of mostly spiritually what happens today we know what the human thunder means today right we don't have the 12 stones above the breastplate the holy spirit is here right amen we know what the breastplate is it's still the same it's god but it's got to be pleasing to the lord amen now the seriousness of this reflects the seriousness of what goes on in this last day it reflects the seriousness of what's happening today because disobedience to god's word brings death and disobedience to god's word here brought physical death disobedience to god's word today brings spiritual death if anything if any part of this was off if the miter the girdle the coat the road the effort the breastplate in any of this to the very thread and color was off and that high priest tried to go aaron tried to go behind into the holiest place the holies of holies he dropped dead pray for them they even god even told them to put the pomegranates and the bells around the bottom of the robe i believe it was the road yeah the rope which was the outside garment which is strange because robe is out but the coat was the coat was actually an undergarment if you go and read it the coat was a tunic or an undergarment which today we use a coat as an outer garment usually but the robe was the outer garment and around the bottom of it was the pomegranates and the veils pomegranate bell pomegranate bell pomegranate bell and as you walk through there as brother branham talks about it he says when this man this high priest went in behind it to that hole as of holies that those bells had to ring holy holy holy lord god almighty as he walked into that holiest of places and if there was anything out of sword if there was anything out of place and what god had said that man would drop dead they put a rope they put a rope around him that when he went into that holy of holy place that if anything was off and he dropped dead they could pull him out with a rope because you didn't dare go behind that holy place if you went into that holy place you dropped dead too because it was had to be exactly the way god had orchestrated it to be that's how specific he is you look at this and see we can again continue to read this very god's very detailed about it very detailed well if he was very detailed about this uh uh uh this situation this this outer garment this uh this fleshly thing then what do you think that god is specific about his word and the revelation of his word today you don't think god's specific about his word today about the application of his word about the revelation of his word i mean he even tells his bride for this last day he even tells his people that we're not even cast our pearl before swine right right you know that the bible says that we are the the beautiful jewels and and precious gems and this uh uh great golden nuggets that god has given us that we are not to cast before swine right right to be trodden under their feet we're not supposed to do that now to witness to people that's all right to talk to people about it to try to encourage people that's okay but when people turn away from it and they deny it and they want to trample over it you just leave it alone right you don't push it you don't try to make it you can make things worse more than you can better amen that's why if i do something like that i try to feel led of the lord to do it there's nothing wrong if you just feel inspired or something you just think man i really want to talk to this person about the lord there's nothing wrong with that just be careful amen just be careful because you can make matters worse than better amen because i'd rather somebody have a chance to get in than to completely blaspheme the holy ghost and have no chance at all right yeah and because of sometimes it might be that you push it so hard that they blaspheme it then we've made it worse than better yeah but god is very specific about in this last day and his word and his word garment very specific about it that's why he uh that's why he went into great detail about it now there's a garment of course that a a an invisible garment that this bride for this last day is supposed to wear in ephesians chapter six we talked about this uh i went into great detail about all of this uh a year or so ago something like that but the whole armor of god ephesians chapter six verse um we'll just say verse 10 we'll just start with verse 10 here ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god now who's supposed to put it on you are i am we're supposed to put on our own armor put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore now what day is this that evil day what day are we living a very evil wicked day stand there for having your loins gert now i could i i have a message where i kind of compare these two but that that would take a whole another hour but just listen as i read through this to compare this with what uh god gave the high priest or the the priesthood dear that we just read in in exodus 28 listen now having your loin skirt with the truth having on the blessed the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god now that matches almost exactly everything god gave the high priest or the priesthood at that time the arianic priesthood for them to go into that holy place the girdle was a sash the coat was an undergarment the robe was an outer garment with the pomegranate's bells which covered the top part the ephod was a shoulder mantle uh outer garment that the that the breast plate was on the breastplate was above the girdle which the breastplate covered the heart the girdle covered the uh the uh reproductive area which uh having your loins gert it says here notice this having your your lawns gird about with truth well that's exactly what the girdle did the same part of the body all this covered and of course the miter was the helmet the headpiece that was the that was in the arionic priesthood that god asked us to have of course the the the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of god sword which is the word of course now that's the the the weaponry that we have to defeat the enemy is the word of god that word is what god gave us to destroy the enemy with now this chosen garment that god gave us now again a year or so ago whatever we went through this that whole teaching there uh of each part of that and what it meant and and we made some time i have before do the same with those uh priests garments the arianic priesthood every bit of it even to the the consecration of their garments and the consecration of their bodies to be washed and and and the cakes that were supposed to be offered and some that had oil and smeared and some that had mingled it every bit of it representing of course christ and that priesthood every bit of it had meaning signification so uh but lord willing we just go to that but understanding now how important this garment is how important these garments are to us you say well brother newton and why do we today you're talking about a priesthood you're talking about an arionic priesthood at that time which we're not even a part of the levitical priesthood anymore uh this this this bride the ministry this gentile ministry the last day is not it's a replication of levitical priesthood but it's not an example of the levitical priesthood or a following in of that we're not levitical priests amen but in first peter it tells us exactly so you say well that's just that's just you brother you know it's not it is not just for the priesthood today notice um in first peter first peter chapter two wherefore laying inside all malice and all god hypocrisy envies and all evil speaking as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be have tasted of the lord that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed in the god and precious ye also ye also not the priesthood not the ministers but ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house unholy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ that is for every one of us to do that scriptures for every one of us to fulfill a holy royal priesthood to minister amen to minister you may not stand up here and ever say a single word friend but you minister with your lives through the holy spirit and the token that's upon you every single day to have that token on display shows to the rest of the world who you are who you belong to what your life is like in a part of that's the holy spirit they might understand it in fact they probably won't they probably don't understand it they your old fashion or or or whatever they want to say but the truth of it is they're witnessing the holy spirit and they don't recognize it right they're witnessing the manifestation of jesus christ again and they don't know it a lot of them won't know it but it doesn't change the fact of what god is doing in our life right ministering witnessing our lives this uh this priesthood ministering to the souls that are in prison out in the world today and we offer up those spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ now what is acceptable by god or to god what's acceptable to god only thing that's acceptable to god is what's in his word it's the only thing that's acceptable to him anything else is not acceptable to god well i think i'll offer my degree or my lld or my uh uh thing that i did in college and i'll just offer up my my accomplishments and you know i i've got a doctorate's degree or master's degree or something and i'll just offer him you know what i think that i can give well that's the exact same thing kane did right came what he had was fruits and vegetables and that's what he tried to give to god without revelation of course then meant nothing to god god rejected it his countenance failed he killed his brother there's the result what'd it do brought death displeasing to the lord brought death now this was a little more indirectly but it brought death to abel but then god put seth in his place and raised up another one of course god told cain that his blood then spoke to him still still uh still manifesting itself so if we want to do something pleasing to god we need to make sure it's what he says is pleasing to him not what we think might be pleasing and again he's very specific about what he's pleased with wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed they were appointed to it but it stumbled at it when they stumbled they fail amen many are called okay many are called appointed few are chosen many are called fewer chosen understand there's a difference just like the bride being called out of the church brought out of the church but ye amen you you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation a peculiar people do you think you're peculiar people no yeah if you don't think you're a peculiar people look in that mirror i mean you'll find out real quick especially if you've seen all the things out in the world today how peculiar you are it's strange but you look at it you say and you get out in the world and you got hair sticking everywhere and all kind of colors and piercings and tats and tattoos and everything and drawers hanging down and uh everything and you think man those people are crazy you look over there's another one there's another one there's another one there's another one there's they're everywhere well you know what that means that means you're the crazy one not them in their world you're the crazy one right in their world you're the oddball so we're the odd ones you look at it say yes i'm peculiar and we are but we're supposed to be we're not supposed to follow in line with the rest of the world and the rest of everything else you take a lot of the churches out today you line them all up and you say well okay well i think she i don't you can't tell the prostitute from the other one right and vice versa and all about it there's no difference so well that that's a faithful car singer in our church okay well what's the difference the difference is many are coffee or chosen people love to do it but they do it on their own you can't do it right you have to do it we have to live our lives consecrated to the lord and where we're consecrated to the lord that means we are dead my opinions my thoughts my feelings the way i think it should be gone everything about every kind of a a a man's idea or opinion or dogma church tradition gone consecration means i do it by the scripture the way god asked for me to do it amen that's why you're a peculiar people a royal priesthood you are chosen by god amen chosen and picked by god as a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous life which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now i've obtained mercy we were heathens gentiles heathens clubs on our backs we weren't even a people but god called you when god called you he made you something it's the glass in the chicken yard when god called you took it out cleaned it up put it in service justification sanctification the holy spirit who did that that was god god picked you god chose you god's the one that set you apart clothed you in this holy garment so that you that you would minister to him and his priests in the in the priest's office as a priesthood you have this holy garment on so you can minister now so that we all minister to this world to this to this uh souls that are imprisoned we minister because of the lives that we live because of who we are because of who god has made us to be amen amen this whole armor amen let me see if i can sneak another one time runs out so fast uh revelation 19. revelation 19 chapter 1 we spoke of it briefly a few moments ago and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great core which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his saints at her hand revelation 13 and 17. amen and again they said hallelujah their smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped god that sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah notice that the four beasts also four and twenty elders fell but the four beasts right fell and worshipped god and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters the ministers the gospel going forth the the end time message and as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready she's made herself ready based on what the previous scripture has told us the voice of many waters the multitude coming forth the thunderings of the word the message the truth of god's word the vindicated worthy hour going forth and ministering to those people the justification that came in through sanctification to the holy spirit ministering by the word in a last day vindicated word prophet william brown to bring that word to a people now she's clothed in that word she has that word she has that word we got we got it on computers we got it on the internet we got on mp3s we got it on ipods we got it on books we got it in more ways than i could probably even think of right now but then what does that bride have to do with it it says the wife had made herself ready just like adam and eve did in the garden of eden just like these uh the aryanic priesthood just like those all through the scripture had to do you have to put that garment on you have to wear that garment let that garment show who you really are let it let it live through you because this isn't a physical garment of a bloody sheepskin or a fine twined linen but this is a garment listen that was granted to her eighth verse that she should be arrayed in that fine linen now it's i said not find linen but i meant literally tangibly fine linen this is a spiritual garment it is clean and white for the fine linen is what the righteousness of the saints which is what the righteousness of jesus christ which she has become because she's his wife the two become one the twain are now become one some of you may have noticed this got to close here in just a minute y'all may have noticed this you notice that tabitha i don't get off the street this right here this came from zach and tabitha's wedding i found it as we were cleaning up and there was thousands of these little things to have the hat all over the place uh some would call it litter but it was something that had been cut to made up his little hearts i don't even know what this is but i found one on their wedding day and i took it and i put it right here in my bible now i think it's matthew 20. if i remember right or it's right in there you know the scripture where it says whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder i took that there at their wedding and i found it and i went to that scripture and it sits there in my bible been there ever since however many years they've been married sets here you see it's freight on the end but if you ever wonder what that is sticking out of my bible that's what it is it just sits there where it says what god had joined together that no man put us under hallelujah god has joined together a bride he has married a bride if god has married a wife no man can put her away no man can divorce or take her asunder because the two have become one the twain flesh had become one he is the word well if she is his wife she is the word also if he is righteous she is righteous also and she has that wedding garment on to prove it and to live it so that that word manifest through her as the wife of jesus christ amen and let no man no man put asunder the two that have become one they cannot be divided they cannot be separated amen i was going to go you see in deuteronomy 22 most of you know that scripture it talks about the woman shall not wear a garment pertaineth to a man but i want to read this quote to you real quick there's a couple of places brother branham says this and um the one of them is recognizing your day is uh july 1964 and jeff let me read the rapture out of the rapture real quick because they're out of clothes here and the rapture yuma you probably all heard the rapture message in yuma uh one of the last messages brother brown ever preached there or preached period you should remember that night before i seen that i've seen the preview of the bride i stood there seeing a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed in things that beautiful lady correctly dressed was she dressed in marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision and i seen they said the preview of the bride i seen her go by they come on this side and went up around i heard it coming up the church was coming up from uh from this other side uh there come the asian church oh you talk about such a filth here come the european church oh my god and then i heard a rock and roll coming and it was miss america the church the church he talked about her being led by a witch now he doesn't say it in the rapture message but if you go back to recognizing his day it says she was led the the the last day this this uh a gentile of miss america was led by a witch a witch not now look this this isn't political friend this isn't the vice president or some body on some some woman on some talk show this is spiritual this is this is from the church not the bride this is spiritual a witch she's being led by coming up with a rock and roll she didn't have any clothes on she had a paper like a gray holding in front of her of course gray you know it's hypocrite not black or white just of course laodicea i stood there in his presence and i thought oh god as a minister if that's the best we could do you know how you feel then i thought god hide me if i could just get away from here all i've done and that's all that we can have to produce and then when them women pass by all doing all kind of rock and rolls and short hair painted faces they pass by like that supposed to be virgins to jesus christ then when she passed by like that i turned my head you know with this just holding that in front of me was disgraceful he said you know basically hiding himself from the back of them so he was just completely they were just naked from behind he said they were going on like that and i turned my head to weep like that and i just couldn't stand there to see that standing there we know uh that me a minister of a church and that's what i'd produce for him he said oh just let me die let me fade away and as soon as it went out every one of them would uh would come they would go out to a certain place and they would drop off and i then heard a sound as it as those went away and i heard a sound something like onward christian soldiers and i looked here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed hair hanging down their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the gospel she was the word amen of course what was she dressed in she was dressed in the word all correctly dressed beautiful i looked out at every nation i was looking back and passed by and seeing them instead of going down they started going up each one of the others was dropping off as they went off to the end this one as they went off to the edge of the vision they started going up they started going up and i noticed him trying two or three of them at the end he says of course you know at the end of that vision he said some up at the back of it he started screaming stay in line and he left the vision seeing he kept saying woke up in his room saying stay in line stay in line but notice that bride of this last day yes he talked about that at the end a little getting out of step a little bit but she's still a bride amen she's still dressed in fine twine linens clean and pure holy righteous without spot wrinkle or blemish which is the righteousness of jesus christ amen that holy garment that god has given us that holy garment that that is very very particular to the lord you're a royal priesthood you're a chosen generation saints you're a chosen people god has picked you out amen just think about this i'll leave you with this when you go to a wedding you've ever been to a wedding almost all the weddings i've ever been at in fact every wedding i've been at or officiated in you know who the bride is there can be a thousand visitors to that wedding but you know the bride amen how do you know who the bride is because of the way she's dressed amen because of the way she's dressed now some of these newfangled ones that they do and whatever i don't know what they do and they wear whatever they want anymore not sacred or to them but most of the time a wedding you'll know who you'll know who the brother the bride is amen just simply by the way she's dressed amen shouldn't have to give you her name or anything else you might not even notice the bridegroom might be a lot of tuxedos around but there's only one bride yeah amen one bride and she's called out she's separated and you know who she is no guesswork amen think about that invisible union that's taking place between christ and his bride right now because it didn't say you were going to be it says you are amen you are right now amen the righteousness of jesus christ amen praise the lord god bless you today let's stand if we could amen i'm so thankful god so merciful loving kind amen let's sing that uh of course zach was singing here a little earlier 685 something beautiful [Music] we were a mess saints god made something beautiful out of us good all my confusion he understood [Music] now something beautiful something good on my confusion and all i had to offer him was [Music] brokenness how did he do that by mercy rewriting our lives amen mercy rewrote our lives praise the lord jesus made something beautiful out of us today amen i'm so thankful amen god's so good to us isn't he praise the lord god richly bless you today appreciate you coming and being here appreciate you streaming if you stream today you're archiving god richly bless you remember the prayer requests and all that we have before the lord and believe that god is mindful of every one of them amen who's part of her request i know sister julie didn't mention it but she has a very urgent request that she would appreciate each one of you keep it in prayer for her as well so amen so god richard bless you today appreciate you coming and being here so god is good i'll let you know where we're going to be week to week we may stay here the man asked me if we were going to stay here i said well i'm not sure um originally when i came in it's like 350 dollars for the room and i said well we only need it for a couple of hours and he said 175 and then we're standing here talking and talking and he knocked 25 off to 150 and i thought well you know that seemed okay because that's basically what we were paying at the other place six hundred dollars a month really 150 a week but then i called every hotel all the way from torterro every hotel on the interstate all the way down to about right here i didn't want to go any further south no offense but most of the hotels just south of here not nice places so uh i knew the days inn had one but it's kind of small so i called all of them they either didn't have one uh root red roof was closed down for kovid uh they were way too much some were 450 dollars um one lady lied to me up on cortero uh initially the room was available and uh and then when i told her what we were doing she said hold on a second she came back said no the room's not available anyway uh which is okay uh i checked around tucson malls two or three hotels and going forward anyway so i called back uh friday afternoon and told him here that we would take this and he said okay well then he said we'll be 125. so i'm assuming that we paid 125 for today and at 125 i probably willing to just do it for the next few weeks uh i saw brother uh brother roger brother john yarborough friday and we called the realtor the other place while we were sitting there and they got an agreement on the air conditioning unit for their place but they're still trying to work something out with marana because it's 2400 square foot space and there's only one bathroom steel only one bathroom a lot of these places they're they're decent prices to get into but for a church like this they almost all of them only have one bathroom so it can be a complication uh with a bigger space so they're trying to work that out they're trying to work out an agreement with the landlord uh on the price but he doesn't think that's going to be a problem and once that's done and they get the air conditioner put in then we can move in that's so it but it may be another month or so before all of that happens but it's in the hands of the lord amen so whatever his will is i found out the building on first avenue is about four thousand dollars a month would be perfect uh but uh that's just a bit more than what we can afford so uh but there's like 20 25 parking spaces that's freestanding building it's i got two bathrooms big open space in the middle and but anyway um so it looks like that i'm still keeping my eyes on that one so um so just keep that in prayer if you would and um and we'll just i'll just let you know during the week war will be next next uh next sunday brother dennis have been talking to somebody out on wrightstown road if y'all know where right town road is it's halfway between here in new mexico that is offering us one of their buildings at their church to go into so we'll see we'll see what the lord does so i appreciate you coming to be here today but uh uh appreciate him most of all yes so just remember that prayer if you have any questions or anything just let me know amen appreciate uh appreciate the lord blessing us with that so amen god bless you today brother john would you dismiss us in prayer sure amen heavenly father thank you lord god for your precious word lord thank you for speaking uh to us lord through brother ben lord the timing lord god is always perfect that just shows us that is you lord god you're real you're with us lord god and we just thank you for showing us the way and you're helping us lord by your spirit lord god thank you to take that away lord to heal to humble ourselves to it after hearing that god and we thank you lord once again for this little place lord god and for our pastor lord his love and his zeal for you lord god and the blessing that you put in his life lord to bring your word the way uh he does lord god and how he gives himself to you lord god we appreciate that father we'll just give you all thanks honor and glory lord and may you keep us lord until you bring us together again lord god in jesus christ's name god glory and honor amen you amen and don't forget your mask when you go through them i heard a man's voice but we were singing right there and i thought brother john because i thought maybe the echoes came in he was singing beautiful night i believe it was the angel amen praise the my lord was singing yeah i heard him praise the lord amen glory to god amen wonderful praise the lord [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] they usually put out water
