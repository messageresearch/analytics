[5:07] you do thank you for the lord you said
[5:09] paul said he forgot everything that he
[5:11] knew that he might know you are yes lord
[5:14] and i say that's your call lord god for
[5:16] us to forgive just forget it
[5:18] forget what you knew and how you are and
[5:21] what you can do just forget it
[5:24] your prophet said lord god we
[5:26] come and we print our present ourselves
[5:28] as empty vessels yes and see what you
[5:32] are willing to do with this yes lord how
[5:35] do you
[5:36] choose to fill us yes lord and lead us
[5:39] our god thank you god help us to take
[5:41] that attitude lord it's it's it's
[5:43] wonderful it it opens the gates of
[5:45] heaven lord god
[5:47] makes room for your spirit to do
[5:49] whatever it wants to do
[5:52] thank you lord your mind your thinking
[5:54] lord your desires your ways father yes
[5:57] you don't understand them all lord god
[5:59] uh
[6:00] you said you know we
[6:02] we're
[6:03] we're in these uh
[6:05] pest house as the brother was saying it
[6:07] yesterday
[6:08] yes brother bennett or the other brother
[6:10] that spoke
[6:11] uh
[6:12] that you
[6:13] it's hard for us to do
[6:15] what you would have us to do yes because
[6:18] we have opposition
[6:20] yes help us you know the enemy tries to
[6:22] make us think that yes we're no good
[6:26] you may as well give it up
[6:28] god hasn't called you he hasn't chosen
[6:30] you
[6:31] that's not true lord god that's just the
[6:34] part where satan can
[6:35] dally around in and discourage us in
[6:38] lord the flesh
[6:39] the works
[6:41] of the flesh the works the laborers of
[6:44] the flesh but as you showed me this
[6:47] morning lord i'm sure you've showed us
[6:49] all
[6:50] but the fruit
[6:52] that stood out to me this morning the
[6:54] fruit of the spirit i said wait a minute
[6:58] the works of the flesh
[7:00] thank you doing something you're putting
[7:02] forth the toil and effort such as
[7:04] keeping the law
[7:05] trying to work it out yourself but he
[7:07] said the that's the works of the best
[7:09] but the fruit
[7:11] of the spirit in that word stood out
[7:13] this is fruit fruit can be plucked
[7:17] from the trees
[7:18] it's something that's chosen
[7:20] even like a catching away
[7:23] when god catches his children while he's
[7:25] plucking that fruit
[7:27] out from the earth there's no work it's
[7:29] a fruit
[7:31] people want to eat from that tree yes oh
[7:34] my there's such a difference lord god
[7:36] and you bring forth that fruit lord god
[7:40] in your time in your own way no works
[7:44] works of the holy spirit but it's your
[7:47] fruit lord it's your life that does that
[7:49] yes not us
[7:51] lord we appreciate you father thank you
[7:52] for showing yourself to us lord yes for
[7:55] filling us all with your holy ghost lord

[20:46] the generosity and
[20:48] uh the helping hands that came forward
[20:50] to help her during his time
[20:52] from my dad and um it really amazes me
[20:55] to know that god is
[20:57] that he's so mindful of us for every
[20:58] little detail just anything and i'm
[21:03] each and every one of us
[21:05] have something to do to to lift each
[21:07] other up and it's just amazing amen and

[21:11] many things that could i could see that
[21:12] have happened
[21:14] um during this time
[21:16] and uh
[21:17] i know i didn't share a lot really
[21:19] yesterday and um
[21:21] i do have a
[21:23] quick little story that i wanted to
[21:24] share about my dad and i shared
[21:26] yesterday but um
[21:29] it was basically my dad
[21:30] because one of it he really loved to
[21:33] make people laugh and smile and and um
[21:36] feel good you know
[21:38] come on come on
[21:39] he's okay i'm good right here okay
[21:42] sorry
[21:46] [Music]
[21:55] my mom and my dad one day were at
[21:56] walmart and uh

[22:51] basically you know that he was he was
[22:52] bad all year so he wasn't getting them
[22:55] and made my dad just feel really good
[22:57] you know and it's just amazing because
[22:59] even the little mindful things even
[23:01] though we know the truth of that you
[23:02] know
[23:03] he made that little girl's day and it's
[23:06] how my dad was and he was always he
[23:09] loved music he loved songs i told the

[23:18] here
[23:19] and and and my mom has seen it and
[23:23] you know and i praise god because she's
[23:25] now sitting here with us

[39:33] we just might as well go back to

[39:36] fellowship because without him
[39:38] amen even without him and our fellowship
[39:41] what good is our fellowship
[39:42] amen but we're thankful that the god
[39:45] promised that he would be where two or
[39:47] three are gathered in his name
[39:49] amen and friend we didn't come in the
[39:50] name of a church a denomination or a
[39:53] pastor we come in the name of the lord
[39:55] jesus christ
[39:56] and name that's above every name amen
[40:00] praise the lord jesus god bless you
[40:02] appreciate each one of you coming being
[40:03] here today in the house of the lord amen
[40:06] thank the lord for his goodness to us
[40:08] enjoy this memorial service yesterday
[40:10] believe it was uh of the lord i believe
[40:12] it was a
[40:14] a blessing to the family and
[40:16] i know what helped me and
[40:19] it's just
[40:21] has to do with a lot of
[40:23] settling in your spirit you realize some
[40:25] things you don't understand or realize
[40:28] that's going on
[40:29] it's the time we we understand all the
[40:31] things that affect our flesh all the
[40:33] time but you know the things that affect
[40:35] our spirit a lot of times we don't it
[40:37] doesn't register real true or right away
[40:41] but you realize maybe later on that you
[40:44] know an event something like that
[40:46] yesterday just kind of gives a little
[40:48] closure right it helps you be able to
[40:50] move on it helps you be able to go
[40:52] forward
[40:53] and realize that the lord has me here
[40:56] for a purpose and
[40:57] fulfilling whatever that purpose is is
[41:00] what the lord called in my life so in
[41:02] our lives and what we do and that's why
[41:05] a lot of times we do what we do
[41:07] amen it's obviously to commemorate
[41:09] someone like brother angel and his life
[41:12] and what he meant to so many people and
[41:14] but it also has everything to do with
[41:17] with the alive and remain the people
[41:19] that are still here and still living
[41:21] through this life and day to day making
[41:24] it to the glory of the lord the best of
[41:26] our abilities amen
[41:28] praise the lord like mike is saying a
[41:30] lot of may sound look like
[41:33] huge mountains when you approach them
[41:35] amen but once you look at it from god's
[41:37] point of view
[41:39] actually uh i like the words on this on
[41:42] the song because uh it's it
[41:46] you know it's
[41:47] it's very energizing and
[41:49] it helps you but actually if you go to
[41:52] if you've ever gone to google earth and
[41:53] you looked at it from straight down it
[41:56] doesn't even look like a hill it's just
[41:57] flat
[41:58] it's not even a hill from heaven's point
[42:00] of view it means nothing from heaven's
[42:03] point of view amen it's just straight
[42:05] and solid and flat and narrow and
[42:07] amen
[42:08] the place and the way that god provides
[42:10] for us so amen appreciate those of you
[42:13] who came yesterday i was part of the
[42:14] memorial service if you didn't see it
[42:16] you didn't stream it uh it is archived
[42:19] on youtube and on our webpage so if you
[42:22] do want to see this on our website and
[42:25] youtube if you'd like to view that
[42:28] in at a future time so
[42:30] amen so god bless you i enjoyed uh the
[42:33] songs and um we're gonna have our
[42:35] communion service this afternoon so
[42:37] we'll just get right into the word here
[42:39] uh if you'd stand to your feet if you
[42:41] could one more time
[42:44] we look in our bibles first
[42:45] thessalonians chapter four
[42:53] first thessalonians chapter four
[42:56] sorry about that i'm like got to get
[42:59] used to that
[43:01] amen we're going to
[43:03] keep using the mic i got to get used to
[43:05] turning it on
[43:06] kind of i've been preaching so long
[43:09] without a microphone and
[43:11] you forget that the microphone actually
[43:12] has to be on before it amplifies the
[43:16] only way it works right so
[43:18] i just i got to get used to doing that
[43:21] so my apologies i know you've probably
[43:23] all heard me well enough but um
[43:26] but it's it's for
[43:28] amplification now but it's also for the
[43:31] camera uh sound goes in the camera for
[43:33] the streaming so that uh it it can
[43:36] hopefully be heard a little bit better
[43:38] when it's streamed and when it's
[43:39] archived and by the way i would i would
[43:42] like to say how much i appreciate
[43:43] brother roger collins for
[43:46] loaning us the equipment the sound
[43:48] equipment for we can have for this
[43:50] memorial service yesterday so it really
[43:52] made a huge difference in a lot of cases
[43:54] to be able to have uh
[43:56] voices amplified and we actually got to
[43:59] hear the precious sisters sing yesterday
[44:02] because they amplified and you could
[44:04] hear their voices
[44:05] so i appreciate brother roger loaning us
[44:07] the equipment it's not ours so
[44:10] um
[44:10] shall i say don't get used to it maybe
[44:12] but uh i appreciate brother roger
[44:15] loaning that to us before we could have
[44:17] and so we added up for memorial service
[44:19] yesterday so we'll just keep it up for
[44:21] today and uh
[44:22] see where it goes from there
[44:25] but i appreciate brother roger loaning
[44:26] that to us so
[44:28] amen before we read the word we just bow
[44:30] our heads for another word of prayer if
[44:31] we could
[44:32] precious lord jesus we are so very
[44:35] thankful father of your blessings and
[44:37] your love and your mercy and the grace
[44:39] that you give every day lord expecting

[44:49] done here today
[44:50] truly lord every one of us here lord are
[44:52] insufficient to the task ahead the lord
[44:55] were believing god that you would come
[44:57] and speak that you would come and listen

[45:02] control of every facet of this service
[45:05] and every person that is here in every
[45:07] way speaker here

[45:49] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[45:51] pray amen
[45:53] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[45:57] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[45:58] brother concerning them which are asleep
[46:00] that you sorrow not even as others which
[46:02] have no hope for if we believe that
[46:04] jesus died and rose again even so them
[46:06] also which sleep in jesus will god bring
[46:08] with him for this we say unto you by the
[46:11] word of the lord that we which are alive
[46:12] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[46:14] shall not prevent with them which are
[46:16] asleep
[46:17] the lord himself shall descend from
[46:19] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[46:21] the archangel the trump of god the dead
[46:23] in christ shall rise first then we which
[46:25] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[46:27] together with them in the clouds to meet
[46:29] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[46:32] be with the lord wherefore comfort one
[46:34] another with these words
[46:36] you can be seated if you'd like
[46:39] amen we uh also like to mention we had a
[46:41] really good time of service here
[46:42] wednesday night uh felt the presence of
[46:45] the lord really strong and enjoyed
[46:47] brother benny perry and his ministry
[46:49] what he had to say to us a very
[46:51] challenging wednesday night and
[46:53] encouraging and blessing and of course
[46:55] the group that you brought with them and
[46:56] the songs they sing and just uh just
[46:59] felt a little more a little at home
[47:01] there uh like because they're from south
[47:04] carolina so
[47:05] uh just
[47:07] felt like uh one of the old revivals i
[47:09] used to go to a little bit but enjoyed
[47:11] the service here wednesday night enjoyed
[47:13] brother vinnie coming and we again that
[47:15] just was the first wednesday night we're
[47:17] gonna continue to have wednesday night
[47:19] services seven o'clock so you can make
[47:21] it now we just had the same scripture
[47:24] reading i i won't uh
[47:26] be too long today since we're going to
[47:28] go out get a bite come back uh around
[47:31] three o'clock today so we'll just see we
[47:33] maybe cut this short around 12 inches so
[47:36] just having the lord leads but trusting
[47:38] his uh
[47:40] uh his leadership in this but uh i want
[47:43] to speak on today the fact that um the
[47:45] catching away or the rapture is not a
[47:49] unique concept it's nothing new uh we
[47:52] talk about it often and again like we've
[47:54] said before we talk about it in the
[47:56] context that this uh great supernatural
[47:59] event that's going to take place i
[48:01] believe is taking place but it's going
[48:04] to culminate with the changing of our
[48:05] bodies is is is going on now but it's
[48:09] not something that's new it's not
[48:11] something that's different uh there's
[48:13] been uh several raptures if you know
[48:16] that's already taken place in the bible
[48:19] you know there's four raptures that we
[48:21] know of scripturally precedent that that
[48:23] has happened in the in the bible already
[48:26] we've mentioned them a few times as
[48:28] we've gone along through this uh study
[48:30] this is the rapture part 16 by the way
[48:33] but we've talked about some of those and
[48:35] we've kind of hit some of the highlights
[48:36] but i want to explore some of them a
[48:39] little bit deeper if we will and kind of
[48:41] take some of what brother branham
[48:42] mentioned in the rapture message if you
[48:44] ever listen to the rapture message or
[48:47] maybe at least since we started this
[48:48] series uh that you've listened to the
[48:51] rapture message and uh it's kind of been
[48:53] 17 parts to something brother branham
[48:55] condensed into like an hour hour and a
[48:58] half but uh a lot of a lot of other
[49:01] things that brother branham is is is
[49:03] like those mountain peaks you know that
[49:05] uh spell out his name brother branham
[49:07] just kind of hit this top here and he
[49:09] skipped and hit this top here and he
[49:11] kind of skipped and hit this top here
[49:13] but there are so many other underlying
[49:15] things in the scripture that could go
[49:17] with every one of the points that
[49:19] brother branham made in that period of
[49:20] time and i trust and pray that's kind of
[49:23] what we've tried to do is go into a
[49:26] little more depth into each one of those
[49:28] subjects and each one of those points
[49:30] and parts and things i'm sure brother
[49:33] branham would have liked to have said
[49:34] about the rapture but just didn't have
[49:36] the time right you know brother branham
[49:38] uh in that uh in yuma there when they
[49:40] had that banquet room like
[49:43] 30 minutes into his message a woman was
[49:45] coming through apparently telling him to
[49:47] leave
[49:48] uh you hear brother branham on tape
[49:50] saying oh they want the room they want
[49:52] us to leave we need to hurry and he
[49:54] spends another 45 minutes
[49:56] preaching uh it was not nothing was
[49:59] going to stop that not even a woman back
[50:01] there pointing at her watch and say
[50:02] hurry up we got to get the room for
[50:04] somebody else he kept going but i'm sure
[50:07] there's probably other things maybe that
[50:09] we've explored that he may have had even
[50:11] in his notes or something because you
[50:13] know after that he went to california
[50:15] and he spoke some on the rapture over
[50:17] there and hit some of the highlights
[50:19] there too so but we like to just try to
[50:21] since we a pastor and we have the
[50:24] opportunity and the the services to do
[50:27] it we uh just like to try to take and
[50:30] take it maybe a little bit deeper and
[50:32] maybe even read the scripture about each
[50:34] one of those
[50:35] the very first rapture that we know of
[50:38] recorded than the bible was does anybody
[50:40] know
[50:42] enoch
[50:43] enoch's the very first rapture that was
[50:46] recorded in the scripture so if we go
[50:48] back to genesis chapter 5 we've talked
[50:50] about enoch
[50:52] because of the days of noah and we've
[50:55] talked about
[50:59] the script and we have read this verse
[51:01] of scripture but i want to read it again
[51:04] noah uh uh enoch being that
[51:08] that we find the scriptural precedent of
[51:11] rapture i think it's very important uh
[51:14] to reiterate to read over again because
[51:17] of the significance of that one verse
[51:21] it is genesis chapter 5
[51:23] of verse 24
[51:26] genesis 5 24 and enoch walked with god
[51:31] that's the significant part to remember
[51:34] again a few weeks ago we talked about
[51:36] that and the significance of and what
[51:38] that testimony was that enoch had that
[51:41] he pleased god because when god recorded
[51:44] enoch's rapture in in hebrews
[51:47] it was recorded as that enoch had a
[51:49] testimony that he pleased the lord amen
[51:52] so we acquainted and understood that uh
[51:55] a testimony that was pleasing with the
[51:58] lord is somebody that was in the old
[52:00] testament that walked with god
[52:03] the only way to walk with god is to be
[52:05] pleasing to god yeah if god is in a is
[52:09] in a place and there's a holy spirit you
[52:11] know brother adam said when that dove
[52:14] tries to come down and a wolf nature
[52:17] tries to take over that dove will take
[52:19] his flight right yeah that double leaf
[52:21] it's not going to walk or dwell with
[52:23] anything that is not according to the
[52:25] spirit of god in his word
[52:27] so for someone to have the uh a
[52:30] testimony that they walked with god that
[52:34] meant that their life was pleasing to
[52:36] the lord yeah and that is a great
[52:38] testimony to happen
[52:39] and that testimony is going to be
[52:41] something that's going to ring true in
[52:43] heaven it's going to read true with god
[52:45] and of course it's going to
[52:47] find its effects on the earth
[52:49] every christian
[52:51] and every christian today
[52:53] should be in the place in their heart
[52:55] life
[52:56] where they want to desire to
[52:59] walk with the lord and have a walk with
[53:02] the lord
[53:03] because as enoch walked with the lord
[53:05] now it didn't happen with everybody else
[53:08] that walked with the lord as we found
[53:10] out the bible also said that noah walked
[53:14] with god right he got and noah found
[53:16] favor so with god but god had a plan for
[53:20] enoch
[53:21] and god had a different plan for noah
[53:23] right you understand
[53:25] they were both children of god as we'll
[53:27] say but one god took home in a rapture
[53:31] to bring a type
[53:33] and one god took over a tribulation
[53:35] period as a type but both men walked
[53:38] with god right but we know as him being
[53:42] the seventh from adam according to the
[53:43] scripture
[53:44] that the seventh church age that type of
[53:48] the seventh church age who was to walk
[53:51] with god would also be the ones who take
[53:55] that rapture
[53:56] now this was just one man you know it
[53:59] was just one man but it was the it was
[54:02] the
[54:02] the types and the shadows of the old
[54:05] testament
[54:06] showing us what was going to do in the
[54:08] new testament now a lot of times
[54:11] unfortunately especially in the
[54:13] christian world especially when people
[54:14] don't understand it or can't explain it
[54:17] or teach it they try to do away with the
[54:20] old testament oh well not in the old
[54:22] testament anymore friend we don't live
[54:24] the law anymore saints
[54:27] what we do is we live by the dictates of
[54:31] the spirit that is within us
[54:33] if we don't live by the law anymore we
[54:36] might as well go kill and steal and all
[54:39] the other ten commandments do we not
[54:41] still obey them
[54:42] yes we absolutely live them but it's not
[54:46] a law
[54:47] it's a life
[54:49] there's a difference in obeying a law
[54:52] and living a life
[54:54] when you get the holy ghost living by
[54:57] the dictates of god's word becomes a
[55:00] life not a law
[55:02] so it's not a law to us anymore people
[55:05] say oh that was the law we don't live by
[55:07] the law yeah but you live by the holy
[55:09] spirit that is in you that is going to
[55:11] cause you to live by all the word of god
[55:15] you don't get to pick and choose amen
[55:17] you don't get to say oh well we don't do
[55:19] this and we don't do that or well this
[55:21] is okay well this doesn't really matter
[55:23] anymore now obviously some things have
[55:26] have evolved if you will
[55:28] because jesus said that god didn't come
[55:31] to do away with the law he come to
[55:33] magnify the law how many knows that that
[55:36] jesus came to magnify the law he said uh
[55:41] the old the old testament says thou
[55:44] shalt not commit adultery but jesus said
[55:46] i say unto you he that is looked upon a
[55:49] woman to lust after her has committed
[55:52] adultery already in his heart that is a
[55:55] magnification of the ten commandments so
[55:58] it's magnified itself i had somebody
[56:02] asked and even challenged brother dennis
[56:04] one time well
[56:05] we don't we don't live by the old
[56:07] testament uh do you still sacrifice
[56:10] you do i said i don't raise animals and
[56:12] go slit their throat on on an altar
[56:14] somewhere but i am continually offering
[56:17] up spiritual sacrifices to the lord
[56:20] jesus with the praise of my lips
[56:24] sacrifices all the time
[56:26] spiritual sacrifices they just god just
[56:28] it just magnified itself to us

[57:22] sincerity of people's worship's
[57:24] completely lost again today amen but it
[57:26] means something to have a walk with god
[57:29] it means something to walk with god
[57:31] god's not gonna walk with something
[57:33] that's not right with him
[57:35] by the way
[57:37] did you notice something different when
[57:38] you came in the parking lot today

[58:11] then they didn't have a chance
[58:13] right they didn't have a choice
[58:15] and they didn't have a chance
[58:17] day one they moved in we've been praying
[58:20] and i've been laying my hands on that
[58:21] wall praying those people away
[58:24] i said god if there's no spiritual
[58:26] significance for them being here get rid
[58:29] of them right yes wednesday night during
[58:32] church they shut the doors changed the
[58:34] lock and they hadn't been back

[58:43] amen
[58:44] god knows exactly what he's doing and
[58:46] praise god for it amen amen
[58:49] thank god for that
[58:50] enoch walk with god now let's continue
[58:52] on enoch walked with god after he begot
[58:55] methuselah 300 years begot sons and
[58:58] daughters so it was that walk that
[59:01] caused him
[59:02] and and it wasn't just that but it was
[59:04] the placement of that
[59:06] it was that time for it to be that way
[59:09] there was it was not time for there to
[59:12] be a rapture in the first church age
[59:15] second third fourth fifth sixth it was
[59:17] supposed to be by the type of completion
[59:20] 7 that this last church age that was
[59:24] going to have a alive and remain group
[59:27] that was going to go in the rapture now
[59:30] all those that died in christ from that
[59:33] time
[59:34] from the time of the death of christ
[59:37] from that time till now that died in
[59:40] christ are going to raise
[59:42] we know that amen they're going to
[59:44] resurrect and we are all going to go
[59:47] together amen amen
[59:50] enoch was the first one the old
[59:52] testament scripture to to rapture
[59:55] now the second one will go to second
[59:57] kings
[59:59] you probably remember
[1:00:00] knowing your mind
[1:00:02] the second rapture
[1:00:04] second rapture would happen to be a man
[1:00:06] named elijah
[1:00:08] right
[1:00:09] his story is in second kings chapter two
[1:00:16] amen second kings chapter 2
[1:00:19] verse 9.
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:24] look at this now and it came to pass
[1:00:27] let's see i'm trying to hold i don't
[1:00:29] want to read too much of the story if
[1:00:30] you want to get more of the story
[1:00:32] background now with enoch there's not
[1:00:35] much story background
[1:00:36] there's not actually a lot recorded
[1:00:38] about enoch
[1:00:40] but
[1:00:42] if you want to go and read
[1:00:44] a lot of the background of the stories
[1:00:46] of that
[1:00:47] please you know
[1:00:48] feel free for sake of time i just picked
[1:00:51] a couple of the scriptures of the
[1:00:52] significant parts that recorded the
[1:00:55] actual catching away of this individual
[1:00:58] so there's a there's a lot of background
[1:01:00] story here we won't go to but uh but
[1:01:03] just reading the rapture part look now
[1:01:06] uh second kings 2 9 and it came to pass
[1:01:10] when they were gone over that elijah
[1:01:12] said unto elisha ask what i shall do for
[1:01:15] thee before i be taken away from thee
[1:01:17] and elisha said i pray thee let a double
[1:01:20] portion of my spirit be upon me
[1:01:23] now
[1:01:25] i i i want to say something here because
[1:01:27] i've had
[1:01:28] i've had
[1:01:30] i've heard
[1:01:32] a child just say nominal christians
[1:01:35] say well
[1:01:37] elisha cut himself short
[1:01:40] he should have asked for a tenfold
[1:01:42] portion
[1:01:43] he should ask for a hundred
[1:01:47] but i want you to understand
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:51] the prophet of god
[1:01:53] when
[1:01:54] when god spoke to him about sister
[1:01:58] hattie
[1:02:00] god said
[1:02:01] give her whatever she asked
[1:02:05] sister hattie could have asked for a
[1:02:07] billion dollars
[1:02:09] she could have asked to be the president
[1:02:11] united states
[1:02:12] she could have asked for almost anything
[1:02:15] she wanted to right
[1:02:18] but god knew what she was going to ask
[1:02:20] when he gave the prophet permission to
[1:02:22] get to give her whatever she wanted
[1:02:24] right he knew what she was going to say
[1:02:26] yeah she wanted the salvation of her
[1:02:28] voice she said well why didn't she ask
[1:02:30] for the salvation of her whole family
[1:02:31] why didn't she ask for the salvation the
[1:02:32] whole world why didn't she ask for this
[1:02:34] that you know because god knew what she
[1:02:37] was gonna ask right amen
[1:02:39] god knew what elisha was gonna say
[1:02:42] and it and it and it wasn't to the point
[1:02:44] yeah would god have done it sure it
[1:02:47] would have because that was that was his
[1:02:49] promise
[1:02:50] but that's not the point when you've got
[1:02:52] the spirit of god and you're led by god
[1:02:55] you sometimes speak and say things in a
[1:02:58] way or context that may not even be
[1:03:01] understandable to you
[1:03:03] but it's god doing it and it's the
[1:03:06] spirit of god speaking out
[1:03:09] and the spirit of god in this man only
[1:03:11] allowed him to say what he said
[1:03:14] not not a not tenfold not a hundredfold
[1:03:17] right but
[1:03:19] double
[1:03:20] right and that's what he wanted and
[1:03:21] that's what the spirit in him asked for
[1:03:24] amen and god blessed him with that
[1:03:26] god granted that when you read the
[1:03:28] scripture we see god granted that to him
[1:03:30] now 10th verse
[1:03:32] and he said thou has asked a hard thing
[1:03:35] nevertheless if thou see me when i am
[1:03:38] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[1:03:42] but if not it shall not be now notice
[1:03:44] this elijah already knows he's going to
[1:03:48] be
[1:03:50] you already know now to what capacity
[1:03:53] maybe he didn't know we don't know
[1:03:55] that's not recorded scripturally but he
[1:03:57] knew right now i i'll challenge you to
[1:04:00] listen to some of brother branham's last
[1:04:02] uh uh
[1:04:03] year or two especially the last ones and
[1:04:07] listen to the way that brother random
[1:04:09] talks
[1:04:10] if you really listen and get the
[1:04:13] undertone of what brother random is
[1:04:14] getting especially when he preaches
[1:04:17] wings of a snow white duck yes
[1:04:19] you just know now in retrospect it's
[1:04:22] pretty easy because hindsight is 20 20.
[1:04:24] and look back and say well i listen and
[1:04:26] i can i can see that now but he listened
[1:04:29] in the inflection in his voice
[1:04:31] something's going on
[1:04:33] something was about to change
[1:04:35] brother bannon was about to leave us
[1:04:37] now
[1:04:38] elijah
[1:04:40] is doing that with elisha
[1:04:43] he knows something's going on he knows
[1:04:45] the spirit is moving and bringing it to
[1:04:48] the point that he wasn't going to be
[1:04:50] with elisha much longer so he tells
[1:04:53] elisha elisha
[1:04:54] uh uh i'm going away
[1:04:57] now after i'm gone what would you like
[1:05:00] from the lord what would you like the
[1:05:01] lord to give you elijah says double
[1:05:04] portion he said that's a hard thing
[1:05:06] but if you see me when i leave then it
[1:05:09] will be granted to you
[1:05:11] when he goes
[1:05:13] amen now
[1:05:14] did brother random know he was going to
[1:05:16] have a car crash yes
[1:05:18] yeah well on wings of a snow white dove
[1:05:21] everything that he mentioned the dove
[1:05:23] had wrong with him is the same thing
[1:05:25] brother branham had in the rag
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:29] he doesn't say it on tape i didn't ask
[1:05:31] him personally so i don't know
[1:05:34] but
[1:05:34] the fact that he preached that
[1:05:37] would would lend you to believe that
[1:05:39] something was going on in the spirit at
[1:05:41] least anyway right elijah knew now what
[1:05:44] did he know was going to be a chair of
[1:05:46] fire whirlwind
[1:05:48] it doesn't say i
[1:05:50] very possibly did i don't know but he
[1:05:53] knew something was going on and he knew
[1:05:55] a change was coming
[1:05:57] so he asked us why he asked the question
[1:06:00] he said if you see me when i'm taken
[1:06:03] that it shall be so
[1:06:04] it came to pass 11th verse it came to
[1:06:08] pass as they still went on and taught
[1:06:10] that behold there appeared a chariot of
[1:06:12] fire
[1:06:14] and horses of fire
[1:06:16] and parted them both asunder and elijah
[1:06:20] went up
[1:06:21] by a whirlwind
[1:06:22] into heaven amen
[1:06:24] elisha
[1:06:26] rancher god taking him
[1:06:29] didn't taste death
[1:06:31] body change in a whirlwind took him into
[1:06:34] a chair now
[1:06:36] where's the scriptural precedent
[1:06:38] well the bible says that enoch enoch was
[1:06:42] and was not god took him for he was
[1:06:44] walked with god that's all it says
[1:06:46] now we've got an event of a chariot of
[1:06:48] fire and horses and a whirlwind that
[1:06:51] takes elijah up into heaven
[1:06:54] but the point of it is elisha is being
[1:06:56] raptured yes elijah was taken from this
[1:06:59] earth another type now was elisha
[1:07:03] raptured
[1:07:05] no he got a double portion of the spirit
[1:07:08] of god but god did rapture him right
[1:07:12] different type different purpose
[1:07:15] you understand see i i don't like so
[1:07:18] many times
[1:07:20] that christians even in the message they
[1:07:23] try to box everybody that they believe
[1:07:26] is a christian or born again or in the
[1:07:28] message hey try to box everybody into
[1:07:30] these little boxes and say you've got to
[1:07:33] be this you got to do that and you got
[1:07:35] to say this
[1:07:36] and god did not make cocky cookie cutter
[1:07:39] christians
[1:07:41] god did not have an assembly up in
[1:07:43] heaven with a with a cookie cutter in
[1:07:46] hand saying there's this one there's
[1:07:48] that one there's the next one and sent
[1:07:50] them down on earth here they go down on
[1:07:53] earth everybody's going to be the same
[1:07:55] do the same live the same doesn't work
[1:07:57] that way god has a separate purpose for
[1:07:59] every single person that he uh brings
[1:08:02] upon this earth yes
[1:08:04] now the process of being born again
[1:08:06] obviously is the same for everyone but
[1:08:08] god has a different purpose for everyone
[1:08:11] and elijah's purpose for god typing
[1:08:15] was to go in the rapture yeah it wasn't
[1:08:18] for elisha but it was for elijah amen as
[1:08:22] we can find out later in the scripture
[1:08:25] right amen and you would think now
[1:08:28] did moses go over the promised land
[1:08:31] god wouldn't allow him to
[1:08:34] but we don't even know what happened
[1:08:36] right the the devils the satan and the
[1:08:39] angels of god fighting over his body
[1:08:43] we we don't know
[1:08:45] you think well there was a man that was
[1:08:47] i mean wrote most the new testament of
[1:08:49] the old testament that he would have
[1:08:51] gone into rapture
[1:08:53] but you can't make
[1:08:55] you can't make natural human common
[1:08:57] sense out of the things that god does
[1:09:00] right amen yeah there's very little
[1:09:03] recorded about enoch and god just said
[1:09:06] he was not because god took him
[1:09:08] there's a lot more about elijah's life
[1:09:11] but then the chariot that took him up
[1:09:13] but then he didn't take elisha why not
[1:09:17] because there's there's a tight there
[1:09:19] there's a fulfillment of scripture that
[1:09:21] was to come along through the ages that
[1:09:24] was to help us understand wine
[1:09:27] yes but
[1:09:29] two raptures now yes
[1:09:31] two catching aways that have happened in
[1:09:33] the scriptures so far
[1:09:35] now we get to
[1:09:36] uh
[1:09:39] i won't say a little fuzzy area but uh
[1:09:42] we get to an area that uh people would
[1:09:45] question more
[1:09:46] the third rapture
[1:09:49] the third rapture in the scripture now
[1:09:53] the third and fourth rapture
[1:09:55] are are
[1:09:57] basically synonymous
[1:09:59] let's just go over and read
[1:10:02] excuse me uh over in acts chapter one
[1:10:11] you know i
[1:10:12] i just feel led let's go to matthew i
[1:10:15] was going to put acts first let's go to
[1:10:17] matthew chapter 28.
[1:10:21] something's telling me here we need
[1:10:23] let's let's go to matthew chapter 28
[1:10:26] or 27 excuse me
[1:10:28] saint matthew chapter 27
[1:10:36] because the third and fourth raptures
[1:10:40] which there are four like i said started
[1:10:42] there are four raptures that have
[1:10:43] happened scripturally already
[1:10:45] we know that
[1:10:46] no we're going to saw the first two
[1:10:48] already hold them out scripture
[1:10:51] but the next two
[1:10:53] are are
[1:10:55] synonymous
[1:10:56] uh they run and congruent
[1:10:59] to
[1:11:00] each other
[1:11:01] happen at the same time
[1:11:04] uh
[1:11:05] matthew chapter 27 let's read uh
[1:11:08] beginning with verse
[1:11:10] uh let's see where we'll start 45
[1:11:13] let's start with verse 45 matthew 27 45
[1:11:20] now from the sixth hour there was
[1:11:22] darkness all over the land until the
[1:11:24] ninth hour and about the ninth hour
[1:11:25] jesus christ the loud voice eli ilama
[1:11:28] sabachthani that is to say my god my god
[1:11:31] why is thou forsaken me
[1:11:33] some of them that stood there when they
[1:11:35] heard that
[1:11:36] said this man called for elias straight
[1:11:38] way one of them ran took a sponge filled
[1:11:40] it with vinegar put it on a reed and
[1:11:42] gave him the drink
[1:11:43] the rest said let it let be let us see
[1:11:46] whether elias will come and save him
[1:11:48] jesus when he had cried again with a
[1:11:50] loud voice with a loud voice
[1:11:53] voice now we've read
[1:11:55] uh thessalonians chapter 4 how many
[1:11:57] times
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:00] what's the voice the voice
[1:12:03] the voice is the second part it is the
[1:12:06] voice that rings out in the in
[1:12:08] resurrecting the dead which
[1:12:10] i want to lord willing to take those
[1:12:12] three things and break them down more as
[1:12:15] well uh but understand that that that
[1:12:19] voice
[1:12:20] is synonymous with the voice in first
[1:12:22] thessalonians 4
[1:12:24] the voice of god that rings out that
[1:12:27] cries out jesus cried out with a loud
[1:12:30] voice yielding up the ghost
[1:12:33] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:12:35] rent and twain from top to bottom the
[1:12:37] earth did quake the rocks did rent you
[1:12:40] know brother brahms told brother uh
[1:12:41] green that's how those big rocks got up
[1:12:43] sabino yeah
[1:12:45] he said those big rocks big sizeable
[1:12:47] mobile homes that he got there at the
[1:12:48] time of the scripture when the uh
[1:12:50] earthquake and the rocks rent
[1:12:52] amen now you go up in their little tram
[1:12:55] and they'll tell you a whole different
[1:12:56] story this that and the other but i
[1:12:58] think i'm going to take what brother
[1:12:59] branham said amen amen anybody with me
[1:13:02] yeah rather
[1:13:03] i'll take what program said amen those
[1:13:05] were put in place when the earthquake
[1:13:08] rocks rent that's the scripture
[1:13:10] and the graves were open
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:13] many of the bodies of the saints which
[1:13:15] slept
[1:13:16] arose amen the dead that had gone past
[1:13:21] on
[1:13:22] now
[1:13:24] i try to keep myself from saying in
[1:13:26] christ because they weren't in christ
[1:13:29] this is pre-jesus
[1:13:30] but those who died
[1:13:32] uh with their testimony of god yes they
[1:13:35] like like like an enoch or noah walked
[1:13:39] with god
[1:13:40] amen had that testimony that they
[1:13:43] pleased god
[1:13:46] those graves were opened all that had
[1:13:48] gone on that were in god all the
[1:13:51] predestined before now predestination
[1:13:53] didn't start just with the new testament
[1:13:55] you know that it didn't just start with
[1:13:57] this time right it just just didn't
[1:13:59] start with this day that we're living
[1:14:01] predestination has been the mind of god
[1:14:03] since god said let there be
[1:14:07] that that's the predestination started
[1:14:09] there that's all it means people don't
[1:14:11] want to believe it but predestination is
[1:14:13] just the mind of god
[1:14:14] it's just the predetermined of god that
[1:14:16] he already knew is him being god the
[1:14:18] beginning from the inning what there
[1:14:20] would be and not be
[1:14:22] pre-german predetermined predestined
[1:14:25] amen that doesn't throw us out because
[1:14:27] we're still free moral agents right amen
[1:14:30] but the predestination of there all
[1:14:33] those die from out of months
[1:14:37] amen then you go look at brother pat's
[1:14:40] chart he wrote up there from the first
[1:14:42] person to ever die and we'll say well
[1:14:44] well that that would be able then right
[1:14:48] amen that would be able not adam
[1:14:50] the first person able whose blood cried
[1:14:53] out to god from that time till the time
[1:14:55] of jesus
[1:14:56] being here let's say till the time of of
[1:14:59] this time
[1:15:00] when jesus himself died
[1:15:03] amen i hate saying the word died he
[1:15:05] didn't die do you know what i'm saying
[1:15:07] right but this time every one of them
[1:15:10] their graves opened up and they rose up
[1:15:12] out of the grave amen amen
[1:15:15] what did they do after they rose up out
[1:15:17] of the grave now this is the type that
[1:15:19] we have remember when the voice of jesus
[1:15:21] cried out and the voice of christ cries
[1:15:24] out in 1st thessalonians 4 and that
[1:15:27] voice cries out to do what to raise the
[1:15:29] dead
[1:15:30] when his voice cried out here to raise
[1:15:32] the dead it was simply a type
[1:15:36] of god showing us what he's going to do
[1:15:39] in this last day for us in this last
[1:15:42] time rapture amen
[1:15:44] which is actually only rapture five
[1:15:47] right we got six of them
[1:15:49] but our rapture here
[1:15:51] it doesn't end the raptures
[1:15:53] there's a rapture after hours yeah but
[1:15:56] what do they do
[1:15:57] those graves opened up and all those
[1:16:00] testament old testament saints rose
[1:16:04] they come up from the dead
[1:16:06] and then what did they do
[1:16:08] and they came out of the graves after
[1:16:11] his resurrection
[1:16:13] and went into the holy city and did what
[1:16:16] appeared unto many yes
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:21] people want to
[1:16:22] become popular today i see dead people
[1:16:28] but this
[1:16:29] rapture this excuse me resurrection for
[1:16:33] this last day
[1:16:35] is going to be for them to appear before
[1:16:39] many
[1:16:40] not just one person
[1:16:42] the people that raised in this last day
[1:16:45] aren't just going to go to one person
[1:16:46] right they're not just going to be there
[1:16:48] for one person to see
[1:16:50] they're going to appear unto many
[1:16:53] and that's exactly what the old
[1:16:54] testament saints did they walked around
[1:16:57] it and they appeared unto many
[1:17:00] now there's debate as to whether
[1:17:04] those people standing there at their
[1:17:05] time knew whether that was uh adam or
[1:17:08] not
[1:17:09] knew whether that was enoch or not knew
[1:17:12] whether that was
[1:17:13] abraham or not
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:17] you can debate it all you want that's
[1:17:18] your choice right doesn't tell us
[1:17:21] brother brown never says that i know of
[1:17:23] amen but we can type into the
[1:17:25] understanding that when brother branham
[1:17:27] went beyond the curtain of time
[1:17:29] and his little baby girl was a was a
[1:17:31] grown 19 20 year old girl he did not
[1:17:34] know her amen
[1:17:36] he she had to introduce herself to him
[1:17:39] and said i was your little sharon rose
[1:17:41] on earth
[1:17:43] amen right
[1:17:44] so
[1:17:45] we can understand by that precedent i
[1:17:48] know it's not scripture right but i i
[1:17:51] believe it happened and i believe that's
[1:17:53] exactly what's going to happen
[1:17:55] as brother branham tells it
[1:17:57] that he did not know her yeah
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:01] but there was an introduction that took
[1:18:03] place right i often think what is it
[1:18:06] going to be when our son comes and
[1:18:08] appears before me and my wife
[1:18:10] he was just a little baby he got his
[1:18:12] picture on my phone just he's just a
[1:18:14] little innocent baby that he was a day
[1:18:17] and a half old
[1:18:19] what's he going to look like because
[1:18:21] he's not going to look
[1:18:22] hardly anything probably like he looked
[1:18:24] when he was a little baby clap clipped
[1:18:26] lip and palate and all that he's not
[1:18:28] gonna look like that
[1:18:30] he's gonna be strong and healthy and 19
[1:18:34] 20 year old
[1:18:35] perfect specimen of a male
[1:18:37] and he's going to come and look at us i
[1:18:40] i don't know i i i know i know sharon
[1:18:43] rose had to introduce yourself brother
[1:18:45] brandon but i just some reason get the
[1:18:47] feeling i'm gonna know him
[1:18:49] i just when when that young man walks up
[1:18:52] or comes into our uh
[1:18:54] uh
[1:18:55] church or living room or whatever i i i
[1:18:58] just think i'm gonna know him and if i
[1:19:00] don't it's okay because he'll tell me
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:04] but you know
[1:19:07] the spirit of god is just going to be
[1:19:09] moving so at that time
[1:19:11] and and and the dead in christ will have
[1:19:14] just raised and
[1:19:16] and
[1:19:17] god
[1:19:18] moving on his gentile bride shaking her
[1:19:21] getting her ready like that little dew
[1:19:23] drop getting ready to go back to heaven
[1:19:24] again
[1:19:25] and that spirit moving in that anointing
[1:19:28] so strong i just feel like i'm gonna
[1:19:30] know him
[1:19:31] amen but it's okay again it's okay if i
[1:19:33] don't because i will know him anyway
[1:19:36] even if he has to say i was so and so
[1:19:38] and such and such
[1:19:40] amen but when the graves of the old
[1:19:42] testament saints opened they walked
[1:19:45] around people thousands of years never
[1:19:48] saw them didn't know them they read in
[1:19:51] the bible or in the torah about about
[1:19:53] their lives and who they were
[1:19:55] and can you imagine
[1:19:58] what it
[1:19:59] what it was like
[1:20:01] because that's the type and the
[1:20:03] precedent set for this last day rapture
[1:20:06] for the gentiles
[1:20:08] that as those that slept in christ
[1:20:11] through the through the from the first
[1:20:13] chase till today after the death of
[1:20:15] jesus from that time till now are going
[1:20:18] to raise up
[1:20:21] and i mean you know saint martin if he
[1:20:23] came through the door
[1:20:25] irenaeus or martin luther or any of
[1:20:28] those saints back in the
[1:20:30] 800s uh the thousand year through the
[1:20:34] dark ages
[1:20:35] no they're going to come up and they're
[1:20:37] going to resurrect
[1:20:39] i don't i don't i don't know how i would
[1:20:41] know those people right no but
[1:20:45] somehow
[1:20:47] god works it out to where
[1:20:50] they're going to visit us for a minimum
[1:20:53] brother brown said brother green a
[1:20:55] minimum 30 days if people want to fight
[1:20:58] over the 30 40 45 whatever it is
[1:21:02] don't argue about trivial stuff
[1:21:04] and i i know what the bible says i
[1:21:06] understand the scriptural precedent i
[1:21:09] know brother brown said at least brother
[1:21:11] greece's testimony to him is a minimum
[1:21:13] 30 days yeah so i i'm just going to
[1:21:16] leave it at that if you want it to be 40
[1:21:19] that's fine i have no confidence i have
[1:21:21] no uh uh
[1:21:24] problem with that
[1:21:25] you wanted to be 45 i don't have any
[1:21:27] problem with that just as long as we're
[1:21:29] here and a part of it isn't that what
[1:21:31] matters
[1:21:32] that's what matters the most amen is
[1:21:34] that we're here and that we're a part of
[1:21:36] it
[1:21:37] and they're going to appear before us
[1:21:41] get to see angel jr
[1:21:43] i told you he's gonna be like that
[1:21:44] picture
[1:21:45] you married him
[1:21:47] he's gonna be like when you marry him
[1:21:49] you're gonna be like when you're married
[1:21:51] graceful
[1:21:53] amen who wouldn't look forward to that
[1:21:56] right i talked last week about the
[1:21:58] handwriting in the wall and how how it's
[1:22:00] such a struggle to see what's happening
[1:22:02] in the world in our country today but
[1:22:03] friend who would not want that exactly
[1:22:06] right
[1:22:07] amen right praise the lord amen i'm so
[1:22:10] thankful and see i don't know my dad and
[1:22:14] angel jr they didn't know each other on
[1:22:15] this earth but you know they might have
[1:22:17] found an acquaintance once they've
[1:22:18] gotten up there
[1:22:20] they might know each other now
[1:22:22] and that'd be all right praise the lord
[1:22:25] they're all coming together yes because
[1:22:27] it's all coming together
[1:22:29] thank god it's coming to that place
[1:22:31] it's becoming more and more real all the
[1:22:33] time yes it is amen the graves of me
[1:22:36] were opened many of the bodies of saints
[1:22:38] which slept arose and they came out of
[1:22:40] the graves after his resurrection after
[1:22:42] his resurrection now notice that right
[1:22:45] it it
[1:22:46] it says when he when he gave the loud
[1:22:49] voice is when it happened but the what
[1:22:51] it says here was after his resurrection
[1:22:54] after resurrection of christ is when
[1:22:57] they rose
[1:22:58] you understand that was synonymous
[1:23:00] because christ had to go to hell and
[1:23:02] take the keys and empty out paradise to
[1:23:05] bring him with him right that's the way
[1:23:07] he had to do that
[1:23:08] to to to bring them forth and so they
[1:23:11] came forth there after he emptied out
[1:23:13] paradise all the graves opened at his
[1:23:16] resurrection and they all came and
[1:23:18] appeared unto many now you read about
[1:23:20] jesus going around and
[1:23:22] spending time with his disciples and
[1:23:25] having fish on the brother john's
[1:23:27] amen uh having fish on the fire you know
[1:23:30] we had that sushi discussion yesterday
[1:23:32] is asking me what i didn't like for food
[1:23:35] and i said i don't like sushi and john's
[1:23:38] like well i like that bible says jesus
[1:23:40] put fish on the fire
[1:23:45] nothing knocking anybody that likes
[1:23:47] sushi it seems to his own that's all
[1:23:49] right it's just not my thing but anyway
[1:23:51] feet
[1:23:52] fish put fish on the fire
[1:23:54] and commune with them fellowship with
[1:23:57] them and had to convince thomas it was
[1:23:59] him here thomas put your hand in me you
[1:24:02] know uh
[1:24:03] because he had not been glorified but
[1:24:05] see that
[1:24:06] that
[1:24:08] recordation structurally
[1:24:10] helps us to probably get a a fair idea
[1:24:14] of what the others were doing
[1:24:17] maybe exactly what the others that that
[1:24:20] had raised with christ what were they
[1:24:22] doing
[1:24:24] they were doing probably the same thing
[1:24:28] i don't think that an abel rose
[1:24:32] and people not knowing him maybe that
[1:24:35] he'd have introduced her or say you know
[1:24:37] i don't what am i supposed to do now i
[1:24:39] don't know any of these people
[1:24:41] i don't think it was like that at all
[1:24:45] i believe it was it was to the point
[1:24:47] that he was able to introduce himself
[1:24:50] and to talk to those people and to
[1:24:52] fellowship with those people and
[1:24:54] and encourage those people and and
[1:24:57] just such a spirit of god moving there
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:00] see because we can't imagine it like
[1:25:02] it's imagined here we can't think of it
[1:25:05] like like what we feel and see and know
[1:25:08] for for this present time and on the
[1:25:11] anointing anointing friends it's all
[1:25:12] going to be so
[1:25:14] different right
[1:25:17] take the best anointing you've ever felt
[1:25:19] and the spirit of god in the service or
[1:25:21] something and just multiply it times a
[1:25:23] billion maybe i don't know it it's just
[1:25:26] going to be a
[1:25:28] i believe it was a time and will be a
[1:25:31] time of of such an anointing flowing
[1:25:34] around it that that it would just be a
[1:25:36] jubilee
[1:25:40] the only difference
[1:25:43] is that
[1:25:44] when jesus went
[1:25:46] they went with him
[1:25:49] that's the difference
[1:25:51] when
[1:25:52] and but today
[1:25:54] when
[1:25:55] they go
[1:25:56] be alive and remain go with them yes
[1:26:00] amen right the alive and remain did not
[1:26:02] go with them at this time right
[1:26:06] but if this day today the alive and
[1:26:10] remain will go with the dead in christ
[1:26:13] after they raised and appear unto many
[1:26:15] we will all rapture we will all go see
[1:26:20] jesus yes amen gentile anyway
[1:26:23] the jews still get dealt with by god
[1:26:25] after
[1:26:26] it goes down after the of course the
[1:26:28] the wedding sup for the lamb goes down
[1:26:31] and reveals himself to his people then
[1:26:34] amen and you get 144 000 sealed but
[1:26:37] those graves were opened many of the
[1:26:38] bodies and they appeared unto many
[1:26:41] amen amen that's
[1:26:46] a resurrection
[1:26:48] it's not a rapture
[1:26:51] um
[1:26:52] my time's caught up with me
[1:26:56] but i want to read two things real quick
[1:27:00] and then i'm going to close and i will
[1:27:03] probably have to
[1:27:04] come back to the rest of this
[1:27:07] first uh chapter 1
[1:27:10] verse 8
[1:27:14] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:27:17] the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:27:19] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:27:21] in jerusalem and all judea and the
[1:27:23] samaria and the uttermost parts of the
[1:27:25] earth
[1:27:26] and when he had spoken
[1:27:29] while they beheld he was taken up
[1:27:33] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:27:36] sight
[1:27:37] a cloud received jesus out of their
[1:27:40] sight
[1:27:42] jesus was raptured right
[1:27:45] he was taken up caught away from them
[1:27:49] now ephesians chapter 4
[1:27:53] verse 8
[1:27:55] says wherefore let's start with verse 7.
[1:27:59] ephesians 4 7 but unto everyone that has
[1:28:02] given grace according to the ministry of
[1:28:03] the gifts of christ wherefore he says
[1:28:06] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:28:08] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:28:11] men
[1:28:12] he did what he led the captivity captive
[1:28:15] and he released them he emptied out
[1:28:18] paradise and he took them with him
[1:28:22] when he ascended
[1:28:25] now he that ascended what is it that but
[1:28:28] he descended first into the lower parts
[1:28:30] of the earth which we just said he that
[1:28:32] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:28:35] up far above all heavens that he might
[1:28:38] feel all things but when he led the
[1:28:40] captivity that was captive
[1:28:43] and the graves opened and they came
[1:28:46] forth
[1:28:47] after his resurrection
[1:28:49] they walked around and talked and
[1:28:51] fellowshipped and went in
[1:28:54] the rapture with jesus
[1:28:56] jesus took him
[1:28:58] took them with him
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:02] jesus took them with him now jesus my
[1:29:05] last thought here real quick jesus was
[1:29:08] that cornerstone
[1:29:10] rapture
[1:29:12] jesus being the cornerstone rapture was
[1:29:17] was the first one
[1:29:19] to die
[1:29:22] resurrect
[1:29:23] and then rapture
[1:29:26] jesus was enoch didn't die
[1:29:29] elijah didn't die right now
[1:29:32] these raptures are synonymous because
[1:29:35] jesus and
[1:29:37] he took the old testament saints with
[1:29:39] him
[1:29:40] but brother brown puts
[1:29:42] jesus rapture as the third one
[1:29:45] yes
[1:29:46] brother branham did yes you looked at it
[1:29:48] and said well they they came together
[1:29:50] went together but brother branham put
[1:29:53] jesus as the third and final old
[1:29:56] testament rapture yes right so that's
[1:29:59] what i'm gonna do
[1:30:01] put the
[1:30:02] jesus rapture as the third one
[1:30:06] and of course in the old testament
[1:30:08] saints which the first rapture he calls
[1:30:11] of the new testament was the old
[1:30:12] testament saints that rose with him that
[1:30:15] raptured with him but jesus being that
[1:30:19] cornerstone one was the one that changed
[1:30:22] it to understand this last day type
[1:30:26] of not just the alive and remained at
[1:30:29] rapture
[1:30:30] but a death
[1:30:32] resurrection and then a rapture
[1:30:35] yeah jesus represented both groups in
[1:30:38] his one
[1:30:39] rapture yes he represented the dead that
[1:30:42] were raised and the alive and remain
[1:30:45] that rapture yes
[1:30:47] amen the cornerstone of the rapture yes
[1:30:51] that jesus did yes when he changed
[1:30:54] everything
[1:30:55] let me read this i'll close after this
[1:30:59] in the rapture message abraham said the
[1:31:01] old testament saints has gone into his
[1:31:04] presence paradise done away
[1:31:08] and the old testament saints ascended up
[1:31:10] at his loud voice
[1:31:12] when he screamed and give up the ghost
[1:31:15] because why this sacrifice the
[1:31:17] perpetuation of their sins they had
[1:31:20] waited on believing that the perfect
[1:31:22] lamb was coming
[1:31:23] they had offered the sacrifice the lamb
[1:31:25] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:31:27] ghost he screamed with a loud voice
[1:31:30] old testament saints a wolf watched the
[1:31:33] shout over here he says the same thing
[1:31:35] yielded up the ghost
[1:31:37] and when he did that sacrifice was
[1:31:40] perfect
[1:31:41] and paradise emptied out
[1:31:44] the old testament saints came to the
[1:31:46] earth again walked around on earth
[1:31:50] and entered in with him at his rapture
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:55] that's the four that we know of that
[1:31:58] have taken place
[1:31:59] to this day the four raptures of the six
[1:32:02] in the scripture three old testament
[1:32:04] three new testaments that everything
[1:32:06] will be established the mouth of two or
[1:32:08] three witnesses three is perfection
[1:32:11] amen three in the old testament three in
[1:32:13] the new testament one new testament
[1:32:16] already gone
[1:32:17] amen
[1:32:18] what's left what's next
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:22] that's what we've been trying to get to
[1:32:24] yeah right amen
[1:32:26] the time of the call
[1:32:30] or let's stand if we could
[1:32:40] amen
[1:32:41] i'm so
[1:32:42] thankful
[1:32:43] that god has
[1:32:45] made that provision
[1:32:47] made that way
[1:32:49] caused it to be in tight
[1:32:51] now if we were in a different age it
[1:32:54] would be okay
[1:32:55] right
[1:32:56] because we're going anyway that's true

[1:33:57] grapes will open again
