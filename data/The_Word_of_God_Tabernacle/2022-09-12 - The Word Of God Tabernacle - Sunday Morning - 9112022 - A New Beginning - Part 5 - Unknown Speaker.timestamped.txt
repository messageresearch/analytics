[29:24] wanna play along um
[29:26] just wanna uh thank everyone uh for
[29:29] those of you who prayed for me during
[29:30] the whenever i got my nose surgery a few
[29:32] weeks ago it's been
[29:34] i don't think it's been quite a month
[29:35] but uh just about there but um
[29:38] publicly thank the lord for healing me
[29:40] and uh making that quick recovery of it
[29:42] um i honestly didn't realize how bad um
[29:46] everything was but my nose um the left
[29:48] side of my nose was pretty
[29:51] uh quick you didn't yeah at least like
[29:53] the middle part uh the septum or
[29:56] whatever they call it but i couldn't
[29:58] breathe out of that side of my nose for
[30:00] years now and i didn't really claim it i
[30:02] was kind of afraid to go to the doctor
[30:04] to be honest uh to figure out what it
[30:05] was
[30:09] but
[30:10] um yeah the worst of it really was just
[30:13] the pain after the fact and then um
[30:16] you know i can breathe now
[30:18] you know a lot better than i could
[30:20] before i could smell better and it
[30:22] tastes better and
[30:25] i feel like i'm sleeping better too i
[30:26] guess it can cause sleep apnea if you
[30:28] can't
[30:29] breathe directly through your nose so i

[41:04] amen thank you jesus
[41:06] he's wonderful
[41:08] amen what a name that precious name

[41:20] so good to us isn't he
[41:22] amen lord bless you let's stand to our
[41:24] feet if we could amen we'll go go ahead
[41:26] and change for the service now
[41:29] amen
[41:31] we're going to go back over to genesis
[41:33] chapter one again
[41:35] read those couple of verses of scripture
[41:37] continue on with the thought that we've
[41:38] had here the past few weeks a month or
[41:40] so
[41:41] amen the new beginning part five yes and
[41:44] so we will go to genesis chapter one
[41:47] read a couple of verses of scripture
[41:51] and in the first couple of verses
[41:57] amen genesis chapter one
[42:01] i don't know how long uh
[42:03] this may be a little shorter service
[42:05] today we'll see how the lord does it
[42:08] um
[42:10] but
[42:12] kind of the tail end of this is kind of
[42:14] getting into a whole other service and i
[42:16] felt like if i
[42:17] tried to bring it in with this today it
[42:19] would be very lengthy so i was thinking
[42:21] of breaking them both up but doing that
[42:23] may make today a little shorter so but
[42:25] however the lord leads
[42:27] however he wants we'll just see um we'll
[42:30] just start and let him have control
[42:34] praise the lord so whatever his desire
[42:36] is that's what we want
[42:38] amen
[42:39] genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[42:42] and then before we read this by our
[42:43] heads for word of prayer lord jesus is

[44:57] for this service today as we committed
[44:59] to you in the name of the lord jesus
[45:00] christ we pray amen
[45:02] amen amen genesis 1
[45:06] verse 1 in the beginning god created the
[45:08] heaven and the earth the earth was
[45:10] without form and void and darkness is
[45:12] upon the face of the deep the spirit of
[45:14] god moved upon the face of the waters
[45:17] you could be seated as you if you'd like
[45:24] last week
[45:28] i didn't get any comments but myself
[45:32] pursling
[45:33] i felt like i was rushing myself for
[45:36] going quickly through the last part of
[45:38] this
[45:39] so
[45:40] bear with me for a few moments if i take
[45:42] five or ten minutes to kind of uh
[45:44] background what we finished with last
[45:47] week and kind of reiterate some of those
[45:50] and it will also uh kind of springboard
[45:52] us into what we want to enter into today
[45:55] because we finished on the fifth feast
[45:57] or the fourth feast and we want to talk
[45:59] more about the fifth the sixth then uh
[46:02] the sixth is where i wanna really mostly
[46:04] concentrate on next week uh but the the
[46:07] sixth and then of course then the
[46:08] seventh which we kind of did a couple of
[46:10] weeks ago but just wanted to background
[46:13] for a little bit and of course read
[46:14] another quote to here that i meant to
[46:16] last week
[46:18] uh to kind of get us caught up in this
[46:20] place because we had the first two
[46:22] feasts uh which were the redemption and
[46:25] the fellowship and we got into the third
[46:27] which were specific times which one
[46:30] immediately followed the other
[46:31] redemption immediately a fellowship with
[46:34] the lord immediately followed our
[46:35] redemption uh which brought us to a
[46:37] place of the first fruits of the waving
[46:39] of the of the sheaf waving uh which was
[46:42] uh
[46:43] a symbolic of the bride today uh a
[46:46] loosely fit together group that was
[46:49] bound together by one common thread we
[46:52] know today that's jesus and it was
[46:54] mingled with oil as it went into this uh
[46:57] as it went into this meal offering that
[46:59] was given to the lord and as this meal
[47:01] often was given to the lord it was a it
[47:03] was a meal offering a fine flour which
[47:06] of course again represents christ
[47:08] mingled with oil which we know is the
[47:10] holy spirit and that mingling was just a
[47:12] rubbing of oil on
[47:15] or with that
[47:17] with that flower and and we gone from
[47:20] that waving of the first fruits which
[47:22] you know christ was the first fruits to
[47:23] come to maturity uh that was way before
[47:26] the people
[47:28] knowing that that first fruit was just
[47:30] that it was only the first of many that
[47:34] were to come
[47:35] it was just the beginning of it it
[47:37] wasn't the whole thing it was just that
[47:39] one wave sheet
[47:41] one bundling but it was symbolic of what
[47:44] was to come it was a beginning it was a
[47:47] showing forth that as this wheat has
[47:50] reached its place of maturity and it's
[47:53] been offered back to god it's been way
[47:56] before the lord in acceptance that god
[47:59] would receive it to himself it was to
[48:01] show that there were there was more of
[48:04] this to come
[48:06] it's again i said it's sort of like the
[48:08] the application sort of not exactly but
[48:10] sora like the application of tithing
[48:13] where you know you give unto the lord
[48:14] you give god thanks for what god has
[48:17] done and you give it to the lord and the
[48:19] priest receives that
[48:21] and waves it on behalf of the people
[48:24] before the lord
[48:26] knowing
[48:27] thank god that there's going to be more
[48:30] to come
[48:31] amen right do you see the blessings that
[48:33] god gives there is the same thing
[48:35] scripturally it's the blessings that god
[48:37] gives when it's way before the lord is
[48:40] simply showing there's more coming so as
[48:42] this first jesus christ
[48:45] reached that place or was at that place
[48:48] of maturity we know
[48:49] that you say well he was god well of
[48:51] course he was god but the hebrews tells
[48:53] us that he learned
[48:55] obedience through the things which he
[48:58] suffered so if he is a human in flesh
[49:01] learned then how about us
[49:03] he was perfect done no wrong made no
[49:05] mistake sin uh had no sin
[49:08] and yet he learned well what about us
[49:11] see but what it's showing is this first
[49:13] wave sheath is showing is that jesus
[49:17] christ our high priest
[49:20] that came to that place of maturity and
[49:22] was waived as an offering
[49:25] as an offering for us that there were
[49:27] more to come behind it more not just
[49:30] more people but more that reach that
[49:33] place of maturity just like he did amen
[49:37] get to the exact same place that he was
[49:40] when he was offered that was the whole
[49:42] point so behind him was going to be us
[49:45] there was going to be a bride that
[49:48] through the indwelling presence of the
[49:50] holy spirit which is the next feast
[49:53] the indwelling of the holy spirit which
[49:55] is the next wave loaf was the next feast
[49:59] was going to be the indwelling presence
[50:01] of god that was going to change us
[50:05] uh into being like him
[50:07] that we were going to be able to come to
[50:09] maturity just as he came to maturity we
[50:13] were going to be like him because in the
[50:16] next verse the oil wasn't just with the
[50:19] flower the oil by the power of the fire
[50:24] was baked into the flower and the flower
[50:27] and the oil became one yes
[50:30] and when they became one it was symbolic
[50:33] of the holy spirit coming in us christ
[50:35] in us becoming one yes us becoming one
[50:39] with him bringing us to that place of
[50:42] offering that this bride is to come or
[50:45] be at that place of maturity just like
[50:48] he was
[50:49] we are to so much reflect
[50:52] jesus christ
[50:54] that there should be a time that we that
[50:57] people mistake us for him yes people
[51:01] make a big thing out of
[51:03] people praying to brother branham and
[51:05] baptizing him in his name and calling
[51:06] him god and all these things and
[51:08] worshiping brother branham but you know
[51:10] what friend it's just a carnal interp
[51:12] interpretation of the spiritual
[51:14] revelations all it is
[51:16] because the fact of it is every one of
[51:18] us should be able to get to that place
[51:19] every one of us should are going to get
[51:21] to that place
[51:22] of maturity now his gift before the lord
[51:26] was a little different than our gift
[51:28] but as far as the spiritual application
[51:30] of our lives to him we will get to that
[51:33] place too
[51:34] that was just a symbolic nature of it
[51:37] the word people said that well that was
[51:38] carnal obviously and that's not right to
[51:41] worship brother brown we know that
[51:42] brother branham wasn't god brother
[51:44] branham was not my savior he was sinner
[51:46] saved by the grace of god just like i am
[51:48] but in our day the first one to come to
[51:51] that place of maturity there were people
[51:53] confused
[51:54] even today 60 years later almost people
[51:58] still look back and have confusion
[52:01] between god and brother branham
[52:03] jesus christ and brother brown friend
[52:05] you know i don't want people to worship
[52:07] me i don't want anybody to baptize in my
[52:09] name but i would so like for people to
[52:12] mistake me for jesus
[52:15] amen
[52:17] but see my point is
[52:19] that's the point of this feast that we
[52:22] type it of course into the spiritual to
[52:24] the bride for this now it's just a feast
[52:26] for them that they were giving back to
[52:28] the lord god received it of them but it
[52:30] became a greater remember
[52:33] the law wasn't done away with it was
[52:35] magnified the law wasn't uh amplified to
[52:39] the place that we that it is a law to us
[52:42] but what he's done is it has become a
[52:45] part of who we are
[52:48] uh we live the word because we because
[52:50] that's what we are that's what we do
[52:52] because it's who we are and it just
[52:55] shows that the two become one so much so
[52:58] that that you can't tell them apart you
[53:01] can't separate them
[53:03] uh like i said last week you may have if
[53:06] you are inclined to or able to have
[53:09] taken the mingling of the oil with the
[53:11] fine flour and separated them again at
[53:13] some point but once the holy ghost and
[53:16] fire comes and bakes that holy spirit
[53:19] into you and the two of you become one
[53:22] there is no separating at that point
[53:24] right you are one
[53:26] that's why the bible says
[53:28] that you are sealed until your
[53:31] destination and this is not our
[53:33] destination friend right yes amen
[53:35] florida is not our destination arizona
[53:38] is not our destination new york city
[53:40] chicago la those are not another country
[53:42] russia
[53:43] japan those are not our deaths our
[53:45] destination is in heaven yes and you are
[53:48] sealed until your destination yeah
[53:51] praise the lord so god as he has shown
[53:54] to us that perfection of the cro of
[53:57] christ and the bride becoming one it was
[54:00] just symbolic to them in leviticus 23.
[54:03] it was just something that god was
[54:05] giving them that was making it a feast
[54:08] time of acceptance by the lord
[54:11] remember all the lord give even from the
[54:14] time that god killed the sheepskin and
[54:16] thrown to adam and eve was nothing but
[54:18] provisional ways that god was making so
[54:22] he would accept the people
[54:24] if they did what he said to do in
[54:26] obedience to his word that's what it was
[54:29] it's the same as obedience today
[54:32] but in a different way now we obey it
[54:34] because it's his word to us through his
[54:37] spirit that makes us like him we become
[54:40] more like him
[54:41] than we become like him yes hopefully
[54:45] the
[54:46] fifth wave chief wave won't be any
[54:48] different than the first right
[54:51] the tenth sheep to come maturity won't
[54:53] be any different than the first
[54:56] the first age was to not be any
[54:58] different than the first the waving the
[55:01] second age third age fourth fifth sixth
[55:03] seventh into this bright age for the
[55:05] bride today isn't to be any different
[55:08] actually supposed to be more like him
[55:09] than ever
[55:11] this age is supposed to reflect jesus
[55:13] christ more today than any age ever has
[55:16] from the first church
[55:17] of course obviously they wrote a book of
[55:19] ads from that time to this time was
[55:21] never to be but it is now and we are a
[55:24] part of it yes god has given us that
[55:26] time god has put us in this age he's put
[55:29] us in this place for that reason amen so
[55:32] that we reflect him and who he is now
[55:36] from the wave sheath to the wave loaf
[55:38] now the wave loaf we remember was the 50
[55:40] days from the wave sheath to the way
[55:42] below 50 days typifying pentecost which
[55:45] so we uh call this wave loaf the fourth
[55:50] feast
[55:51] the feast of pentecost
[55:53] or a pentecostal feeds as 50 represents
[55:56] pentecost
[55:58] pentecost as we read last week acts
[56:00] chapter 2 verses 1 and 2 3
[56:03] through 4 i believe it was where the
[56:04] holy spirit came down when they were all
[56:07] in the upper room
[56:08] and he filled all the house where they
[56:10] were sitting and the holy spirit came
[56:12] and sat upon each of them representing
[56:15] the third feast the wave sheep where the
[56:18] oil was mingled with the flower
[56:20] and then the next verse the conjunction
[56:23] says and which is a conjunction we know
[56:26] what a conjunction is correct and is a
[56:28] conjunction it's actually
[56:30] grammatically inaccurate to start a
[56:32] sentence with a conjunction but it
[56:34] doesn't matter it's the bible uh but it
[56:37] says and that's the first word
[56:39] it's a conjunction what's it doing it's
[56:42] conjoining the previous
[56:44] statement with the next statement
[56:46] the previous statement says it is sat
[56:49] upon each of them
[56:52] and joining with that and
[56:55] it went into
[56:57] each one of them
[56:59] the fulfillment of christ taken resident
[57:01] in his people the holy spirit and fire
[57:04] coming and burning out the old nature
[57:05] and taking permanent resident of your
[57:07] soul jesus christ among amen praise the
[57:10] lord on them and
[57:13] in them
[57:14] that's from the third to the fourth
[57:16] feast the waving of the sheep where
[57:18] they're least loosely bound together by
[57:20] one common thread to a baking together
[57:23] to where there is no separating but
[57:26] between christ and his bride let's just
[57:28] say it that way there's no separating
[57:30] they're one they become one and they
[57:32] will be one forever
[57:35] till their destination friend as long as
[57:38] this earth is we will be with him praise
[57:40] the lord now that's at that pentecost
[57:43] the pentecostal feast now from that
[57:45] pentecostal feast we talked about there
[57:48] was a long period of time
[57:50] a long period of time between the fourth
[57:52] feast and the fifth feast now the first
[57:54] two feasts give us months and days third
[57:57] and fourth do not but the fifth and
[57:59] sixth do
[58:01] so what are we looking at there that
[58:03] long period of time between the feast of
[58:06] pentecost the
[58:08] feast of the way blow
[58:10] offering
[58:11] unto the feast of trumpets which again
[58:14] is the 23rd verse that we started at
[58:16] so from that time to this time was a
[58:18] long period of time
[58:20] now the first two was one day
[58:23] we don't know exactly from the third to
[58:25] the fourth
[58:26] or from the second to the third or third
[58:28] to the fourth well we we don't know the
[58:30] second or third we do know the third to
[58:32] the fourth that's 50 days
[58:34] uh
[58:35] but from there
[58:36] from that fourth to the fifth
[58:39] the time period is a long you got short
[58:42] time period in the first to the fourth
[58:44] now you've got a long time period
[58:46] between the fourth and the fifth
[58:48] to the seventh month to be exact now
[58:50] let's see what brother branham says in
[58:52] the feast of the trumpets remember i
[58:54] asked see if you wanted to go home and
[58:56] try to listen to that tape this week
[58:58] maybe you did maybe you didn't if you
[58:59] had a chance then uh be a little more
[59:01] informative to you uh again the feast of
[59:04] the trumpets if you haven't or if you're
[59:06] going to just like i said take your time
[59:08] with this one uh if this is not like one
[59:11] of the prayer line meetings where
[59:13] brother brown just takes a scripture and
[59:15] just kind of gives an exhortation and
[59:17] some uh uh some story lines this is this
[59:21] is this is some serious
[59:24] uh
[59:25] ribeye steak here right here so you
[59:27] really gotta take your time and and
[59:29] digest this uh and and go through this
[59:32] feast of trump just take some notes
[59:34] write it down if you can but really go
[59:35] through it because
[59:36] uh i i've listened to it over and over
[59:39] and over again and uh the things that
[59:41] brother branham puts in here is is uh
[59:44] very specific so it's good to listen to
[59:47] but just take your time with it if you
[59:48] do hope you do notice now quickly this
[59:51] is the quote
[59:53] now quickly revelation 9 under the
[59:55] seventh trumpet their king is from the
[59:58] bottomless pits in leviticus now how
[1:00:00] perfect the interpretation here is with
[1:00:03] the word because see immediately
[1:00:05] following the pentecostal jubilee
[1:00:07] followed the day of atonement but now we
[1:00:10] haven't got to the the trumpets to the
[1:00:12] atonement yet
[1:00:14] amen which he's talking about immediate
[1:00:16] from those trumpets to that atonement
[1:00:19] was uh was a very short period of time
[1:00:21] but we haven't got that yet we'll come
[1:00:23] back to that
[1:00:25] the order of the feast time between the
[1:00:27] pentecostal feasts
[1:00:29] to the uh to the sounding of the
[1:00:31] trumpets
[1:00:33] uh for the atonement which was to bring
[1:00:35] the atonement
[1:00:36] from the from the pentecostal feast to
[1:00:38] the trump feast of the trumpets
[1:00:41] was a long period of time
[1:00:43] look there was a long period of time
[1:00:46] between the pentecostal feast
[1:00:48] and the feast of the trumpets to be
[1:00:50] sound a long period of time brother adam
[1:00:52] says frankly
[1:00:54] it was 50 days
[1:00:56] from one of the feasts of pentecost to
[1:00:59] the feast of the atonement was 50 days
[1:01:02] or the atonement came after the trumpets
[1:01:04] he keeps saying atonement but the
[1:01:06] atonement comes directly after the
[1:01:08] trumpets so when you hear brother random
[1:01:10] say atonement that's what he's talking
[1:01:12] about okay because the trumpets were
[1:01:15] merely like we talked about last week
[1:01:17] the trumpets were merely a sound that
[1:01:20] was led forth
[1:01:21] that signified to israel even back
[1:01:24] through the old testament the trumpet
[1:01:26] sounding we went kind of through this a
[1:01:28] little bit when we did the rapture
[1:01:29] message uh was sounding forth
[1:01:33] that's something to israel so that they
[1:01:35] know that there's an event going on and
[1:01:38] what to do about it it was to bring them
[1:01:40] together into a gathering
[1:01:43] to bring them from scattered around to
[1:01:45] one central location now it was applied
[1:01:49] in the old testament of something as
[1:01:51] simple as uh going to war
[1:01:53] uh we have the watchmen watching
[1:01:56] and they see the enemy approaching so
[1:01:59] they blow a trumpet
[1:02:01] a certain sound a specific sound of that
[1:02:04] trumpet to let them know it's time to
[1:02:06] gather together and prepare yourself for
[1:02:09] battle that's what the trumpet was
[1:02:11] that's just one one
[1:02:13] uh example of it was to let them know
[1:02:16] the enemy's coming gather yourself
[1:02:18] together and get prepared for battle
[1:02:20] well these trumpets was sent forth and
[1:02:24] sounded to bring israel together and fly
[1:02:27] them from the disbursement of all around
[1:02:30] the world back to their homeland again
[1:02:32] amen well god the atonement would have
[1:02:36] never happened for the jews had not they
[1:02:39] come from scattered around the world
[1:02:41] back to their homeland amen
[1:02:43] remember god only blesses israel when
[1:02:48] they're in their homeland
[1:02:50] god only deals with israel when they're
[1:02:53] in their homeland so if there was ever
[1:02:56] to come an atonement which is the sixth
[1:03:00] feast which immediately follows the
[1:03:02] trumpets
[1:03:03] the atonement for there to be an
[1:03:05] atonement they had to be in their
[1:03:07] homeland
[1:03:08] so the fifth
[1:03:09] feast the feast of the trumpets
[1:03:12] had to sound to bring israel back
[1:03:15] together again brother brahm talks about
[1:03:18] those trumpets as being uh mussolini and
[1:03:20] hitler and stalin and all those that
[1:03:23] persecuted the jews that caused the jews
[1:03:25] to go back home
[1:03:27] they were being persecuted we know all
[1:03:29] about the holocaust and uh and what took
[1:03:32] place here and many of the jews
[1:03:35] went in through the holocaust of many of
[1:03:37] them got out of there
[1:03:39] left germany
[1:03:40] left russia
[1:03:42] left from the places they had been
[1:03:44] dispersed to to go back home
[1:03:47] to be in their homeland
[1:03:49] because the 144 000 that god is to call
[1:03:53] out of this
[1:03:54] had to be there before the atonement
[1:03:56] could ever take place before god would
[1:03:58] ever even deal with them again yes
[1:04:00] before god would ever even speak to them
[1:04:02] again yes before god would ever
[1:04:05] try to even bless them again they had to
[1:04:08] be home
[1:04:10] that's why brother branham keeps talking
[1:04:12] about atonement
[1:04:13] between the pentecost to atonement well
[1:04:16] he's kind of skipping the trumpets but
[1:04:18] it's basically the trumpets brought
[1:04:21] about the atonement we'll go into that a
[1:04:23] little more in a little bit but
[1:04:25] frankly he says now 50 days
[1:04:28] 50 days from the pentecost feast of
[1:04:31] pentecost to the feast of atonement or
[1:04:33] the
[1:04:34] trumpets
[1:04:36] was 50 days
[1:04:38] now 50 days is exactly seven sabbaths
[1:04:42] with
[1:04:43] seven sabbaths is what
[1:04:45] 49 7 times 7 is 49 should ask joel that
[1:04:49] you would know that would you 7 times 7
[1:04:51] 49 50 is the one extra day what again is
[1:04:55] that that is the rolling over into the
[1:04:57] new day right the eighth day the
[1:05:00] beginning of the week
[1:05:02] again typifying that when christ was to
[1:05:05] come all the shadows and tights and
[1:05:08] new moons and and stars and sabbaths
[1:05:11] were going to be done away with we were
[1:05:13] entering into a new day
[1:05:15] amen people fighting fussing scampering
[1:05:17] everything over uh well should we
[1:05:20] worship on saturday or should we work
[1:05:21] for worship on sunday saturday's the
[1:05:24] sabbath well if you want to keep the
[1:05:25] sabbath you go right in back into the
[1:05:27] law again i don't keep a sabbath
[1:05:30] the sabbath to me is every day of my
[1:05:32] life
[1:05:33] because i've entered into a new day by
[1:05:35] the scripture by the word through jesus
[1:05:38] christ who came and gave his life and
[1:05:41] and now lives in me
[1:05:43] now every day is the sabbath we just
[1:05:45] honor his resurrection and our new
[1:05:47] beginning of this week on a sunday
[1:05:50] because that's when he raised
[1:05:52] amen not saturday not sunday people can
[1:05:54] fight those battles all they want friend
[1:05:56] but we're resting now
[1:05:58] those battles are over we know who we
[1:06:01] are and we know who we are in jesus
[1:06:03] christ
[1:06:04] amen 50 days now 49th plus the day
[1:06:07] that's 50 days your brother graham says
[1:06:08] now exactly seven sabbaths
[1:06:12] and seven sabbaths is the seven church
[1:06:15] ages
[1:06:17] the seven church ages get it he sees now
[1:06:20] he said now the jews had been blinded
[1:06:22] waiting all this time while the
[1:06:25] pentecostal first fruits has been poured
[1:06:28] out upon the church upon the bride these
[1:06:32] seven church ages seven sabbaths between
[1:06:35] the waving of the loaf or the feast of
[1:06:37] pentecost
[1:06:38] there's been seven sabbaths seven church
[1:06:42] ages typifying
[1:06:44] seven church ages from the first church
[1:06:46] age to our age today
[1:06:48] that god has been dealing with the
[1:06:50] gentile
[1:06:51] the jews were blinded not to see it
[1:06:54] right they were not to see it we'll go
[1:06:56] to
[1:06:57] into romans here uh maybe next week
[1:07:01] whatever time that it plays out in the
[1:07:03] scripture we'll go and we'll look at
[1:07:05] that probably next week
[1:07:07] uh that that god that the israel was
[1:07:09] blinded we talked about the blindness of
[1:07:11] israel yes amen and how they could not
[1:07:13] see the messiah they did not see it
[1:07:16] their eyes were their eyes were keen on
[1:07:19] something else and they did not see it
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] so they were blinded to the messiah they
[1:07:25] were blinded to jesus christ we know
[1:07:28] that
[1:07:29] uh
[1:07:30] ezekiel or zechariah excuse me zechariah
[1:07:34] 13 there would be a a period of time
[1:07:37] that would be a fountain open for the
[1:07:40] house of david well that fountain
[1:07:42] started with jesus christ
[1:07:44] but they rejected him
[1:07:46] the jews rejected him
[1:07:48] so he left from the jews and he came to
[1:07:51] the gentiles
[1:07:52] and now for 2 000 years for seven
[1:07:56] sabbaths for seven church ages god has
[1:07:59] been dealing with the gentiles and
[1:08:01] getting his gentile bride together
[1:08:04] and we're at the end of that time yes
[1:08:06] we're at the end of the time of god
[1:08:07] gathering the gentile bride together all
[1:08:11] the while
[1:08:12] israel's been in their homeland or
[1:08:13] they've been they've been uh
[1:08:16] uh going about
[1:08:18] living as as they did through the entire
[1:08:20] old testament
[1:08:22] uh being the same as they were basically
[1:08:26] the the daily oblation quit because
[1:08:29] the overrunning of the temple
[1:08:31] but
[1:08:33] their feasts and new moons and all they
[1:08:35] continue
[1:08:36] on that all this they do
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:39] because that's that's what they believe
[1:08:42] they did not see the messiah they did
[1:08:43] not know jesus christ was this messiah
[1:08:46] they were blinded to it so they've been
[1:08:48] going on like they've been going all the
[1:08:50] while god's been with the gentiles the
[1:08:52] spirit of god the anointing has been
[1:08:54] with the gentile pride and he's been
[1:08:56] calling a gentile bride out of every
[1:08:58] church age yes unto this age and god is
[1:09:01] still dealing with the gentile bride
[1:09:03] although like we said last week that
[1:09:05] spirit is lifting off the gentiles you
[1:09:08] can feel it
[1:09:09] i talked about the services i was in
[1:09:12] when i was a kid
[1:09:13] those are services my grandchildren
[1:09:15] never see
[1:09:16] because we're not in that day
[1:09:18] we're not in that time anymore they
[1:09:20] won't see those services once in a while
[1:09:22] or or actually most sundays we have a
[1:09:24] really powerful moving of the lord here
[1:09:26] but it's not like just not quite like it
[1:09:29] was then but god is still dealing with
[1:09:30] us you say well brother newton how we
[1:09:32] know when god's done dealing with the
[1:09:34] gentiles we'll be home
[1:09:36] that's how you know amen
[1:09:38] when we go home when we go to the
[1:09:40] wedding suffer god the anointing goes
[1:09:42] fully back over to the jews again and
[1:09:44] starts dealing with them now because why
[1:09:47] they're in their homeland
[1:09:49] because of the fifth feast let's read it
[1:09:54] the fifth feast starts at the 23rd verse
[1:09:57] leviticus 23 23 and the lord spake unto
[1:10:00] moses saying
[1:10:01] speak unto the children of israel saying
[1:10:03] in the seventh month
[1:10:05] in the first day of the month the first
[1:10:07] day of the seventh month
[1:10:09] um which i believe is october because
[1:10:11] again remember their first month is
[1:10:13] april so their seventh month i believe
[1:10:15] it's october uh it's the seventh month
[1:10:18] the first day
[1:10:20] of that seventh month shall you have a
[1:10:22] sabbath a
[1:10:24] memorial of a blowing of trumpets
[1:10:27] unholy
[1:10:28] convocation you shall do no several work
[1:10:31] therein but ye shall offer an offering
[1:10:33] made by fire unto the lord now again
[1:10:36] remember what was that trump what were
[1:10:38] those trumpets to do
[1:10:41] it was to gather dispersed israel back
[1:10:43] to their homeland again now
[1:10:46] all seven
[1:10:48] of the
[1:10:49] of the
[1:10:50] of the feast of trumpets was blown
[1:10:54] under our sixth seal
[1:10:57] now remember our sixth seal is what
[1:11:01] judgment
[1:11:02] tribulation
[1:11:04] where we got to last week in our
[1:11:06] understanding
[1:11:08] has the sixth seal
[1:11:12] began
[1:11:13] or has it not
[1:11:15] see that that was something i posed to
[1:11:16] you last week and my question was then
[1:11:20] do you believe that judgment is on the
[1:11:22] land today
[1:11:23] and i believe all of us believe that
[1:11:25] people get wonkas with you say the sick
[1:11:27] seal they get all crazy and
[1:11:29] because it messes people up they without
[1:11:32] a revelation
[1:11:34] you talk about the seals and and people
[1:11:36] in the message
[1:11:38] some people just they just ignore you
[1:11:40] don't want to talk about it all and some
[1:11:41] people you'll spend the next four hours
[1:11:43] if you just start one word on them and
[1:11:45] they'll give you abs their revelation of
[1:11:47] it from beginning to ending if it ever
[1:11:49] even has an end but really it's not that
[1:11:52] complicated
[1:11:54] it was open it was revealed
[1:11:56] to a prophet to bring a revelation of
[1:11:59] that word on tape on book for a bride
[1:12:02] especially for this last day
[1:12:05] so that we could recognize and
[1:12:06] understand from the first church age
[1:12:09] even from pentecost down to the church
[1:12:11] ages the advices of the enemy remember
[1:12:14] cause what is the main theme of each
[1:12:16] seal
[1:12:17] a horse rider yes well that horse rider
[1:12:20] is not jesus that horse rider is satan
[1:12:22] most of the church world believes that
[1:12:24] those horse riders the
[1:12:26] white red black they believed that was
[1:12:29] jesus but it well he said well he was on
[1:12:31] a white horse well yeah he was a
[1:12:32] hypocrite
[1:12:34] he was trying to produce or save with
[1:12:35] something he's not
[1:12:37] he's trying to pretend remember
[1:12:40] satan can can uh
[1:12:45] copy
[1:12:57] everything that jesus does except
[1:12:59] creation
[1:13:00] which is
[1:13:01] following the word he cannot keep that
[1:13:03] word word by word and the word is
[1:13:05] creation he cannot create that's why god
[1:13:08] has given that into the hands of the
[1:13:10] bride yes amen what did he say you could
[1:13:14] speak
[1:13:15] name say do what you want say this say
[1:13:18] that but you do it with the power of the
[1:13:20] anointing of the spirit of god and not
[1:13:22] by your own self do you do it by your
[1:13:24] own self
[1:13:26] things would be a mess
[1:13:28] if i tried to do it by my own it would
[1:13:30] be a mess friend because my mind would
[1:13:33] go off my human emotion too many times
[1:13:35] instead of the will of god yeah so
[1:13:38] god is we have that power but we have it
[1:13:41] only by the authority of his spirit
[1:13:45] we have
[1:13:46] we have that based on what god has given
[1:13:48] us for this last day the thing that
[1:13:50] satan cannot do so yeah he can copy him
[1:13:52] he could be on a white horse he could be
[1:13:54] on a red horse he could be on a whatever
[1:13:57] horse but we know that that horse rider
[1:13:59] is satan so the main theme of each seal
[1:14:03] was simply the horse rider
[1:14:05] amen this is just god unveiling to us so
[1:14:07] that we look back and see what the
[1:14:09] tactics of the enemy have been all the
[1:14:11] way through what he's doing today
[1:14:13] what he's going to continue to do
[1:14:16] we know the devices of the enemy there's
[1:14:18] no secret to us
[1:14:19] he can't do anything to us that we don't
[1:14:22] already know that he does as his tactics
[1:14:25] because we he's been exposed
[1:14:28] all of satan all of hell all of his
[1:14:31] tactics everything is all been exposed
[1:14:34] yes to the bride
[1:14:36] by revelation god has exposed that so
[1:14:38] that we see it so now you see that sixth
[1:14:42] seal
[1:14:43] yes that judgment so we'll say sixth
[1:14:46] seal all right just ask you do you
[1:14:48] believe judgment has been unleashed i
[1:14:50] believe every one of us will say
[1:14:51] absolutely well that's what the sixth
[1:14:53] deal is
[1:14:54] the sixth seal is judgment
[1:14:57] it ends in tribulation but the sixth
[1:14:59] seal is judgment which leads to the
[1:15:02] tribulation
[1:15:03] the tribulation is simply
[1:15:06] the finalization of it all
[1:15:08] the tribulation is what ends it
[1:15:10] completes it
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:14] well that sixth seal
[1:15:16] in this church age which began in 1906
[1:15:21] uh i believe i don't have the book with
[1:15:22] me i believe this church age 1906 from
[1:15:25] that time each of those seven trumpets
[1:15:28] have sounded for the jews
[1:15:30] in this period
[1:15:32] each of those seven trumpets has sealed
[1:15:35] the seven trumpets for the jews has
[1:15:37] sounded under our sixth seal we know the
[1:15:40] seven seals coming of the lord
[1:15:42] but those six seals of that sixth seal
[1:15:44] those seven trumpets under that sixth
[1:15:46] seal
[1:15:47] that judgment period
[1:15:50] god is taking oh listen now god is
[1:15:53] taking the jews out of that
[1:15:56] because he's sounding their trumpets to
[1:16:00] bring them to their homeland to give
[1:16:02] them a time of atonement
[1:16:05] which is the sixth they're they're six
[1:16:07] feasts
[1:16:09] their fifth feast
[1:16:11] sounding of the trumpet
[1:16:13] was to bring them to their homeland so
[1:16:15] god could unveil the
[1:16:18] sixth feast to them which is the feast
[1:16:20] of atonement listen 26th verse
[1:16:23] and the lord's speaking to moses saying
[1:16:26] also on the 10th day of this seventh
[1:16:29] month now notice
[1:16:30] this is winding up just like it began
[1:16:34] you had a quick atonement the day after
[1:16:36] the atonement is fellowship
[1:16:39] praise the lord now the day after the
[1:16:43] the trumpets are not the day after but
[1:16:45] very shortly after five days exactly or
[1:16:48] ten days what did we say here
[1:16:51] ten days because the feast of the
[1:16:53] trumpets was the first day of the
[1:16:54] seventh month the feast of atonement is
[1:16:57] the tenth day of the seventh month ten
[1:16:59] days later basically immediately right
[1:17:02] after
[1:17:03] the jews there is a period of time
[1:17:05] notice though there is a period of time
[1:17:09] that period of time to me saints from
[1:17:11] the time that that happens to the time
[1:17:13] the atonement actually begins because
[1:17:16] the atonement cannot begin
[1:17:19] until the bride the gentile bride is
[1:17:21] gone
[1:17:23] okay listen to me close now the trumpets
[1:17:25] have sounded to bring dispersed israel
[1:17:28] back to their homeland under the sixth
[1:17:31] seal yes the talmud however cannot
[1:17:35] happen for the jews
[1:17:37] until the bride is gone home
[1:17:40] because that's when the anointing goes
[1:17:43] back to the jews and god begins to deal
[1:17:46] with them and they recognize that they
[1:17:48] crucified their messiah
[1:17:50] that's why brother branham told billy
[1:17:52] paul billy
[1:17:53] if you ever seen the daily oblation of
[1:17:56] the jews back instituted again you'll
[1:17:59] know you miss the rapture
[1:18:01] because god will not deal with the jews
[1:18:03] in that capacity anymore until the
[1:18:06] gentile bride is gone
[1:18:08] god the anointing will not bring them to
[1:18:10] the point of beginning that that's why
[1:18:13] you hear so much about the red heifer
[1:18:14] and
[1:18:15] and these messages that people preach
[1:18:17] and talk about because they know the
[1:18:19] times and the seasons friend i don't
[1:18:22] i
[1:18:23] i remember
[1:18:26] years ago
[1:18:27] this red heifer that was coming up in
[1:18:30] israel oh that was gonna be the one
[1:18:33] 30 years ago we don't know
[1:18:36] we know it's going to be but we don't
[1:18:39] are the witnesses there are they not i
[1:18:41] don't know
[1:18:42] the the witnesses of revelation 11 have
[1:18:44] to be born
[1:18:45] they have to raise they have to be grown
[1:18:47] they have to be older men
[1:18:49] are they there now they probably are but
[1:18:52] i don't know
[1:18:53] is that heifer been born is it the
[1:18:55] perfect heifer for their beginning their
[1:18:57] daily sacrifice i
[1:19:00] maybe probably i don't know but i don't
[1:19:02] venture to try to guess on those things
[1:19:04] not anymore i have in the past years ago
[1:19:07] i have
[1:19:08] but i don't know that's up to god all i
[1:19:11] know is what the scripture says
[1:19:13] and the scripture says the trumpets were
[1:19:15] to bring israel together
[1:19:17] and that was under our sixth seal so
[1:19:20] judgment has began we know we can see
[1:19:23] judgment on the world today and and
[1:19:25] shall i say
[1:19:27] um
[1:19:28] i first of all want to honor 9 11.
[1:19:31] but i want to which i was going to do at
[1:19:32] the end but i didn't want to forget that
[1:19:35] but i also want to acknowledge the
[1:19:36] passing of the queen of england
[1:19:38] yes you may not think and i honestly i
[1:19:40] couldn't care less uh it's not something
[1:19:43] that has ever captivated my attention
[1:19:46] about the royal family but i do believe
[1:19:49] there's very sign very much of
[1:19:51] significance to our passing
[1:19:54] uh if it's nothing more than a passing
[1:19:56] of an old order
[1:19:58] into an ushering in of a new order
[1:20:00] i don't know
[1:20:02] but there's there's because i'm not a
[1:20:05] prophet but there's i can in my little p
[1:20:09] brain see the significance of of someone
[1:20:11] of that statue for
[1:20:13] 70 years
[1:20:15] uh now
[1:20:17] in one of the most influential countries
[1:20:18] in the world now gone
[1:20:21] what happens next oh charles was taking
[1:20:23] over well that doesn't mean anything
[1:20:25] uh his two sons are fighting like cats
[1:20:27] and dogs so i you know
[1:20:29] who knows but we do know that there's a
[1:20:32] shifting going on
[1:20:34] is it ushering in something that
[1:20:36] that that we see scripturally but we
[1:20:39] might not conceive this
[1:20:40] out here
[1:20:42] i don't know if i was a prophet i tell
[1:20:44] you i'll tell you one thing though if
[1:20:45] the lord reveals it to me i'll tell you
[1:20:48] i promise you that
[1:20:50] it's a report if the lord reveals
[1:20:51] something like that to you let me know
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:55] i'll see if it fits scripturally and
[1:20:58] we'll see but i don't know but i do
[1:21:00] believe there's some spiritual
[1:21:01] significance to that
[1:21:03] but the sounding of the trumpets was to
[1:21:05] bring her back together sixth seal
[1:21:09] but now the atonement which immediately
[1:21:11] follows but notice there is a period of
[1:21:14] time there's 10 days
[1:21:16] so there is a period of time to where
[1:21:17] israel is in their homeland
[1:21:20] they got their own flag
[1:21:23] you hear what i'm saying
[1:21:25] they got their own flag
[1:21:27] they got their own currency
[1:21:29] they are part of the what was the league
[1:21:31] of nations now i guess united nations
[1:21:34] they're recognized
[1:21:36] by the world
[1:21:38] as a country
[1:21:40] for the first time since david
[1:21:42] since they were
[1:21:44] uh 2000 for 2 000 years not david since
[1:21:47] christ for 2 000 years now they have
[1:21:49] their own flag six-point sergeant david
[1:21:52] had their own currency acknowledged
[1:21:54] worldwide as a nation they are the
[1:21:56] nation of israel and they have been for
[1:21:59] how long
[1:22:00] 70 years 60 years
[1:22:02] i lose track
[1:22:03] but it's been many years but remember
[1:22:05] there's a period of time
[1:22:07] between the trumpets blowing and
[1:22:09] bringing them back together before the
[1:22:11] atonement takes place
[1:22:13] what's god doing during that period of
[1:22:14] time he's doing the same thing that he
[1:22:15] did what we preached on a couple of
[1:22:17] weeks ago just like he did with noah
[1:22:20] god made up his mind what he was going
[1:22:22] to do he told his son what he was going
[1:22:24] to do and gave him instruction for 120
[1:22:27] years
[1:22:28] that man noah fulfilled that that
[1:22:31] instruction and built an ark
[1:22:33] he got on the ark when god told him to
[1:22:36] god shuts the door seven more days
[1:22:39] nothing
[1:22:41] no rain
[1:22:43] no judgment seven more days they sat
[1:22:45] there on the ark with no rain
[1:22:48] i mean could you imagine the scoffers
[1:22:50] today yeah if they got on that boat and
[1:22:52] you said daddy you told me now we've
[1:22:55] been here for five six days smelling the
[1:22:58] the stink of these animals when is that
[1:23:00] gonna rain are you sure you heard from
[1:23:02] god
[1:23:03] are you sure you heard the right voice
[1:23:05] you sure you weren't you know dreaming
[1:23:08] some thinking something
[1:23:09] you never know there's golfers of all
[1:23:11] kinds
[1:23:12] and i say that because people do the
[1:23:13] same thing today yeah
[1:23:16] amen because they're not on god's time
[1:23:18] schedule they're on their own time
[1:23:19] schedule
[1:23:20] friend we can't be on our own time
[1:23:22] schedule because our time schedule is
[1:23:24] not in line with god's time schedule we
[1:23:27] have to get in line with his time
[1:23:28] schedule and when he says yes
[1:23:31] you can bank it friends because it's
[1:23:32] done yes when i say yes well maybe maybe
[1:23:37] not
[1:23:38] probably not
[1:23:39] but i'm not relying on me i'm not
[1:23:41] relying on you i'm not relying on
[1:23:42] somebody that claims to be a prophet i'm
[1:23:44] relying on god's word and the vindicated
[1:23:47] prophet for this day
[1:23:48] and when god says it that settles it
[1:23:52] it's done at that point i'm finished
[1:23:55] we know that it's done so
[1:23:57] there's that period of time just like
[1:24:00] that period of time just like this
[1:24:01] period of time just like our period of
[1:24:04] time right now we're in that period of
[1:24:05] time in my opinion
[1:24:07] now
[1:24:08] i'm not saying when but in my opinion we
[1:24:11] are in that period of time and we're
[1:24:13] getting ready to go home
[1:24:14] and as soon as we go home that 10 days
[1:24:17] there's that atonement
[1:24:18] the atonement that god makes with his
[1:24:21] own people
[1:24:22] who were who were once blinded but now
[1:24:25] they can see now i'm going to read
[1:24:27] through it
[1:24:28] uh
[1:24:29] this feast of atonement the sixth feast
[1:24:31] but i'm not going to get into great
[1:24:33] detail with it because again i want to
[1:24:35] do that next week that's probably a
[1:24:37] whole other service so lord willing
[1:24:39] we'll do that next week but now feast of
[1:24:41] atonement now let's lay the groundwork
[1:24:43] really quick one more time
[1:24:45] feast of atonement follows immediately
[1:24:47] after or ten days after the feast of the
[1:24:50] trumpets which brought israel back
[1:24:51] together which was at the end of the
[1:24:55] gentile dispensation
[1:24:57] okay so that
[1:24:59] now
[1:25:00] the bride is in its
[1:25:04] ark uh in the ark waiting time
[1:25:08] basically when we're getting ready to go
[1:25:10] home to go to the marriage supper of the
[1:25:12] lamb
[1:25:14] and at the time that the bride leaves
[1:25:17] the full anointing of christ the holy
[1:25:19] spirit goes back to the jews and god
[1:25:22] deals with the jews and this feast of
[1:25:24] atonement sets in crosses over from
[1:25:27] feasts of trumpets to feast of atonement
[1:25:29] when the feast of atonement sets into
[1:25:31] the jews then god begins to reveal
[1:25:34] himself to them people and they
[1:25:35] recognize they crucify their messiah
[1:25:38] amen now
[1:25:40] what is atonement
[1:25:43] atonement is to atone for something when
[1:25:46] you try to atone for something you did
[1:25:49] wrong you try to make amends
[1:25:52] you apologize you restore make
[1:25:55] reparations of some kind you restore
[1:25:58] back because you want to make an
[1:26:00] atonement for something you personally
[1:26:02] did wrong
[1:26:03] if i uh
[1:26:04] uh if if in my previous life i'll just
[1:26:07] say i stole ten dollars from somebody
[1:26:09] and god put it on my heart i'd know that
[1:26:11] person or go to apologize getting that
[1:26:13] ten dollars maybe give twenty dollars
[1:26:15] to atone for what i had done wrong
[1:26:18] i wanna make right
[1:26:20] what i had done wrong what did they do
[1:26:22] wrong
[1:26:23] they didn't see recognize their messiah
[1:26:27] so because they didn't they crucified
[1:26:29] him
[1:26:30] and they screamed let his blood be on us
[1:26:32] and on our children
[1:26:34] i mean you would think that was
[1:26:37] that was a sin that would be
[1:26:39] unatonable
[1:26:41] it's a sin today that a lot of people
[1:26:43] would say oh that person did something i
[1:26:45] could never forgive them
[1:26:46] i could never forgive somebody of that
[1:26:49] then you won't be forgiven either for
[1:26:51] the things you've done right
[1:26:53] if you can't forgive you can't be
[1:26:55] forgiven
[1:26:56] so
[1:26:57] this falls into that position this falls
[1:26:59] into that place
[1:27:00] notice so
[1:27:02] when when this happens and they
[1:27:05] recognize they had killed their messiah
[1:27:07] their eyes open and they see it there's
[1:27:09] an atonement made
[1:27:11] they make atonement for what they've
[1:27:14] done wrong they try to atone for the
[1:27:16] mistakes they had made
[1:27:18] in whatever capacity that is acceptable
[1:27:20] to the lord and again we'll talk about
[1:27:22] next week is acceptable to the lord is
[1:27:25] what they have to atone for
[1:27:27] amen remember in the garden of eden what
[1:27:29] was the atonement in the garden to be
[1:27:32] first of all there's repentance there's
[1:27:34] apology i'm sorry
[1:27:36] which unfortunately a lot of people
[1:27:39] don't seem to know how to say anymore
[1:27:42] it seems like the two hardest the four
[1:27:44] hardest words to say are grouped in twos
[1:27:46] i'm sorry and i was wrong that's three
[1:27:48] words
[1:27:49] i'm sorry and i was wrong those are five
[1:27:52] words people don't seem to know today
[1:27:54] but it's still true anyway because
[1:27:56] they're still all human yeah there's a
[1:27:58] nice sorry there's an apology and an
[1:28:00] atonement made what was the atonement
[1:28:02] made for them in the garden of eden god
[1:28:04] took the sheep he killed the two lambs
[1:28:07] who had to pay the price for what they
[1:28:09] had done wrong and threw the sheepskin
[1:28:11] out to adam and eve there had to be an
[1:28:13] atonement made there has to be an
[1:28:15] atonement here to make up for what they
[1:28:18] did wrong when they crucified their
[1:28:20] messiah
[1:28:21] they didn't see him now blinding
[1:28:23] now let's read it so as that said we
[1:28:26] recognize we're entering into this this
[1:28:28] atonement scripturally
[1:28:31] the bride is gone jesus as the marriage
[1:28:33] suffered lamb and the lord speaking to
[1:28:35] moses saying
[1:28:36] also on the tenth day of this month
[1:28:38] there shall be a day of atonement it
[1:28:41] shall be in holy convocation unto you
[1:28:43] and ye shall afflict your souls
[1:28:45] afflict your souls and offer an offering
[1:28:49] made by fire unto the lord while they
[1:28:50] have to flee their souls because of the
[1:28:52] wrong they had done
[1:28:54] make it right and you shall do no work
[1:28:57] in that same day for it is a day of
[1:28:59] atonement to make an atonement for you
[1:29:01] before the lord your god
[1:29:03] for whatsoever soul it be
[1:29:05] that shall not be afflicted in that same
[1:29:08] day he shall be cut off from among the
[1:29:11] people so the atonement has to be
[1:29:14] recognized by god among his people if
[1:29:17] it's not
[1:29:19] those people get cut off
[1:29:21] but we know
[1:29:22] there's only 144 000 anyway right
[1:29:25] and whatsoever so it be that doeth any
[1:29:28] work in that same day the same soul will
[1:29:31] i destroy from among his people you
[1:29:34] shall do matter no manner of work it
[1:29:36] shall be a a statue forever throughout
[1:29:40] your generations in all your dwellings
[1:29:42] it shall be to you a sabbath of rest and
[1:29:45] ye shall afflict your souls in the ninth
[1:29:47] day of the of the month at even from
[1:29:50] even until from even unto even
[1:29:54] shall ye celebrate your sabbath now
[1:29:56] there's one more thing i want to bring
[1:29:58] out here
[1:30:00] that i want to type with the gentiles
[1:30:02] and and then we'll close
[1:30:04] because the next thing basically takes
[1:30:06] us over to daniel 9 which puts us into
[1:30:09] the seven-fold vision of gabriel to
[1:30:11] daniel
[1:30:13] that is your
[1:30:15] not homework for this week if you want
[1:30:17] to listen daniel 70 weeks or day or or
[1:30:20] or specifically gabriel's six-fold
[1:30:23] vision to daniel gabriel six full vision
[1:30:25] to daniel and we'll be here with what
[1:30:28] we're gonna talk about next week
[1:30:29] starting daniel 9 24. but i want one i
[1:30:32] want to bring forth one more thing
[1:30:34] uh that before i close here now we
[1:30:37] notice as the feast of the trumpets to
[1:30:40] the feast of the atonement is a very
[1:30:42] short period of time 10 days it's
[1:30:44] basically immediately following week and
[1:30:47] a half after the trump uh a trumpets to
[1:30:50] the from the trumpet to the atonement
[1:30:52] very short period of time so we notice
[1:30:54] that
[1:30:55] this long period of time that god deals
[1:30:57] with the gentiles it's been two thousand
[1:31:00] years seven sabbaths seven church ages
[1:31:03] that that from the time that god turned
[1:31:05] uh they crucified christ to the time
[1:31:08] that we're living in now is that long
[1:31:11] period of time so you had the first
[1:31:14] feast you had a you had a day of
[1:31:17] redemption then a day of fellowship
[1:31:19] those followed immediately
[1:31:21] after that you had that wave offering of
[1:31:24] the one that came to maturity not just
[1:31:26] to talk uh not just redemption not just
[1:31:29] fellowship
[1:31:30] but you have uh
[1:31:32] a a a completion of coming to maturity
[1:31:36] then you have a baking in of the two
[1:31:39] becoming one through the wave offering
[1:31:41] then you've got a bringing together the
[1:31:43] feast of the trumpets and sounding them
[1:31:45] all in together those first few are bam
[1:31:48] bam god does immediately quick works
[1:31:52] but then all of a sudden you've got this
[1:31:53] long period of time
[1:31:55] that the jews have gone along the way
[1:31:57] they've gone for the past two thousand
[1:31:59] years as god's dealt with the gentiles
[1:32:01] that's going along
[1:32:02] but i want you to know something
[1:32:04] at the end of this time
[1:32:06] from the time that god's calling his
[1:32:09] jews his people back to their homeland
[1:32:12] to the atonement is a very quick work
[1:32:15] yes god does a very quick powerful work
[1:32:18] right there for the jews right all
[1:32:20] together after this long period of time
[1:32:22] god doesn't waste any more time
[1:32:24] he calls them together and he gives the
[1:32:27] atonement the atonement takes place in
[1:32:29] that very short period of time god does
[1:32:31] a quick powerful work right then what
[1:32:33] did brother branham say that god was
[1:32:35] going to do for the gentile bride at the
[1:32:36] end of our dispensation
[1:32:39] amen
[1:32:41] he said this bride will do a quick
[1:32:44] powerful work at the end
[1:32:46] everybody's waiting waiting waiting
[1:32:47] looking people get all confused people
[1:32:50] get ahead of themselves people
[1:32:52] try to push things forward well it's now
[1:32:54] it's going to be here and try to make
[1:32:56] things happen that aren't there uh it
[1:32:58] may be a right thing but a wrong time
[1:33:00] and trying to do all these things and
[1:33:02] we're waiting and waiting and waiting
[1:33:04] but when it comes to that time friend
[1:33:06] there's a quick powerful work that this
[1:33:08] bride is going to do now people say it's
[1:33:10] going to take a great persecution to
[1:33:12] bring that uh the bride's going to have
[1:33:14] to be in concentration camps and things
[1:33:17] like that and
[1:33:18] i personally don't believe that i know
[1:33:20] what brother graham said about it i also
[1:33:22] know brother graham said god doesn't put
[1:33:24] his wife through a bunch of punishment
[1:33:26] once he marries her
[1:33:28] he said what man says i do and loves his
[1:33:31] wife so much he would uh
[1:33:34] reject every other woman in the world to
[1:33:36] take this woman and say i do and take
[1:33:37] her home and beat her into a pole
[1:33:41] well god doesn't do that either
[1:33:43] a man
[1:33:44] now some reprobate might do something
[1:33:46] like that but a man doesn't do that he
[1:33:49] loves that woman
[1:33:51] he's gonna he's gonna be more
[1:33:53] affectionate with her after the wedding
[1:33:55] than he ever has been before
[1:33:57] he's not gonna take her and beat her up
[1:34:00] well i don't think god does that to his
[1:34:02] bride either god didn't marry this
[1:34:04] gentile bride just to take her and beat
[1:34:05] her around a while
[1:34:07] he's going to protect her
[1:34:09] he's going to keep her watch over her
[1:34:11] amen now
[1:34:13] if people think there's
[1:34:15] i'm not saying there's not a persecution
[1:34:18] i'm not saying there's not going to be
[1:34:19] some pressure
[1:34:20] but i'm not saying it's but i'm saying
[1:34:22] is in my opinion it's not going to be to
[1:34:24] the degree that a lot of people say that
[1:34:26] it is and a lot of ministers i've heard
[1:34:28] preach that it is
[1:34:29] i really don't
[1:34:31] but but it will be what it needs to be
[1:34:33] to bring this bride to the place of
[1:34:35] rapturing faith rapturing faith doesn't
[1:34:38] come from pressure friends rapturing
[1:34:40] faith comes by preaching the pure
[1:34:42] unadulterated word
[1:34:44] faith comes by hearing and hearing the
[1:34:46] word not from pressure
[1:34:50] all pressure does is force people into
[1:34:53] doing things
[1:34:55] god doesn't force people into doing
[1:34:57] things
[1:34:58] we do it he he brings us along to where
[1:35:02] in our hearts we desire to do things and
[1:35:05] we live the way we live and we do the
[1:35:07] things we do because we want to because
[1:35:09] we love him because we want to please
[1:35:10] him not because he's going to beat us to
[1:35:12] a pope
[1:35:14] not because he forces us to do something
[1:35:18] no
[1:35:19] because we want to because we love him
[1:35:22] and faith just like rapturing faith
[1:35:25] comes by preaching and hearing the pure
[1:35:28] unadulterated word of god
[1:35:30] that's where faith comes from and if a
[1:35:33] rapture
[1:35:34] is going to take faith like we've never
[1:35:37] had before
[1:35:38] then where is it going to come from it's
[1:35:40] not going to come from pressure it's not
[1:35:42] going to come from persecution it's
[1:35:44] going to come because of the of the pure
[1:35:47] unadulterated word the hearing of that
[1:35:50] pure word is what's going to bring the
[1:35:52] faith
[1:35:53] amen now i'm not negating there might be
[1:35:55] a little pressure and i'm not saying
[1:35:57] that there really already is
[1:35:59] i mean even in this religious loving
[1:36:02] country
[1:36:03] this country if you look at the
[1:36:05] the the hierarchy and the overwhelming
[1:36:08] things going on in the entertainment
[1:36:10] sports and things in this world
[1:36:12] they hold up the
[1:36:14] the muslims and hindus more than they do
[1:36:16] the christians now
[1:36:19] you're the hated and persecuted group
[1:36:21] many times over
[1:36:23] there is a persecution already going on
[1:36:26] around the world and that's another
[1:36:27] thing we can't forget friend
[1:36:29] this bride is not just in this room
[1:36:32] right god's bride is not just in tucson
[1:36:34] or arizona this bride is not just in the
[1:36:36] united states god's bride is
[1:36:38] international
[1:36:40] and a part of god's bride portions of
[1:36:42] god's bride are going through serious
[1:36:44] persecution right now
[1:36:46] religiously physically persecuted
[1:36:49] because they believe this message
[1:36:51] because they believe christ
[1:36:53] they're being persecuted right now right
[1:36:56] well if they're part of this body aren't
[1:36:57] we all a part of the same body
[1:36:59] so we can't forget that either yeah the
[1:37:02] bride internationally is going through
[1:37:04] some persecution amen it's getting worse
[1:37:07] in this country it will continue to get
[1:37:09] worse how much i don't know
[1:37:12] but i know that faith rapturing faith
[1:37:14] will come because of the word
[1:37:16] hearing of the word not through
[1:37:18] persecution not through pressure any of
[1:37:21] those things be some sure
[1:37:23] but i i again to to the degree that a
[1:37:26] lot of people say i don't know but it's
[1:37:28] going to be for this gentile bride just
[1:37:30] like the jews it will be a quick and
[1:37:34] powerful work at this last time
[1:37:36] it'll be a quick work friend this bride
[1:37:38] will do a quick and powerful work and
[1:37:40] then she's gone yes amen well that quick
[1:37:43] powerful beat during that time where the
[1:37:45] dead and christ are here for that 40
[1:37:47] minimum 40 days or minutes and 30 days
[1:37:50] are here and we're all together will
[1:37:51] that be that time i don't know i know
[1:37:54] that brittle graham said there will be
[1:37:55] that time so i believe there will be
[1:37:57] that time and the scriptural precedent
[1:38:00] to show us that that is scriptural not
[1:38:03] just something brother branham said
[1:38:05] their scriptural precedent to back up
[1:38:07] that claimed of that quick powerful work
[1:38:10] he's going to do it for us we're going
[1:38:12] home then he's doing it for the jews and
[1:38:14] then they go home praise the lord amen
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:18] and at the end of the wedding supper
[1:38:20] marriage up to the lamb christ leaves he
[1:38:22] slips out from from the supper and he
[1:38:25] goes and reveals himself to the jews and
[1:38:26] they said where'd you get those scars in
[1:38:28] the house of my friends yes amen then
[1:38:30] they're gone too and uh then we go to a
[1:38:33] millennium and gog and magog and the
[1:38:36] white throne judgment
[1:38:38] and into eternity praise the lord
[1:38:40] amen that's where we're headed friends
[1:38:42] that is our new big that is our real new
[1:38:44] beginning it's when eternity sets in
[1:38:47] praise the lord that true eighth day
[1:38:50] amen will begin that time that god give
[1:38:53] us
[1:38:54] amen let's stand if we could
[1:39:04] amen
[1:39:06] lord willing then
[1:39:08] we'll uh
[1:39:10] we'll get to that place that atonement
[1:39:15] the atonement will
[1:39:17] the atonement generally as we know
[1:39:19] deals with the jews
[1:39:21] but it will be
[1:39:23] uh there will be uh there are types in
[1:39:25] there that helps us to see
[1:39:27] what it what it means to us as gentiles
[1:39:30] too
[1:39:31] amen that atonement what god does for
[1:39:33] them
[1:39:34] see god god is no respecter of a person
[1:39:39] those are his people but he doesn't
[1:39:40] respect him any more than he does over
[1:39:42] us
[1:39:43] or vice a person
[1:39:44] there's no respect more for the gentiles
[1:39:46] over the jews either
[1:39:48] he's no respecter of person he holds one
[1:39:50] over the other does not hold one over
[1:39:52] the other so
[1:39:54] as he does for one uh we see as he
[1:39:57] typically does for the other
[1:39:59] amen
[1:40:01] praise the lord

[1:43:43] holy his word is so bright
[1:43:46] you know from genesis 1 to revelation 22
[1:43:48] it just doesn't change
[1:43:50] amen people may look at it and think it
[1:43:52] changes they may think it alters here
[1:43:55] there contradicts here there it is so
[1:43:57] beautifully perfect
[1:43:59] no way that men
[1:44:02] from
[1:44:02] that many generations over that span of
[1:44:05] time
[1:44:06] can write such a perfect word that fits
[1:44:08] so perfectly together without a divine
[1:44:11] being instrumenting it
[1:44:14] no way
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:16] i like what brother green used to say
[1:44:18] it said thinking about the big bang is
[1:44:20] like thinking you could throw a stick of
[1:44:21] dynamite in the print shop come out with
[1:44:23] this bible
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:27] i like that that's the truth
[1:44:29] take a stick of dynamite throw at the
[1:44:31] print shop and come out with this bible
[1:44:32] that's about the equivalent of what they
[1:44:34] consider the big bang
[1:44:36] amen you ever thought about that a human
[1:44:38] being what we're made of and all the i
[1:44:42] don't give us it just blows my mind amen
[1:44:46] this blows my mind god is so good isn't
[1:44:48] he amen
[1:44:50] god bless you appreciate you love you
[1:44:52] thank you for your prayers

[1:45:02] was instructed not to give you the whole
[1:45:04] course
[1:45:05] i'll give you a brief synopsis i left
[1:45:07] here uh me and my wife when we had
[1:45:10] dinner cracker i went up to phoenix my
[1:45:13] flight was delayed from
[1:45:15] seven ish to nine
[1:45:17] he already knew i was gonna get in late
[1:45:19] so
[1:45:19] i was supposed to get there midnight get
[1:45:21] to the hotel about one
[1:45:23] uh well the flight didn't leave did we
[1:45:26] didn't start boarding until about nine
[1:45:28] the plane was coming from dallas wasn't
[1:45:30] there um we were leaving at nine o'clock
[1:45:34] and we got on the plane and everybody
[1:45:36] was set and ready to go we got almost to
[1:45:38] the to the runway and he stops and i'm
[1:45:41] sitting here thinking what is he
[1:45:42] stopping for he had a plane stop all the
[1:45:44] time on the runway but not in this
[1:45:46] particular area
[1:45:48] and there's no movement nothing going on
[1:45:49] like what why is he seeing he sat there
[1:45:51] for five minutes or ten minutes why is
[1:45:54] he stopped and all of a sudden he comes
[1:45:56] on the intercom and says there's a
[1:45:58] problem with one of the passenger
[1:46:00] manifests or something we gotta turn
[1:46:01] around and go back to the gate
[1:46:04] so he turned around after already being
[1:46:06] delayed first time i've been on a plane
[1:46:08] a pilot literally did this made a u-turn
[1:46:11] i've had him do this stuff he literally
[1:46:14] turned his wheels and we did this and
[1:46:15] went straight back to the gate
[1:46:17] it was ten o'clock before we actually
[1:46:20] left
[1:46:21] it
[1:46:22] was
[1:46:24] three o'clock before i got to
[1:46:25] minneapolis
[1:46:27] and it was 4 30 by the time i got to bed
[1:46:30] i had to get up at 6. so i got about an
[1:46:32] hour's sleep
[1:46:34] and i tell you that not to have sympathy
[1:46:36] but to thank you for your prayers
[1:46:38] because i woke up an hour after i went

[1:50:52] 11.
[1:50:53] uh i i'm sure it's one of those days
[1:50:56] where all of us can probably remember
[1:50:58] who we were when we first heard about it
[1:51:00] um
[1:51:01] i know that we were
[1:51:03] in the chapel at the tabernacle upstairs
[1:51:06] it was the first year of the school we
[1:51:08] had just started the school and i was
[1:51:09] having bible lessons in the morning and
[1:51:12] rich giaverdi came in and told us about
[1:51:14] it
[1:51:15] when all the kids were sitting there
[1:51:17] that's first i heard that's when i first
[1:51:18] heard about it a lot a lot of lives were
[1:51:21] lost that day and a lot of people still
[1:51:23] suffering from that uh still
[1:51:26] people i think sick or cancer whatever
[1:51:29] from breathing stuff and it's uh it was
[1:51:33] so the death toll has been way more than
[1:51:34] 3 000 actually it's been in multiple
[1:51:37] thousands beyond that i couldn't even
[1:51:39] begin to say but please remember those
[1:51:41] families and people that lost those
[1:51:43] loved ones also
[1:51:44] and i'm sorry that i didn't mention this
[1:51:46] but brother dave williamson wanted me to
[1:51:49] mention to each one of you to pray for a
[1:51:51] lady named grace in north carolina
[1:51:53] she had a severe
[1:51:56] friend of his name grace in charlotte in

[1:53:03] the
[1:53:05] passing of the queen and the
[1:53:07] new king
[1:53:10] i noticed that one person
[1:53:13] followed up
[1:53:15] god bless the king
[1:53:19] god bless our kingdom
[1:53:21] amen praise the lord
[1:53:30] i don't know
[1:53:32] she was quite the woman she had quite a
[1:53:35] uh all i know about her uh
[1:53:40] she held a standard
[1:53:42] serious standard for that for those
[1:53:44] people and i'm sorry but i'm just afraid
[1:53:46] the man that's in there now is not going
[1:53:48] to right
[1:53:50] he says he'll be fidelity to his nation
[1:53:53] but he wasn't even that way to his wife
[1:53:54] so i don't know how it's going to work
[1:53:56] but anyway
[1:53:57] that's something else
[1:53:59] but it's a new yeah
[1:54:01] exactly and we'll see where the lord
[1:54:03] takes it from here
[1:54:05] amen
[1:54:06] i don't know if you've
[1:54:17] yeah i mean i
[1:54:19] christian not i don't know
[1:54:21] obviously the way she looked and all but
[1:54:23] hey that's you know
[1:54:27] as old as she is she could have been
[1:54:28] from another age too we don't know but i
[1:54:30] just know that all of my life
[1:54:33] and and they probably held it close to
[1:54:35] the vest i'm sure but i never heard one
[1:54:39] bad thing about her and and all you know
[1:54:42] how tabloid is and everything
[1:54:44] but that she really held a standard for
[1:54:46] those people to look up to she was
[1:54:48] she was a ladies lady
[1:54:52] yes
[1:54:54] when
[1:54:56] there was a prophecy that she was going
[1:54:58] to go and that she was ready now and
[1:55:01] that the lord was going to take her and
[1:55:03] then and then the lord took her you know
[1:55:06] within a short period of time and then
[1:55:09] um
[1:55:10] and i think it's
[1:55:11] also
[1:55:13] the
[1:55:14] watching this time this new beginning
[1:55:16] and and with rosh hashanah
[1:55:19] that the people are
[1:55:21] then now they have this new king it's a
[1:55:23] new beginning here as well
[1:55:26] and that and that
[1:55:28] she was and
[1:55:30] the lord said she's ready now to go and
[1:55:32] that's what he told the problem she's
[1:55:34] ready now
[1:55:35] so
[1:55:36] she's been sick for a while if all of
[1:55:38] you
[1:55:39] hear of it i don't follow it again
[1:55:41] but it's in my news feed she'd been sick
[1:55:44] there was stuff that had to cancel
[1:55:45] months ago because she was really sick
[1:55:48] and they thought she was going to go
[1:55:49] then
[1:55:50] this was several months ago so i i
[1:55:53] wasn't completely surprised 96 i mean
[1:55:55] people say i was surprised she's 96 and
[1:55:58] you were
[1:55:58] surprised uh it's been sick for months
[1:56:02] but anyway so
[1:56:04] accolades to her
[1:56:06] amen
[1:56:07] so
[1:56:08] i'm not gonna call her godly woman but
[1:56:10] she held a standard of morals um
[1:56:15] so anyway but
[1:56:16] praise the lord so god reaches that
[1:56:18] should appreciate each one of you come

[1:57:58] just
[1:58:00] scripture being fulfilled your bible is
[1:58:03] being fulfilled before our very eyes and
[1:58:07] lord i i saw that
[1:58:09] when revelation comes forth the devil
[1:58:12] doesn't like it and how many
[1:58:14] kids today were just restless and going
[1:58:17] back and forth we need to interpret and
[1:58:21] understand how the enemy works we need

[1:58:42] prophets say earlier this week there's a
[1:58:45] famine in the land not necessarily
[1:58:48] for food but for um
[1:58:51] for the
[1:58:52] preaching of the true word of god amen
[1:58:55] and how many of us are really
[1:58:58] not concerned and
[1:59:00] we don't bother hearing tapes and
[1:59:03] reading our bibles and praying and even
[1:59:06] becoming a church
[1:59:08] father and and just doing what's right
[1:59:11] in obedience to your words i heard your
[1:59:15] prophet say father it's not the big
[1:59:18] things we do for god it's the little
[1:59:20] things we leave undone and this is not a
[1:59:23] time just to come and warm a sea it's a
[1:59:26] time to
[1:59:28] to be
[1:59:29] steadfast in our faith to
[1:59:32] hear your word faith cometh by hearing
[1:59:34] and hearing of the word of god and you
[1:59:37] even taught us when you defeated the
[1:59:39] enemy you spoke the word father it is
[1:59:43] written amen it is written and father
[1:59:46] you could have just spoken one word and
[1:59:48] put the devil out of existence once and
[1:59:52] for all but you showed us is
[1:59:54] we have to stand with your words
[1:59:57] we are a blessed people yes we have been
[2:00:01] called
[2:00:02] to the greatest message that you have
[2:00:05] sent forth in this day and hour that we

[2:00:12] moses and all the prophets couldn't
[2:00:15] preach the completion of the revelation
[2:00:19] of your word and your pride for this
[2:00:22] hour it's christ in you the hope of
