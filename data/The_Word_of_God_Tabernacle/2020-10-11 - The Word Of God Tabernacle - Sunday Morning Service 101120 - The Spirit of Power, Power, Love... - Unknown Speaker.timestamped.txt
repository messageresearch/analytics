[37:24] appreciate each one of you coming being
[37:26] here today those who may be on the
[37:27] stream
[37:28] maybe watch it archived god bless you
[37:31] today
[37:32] um i had intended uh got together a
[37:36] little message and thought the lord put
[37:37] on my heart
[37:38] for today sort of with the thought that
[37:41] my
[37:42] recovery from my pulled tooth i had
[37:44] tuesday most of you know
[37:45] has been a little slower than i had
[37:47] expected
[37:48] i guess last time i had a tooth pull was
[37:50] about 10 years ago and
[37:52] age does make a difference i guess but
[37:54] this has been a little more
[37:56] uh struggling uh been a little longer to
[37:59] heal
[37:59] still having pain with it and i've
[38:03] worked
[38:03] since tuesday really keep my heart rate
[38:06] down
[38:07] uh so that it you know didn't start uh
[38:10] my
[38:10] heart pumping and the blood flowing and
[38:12] it would start throbbing
[38:14] uh i met sonia with a case of water down
[38:16] the stairs i brought the
[38:18] case of water the stairs and it just
[38:19] started pounding um a couple days ago
[38:22] so but uh you know i i came in here and
[38:27] that was my intention even sonya said
[38:28] take it easy this morning i said well
[38:30] you know
[38:31] it's up to the lord that's not up to me
[38:32] but my intention is to do that
[38:35] uh but as soon as the first song started
[38:38] to be sung and i felt the spirit come
[38:40] the pain left and i feel great
[38:42] so we'll just see what the lord's got in
[38:44] store today but
[38:46] appreciate the lord being present with
[38:47] us but uh god's been good amen
[38:50] and i'm so thankful that appreciate your
[38:52] prayers uh you know when you come out of
[38:54] that anointing things do change
[38:56] uh when you're under that anointing so
[38:58] but i just believe that it's
[39:00] it's going fine it's just slower than i
[39:02] i anticipated
[39:04] uh before i had teeth pulled uh closed
[39:06] up pretty quick within a couple days no
[39:08] pain after a couple days and things like
[39:10] that but
[39:11] uh this has been going on a week and so
[39:13] uh just a little
[39:14] slower than i thought but um but i
[39:18] appreciate the lord's
[39:19] healing that he put in our bodies it's
[39:21] amazing that people
[39:22] don't believe in god and just think that
[39:25] this is some kind of an
[39:26] intelligent design or whatever they call
[39:28] it and i'm thinking friends this is
[39:31] this is beyond intelligent design this
[39:34] body and our brains and our function
[39:36] everything about it is
[39:38] transcends an intelligent design uh
[39:41] intelligent designs is what people try
[39:43] to come up with today with uh
[39:45] uh ai artificial intelligence they can't
[39:48] even come close to what god did when he
[39:50] created us
[39:51] but amen but so i'm thankful that uh the
[39:54] healing of the lord has
[39:56] touched it so i appreciate your prayers
[39:58] amen today so
[39:59] let's stand to our feet if we could and
[40:02] i'm going to turn over to the scripture
[40:07] to ii timothy
[40:14] please pardon me if i reach in for my
[40:16] for my water a little more frequently
[40:19] meds kind of give me dry mouth and
[40:22] so um working against that too
[40:29] but i believe and thank god for healing
[40:31] amen amen i appreciate brother roger
[40:33] came yesterday i didn't even know he was
[40:34] going to do it he put all the tiles in
[40:36] well not all of them but all the full
[40:38] ones put all the tiles in and set the
[40:40] air and also
[40:41] events i appreciate brother roger doing
[40:43] that he did it by himself yesterday he
[40:45] didn't even tell me he was going to do
[40:46] it
[40:47] not that i've really been able to do it
[40:49] anyway but
[40:51] i appreciate brother roger doing that
[40:52] getting the tiles and putting them in it
[40:54] just makes it look a lot better really
[40:57] and look a lot better we get those
[40:58] pieces done so
[41:00] but uh appreciate brother roger for
[41:02] doing that thank the lord for
[41:03] touching um presidents and the first
[41:05] lady and
[41:06] uh apparently he's announced today he's
[41:08] covered free now so
[41:10] uh and had very little few symptoms
[41:13] uh so i appreciate that god's just been
[41:16] good to us
[41:17] lord knows whatever his will is is going
[41:19] to be done so we'll just trust
[41:21] you for that amen second timothy we're
[41:23] going to go to the first chapter begin
[41:25] with the sixth verse
[41:26] but before we read that we just bow our
[41:28] heads again for another word of prayer
[41:32] lord jesus truly you have given life to
[41:35] us today
[41:36] life eternal it's a life lord that
[41:38] transcends anything that we could think
[41:40] of
[41:40] or believe in or hope for and god is
[41:43] it's way beyond even as paul said
[41:45] what i can see ear could hear what we
[41:47] could even imagine with our
[41:49] minds lord what you have for us we thank
[41:51] you god for this time of fellowship we
[41:53] thank you for being here

[43:09] the world we commit it to you now and
[43:11] ask your blessings
[43:12] upon the remaining part of it as we
[43:14] committed to you for your glory and
[43:15] honor in the name of the lord jesus
[43:17] christ we pray
[43:18] amen amen amen amen first
[43:21] second timothy chapter one
[43:26] i'm going to begin reading with verse
[43:27] six now
[43:30] wherefore i put thee in remembrance that
[43:32] thou stir up the gift of god which is in
[43:34] thee by the putting on of my hands
[43:37] for god hath not given us the spirit of
[43:39] fear but of
[43:41] power and of love and of a sound mind
[43:44] be not there therefore ashamed of the
[43:46] testimony of our lord
[43:48] nor me his prisoner be there
[43:51] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[43:55] of the gospel according to the power of
[43:56] god
[43:57] you can be seated if you'd like
[44:01] amen uh charismatic realms even
[44:05] sometimes i've
[44:06] had people in the message come and try
[44:08] to make me believe or feel like that the
[44:10] sixth verse was pertaining to
[44:12] uh the impartation of gifts is the
[44:15] laying on of hands
[44:17] and i beg to differ with anyone that
[44:20] takes that stance
[44:22] because if you look at this and you read
[44:25] the scripture the way that it is written
[44:27] it does not say that he is imparting a
[44:29] gift to timothy
[44:31] he's saying he's stirring up the gift
[44:33] that timothy already has
[44:35] by the laying on of hands so the laying
[44:37] on of hands is not an
[44:39] impartation of gift like a lot of the
[44:41] charismatics and
[44:42] and all would believe uh pentecostals
[44:45] and such
[44:45] it's just a stirring of a gift it's an
[44:48] acknowledgement
[44:49] of a gift that uh that timothy had that
[44:51] that paul was acknowledging into him of
[44:53] course you read the
[44:54] prior scriptures you see he talked about
[44:56] his grandmother eunice and his
[44:58] uh lois and his mother eunice uh being
[45:01] stirred with that gift that gift of
[45:02] faith
[45:04] the gift that was in timothy was a
[45:05] different gift but then
[45:08] paul helps timothy understand something
[45:11] and i believe that the lord was one to
[45:13] get across to us today and that's in the
[45:15] seventh verse
[45:17] because he tells timothy again wherefore
[45:19] i put the remembrance stir up that gift
[45:21] stir up that gift of god which is
[45:23] in you so the gift is already there the
[45:25] laying on of the hands was the
[45:27] acknowledgement of that gift the
[45:28] recognition of that gift the stirring of
[45:30] that gift
[45:32] and then he goes on to help timothy
[45:34] understand
[45:35] timothy god has not given us the spirit
[45:39] of fear
[45:39] right right amen so what he's telling
[45:42] timothy is
[45:43] that you are to be courageous timothy
[45:45] you are to take the gift that god has
[45:48] given you
[45:48] and be courageous with it don't be
[45:51] fearful of it don't be fearful of people
[45:53] don't be fearful of what might happen to
[45:55] you
[45:56] don't be fearful of what government
[45:58] might do or say to you but be courageous
[46:01] and go forward
[46:02] and and exercise the gift that's put in
[46:04] your life
[46:05] i'm putting hands on you to stir that
[46:07] gift up now let that gift flow through
[46:10] you let that gift
[46:11] manifest through you so that others
[46:12] could be blessed by it
[46:14] because god did not now that was the
[46:18] context by the scripture
[46:20] but what i want to talk about is to us
[46:22] today
[46:23] i wanted us to focus on that seventh
[46:25] verse
[46:26] and see that god has not given us the
[46:30] spirit of fear
[46:31] amen amen god has not given us the
[46:33] spirit of fear
[46:35] he has given us the spirit of power he
[46:38] has given us the spirit of love amen and
[46:40] he has given us the spirit
[46:42] of a sound mind that's right now we know
[46:44] that
[46:45] power without character is satanic right
[46:47] so
[46:48] if he gives us the power coming with
[46:51] that power
[46:51] has to be the spirit of love and of
[46:53] sound mind because the love and the
[46:56] sound mind
[46:56] is what constitutes somebody that has
[46:59] the character of jesus christ
[47:01] because god is love and the bible says
[47:04] of course you know
[47:05] paul said the philippian church so let
[47:06] this mind be in you which was also in
[47:09] christ jesus
[47:10] so that of a sound mind which is a mind
[47:12] that produces the life of christ
[47:14] which is a replication of what jesus did
[47:17] what did jesus
[47:18] will look at the believer today because
[47:20] that's what they're supposed to be
[47:21] emulating
[47:22] because they have the same spirit in
[47:23] them that same
[47:25] sound mind so with the power comes the
[47:28] love and
[47:28] the sound bind but notice here what it
[47:31] says
[47:32] it says god paul is telling timothy now
[47:35] god has not given you the spirit of fear
[47:40] so this fear is a spirit right so the
[47:43] fear
[47:43] that's that that's gripping the world
[47:46] today that's
[47:47] gripping uh well the world you know i
[47:50] focus on our nation of course more than
[47:52] the world but
[47:53] uh but this this fear is gripping the
[47:55] world right
[47:57] uh we we were coming down the road today
[47:59] and
[48:00] and and again don't let this be offense
[48:02] to anybody that does
[48:03] don't mean it that way but we saw a
[48:05] woman walking down the sidewalk there
[48:07] was somebody within
[48:08] 50 yards of that woman she had a mask on
[48:11] outside according to science and edison
[48:14] the most
[48:15] safe place you can be is outside
[48:18] with a mask on with nobody around them
[48:21] and and my wife's asking me what do you
[48:23] think
[48:23] compels somebody to to want to have the
[48:26] mask on when they're in the middle of
[48:28] nowhere basically i mean there's nobody
[48:30] even close to that person
[48:31] the closest people to them are confined
[48:33] in their cars
[48:35] but yet wearing a mask and i i thought
[48:38] well that's just the conformity that the
[48:40] government wants to put upon people
[48:42] it's just that conformity it surprises
[48:45] me really
[48:46] it really what surprises me
[48:50] how easily especially americans are
[48:53] willing to relinquish their
[48:55] basic human rights to a government and a
[48:58] government really that's basically done
[49:00] nothing for them
[49:01] right i mean by and far has done nothing
[49:04] for them for the past probably 100 years
[49:06] right at least 50 years done nothing for
[49:08] them
[49:09] but yet relinquish their rights to that
[49:11] to that uh
[49:12] government that entity because according
[49:15] to the government
[49:16] they know better than the common person
[49:20] you know we're peasants that don't know
[49:22] much they know everything so we should
[49:24] follow and do everything they tell us
[49:26] but whatever that that person
[49:30] falls in line with that's up to that
[49:31] person so
[49:33] uh that's up to them but the fear is the
[49:36] thing that
[49:36] that uh you know i thought about too
[49:39] when it when it come to what the lord
[49:41] gave me yesterday
[49:42] because it's a spirit it's a spirit to
[49:45] recognize that it's a spirit
[49:47] because look friends fear doesn't attack
[49:49] your sight
[49:50] fear doesn't attack your uh your taste
[49:53] fear doesn't attack your touch fear
[49:55] doesn't attack
[49:56] what it does now those can be channels
[49:59] into your spirit
[50:00] those are channels into your
[50:02] subconscious but
[50:04] fear goes down into your subconscious
[50:07] fear goes down into your spirit that's
[50:10] where the
[50:11] this fear deals with is in your spirit
[50:14] because it is a
[50:15] spirit of fear right you you can only
[50:18] look at something
[50:20] and be afraid because of what your
[50:22] imagination
[50:23] is conjuring up people go in a dark room
[50:27] i mean you know why do they make light
[50:29] lights for children
[50:31] because there's there needs to be light
[50:34] when you get in a place of darkness
[50:36] there's a sense of fear
[50:38] people tend to have fear a spirit of
[50:40] fear will come
[50:42] in certain circumstances and instances
[50:45] and when that fear comes you see
[50:47] something but it's your imagination it's
[50:50] conjuring something up
[50:51] right see it it's like the uh
[50:55] it's like the monster in the closet or
[50:58] the monster under the bed when you're a
[51:00] kid
[51:00] see there's no monster on the bed but
[51:02] the kid is scared
[51:03] because it's imagination is a is
[51:06] imagining something that's not there
[51:08] and that's how satan does it satan works
[51:11] on a person's imagination
[51:12] satan works on a person's spirit to
[51:15] bring a spirit of fear on that person
[51:17] because he knows if he can bring fear
[51:20] into your life
[51:21] he'll separate you from faith right
[51:24] you will be separated from faith the
[51:27] moment you fear
[51:28] right because when you fear something
[51:30] you give
[51:31] into it and when you give into it you
[51:34] are its slave
[51:35] right there's no faith there it's like
[51:38] brother branham talked about with cancer
[51:40] when he talked about cancer
[51:42] as soon as the the word a lot of people
[51:44] as soon as that word cancer is mentioned
[51:46] fear comes on a person and they're gone
[51:49] their countenance changes their whole
[51:51] attitude changes
[51:52] and and all of a sudden they're
[51:56] they just might as well give up right
[51:57] there because they're done right because
[51:59] they
[51:59] fear it so greatly he said but and i'm
[52:03] paraphrasing of course
[52:04] brother branham said but you give
[52:05] someone that's not afraid of it
[52:08] and i'll stand in the face of it by
[52:10] faith and believe
[52:12] then i'll find you somebody that can be
[52:14] healed because they still have faith to
[52:16] believe that god is still god
[52:18] that god will still heal them that god's
[52:20] still in the healing business
[52:22] you believe god still heals amen god
[52:25] said friends
[52:26] god never promised us that we would
[52:27] never get sick
[52:29] did he never promise you you'd never get
[52:31] sick he just said i will be your healer
[52:34] am i
[52:34] he said by my stripes you're healed
[52:36] that's right so when we do get sick we
[52:38] know that he's our healer
[52:40] god is there to to provide and to take
[52:43] care of us so why
[52:44] what is there to fear it's a spirit
[52:48] satan works in the demonics satan works
[52:51] in the principalities and powers of the
[52:54] air of things that we can't see in that
[52:56] spirit realm
[52:57] and that's where he sends that spirit of
[53:00] fear see
[53:01] that spirit of fear comes into that same
[53:03] realm because we don't fight against
[53:05] principalities and powers
[53:07] of of the world flesh and we don't fight
[53:10] against flesh and blood
[53:12] but principalities and powers of the air
[53:14] the dark wickedness and dark places
[53:16] things we don't see we fight against
[53:19] that
[53:20] that spirit those spirits friend to
[53:22] understand those
[53:23] spirits are very real yes they are you
[53:26] may not recognize it to the point that
[53:28] what they really are i don't know that
[53:30] any of us do to that exact point
[53:32] but spirits are real right you don't
[53:34] think spirits are real
[53:36] you go back and and read about saul
[53:39] and jonathan going to the witch of endor
[53:42] the witch of endor the demonic
[53:46] evil spirit of the witch of endor and
[53:49] he implores her to call up the spirit of
[53:52] samuel who had gone on
[53:54] to come up to and consult with samuel
[53:58] saul wanted to talk to samuel so bad he
[54:01] went to a witch to bring his spirit up
[54:03] so that he could converse with him
[54:06] you don't think those spiritual real
[54:08] friends there are real that's right
[54:10] they're absolutely real you think it
[54:12] ended with the witch of endor
[54:14] oh absolutely not that same spirit is
[54:17] here today
[54:18] oh yeah satan used hollywood
[54:22] many years ago to begin you to begin to
[54:25] glamorize
[54:26] wickery and glamorize demonic spirits
[54:30] and glamorize bewitching right
[54:33] i just said that word triggered you
[54:34] didn't it
[54:36] you remember the years ago the tv show
[54:39] bewitched
[54:40] oh it glamorized with being a witch
[54:46] made it look like oh this is this is a
[54:48] wonderful thing to be a witch all i have
[54:50] to do is twinkle my nose and i can move
[54:52] all the uh chairs and and
[54:55] and be from one place to the other and
[54:58] and
[54:59] move a mountain all i gotta do is
[55:02] twinkle my nose
[55:04] glamorizing it oh and there's a bunch of
[55:06] them that's come after that
[55:08] you know what i'm talking about right
[55:09] all the shows and movies and things that
[55:12] glamorize demonic spirits
[55:16] that glamorize bewitching and wickery
[55:20] but it's as real today as it has always
[55:22] been right
[55:24] back in saul's day that witch called up
[55:26] a dead person
[55:28] and saw and jonah could stand there and
[55:30] see him and talk to him
[55:32] samuel talked to them and said why have
[55:34] you disturbed my arrest
[55:39] seeing that you're you've been made the
[55:41] enemy of god
[55:42] why have you disturbed me you're the
[55:44] enemy of god
[55:46] right this time tomorrow you and your
[55:48] sons will be with me
[55:51] brother branham said he came up he was
[55:53] still samuel and he was still a prophet
[55:55] yes because he prophesied and told him
[55:58] this time tomorrow you'll be with me
[56:00] praise the lord a witch though
[56:04] think about that a witch working in that
[56:07] spirit
[56:09] working in that spirit realm and that
[56:12] spirit how real it is of fear
[56:16] that satan tries to put upon people that
[56:19] satan will try to put upon you
[56:21] in every form of life to bring fear
[56:24] upon your life but god has not given us
[56:28] the spirit of fear he's given us a
[56:31] spirit
[56:32] of power yes a spirit of love
[56:36] and a spirit of the sound mind
[56:39] praise the lord look at this
[56:42] let's go over to the second uh first
[56:44] kings first kings chapter 22.
[56:52] let's see this this battle against that
[56:55] those spirits
[56:57] now satan uses those spirits
[57:00] but god will orchestrate those spirits
[57:03] as well because those spirits know who
[57:05] they have to answer to
[57:07] they're the spirit of satan but they
[57:10] know
[57:11] that they have to answer to a different
[57:13] authority
[57:15] first kings chapter 22 uh verse 20 the
[57:18] story of micah
[57:20] ahab and jehoshaphat going up to uh
[57:23] take over the land raymond gilead
[57:26] and they're asking all their prophets
[57:28] you see
[57:29] he had has all his prophets there he's
[57:31] got them all lined up
[57:33] he's got them all in in unison
[57:36] they're all saying the same thing
[57:38] they're all saying one thing
[57:40] and it's just like today friend it seems
[57:43] like well if
[57:44] if if all the and every one of them was
[57:47] a liar
[57:49] every one of them such so that
[57:52] jehoshaphat had just a little
[57:54] sparkle of god left in him said don't
[57:55] you just have one more ahem
[57:58] 400 wasn't good enough for you 400 the
[58:02] best prophets
[58:02] school trained i've had the raised up
[58:05] and
[58:06] and taught to be prophets they're not
[58:08] good enough for you i said just
[58:10] don't you just have one more yeah i got
[58:12] one more but i hate him
[58:14] oh don't let the king say so yeah but he
[58:17] always speaks evil against me
[58:19] that's cause you're as big a liar as the
[58:21] 400 prophets you've trained to lie on
[58:23] your behalf
[58:24] you're liar as they are but just one
[58:27] more
[58:28] yeah his name's micah son of him they go
[58:31] go get him and bring him out here and so
[58:33] god shows micah what's going on
[58:36] and he comes out there and he knows that
[58:39] he's only going to say now they go and
[58:40] they try to tell now look
[58:42] you know we'll bring you back in the
[58:43] fellowship micah we'll
[58:45] we'll bring you back into the church and
[58:47] we'll even give you a position
[58:49] said just this one time please just this
[58:52] one time won't you speak what's good
[58:54] about the king
[58:56] and mike has said the some of the best
[58:58] words anybody could ever utter i'll say
[59:00] only what god gives me to say amen i'll
[59:04] only say what god puts on my lips what
[59:06] god tells me to say
[59:08] is what i'll say and god ahab had made
[59:12] himself an
[59:12] enemy to god so god and ahab were on top
[59:16] of speaking terms
[59:17] so when it come to a man who was willing
[59:19] to say what god said
[59:20] and not lie like the rest of them then
[59:24] god had somebody he could work with
[59:26] amen so micah begins to prophesy and he
[59:29] begins to tell what god shows him as
[59:31] as he comes up 20th verse now
[59:35] and the lord said who shall persuade
[59:37] ahab
[59:38] now look at this this is this is the
[59:40] vision this is the
[59:42] the uh the the what god has showed micah
[59:46] that took place because what it took
[59:49] place
[59:51] in god's mind was then manifested on the
[59:54] earth
[59:55] and what god is showing micah is what
[59:57] had happened in heaven
[1:00:00] and as as micah begins to explain it he
[1:00:03] says the lord said
[1:00:06] who shall persuade ahab that he may go
[1:00:08] up and fall at ramos gilead because
[1:00:10] see the prophet's words elijah's words
[1:00:12] had to be fulfilled
[1:00:14] and he'd already said that the dogs
[1:00:16] would eat jezebel and that the dogs
[1:00:18] would lick his blood at the same place
[1:00:19] that
[1:00:20] uh they killed nabal see and so that had
[1:00:23] to happen
[1:00:24] because a prophet said it a prophet
[1:00:26] prophesied it
[1:00:27] so now there's got to be a way to
[1:00:29] manifest that there's got to be a way
[1:00:31] to make that happen to cause that to
[1:00:33] happen
[1:00:34] not make it happen cause it to happen
[1:00:37] so god see so god's calling says who can
[1:00:40] go up
[1:00:41] and and persuade ahab that he'll go to
[1:00:44] ramoff gilead
[1:00:45] because this battle needs to happen so
[1:00:47] he can
[1:00:48] so he can be shot he can be driven
[1:00:51] wounded
[1:00:52] down to the place that they killed
[1:00:54] naboth and the dogs will lick his blood
[1:00:56] there
[1:00:57] right because that was the prophecy all
[1:01:00] these events
[1:01:01] look at look at what god does saints
[1:01:04] god takes a little thing over here and
[1:01:07] and he
[1:01:07] and he makes causes this to happen over
[1:01:10] here and he
[1:01:10] brings all these circumstances together
[1:01:13] just so a prophecy that a prophet gave
[1:01:16] would be fulfilled
[1:01:17] just so that ahab would go to the place
[1:01:20] that he was supposed to go
[1:01:21] to be shot and then the dogs didn't lick
[1:01:24] his blood where he was shot
[1:01:26] did you know that the dogs didn't lick
[1:01:28] his blood where he was
[1:01:29] killed a lot of times you think the dogs
[1:01:32] will lick your blood
[1:01:33] well as soon as he shot the blood the
[1:01:35] dogs would be there that's not what
[1:01:36] happened
[1:01:39] he was shot he was killed and the
[1:01:42] chariot contained ahab's blood
[1:01:45] and the chariot was driven down where
[1:01:48] naboth was
[1:01:49] and when they washed the blood out of
[1:01:51] the chariots the dogs were there to lick
[1:01:53] up the blood just exactly like the
[1:01:55] prophet said
[1:01:56] not the way you may have imagined it was
[1:01:58] going to happen but exactly the way
[1:02:00] god spoke to a prophet for it to happen
[1:02:03] it didn't say ahab was going to be there
[1:02:06] just said the dogs would lick your blood
[1:02:07] and that's what they did
[1:02:09] but god now is causing that to happen
[1:02:13] who will persuade ahab that he may go up
[1:02:15] and fall at ramachelia and one said in
[1:02:17] this manner another set of that manner
[1:02:21] and there came forth a spirit a
[1:02:24] spirit and stood before the lord
[1:02:28] and said i will persuade him and the
[1:02:31] lord said unto this spirit now wherewith
[1:02:35] how are you going to do this and that
[1:02:38] spirit said to the lord
[1:02:40] i will go forth and i will put a lying
[1:02:43] spirit in the mouth of
[1:02:44] all his prophets and he said thou shalt
[1:02:47] persuade him and prevail also
[1:02:49] go forth and do so so who is
[1:02:52] orchestrating
[1:02:53] this demonic spirit you say how you know
[1:02:56] it's demonic because it's a lying spirit
[1:02:58] amen it's a spirit of lies
[1:03:02] which is unbelievably prevalent today
[1:03:05] but the spirit of line that's a demon
[1:03:09] right people don't recognize how much
[1:03:12] that
[1:03:12] lie that those lies that's a demon when
[1:03:16] a person just
[1:03:17] blatantly comes out in lies that's a
[1:03:19] spirit
[1:03:21] that's working in your spirit to cause
[1:03:24] you through your consciousness to lie
[1:03:27] and that's a demonic spirit so this
[1:03:30] demonic spirit has now received
[1:03:32] permission from god
[1:03:33] to go to those prophets and put a lying
[1:03:36] spirit in
[1:03:37] all the mouths of those prophets and
[1:03:39] that's exactly what happened
[1:03:40] the lying spirit came and put a lie in
[1:03:43] all the mouths of those prophets
[1:03:45] a lying spirit understand
[1:03:48] that's where that that works through
[1:03:50] that spirit realm
[1:03:51] that lying that lying spirit it's a
[1:03:54] demonic spirit
[1:03:55] to cause that spirit to do what uh
[1:03:58] what overcomes that person to do that
[1:04:01] prevailing nature of that spirit
[1:04:04] and that prevailing nature of that
[1:04:06] spirit of fear
[1:04:07] is that spirit of the devil that comes
[1:04:10] into a person
[1:04:11] to cause him to lose faith in where
[1:04:13] their core belief
[1:04:14] is right and that's jesus christ
[1:04:17] and his word if he can cause you to fear
[1:04:21] he can cause you to disbelieve the word
[1:04:24] he can separate you from actual truth
[1:04:28] he can separate you from receiving the
[1:04:31] blessings of god
[1:04:33] just by fear coming in your life
[1:04:36] but paul said he hasn't given us the
[1:04:39] spirit of fear
[1:04:40] very much we don't have the spirit of
[1:04:42] fear friend
[1:04:43] amen fears of the devil right
[1:04:46] fears of the devil faith is of god amen
[1:04:50] faith is in existence where faith
[1:04:54] cannot exist but
[1:04:57] understand something satan's not gonna
[1:04:59] quit
[1:05:00] satan doesn't just give up because we
[1:05:03] stand here and proclaim
[1:05:04] the faith in our lives of jesus christ
[1:05:07] god and his word
[1:05:08] he's still going to continually to
[1:05:10] batter you
[1:05:12] with a spirit of fear a spirit of fear
[1:05:17] but god has given us the spirit of power
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] amen you ever know the spirit of power
[1:05:24] so now in you is is not again this isn't
[1:05:27] we're not talking about something
[1:05:29] fleshly
[1:05:30] god hasn't given you big muscles god
[1:05:33] hasn't given you
[1:05:34] strength in your body now one can lead
[1:05:37] to the other
[1:05:38] but we're not talking about mr universe
[1:05:41] we're talking about strength and
[1:05:42] strength in your spirit
[1:05:45] god has given you power in your spirit
[1:05:47] and it's not just
[1:05:49] power of strength listen now
[1:05:52] this power comes to an ability
[1:05:58] an ability a person could be the
[1:06:01] strongest person physically in the world
[1:06:03] but not have the ability to do something
[1:06:06] somebody some guy may have so many
[1:06:08] muscles he does not have the ability to
[1:06:11] tie his shoelaces right because he can't
[1:06:14] bend over
[1:06:15] too much too many muscles he may not
[1:06:19] have the ability
[1:06:20] this power that he's talking about this
[1:06:22] scriptural spiritual power is an ability
[1:06:26] god is giving you the spirit to be able
[1:06:29] to what have faith amen
[1:06:32] have faith and belief it is an authority
[1:06:36] this power is an authority it gives you
[1:06:38] the ability and the authority
[1:06:41] to do it we talked about last week a
[1:06:43] little bit on the authority
[1:06:45] to be able to do something not just the
[1:06:47] power
[1:06:48] but be able to know that when you speak
[1:06:50] all of heaven is backing you up amen
[1:06:54] when you enforce something the holy
[1:06:56] spirit is there if you're born again
[1:06:58] to enforce that to to cause that to
[1:07:01] bring that to pass
[1:07:03] amen amen but it's the ability it's the
[1:07:07] authority to do it
[1:07:08] amen it's virtue
[1:07:12] it's miracles this power
[1:07:16] is an influence but it's also the one
[1:07:19] thing i want to get across
[1:07:21] now maybe more than anything it gives
[1:07:23] you the right
[1:07:26] you say power the right if you look
[1:07:29] through the scripture you'll see
[1:07:31] as i studied this i saw how this power
[1:07:34] gives you the right to do something
[1:07:38] it's like last week when we talked about
[1:07:40] us having the
[1:07:42] power to enforce something that satan
[1:07:45] has tried to take from us or satan has
[1:07:47] taken
[1:07:48] god has given you the authority god has
[1:07:50] entrusted you
[1:07:51] with the power the ability and the right
[1:07:55] to do it
[1:07:56] right you have the legal right to do it
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] amen this spirit of power comes with the
[1:08:03] authority
[1:08:03] the ability uh its miracles its healings
[1:08:07] its influence but it's the right to do
[1:08:10] it
[1:08:11] in god's eyes you have the right to do
[1:08:14] it
[1:08:15] satan does not have the right to do it
[1:08:17] right
[1:08:18] if satan is on your ground he does not
[1:08:20] have the right
[1:08:22] now if you allow him to do it and we can
[1:08:25] go back to
[1:08:26] uh even like we talked about last week
[1:08:28] with property
[1:08:29] with tangible property you can own a
[1:08:32] house you can have a yard
[1:08:33] somebody comes in your yard you can have
[1:08:35] no trespassing somebody comes in your
[1:08:36] yard you can say you have to leave or
[1:08:38] i'll call the police
[1:08:40] you have the right to do that because he
[1:08:43] has
[1:08:43] no right to be there because it's not
[1:08:45] his property
[1:08:48] it's not public property it's your
[1:08:50] property
[1:08:51] you have a right to that not him so if
[1:08:54] that power is given
[1:08:55] it's given you the right to do it not
[1:08:58] only the ability
[1:09:00] not only the authority not only the
[1:09:02] virtue or the influence but it gives you
[1:09:04] the right to do it
[1:09:06] right amen so in the mind of god i have
[1:09:09] the right to do
[1:09:10] what i'm doing amen i have a right to
[1:09:14] stand upon
[1:09:15] god's word that says by my stripes you
[1:09:17] are healed
[1:09:18] amen i have a right to stand on that
[1:09:21] word
[1:09:22] it seems like medicine has taken control
[1:09:25] of that
[1:09:25] and i'm not preaching against medicine
[1:09:27] right uh medicine has its place and it's
[1:09:30] fine in his position brother branham
[1:09:31] went to a doctor often
[1:09:33] talked about it on tape many many times
[1:09:35] had a very good friend his doctor called
[1:09:36] dr adair
[1:09:38] so i'm not preaching against that but i
[1:09:41] do
[1:09:41] preach against it when it comes to
[1:09:42] trying to separate you from what god is
[1:09:44] trying to give you
[1:09:46] and that's faith yes that's faith in
[1:09:49] god's unfailing word that he promised
[1:09:51] you he would do it
[1:09:53] that's our right to claim it
[1:09:56] we have the ability we have the
[1:09:59] authority the right to do it let's go to
[1:10:01] a very familiar scripture mark 16.
[1:10:08] saint mark chapter 16.
[1:10:16] because as wonderful as this sounds to
[1:10:20] have this
[1:10:20] right to have this ability and authority
[1:10:25] there's also responsibility that comes
[1:10:27] with this power
[1:10:29] remember power without character is
[1:10:31] satanic
[1:10:32] right so the character of it has got to
[1:10:35] be present
[1:10:36] to be able to utilize the power in the
[1:10:39] proper way
[1:10:40] to be able to have the right to do it
[1:10:42] you also have to
[1:10:44] carry with it the spirit of love
[1:10:47] compassion and the spirit of a sound
[1:10:50] mind
[1:10:50] the mind of god we'll just just couple
[1:10:54] that with the mind of god the same
[1:10:55] the same as god let this mind be in you
[1:10:57] which is also in christ jesus the sound
[1:10:59] mind
[1:11:00] love which is god so being able to have
[1:11:02] the characteristic to follow up
[1:11:05] with what the power has enabled you to
[1:11:07] do
[1:11:08] is as crucial as actually obtaining it
[1:11:10] and having it itself
[1:11:13] mark 16 verse 14
[1:11:17] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[1:11:20] they sat at meat and upbraided them
[1:11:22] with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:11:24] heart god help us
[1:11:27] god help me amen amen
[1:11:32] the miracles the the right
[1:11:36] the ability authority
[1:11:39] the right that god has given us today
[1:11:42] and
[1:11:42] so many times we we let it slip
[1:11:46] so many times we don't utilize it we let
[1:11:49] fear take over our lives
[1:11:51] we let fear rule us we let fear take
[1:11:54] over
[1:11:55] of how we live and what we do
[1:12:02] so god help me because he had braided
[1:12:05] them for their unbelief and hardness of
[1:12:07] heart because they believed not them
[1:12:09] which had seen him after he was risen
[1:12:12] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:12:15] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:12:17] creature
[1:12:18] power that's what paul power
[1:12:21] manifestation of the spirit
[1:12:23] you know what he said didn't come in
[1:12:24] word form but empower
[1:12:27] amen jesus is a word he's power
[1:12:30] he's spirit he's life amen
[1:12:35] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:12:37] be saved
[1:12:39] he that believeth not shall be damned
[1:12:42] and these signs shall follow who
[1:12:45] them that believe
[1:12:48] so this is for the believer so if you're
[1:12:50] a believer
[1:12:51] follow along with me if you're not i
[1:12:54] pray you become one before you leave
[1:12:55] today
[1:12:56] amen or before you we quit this service
[1:12:58] and if you're watching
[1:13:00] all these signs shall follow them that
[1:13:02] believe
[1:13:03] in my name shall they cast out devils
[1:13:07] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:13:09] shall take up serpents
[1:13:11] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:13:13] shall not hurt them
[1:13:15] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:17] they shall recover
[1:13:19] so look at this for just a moment
[1:13:21] brother rogers
[1:13:22] very popular i guess and we know as i've
[1:13:25] known for years
[1:13:26] for his mark 16 prayer line where he
[1:13:28] says lay hands on the sick and we lay
[1:13:30] hands
[1:13:31] have a prayer line come through and all
[1:13:32] we do is lay hands on because that's
[1:13:34] what the bible said
[1:13:35] the prayer of faith saved shall save the
[1:13:38] sick as well
[1:13:39] but this says lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:41] they shall recover
[1:13:42] so what is this a little snippet you got
[1:13:46] red letter bible i do too this is jesus
[1:13:48] speaking
[1:13:50] he said these signs follow the believer
[1:13:53] these signs
[1:13:54] so these are the things that that my
[1:13:57] followers the believer is going to
[1:14:00] manifest
[1:14:00] this is what is going the fruits they're
[1:14:03] going to bear
[1:14:05] in my name shall they cast out devils
[1:14:10] they shall speak with new tongues
[1:14:13] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:14:16] drink
[1:14:16] inly deadly any deadly thing it shall
[1:14:19] not hurt them
[1:14:21] but now what does he say he said we're
[1:14:24] cast out
[1:14:25] devils and if they lay hands on the sick
[1:14:30] so that's not so you understand it's
[1:14:32] saying they're not it's
[1:14:34] it's not propagating there will never be
[1:14:36] sickness
[1:14:37] it's just saying when they get sick
[1:14:39] we'll lay hands on them and they'll be
[1:14:40] well
[1:14:43] that's what his promise is not that they
[1:14:46] wouldn't get sick
[1:14:47] but that will lay hands on the sick
[1:14:50] hard hard to lay hands on sick when
[1:14:52] they're not here but we'll lay hands on
[1:14:53] them virtually can we do that they want
[1:14:55] to do everything virtually today so we
[1:14:57] virtually lay hands on everybody
[1:14:59] yeah not the same thing friends sorry it
[1:15:02] is not the same thing
[1:15:03] but it says lay hands on the sick and
[1:15:06] they shall recover
[1:15:07] now this sounds like quite a powerful
[1:15:10] section of scripture
[1:15:11] amen will take up serpents not hurt you
[1:15:15] well paul manifested that later in the
[1:15:17] scripture
[1:15:18] i told you that in my in in my feeling
[1:15:22] in my conversation with the lord and
[1:15:25] what's in my spirit
[1:15:26] is when we're in the work of the lord
[1:15:29] here
[1:15:30] there's nothing to fear right paul was
[1:15:33] in the work of the lord and the snake
[1:15:35] come and grabbed him by the hand
[1:15:37] he was in the work of the lord he was he
[1:15:39] was preaching to heathens
[1:15:40] right and it was a very venomous snake
[1:15:43] he shook it off in the fire and he just
[1:15:45] kept on preaching
[1:15:46] and they stood back because they thought
[1:15:48] it was the devil
[1:15:50] but then when he but then they said oh
[1:15:52] wait he's about to die now that's one
[1:15:54] that's the most venomous snake
[1:15:55] he'll just he'll be dead in a few
[1:15:56] minutes and he stands there and preaches
[1:15:58] and preaches and preaching and they
[1:15:59] looked at him
[1:16:00] and all of a sudden they become amazed
[1:16:01] and now they think he's a god
[1:16:04] so who do you think this is my
[1:16:07] assessment of it
[1:16:08] who do you think caused that poisonous
[1:16:11] snake
[1:16:12] to come and bite paul who caused that to
[1:16:14] happen
[1:16:16] now satan may have been instructing the
[1:16:19] poisonous snake i don't know
[1:16:20] does it say but i guarantee you god
[1:16:22] orchestrated that whole thing
[1:16:25] because at first those heathens weren't
[1:16:26] listening to paul
[1:16:28] but as soon as he shook that snake off
[1:16:30] and he didn't die
[1:16:31] they thought he was a god and as soon as
[1:16:33] they thought he was a god they began to
[1:16:35] hear what he had to preach
[1:16:37] and when they listened to what he had to
[1:16:39] preach it changed their lives
[1:16:41] amen this is a reason for everything
[1:16:44] friend
[1:16:45] there's no reason to fear if you were
[1:16:48] standing there
[1:16:49] or or or doing the work of the lord and
[1:16:51] something come and struck you or
[1:16:53] a snake or something like that fear a
[1:16:57] lot of times the first thing comes to a
[1:16:58] person's mind
[1:16:59] they get afraid oh it's a rattlesnake oh
[1:17:03] don't fear amen don't fear
[1:17:07] there could be a very good reason and if
[1:17:10] you're a believer i believe there is a
[1:17:12] very good purpose for why god is
[1:17:13] allowing this to happen
[1:17:15] right paul just shook it off and kept
[1:17:17] going all of a sudden they thought the
[1:17:18] man was a god and they started to listen
[1:17:20] to what he had to say
[1:17:22] amen see god's in control of this friend
[1:17:25] yes but that power look what that power
[1:17:28] does
[1:17:29] that power with authority ability you
[1:17:32] have a right to that power
[1:17:34] but that power comes with responsibility
[1:17:38] because mark 16 talks about this
[1:17:41] and it says the signs shall fall them to
[1:17:43] believe they shall cast
[1:17:44] out devils who is that going to help
[1:17:48] those that are demon-possessed right
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:52] you stand here and cast out a devil it's
[1:17:54] not helping you
[1:17:55] in fact there's times that we've had
[1:17:58] service and there's been devils present
[1:18:00] and prayed for people and cast devils
[1:18:02] out
[1:18:02] that those devils followed me home right
[1:18:06] and i see them sometimes at night
[1:18:09] because they follow you home it's not
[1:18:11] benefiting us
[1:18:13] when you speak to those demons and you
[1:18:15] cast those devils out
[1:18:17] but it's benefiting the person that's
[1:18:18] being freed from that devil
[1:18:20] right that power gives responsibility
[1:18:24] brother brother dennis prayed it at the
[1:18:27] opening prayer of this service
[1:18:29] we're living our life for others we're
[1:18:31] staring heaven in the face
[1:18:32] that's what this power this spirit of
[1:18:35] power is given to us for
[1:18:36] so that we can go forth helping other
[1:18:39] people
[1:18:40] casting out devils speaking with new
[1:18:44] tongues
[1:18:44] take up serpents drink deadly things lay
[1:18:47] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:18:50] this is to the benefit of other people
[1:18:53] it's not something that
[1:18:54] i abhor to say oh this is i am this
[1:18:57] great person
[1:18:58] like a lot of times you see people
[1:19:00] especially
[1:19:02] well dares i say unbelievers that have a
[1:19:06] gift
[1:19:07] they they proclaim there's something
[1:19:09] they proclaim there's somebody
[1:19:10] they'll tell you and try to convince you
[1:19:12] that they got this great gift
[1:19:14] and they're this great mighty prophet or
[1:19:15] they're this great mighty
[1:19:17] uh they could speak or gifts of healing
[1:19:20] or whatever
[1:19:22] friend if you've got a gift like that
[1:19:24] all it's going to do is if it's a gift
[1:19:26] of god and it's put in the right vessel
[1:19:28] all it's going to do is cause you to be
[1:19:29] more humble
[1:19:31] it's not going to cause you to be puffed
[1:19:32] up it's not going to cause you to
[1:19:34] to project yourself as some great healer
[1:19:37] or some great prophet or something
[1:19:39] right it's going to cause you to be
[1:19:41] humble it's going to bring you down to
[1:19:43] where
[1:19:44] you are a servant to other people
[1:19:46] because that's what this power is for
[1:19:48] that's what this authority this right
[1:19:50] that god has given you
[1:19:51] is to be able to go forth and to help
[1:19:53] other people amen
[1:19:55] and when you're helping other people you
[1:19:56] give them the gospel
[1:19:58] you help them get the gospel so that
[1:20:00] they can understand and receive what
[1:20:02] you've got
[1:20:03] am i healing is temporal friend
[1:20:06] you could be healed of one thing today
[1:20:08] and die tomorrow
[1:20:09] right but eternal life is eternal life
[1:20:13] amen how many people
[1:20:16] met their eternal destination this week
[1:20:19] without knowing jesus christ
[1:20:21] right sometimes when that hits my heart
[1:20:24] i wake up on a sunday morning and
[1:20:26] that hits my heart i think god help me
[1:20:29] how many people there was a
[1:20:33] uh and i'll just say it there there was
[1:20:35] a because it keeps coming to my mind
[1:20:36] there was a a a rock and roll legend
[1:20:40] that i used to listen to when i was a
[1:20:42] kid died this week
[1:20:44] right and all my thoughts could thank
[1:20:46] god did he know you
[1:20:47] yes right did he know him before he took
[1:20:50] that last breath because that's all that
[1:20:52] matters to him right now
[1:20:54] it don't matter how many times he was uh
[1:20:57] money he had or uh concerts he gave or
[1:21:00] how good a guitar he played or anything
[1:21:02] else all that mattered at that moment in
[1:21:04] time
[1:21:04] was did he know jesus christ right yes
[1:21:07] that's right
[1:21:07] and i think how many people died this
[1:21:10] week
[1:21:10] in this world without knowing jesus
[1:21:14] i dares to say it was a lot right a lot
[1:21:18] this power gives us responsibility
[1:21:22] this responsibility is to try to help
[1:21:25] other people
[1:21:26] i know we're gleaning i know we're in a
[1:21:27] gleaning age i know this country
[1:21:30] is burnt over uh i mean even
[1:21:33] i even had a question from her brother
[1:21:35] this week do you think the prophecy or
[1:21:37] the
[1:21:38] vision that brother branham had about
[1:21:39] border border coast to coast was
[1:21:41] metaphoric
[1:21:43] and i thought well no because brother
[1:21:45] graham talked about the volcanics
[1:21:47] exploding too
[1:21:48] and all so i believe it's literal but
[1:21:50] it's become so burned over
[1:21:53] that you feel like sometimes maybe that
[1:21:55] vision was metaphoric it's burned over
[1:21:57] border border coast to coast god help us
[1:22:00] if there's one seed though
[1:22:02] help us to find it lord amen just one
[1:22:05] whoever it is wherever if we can help
[1:22:07] somebody even make it there with without
[1:22:10] being in the city or something
[1:22:11] if i could do something to help somebody
[1:22:13] if i can just do
[1:22:14] something to help this miserable life on
[1:22:17] this earth be a little bit better for
[1:22:19] them
[1:22:19] right if this is all they're gonna have
[1:22:21] that's right help me to do it
[1:22:24] if this is all they're going to have and
[1:22:26] i can help make what they're doing here
[1:22:28] better help me to do it
[1:22:32] because it comes with responsibility
[1:22:36] this power is granted to the believer in
[1:22:38] order to help others
[1:22:40] yes but it comes with authority
[1:22:44] it comes with uh uh
[1:22:47] ability and the right you have the right
[1:22:51] to do it
[1:22:52] it doesn't say it says the believer has
[1:22:54] a right to cast out devils
[1:22:56] it has the believer has a right to lay
[1:22:59] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:23:01] it does not say that the person that's
[1:23:04] receiving
[1:23:05] healing is a believer it says the person
[1:23:08] that's laying hands on them
[1:23:10] has a right to lay hands on them and
[1:23:12] cast that devil out
[1:23:13] right now it could be a believer
[1:23:17] and a lot of times that's probably true
[1:23:19] because a lot of times this is
[1:23:20] manifested in churches
[1:23:22] but you can find somebody out here in
[1:23:24] the world
[1:23:27] i came i came to the tent meeting that
[1:23:30] brother roger
[1:23:31] monday night i hadn't felt up to coming
[1:23:34] the rest of the time but
[1:23:35] monday night i came before i had the
[1:23:36] dentist tuesday and
[1:23:38] he was talking about the pool of
[1:23:39] bethesda and jesus coming and
[1:23:42] stepping over and around the pool and
[1:23:44] stepping all around all the people that
[1:23:46] were sitting there and been sitting
[1:23:47] there
[1:23:48] saying maybe even longer than the man
[1:23:49] had been there for 38 years
[1:23:51] maybe some been there longer maybe some
[1:23:53] in worse condition than this guy
[1:23:55] but he goes to one man he goes to one
[1:23:58] person
[1:24:00] to find now do we know what that person
[1:24:04] did afterwards
[1:24:06] now jesus when the woman come with the
[1:24:08] uh with the
[1:24:10] calling the act of adultery jesus said
[1:24:11] go sin no more
[1:24:13] and i don't believe she did
[1:24:16] but we don't know because it doesn't say
[1:24:20] i don't believe she did i believe when
[1:24:23] god does something i think he does it
[1:24:24] permanent
[1:24:26] but you notice the bible doesn't say it
[1:24:28] says
[1:24:29] that the believer lay hands on the sick
[1:24:31] and they shall recover
[1:24:33] that's all it says it says that uh
[1:24:37] that we should uh take up serpents drink
[1:24:40] deadly things
[1:24:42] you know brother green often use that
[1:24:43] drink deadly things for people who
[1:24:45] considered or not considered taking
[1:24:47] chemo even right
[1:24:48] now i would go with him there uh
[1:24:52] that probably a good example to
[1:24:53] understand you know if it's something
[1:24:56] that
[1:24:56] medical sciences deemed that's going to
[1:24:59] be a help to you
[1:25:00] uh then take it because it won't harm
[1:25:02] you because the bible says you can drink
[1:25:04] that deadly thing and it won't hurt you
[1:25:06] right if you're a believer amen i
[1:25:09] believe that
[1:25:10] so i stand upon that i trust god for
[1:25:13] that right
[1:25:14] amen let's go to acts chapter one
[1:25:23] and all the glamorization of all this
[1:25:26] power that you see
[1:25:29] utilized by demonic spirits
[1:25:33] and you see hollywood glamorize that and
[1:25:36] make it look like oh this is
[1:25:38] this is such a wonderful thing you know
[1:25:39] if you were just a witch you could
[1:25:41] twickle your nose and you could be able
[1:25:42] to move mountains
[1:25:44] if you're a son or daughter of god you
[1:25:46] just have faith you move the mountain
[1:25:48] but you don't move but but see the big
[1:25:51] difference here
[1:25:52] is the power without character and the
[1:25:54] power went character
[1:25:55] the power in the demonic realm is for
[1:25:58] their own self-interest
[1:25:59] right it's for their own purpose the
[1:26:01] power with character is to help other
[1:26:03] people
[1:26:04] is to try to get other people to jesus
[1:26:06] christ
[1:26:07] is to try to do what the will of the
[1:26:09] lord is to be done
[1:26:11] not my will satanic powers
[1:26:14] satanic wishes my power my wishes
[1:26:17] my way jesus says his way is
[1:26:23] our our way is his way i'm a prisoner to
[1:26:26] him
[1:26:28] i'm here to do his will this power's
[1:26:31] instilled in me this
[1:26:32] right god's given me is for his purpose
[1:26:36] for his will whatever he wants to be
[1:26:38] done
[1:26:40] it comes now acts chapter 1 verse 6.
[1:26:43] when they therefore will come together
[1:26:45] they asked of him saying
[1:26:46] lord will doubt this time restore again
[1:26:49] the kingdom to israel
[1:26:50] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:26:52] to know the times
[1:26:54] or the seasons which the father has put
[1:26:56] in his own power
[1:26:59] but ye shall receive power
[1:27:03] after that the holy ghost is come upon
[1:27:06] you
[1:27:06] amen and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[1:27:09] both in jerusalem and in all judea and
[1:27:12] in samaria and unto the other most parts
[1:27:14] of the earth
[1:27:15] now the other most parts of the earth is
[1:27:17] us today i believe
[1:27:18] it wasn't them for that time because
[1:27:20] they couldn't go to the other
[1:27:21] parts of europe right in that day they
[1:27:23] didn't even know there was an utter most
[1:27:25] parts of the earth right
[1:27:26] i mean if they're standing there
[1:27:27] listening to jesus they utter most parts
[1:27:29] of the earth
[1:27:30] maybe they're thinking their name the
[1:27:31] end of their neighborhood or them
[1:27:33] uh or or where the earth dropped off
[1:27:35] because it was flat or
[1:27:36] whatever they were thinking they didn't
[1:27:38] know what the other most parts of the
[1:27:39] earth were because they'd never been
[1:27:40] there
[1:27:40] right that nobody been in this part of
[1:27:43] the country this world
[1:27:44] part of the world before they didn't
[1:27:46] know this even existed
[1:27:48] so that other part of most parts of the
[1:27:50] world is us today
[1:27:51] we have the ability friend there's not a
[1:27:53] speck of grain of sand or dirt on this
[1:27:56] planet on this rock
[1:27:57] hanging out in space that we can't go to
[1:28:00] right
[1:28:00] and it's something i wouldn't want to go
[1:28:02] to but there's there's none i couldn't
[1:28:04] go to
[1:28:05] you can fly there you can drive there
[1:28:08] you can ride a horse there or
[1:28:09] or something you can get there walk to
[1:28:12] almost
[1:28:13] every single spot on the planet why
[1:28:15] shall i say every single spot on the
[1:28:16] planet you could
[1:28:18] you could go there people climbed to the
[1:28:19] highest part of
[1:28:21] the earth on mount everest uh i don't i
[1:28:24] don't know how
[1:28:25] deep the ocean is because i don't know
[1:28:27] if anybody ever knows for sure exactly
[1:28:28] the deepest part of the ocean but
[1:28:30] they've been awful deep down there too
[1:28:32] they've been east and west north and
[1:28:34] south the other most parts
[1:28:36] but he said you shall receive power when
[1:28:40] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:28:43] right now this power notice the power
[1:28:46] that comes
[1:28:48] is when the holy ghost comes upon you
[1:28:52] now that now that that power comes with
[1:28:55] the anointing
[1:28:57] because remember when he said here let
[1:28:59] me read it back here you don't have to
[1:29:00] turn there but in timothy again the way
[1:29:02] paul said it god has not given
[1:29:05] us the spirit of fear but of power god
[1:29:09] has
[1:29:09] given us the spirit of power
[1:29:13] given is furnished or endued with
[1:29:17] or shall i say in this case with the
[1:29:19] holy ghost anointed
[1:29:22] he is given or anointed with the holy
[1:29:24] ghost with the holy ghost comes that
[1:29:26] power
[1:29:27] when he talks about the holy spirit and
[1:29:29] the spirits
[1:29:31] those spirits come with an anointing
[1:29:34] because it's something that comes on you
[1:29:37] in an immersion
[1:29:38] which is a baptism an anointing is the
[1:29:41] baptized
[1:29:41] when you're anointing somebody you're
[1:29:44] immersing them
[1:29:45] you're feeling you're causing them to be
[1:29:48] fully engulfed in whatever it is just
[1:29:51] like uh
[1:29:52] pouring the anointing oil aaron did down
[1:29:54] uh
[1:29:55] down to run down uh uh aaron's beard
[1:29:59] down to the hem of his garment
[1:30:02] that anointing oil it anointed him
[1:30:05] from the top of his head the soles of
[1:30:07] his feet it covered him and engulfed him
[1:30:10] well that given is endued it's given
[1:30:12] it's
[1:30:13] it's anointed and in the place of the
[1:30:16] holy spirit or a
[1:30:17] spirit it's an anointing that comes
[1:30:21] this spirit becomes an anoints it's not
[1:30:24] uh this is not that indwelling
[1:30:29] it because that indwelling comes the
[1:30:32] anointing comes to bring
[1:30:34] power the indwelling comes to bring
[1:30:36] character
[1:30:38] you understand when the holy spirit
[1:30:41] comes
[1:30:42] on people they have the power
[1:30:45] to operate gifts to
[1:30:48] live a certain way or be a certain way
[1:30:51] sometimes it's only in church
[1:30:53] sometimes people have enough god to get
[1:30:55] them until
[1:30:56] uh they get to work and the first dirty
[1:31:00] jokes told and
[1:31:01] you know there they go right no or they
[1:31:04] have just enough anointing to
[1:31:06] take them to church for six or eight
[1:31:08] months and then all of a sudden a little
[1:31:09] thing comes and they're gone
[1:31:11] six or eight years and you know a little
[1:31:13] trial comes and then they're gone
[1:31:15] that's just an anointing but the the
[1:31:18] character comes
[1:31:19] when the when the person of jesus christ
[1:31:22] through the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:31:24] comes and lives and takes permanent
[1:31:26] residence of your soul
[1:31:28] that changes your character now the
[1:31:31] power with character
[1:31:33] is jesus christ the power without the
[1:31:36] character is satanic
[1:31:37] which means people have that power but
[1:31:40] don't have the character
[1:31:41] right but jesus said
[1:31:44] that that power will come on you when
[1:31:47] you receive the holy ghost
[1:31:49] when the holy spirit comes upon you then
[1:31:52] the power comes with it
[1:31:54] so if you've been anointed if you've
[1:31:56] been filled if you've been
[1:31:58] born again by the holy spirit you have
[1:32:00] this power
[1:32:01] right it's innate in you it becomes a
[1:32:04] part of you
[1:32:05] this power does this power is granted
[1:32:09] so that we can have something that leads
[1:32:12] us
[1:32:12] into doing the will of the lord but it
[1:32:14] comes by the holy spirit
[1:32:17] now let's go over to another scripture
[1:32:19] first corinthians
[1:32:29] mama time's gotten away first
[1:32:30] corinthians chapter 2 verse 2.

[1:33:22] spoken

[1:33:28] holy spirit
[1:33:30] jesus christ and that holy ghost coming
[1:33:32] and anointing
[1:33:34] and changing you changing lives making
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:38] power come not just into one human not
[1:33:41] just to one man

[1:34:29] anointing that
[1:34:30] comes with the character of jesus christ

[1:34:52] god is able he's got if we could just if
[1:34:55] this spiritual mind can open today to
[1:34:57] see the
[1:34:58] angels of god and camped around about
[1:35:00] everyone that fears him
[1:35:03] would say what is their fear she don't
[1:35:06] mean so much
[1:35:07] we look at the tangible today or we've
[1:35:10] got to see it
[1:35:11] or we've got to feel it or i've gotta
[1:35:13] i've gotta be able to touch it or
[1:35:16] something or
[1:35:18] that's not faith anything that the
[1:35:21] senses declare
[1:35:22] is not faith right right anything that
[1:35:25] see tastes phil smeller here declares is
[1:35:27] not faith
[1:35:29] we don't rely on the wisdom of man right
[1:35:31] we rely on the faith of god
[1:35:34] god is what changes it and makes it real
[1:35:37] for us
[1:35:39] amen amen spirit of power he's given us
[1:35:41] the spirit of love
[1:35:45] that love is agape god's love he's given
[1:35:49] us the spirit of god's love
[1:35:50] that spirit of love is it's a spirit
[1:35:54] just like we're talking about the spirit
[1:35:56] realm that's that's why that warfare is
[1:35:58] going in the spirit realm
[1:36:00] amen that spirit realm demonic spirits
[1:36:03] the spirits of god
[1:36:04] still at war continually at war
[1:36:10] but god's given you the spirit of love
[1:36:13] amen the spirit of
[1:36:14] god's love now god's love
[1:36:17] i've told you many times to me and what
[1:36:20] god's revealed to me god's love is
[1:36:22] unconditional
[1:36:24] god's love perfect love comes without
[1:36:27] conditions
[1:36:28] you just love you don't love because
[1:36:32] you just love love exists because god
[1:36:35] exists
[1:36:37] and as long as god exists there'll be
[1:36:39] love
[1:36:40] right because he is love amen and if god
[1:36:43] is in you
[1:36:43] you are love amen because god's love
[1:36:46] exists in you
[1:36:47] right and it don't just exist it
[1:36:50] manifests itself
[1:36:52] god manifests that love through you not
[1:36:54] to those
[1:36:55] just have been good to you or spoke good
[1:36:57] things about you or
[1:36:58] done things for you giving you money or
[1:37:01] food or something
[1:37:02] no it's to those who haven't
[1:37:06] those who maybe have spoke bad against
[1:37:08] you
[1:37:09] somebody who maybe had drug you through
[1:37:11] the mud
[1:37:12] yondering back maybe they've
[1:37:16] criticized you maybe they've put you
[1:37:19] down
[1:37:20] maybe they physically assaulted you
[1:37:24] but the god in you loves that person
[1:37:27] unconditionally the love of man says
[1:37:32] one hand washes the other no no the love
[1:37:34] of god says i'll wash them period
[1:37:37] amen the love of god says you pat me on
[1:37:39] the back i'll pat you on the back
[1:37:40] the love of god says i'm gonna pat you
[1:37:42] on the back with you hit me in the face
[1:37:44] amen amen
[1:37:48] you don't hear very many turning the
[1:37:50] cheap messages anymore but it's still
[1:37:52] the bible
[1:37:52] right that's right isn't that what jesus
[1:37:55] said
[1:37:56] if they strike you on one cheek give him
[1:37:57] the other right
[1:37:59] you don't hear him any of that but
[1:38:01] that's exactly what it says
[1:38:03] and you know the devil takes advantage
[1:38:04] of that too right you know the devil
[1:38:06] takes advantage of christians that way
[1:38:08] because they know a true christian is
[1:38:10] going to be like that
[1:38:12] amen and they take advantage of them but
[1:38:16] you know what happens
[1:38:17] in the spirit realm god more than makes
[1:38:20] up for anything the devil can do against
[1:38:22] you right
[1:38:23] god way makes up more 10 million times
[1:38:27] more than what disabled
[1:38:28] whatever the devil can take from you god
[1:38:30] will give you tenfold
[1:38:33] and plus amen
[1:38:36] so we don't worry about what satan can
[1:38:38] do to us
[1:38:39] amen we worry what god can do to us
[1:38:42] god has given us a love a love and you
[1:38:46] know
[1:38:46] well let's just read this first john
[1:38:49] chapter four
[1:38:51] first john now not saint john first john
[1:38:53] chapter four and we'll close here in
[1:38:54] just a minute
[1:38:55] first john chapter four verse 17.
[1:39:02] first john 4 17 herein is our love
[1:39:05] made perfect that we may have boldness
[1:39:08] in the day of judgment because as he
[1:39:12] is so are we in this world
[1:39:15] there is no fear in love praise the lord
[1:39:19] there is no fear in love but
[1:39:23] perfect love casteth out
[1:39:26] fear amen because
[1:39:29] fear hath torment he that feareth
[1:39:33] is not made perfect in love we love him
[1:39:36] because he first loved us
[1:39:40] perfect love cast out fear
[1:39:43] now this love john talks a lot about
[1:39:47] love
[1:39:47] but when he comes to the fourth chapter
[1:39:49] he introduces a perfect love
[1:39:52] not just love but a perfect love
[1:39:56] which is unfaint which is unconditional
[1:39:59] again unconditional and it's a love
[1:40:02] that's manifested to others
[1:40:04] it's a love that's given it's a love
[1:40:06] that's shown it's a love that's produced
[1:40:10] and that love casts out the fear there
[1:40:13] is no fear when you have perfect love
[1:40:16] because everything about you is is god
[1:40:20] and if everything about you is god then
[1:40:22] god does is god afraid
[1:40:25] god's not afraid well if god's not
[1:40:28] afraid then
[1:40:30] what's satan doing messing with you
[1:40:32] because he knows he can still
[1:40:34] try to get to your mind your body your
[1:40:36] spirit
[1:40:37] and try to get you to disbelief to try
[1:40:39] to get you gripped in fear
[1:40:42] that's what satan's doing with this
[1:40:43] coping mess he's trying to grip
[1:40:45] the world with fear now i'm not saying
[1:40:48] there's not a reason for concern
[1:40:51] right i'm not saying that it's 200 000
[1:40:54] people dead in the united states from
[1:40:56] a million worldwide i think or something
[1:40:57] like that i lose attractive figures but
[1:41:00] it's something to that effect
[1:41:02] but it but it's not to be something that
[1:41:05] you fear
[1:41:06] it's not to be feared friend if if
[1:41:10] perfect love is in your life that
[1:41:12] perfect
[1:41:13] love will cast out that fear amen you
[1:41:15] won't have
[1:41:16] fear if you know and trust believe god
[1:41:19] is going to be there to take care of you
[1:41:21] to watch over you we have a right to it
[1:41:23] right that's the power that god's given
[1:41:25] us this perfect love cast out the fear
[1:41:28] so where the perfect love of god is
[1:41:29] there is no fear amen amen
[1:41:32] you don't fear you don't have fear no
[1:41:34] matter
[1:41:35] what's running around the world today
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:38] you don't fear
[1:41:41] god has given us and i'm going to leave
[1:41:43] that there god has given us the spirit
[1:41:45] of a sound mind
[1:41:48] a sound mind we've talked about the
[1:41:52] sound mindset
[1:41:52] i've got one more scripture i want to
[1:41:54] read a sound mind is being
[1:41:57] a a mind of moderation or self-control
[1:42:00] right a mind of god's mind a sane
[1:42:04] sane if you will sanity
[1:42:07] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:42:09] in christ jesus
[1:42:10] now this does not say and this does not
[1:42:14] mean
[1:42:15] that a person that might be uh
[1:42:19] mentally disabled in some way is not
[1:42:21] seen
[1:42:23] you understand what i'm saying brother
[1:42:25] branham said you can be you could be
[1:42:27] totally insane as he put it and still
[1:42:29] have the holy ghost
[1:42:31] still have the holy ghost of a sound
[1:42:34] mind is the mount is the mind of jesus
[1:42:37] amen is to have the mind of christ
[1:42:40] is to mind the things of christ and that
[1:42:43] mind
[1:42:44] lead and guide you into the perfect ways
[1:42:47] of the lord
[1:42:49] because we're because if we have that
[1:42:51] mind we do the things that god tells us
[1:42:53] to do
[1:42:54] by his spirit one more scripture i'm
[1:42:57] gonna go ahead and close here it's
[1:42:58] getting late
[1:42:59] romans uh romans chapter eight
[1:43:03] let's begin reading with the 14th verse
[1:43:05] romans 8 14.
[1:43:09] listen this now as we close romans 8 14
[1:43:13] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:43:16] god
[1:43:17] they are the sons of god not physically
[1:43:20] but spiritually for ye no
[1:43:24] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:43:27] bondage again to fear
[1:43:29] you have not listen you have not
[1:43:33] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:43:36] fear
[1:43:38] which is exactly what the world's trying
[1:43:40] to do to you
[1:43:41] right that's exactly what satan's eden
[1:43:44] is offering you
[1:43:45] his bondage to bind you to bind you to
[1:43:48] what
[1:43:49] to him but god's not giving us that
[1:43:52] spirit of bondage to fear
[1:43:54] but you have received the spirit of
[1:43:56] adoption whereby we cry
[1:43:58] about father what does the spirit of
[1:44:01] adoption tell us
[1:44:02] that we belong to god we are a part of
[1:44:05] the family
[1:44:07] i am a son or daughter of god if i am
[1:44:09] his child then i'm responsible to him
[1:44:12] not all the other am i to god that's my
[1:44:15] responsibility
[1:44:16] because i am a part of the family of god
[1:44:19] and if i'm part of the family of god
[1:44:21] then god treats me as such the spirit
[1:44:24] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:44:26] that we
[1:44:27] are the children of god amen because we
[1:44:30] are born
[1:44:31] into that family by that one spirit and
[1:44:34] that one spirit then
[1:44:35] dictates to us and our lives are hidden
[1:44:38] in him
[1:44:40] yes
[1:44:43] satan and the world they try to
[1:44:46] glamorize
[1:44:48] the demonic powers the demonic spirits
[1:44:51] friend but don't
[1:44:52] don't fall into that
[1:44:56] i i know when i was a kid we used to
[1:44:58] watch that show
[1:45:00] the blonde lady was on it and she'd
[1:45:02] twinkle her nose and
[1:45:03] and people would appear people would
[1:45:05] disappear and things would move and all
[1:45:07] this stuff and
[1:45:08] oh wow how neat
[1:45:12] but that's of the devil that's satanic
[1:45:15] power yes that's not the power that
[1:45:17] we're looking for
[1:45:18] that's the power that's self-serving
[1:45:21] we're looking for the power that we want
[1:45:23] to help and serve others
[1:45:25] the power of god the power that takes us
[1:45:28] from this mortal reach
[1:45:29] into an immortality it takes us from
[1:45:32] from this
[1:45:33] uh flesh life into a spirit life into an
[1:45:36] eternal life
[1:45:37] a perfect eden with god
[1:45:41] amen amen beyond this life god has not
[1:45:44] given us
[1:45:46] god has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:45:49] but he's given us the spirit of power
[1:45:52] and of love
[1:45:53] and of a sound mind amen amen god bless
[1:45:56] you let's stand if we could
[1:46:08] praise the lord
[1:46:16] lord help us amen it's so easy for the
[1:46:20] things of the world
[1:46:22] and the things that satan puts before us
[1:46:24] to take over us sometimes
[1:46:26] we get fearful for our families and we
[1:46:28] get fearful of
[1:46:31] our food or home or
[1:46:34] paying the bills or sickness or
[1:46:38] disease or affliction or uh most
[1:46:40] commonly covet 19 or whatever it is
[1:46:43] but god has given us a spirit of love
[1:46:48] power let's turn to 271.
