[0:01] well welcome back sorry about that
[0:04] anyway continuing on I wanted to monitor
[0:07] our conversation again I've been told by
[0:10] different brothers years ago that unless
[0:13] you pass the plate in church that people
[0:15] wouldn't give and always was against
[0:18] that not necessarily because and not
[0:21] against passing the plate but against
[0:23] that thought process because I always
[0:24] felt like that God's children were there
[0:26] and they were led of God that that they
[0:30] would do what the Bible says and and
[0:33] that's I believe what the Bible does say
[0:34] I tried it and it worked in Florida and
[0:39] I've tried it and it worked here and
[0:41] that being said I appreciate very much
[0:46] you precious Saints there's not a basket
[0:49] or a box or a plate to push around er or
[0:51] pass around or to put anything in but
[0:54] you've driven by our place and we've
[0:56] gone by yours and the mail and different
[0:59] things just to try to make sure that the
[1:02] time is an offering that you have to the
[1:04] Lord that you bring for us and it's
[1:07] rinna it's been a tremendous tremendous
[1:09] blessing and I want to punish you for
[1:11] that that you don't get that just
[1:13] everywhere and it's not something that
[1:15] we talk about it's not something that we
[1:17] push you to or that you have to pledge
[1:21] to you do it up your own free will and
[1:24] then from your heart and that's what the
[1:26] Bible says God rewards you and bless you
[1:29] I told I asked the Lord the other day to
[1:31] return a hundredfold to you for the
[1:34] blessings that you do now it's not your
[1:36] money it's not my money it's God's we
[1:39] just happen to be the stewards that
[1:40] God's Word commands us to be and but I
[1:44] won't admonish you precious godly people
[1:47] you obey the word and God bless you for
[1:50] it so let's just remember these requests
[1:52] now and we'll go to the Lord in prayer
[1:54] pray for the the service now and for
[1:58] these requests as we bow our heads
[1:59] together Lord Jesus father we are indeed

[3:09] we're looking forward for you to speak
[3:11] to us Lord now from your word we pray
[3:14] that you move upon every prayer request
[3:15] every need that was mentioned everyone
[3:18] that was made known Lord and God the
[3:20] praise reports were so thankful of the
[3:22] positive reports from brother Johnnie

[3:35] hearts today continue to comfort and be
[3:37] with Aliya Lord brother Dennis's wife
[3:39] may you touch her and help her keep her
[3:41] safe Lord had G CH one of us about Lord
[3:44] with your holy angels to keep us
[3:46] protected from all the germs and
[3:48] diseases in the world for we don't live
[3:50] by fear but we live by faith and we
[3:53] thank you God for the faith from the Son
[3:55] of God to deliver us and bring us into
[3:57] your presence god I pray that you would
[4:00] speak to us Lord now and may you
[4:02] minister through your word God into our
[4:04] hearts reveal your word to us once again
[4:07] rich
[4:08] true today as we commit it to you in the
[4:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[4:12] amen amen
[4:15] well praise the Lord let's go to our
[4:17] Bibles now we're going to go back over
[4:19] to Romans chapter eight and I want to
[4:24] speak today more along the lines of the
[4:28] process of new birth but I'm going to
[4:30] title it again justification so it's
[4:33] gonna be justification part three but
[4:35] you see it got the board back up here
[4:36] and and all that it goes through but
[4:39] look at the scripture and I believe I
[4:41] had you last week to maybe if you had
[4:44] the time which I'm imagining most of us
[4:46] are a home and I had a little bit of
[4:48] time to listen to the future home of the
[4:51] heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride if
[4:53] you haven't do I'm gonna go into that a
[4:56] little bit today a little bit more than
[4:59] I did last week so if you want to listen
[5:02] that feel free to do so
[5:04] amen but Romans chapter 8 we just want
[5:08] to read this one verse of scripture
[5:09] again verse 33 it says who shall lay
[5:13] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[5:15] is God that justified amen
[5:19] it's God to justify sin so that's the
[5:21] subject we would want to give into today
[5:23] although we're going to go again into
[5:25] more of a whole love of the new birth
[5:28] and and the difference that it makes in
[5:32] our lives of the new birth and the sin
[5:37] and the things that we have in our lives
[5:40] and the things that happen in our lives
[5:42] and and and the process that it goes
[5:44] through and why things are they are when
[5:47] you're born and remember born again or
[5:51] born in sin shaped and equity come in
[5:53] the world speaking lies or being born
[5:55] again of the Spirit of God amen so let's
[5:59] go over to first Peter and I want to
[6:02] begin reading there again read a couple
[6:09] of verses of Scripture from first Peter
[6:11] chapter 1 beginning with verse 22 as a
[6:15] couple of particular points I want to
[6:17] make here today and
[6:19] so we'll get to those and maybe when we
[6:23] get to those particular things I want to
[6:24] point out the other things we just kind
[6:27] of bring along the line to bring us to
[6:28] those points that hopefully would be a
[6:31] help and a blessing to you today first
[6:33] Peter chapter 1 verse 22 says seeing you
[6:36] have purified your souls in obeying the
[6:40] truth so obeying the truth is pure pure
[6:44] ofin to the soul how does that
[6:46] purification come when the Holy Spirit
[6:48] comes in when you obey the word Peter
[6:51] said repent be baptized in the name of
[6:53] Jesus Christ remission of sin and you
[6:55] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[6:57] that's the promise that we have obeying
[6:59] that word brings us in personal contact
[7:02] with the Holy Spirit brings that Holy
[7:04] Spirit promise into our lives because we
[7:07] obeyed the word purifying our souls
[7:10] remember our souls first of all were
[7:12] born of a sin nature we're born with a
[7:15] snake nature of the devil in there that
[7:17] the nature the children of Wrath but it
[7:20] purified us when we obeyed the word
[7:22] obeying the word repentance baptism
[7:25] coming into the fulfilling of the Holy
[7:27] Spirit in our lives
[7:29] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[7:32] now peter mitching of course love or the
[7:37] love without hypocrisy this love is that
[7:40] is the gap a love that's without
[7:43] unfeigned means without hypocrisy it
[7:46] means a true love of this of the
[7:48] Brethren see that ye love one another
[7:50] with a pure heart fervently and bourbon
[7:53] is burning with passionate 23rd verse
[7:57] being born again again like I said
[8:00] that's what I want to talk about in the
[8:01] wholeness of this is a new birth being
[8:04] born again not of corruptible seed but
[8:07] of incorruptible seed remember our first
[8:11] birth was a corrupt seed our new birth
[8:14] is an incorruptible seed the first birth
[8:17] was with the wrong nature the new birth
[8:20] is with the nature of God that seed of
[8:22] God that God planted in there
[8:23] predestined then there before the
[8:25] foundation of the world so not of that
[8:27] incorruptible seed but of in
[8:31] by the Word of God amen remember John 1
[8:35] says in the beginning was the word the
[8:38] word logos that word logos is the
[8:40] completion of God is the completion of
[8:44] his word is the completion of who he is
[8:46] that logos came out of God and began to
[8:49] create that logos condon send it down
[8:52] into Melchizedek and and and the pillar
[8:57] of fire and the pillar of cloud and and
[8:59] come eventually into Jesus Christ and
[9:01] that same one is in us today it's the
[9:04] same it's the word Christ is the word
[9:06] God is the word the man in that word now
[9:09] as we see is uncorruptible is the word
[9:14] of God which liveth and abideth for ever
[9:16] live it than if I because once it's in
[9:19] there it's sealed remember we read
[9:21] Ephesians 1 sealed into your destination
[9:23] right so when you're sealed in there by
[9:25] the Holy Spirit promise of God then
[9:27] you're still there to your eternal
[9:29] destination it abideth forever
[9:31] incorruptible now look how the word puts
[9:33] this well Peter says here
[9:35] Peter says the incorruptible seed a seed
[9:39] what is the seed a seed is a beginning
[9:42] of life seed is is the is the holder of
[9:47] life any seed that come as God had
[9:51] created in the beginning come regardless
[9:53] of what seed it is I'm watching the
[9:56] beautiful birds flying around to help in
[9:57] my backyard and the trees and and the
[9:59] grass and all of those things came from
[10:01] seeds humans we all come from seed
[10:04] there's a seed that comes from somewhere
[10:06] that is predestined foreordained to come
[10:10] to life man
[10:11] talked about that brothers should care
[10:13] and I believe that took him and showed
[10:14] him how the Bulls reproduced and cows
[10:17] and animals reproduced and the eggs and
[10:21] the the sperm and the the reproduction
[10:23] process and but that's it that's that
[10:26] seed that's predestined brother Branham
[10:29] used it it's like a one-in-a-million
[10:31] scenario a thousand a million seeds come
[10:33] out but only one is or day
[10:34] to life there's there's a seed of a tree
[10:37] out there it's if it's put in the right
[10:40] ground in the right atmosphere and given
[10:42] water that seed will will obey the law
[10:45] of God that law of God is it and will
[10:47] reproduce it will come to life so if
[10:50] it's talking about an incorruptible seed
[10:52] is talking about something that has life
[10:55] in it something that is the arbiter the
[10:58] beginning of life
[10:59] it is life itself where did that life
[11:03] come from well if it's incorruptible
[11:05] there's only one place it could come
[11:06] from everything we have in the world
[11:09] everything we look at in our today is
[11:11] corruptible so world would end
[11:12] corruption come from its God so it's a
[11:15] seed of God the incorruptible seed of
[11:18] God that comes and lives with us we're
[11:20] so that new birth now again it says
[11:23] being born again Jesus told Nicodemus
[11:25] lest you be born again you can't even
[11:28] see the kingdom of heaven
[11:29] so beautifu again of incorruptible seed
[11:34] behind the word of God amen that's the
[11:37] word of God now some people believe that
[11:39] you that you don't receive that seed
[11:41] until the word comes in you I am
[11:46] contrary to that a lot of thoughts going
[11:48] through my mind right now I'm not going
[11:50] to say of other things that I've heard
[11:53] that people believe that I just don't
[11:55] see how it works with the word nor do I
[11:57] see how that works with the I know it
[11:59] says here by the Word of God but the
[12:02] truth of it is if that seed wasn't
[12:04] already there for the Spirit to come and
[12:07] strike it then whatever word comes
[12:10] whatever word a person hears is is going
[12:14] to be null and void is that word is
[12:17] going to be no effect it can be the same
[12:19] word that we're reading right now but
[12:20] it's not going to mean anything to those
[12:22] people unless that was already there the
[12:25] predestinated seat of God has always
[12:28] been there the word of God through the
[12:31] Spirit of God just brings life the
[12:34] washing of the water of the word the
[12:36] word through water washing brings life
[12:39] to that scene just like if you water a
[12:42] scene of grass
[12:45] in our apartment's here we got
[12:46] sprinklers out here that's watering the
[12:49] grass out here and it's starting to turn
[12:50] green the sprinklers out in front of our
[12:52] apartment aren't working and all the
[12:54] city all the grass is dying because
[12:56] there's no water so when the water comes
[12:59] in his the seed the seed comes to life
[13:01] not the other way around
[13:03] it's like some people believe you got to
[13:05] get all the attributes of the statue of
[13:08] a perfect man before you get the Holy
[13:09] Ghost
[13:10] well I contend you can't get to those
[13:12] statues unless you have the Holy Ghost
[13:14] it's a new birth Peter didn't say repent
[13:18] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[13:20] remission of sin and then establish each
[13:22] one of these steps that you have to
[13:24] follow then you can get the Holy Ghost
[13:26] no no that's not what the Bible says so
[13:28] we got to follow what the Bible says we
[13:30] can't go by Manas ideas or opinions what
[13:33] does the Bible say the Bible says an
[13:36] incorruptible seed by the word I know
[13:39] the word is the seed it's the washing of
[13:41] the water that brings life to that seed
[13:44] to that word amen so listen to this now
[13:47] for all flesh the flesh now is as grass
[13:51] and all the glory of man as the flower
[13:54] of grass the grass withereth and the
[13:57] flower thereof falleth away just like
[14:00] the flesh just like the man just from
[14:03] the fall of the Garden of Eden each one
[14:04] of us from dust thou art told us that
[14:07] we'll return it's like the grass of the
[14:10] flower of the grass follows the way but
[14:13] the word of the Lord now that word is
[14:15] Rhema that word is not low Goss Rhema is
[14:18] a specific word that's spoken for a
[14:21] specific time specific purpose that is a
[14:24] part of the the logos it came from the
[14:28] logos but it was a specific something
[14:30] spoken of a word of the Lord endureth
[14:33] forever and this is the word again
[14:36] that's Rhema which by the gospel is
[14:38] preached to you amen now I can't
[14:41] understand
[14:42] the the preaching why God used the
[14:45] preaching of the word to save souls
[14:46] that's that's God's choice but that word
[14:49] endureth that word of of the gospel that
[14:53] word the Lord which was preached
[14:55] endureth because it reaches a place in
[14:59] you that brings life and and you know
[15:03] what that line comes people say well can
[15:05] you prove it you get it and you won't
[15:08] need proof it once it happens to you
[15:11] you'll know you know you don't have to
[15:13] prove it then people say well how do you
[15:14] know you'll know that then there's
[15:16] hardly any better way to say it well can
[15:18] you scientifically prove it no but what
[15:21] can and can't science prove today
[15:23] there's a lot of things science proof
[15:25] twenty fifteen hundred years ago that
[15:27] they can't prove today or that's
[15:28] contrary today than what they did since
[15:31] can you say it's better than this it's
[15:34] it comes by personal experience so when
[15:37] you know it you have it you don't have
[15:39] to ask that question anymore because you
[15:41] know what's in you you know what you
[15:43] know that it has already been done so
[15:45] that word of the Lord endureth forever
[15:47] and the word of the Lord which by the
[15:50] gospel is preached unto you now I want
[15:52] to read a particular a specific quote
[15:54] here and again like I said from future
[15:57] home if you want to again try to try to
[16:00] if you did in this week listen to future
[16:02] home I believe it would be a blessing to
[16:07] you it's a place where the Brown talks
[16:09] about an eighth day that we got into
[16:11] last week talked about eternity and time
[16:14] rolling over into eternity into the
[16:16] Millennium but it also talks about this
[16:20] which we get into just a little bit here
[16:22] now listen this is from future home look
[16:25] them hands design this for his beloved
[16:28] bride God's hands designed this earth
[16:31] this place for his beloved and bride
[16:34] debt designed in tenderly love for his
[16:38] bride remember that the Holy Ghost the
[16:42] sin descended on Jesus which Jesus was a
[16:47] part of the earth was flesh come and
[16:49] likeness of sinful place he was a part
[16:52] of the earth why'd the German
[16:54] God the life of God was designed in the
[16:57] womb of a woman is that right he says
[16:59] now which it which was the earth
[17:02] she was the earth he was from the earth
[17:04] that flesh was from the earth all right
[17:06] then and the life of God came in so he
[17:09] was the beginning of the creation of God
[17:12] again revelation 3 see and then that
[17:16] blood that blood of God that was there
[17:19] by the germ when it was shed at Calvary
[17:22] dropped back upon the earth for what to
[17:25] redeem the earth now he's talking about
[17:27] and we're entering into this quote
[17:29] reading in the process of the redemption
[17:32] of the earth and when he talks about
[17:34] Christ dying at Calvary and the blood
[17:37] dropping on the earth to redeem the
[17:39] earth he's talking about the the
[17:42] redemption process of the earth that God
[17:45] played just like he does us so the
[17:48] dropping of the blood from Calvary on
[17:50] the earth redeemed the earth it
[17:52] purchased the earth back to himself now
[17:54] now it's justified it's been sanctified
[17:57] called claimed and now it's to receive
[17:59] its baptism of fire and be cleansed for
[18:02] Jesus now listen that real close we'll
[18:05] get back to that in just a minute
[18:06] cleanse for Jesus and his bride and you
[18:09] are those other parts that's drawn out
[18:12] of this earth you are listen now you are
[18:16] a part of the earth your body do we just
[18:19] talked about flesh we just read the
[18:21] first Peter flesh you are part of the
[18:24] earth your body your soul is part of God
[18:28] an attribute of God displayed here on
[18:31] earth in a body the now that soul that
[18:34] soul is God amen that soul that seed
[18:38] that come forth to bring life and then
[18:40] that belongs to God that is God it
[18:42] doesn't just belong to God it is God
[18:44] that seat is God that seat is just that
[18:47] part of you who he is that he placed in
[18:49] you see because if you were an attribute
[18:52] of thought of God you always were a part
[18:53] of God just like the thought that I
[18:55] might have right now is part of me you
[18:58] can actually see that even in our
[19:01] copyright laws in this country if I have
[19:04] a unique thought and
[19:06] I can pin that unique thought the book
[19:08] and I can copyright that book and if
[19:10] anybody else tries to steal that Fogg
[19:12] and claim it as their own they can get
[19:15] sued by me because that was my thought
[19:17] it's like it's a part of me
[19:20] it's my intelligent or intellectual
[19:23] property it's a part of me see I just
[19:26] happened to put it on a book and for
[19:28] everybody to read and enjoy what my
[19:30] thought was and if somebody tries to
[19:32] steal that then they're a thief because
[19:34] that's me that's part of me well that
[19:37] thought is God and what God expressed
[19:39] that fall down in here in the earth he
[19:41] he put it on these books he put it in
[19:43] these earthen vessels these human beans
[19:45] us so that it can be read ball man
[19:48] we read the pistols read of all been so
[19:51] weird that intellectual property of God
[19:53] that God put down there now if anybody
[19:56] tries to steal from it or take any claim
[19:58] that is your own there a thief and a
[19:59] robber but we belong to God so that part
[20:02] of him that is him it's just that fault
[20:05] that he put out here that's expressed to
[20:07] us that's who we are where it gives
[20:08] intellectual property in the world in
[20:12] the United States at least you can be
[20:14] sued for trying to steal somebody's
[20:15] intellectual property but we are that
[20:19] part of God see your soul is that part
[20:23] of God that's that part of God an
[20:25] attribute of God displayed on earth in a
[20:27] body the body is the bodies listed as
[20:31] them the bodies to be redeemed amen now
[20:36] the souls been redeemed because it was
[20:40] in sin was in sin so remember this is
[20:43] the process that we're talking about
[20:45] we'll get to the justification
[20:47] sanctification Holy Ghost so just like
[20:49] you remember the glass in the chicken
[20:51] yard you know you take the glass out of
[20:53] the chicken yard that's justification
[20:54] it's it's no longer in the chicken yard
[20:57] you take it you wash it you clean it up
[20:59] that sanctification and it's nice
[21:02] beautiful pristine glass but it's still
[21:04] not doing anything but until it's filled
[21:06] with something a beverage water or
[21:09] something to be put into use that's the
[21:10] filling of the Holy Ghost and that's
[21:13] that simplicity of that of that birth
[21:15] the justification was taken out of the
[21:17] cheek
[21:18] it's no longer there anymore amen it's
[21:21] it's it's not a part of that life
[21:23] anymore now see that that soul that's
[21:26] redeemed see for the ground spring is to
[21:30] the point of redemption it has been
[21:32] redeemed if you're in that place of a
[21:35] person in the part of new birth as we
[21:38] just read born again of incorruptible
[21:41] seed you've been born again
[21:44] that your soul has been redeemed your
[21:47] body is to be redeemed amen but listen
[21:51] to the process you say oh well then then
[21:54] our bodies are just here in the world of
[21:56] course or stinky flesh sweet it's just
[21:58] the body I was born with other than
[22:01] getting older and a few more wrinkles
[22:03] and aches and pains and a couple of
[22:06] haircuts in my life I'm saying God what
[22:08] I was born same flesh but it's in the
[22:13] process listen it was the soul was in
[22:17] sin so God the soul was in sin amen I
[22:21] want to bring that down to us in a few
[22:23] minutes we get to our next scripture
[22:25] reading but the soul was in sin so God
[22:28] come down by process of justification
[22:31] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[22:33] and redeemed your soul you be part of
[22:37] the earth is redeemed by it you're in
[22:39] the process now it's going on the
[22:43] process of what the redemption of these
[22:45] bodies you go read Romans eight we'll
[22:48] read Romans eight but we won't get to
[22:50] this part of Romans eight but that that
[22:52] new birth or redemption the completion
[22:55] of the redemption ends and I believe
[22:57] it's Romans 8:23 to wit that is to say
[23:00] the redemption of our bodies it's
[23:04] already a process now because the soul
[23:08] has been redeemed which brings the
[23:10] spirit into subjection which brings the
[23:12] body under subjection to the word it's
[23:15] already in process but
[23:17] hasn't received its full Redemption yet
[23:19] so it still lives in sin it still lives
[23:22] in a sinful world it still has sinful
[23:25] thoughts it still has things it comes up
[23:27] from our memories and conscience reason
[23:29] there's still those things that affect
[23:31] us in our body and in our spirit but not
[23:34] in our soul because our soul has been
[23:37] changed it is God now it's not of this
[23:40] old nature it's of God's nature so it's
[23:43] a different it's a different place of of
[23:47] sitting if you will or or disbelief but
[23:51] hold on to that because we'll get back
[23:53] to that in just a moment but he's
[23:55] talking about now we've been through
[23:58] justification sanctification baptism the
[24:00] Holy Ghost in the baptism of the Holy
[24:02] Ghost you know makes a way they baptism
[24:05] simply an anointing but that baptism
[24:08] makes a way for the person of Christ
[24:11] this seed to live in you amen that
[24:15] baptism is a cleansing it's an anointing
[24:19] that a-19 of this the anointing of this
[24:23] body Spirit allows that Holy Spirit to
[24:26] bring life to that seed so now God is in
[24:29] there that's God living but that
[24:32] anointing comes to allow a process for
[24:35] that to happen
[24:36] that's a baptism a lot of people say
[24:38] well you have the baptism of Holy Ghost
[24:40] well brother Graham said in modern
[24:42] events you can have the baptism dump
[24:44] needing your going in because the
[24:46] baptism is just an anointing a baptism
[24:48] is just a covering you can get the
[24:51] absolute genuine Holy Spirit of God
[24:54] anointed of your body and spirit and die
[24:56] and go to hell it's the soul that
[24:59] matters it's the inside of the inside
[25:01] that matters
[25:02] you can't live based on some gifts or
[25:04] some anointing you've got to live based
[25:06] on the fact that God has changed your
[25:08] soul and made you a new creature not
[25:12] just some going to church or being a
[25:15] pious person it's not about that it's
[25:17] about being born again having God Christ
[25:21] living in you that at baptism makes your
[25:24] way for the person of Christ to come
[25:26] you will get up you see what I'm talking
[25:28] about that person of Christ to come
[25:30] living you God living in you the baptism
[25:33] just makes a way for that Amen that Holy
[25:36] Spirit now he says though the baptism of
[25:41] the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul
[25:43] praise the Lord redeemed the past tense
[25:46] your soul and you've been part of the
[25:49] earth this body you be part of the earth
[25:53] it's redeemed by the process of the
[25:57] redemption that led to the new birth
[26:00] amen so when God took and and brought in
[26:05] a new birth to redeem the soul he got
[26:09] the body in the spirit at the same time
[26:12] amen look now you can't you you
[26:17] you can have justification without
[26:19] having sanctification you can have
[26:20] justification of sanctity about home the
[26:22] Holy Ghost but you can't have just case
[26:25] you Saints case the Holy Ghost without
[26:27] being Saints fighter justify you can't
[26:28] have the Holy Ghost without having the
[26:30] first two so if you've been born again
[26:32] it God's cleanse your soul he's redeemed
[26:34] his intellectual property then your body
[26:37] and your spirit come with it it's it's a
[26:40] package deal you can have the you can
[26:43] have an anointing on the body and not be
[26:45] born again truth but if you're born
[26:46] again the body's been redeemed look now
[26:50] he said it's redeemed by gift by what by
[26:54] the souls Redemption it's being a part
[26:58] of the earth is redeemed by it you're in
[27:00] the process amen a process the process
[27:04] is something that has a beginning has a
[27:06] time period and has an end
[27:08] well that process is going on right now
[27:11] there was a time when we were bored
[27:14] again and brought our bodies under
[27:15] subjection to that spirit but there's
[27:18] good and that processes going on now but
[27:20] when this body change hits and we go in
[27:23] a rapture that's going to be the
[27:24] combination of it it's going to be the
[27:26] end of that process the process is now
[27:29] going on but there's going to be an end
[27:32] to that process when this body takes a
[27:35] change
[27:35] when this corruptible put some in
[27:37] corruption not just the soul
[27:39] incorruptible seed but the body the body
[27:43] puts on the in corruption
[27:44] that's the fullness of the redemption
[27:46] that's why Paul said and Romans 8:23 to
[27:50] wit the redemption of our bodies of our
[27:54] bodies what is that the completion of
[27:56] what God paid for they did the earth the
[27:59] same way this earth that God remember
[28:02] back in the Garden of Eden when when
[28:04] when Adam lost his inheritance he lost
[28:06] his inheritance in life he lost his
[28:08] inheritance to the to the book of life
[28:11] he lost his inheritance to the world he
[28:14] had to he was a mature god of this world
[28:17] he could speak namesake do whatever he
[28:18] wanted in this world because involved in
[28:20] him God put Adam as as as his son as an
[28:25] immature God he put Adam in charge
[28:27] complete charge of this earth because he
[28:30] had the mind of God he had the Spirit of
[28:32] God he had the will of God he had the
[28:33] purpose of God everything about animals
[28:35] God so God had confidence in his son to
[28:38] know that what decisions he was going to
[28:40] make would be exactly what he would have
[28:42] made in him and that sings and that's
[28:45] what his trust and he puts in I believe
[28:47] he puts trust in his children again
[28:49] today it's just like a natural parent in
[28:52] her and her natural children there comes
[28:54] a time where you've turned that child
[28:57] and you've raised that child and you got
[28:59] to bring that child of the place that
[29:00] that they make their own decisions and
[29:02] they can make their own decisions we
[29:05] might not always agree with them as
[29:06] parents but they're going to make their
[29:08] own decisions and a lot of times those
[29:11] decisions are going to be based on what
[29:14] how they were raised and what mom and
[29:17] daddy thought and how what we instilled
[29:19] in them as parents that becomes a lot of
[29:23] the decision-making that they make now
[29:24] they do their own decisions and they do
[29:26] their own thing because we're humans but
[29:28] God Adam was that God child that God son
[29:32] they got had 100% confidence in and we
[29:36] get grown up enough as children of God
[29:38] God
[29:39] suss to make the decisions that are
[29:41] right for us to be led of God and for us
[29:45] to fulfill the perfect will of God for
[29:46] our lives he entrusts us with that
[29:49] that's a part of that three will
[29:51] we're free won't agents because God
[29:55] trusts us as children now there's others
[29:58] that are free moral agents to have a
[30:00] free will to do whatever they want live
[30:03] whatever life they want and people do
[30:04] that the God still did not take away our
[30:08] free moral agency he did not even though
[30:11] what stole we've been born again did not
[30:13] take away our free will because God
[30:16] wants us and allows us to make our own
[30:18] decisions and and go our own way and do
[30:20] her own things and he has confidence
[30:21] enough with his Spirit in there that is
[30:24] we are grown and we continue to move by
[30:26] the Spirit of God that we're going to
[30:27] make the decisions in life and we try to
[30:30] look now we try to we don't always do it
[30:33] perfect but we try to do it exactly the
[30:36] way God would do it if God were standing
[30:39] here in my mind and my body and my flesh
[30:42] God would do it like this and not
[30:45] believe God trusts us that way well it
[30:47] was it was a one hundred percent with
[30:49] Adam because he was there was no sin he
[30:52] was the spoken word of God Adam was but
[30:54] when he lost this earth he lost his
[30:57] inheritance in this earth the he lost
[30:58] his inheritance in life well this earth
[31:01] belonged to God
[31:02] see God's got a big just like we belong
[31:05] to God so dogs got to bring this earth
[31:07] back into his possession because it was
[31:09] rightfully lost to Satan
[31:12] it was rightfully lost it was out of his
[31:15] hands and if it was rightfully lost to
[31:17] Satan and Satan had control of it and
[31:19] Satan still does this is still Satan's
[31:21] Eden you see the coronavirus is a very
[31:24] good example of that and everything else
[31:26] is going on and and all but it still
[31:29] belongs to God this is where we're going
[31:31] to live friends this is where the
[31:33] Millennium is going to be set up this is
[31:34] where the new city the New Jerusalem is
[31:37] going to be said of us right here on
[31:38] this earth so this belongs to God don't
[31:40] belong it didn't Satan's possession but
[31:43] it no longer belongs to him but why he
[31:46] rightfully lost it Adam rightfully lost
[31:48] it to Satan so Satan is in control of it
[31:51] but God had to bring
[31:52] well how did he bring it back you had to
[31:55] bring it back into his possession
[31:56] exactly the same way that he brings us
[31:59] back into his possession
[32:01] first there was a baptism of this earth
[32:04] by Noah and the flood that was the
[32:06] justification that the blood come and
[32:08] the sanctified it cleanse it by his
[32:11] blood that we just read here his blood
[32:13] dripped upon the earth to redeem this
[32:15] earth back by his own blood
[32:17] now this earth listen this now you think
[32:21] whoa
[32:21] if God's brought this back and he's
[32:23] justified he cleansed it and and he's
[32:26] and he put it in the pan the position
[32:30] for us to possess it once again now we
[32:33] know there's going to come a fiery
[32:34] baptism the the Bible says the elements
[32:38] are going to melt with fervent heat so
[32:41] we know that that's going to happen but
[32:44] the place that it's at now and you think
[32:47] well yeah but it's still in such a
[32:49] horrible condition it's still Satan's
[32:52] Eden it absolutely is why because this
[32:55] earth just like so many people is caught
[32:59] right now it's in the place of between
[33:02] sanctification and Bethan and Holy Ghost
[33:06] this earth is in that place that's why
[33:09] it's still the way it is we can operate
[33:12] here and live here as children of God as
[33:14] born-again sons and daughters of God but
[33:17] this earth itself and we've been
[33:19] redeemed but remember these bodies are
[33:21] still here still a part of the earth
[33:24] still a part of the ground still the
[33:26] sticky flesh still the same guy that's
[33:29] born in this this flesh you looking at
[33:33] you said well you haven't changed much
[33:35] well you look down on the inside the
[33:37] inside you'll see I've changed a whole
[33:38] lot but you look at this guy on the
[33:41] flesh you say why you your picture looks
[33:43] like this and you look like this and you
[33:45] look like your mom you look like your
[33:46] dad or you look like when you were 10 or
[33:48] whatever it is you'd say well yeah
[33:50] because that's I'm still in this place
[33:51] you look at the earth you say while the
[33:53] earth is the way it is but this earth is
[33:56] still in the position
[33:57] still in Satan's eatin because it's in
[33:59] between the sanctification we've had the
[34:02] dropping of God's blood on the earth but
[34:06] we haven't had our fiery baptism yet on
[34:08] this earth so when that comes that will
[34:11] be the to wit the redemption of the
[34:15] earth that will be the completion of
[34:18] that Redemption just like we've been
[34:20] redeemed but the completion of our
[34:23] Redemption doesn't take place until
[34:25] these bodies are redeemed to wit the
[34:28] redemption of our bodies that Earth is
[34:30] in the same place you're in the process
[34:33] now see the Earth's in the process we're
[34:37] in the process we live in Satan's even
[34:39] because Satan's Eden because this earth
[34:41] is between sanctification and receiving
[34:44] it's fiery baptism and it will and when
[34:47] it does then it be fit for God and His
[34:50] brighter for us to come and live here
[34:51] the Millennium is going to take place
[34:53] and and then the white throne judgment
[35:00] and the new City God's gonna bring all
[35:03] into possession into his position at
[35:06] that time but it's in the process now
[35:08] it's in the process your body was
[35:11] justified under Noah's baptism why
[35:14] because we're part of the earth if we're
[35:17] part of the earth and being a part of
[35:19] the earth our bodies were justified then
[35:21] amen and your flesh when it dropped upon
[35:24] there it was justified at that moment at
[35:28] that time let's look at some scripture
[35:31] reading again go over to first John
[35:34] what am i one of my favorites I guess I
[35:37] could say I bring this scripture up on
[35:44] many occasion
[35:45] other sermons because it brings such a
[35:49] clear view and a total synopsis of of
[35:54] what's going on in our lives now I've
[35:57] had people say well you know when when
[36:03] you know you sin willfully or you don't
[36:09] to try to put somebody into place even
[36:12] though they've had a new birth that
[36:15] they'll never ever make another mistake
[36:17] or never ever have a sin as will say
[36:20] again puts that person in the place of
[36:24] of angelic or godly perfection in their
[36:28] flesh when our flesh has not been
[36:30] redeemed yet our soul has been redeemed
[36:33] but our body has not so we'll keep that
[36:38] in mind as we continue or go into this
[36:41] read first John chapter 3 I want to
[36:42] begin in verse 1 again I read this I've
[36:46] read this several times but just for the
[36:47] sake of bringing this together now first
[36:50] John 1 first john one says if we say we
[36:54] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[36:57] truth is not in us if we confess our
[36:59] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[37:01] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[37:03] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[37:07] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[37:09] word is not in us that's first desk
[37:12] first john 1 but now look at first john
[37:15] 3 first john 3 says behold what manner
[37:18] of love that's agape love the father has
[37:22] bestowed upon us that we should be
[37:25] called the sons of god we're still even
[37:28] in this sticky flesh called the sons of
[37:31] god because that's the love of god that
[37:33] he has for us
[37:34] it's his sovereignty therefore the world
[37:38] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[37:41] so the world doesn't know us this world
[37:44] what world war cosmos this world order
[37:47] doesn't know us because it didn't know
[37:49] him and rejected him and rejects us
[37:51] because were a part of him beloved now
[37:55] are we the sons of God amen
[37:58] and it does not yet appear or manifest
[38:01] to to the world what we shall be but we
[38:05] know that when he shall appear we shall
[38:08] be like him for we shall see him as he
[38:12] is and every man that had this hope in
[38:16] him purifies himself even as he
[38:19] pure so we do what we do of our free
[38:23] will to live a godly life we live the
[38:28] godly life from our decision we live a
[38:31] godly life from our own free will
[38:33] because we decide to do that when we
[38:36] decide that we want to do and live the
[38:38] way God wants us to live then that's of
[38:40] our own free will
[38:42] God didn't force us to do it we do it
[38:43] because we love him everyman pure define
[38:47] himself even as God is pure whosoever
[38:52] committeth sin transgresseth also the
[38:56] law for sin is the transgression of the
[38:59] law
[39:00] I remember what sin is sin is unbelief
[39:04] sin comes because a person does not
[39:06] believe you can say and you know that he
[39:10] was manifested Jesus Christ was
[39:13] manifested to take away our sins and in
[39:17] him is no sin now I've said this before
[39:21] and I don't want to change the word but
[39:24] you could look at this word and say that
[39:27] he took away our sins because there was
[39:31] no sin in him the only way he could take
[39:35] our sins was because he was sinless
[39:37] the reason others holding him good godly
[39:41] man could not take away our sins or be
[39:43] our sacrifice is because they were born
[39:46] in sins shaped innate when he come the
[39:47] world speaking lies Jesus Christ was not
[39:50] he was the created blood of God that
[39:53] seed that was placed in Mary that God
[39:56] that thought attribute put in Mary
[39:58] became Jesus Christ the logos come in
[40:02] the fullness of the godhead dwell in him
[40:04] well that was nothing more than God
[40:07] himself well God there is a sinless God
[40:11] than if he's sinless and he can take our
[40:14] sins from us so he took away our sins he
[40:18] was manifested to take away our sin and
[40:20] in him is no sin whosoever abideth in
[40:25] him listen now
[40:26] whosoever invited in him
[40:29] sinneth not ok now we're getting
[40:32] somewhere
[40:32] whosoever abideth in Christ sin if not
[40:36] so if you're abiding in Christ you
[40:39] cannot sin
[40:40] understand that whosoever sinneth has
[40:44] not seen him neither known him or
[40:47] transgress the law remember John just
[40:50] laid it out the sin is the transgression
[40:52] of the law you have transgressed the law
[40:54] than you've sinned but the Bible says
[40:58] John said that whosoever abideth in
[41:02] Christ cannot sin sinneth not I'm how in
[41:06] the world can you have it both ways I
[41:08] can you be a sinner and not us and not
[41:11] sin how can you not send it be a sinner
[41:13] how can you live in Christ and not sin
[41:15] yet a disbeliever or have sin in your
[41:19] life I mean it can't be John it can't be
[41:21] both ladies I say this is one of those
[41:23] things that people get stuck in the
[41:25] gutter don't understand they avoid it
[41:27] because it doesn't make any common sense
[41:30] you can't teach it in an innocent in a
[41:33] seminary somewhere this has to come by
[41:36] revelation and has to come by revelation
[41:38] to me to you to those who are gods so
[41:41] that we can understand where we stand
[41:43] and who we are on this earth today you
[41:46] can't have it both ways so has it gonna
[41:47] be well listen because remember we
[41:50] already read about the new birth Peter
[41:52] talked about the new birth well what is
[41:56] abiding in him what does that mean we're
[41:59] for abiding in him that means we had a
[42:01] birth that means something else has
[42:04] taken place because when I was born I
[42:06] wasn't like that I was and I was born
[42:10] with the nature of Wrath I was born with
[42:13] a snake nature I wasn't born that way so
[42:15] something had to take place
[42:16] well John gets to it let's keep reading
[42:23] let's go back to the six verse whosoever
[42:25] abideth in him sinneth not whosoever
[42:29] sinneth has not seen him neither known
[42:31] him little children let no man deceive
[42:35] you good advice he that does
[42:37] righteousness is righteous even as
[42:42] is righteous those who do rightly those
[42:46] who are just remember what just is
[42:49] righteous ought to be condition
[42:52] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[42:55] now that's pretty hard but it's true
[42:58] especially after what John just told us
[43:03] what did John just tell us that we abide
[43:06] in him we cannot sin so when he said
[43:09] those he that committeth sin is of the
[43:11] devil he's saying that you still have
[43:14] that old nature you still are in that
[43:17] same condition that you're born in there
[43:21] has to be a new birth so if you haven't
[43:24] received a new birth if you're not
[43:26] abiding in him then you're a sinner you
[43:31] robbed the devil that's that's just the
[43:33] bottom line
[43:34] you belong to the devil until you give
[43:37] your heart to God and God comes in and
[43:39] lives in you then you become his and
[43:42] that's a very simplistic way of putting
[43:44] it that's God's approval of you by
[43:47] putting his spirit in you but if you
[43:49] haven't done that you're still in this
[43:50] snake nature you are of the devil that's
[43:54] just plain and simple you commit sin
[43:56] you're of the devil and of course we all
[43:59] were born unbelievers we all were born
[44:04] without the capacity at that time to to
[44:09] believe that's why again I had the
[44:11] little thing children go to heaven amen
[44:13] they may not go on the rapture but they
[44:15] all go into heaven because they yet have
[44:18] the capacity to do so but he that
[44:21] committeth sin is of the devil so so
[44:25] when we're born of this nature all of us
[44:28] sin your very desire came from your soul
[44:37] the scene of free will to sin the scene
[44:41] of free will caused you to sin that
[44:45] nature reflected in your spirit and then
[44:50] into your body because it came from your
[44:52] soul
[44:54] that's incoming from your soul free
[44:57] moral agent as a free will come from
[44:59] your soul to your spirit then to your
[45:02] body that that is who you were you were
[45:07] a sinner
[45:08] period now we're not as born-again sons
[45:13] and daughters of God we are not sinners
[45:16] although we're the only ones that can
[45:19] sin make a mistake
[45:21] it's like saying it's well I don't seen
[45:27] you think like it but let's just say how
[45:30] much how much of this Bible covers black
[45:33] well it's all black it's not a sinner
[45:37] it's just not it's not pretending to be
[45:40] black it's just black this is what it is
[45:42] sinners just do what they are they're
[45:45] not sitting there just living their
[45:46] lives they're just doing what they are
[45:48] the believers sins so we're not called
[45:50] sinners anymore
[45:52] because we're born in the seed of God so
[45:56] look now originally your sin come from
[46:00] your soldier nature your free will to
[46:02] sin to live it up to do whatever but
[46:06] look at the process he the committeth
[46:10] sin is of the devil for the devil
[46:12] sinneth from the beginning for this
[46:15] purpose for this purpose the sin the
[46:20] unbelief for this purpose the Son of God
[46:22] was manifested that he might destroy the
[46:27] works of the devil now what's the works
[46:29] of the devil
[46:30] now there's an S at the end of that what
[46:32] is those words what are the works of the
[46:35] devil
[46:36] well there's one work that I know of but
[46:39] let's go over to the Galatians real
[46:42] quick read these couple of verses of
[46:44] future Galatians chapter 5 let's begin
[46:49] with verse 19 it says now the works of
[46:52] the flesh are manifest works of the
[46:55] flesh or what are the works of the flesh
[46:58] the works of the flesh are the works of
[47:01] the devil because that's where the devil
[47:03] works remember even when you're born
[47:06] again even when you're filled with the
[47:08] Holy Spirit the only places that Satan
[47:11] can access is your body in your spirit
[47:14] because he can no longer access your
[47:16] soul so it's still these still parts of
[47:20] your body your body or your your being
[47:22] your body your spirit still access by
[47:24] the devil so the works of the flesh
[47:28] hence the works of the devil or manifest
[47:33] which are these adultery fornication
[47:36] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[47:39] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[47:44] wrath strife seditions heresies envyings
[47:49] murders drunkenness revellings and such
[47:52] like that's the work of the flesh now
[47:57] one in here like people I don't do this
[47:59] this this but how about that hatred part
[48:01] how much hatred do people have for other
[48:03] people
[48:04] how about hatred do you have for your
[48:06] enemy you better not hate your enemy you
[48:08] better love your enemy you better do
[48:10] good here enemy you better pray for them
[48:12] and if you love them unconditionally I
[48:14] don't see how they can be an enemy
[48:15] anyway but they might treat you as an
[48:17] enemy but you're not there that they're
[48:19] not your enemy because they're they're
[48:21] not that's your brother that's your
[48:24] sister when we identify the spirit and
[48:27] what happens in the spirit of what takes
[48:29] place in the spirit those are the that
[48:32] that is the works of the flesh so what
[48:35] John is saying here for this purpose is
[48:38] some of those manifest he might destroy
[48:39] the works of the devil so now if you're
[48:44] born again word of the works of the
[48:46] devil take place here the works of the
[48:49] flesh are right here in the body and
[48:51] even in the spirit because the spirit
[48:53] would try to bring things back up from
[48:55] your life or pervert your affection or
[48:57] try to bring back into memory things you
[48:59] used to live in your old life but and
[49:01] affect your body but but the body is the
[49:06] things that we look at is the works of
[49:08] the flesh are the works of the devil and
[49:10] Jesus Christ was man
[49:12] tested to destroy the works plural but
[49:15] what is that work what is it that brings
[49:18] each one of those attributes into being
[49:20] I believe you do those things because
[49:24] you don't believe you do those things
[49:26] because you have in your free will you
[49:29] still have the wrong nature and you
[49:31] desire your very desire is to do that is
[49:34] to live that way to be that kind of
[49:36] person and that's why you do it that's
[49:38] why people out here do it
[49:40] we judge people that we condemn people
[49:42] we do all these other things to people
[49:44] out of the world today it's hard to see
[49:47] things in in your mind and it hurts your
[49:49] hearts about this you you know they
[49:50] could be
[49:51] that's a soul that's where 10 million
[49:54] worlds that you'd like to reward to
[49:56] bring back to Jesus Christ but that's
[49:59] all based on God's predestination of God
[50:02] man as you go witness to that person
[50:03] whatever you do it but otherwise that's
[50:05] that that that's in God's hands that's
[50:07] up to God it hurts to see but we condemn
[50:09] it all but they're just doing what they
[50:11] are they condemn and look down on us as
[50:15] Christians as born-again sons and
[50:18] daughters of God they look down on us
[50:19] they think say all kinds of things
[50:22] against us but we can't help but do
[50:24] what's in us to do we just live who we
[50:27] are that's all we can do weren't God
[50:30] God's children were sons and daughters
[50:33] were born of the Spirit were led of his
[50:35] Spirit so we lived a life because that's
[50:37] what we are that's what we do Jesus was
[50:42] manifested he might destroy the works of
[50:44] the devil
[50:45] whosoever listen now ix first whosoever
[50:48] is born of God does not commit sin now
[50:54] up here in the what was it the six in
[51:02] the sixth verse he said whosoever
[51:05] abideth in him sin and not but now in
[51:08] the night first he said whoever is born
[51:11] of God does not commit sin so if you're
[51:14] born of God you do not commit sin for
[51:17] his seed his seed remaineth in him
[51:23] he cannot sin because he is born of God
[51:26] so what's John talking about what is it
[51:30] that God is accounting or not accounting
[51:33] to us what is it that we think well if I
[51:36] made a mistake or I've done something
[51:38] wrong or I'm transgressed God's work we
[51:40] go and apologize we repent and we ask
[51:42] God to forgive us you think oh well have
[51:45] I crossed over the line have I done it
[51:48] to where God won't forgive me anymore
[51:50] don't ever think like that because in
[51:53] the beginning your soul your free will
[51:57] dictated to you to sin it was your
[52:00] nature to want to sin but after you were
[52:02] born again the mistakes that we make the
[52:06] slip-ups the the the shortcomings come
[52:09] from here come from your body in their
[52:12] spirit you see cuz John is making a very
[52:15] stark difference between the sin that we
[52:18] had in the flesh the sin that we had
[52:21] when we were not born again the sin that
[52:23] people still live when they're not born
[52:26] again a stark contrast between those
[52:29] that are born again so what's John st.
[52:32] John saying over here that you can sin
[52:34] if you said you haven't sinned that
[52:36] you're you're a liar man over here he's
[52:39] saying that if you are born of God you
[52:41] cannot sin so so the balance of
[52:46] understanding what John is talking about
[52:48] is realizing one of without the new
[52:51] birth and the person with the new birth
[52:53] a person without the new birth sins from
[52:57] there because what is God concerned with
[52:59] what is what is it God's looking at he's
[53:03] looking at the soul he's looking at the
[53:05] innermost inside beam that's what he's
[53:08] concerned about that's what God looks
[53:10] for his Bloods got the blood ran around
[53:12] the earth that's taking care of the
[53:13] things in the body in the spirit we
[53:16] accept him that's done away with
[53:17] remember blessed is the man to whom God
[53:19] will not impute sin Romans 8:1 says
[53:24] there is therefore now you go read the
[53:27] end of chapter 7 and in chapter 8 verse
[53:30] 1 and see were the turmoil that John
[53:33] that Paul was heading
[53:35] between being born again and living in
[53:37] this flesh and still having the
[53:39] stickiness of this flesh he said the
[53:41] things I don't want to do if I'm myself
[53:43] doing the things I want to do is the
[53:45] things I don't do so what do I find he
[53:49] says when I do good evil is always
[53:51] present he always in himself explaining
[53:55] an understanding the battle that every
[53:58] one of us go through between the new
[54:01] birth and being born again and still
[54:03] making mistakes still doing still
[54:05] slipping up still sinning still things
[54:08] that we know we should do now when the
[54:10] Spirit of God come remember every man
[54:13] that had this hope in him purifies
[54:15] himself now there's the difference if
[54:19] you make a mistake here it's a mistake
[54:22] slip-up you caught the trap or something
[54:24] but it's not from the soul he's talking
[54:28] about a new birth a seed that seed that
[54:32] remaineth that's another reason that I
[54:34] believe it's it's this that it didn't
[54:37] just drop in there when you heard the
[54:38] word the seed that remains well if it
[54:41] remains that mean it was already there
[54:44] wolf is already there it stays there it
[54:47] just continues on that seed just
[54:50] eventually comes to life so when that
[54:53] seed remains there in him he can not see
[54:58] him why because he's born of God now
[55:02] does that make your flesh perfect no
[55:04] it's still in the process remember it
[55:08] still it's it's been potentially
[55:10] redeemed yes we're going on or in the
[55:14] process just like the air of this we're
[55:16] still in the process but the fullness of
[55:19] that redemption of the body's not going
[55:21] to happen till we get a body change
[55:23] going to rapture
[55:24] so yeah the stickiness of this flesh
[55:26] still happens there's still things that
[55:29] we do but you're no longer now now on
[55:32] the conversely now if you if you if in
[55:37] your soul you have a desire to just go
[55:40] light up the bars and
[55:42] and live that kind of life then that
[55:43] shows there hasn't been a change but if
[55:46] you make the mistake her slip-up or
[55:48] something to do something wrong and in
[55:49] your heart in your soul there's
[55:52] something there conviction says you know
[55:53] you should have done that you know that
[55:55] wasn't you make it right
[55:56] you make it right quickly that shows
[55:58] there's something in you the same that's
[56:00] not right you know it's not and then you
[56:03] do and then you move forward from there
[56:06] because that's been justified that's in
[56:10] God see if forgive when she never did
[56:11] that
[56:12] never existed you don't used to make the
[56:14] statement as as far as darkness is for
[56:16] light frame but that's wrong it's not
[56:18] even as far as darkness is from light
[56:20] because this doesn't exist at all it's
[56:22] not even in darkness because it's not
[56:24] there doesn't exist crazy in the mind of
[56:27] God doesn't exist no wonder you can't
[56:30] send no wonder blessed is the man whom
[56:32] God will not impute sin there is
[56:34] therefore now no condemnation do them
[56:38] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[56:40] after the flesh but after the spirit
[56:43] what's that spirit not to human spirits
[56:45] but the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit
[56:47] that now is the permanent resident of
[56:49] your soul we don't walk by the flesh we
[56:52] walk by the spirit that soul influences
[56:55] the spirit that spirit influence is the
[56:59] body and the times get the way but I
[57:01] wanted to read this to you here and now
[57:03] this isn't who is this Melchizedek
[57:07] February 1965 my man said he that he
[57:12] that's born of God does not commit sin
[57:15] and I actually didn't even read that
[57:17] quote that scripture in the tenth verse
[57:19] in this the new birth the children of
[57:23] God are manifest and the children of
[57:26] devil whosoever does not righteousness
[57:28] is not of God neither he that loveth not
[57:31] his brother
[57:32] Amen so in this the children of God are
[57:35] born cannot sin he that is born of God
[57:39] does not commit sin he can not sin again
[57:43] what's the operative word there birth
[57:47] born amen born of God new birth go back
[57:51] to Peter the new birth
[57:54] of incorruptible seed seed that
[57:58] remaineth their incorruptible seed a new
[58:00] birth even is born of God that not
[58:02] commit sin he cannot see in Romans 8:1
[58:05] there is therefore now no condemnation
[58:07] to them in Christ Jesus they walk not
[58:10] after the flesh but after the spirit
[58:11] there you are see that throws your body
[58:16] subject you don't have to say oh if I
[58:19] could just quit drinking if I could just
[58:21] quit smoking no just get into Christ and
[58:24] it's all gone it's like we're saying
[58:26] earlier you said well how do you know
[58:28] get it and you'll know that's that's
[58:32] easiest thing I'm going to tell you if
[58:34] people say well how do you know get it
[58:36] and you'll know if you don't know I
[58:37] doubt you have it because your body is
[58:41] subject to the spirit your body is
[58:44] subject to the spirit it is no more
[58:46] subject to the things of the world
[58:48] although it is influenced by the things
[58:50] of the world it's not subject to the
[58:52] things of the world to do the things of
[58:54] the world although it is influenced by
[58:57] the things of the world they are dead
[59:00] they are dead your sins are buried in
[59:02] Baptism and you are a new creature in
[59:04] Christ and your body is becoming subject
[59:08] to the spirit listen now this amen we're
[59:12] not we're not perfect beings
[59:14] jesus said be ye therefore perfect even
[59:16] as your father in heaven is perfect as a
[59:18] mature Christian amen
[59:20] even a mature Christian say that brother
[59:22] branham still made mistakes still did
[59:25] things wrong I bring up the example of
[59:28] him having his wife lied to the RS agent
[59:30] all the time it's a mistake God even
[59:33] called demony when he went to pray for
[59:34] the girl take your hands off that baby
[59:36] you're not fit to pray for her see had
[59:38] his own little girl say picked up the
[59:40] phone said daddy let me tell them
[59:42] they're not here you see doesn't mean
[59:45] your perfect sinless perfect but mature
[59:48] but even mature Christians in this
[59:50] sticky flesh make mistakes your body but
[59:54] your body is becoming subject to the
[59:57] spirit to try to live a right kind of
[1:00:01] life and there you go
[1:00:03] if there's not a desire to want to or
[1:00:07] try to live a right kind of life then I
[1:00:09] doubt very seriously you have the right
[1:00:10] kind of spirit I doubt very seriously
[1:00:12] you've been born again but if you have
[1:00:15] the desire to what to and you try to and
[1:00:19] you press forward into that not not just
[1:00:21] to say well you know I
[1:00:24] somebody tried and tried and couldn't
[1:00:27] get it well how did they try I mean I
[1:00:30] cried and prayed and went to the altar
[1:00:32] 100 times well if you went the first
[1:00:36] time you shouldn't have gone the second
[1:00:37] time I mean not not for that purpose
[1:00:40] anyway he's nothing wrong with going to
[1:00:41] an altar but the altars your heart if
[1:00:44] you've got em you trust God of gods
[1:00:46] clenched chin then he's done his part if
[1:00:50] there's a hiccup in there don't belong
[1:00:51] to God it belongs to you but but I'm
[1:00:54] saying that there's a desire there and
[1:00:56] God has taken control of that soul and
[1:00:59] and that desire of your soul now is to
[1:01:01] do what's right and to do the things you
[1:01:03] know godly in them by the scripture and
[1:01:06] that and that spirit is taking you and
[1:01:09] changing you and making you more into
[1:01:11] his image that we're growing into that
[1:01:13] see this body is getting to that place
[1:01:16] this body is coming to that place to
[1:01:19] where it will eventually get to the
[1:01:21] place to where just like it did with
[1:01:23] Enoch it was so much like God that God
[1:01:25] took him home we're going to get to the
[1:01:28] same place at the right time at the
[1:01:30] right place amen
[1:01:32] by faith God is bringing us to that
[1:01:35] place but you don't look at it based on
[1:01:38] the flesh based on the deception of the
[1:01:42] flesh you look at it based on the new
[1:01:45] birth and what God's done for you well
[1:01:49] we're going to continue to make mistakes
[1:01:50] and do things wrong but the closer we
[1:01:53] get to God the less of those we do the
[1:01:56] more we become like God the less of
[1:01:58] those things happen the more the more in
[1:02:01] His image we get through that new birth
[1:02:04] the new birth there's no sin you cannot
[1:02:08] sin we're here because this is
[1:02:12] you know always has been but we just
[1:02:15] come to the acknowledgement other than
[1:02:17] understanding of it this has always been
[1:02:19] us I always been me but we just come to
[1:02:22] that understanding but it throws all
[1:02:25] this into subjection then amen
[1:02:28] it brings us all into the place to say
[1:02:30] well I used to stand yeah well we used
[1:02:33] to sin because your desire was for the
[1:02:35] things of the world your soul commanded
[1:02:38] you your your nature commanded you to
[1:02:41] sin but when you were born again then
[1:02:43] the things of God take over then the
[1:02:45] only way that you sin you make mistake
[1:02:49] trip fall stumble is because of the body
[1:02:53] it's in the flesh
[1:02:55] those things are accounted to God that's
[1:02:57] already done that's already the blood of
[1:03:01] Jesus Christ covers that the Bible says
[1:03:04] he first he so loved the world that He
[1:03:06] gave His only begotten Son
[1:03:07] we loved the world where do we come from
[1:03:09] we came from the world we came from this
[1:03:12] earth we should say we came from this
[1:03:14] earth we did come from cause mom's we
[1:03:16] come from this this earth God so loved
[1:03:18] he gave His only begotten Son
[1:03:20] the who should I believe in him the NEM
[1:03:22] shall not perish but have everlasting
[1:03:23] like that that blood man is still there
[1:03:26] and that's that that's been taken care
[1:03:29] of God son that's not the concern the
[1:03:31] concern is in this soul we're not here
[1:03:35] to make church members we're not here to
[1:03:38] amplify some kind of a gift we're not
[1:03:41] here to try to get people to have big
[1:03:44] numbers we're here to be sons and
[1:03:47] daughters of God born again get people
[1:03:50] to Christ not just to justification not
[1:03:54] just to sanctification not just to a
[1:03:57] baptism or an anointing but through the
[1:04:00] indwelling presence of Christ in their
[1:04:02] life and that predestinated seed is
[1:04:05] there it remains there it's still there
[1:04:09] it stays there it just comes to life
[1:04:12] it's not a scene anymore and those that
[1:04:15] are mature Christian is just not a scene
[1:04:16] anymore
[1:04:17] it's now putting forth fruit it's a full
[1:04:19] grown tree if you will that's putting
[1:04:22] forth fruit
[1:04:23] that's living the life of godly life
[1:04:25] because that's the nature of the sea
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] do we make mistakes sure we do do we
[1:04:31] fall and get tripped up sure we do but
[1:04:34] the closer we get to God and the more we
[1:04:36] get like God the less of those things
[1:04:38] happen amen
[1:04:40] because we are sons and daughters of God
[1:04:43] I can go back real quick beloved now are
[1:04:49] we the sons of God now are we the sons
[1:04:53] of God and it's not something anything
[1:04:56] that I've done it's what he did and I
[1:04:58] just accepted it I just accepted and
[1:05:00] received it on on his behalf but he did
[1:05:03] it and he did it for us that we meet the
[1:05:06] children of God it leads us from that
[1:05:09] justification from the chicken yard the
[1:05:12] sanctification to the cleansing up to
[1:05:14] filling it amen to the filling it of the
[1:05:18] Holy Spirit doesn't do any good didn't
[1:05:21] just have water on the outside of the
[1:05:23] glass doesn't do any good just to anoint
[1:05:25] the glass on the outside that comes to
[1:05:27] the baptism matter that comes with the
[1:05:29] process of sanctification but when you
[1:05:31] fill it there's the difference that's
[1:05:34] when that glass is in operation now when
[1:05:37] it's being cleansed or it's under that
[1:05:39] anointing oh it can look and act just
[1:05:41] like the genuine just like the real but
[1:05:45] it won't and can't live that word word
[1:05:48] by word amen
[1:05:50] there's a difference in sinning making
[1:05:53] mistakes fall and willfully sinning a
[1:05:56] person who looks at and said well I
[1:05:58] don't care I'm gonna do it anyway well I
[1:05:59] doubt your desire has changed amen
[1:06:02] praise the Lord well god bless you again
