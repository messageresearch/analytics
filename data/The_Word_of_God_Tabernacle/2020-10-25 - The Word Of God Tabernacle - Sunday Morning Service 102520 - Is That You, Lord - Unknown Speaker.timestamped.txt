[50:58] reach the end of the service today but
[51:01] so thankful of god's word
[51:02] amen amen and the blessings of the lord
[51:05] in our life now
[51:06] genesis chapter 38 i'm going to read one
[51:08] verse and i'll let you be seated
[51:10] but let's go to the 2 38th chapter
[51:13] of genesis the 26th verse
[51:17] and we'll just read this one verse and
[51:19] i'll let you be seated
[51:22] and judah acknowledged them and said she
[51:24] hath been more righteous than i
[51:27] because that i gave her not to sheila my
[51:29] son
[51:30] and he knew her again no more you could
[51:34] be seated if you like
[51:35] it was kind of tough trying to find one
[51:38] single verse out of this that i want to
[51:40] read to you today to draw this text
[51:42] uh it was kind of tough to find one
[51:44] verse and it basically strange that
[51:45] that's the verse that i chose in the
[51:47] verse that i read
[51:49] you think what would you come up with
[51:51] out of this verse but
[51:52] i want to go back to the third ver to
[51:55] the sixth verse
[51:56] same 38th chapter sixth verse
[52:00] uh and and read this little story it's
[52:02] not a story it's actually
[52:04] happening sometimes you say a story a
[52:06] story is
[52:07] i consider a story something that's told
[52:09] by somebody not necessarily true
[52:11] but we know this is not fiction this is
[52:13] actually something that happened to
[52:15] human beings like we're standing on the
[52:16] earth today
[52:17] and then the sixth verse uh of course we
[52:20] go back to
[52:21] judah of course you know that jesus
[52:25] was in the lineage of judah and satan
[52:28] tried to
[52:29] snuff out the lineage of jesus by
[52:32] snuffing out the lineage of judah
[52:34] way back here in genesis 38 so i want to
[52:37] read this and i'll explain to you the
[52:39] text that i have today
[52:40] and when the lord gave it to me from
[52:42] there but let's begin at the sixth verse
[52:45] and let's just read this if you would if
[52:46] you have never read it
[52:48] uh it's uh it's quite an interesting
[52:50] story but a thought came to me
[52:52] uh actually probably several years ago
[52:54] that i wrote a note down
[52:57] on paper i think actually i was driving
[52:59] i think it was when i started
[53:00] doing uber and lyft and i was listening
[53:03] to a tape and
[53:05] something struck me about this story and
[53:06] i wrote down a little note and it's been
[53:08] in my
[53:09] notebook and the other day i guess the
[53:11] lord inspired me to go back and look at
[53:13] that and so this is where this came from
[53:15] but genesis 38 verse 6 and judah took
[53:19] a wife for ur his firstborn
[53:22] whose name was tamar and ur judah's
[53:25] firstborn was wicked in the sight of the
[53:28] lord
[53:28] and the lord slew him and judah said
[53:31] unto onan
[53:32] go in unto thy brother's wife and marry
[53:34] her and raise up
[53:36] sea to thy brother and onan knew that
[53:38] the seed should not be his
[53:41] and it came to pass when he went in unto
[53:43] his brother's wife that he spilled it
[53:45] on the ground lest that he should give
[53:48] seed to his brother
[53:50] and the young and the thing which he did
[53:52] displease the lord
[53:54] wherefore he slew him also
[53:58] then said judah to tomorrow's
[53:59] daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy
[54:01] father's house till sheila my son be
[54:04] grown
[54:05] for he said lest for adventure he die
[54:07] also as his brethren did and tamar went
[54:10] and dwelt in her father's house
[54:12] and in process of time the daughter of
[54:14] shuna judah's wife
[54:16] died and judah was comforted and went up
[54:18] into the
[54:19] sheepherders of tamnath he and his
[54:22] friend
[54:23] uh hira and uh the idolamite
[54:26] and it was told to march saying behold
[54:28] thy father-in-law
[54:30] goeth up to a timnath to shear his sheep
[54:33] and she went to her uh went and put on
[54:36] her
[54:37] she put her window garment off from her
[54:40] and covered her with a veil and wrapped
[54:43] herself
[54:43] and sat in an open place which is by the
[54:46] way of timnath
[54:48] for she saw that sheila was grown and
[54:50] she was not given unto him to wife
[54:53] when judah saw her he thought her to be
[54:56] a harlot because she had covered her
[54:57] face
[54:58] and he turned it unto her by the way and
[55:00] said go i pray thee
[55:02] let me come in unto thee for he knew not
[55:05] that she
[55:06] was his daughter-in-law and she said
[55:09] what will thou give me that thou mayest
[55:11] come in unto me
[55:12] and he said i will give thee a kid from
[55:15] the flock
[55:16] and she said what will thou give me a
[55:17] pledge till thou send it
[55:20] and he said what pledge shall i give
[55:22] thee she said thy signet
[55:24] thy bracelet and thy staff that is in
[55:26] thine hand
[55:27] and he gave it her and came in unto her
[55:30] and she conceived by him
[55:34] um let's just jump over
[55:38] to the 24th verse now just jump down to
[55:40] the 24th first
[55:45] and it came to pass about three months
[55:47] after that it was told
[55:48] judah saying tomorrow thy
[55:50] daughter-in-law had played the harlot
[55:52] and also behold she is with child by
[55:55] whoredom
[55:56] and judah said bring her forth and let
[55:59] her be
[56:00] burned when she was brought forth
[56:03] she sent to her father-in-law saying by
[56:05] by the man
[56:07] who these are am i the child
[56:10] am i with child and she was
[56:13] and she said discern i pray thee whose
[56:17] are these the signet and the bracelet
[56:19] and the staff
[56:20] and judah acknowledged them and said she
[56:23] had been more righteous than i because i
[56:25] gave her not to sheila
[56:26] my son and he knew her again no more
[56:30] that's a very interesting story that
[56:33] judah
[56:34] of course took had had his sons uh
[56:37] uh his three sons and uh he found earth
[56:41] his first son a wife which is custom of
[56:44] course
[56:44] and the wife he found for him was tamar
[56:47] and
[56:49] er was evil in the sight of god so god
[56:52] killed her and then he went in to own it
[56:55] and said onan which was custom take your
[56:58] brother's wife tomorrow
[57:00] and raise seed to thy brother and
[57:04] onan did not want his seed to be the
[57:06] seed of his brother
[57:08] selfish prideful whatever it is so he
[57:10] decided that he would just spill his
[57:12] seed on the ground instead of giving it
[57:14] to
[57:14] his brothers what he considered his
[57:16] brother's wife which actually at that
[57:18] time
[57:18] was his wife but was raising seed as the
[57:21] custom of their tradition
[57:23] unto his brother who had died right
[57:26] so that displeased the lord and god
[57:28] killed him
[57:29] also right so my thought today
[57:32] and the text i want to take is is that
[57:35] you
[57:36] lord is that you lord
[57:40] think about this because that's a it's a
[57:43] genuine question for any christian
[57:45] sure you know well because we all go
[57:47] through things in life
[57:48] right but it struck me because with the
[57:51] thought that came to me again i said
[57:53] several years ago the thought that came
[57:54] unto me is
[57:56] judah is blaming his daughter-in-law for
[57:59] his son's dying
[58:01] when god is killing his sons because of
[58:04] their wickedness it wasn't tomorrow that
[58:07] was killing
[58:08] his sons he was killing
[58:11] god was taking judah's sons before he
[58:14] could even
[58:15] raise children of tamar to continue the
[58:18] lineage of judah
[58:20] right satan of course the wicked
[58:23] one taking these children out causing
[58:26] them to be wicked
[58:27] causing them to act this way is the
[58:29] reason the lord took them
[58:31] but it was for a supernatural thing that
[58:33] god would continue this lineage
[58:35] but judah's mind and judah's thinking
[58:38] was
[58:38] that it's tamar's fault that his sons
[58:41] are dying
[58:42] is tamar's fault maybe she's barren
[58:44] maybe she's not able to bring
[58:46] children and her son his sons are dying
[58:48] before she can bring
[58:50] forth children to replace him so judah
[58:53] is blaming tamar for this
[58:55] when god is the one orchestrating this
[58:58] not tomorrow
[58:59] this isn't tomorrow doing this god is
[59:01] taking took er because he was evil
[59:04] god took odin because he was wicked and
[59:06] because of that
[59:07] judah's thinking that it's her fault
[59:10] of course in a lot of times when things
[59:12] go wrong in our lives
[59:13] a lot a lot of the time we think about
[59:15] well whose fault is this
[59:17] who did this who do we blame we always
[59:20] want to find a scapegoat we always want
[59:22] to find
[59:22] something or somebody to blame and
[59:24] sometimes it's nobody's fault
[59:26] not even the devil maybe you know the
[59:29] devil gets blamed for a lot of stuff it
[59:30] ain't his fault right right
[59:32] we just do things we shouldn't do right
[59:34] or say things or make decisions we
[59:36] shouldn't do it
[59:37] sometimes we get ourselves in those
[59:39] situations and those are our fault
[59:40] right not somebody else but again it's
[59:43] always to pass the buck like we talked
[59:45] about in garden of eden
[59:46] but judah in his mind he's blaming
[59:48] someone it's not her fault
[59:50] it's not tomorrow's fault so in judah's
[59:52] mind he's thinking okay well sheila's
[59:55] of age now but i'm not going to give him
[59:58] to her because he'll die too and i'll be
[1:00:00] childless
[1:00:01] i want to have any more kids i won't
[1:00:03] have anybody else to raise seed
[1:00:05] unto my generation so he's thinking i'm
[1:00:07] not going to give him to her
[1:00:08] and it was their custom it was their
[1:00:10] tradition it was their law
[1:00:12] basically that he was to give sheila to
[1:00:15] tamar to raise up seed to his brothers
[1:00:20] but he transgressed the law and did not
[1:00:23] give sheila to her
[1:00:25] and because he didn't give sheila to her
[1:00:27] she was upset about it because she knew
[1:00:29] the tradition
[1:00:30] so somebody told her now in the meantime
[1:00:33] judah's wife
[1:00:34] dies and of course judah is lonely
[1:00:38] and so he goes into this city he sees a
[1:00:40] harlot so he wants to go into this
[1:00:42] harlot
[1:00:42] uh he's a lonely man so he wants to go
[1:00:44] into this harlot and
[1:00:46] of course it wasn't obviously then like
[1:00:48] it is today
[1:00:49] so um uh that uh so he goes in unto her
[1:00:53] she took off her widow's clothes and put
[1:00:55] on the widow the garments of a harlot
[1:00:57] and hit her face and
[1:00:58] he didn't know it was her right so he
[1:01:00] goes in unto
[1:01:01] her and he has his time and they uh uh
[1:01:05] come together and she conceives by judah
[1:01:08] right by that conception of her
[1:01:12] of his daughter-in-law she conceived
[1:01:15] judah's seed to continue the lineage of
[1:01:17] jesus christ
[1:01:18] now of course in the end it is tomorrow
[1:01:22] has twins
[1:01:23] and one of those twins of course
[1:01:24] continues you can read over in matthew
[1:01:26] the lineage of jesus christ one of those
[1:01:29] twins continues on with the lineage of
[1:01:31] jesus christ from the seed of judah
[1:01:34] because you know jesus is the lion of
[1:01:37] the tribe of
[1:01:38] judah right so it's that lineage that
[1:01:41] had to continue on
[1:01:42] so that that seed had to be planted in
[1:01:45] this righteous woman
[1:01:47] who judah had blamed for for his son's
[1:01:49] death
[1:01:50] but he didn't realize it was god doing
[1:01:52] it right how many times do things happen
[1:01:55] in our lives and we don't recognize this
[1:01:57] is you lord
[1:01:58] job said uh i i see him in the whirlwind
[1:02:01] i hear him in the
[1:02:03] in the fire and the thunder and the
[1:02:04] cracking and all the things that's going
[1:02:06] on but he passes by me just like a
[1:02:09] just like a a still small voice and i
[1:02:11] recognize him not
[1:02:13] right i don't see him god always has his
[1:02:17] hand in our life friend right
[1:02:18] we don't always recognize that it's him
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:21] but the question then becomes well is
[1:02:23] that you lord
[1:02:25] is that you i mean that would have been
[1:02:27] a great question for judah house before
[1:02:29] he just lays blame on tomorrow
[1:02:31] for his son's dying well lord is this
[1:02:33] you are you
[1:02:34] doing this is this your work are you the
[1:02:38] one
[1:02:38] uh bringing this to pass the way it is
[1:02:40] should i do this
[1:02:42] and and give sheila to tamar because
[1:02:44] that's what he should have done
[1:02:46] so once she is found with child
[1:02:49] the people come back to judah and said
[1:02:51] your daughter-in-law who you didn't give
[1:02:53] to sheila has now played the part of a
[1:02:56] and she's pregnant she's got a child
[1:02:59] and and judah says well let her be
[1:03:01] burned then
[1:03:03] and it's his child in her womb the chill
[1:03:06] turned out to be children
[1:03:07] but his child and her won but he didn't
[1:03:10] even know it
[1:03:12] and he said let her be burned she's done
[1:03:14] this she's played this part
[1:03:16] let her be burned and he was the one
[1:03:18] that refused to give sheila to her
[1:03:20] it was his fault that it happened that
[1:03:23] way it was from the beginning
[1:03:25] that's why when it comes here judah
[1:03:27] acknowledged
[1:03:28] that that that that signet and that
[1:03:30] staff and all was his
[1:03:32] right and he said oh my this is the
[1:03:35] this is what i gave to the woman that i
[1:03:38] went to bed with
[1:03:39] these are mine he acknowledged them he
[1:03:42] said yes these belong to me and this
[1:03:44] woman is more righteous than i am
[1:03:46] because i refused to give sheila to her
[1:03:48] i
[1:03:49] transgressed our tradition and law by
[1:03:51] not giving him to her
[1:03:53] right i'm the one that fought here i'm
[1:03:55] the one that made the mistake
[1:03:57] i'm the one that made the wrong type
[1:03:59] judgment i said this is god this
[1:04:01] uh this is uh a her that's causing this
[1:04:04] but it wasn't
[1:04:05] god was the one orchestrating this
[1:04:07] friend yes we have to remember
[1:04:10] we have to as children of god continue
[1:04:13] to realize
[1:04:14] that god is working everything
[1:04:18] not just every other thing or whatever
[1:04:21] he wants to
[1:04:22] he's working everything together for
[1:04:25] his perfect will and for our good
[1:04:29] amen which are the same right right
[1:04:32] what is good for us is what is god's
[1:04:35] perfect will
[1:04:36] and what is god's perfect will is what
[1:04:39] is
[1:04:40] good for us and he's working everything
[1:04:44] for our good he's working everything to
[1:04:46] fit his perfect will
[1:04:48] and those two things are the same right
[1:04:51] those two
[1:04:51] uh endings they're exactly the same
[1:04:54] objective that god's bringing them to
[1:04:56] both of them amen judah assumed it was
[1:05:00] tomorrow's fault it wasn't tomorrow's
[1:05:02] fault
[1:05:03] it wasn't her doing this right it was
[1:05:05] his children
[1:05:06] right now a couple of scriptures we'll
[1:05:08] go to romans chapter 11.
[1:05:12] romans chapter 11 verse 33
[1:05:17] i want to read through this or try to
[1:05:19] get through this the lord help me
[1:05:21] i got a story i want to read to you for
[1:05:23] the message
[1:05:25] here at the end of it it's a little
[1:05:26] lengthy so just bear with me but
[1:05:28] i want to get to the place that we don't
[1:05:30] keep you too long but i want to get that
[1:05:32] story read too before we uh
[1:05:34] before we go now romans uh yeah romans
[1:05:37] chapter 11 verse 33
[1:05:40] look now paul speaking of course of the
[1:05:42] romans oh
[1:05:43] the depth of the riches both of the
[1:05:46] wisdom and knowledge of god
[1:05:48] now who can acknowledge that amen amen
[1:05:51] how unsearchable are his judgments
[1:05:55] and his ways past finding out
[1:05:59] his ways are beyond our ways right his
[1:06:02] faults are beyond our thoughts
[1:06:05] his judgments are unsearchable
[1:06:09] his ways past finding out how many
[1:06:12] things happen
[1:06:13] how many things are going on today i
[1:06:15] can't tell you
[1:06:19] i i guess if i sit down i probably could
[1:06:21] but i at this moment standing here i
[1:06:23] can't tell you how many times people
[1:06:25] have called me or text me
[1:06:26] questioning not understanding what's
[1:06:28] going on with the coven thing
[1:06:30] right i said don't worry about that
[1:06:33] uh well why did so-and-so get it i don't
[1:06:36] know
[1:06:37] well why did so-and-so die from it i
[1:06:39] don't know
[1:06:41] i just know that as a child of god you
[1:06:43] have to trust god is working it all for
[1:06:45] his glory
[1:06:46] for his honor and for our good right
[1:06:48] whatever it does
[1:06:50] right yes that's all i can tell you
[1:06:53] i i don't know and yeah it can become
[1:06:55] confusing
[1:06:56] to say well why this and why that and
[1:07:00] we are a people especially in the day
[1:07:03] that we live
[1:07:03] and the society has caused us all to uh
[1:07:06] to be more
[1:07:07] active in the laodicea spirit which is
[1:07:10] my rights and me and all about me and
[1:07:13] and and all that you know which actually
[1:07:15] if you're a child of god you're a sheep
[1:07:17] and you have no rights you've
[1:07:18] relinquished your rights to the shepherd
[1:07:21] and we are just sheep that follow the
[1:07:23] shepherd we are led by his spirit
[1:07:26] we do what he tells us his thoughts we
[1:07:28] want his thoughts to be our thoughts
[1:07:30] right we want his ways to be our ways
[1:07:33] well if his thoughts are my thoughts and
[1:07:34] my thoughts go inside
[1:07:36] if he waits are my ways and my ways go
[1:07:38] to the side i don't want my way i want
[1:07:40] his way amen
[1:07:42] and see everybody well why did this
[1:07:44] happen why did that happen and we
[1:07:45] we continue with that why question but
[1:07:48] we don't know why
[1:07:50] you might not ever know why right and
[1:07:52] why is
[1:07:53] it it will be a proverbial question uh
[1:07:56] in humans minds throughout as long as
[1:07:58] there is history
[1:08:00] but the fact remains that god is working
[1:08:04] all this together and the question can
[1:08:07] be
[1:08:07] lord then is that you are you the one
[1:08:10] doing this
[1:08:12] are you the one causing this to happen
[1:08:14] are you the one bringing this to pass
[1:08:16] is this your will is this what you want
[1:08:18] from me right now
[1:08:19] is this where you put me is this why
[1:08:22] i've done this
[1:08:23] right and people don't understand well i
[1:08:25] just can't see why
[1:08:27] well don't worry about why just say lord
[1:08:30] if it's your will then
[1:08:31] let it be amen but we we pray
[1:08:35] we bring prayer requests we trust the
[1:08:37] lord it was a lot of prayer requests
[1:08:39] today a lot of needs
[1:08:40] a lot of situations sick people and and
[1:08:43] and and things happening but but we
[1:08:45] trust and believe that
[1:08:47] there's a reason god does that amen and
[1:08:49] it's all for his glory and honor and we
[1:08:51] want it to be
[1:08:52] nothing to us but all to him it's all to
[1:08:55] his glory and honor
[1:08:56] but his ways his judgments are
[1:08:59] unsearchable
[1:09:01] well god judged that this is to be that
[1:09:03] way well i don't want it to be that way
[1:09:05] well then you're not a christian
[1:09:08] i don't want it to be like that well
[1:09:12] paul even said the things that happened
[1:09:14] to us are grievous at the time
[1:09:16] they're hard to understand and and just
[1:09:19] like he told here
[1:09:20] it's beyond our knowing his ways are
[1:09:23] past us even finding out amen
[1:09:27] it's above all that we could ever ask or
[1:09:30] what
[1:09:31] think there's things that he does for us
[1:09:34] that's succeeding
[1:09:36] abundant above anything that we can even
[1:09:39] think right well if we can't even
[1:09:42] think that high then how could we even
[1:09:45] begin to fathom that we can
[1:09:46] that we can understand the mind of god
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] you just can't do it god's working the
[1:09:53] work in judah's life because god wants
[1:09:55] to bring about
[1:09:56] a righteous ending or continuing of the
[1:09:59] lineage of jesus christ
[1:10:01] and it wasn't going to come through a
[1:10:03] wicked er or a wicked odon
[1:10:05] right that's why god had judah come into
[1:10:08] tamar
[1:10:09] and skip that generation to bring in
[1:10:11] that lint to continue that lineage
[1:10:14] and he used tamar to do it that's why
[1:10:16] judah said she's more righteous than i
[1:10:18] am right not realizing
[1:10:22] but the knowledge of god the wisdom and
[1:10:24] knowledge of god how unsearchable are
[1:10:26] his judgments
[1:10:28] his ways past finding out
[1:10:31] for who had known the mind of the lord
[1:10:34] or who had been his counselor
[1:10:36] right a lot of people sure think they
[1:10:38] are right a lot of people act like they
[1:10:40] want to be
[1:10:41] but nobody comes close to even emulating
[1:10:45] what jesus does must let's be his
[1:10:47] counselor
[1:10:49] or who has first given to him and it
[1:10:52] shall be recompensed unto him again
[1:10:55] for of him and through him and to him
[1:10:58] are
[1:10:58] all things to whom be glory forever
[1:11:01] amen amen so it comes to the point
[1:11:04] saints that we realize
[1:11:06] god is if we're christians if we're
[1:11:08] children of god
[1:11:09] that god is working this together for
[1:11:11] our good right yes
[1:11:13] however he's doing it i may not
[1:11:15] understand it
[1:11:16] it may not make any sense may not have
[1:11:18] been the way i would do it in fact it
[1:11:20] probably wouldn't have been
[1:11:21] most of the thing the things the lord's
[1:11:23] done in my life most of the time it's
[1:11:24] been as the lord wanted
[1:11:26] i wouldn't have done it like that right
[1:11:28] but he does it that way for a reason he
[1:11:30] brings it about that way for a reason
[1:11:32] why did god send moses down to egypt
[1:11:35] and then harden the pharaohs hard
[1:11:37] against him
[1:11:39] i mean you think about god you're
[1:11:41] sending me someplace so he's going to
[1:11:43] lay out the red carpet
[1:11:44] he's going to throw the beautiful roses
[1:11:46] and flowers and
[1:11:47] and the trumpets are going to blow and
[1:11:49] the banners are going to wave and
[1:11:51] i'm going to get the welcome of my life
[1:11:54] yeah you're gonna get the welcome of
[1:11:55] your life all right
[1:11:56] that ain't gonna be the way you think
[1:11:58] right amen
[1:12:01] no red carpet no flowers no banners no
[1:12:04] trumpets
[1:12:04] no sound of salute it's all about
[1:12:08] hardness he hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:12:12] against him
[1:12:13] and every and most of the time our
[1:12:15] thoughts are oh wow
[1:12:16] god asked me to do this this is just
[1:12:18] going to be a breeze
[1:12:20] don't you think for a second that god
[1:12:23] won't allow
[1:12:24] the devil to come and trip you on every
[1:12:27] single
[1:12:28] chance he gets right god wants to test
[1:12:31] and make sure that we know
[1:12:33] god this is you right you did this
[1:12:36] you sent me here you called me to do
[1:12:38] this you're the one who orchestrated
[1:12:40] this
[1:12:41] you're the one who moved in my life you
[1:12:42] spoke to me and told me
[1:12:45] whether you believe it or not am i well
[1:12:47] it must not have been the lord or it
[1:12:48] wouldn't have been all this upset
[1:12:50] you know if there's a lot of upset that
[1:12:51] probably means it's god
[1:12:54] amen amen that probably means
[1:12:57] more the best evidence that it probably
[1:13:00] is god
[1:13:00] amen because the devil's going to fight
[1:13:02] at every chance but remember
[1:13:04] when god when moses went to egypt the
[1:13:07] bible says
[1:13:08] god hardened pharaoh's heart against him
[1:13:11] god did that my
[1:13:14] and then along the line pharaoh's heart
[1:13:17] would get softened and then
[1:13:18] god would just harden it right back up
[1:13:20] again pharaoh's heart would get softened
[1:13:22] and his people would come and scream and
[1:13:23] yell
[1:13:24] and he'd say oh okay you couldn't and
[1:13:26] god would just harden it right back up
[1:13:27] again
[1:13:27] right amen hard to understand but look
[1:13:31] how god
[1:13:32] we in retrospect we can look back
[1:13:35] hindsight's 20 20 right we can always
[1:13:37] look back and say well
[1:13:38] we can see how this worked and how god
[1:13:41] orchestrated it
[1:13:42] but when you're in the middle of it
[1:13:44] friend it doesn't look like that amen
[1:13:46] it doesn't feel like that it doesn't
[1:13:48] seem that this
[1:13:49] is gonna be what god's gonna work to be
[1:13:52] his glory and honor
[1:13:53] and that all of us are gonna benefit
[1:13:55] from it it doesn't look that way
[1:13:58] because his ways are way beyond us
[1:14:00] finding out
[1:14:01] his ways are far beyond what we can
[1:14:03] comprehend
[1:14:04] yes the the way god does things
[1:14:08] transcends things that we could even
[1:14:10] think
[1:14:12] how many times has god's done something
[1:14:14] in your life in
[1:14:16] in retrospect you look back
[1:14:19] and you believe and understand that was
[1:14:21] the hand of god
[1:14:22] but you realize at the time or you think
[1:14:25] back at the time
[1:14:26] you didn't know that was god right you
[1:14:28] didn't realize that was the hand of the
[1:14:30] lord doing that
[1:14:31] yes you didn't understand this was god's
[1:14:33] moving in your life and bringing this to
[1:14:35] passing this to passing this to pass
[1:14:37] and you may not have understood and we
[1:14:39] don't understand a lot of times
[1:14:41] the consequences we suffer from things
[1:14:44] that we do that we're not supposed to do
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:48] that happens too amen these consequences
[1:14:51] sometimes that are there that we don't
[1:14:53] realize that that that's god too
[1:14:55] right because god is making that work
[1:14:58] together for our good
[1:14:59] it's like a a parent and a child when a
[1:15:02] child does something or transgress the
[1:15:04] parents
[1:15:05] instructions then that child has to
[1:15:07] suffer the consequences
[1:15:09] right amen the child might administer it
[1:15:12] uh the
[1:15:12] the parent might administer it or it
[1:15:14] might just become a result
[1:15:16] of what their life is now like now you
[1:15:19] look at parent neglect today
[1:15:21] i don't know why we ended up getting on
[1:15:22] children parents last week too
[1:15:24] you look at parents today and you look
[1:15:27] at children and you think
[1:15:28] well if there's parent neglect which
[1:15:31] brother branham talked about today it's
[1:15:32] not
[1:15:33] child delinquency it's parent
[1:15:34] delinquency you look at parent
[1:15:36] delinquency today and you can see how
[1:15:39] people are are out in the world today
[1:15:42] and you think
[1:15:43] wonder what kind of home they came from
[1:15:45] right
[1:15:46] wonder what caused them to be like that
[1:15:49] they probably transgressed along the
[1:15:51] line and there was no repercussion
[1:15:54] there was no punishment right they'd
[1:15:56] done something wrong with no punishment
[1:15:59] well if you do something wrong with no
[1:16:00] punishment you think oh i got away with
[1:16:02] it
[1:16:02] what you do something worse the next
[1:16:05] time
[1:16:06] right right and if you get away with it
[1:16:07] if the parent doesn't take care of it
[1:16:10] and doesn't handle it when they're
[1:16:11] children then they grow up to be
[1:16:13] reprobates
[1:16:14] right the end of killing people robbing
[1:16:17] jail whatever right and that's what
[1:16:20] happens
[1:16:20] parent delinquency that's where it is
[1:16:23] where it is today brother branham said
[1:16:25] that 40 years ago
[1:16:26] apparent delinquency let's go to isaiah
[1:16:28] chapter 55.
[1:16:33] isaiah chapter 55
[1:16:44] as soon as you get away from god and get
[1:16:47] away from everything that's right
[1:16:50] you get rid of everything that works
[1:16:52] properly
[1:16:53] doesn't look like it at the time but you
[1:16:55] see the fruits of that that manifests
[1:16:58] itself later down the line
[1:17:00] and the fruits that manifest itself
[1:17:02] sometimes is a worse
[1:17:03] punishment than if god had just whooped
[1:17:05] this one good time
[1:17:07] what happened you know or just like a
[1:17:10] parent
[1:17:11] you think the punishment down the line
[1:17:13] of what the results are
[1:17:15] are far worse if you just spank that
[1:17:17] child to start with
[1:17:18] right yes now i'm not you know some
[1:17:21] people uh
[1:17:22] beat their kids i don't agree with that
[1:17:23] either but i do agree with the bible and
[1:17:25] the rod and the respect and
[1:17:27] and displaying children that's just the
[1:17:29] way we raise our children
[1:17:31] we believe the bible says right with
[1:17:34] love and respect you've got to remember
[1:17:36] yes uh one thing billy paul i heard in
[1:17:38] his testimony years ago
[1:17:41] he said that his his little boy come
[1:17:44] around
[1:17:45] and interrupted him and brother branham
[1:17:47] and he said
[1:17:48] go off and play and they told him two or
[1:17:50] three times he came two or three times
[1:17:52] and
[1:17:52] and about the third or fourth time billy
[1:17:54] paul got so mad at his son he just
[1:17:55] whacked him on the bottom one time scoot
[1:17:57] him a couple foot across the floor
[1:17:59] and he went off crying and he said okay
[1:18:02] daddy let's get back and brother brown
[1:18:03] says
[1:18:04] no he said well what's the matter
[1:18:08] he said you just struck that child he
[1:18:09] says you're just you're telling me i
[1:18:12] just disciplined my child he said no you
[1:18:14] struck that child in anger
[1:18:15] right he said and that angel is
[1:18:18] displeased with what you did but
[1:18:20] you strike him in anger you beat him
[1:18:22] let's just say it that way
[1:18:23] you struck him in anger you're not to
[1:18:26] strike him in anger correction's a
[1:18:27] different thing
[1:18:28] right he had to make that right right
[1:18:30] then and there
[1:18:32] you know i i guess it was fun living
[1:18:34] with your daddy as a prophet right
[1:18:36] but anyway he said he had to make that
[1:18:39] right right then
[1:18:40] you know because he displeased the lord
[1:18:42] when he did that he displeased that
[1:18:44] angel he displeased that
[1:18:45] displeased the lord he said and he had
[1:18:47] to make it right
[1:18:48] he had to get before they could continue
[1:18:50] on with their correspondence and their
[1:18:52] writing back
[1:18:52] he had to make that right because they
[1:18:54] had to get the atmosphere back right
[1:18:55] again
[1:18:56] right amen right isaiah 55
[1:19:01] verse 6 seek ye the lord while he may be
[1:19:05] found
[1:19:06] call ye upon him while he is near let
[1:19:09] the wicked forsake his way and the
[1:19:11] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:19:13] return
[1:19:14] unto the lord and he will have mercy
[1:19:16] upon him
[1:19:17] and to our god and he will
[1:19:20] abundantly pardon praise the lord that's
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] god of mercy for my thoughts are not
[1:19:27] your thoughts
[1:19:28] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:19:30] lord
[1:19:31] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:19:33] earth so are my ways
[1:19:36] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:19:38] than your thoughts
[1:19:39] we know the song oh i can remember i
[1:19:42] could hear
[1:19:44] of course brother branham said it many
[1:19:45] times but of course more recently i can
[1:19:47] hear brother green rings in my mind
[1:19:50] the lord works in mysterious ways his
[1:19:52] wonders to perform
[1:19:54] and uh that that's a 300 year old song
[1:19:58] but it's still true today amen
[1:20:00] the lord does work in mysterious ways
[1:20:02] his wonder to perform what is that
[1:20:04] mysterious ways
[1:20:05] well we can go and look especially in
[1:20:07] the new testament at all the references
[1:20:10] to
[1:20:10] mysteries and things hidden from covered
[1:20:13] up from generations and ages
[1:20:16] god continually unfolding himself first
[1:20:19] was a mystery and then
[1:20:21] revealed it continues to remain a
[1:20:23] mystery
[1:20:24] unless god does reveal it but he does
[1:20:26] work
[1:20:27] in mysterious ways what is a mystery
[1:20:29] something you don't know or understand
[1:20:31] right
[1:20:32] we may not know it or understand it his
[1:20:34] ways his faults are not our thoughts his
[1:20:37] ways are not our ways
[1:20:39] god said that heavens are higher than
[1:20:42] the earth so my ways are higher than
[1:20:43] your ways my thoughts and your thoughts
[1:20:46] that's why philippians says let the mind
[1:20:49] of christ be in you
[1:20:50] right amen let that mind that was in
[1:20:53] christ be in you
[1:20:54] amen so that we can understand and see
[1:20:57] through the word
[1:20:58] how how to live our lives how to be
[1:21:02] pleasing to the lord
[1:21:03] right i think i told you one time i had
[1:21:05] a guy in the car and
[1:21:06] uh he claimed to be a christian but he
[1:21:09] was very smart kid so he's
[1:21:11] you know kind of he followed god with
[1:21:13] his intellect
[1:21:15] and we were talking about being pleasing
[1:21:18] to god and that kind of thing i forget
[1:21:19] exactly how it got to that point and i
[1:21:21] said well how do you know
[1:21:23] how to please the lord well i just do
[1:21:25] whatever you know
[1:21:26] i think that that is right i said well
[1:21:29] how do you know what is right
[1:21:31] he said well the things that are
[1:21:32] socially normal i said how do you know
[1:21:34] the social
[1:21:35] is is right how do you know that our
[1:21:37] society is right
[1:21:39] how do you know that what society is
[1:21:41] doing and living and how they go
[1:21:43] how do you know that any of that is
[1:21:44] right and he got to the place he just
[1:21:46] couldn't answer me and i said the only
[1:21:48] way we can know is through god's holy
[1:21:50] word
[1:21:51] through the bible the bible's the only
[1:21:53] way we can know what is pleasing to god
[1:21:56] we don't do what is pleasing to god by
[1:21:58] doing what we
[1:21:59] think is right we do what the word says
[1:22:02] is right we do what the word tells us is
[1:22:05] right if we live by the dictates of this
[1:22:07] scripture
[1:22:08] then we will be pleasing to the lord
[1:22:10] that's the bottom line of it
[1:22:12] he is because his ways are higher than
[1:22:14] our ways his thoughts higher than our
[1:22:16] thoughts
[1:22:17] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:22:20] from heaven returneth not thither but
[1:22:22] water at the earth and make it that
[1:22:23] bring
[1:22:24] forth and bud that it may give seed to
[1:22:26] the sower and bread to the eater
[1:22:29] so shall my word be to be that goeth
[1:22:32] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:22:34] return unto me void
[1:22:36] it shall accomplish that which i please
[1:22:38] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:22:40] unto i
[1:22:41] sent it amen praise the lord amen the
[1:22:44] word of the lord comes out
[1:22:46] is going to return the way that god sent
[1:22:49] it for the purpose that god meant for it
[1:22:52] to
[1:22:53] to cause and to bring about is going to
[1:22:55] happen
[1:22:57] satan no matter how hard he tries to
[1:22:59] stop it he can't do it
[1:23:01] right because the word of the lord says
[1:23:03] as he speaks it it will
[1:23:06] perform itself amen that word will not
[1:23:08] return void
[1:23:10] it will accomplish what he sent it forth
[1:23:12] for so if that word
[1:23:14] comes through god's bible if that word
[1:23:17] comes through your lips
[1:23:18] if it's god speaking he will accomplish
[1:23:21] what he said he would do
[1:23:23] period there's not enough devils in hell
[1:23:27] can stop it
[1:23:28] amen it will accomplish what god said it
[1:23:30] would
[1:23:32] for you shall go out with joy and be led
[1:23:36] forth with peace
[1:23:37] the mountains the hills shall break
[1:23:38] forth before you into
[1:23:40] singing hallelujah all the trees of the
[1:23:43] field shall clap their hands
[1:23:45] instead of the thorn instead of the
[1:23:47] thorns shall come up
[1:23:48] the fir tree and instead of the briar
[1:23:50] shall come up the myrtle tree
[1:23:52] and it shall be the lord for a name for
[1:23:55] an everlasting sign that shall not be
[1:23:57] cut off
[1:23:58] amen praise the lord what is that that
[1:24:01] means that when god does it when you ask
[1:24:03] for a
[1:24:04] a bread he doesn't give you a stone
[1:24:07] right
[1:24:07] amen right when you when you speak
[1:24:10] something and the word goes forth
[1:24:12] it accomplishes that when go you desire
[1:24:15] something
[1:24:16] from the lord the lord doesn't just send
[1:24:17] you down and give you something that's
[1:24:20] uh that that's you won't want to uh
[1:24:22] something nice and god gives you a
[1:24:25] thorn or a briar right he sends forth
[1:24:28] that that's beautiful that that's
[1:24:29] pleasant amen that is going to
[1:24:31] prosper and prosper you amen
[1:24:34] and that's why we should say sometimes
[1:24:36] is that your lord
[1:24:37] are you working that is this you
[1:24:40] doing this yes is this you causing this
[1:24:43] to be
[1:24:44] to happen the way it is and i'm talking
[1:24:46] about specific things
[1:24:48] i'm talking about very specific things
[1:24:50] sometimes just like judah
[1:24:52] with his sons dying did he just took a
[1:24:55] moment and said lord is this you
[1:24:57] god might have spoke to him and said yes
[1:25:00] your sons are evil
[1:25:02] and she would give sheila to tomorrow
[1:25:05] but
[1:25:05] god's working it all yes because
[1:25:09] the other thing we have to understand
[1:25:11] that god know what god knew what judah's
[1:25:13] reaction was going to be
[1:25:15] god knew what judah was going to think
[1:25:16] god knew what judah was going to do
[1:25:18] right he knows what you're going to
[1:25:20] think he knows what you are going to do
[1:25:23] that's why he orchestrates it and turns
[1:25:25] it around and makes it work to where
[1:25:26] it's going to work out right
[1:25:28] because we can come and say well this is
[1:25:30] supposed to be like this and somebody
[1:25:32] come and say no
[1:25:33] it's not going to be like that well you
[1:25:34] know god's got another plan for that to
[1:25:36] happen the way he wants it to
[1:25:38] because god has an end result and the
[1:25:41] end result is what god's looking for
[1:25:43] not the middle the middle of the road is
[1:25:45] just a facilitator
[1:25:47] god's looking for the end result god
[1:25:49] starts here and he's looking for this to
[1:25:51] happen
[1:25:52] and whatever god does in between here is
[1:25:54] up to him
[1:25:55] man can try to stop what god's trying to
[1:25:57] do but god's going to continually move
[1:26:00] on
[1:26:00] with his plan and it's going to have the
[1:26:03] result that god
[1:26:04] intended it to have period no matter
[1:26:07] what the devil can do no matter how long
[1:26:09] he can hold back
[1:26:10] prayers like he like daniel
[1:26:13] amen the angel come to daniel said that
[1:26:15] those those demonic spirits have been
[1:26:17] hindering us from 21 days to get to you
[1:26:20] dan you know he said that's okay right
[1:26:22] god took care of me yes god heard my
[1:26:25] prayer
[1:26:26] i knew god heard my prayer but you
[1:26:28] didn't hear from him but i knew he heard
[1:26:29] me
[1:26:30] great amen but i didn't hear his voice i
[1:26:32] didn't feel his spirit but i knew he
[1:26:34] heard me amen
[1:26:36] you got to know it's faith amen god
[1:26:38] hears us
[1:26:39] amen god understands amen
[1:26:43] god understands let's look back at
[1:26:46] another couple of situations here
[1:26:48] let's go to matthew chapter 1.
[1:26:54] matthew chapter 1
[1:26:59] a very prominent situation that took
[1:27:02] place
[1:27:04] and how would you react now this one
[1:27:07] came forth in a different way
[1:27:11] but same situation when it first
[1:27:13] unfolded
[1:27:16] matthew chapter one verse uh
[1:27:19] see verse 18. now the birth of jesus
[1:27:22] christ
[1:27:23] christ was on this wise when as his
[1:27:25] mother mary was espoused to joseph
[1:27:28] before they came together
[1:27:29] she was found with child of the holy
[1:27:31] ghost now
[1:27:33] we read the bible today and the bible
[1:27:36] tells us
[1:27:37] that mary was pregnant of the holy ghost
[1:27:41] we can see that well he said well praise
[1:27:43] the lord that's the deliverer amen
[1:27:46] we believe that but if you're standing
[1:27:49] there
[1:27:49] at that time when that event is
[1:27:51] unfolding what do you think
[1:27:54] oh my she's pregnant already
[1:27:58] her and joseph hadn't even come together
[1:28:00] it'd be like tomorrow
[1:28:02] it'd be like jo judah's uh accusation to
[1:28:05] tomorrow was she
[1:28:06] she played the part of a harlot she's
[1:28:09] she's pregnant she hadn't even come to
[1:28:10] her husband yet
[1:28:11] they're already betrothed and she's
[1:28:15] pregnant
[1:28:16] when you're sitting there and you're a
[1:28:18] part of the event that's happening
[1:28:20] this is real life right when you're
[1:28:22] sitting here
[1:28:23] today in october 2020 and events come up
[1:28:27] and you think oh my
[1:28:29] well how could this why would this how
[1:28:32] could this
[1:28:33] was that you lord are you doing
[1:28:37] something
[1:28:38] are you orchestrating some this even
[1:28:40] looked
[1:28:42] demonically wicked horrible
[1:28:45] this looked very bad
[1:28:48] this wasn't just uh you know somebody
[1:28:52] slipping out a word they shouldn't say
[1:28:54] that this this
[1:28:56] is a this is a bad situation
[1:28:59] if this was evolving
[1:29:03] as it was in the garden of eden it was
[1:29:06] it was just
[1:29:07] as vile as it was then right but see
[1:29:10] that wasn't the situation
[1:29:13] if you just stop as i've read this
[1:29:16] and and take away the fact that we know
[1:29:18] now it was jesus christ and of the holy
[1:29:21] ghost
[1:29:22] and you just see a woman and she's
[1:29:23] pregnant i see
[1:29:26] they called jesus an illegitimate child
[1:29:29] brother brahma said they did
[1:29:30] that's not in the bible you can't read
[1:29:32] it in most places you can see the
[1:29:33] inference that
[1:29:35] when many of the pharisees and religious
[1:29:36] leaders come forth you can hear the
[1:29:38] inference that jesus was illegitimate
[1:29:40] but it's not in the bible
[1:29:41] exactly like that brother branham said
[1:29:43] they believed he was illegitimate child
[1:29:45] and i'm sure they probably did believe
[1:29:47] he was an illegitimate child
[1:29:49] even though their own torah their own
[1:29:53] holy book told them a virgin was going
[1:29:54] to conceive all they had to do is go
[1:29:56] back in isaiah and try to match up the
[1:29:58] word with the event
[1:30:00] and see that the event that was taken
[1:30:02] was a fulfillment of a prophecy
[1:30:04] that a virgin would conceive that's all
[1:30:07] they had to do
[1:30:08] but you know that's not the first thing
[1:30:10] most of the time that people think about
[1:30:12] right first thing that people think
[1:30:14] about is the worst
[1:30:17] it's got to be the worst oh she had to
[1:30:19] have done something with somebody
[1:30:20] she had to have made a mistake she had
[1:30:22] to have slipped up with a guy or
[1:30:23] something
[1:30:24] that's the first thing most people think
[1:30:26] right admit it you know it's the truth
[1:30:29] most of us if not all of us at some
[1:30:31] point
[1:30:32] when something like that happens or you
[1:30:34] hear something the first thing you think
[1:30:36] is the worst
[1:30:36] right that's mostly what happens
[1:30:39] especially if it's somebody that's close
[1:30:41] to you or somebody you love or something
[1:30:43] it's just the way it is it's
[1:30:46] human thinking that's why we have to get
[1:30:49] beyond that
[1:30:50] right lord are you doing this is there a
[1:30:52] reason you're allowing this
[1:30:54] yes well this event didn't happen very
[1:30:57] very long
[1:30:58] because joseph 19th verse then
[1:31:02] a man a just man not willing to make her
[1:31:05] a public example was going to put her
[1:31:06] away
[1:31:07] he was getting and that was the right
[1:31:09] thing to do
[1:31:11] but while he thought on these things
[1:31:13] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[1:31:15] unto him
[1:31:16] in a dream saying joseph thou son of
[1:31:18] david fear not to take unto thee mary
[1:31:20] thy wife
[1:31:21] for that which is conceived of her is of
[1:31:23] the holy ghost
[1:31:24] this is god's doing joseph where am i
[1:31:27] god is doing this if your question is
[1:31:31] is this you lord the answer is yes
[1:31:35] god is doing this yes she's conceived
[1:31:38] but that conception is a fulfillment of
[1:31:40] isaiah 9
[1:31:42] and that this woman is still a virtuous
[1:31:44] woman that's going to conceive
[1:31:46] and bring forth jesus christ the savior
[1:31:48] of the world amen
[1:31:49] and they call him an illegitimate child
[1:31:51] why because all they could see
[1:31:53] was the natural right all they could see
[1:31:56] was the physical
[1:31:57] all they could see was this what was
[1:31:59] there tickling their senses a cta spill
[1:32:02] smelling here
[1:32:03] oh friend don't miss god because of your
[1:32:05] intellect
[1:32:07] don't miss god because of your senses
[1:32:09] don't miss god because it's not
[1:32:11] something you can understand
[1:32:12] right let god minister to that let god
[1:32:15] speak to you now maybe it is
[1:32:17] demonic maybe it is of the devil we
[1:32:19] don't know
[1:32:20] but don't just dismiss it don't miss god
[1:32:22] because of it
[1:32:24] god this may be you doing this now god
[1:32:27] came to
[1:32:28] joseph and told him specifically joseph
[1:32:30] don't you do this now
[1:32:32] this this is of the holy ghost this is
[1:32:35] god doing this
[1:32:35] this is god's working now don't you get
[1:32:37] rid of her she's still your wife she's
[1:32:39] going to be your wife
[1:32:40] but now what do you think in all of this
[1:32:43] that god is working and telling joseph
[1:32:45] this that all the other people around
[1:32:47] them are thinking especially the
[1:32:48] religious leaders and the righteous ones
[1:32:51] those that are in high authority
[1:32:53] positions in the
[1:32:55] pharisees and sadducees and and holy
[1:32:57] righteous men
[1:32:58] yes what do you think they're thinking
[1:33:02] right what do you think their
[1:33:03] conversation is to other people
[1:33:06] oh don't have nothing to do with them oh
[1:33:09] don't say anything to them don't you
[1:33:10] better stay away from them
[1:33:12] don't have anything to do with that
[1:33:14] person oh they're ill-famed
[1:33:16] oh they're they're they're demons all
[1:33:19] day they're
[1:33:19] horrible people oh friend
[1:33:23] and people do that and ruin other
[1:33:24] people's lives who's guilty for that now
[1:33:27] you are amen amen you are and
[1:33:30] god is the one orchestrating the whole
[1:33:32] time
[1:33:33] god is the one doing it the whole time
[1:33:36] oh have mercy
[1:33:37] help us lord yes yes i mean friend i i
[1:33:40] told you a story about my sister and and
[1:33:42] i will tell you
[1:33:43] it wasn't right what she did right but
[1:33:45] my sister married a man
[1:33:47] and and he was a horrible guy i knew
[1:33:49] that when i was young
[1:33:50] just a horrible guy i don't think the
[1:33:52] marriage lasted but a month or two or
[1:33:54] something didn't last long
[1:33:56] my sister ended up living with her
[1:33:59] husband
[1:34:00] who was still her husband become her
[1:34:01] ex-husband living with
[1:34:03] his sister his sister was going to a
[1:34:07] message church
[1:34:08] and in the message and some of their
[1:34:09] family was some of their family wasn't
[1:34:11] you know how that is so some of the
[1:34:14] family was so he went she went to live
[1:34:16] with his sister and she
[1:34:18] started taking her to this message
[1:34:20] church and the lord moved on her heart
[1:34:22] and she came to my dad with this message
[1:34:28] was that god's way of getting us in the
[1:34:30] truth
[1:34:31] well that's the way it worked out amen
[1:34:33] right
[1:34:35] that's the way it worked out a broken
[1:34:38] marriage
[1:34:38] like that and living with her because
[1:34:41] she was too ashamed to come back home
[1:34:43] so to go live she went to live with his
[1:34:45] sister
[1:34:46] got in the message that spoke to my dad
[1:34:48] my she finally convinced my dad we went
[1:34:51] to church
[1:34:51] my dad came home and said this is what
[1:34:53] i've been looking for my whole life
[1:34:57] been in it ever since you may say that's
[1:35:00] wrong
[1:35:01] it may be but it was god doing it right
[1:35:04] that's my opinion
[1:35:05] i believe it yeah god's the one that did
[1:35:07] that you think well
[1:35:08] that she shouldn't have done that you
[1:35:10] know she's been married divorced blah
[1:35:11] blah blah
[1:35:12] you know what people can be so
[1:35:13] self-righteous and so uh uh
[1:35:16] high and mighty and and so legalistic
[1:35:18] that they don't give anybody a little
[1:35:20] bit of grace except themselves
[1:35:21] right they're not willing to give
[1:35:23] anybody else a little bit of grace
[1:35:24] to say you know maybe god did this yes
[1:35:27] maybe there's a reason god allowed this
[1:35:29] to happen
[1:35:30] maybe god orchestrated this because he
[1:35:32] has a greater plan
[1:35:33] his ways are beyond our ways his
[1:35:35] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[1:35:38] yes we can't understand it sometimes but
[1:35:40] god works it for a reason
[1:35:42] yes and it's going to accomplish what he
[1:35:44] sent it forth for
[1:35:45] it's going to do exactly what god wanted
[1:35:47] it to do
[1:35:49] even if a virgin is standing here and
[1:35:51] she's
[1:35:52] with child and they don't understand it
[1:35:55] oh an illegitimate child
[1:35:57] why would joseph even stay with her
[1:35:59] right because this was god doing it am i
[1:36:02] right
[1:36:02] now who's responsible for all of the
[1:36:05] things that was said against her
[1:36:07] in him who's responsible for turning
[1:36:10] other people against them
[1:36:11] who's responsible for ruining their
[1:36:14] lives
[1:36:14] to the point where they didn't ruin it
[1:36:16] you know what i'm saying
[1:36:18] in society and things like that who is
[1:36:20] the one
[1:36:21] those are the people that's going to be
[1:36:22] held accountable friends i don't want to
[1:36:25] be one of those people either
[1:36:26] help me lord yes that would conceive the
[1:36:29] herds of the holy ghost she shall bring
[1:36:31] forth the son and thou shalt call his
[1:36:33] name jesus
[1:36:34] for he shall save his people from their
[1:36:36] sins
[1:36:37] now all this was done that it might be
[1:36:39] fulfilled which is spoken of the lord by
[1:36:41] the prophet saying behold a virgin shall
[1:36:43] uh shall be with child and shall bring
[1:36:45] forth the son and thou shalt and they
[1:36:46] shall call his name emmanuel which being
[1:36:48] interpreted is god with us
[1:36:51] when joseph being raised we'll just skip
[1:36:53] on from there
[1:36:54] let's go over to uh another scripture
[1:36:56] acts
[1:37:00] acts chapter five i almost
[1:37:03] said this just now but
[1:37:08] a very wise man yeah he's a pharisee but
[1:37:11] he's a very wise man
[1:37:13] name was gamalia the man that paul saw
[1:37:17] taught at or learned at the feet of
[1:37:19] gamalia
[1:37:21] but one of the greatest statements in
[1:37:22] the bible let's start with the 34th
[1:37:24] verse
[1:37:25] acts chapter 5 verse 34
[1:37:30] is in this one of the greatest is right
[1:37:34] is right
[1:37:34] one of the greatest pieces of advice let
[1:37:37] me just put it that way
[1:37:39] let's read it you probably know it but
[1:37:40] let's read it to to to
[1:37:42] try to wrap this up then stood there one
[1:37:45] of one of them in
[1:37:46] one in the council a pharisee named
[1:37:48] gamalio
[1:37:50] a doctor of the law had a reputation
[1:37:52] among all the people and commanded to
[1:37:54] put the apostles
[1:37:55] forth a little space and he said unto
[1:37:59] them
[1:38:00] ye men of israel take heed to yourselves
[1:38:03] what he intend to do
[1:38:05] as touching these men now they were they
[1:38:08] had
[1:38:09] uh captured them and they had imprisoned
[1:38:11] them and beat them and everything
[1:38:13] and gamalia's warning them now he's
[1:38:15] warning the religious
[1:38:17] leaders the pharisees right be careful
[1:38:19] what you do to these men
[1:38:22] for before these days rose up uh
[1:38:25] theaters boasting himself to be somebody
[1:38:28] to whom a number of men about 400 joined
[1:38:30] themselves so look at this
[1:38:32] i i feel rushed let's go back a minute
[1:38:36] i'm going to slow down let's read this
[1:38:41] gemelli is telling them to be careful
[1:38:44] how they handle these men
[1:38:46] okay that's the first point be careful
[1:38:48] what you do to these men
[1:38:50] be careful as you touching these men how
[1:38:53] you handle this situation
[1:38:56] and look at his reasoning he said before
[1:38:59] these days before now
[1:39:03] theodus boasting himself to be somebody
[1:39:08] oh lord amen look at all that around the
[1:39:12] world today
[1:39:12] people out there ministers boasting
[1:39:14] themselves to be something
[1:39:16] and most of the time something they're
[1:39:18] not to whom a number of men
[1:39:21] look now theaters is boasting himself to
[1:39:24] be somebody
[1:39:25] and a number of men about 400 of them
[1:39:29] joined themselves to him who was slain
[1:39:32] and all as many as obeyed him were
[1:39:35] scattered
[1:39:36] and brought to naught so
[1:39:39] you see these things out here happening
[1:39:41] friend don't go well i
[1:39:43] wonder how this could happen i wonder
[1:39:45] why this would be i wonder how people
[1:39:48] can follow them
[1:39:49] just remember that's scriptural very
[1:39:52] much
[1:39:52] right gamalia's reminding them us today
[1:39:57] that theaters was the same way he had
[1:39:59] 400 people in his congregation
[1:40:02] and of course because it wasn't of god
[1:40:05] he fell
[1:40:07] what did flat say right uh
[1:40:11] he was slain and all those that were
[1:40:14] following him or obeyed him
[1:40:16] were scattered and that work was brought
[1:40:19] to nothing
[1:40:20] right amen so don't worry about it
[1:40:23] you're on tv or you see a tbn or
[1:40:25] whatever you hear about these great
[1:40:27] ministers or those that boast themselves
[1:40:29] whatever maybe even in the message
[1:40:31] boast themselves to be something that
[1:40:32] they're not
[1:40:34] and people following them don't worry
[1:40:36] god's got it under control
[1:40:38] he said lord is that you right amen
[1:40:42] well this shouldn't be like that how do
[1:40:44] you know
[1:40:45] maybe it is supposed to be like that
[1:40:47] right maybe god's got something he's
[1:40:49] working to bring
[1:40:50] it around to whatever he wants to
[1:40:51] accomplish on the end right right
[1:40:53] let it alone yes that's what gamalia is
[1:40:56] saying
[1:40:57] let it alone because you see this work
[1:41:00] and what happened here and it wasn't of
[1:41:03] god the man
[1:41:04] died and they all scattered and it came
[1:41:05] to nothing so don't worry about it
[1:41:07] right amen god's got his hand on
[1:41:11] what he's doing great advice right
[1:41:15] great advice yes after this man rose up
[1:41:18] judas of galilee in the days of texting
[1:41:20] he drew away much people after him
[1:41:23] he also perished and all even as many as
[1:41:26] obeyed him
[1:41:27] were dispersed so gamalia is giving
[1:41:30] examples
[1:41:31] if it's not of god it's not going to
[1:41:33] come to amount to anything anyway that's
[1:41:35] right
[1:41:36] don't worry about it it's not worth your
[1:41:38] time it's not worth your effort
[1:41:39] you can pray for them oh friend can i
[1:41:42] encourage you today
[1:41:43] let's pray for them those are souls yes
[1:41:46] those people scattered about
[1:41:47] not a pastor those are souls those
[1:41:49] people are if this happens those people
[1:41:52] are going to be hurting
[1:41:54] those people are going to be need
[1:41:56] because of this
[1:41:58] but the truth of it is it's not going to
[1:42:00] come to anything
[1:42:02] god's going to take care of it and if
[1:42:04] his people are there
[1:42:05] he's going to pull them out amen because
[1:42:08] if they're his
[1:42:09] and they're in a place they're not
[1:42:10] supposed to be god's going to take care
[1:42:11] of that
[1:42:12] right you just let god take care of them
[1:42:15] now i say unto you refrain from these
[1:42:18] men
[1:42:19] and let them alone for if this counsel
[1:42:22] of this work be of men
[1:42:23] it will come to not but
[1:42:27] but if it is of god
[1:42:30] ye cannot overthrow it and you will be
[1:42:34] finding yourself fighting against god
[1:42:37] amen amen now talk about some of the
[1:42:41] good advice
[1:42:42] right especially spoken to the ears of
[1:42:45] the men
[1:42:45] that were frothingly hot and mad and
[1:42:49] ready to beat these men and even kill
[1:42:51] them for what they were doing
[1:42:53] but he said look we are men of god
[1:42:56] we consider ourselves men of god right
[1:42:58] and if this
[1:42:59] is not of god it's going to be like
[1:43:00] those others it's going to go away it's
[1:43:03] going to disappear it's going to come to
[1:43:04] nothing
[1:43:06] but if it's god is that you
[1:43:10] lord yes if it is god you're going to
[1:43:12] find yourself fighting against
[1:43:14] god if you're fighting these men you're
[1:43:17] fighting those men and those men are
[1:43:18] sent by god you're going to be finding
[1:43:20] yourself fighting against god
[1:43:22] now that's where a lot of people get in
[1:43:24] trouble today
[1:43:25] because they sit there and they say well
[1:43:27] how can that be of god
[1:43:29] well who are you to say amen amen
[1:43:33] amen there's probably i'm gonna say
[1:43:35] something
[1:43:36] i don't know why but i'm gonna say it
[1:43:38] there's probably people in this city
[1:43:40] that think this right here is not of god
[1:43:42] right
[1:43:43] but i'm here to tell you today and
[1:43:45] you're sitting here in these pews
[1:43:46] you know what it is you know this is the
[1:43:49] work of god right yeah no i'm not saying
[1:43:51] it's the only
[1:43:52] one right amen but did you know this is
[1:43:55] the work of god
[1:43:56] yeah i know it is yeah and when i feel
[1:43:58] the presence of god so strong like that
[1:43:59] again this morning i just say thank you
[1:44:01] lord yes
[1:44:02] amen amen thank you lord amen but if
[1:44:06] it's not a god come to nothing but don't
[1:44:08] fight against it friend because you
[1:44:10] might be fighting against god
[1:44:12] got to be careful amen jesus uh
[1:44:15] the bible says romans says uh that he
[1:44:18] have mercy on who he'll have mercy he'll
[1:44:20] have compassion on you
[1:44:22] compassion whatever god does that's up
[1:44:25] to him he's sovereign he does this he
[1:44:27] will
[1:44:28] one more scripture i want to read real
[1:44:30] quick and we'll get to we'll get to my
[1:44:31] story here
[1:44:34] acts chapter 15 not too far down now
[1:44:37] um over acts chapter 15 verse 36
[1:44:46] acts chapter 15 verse 36
[1:44:49] now paul and barnabas had a very
[1:44:52] successful ministry together
[1:44:54] and the book of action noticed most of
[1:44:56] the time when they went out
[1:44:58] they went out by twos two men went this
[1:45:01] way two men went this way and
[1:45:03] how they did they mostly went by twos
[1:45:05] and paul and barnabas you can read
[1:45:07] through acts had a very successful
[1:45:10] ministry together but there come a time
[1:45:14] where i say you look in the bible
[1:45:18] i say that these men needed to
[1:45:21] go about their own businesses in their
[1:45:24] own ways
[1:45:25] and god orchestrating them both right
[1:45:28] now do you believe that if god could
[1:45:32] have a tremendously successful ministry
[1:45:35] with paul and barnabas that he could not
[1:45:38] have
[1:45:38] as equally or more so successful
[1:45:41] ministry
[1:45:41] in paul and in barnabas
[1:45:45] well sure he could yes he used both men
[1:45:48] equally wherever they were
[1:45:49] just like he used them both together
[1:45:51] right and some days after paul said unto
[1:45:54] barnabas let us go again and visit our
[1:45:56] brother and in every city where we have
[1:45:57] preached the word of the lord
[1:45:59] see how they do barnabas determined that
[1:46:02] you know bart is probably thinking
[1:46:03] that's a great idea paul let's
[1:46:06] let's do that let's take with them uh
[1:46:09] let's take with us
[1:46:10] john whose surname is mark but paul
[1:46:12] thought not good to take him
[1:46:14] with them who departed them from
[1:46:16] pamphilia and went not with them to the
[1:46:19] work
[1:46:20] and the contention was so sharp between
[1:46:22] them that they departed asunder one from
[1:46:25] the other and so barnabas took mark
[1:46:27] and sailed into cyprus paul chose silas
[1:46:30] and departed being recommended by the
[1:46:32] brethren unto the grace of god
[1:46:34] and he went through syria and sisliya
[1:46:36] confirming the churches
[1:46:38] now from that time their contention
[1:46:41] you think oh well we're brothers
[1:46:45] we we love one another absolutely i
[1:46:47] don't think the love between paul and
[1:46:49] barnabas changed
[1:46:51] but they got such a contention between
[1:46:53] them
[1:46:54] and you know what david said brings
[1:46:56] contention
[1:46:58] you know what psalm says brings
[1:47:00] contention
[1:47:01] pride right pride bringeth contention
[1:47:04] right
[1:47:05] but there was such a contention between
[1:47:07] these two men
[1:47:08] they had to split right you think oh my
[1:47:12] what a successful ministry for jesus
[1:47:14] christ
[1:47:15] and now it's all ruined no no no no
[1:47:18] is this you lord god say yeah
[1:47:22] because i want him to go over here and i
[1:47:24] want him to go over here
[1:47:26] why i don't know right spread the gospel
[1:47:30] more
[1:47:31] you can you can go to two places instead
[1:47:33] of one right
[1:47:34] you can get two groups of people instead
[1:47:36] of one but it may be a lot more to it
[1:47:38] than just that
[1:47:40] i don't know why maybe barnabas was
[1:47:42] decided to go somewhere with this man
[1:47:44] that they would have been more
[1:47:45] successful in preaching to that group
[1:47:48] than paul would have right or silas
[1:47:52] or silas needed to be with paul to go
[1:47:54] over here to do this to get in jail
[1:47:56] we don't know but what we do know is
[1:47:59] god's orchestrating this to bring about
[1:48:02] whatever the purpose that he has for it
[1:48:03] to happen
[1:48:06] is that you lord is
[1:48:09] is this the way it is because you
[1:48:11] brought it to be that way yes
[1:48:13] amen yes friend i have never guessed i'd
[1:48:16] have never
[1:48:17] believed in a billion years that we
[1:48:19] would be sitting in this little building
[1:48:21] here on country club this morning having
[1:48:23] church
[1:48:24] never would never would but god has a
[1:48:28] reason for everything
[1:48:29] yes and the best thing that we can do
[1:48:31] lord is that you
[1:48:32] are you the one doing this sometimes
[1:48:35] it's hard
[1:48:36] sometimes it's very deep struggle
[1:48:39] sometimes it takes
[1:48:40] friends from you right acquaintances
[1:48:42] from you sometimes it takes away
[1:48:44] everything from you that was familiar to
[1:48:46] you yes
[1:48:47] he jerks out that comfort zone
[1:48:51] like that eagle stirring the nest
[1:48:53] sometimes god wants to reach we get a
[1:48:55] little comfortable god wants to reach in
[1:48:56] and
[1:48:57] grab a big hunk of rabbit skin and throw
[1:48:59] it out so the next time you sit down you
[1:49:01] don't sit down a nice comfy rabbit skin
[1:49:03] you're sitting down on a big briar not
[1:49:06] so comfortable anymore
[1:49:07] right time to move
[1:49:10] this is not the way i remember it
[1:49:15] time to do something different there you
[1:49:17] go well that's good i finally got your
[1:49:19] attention now i can lead you where i
[1:49:20] want you to go
[1:49:21] right amen let me read this
[1:49:26] tom's getting away from me uh this story
[1:49:30] now brother brown tells this story two
[1:49:31] or three different places i like this
[1:49:33] one
[1:49:34] this was in 1957 january when divine
[1:49:38] love is projected
[1:49:39] sovereign grace takes its place so
[1:49:41] please bear with me a moment it's kind
[1:49:42] of long
[1:49:44] i'll try to read it through he said that
[1:49:47] morning
[1:49:47] i was teaching the boys turned out to be
[1:49:49] leo and gene
[1:49:51] i was teaching the boys on love now
[1:49:53] closely before closing
[1:49:55] i looked coming down the road and i seen
[1:49:57] a little object rolling and tumbling as
[1:49:59] it came down the road
[1:50:01] and i looked and it was about i suppose
[1:50:02] 10 o'clock in the day
[1:50:04] boys and what it was it was a possum
[1:50:08] you know what possums are up here now
[1:50:11] anyone who knows wildlife knows that
[1:50:13] possums travel at nighttime
[1:50:15] they're blind in the day so here
[1:50:19] uh was this possum traveling in the
[1:50:21] daytime
[1:50:22] and he come down here where there was no
[1:50:24] fences two or three houses coming from
[1:50:26] the woods
[1:50:27] about 500 yards across the highway here
[1:50:30] he come
[1:50:30] up the lane and my house is fenced with
[1:50:34] a
[1:50:34] rocked gate and when the opossum got
[1:50:37] even with my
[1:50:38] house he turned and came in
[1:50:41] and i looked and i said there's a possum
[1:50:44] something has happened it's got
[1:50:46] rabies maybe it looked how it was acting
[1:50:49] tumbling rolling fighting trying to get
[1:50:52] in
[1:50:53] mr wood which was his next-door neighbor
[1:50:55] banks woods if you didn't know that he
[1:50:57] lived next door to brother brown
[1:50:59] mr wood had been raking in the yard and
[1:51:02] had a rake laying there
[1:51:04] and i said to the boys come out here
[1:51:05] just a moment and i run and got the rake
[1:51:07] and threw it over the possum and at the
[1:51:09] time
[1:51:10] the milkman came up mr gilmore we were
[1:51:13] looking at the possum and i said
[1:51:15] it must have rabies oh i said no
[1:51:18] i said no and look oh excuse this he
[1:51:21] said but
[1:51:22] maggots was all over its leg blow flies
[1:51:25] dog must have chewed it or it got run
[1:51:27] over by a car and mashed to pieces
[1:51:29] oh i said look how it is swollen up the
[1:51:32] great big leg is
[1:51:34] uh bigger than the other one and i said
[1:51:36] it's dying
[1:51:38] while i was holding the rake over the
[1:51:39] possum to my surprise
[1:51:41] a possum and a kangaroo is the only
[1:51:44] animals that pack their babies
[1:51:46] in a pocket and her pocket let out and
[1:51:49] she had
[1:51:49] nine little tiny naked babies
[1:51:52] and i said come here boys i'll teach you
[1:51:54] some more out of the bible
[1:51:56] i said perhaps the possum come in the
[1:51:58] day before there had been a very fine a
[1:52:02] very very fine beautiful young looking
[1:52:04] lady of our city that had a baby and she
[1:52:07] wrapped it in a blanket smothered it to
[1:52:09] death
[1:52:09] took it in a taxi and dropped it in the
[1:52:11] river
[1:52:13] and we were talking about that so i said
[1:52:15] that lovely young lady wasn't nothing
[1:52:17] like the mother that this possum is
[1:52:19] not because she was uh this girl
[1:52:23] but they they all do the same all
[1:52:26] women i guess he's referring to all do
[1:52:28] the same without christ
[1:52:31] but i said the morals of this possum is
[1:52:33] better than the morals of that woman for
[1:52:35] that woman didn't want her baby and took
[1:52:37] its life
[1:52:38] the police had her in jail but i said
[1:52:40] this old
[1:52:41] mother possum uh hasn't got over 30
[1:52:44] minutes to live
[1:52:46] she was biting the rape for she couldn't
[1:52:48] do usually when you touch them
[1:52:50] they uh they call they they do what you
[1:52:53] call
[1:52:53] play possum you ever seen a possum play
[1:52:56] possum
[1:52:57] that's dead they play dead
[1:53:00] if they feel threatened the possum will
[1:53:01] roll over and act like it's dead
[1:53:03] falls but she was making her way
[1:53:06] somewhere
[1:53:07] and uh and i said she is fighting the
[1:53:10] rake and she's so frantic but she's a
[1:53:12] real mother
[1:53:13] she'll give this last 30 minutes of her
[1:53:15] life fighting for her babies
[1:53:18] i said that's a mother's love she loved
[1:53:20] her babies
[1:53:21] i raised up the rake and went on uh the
[1:53:24] possum rolling and it went right up to
[1:53:26] my door
[1:53:27] and there she fell at his door exhausted
[1:53:30] i said she's dead i went up there
[1:53:32] punched her with a rake but i seen she
[1:53:33] wasn't dead
[1:53:35] she still got a little grin on the side
[1:53:37] of her face she ever seen a possum
[1:53:39] they had that grin they they grin that
[1:53:41] goes up the side of their mouth right
[1:53:43] kind of weird if you've never seen it
[1:53:44] it's
[1:53:44] really unusual how opossum does grin
[1:53:47] like a possum that's kind of a southern
[1:53:49] expression they say
[1:53:50] grin like a possum that's what it means
[1:53:52] anyway
[1:53:53] and i punched her to the right she had
[1:53:55] that little grin on the side and i
[1:53:56] looked at the leg laying there all
[1:53:58] sprawled out the little babies nursing
[1:53:59] on that poor dying mother
[1:54:01] mr ms woods come up miss wood which is a
[1:54:04] sweet christian woman in terms of
[1:54:06] what she knows she's a veterinarian said
[1:54:08] brother brown
[1:54:09] kill the possum and get it out of its
[1:54:11] misery said the little ones has a round
[1:54:14] round mouth and they cannot take a
[1:54:15] bottle and they're too young
[1:54:17] anyhow they're just a few hours old so
[1:54:20] you'll have to take the little
[1:54:22] ones and kill them oh i thought i can't
[1:54:24] do that
[1:54:26] i said i just can't oh she said brother
[1:54:28] branham you're not going to let that
[1:54:29] poor thing lay there like that the
[1:54:31] little possums nursing that milk from

[1:58:58] thought oh

[1:59:16] can't kill her it's just something in me
[1:59:18] i just can't kill her
[1:59:19] god finally gets up early in the morning
[1:59:21] god finally speaks to him and says i
[1:59:23] sent that possum to you
[1:59:25] i specifically sent that possum to your
[1:59:28] front door
[1:59:28] and she's laid there for 24 hours
[1:59:31] waiting her turn for you to pray for her
[1:59:33] and you've never done it right
[1:59:37] he said is that you lord is that you god
[1:59:42] i walked out on the porch little rebecca
[1:59:44] standing there looking at the mother
[1:59:45] opossum yet she comes by it from the
[1:59:47] house
[1:59:48] i went out to the apostle and i said god

[2:00:52] gate turned around as if to say

[2:01:28] dipped it and he took care of it and it
[2:01:30] was a beautiful dog
[2:01:31] never even dawned on him that god would
