than he that is in the world yes hallelujah praise the Lord amen God bless you amen as I said welcome to the house of the Lord I appreciate you being here today amen I just have one prayer request here uh to mention to you that I have written down it was uh sister brother Pat had texted me a little earlier and said that sister Pat was having a lot of pain having trouble resting sleeping so please remember sister Pat prayer this morning she's having quite difficulty in pain please remember her amen I had a rough week myself this last week's probably the worst week I've had since I've been working that job uh over 70 hours worked over 15 hours Friday uh eating dinner at 10 o'clock at night going to bed at 11 or 12 or I think Friday night I didn't even go to bed until about almost one o'clock fortunately though Saturday I drove so Saturday I could sleep as late as I needed to before the drive yesterday but I don't mind admitting as a 57 year old it took a toll out of me so amen but the Lord is good and I appreciate the Lord's blessings amen press through it and do what's necessary to continue to serve him as we do as I've said and as I preach we do as unto the Lord amen everything we do we do we done to him praise the Lord amen so that's the only prayer request I had here does anyone else have a something on your heart for yeah um Leah went to it's been having a lot of pain on her shoulder and a lot of shoulder and we prescribe something but um it's just been real tough for her she's not the type to be idle and I have to tell her I'll take care of it I'll do it and um just we need to remember her in prayer as the Lord delivered from that pain I think yes praise the Lord that prayer it's brother Dennis's wife Leah anyone else [Music] yes um they especially at my apartment complex seen a lot more homeless people having problems like where did they go and this morning I found a piece of cardboard on my grill and I saw a lady Dustin herself off and took off apparently she probably stayed right there and seeing it more happened even in other parts of my apartment accomplished yeah to pray for the homeless that they start Sheltering because it's just heat even just not just Sawyer it's all over the United States yeah devastating they're human beings absolutely amen it is summer isn't it 110 we're not uh we're not uh we know that this time of year it's going to be 110. that's just that's just the way it is in Tucson I've been here to probably over 25 years total in every summer in July it's 110 plus I've played golf at 114 I've been out at 117 one time it was like really hot in the 80s so it is hot but there are people that are suffering as a result of it so pray that the monsoon relief is coming soon it rains three or four nights in El Paso while we were there so their Monsoon was already starting to kind of unfold so that's a good sign for us because it just kind of moves back from there as it comes out and kind of sweeps across us you know most of our clouds come from the southeast so it's that's gone a good sign is it's going to be hitting us pretty soon so and with the heat the eats what draws it into so I appreciate your thought of other people brother Danny absolutely amen anyone else have a need of prayer you have unspoken requests for those hearts today let's stand if we could let's go brother Dennis if you would take these clothes Lord Jesus with all our hearts yes and revenue through your Holy Spirit knowing that you're mindful of artists Jesus thank you the Lord is you said to your people If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves yes Lord Jesus pray and see my face and and get away from their wicked ways I will hear their prayers I will give them their heart's desire yes Lord Jesus I will heal their land thank you for the Lord still holds true to us as Believers as our Pastor said already Satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he made Devour the father help us you are greater you are more powerful than us and whatever comes our way it's not us trying to fight the devil as Believers we have completely surrendered to you yes and it's you fighting our battles for us amen thank you Lord to recognize that granite and it is our so late they just people killing one another for no reason it's just absolute chaos and we know Lord we need to be more sincere and I walk with you because without the Holy Spirit truly being sealed being a token in our lives yes Father we are going to miss it oh god oh we think we can fight the devil alone we are going to fail you every time of the world is just trying to weigh us down oh the this scripture says Lord if you love the world of the things that are in the world the love of God is not giving you amen the enemy's trying to get us a compromise do you act like the world speak like the world dress like the world um be identified with the world when that should be the complete opposite we should be identified with Christ in his word in this reality of the message of the hour has come and Lord Jesus we know that you're with us no matter what the devil throws at us um when Satan comes in like a flood you'll raise a standard yes amen if God be with us who can be against us thank you Lord and Lord there are needs amongst your family your Believers this morning Lord my wife and different ones need a healing touch father for you we know you are a great physician amen a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities yes Jesus we are healed oh God and fathers we I can feel the compassion and the sincerity when my brother shared of all these homeless people Jesus but here's the thing that's above all one soul is a promise it is worth well more to you than ten thousand worlds thank you Lord and Lord may they hear the gospel and accept you as the Lord and savior of their life yes yes and Lord there is a uh a sincere request and see that these people find shelter and and find their needs

Carol's surgery went well so praise the Lord for that her sister sister Deedee's doctor told her to go back to the valley to see if her breathing would get better but and she slept better that night

our feet then turn in the scripture we're going to go back over to Genesis again chapter 3 we're going to read same verse that we've been reading here past few weeks amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 . How Great Thou Art Lord [Music] Genesis 3 21 read this verse of scripture let's be seated yeah Genesis 3 21 4 read now let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus we're so thankful father again for your presence Lord for your life and uh your health the blessings you give us Lord every day thank you Lord for this place for this time thank you Lord for watching over and keeping us Lord to bring us through another week Lord another week to another day to worship you to glorify and magnify you to come into this place from out of the world Lord expecting to meet with you once again Lord you promise that we're two or three are gathered in your name you'd be there in the midst we know you to be here today Lord not because we feel anything necessarily but because we know the promise of your word guarantees us that you would be here because we are not here in the name of a man we are not hearing the name of a denomination we are only here in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior and because that Lord you promised to be here so Lord we just trust that you continue to move in this service Lord now as we open the pages of this Bible trusting Lord that as we read it Lord that you would reveal it to us and show us in here what you'd have us to see and know today Lord we just be careful Lord to give you the thanks and praise because you alone are worthy of all the all the praise worship Glory adoration all that is said and done father you are great there is no one like you there was no other gods before you above you below you God there are no other gods but you the Lord Jesus Christ and we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and praise for all that is said and done anoint lips anoint the ears Lord gotta speak what you'd have to be heard today that whatever the purpose you accomplish for this service would be done today Father for we know that your world will not return void accomplish that Lord you send it forth for Lord I pray that you bless us now as we continue on with this service it should speak to us from your word glow us grow Us in Faith Lord yes help us to grow closer to you more like you Lord for this last day Lord when you look down you look around and see that there's just no difference between us and you and Lord it'd be time to go home to be with you father we know that that time is right at hand so grant us your grace once again for services we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21. scripture says and unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them you could be seated if you'd like amen we started this scripture uh every service here on the subject that we've been on for the past six weeks now this would be the seventh um would you recognize that the Lord's the one that started this uh and was the one who put it in motion to begin with excuse me amen when he spoke back here even in Genesis chapter 3. it was God's the one that took the sheepskin and slew them and threw the sheepskin in amen the bloody sheepskin for Adam and Eve to wear that they would be able to come out into God's presence again but I want to go over to Ephesians chapter 1. uh and continue our thought for today the last two Services we've been dealing with the last well this would be the Holy Spirit part seven the last couple of services have been about the false anointed ones today I want to talk about the holy spirit being the Seal of God Amen the Holy Spirit uh being the Seal of God Amen Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 we'll read a couple of scriptures here to draw our context from today chapter one verse 13 let's read here in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory each almost every word that we just read could take a week of ministering because it's so much that's involved in what and what Paul is telling the mature Ephesian church about the Holy Spirit and speaking to us today about the importance of the Holy Spirit and and what is is involved the necessity of the Holy Spirit and also being the earnest which we know is just simply a down payment remember we talked about that Holy Spirit and of course the the on and the end part of the Holy Spirit the anointing of the Holy Spirit the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit or the New Birth uh that that uh presence of that Spirit uh being being now we see the actual seal that seals your soul amen that is the down payment it is simply what it takes to get us to where we want to go amen notice when you buy a house and you put down earnest money an earnest money is simply a down payment if you buy a car you put down earnest money or you put down a down payment the down payment is simply something to get you in the car a down payment is simply something to put you in the house amen but thank God we know that that Earnest is only what we need to put down because he made the rest amen he paid the price praise the Lord so and send us back the earnest which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase possession and to the praise of his glory which we could go back in Romans 8 but that's not our subject today of the uh of the Redemption of the purchased possession the Final Redemption is to take place with this bride when she goes home to be with him amen we've already been redeemed we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb but the finalization of that Redemption is when this bride goes home to be with him amen again of Romans 8 23 tells us about that but now let's look at this seal for a few moments uh when you've heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believe ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise so we see here that the holy spirit is actually to seal himself amen the Holy Spirit himself is this seal praise the Lord let's go over one more scripture before we continue on chapter four Ephesians still in Ephesians chapter 4. verse 30. amen Ephesians 4 30. it says it grieved not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption amen where is brother ran him put it into your final destination amen until we reach the part of the place of the purpose of being sealed by the holy spirit so in this Holy Spirit now is of course thought to be grieved is what is the seal that seals us now the point of the ceiling uh don't necessarily need to bring it back over but again you can see the the little crew drawing of the Body Spirit Soul it's the soul that's been sealed amen the soul that's been sealed what is a seal what's the purpose of a seal amen as we know what a seal is the the seal is several things when when God sent the Holy Spirit uh on the day of Pentecost obviously we spoke the Holy Spirit came on them and they were filled amen so this the Holy Spirit itself in our lives serves a multitude of purposes it signifies a multitude of things and it's that that that signifies and identifies who you are in Christ that's why the holy spirit is is the essential thing that you have to be able to belong to God to go in a Rapture not not a water baptism that leads us to that not even our repentance which leads us to the baptism but it's the Seal of the holy spirit that proves who you are in him amen and that's our token that's what gets us to our final destination amen we are sealed until our final destination but the seal has a multitude of purposes look here even in the natural we'll talk some spiritual natural but the seal itself to think of what a seal is a seal is a substance that joins two things together amen a seal is something that can bring and actually join two things together vulcanized even if you will or where the two become one you can take two substances and you can seal them together to where the two substances actually join together in their molecular structure you can put heat on something to the place that actually to the anybody ever uh uh uh fixed the tire uh I have uh it used to be an old-time wave out now they just use a plug or glue or something but where they would actually take Heat and they would take a patch and I've done my bicycle tire like this when I was a kid and take enough heat and take a rubber patch and a rubber tire so you have to have the light substance and you put enough heat on it and the two substances actually come in to be one substance they come into one being one thing sealing the two together which seals the hole in the tire amen the two actually come together to be one friend when the Holy Ghost and Fire come down and sealed you with the Holy Spirit of promise if seal the holy spirit in you and make you and him one amen it made you and him one that's why the world is not supposed to be able to tell the difference between you and Christ they know there's something wrong with you they know there's something different wrong Oddball whatever want to call it today amen but they know there's something different they might not realize what it is but it's the fact that the two have become one the substances amen the word and the word the Holy Spirit seals to do together praise the Lord makes them one the seal is a substance that would join two things together praise the Lord it made him brother Adam says when Heaven and Earth embrace one another when he came and he put his own life in you and sealed his life in you with his life and made you and him one remember the body the spirit's temporal they're just here contacting the world see taste Phil smell here uh imagination fiction constant reason memory is those things that contact the world but the soul is what we're concerned about the soul is what God's concerned about the soul is what belongs to God which lives on which goes to its final destination amen is the soul of man so it's the soul that God he had joined the two together the seal joins the two together a seal is also to protect anything from passing in between the two substances a seal keeps it like the tire the tire sealing together kept any air from leaking back out right right amen it kept any water or anything else from coming in the seal protected anything from passing between the two so a seal actually stops uh uh anything from going back and forth when God seals the holy spirit in your soul he seals God in and the devil sealed out so when this seal brings the two together he stopped it stops the devil from having any claims whatsoever to your soul he stops him from having any access to your soul he can't even touch your soul anymore the only thing the devil can do at that point when you've been born again the Holy Spirit and fires come out and burn that old nature out and put his own nature in you the only thing the devil can touch about you is your body or your human spirit that's the only thing he can have access to anymore because when God sealed you with his Spirit he sealed the devil out and he disallowed any passage of the devil to come and have any influence on your soul anymore which is the nature of your spirit your soul is the nature of your spirit so if your soul is of God then nature is going to affect what your spirit does your spirit is the life of the body which is going to affect how you react or act on the outside so so literally the inside of the inside is what controls even your spirit and your body because your soul is the nature of the spirit spirits of nature of the body the life of the body so One controls the other then to the other so when God did that now when he did when he sealed you and he disallows by that seal the devil to ever come and penetrate that Soul anymore that also tells us that the Holy Spirit according to what we just read has sealed you in there and no longer leaves it does not lead a lot of people look I believe again I may have got this from the Armenians they think you can be saved one day and lost the next or in speaking of salvation but to be when you're born again that finalizes and you're sealed with the spirit of God that finalizes you until your destination amen there's no more doubt there's no more wrestling there's no more wondering amen when the devil shelled out God sealed in God's not going anywhere Saints you don't you don't you're not born again one day and lost the next right right it doesn't work that way if God comes and seals you with his Spirit you are sealed what the scripture say you are sealed until your final destination amen you are sealed until God takes you home amen what was it you are sealed unto the day of redemption praise the Lord or as like you said brother Barham said to you reach your destination and this is not our destination we're sojourners here we're pilgrims here we're strangers in a Strange Land here we don't belong here not in this world Cosmos amen this world this Earth belongs to us they don't know it but it does but this world Cosmos we don't belong here we're pilgrims our destination is heaven all right our destination is permanent residence with the Lord Jesus Christ yes amen so not only does it stop the devil from coming and having influence on your soul anymore but it also it also lets us know that we are sealed that God the holy spirit is sealed in there the person of Jesus Christ sealed in there until we're out of this world it'll no longer leave there's no passage again that's the point no passage between the two once this is once it has been sealed a seal signifies that a price has been paid amen when something when a price gets paid for something they'll that used to be they would use a seal they don't really do that anymore but when you pay the price or or when when uh uh the uh the price was met when the cost was met there would be a seal put on there to show that hey look my fare has been paid here I have the ticket I had the token I have I have the stamp whatever it was to prove a seal that proves that I I paid the price the price has been paid now of course we didn't pay the price he paid the price the Lord Jesus Paid the price not me but that seal by his purchase purchased us to him which signified that we had been bought with the price and our PRI and the price was the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ yes amen and the seal just signifies that I had been bought by him amen now if I've been bought by him then that means the seal must also show authentication or ownership the seal must also if the seal shows that a price has been paid then that also means that the seal proves ownership [Music] let's look at it real quick I got I wanted to read a scripture on this one that several of these you could go back and look at the scripture of many of these some of them I've had like I said temporal some of them are uh natural some scriptural second Timothy chapter two let's look at this real quick second Timothy chapter 2. we'll begin with uh verse 15. second Timothy 2 15. studied to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth amen now we know we've talked about that before that's the Holy Spirit that's that's God that's the Lord bring your Revelation into your heart into your life but Sean profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenus hymenius and uh felicis who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection passed already and overthrow the faith of some so notice remember as we talked about last week well the last couple of services actually that we talked about that God allows the tares to grow with the wheat right amen God allows it he allows as uh Paul calls names amen we've said before uh we're probably a little more diplomatic about it but Paul was not Paul didn't care hold and pulled and he punches he called names when he saw somebody not preaching the truth of the revealed word of the hour he called them out and he called them by name and he's calling here by name I'm edius and Felicia's he's telling these two are not preaching the gospel he's letting us he's letting them know there which lets us know if there was a harmonious and a felicus then trust me Saints there's high medius and Felicia's today amen that are not preaching the pure Gospel of the reveal word of the hour they're not amen that just it just tells us that scripture because concerning the truth they have aired Paul says saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith the faith of some gets overthrown it didn't say listen now these people who may be going astray a little bit down a path that's not the pure word even that it just says it over through their faith it did not say they were lost understand it does not say that it does not say they are Eternal Doom they might be don't know it just says that they've aired from the faith praise the Lord now when someone's aired from the faith that doesn't mean that they can't come back doesn't mean that they are lost it just means that at least at least for a temporary time the ministry of these two men have caused those people to believe something that is not scriptural and unfortunately that is that is the same thing happens today amen that people men will just say even women out in the world or ministering things outside the gospel of the pure word and is overthrowing the faith of people and they that and then they live usually defeated lives they don't know which way to work they're believing a false word but Paul is calling them by name I mean this is who concerning have overthrow the faith of some but listen this nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure even if the tares are still growing with the wheat the foundation of God is still sure amen that does not change oh wait oh oh wheat does never becomes a tear right right the faith might be overthrown but a wheat will never be anything but a wheat right it cannot be conversely a terror can never be a weed right it can't right the seed itself that was planted produces what it is and who planted the devil right the devil planted his seed to be who it was when the serpent planted his seed in the Garden of Eden what did it produce It produced a cane what did Cain do he killed his brother right right which was of the evil one as the Bible says the wicked one the devil he did exactly what that spirit that seed in him caused him to do thus we have serpent seed even yet today and people say oh there's no such thing I'll show you exactly in the Bible where it talks about serpent seek if you say no serpent seed in the Bible you just don't know your Bible yes amen and this isn't one of those that we know by Revelation it literally actually in the Bible says serpent seed it does praise the Lord but a weed can never be anything but a week the foundation of God standeth sure he has every one in the palm of his hand and he cannot cannot listen things don't worry about your family every one God has in the palm of his hand and he cannot lose one right right I don't care if they've aired I don't care what they're going what it looks like in the palm of God's hand he cannot lose one they're a weak and always World wheat always will be a week praise the Lord Foundation of God stand this short having this seal amen having this seal now which we've been talking about the Lord knoweth them that are his so what so when when the Holy Spirit when this seal proves that a price has been paid that has bought you amen I had a guy tell me this week uh you know it's hot it's it's working hard very hard work hot working hard long hours people especially people of the world are inevitably going to get irritated and upset and angry and lash out and yell and go with carry on whatever that just happens that's so that's the way things are next day I came was there and another guy used to be on our teams now another team he came up and uh he looked at me and he said when we started having that conversation he said but you you never get riled up I said uh I'm glad to hear you say he said that's the thing I like the most about you I said well uh uh I said ask James how riled up I was last night know the guys on our team I asked him how rolled up it was last night and he and he looked at me and said well Newton came down to probably about a normal level all the rest of us were way down here and he just came down a little bit to right here to where the normalcy is he said I like that about you I said wait you could have what I got you just gotta uh you gotta be ready and willing he meant to receive the Holy Spirit yes because that's the only thing that does it amen that's the only thing that separates everybody else there releases uh smoking drinking screaming yelling cussing whatever it is amen but the Lord gives us a peace that's inside that passes all understanding yeah amen that keeps it where it's supposed to be it just proves who they belong to and who I belong to yeah right amen who owns me who bought me who purchased me who sealed me that seal shows a purchase but a purchase if you bought something for that seal also shows that you own it now amen and who do we belong to we belong to him we belong to the Lord Jesus he knows the foundation of God stand is sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his by this seal he knows who are his praise the Lord I'm glad of that I'm glad that I know who I belong to I'm glad I know who I am you have to know who you are yes amen praise the Lord that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in a great house listen now in a gray house that doesn't say this is the Lord's House it just says a great house which is large multiples there are there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth Amen in a great house uh thinking about this place where we're working in this place uh there's a gold nugget and there's a lot of wood and Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor Amen in a gray house you got the tares and the Wheats basically what his name gold and silver it's got wood and Earth you got something to honor and some to dishonor in a gray house that's what it is raising together and that's what he's talking about I believe he's referring back to hymenius and what they're talking about but in the house of God now that belongs to God we belong to him that shows ownership we are in his house we're a part of his family praise the Lord that seal shows ownership look Also let's go back over well we'll just we already read it anyway in Ephesians amen signifies the price has been paid a seal also signifies a finished product amen when something's been finished it'll it'll it oftentimes it will be sealed with something whatever it is uh brother random talked about the railroad car when the the guy working the railroad car would go pack that thing just as perfect the way it's supposed to be the inspector would come by and he would look at that railroad car and he would inspect it to make sure it was packed properly so that all the packages that were inside the railroad car got to where they were going and got there safely yeah and when he looked at it and he approved it as being sufficient to be able to make its destination he put a seal on it right right and nobody was to break that seal right that seal was supposed to stay intact until that merchandise got to where it was going to its final destination amen it's show the finished product it showed that something was complete it was a completed job it was a completed work look friend when Jesus said be ye therefore perfect he wasn't meaning that you're going to be a sinless person he just meant that we need to be grown-ups that we need to be mature because the Redemptive price has been paid when God sealed you it signifies you're a finished work you belong to God in your soul now obviously we will continue to grow in Grace uh in our spirit our body the rest of our lives until the until the full payment of that Redemption that uh uh that full Redemption takes place and we receive a body change is going to be continuous growth but the seal says You Belong To Me the price has been paid this is a finished product so when you've been sealed by the holy spirit of God if you've received the new birth you recognize that God has has uh identified you as his and that you are a finished product in him you belong to him now praise the Lord a seal also represents Authority amen that puts you in a place of authority the Holy Spirit itself being a seal signifies the authority of whom the seal belongs to you'll never see well I shouldn't say never no never be unofficial speech by the president of the United States unless he's behind the podium with the Seal of the United States on the podium never now he might be walking to his helicopter or his plane or he might do some impromptu something but he never gives an official address to the public without being a Podium and a seal that through that signifies who he is right and anyone stands behind that seal that means they are representing the president they are speaking on behalf of the president whoever he is she whatever it it it it proves that's who they are that seal signifies The Authority from which they speak amen the Seal of the Holy Spirit In You signifies the authority of God from whom you speak I don't speak these things we don't speak these things of Our Own these things don't belong to us it's not ours we speak what God shows us or we keep quiet that's what brother Brandon said yeah yes amen this bride she will have thus saith the Lord or she will sit still Yes amen amen you will have thus saith the Lord from God or you will sit still that's an authority of God remember the character the the power without the character is satanic right right it takes the character of God the authority of God to prove who you belong to and of course the most important thing is that this seal of the Holy Spirit seals God in and seals the devil out right which we've already talked about no Passage through the Holy Spirit God himself in the person of Jesus Christ amen is sealed in the soul and there's no Passage pursued into your destination the devil can get in there God does not leave you amen it's at seal it's a seal that brings now there's been seals through the scripture you know before Pentecost before the Holy Ghost fell we have what we as know today as the holy spirit in our lives and and uh in the form of the holy Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit God moved on his people in different ways Pillar of Fire by the pillar of Fire by Night pillar of cloud by the day amen when God came and spoke to Abraham he did so with purpose look at this let's go to Genesis chapter 17. amen because there's there's something that is spoke of in the Old Testament that helps us recognize the Seal of the Holy Ghost of the New Testament let's look you're 17. Genesis 17 9. and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee and their Generations this is my Covenant look now this is God speaking to Abraham telling Abraham that this which he is about to announce this is my God's covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a what exactly Ruth a token amen a touchy can't understand it yet but I understand what you're saying the token it's a token the the circumcision was a token a sign a signification of a token of a covenant between us and God that token proved that there was a connection there the connection that we have today that we call the Holy Spirit and a new birth God gave to Abraham as a seal of circumcision it proved something praise the lord it's not only differentiated them from the rest of the world but it proved their obedience to God and it shown that they belong to God praise the Lord it showed and proved ownership we trust God we believe God we are his children and we do this on obedience to his word that seal of circumcision every man to be circumcised now that circumcision was simply a token praise the Lord it was a token that showed that that seal between the two had been met the Seal of authentification uh between God and Abraham had been met because of this circumcision it sealed their Covenants between him and God remember God here said and it shall be kept between me and you me and you and your seat after you it's not for everybody it was between him and God yes and look friend today it's not up to the pastor it's not up to the the parents it's not up to the world it's between you and God it is an individual affair I don't get it uh my wife doesn't get it because of me or vice versa my children didn't get it because they came from my loins right they had to get it for themselves every individual has to have it by themselves it's an individual Affair your relationship with God is Not between you and brother Brown and God and and God it's not between you and the pastor and God it's not between you and your spouse and God it's you and him and him alone yes notice and it's sitting here in thy scene after thee what seed was that of course a natural seed but also a faith Seed of Abraham notice the face seat of Abraham and those that follow along with the faith of Abraham receive circumcision as well how did we receive circumcision and it not just the males this time praise the Lord amen male female every human alike receiving by the Holy Spirit of circumcision in themselves a circumcision of the heart amen a circumcision of the heart you go back in Romans 2 29. a circumcision of the heart that does what that Spirit Cuts away all of the world is Cuts away all of the unbelief Cuts away anything that is not like God and it makes that seal a covenant between you and God a circumcision that shows that even by faith because the only way you can have it is by faith you can't receive the Holy Spirit any other way but by faith and believing trusting knowing God's promise his word is delivered to you by faith that faith of Abraham brings that Covenant that token that seal that circumcision that that uh that promise that God has given to cut away everything that's not like God what does it do it identifies you to him it separates you from the world it makes you and him in perfect relation together it brings you and him together as one what did we talk about the other day that invisible Union God and man becoming one again how because she's become the word yeah she's become the work he's the work the only way he can join together with anything is it has to be word amen you don't have relation uh man and animal producing Offspring no it takes a man and a woman it takes two humans it takes word and word to become one to produce and that production brings forth life and life proves that Covenant that Covenant this watch between us and him yeah you personally personally between you the circumcision let's go over to Romans because Roman talks now Paul talks about it to the Roman Church Romans chapter 4 verse 9. amen Romans 4 9. cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only look at now if it's some of the writings here uh can become tricky so we'll read it slowly cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness praise the Lord that's the face seed now today that we are to him yes Amen to facing that's reckoned to us for righteousness amen because we believe how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision you say well how could that be because if he had not to begin with there would have never been a circumcision you understand if he had not believed it that way when he was yet in uncircumcision he would have never circumcised because the faith wouldn't have been there to believe that that Covenant between him and God was real right had to be fake that had to be believed before there could be action so it had to come in his own circumcision that's what brought about the circumcision see because it says about the faith of Abraham that reckoned Abraham to righteousness how was it reckoned circumcision or uncircumcision not in circumcision but but in other circumcision praise the Lord the uncircumcision brought about the circumcision praise the Lord what couldn't have done it if it hadn't been and he received the sign of circumcision now he's receiving the sign of circumcision because his faith unto righteousness was already there praise God knows who is his Saints and because the Seal of that righteousness was already there God gave him this promise and all that did was bring about the actual action that caused him to circumcise the received 11th verse now he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet been uncircumcised again he had that Faith unto righteousness while he was still uncircumcised praise the Lord why do you think the Holy Spirit God gave you the Holy Spirit to begin with right because you have the faith of that truth believing it and living it and obedience before God ever gave it to you if you were not in that position he would not have given it to you to start with so your faith began to build when you were living in the world if you ever were that Faith started that process began even when you weren't serving God so that when it got to that point and that faith that promise the two became one and God filled you with his spirit praise the Lord that made you and him one that made Abraham and him and God and their Covenant won and those that were after them God only gave it to him because he uh he was already the son of righteousness by faith he had that long before the uncircumcised before the circumcision ever came you have that before God ever filled you with his spirit and you became born again you already had that Faith to righteousness after you receive D the sale then the real righteousness of God come into your life because then that made the two of you won you and him become one he's the Lord amen oh it's a beautiful thing friend this this seal so important this circumcision we talk about the Holy Spirit here for him but it was just as important to Abraham to Abraham's seed to Abraham's Faith seed was just important that Royal Seed of Abraham Jesus Christ Grace amen I love it's beautiful of the faith let's go back to 11th verse now which he had been yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they were uh though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also the righteousness of God might be imputed to them also praise the Lord to those who to those that believe it was the token that was given to them that's why brother Brown labeled when he spoke on this the four or five times he preached it the token the token the thing that's the pay the fairs the fair the pays the price has been paid amen I when I filed my job I don't I don't I don't go down there walk up to the gate and just get on the airplane the the security would be on me faster than the sun came up this morning they would they would hit me so hard and stop and say where's your ticket where has your price been paid and am I reaching my wallet and say you know I got I got credit cards here that's got thousands of dollars on them I don't necessarily but if I had I could say I I have all this money in here see y'all you just no no no no you have to go back and get your ticket right you can't buy a ticket here I don't care if you're a multi-billionaire I don't care if you're Warren Buffett Bill Gates uh Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos you got to go back to where they sell it amen yeah you have to go back to where they sell it reminds me of a story that um I've told I I'm sure I've told it here before but when I was lit when I was back in Charlotte and in business purchase manager we go on these uh trips that were uh for uh the beauty Barber Supply Institute conventions and buyer conventions and and they would always have functions and they would have dinners and they would have breakfast and they always just something to have the Pomp and Circumstances didn't mean anything didn't accomplish nothing it's just a way for a bunch of Rich companies to spend a bunch of money and live high on all but anyway one of the keynote speakers of I forgot breakfast dinner I can't remember one of them was Colin Powell which was an honor to meet the man um uh anyway I won't get into anything else but it was honor to meet you man he came up he was the keynote speaker very brilliant Oh my he was he he could have been an incredible president actually but um uh brilliant man but he gave the keynote speak and he told a story at the end that everybody found comical but I found very enlightening he talked about one time where he was at an event like that he was sitting at dinner some of you may have heard the story from me forgive me if you have to hear it again he was sitting at dinner in the same type Forum with a group of people and it was filled the room was filled and you know when you've got 200 people in a room and a bunch of round tables you got waiters and waitresses going all over the place they're giving out drinks and they're giving out food and they're doing all this just as fast as they can do it going around everything and everybody and all talking and hanging out around and you know they're they're busy doing all this and the already that they could keep any organization there is when you came in you have to have you had to have a ticket to be able to get the meal uh you couldn't just come in as uh as an occupant of the hotel and just sit down at a chair and expect to get a steak dinner didn't work that way you had to have a ticket if you belong to that group or to that uh uh facility place that that it that was holding it they gave you something to show I belong to so-and-so company okay so they came around and they they passed out the food and uh she kept the the waitress kept skipping Colin Powell and went around and I I can't remember the whole story but soup and salad and whatever else and it came to main course and he kept looking around saying where's my food what's going on here and the man next to him finally spoke up and he said excuse me a minute ma'am he said this man has been set here this whole time and you haven't given him a single bite of food you haven't served him anything and he said do you not know who this man is this man is Colin Powell he's our speaker for today he's the he's I believe at the time he was the uh uh the uh uh the chairman of the joint Chief of Staff he answered directly to the president United States this man answers directly to the president of the United States is the chairman of the joint Chief of Staff this is Colin Powell she looked at that man and said I don't care who he is he didn't have a ticket amen she said she literally her job was to make sure whoever she served had to have a ticket she said I don't care who he is he didn't have a ticket and everybody laughed but I looked at it I thought my isn't that the truth people who can yell and scream and they can do all they want and say they're Christians and shout and scream and cry and raise their hands and however speak in tongues they want to but friend without that token you're not going anywhere am I amen Colin Powell wasn't gonna get one single bite of food because you didn't have a ticket didn't matter who he was you can go to that gate and you could have 80 billion dollars but you can't buy a ticket at the gate you've got to go back where they sell them isn't that what Jesus told them the the foolish virgins when they found out that they didn't have oil in their vessels and they came in onto those that were burning and they said hey give us of yours ours has run out they said we can't do that you got to go where they sell it yeah amen that's the only way you can to be able to possess the token you have to get it from the token seller the only way to get a plane ticket is to go to the place that sells the ticket you can't do it get on and say hey pilot here uh here's my money no it doesn't work that way neither does it work that way with God amen without the token without the ticket you're not going to go and that's the bottom line amen look one more of course the world let's go to Joshua for a moment the world's stolen God's token but that doesn't make it God's token any less amen even if the world has taken the that rainbow token that God gave to us of his promise even if the world's tried to steal it doesn't matter it still belongs to us still belongs to God it's still his token amen regardless of whoever wants to hijack it it still belongs to God it's still God's rainbow yes amen praise the Lord it is a read just thinking of that a racing is a token amen a seal if you will a token it shows that I belong to somebody in marriage right and she's sitting right over there she's got one just like it it shows that she belongs to me we're together in marriage it's a union that's a bond that will last through eternity as far as I'm concerned right amen may not be a marriage like we know it today but through eternity She's mine I'm hers that's that's the way it is for me and I'm glad it's that way but it's a token amen it's a signification it's a Signet that shows yeah I used to do the signets back in the 18th century people especially of renown would write a letter and scroll it up and put some wax on it and put a seal on it a bee or something bin it this is this came from this uh family and it's it's a the utmost importance it gets to where it's going yes and that Ryder puts his pouch and takes it to it amen and that recipient gets it and says oh my this is from the Bennetts I better open this because it signified something amen that's just a seal now one more let's we'll uh quit after this we'll close in Joshua chapter 2 I want to read verse 21. 2 21. now we have Rahab I was reading this again and you know we get some stigmas and and be careful about what I'm saying because I don't mean this in the wrong way but we get certain certain stigmas about things that only God can only do something a certain way God can only do operate by his word amen but I want you to know when Joshua and and the Army went to go take over Jericho um which was walled by walls that were so thick brother random said three chariots could run a race on top side by side if the walls were so big and houses were on the wall and they sent a couple of spies in to spy out Jericho and they came into a Harless house I'm thinking why in the world with these two Godly men find residents in a Harlan's house and then I thought or the lord gave it to me what better place to hide if two strange men came into a city and they went and as normal would be people look at them and say Hey you know these guys they don't belong here they're not part of this city they're not my family they're your family you know so I'm Batman but two strange men going into a Harvard's house nobody think anything about it amen you could go Incognito because they wouldn't think anything about strange men going into an Harlan's house amen and it's exactly what they did these spies went into a Harlan's house Rahab the Harlot went into her house and as they spied out the land they found out the two men were there anyway but Rahab hid them and said from the guys that was trying to get to them and she said now we know that your God is God he's God of heaven and he's god of Earth what will you do for me in my house now that I've showed you this kindness and hid you and kept you from them getting to you or killing you or capturing you and let's read uh verse 12 let's start here now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that he will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token a sign a seal a Signet and that you will save a life my father and my mother and my brother and my sisters and all that they have and and deliver our lives from death and you don't you want to worry about your family amen put them under the token amen Rahab the Harlot because of her kindness to Joshua's Army was under that token yes and she didn't just want to be under the token she brought her whole family under that boat yeah yeah so no no damage nothing harmful was going to come to any of her family praise the Lord oh friend I always loved God's promises amen amen they have my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answer her our life for yours if he utter not this our business and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by a court through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain unless the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned in a way and afterward may go your way go uh ye go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us to swear behold when we come into the land Thou shalt uh bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou Hast uh did US let down uh let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father thy mother thy brother and all thy Father's House home unto thee and it shall be the whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be uh with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon Him notices very similar to what they did with the Paschal Lamb amen you had to be under the token had to be in the home where the blood was shed amen you had to be in the home for the promise to be effective you had to be in the household couldn't be outside you had to be in the house and if thou utter this our business then we will quit of art of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she said according unto your word so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the Scarlet line in the window the Scarlet line in the winter and they went and came unto the mountain and both there three days until the sewers returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over uh came to Josh with the son of none and told all things that befell them so on and so forth and the token the stream the cord that was let down was the thing that signified it was the seal the token that let them know that this is the woman's house of whom is safe from any route of the children of Israel right her and that house there on that on that wall amen now Al how unless I've missed something in the scripture how that house survived the falling of the wall I'll I don't know amen now we know the wall fell flat to the ground had to because they marched right into the City and took over the wall didn't crumble down where they had to crawl over a bunch of Boulders and stuff just to try to get into the city but while the Bible says the Wall fall flat and they walk right in at her house is on the town wall but God kept them yes God saved him and Joshua and his army did nothing hurtful to her and her family because they were under the token she brought them by the promise under the token yes that was signified by a stream so notice it could be literally anything that signifies a promise a wedding ring back in the Old Testament was a was a crown like that a woman wore that had tokens in them remember the woman who had lost one of them which would signify she had been unfaithful she searched that house up one side down the other she counted the ants the dust bunnies and everything that was in that home because she had to find that token before her husband came home amen or he would have got rid of her it's a lot of things signified a token Signet a seal the Seal of the Holy Spirit but you know how it binds itself together that's how perfect the word is people will say that there's the word is fallible the word is contradictions the word is the Bible does so-and-so friend every bit of it if you have a revelation of what God's word is and what it speaks to you there's not one single contradiction in here amen not one single thing in here contradicts the other it might contradict your opinion it might contradict your education it might contradict your science but it does not contradict itself right amen it is perfect in continuity together beautiful the way God brings it all together to help us realize what it really means to us to be sealed of the Holy Spirit amen amen the token also as we close separates the True Believer from the unbeliever and make-believer yes amen it separates it brings a division it brings a point of of a Chasm between the two amen belief and unbelief being yoked together has to be something of faith of this token that brings the two together it brings the separation it shows because you're not like them you're different you're bought with the price you belong to God amen amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could praise the Lord the Seal of the Holy Spirit without it friend it means nothing all that we go through everything that happens in this life what is it if it wasn't God sealing us showing we belong to him amen we're a part of him we're a part of that family we're one of them amen praise the Lord one of them we belong to god let's sing that song if we could it's 151 in the book we'll have it here on the screen amen I probably won't sing all the verses but a couple of verses here this thing is one of them maybe you sing it you believe you're one of them praise the Lord if you're not you can be I believe you can't be anyway amen let's take it now there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all the flame we're the fire that they'll let me know I Wanna Dance [Music] oh I'm so glad that I can say I Wanna Dance [Music] [Music] he'll do for us amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] like this yeah one more time [Music] [Applause] amen amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord aren't you glad you can say you're one of them today yes sir hallelujah thank you Jesus oh my friend if that token's not there we can say all we want but we're not one of them amen or one of those amen one of them or one of those I want to be one of them praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus with that token that Holy Spirit with that seal of Promise amen he's made us one with him he not only joined us with him but that same Spirit has joined us together praise the lord we are joined together by that one promise just like it bound to Abraham and God's promise it was to his seed to him the family of God joined together as the same seal praise the Lord one together with the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord God bless you I pray something was said to Blessings bring to you today amen help you in some way speak to our hearts amen just grow in the Lord amen God's been so good to us amen next Sunday now I'm I'm driving back to El Paso again so I'm driving so it has no effect on the service but now August 6th I'll say it again before it gets here but August 6th I'll need to move it up again the service if it's okay uh uh half hour 30 minutes if that works okay so let's go back to Pennsylvania uh for the month of August so that week the flight leaves at like 1 20 so there's nothing it's amazing the way the airlines are getting it's amazing how much they're changing stuff and for some reason afternoon flights two three o'clock flights out of Tucson are just they're just going away they're getting less let's just put it that way so we'll just see whatever the Lord has planned it'll get better when the time changes back they just leave it alone uh just put it like it's supposed to be if we were on mountain time it would be okay but anyway so next on next couple of Sundays everything's fine but just in the back your mind August 6th I'll announce again we'll probably be pushed up a half hour or so um so remember that in prayer I appreciate that and again continue to remind you about that the 20th is sketchy so we'll see about that uh what happens on August 20th it got us scheduled out further than we normally are now so uh it's kind of different but um I uh I'll be glad this coming week to get some rest hopefully I appreciate each one of your prayers it means a lot to me it really does and I know I'm on the road and I know I'm digging deep for that last minute of energy and I know you're praying it makes it a big difference anyone else have anything in your heart before we go I know I know since Michaela brought it up now I
