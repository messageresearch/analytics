[2:05] make mention to you um
[2:08] we have uh one from brother danny of
[2:11] course he had mentioned before about his
[2:13] sons
[2:14] uh it just seems like there's outside
[2:16] interference trying to influence his
[2:17] sons away from him
[2:18] and he really wants the lord's
[2:20] intervention on that so
[2:22] just pray the lord would have his way in
[2:23] that situation
[2:25] sister norma also request prayer for his
[2:27] grant for her grandson
[2:29] he'd come to tucson but his transmission
[2:31] went on his truck
[2:32] and uh she wants the lord to just
[2:34] intervene somehow make a way to get his
[2:36] transmission fixed so
[2:37] he can get back home uh with his truck
[2:41] so i appreciate the lord and trust in
[2:44] the lord would be
[2:45] upon that also uh sister sheila sent a
[2:48] prayer request
[2:49] for her son dominic her brother harlan
[2:52] and of course she wanted to mention that
[2:53] alice
[2:54] uh alice's birthday is tomorrow
[2:57] so um happy birthday to alice
[3:04] will be three tomorrow so happy birthday
[3:07] alice god bless you
[3:08] um so thankful that the lord has blessed
[3:11] a
[3:12] nice healthy couple of years for her i
[3:15] also found out this week that
[3:18] my old church back in north carolina
[3:20] brother richard boatwright
[3:21] has um have gotten had gotten someone in
[3:24] the church that had
[3:26] coveted and
[3:29] it had spread in the church so there's
[3:31] several members there that
[3:33] that have coveted so i would ask that
[3:35] you pray with them
[3:36] uh the church name is king's tabernacle
[3:38] and the
[3:39] ones there i don't even know who all has
[3:42] it uh but just remember them in prayer
[3:44] if you would i'm sorry this uh
[3:46] encoding thing i don't know what that is
[3:48] is gonna keep this buffering so i
[3:50] sincerely apologize hopefully the audio
[3:53] will come through if the video doesn't
[3:54] drive you crazy
[3:56] freezing and letting go so hopefully the
[3:58] audio will be a good stream you can
[4:00] listen because that's really the main
[4:02] part of this anyway
[4:03] but i do apologize for that um
[4:06] anyway so brother uh so remember that in
[4:09] prayer if you would
[4:10] also brother dave williamson just sent
[4:13] me a prayer request
[4:14] pray for danielle um now
[4:17] excuse me because i haven't read through
[4:18] this yet she has a complicated pregnancy
[4:21] she's facing a potential
[4:23] risky surgery today for a
[4:26] placenta something her placenta has
[4:28] grown through her uterine wall she's
[4:31] having contractions
[4:32] uh if delivery begins she could lead to
[4:35] death
[4:35] and not sure the two-month plus
[4:38] premature baby
[4:39] would survive the delivery so her name
[4:42] is danielle i'm assuming it's probably
[4:44] a client of uh brother dave so if you
[4:47] remember that in prayer too
[4:49] for this danielle i heard back from
[4:51] several of my friends as you all know
[4:53] the
[4:54] hurricane just went up through a a major
[4:57] swath of louisiana and i have a lot of
[4:59] friends and of course brother pat
[5:01] has uh his daughter rachel there and and
[5:04] shreveport or
[5:05] uh vulgar city or boger city blues
[5:08] bossier city uh they're in
[5:10] uh shreveport and of course that's you
[5:12] most of you probably know austin that's
[5:14] where they live
[5:15] uh but i've heard from several of them
[5:18] they're doing good
[5:19] the lord blessed them and they have
[5:21] power out of course but
[5:22] uh no injuries no deaths and
[5:25] they're all doing very well the ones
[5:27] i've heard from anyway so
[5:29] i'm very thankful for that god was
[5:31] merciful to them
[5:32] even in lake charles i i knew some older
[5:35] couple that
[5:36] i visited the churches up there and came
[5:39] and heard me minister and was
[5:40] fellowshipping with them
[5:42] um there in lake charles right where the
[5:44] hurricane hit so
[5:46] um all is well and we're thankful that
[5:48] god bless them and
[5:49] and was with them so just remember these
[5:52] requests of course
[5:53] uh there's several people as we know uh
[5:56] back at brother donnie reagan's church
[5:57] that had contracted coveted including
[5:59] brother donnie
[6:00] brother daryl ward uh brother terry
[6:03] tittle his wife
[6:04] uh brother daryl ward's son was actually
[6:06] taking care of him and his
[6:08] brother daryl's wife was taking care of
[6:10] him then she got it he was taking care
[6:13] of her
[6:13] and now the son has it and so just
[6:16] remember them all in prayer
[6:18] uh this whole thing we're just trusting
[6:20] the lord's intervention and god bless
[6:22] them and
[6:23] and bring perfect complete healing in
[6:25] every situation so
[6:26] we know god is mindful amen and god is

[12:56] buffering a little bit but we're just
[12:57] going to keep pressing on and
[12:59] trust the lord's going to bless today so
[13:01] we're again on the
[13:02] mysteries of god in christ this will be
[13:04] part 12 is also having the preeminence
[13:07] in his people god having the primitives
[13:08] and his people this is part 4.
[13:10] so we'll go back to revelation chapter
[13:12] 10 verse 7
[13:14] where we are with the mysteries of god
[13:15] in christ as we begin our scripture
[13:18] reading here but in the days of the
[13:19] voice of the seventh angel
[13:21] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[13:23] of god should be finished as he had
[13:25] declared to his servants the prophets
[13:27] i want you again to remember that
[13:29] mystery of god
[13:31] and the contrasting of mystery singular
[13:34] of god and mysteries plural of god if
[13:36] you may have missed this or not seen
[13:38] this up to this point
[13:39] mysteries of god the mystery of god
[13:42] being the revelation of jesus christ
[13:44] which has gone through the past two
[13:46] weekends
[13:47] of going into the scripture that that
[13:49] foundation
[13:50] of that church is laid upon the
[13:52] revelation of who jesus
[13:53] is that mystery of god was to be
[13:56] finished
[13:57] the completion of that in the bride
[13:59] today that's how she
[14:00] becomes that preeminent in her to
[14:03] fulfill that complete expression of
[14:05] jesus christ upon this earth today
[14:08] uh and he in in containing in jesus
[14:11] is the mysteries plural all the things
[14:14] that's been left out and
[14:16] tied up at this last day as that prophet
[14:18] of god brother brown took those loose
[14:20] ends tied them all together
[14:22] that's those mysteries well every bit of
[14:24] it's tied up in the mystery of god
[14:26] that was finished in that present day
[14:28] truth and
[14:29] that messenger brought to us no doubt it
[14:31] was all through the church ages of
[14:32] course we know
[14:33] and everyone played their part and it
[14:35] just happens to be that we're here at
[14:37] the end time and
[14:38] we're here at the end part of this we're
[14:39] going to finish this up by the grace of
[14:41] god and his help and of course the
[14:43] rapture culminating
[14:44] so as we're on part four of uh
[14:47] god having the preeminence in his people
[14:50] i want to go back to that subtitle verse
[14:52] that i want to read in colossians
[14:54] chapter one again
[14:55] colossians chapter one and maybe this
[14:58] one and maybe one more
[14:59] lord willing and we'll be live in our
[15:01] church next sunday lord willing
[15:03] um i want to finish this part of it up
[15:05] and then we'll get into that last part
[15:07] and see where the lord takes it from
[15:09] there so uh
[15:11] first uh colossians chapter 1 verse 17
[15:13] and he
[15:14] is before all things jesus christ before
[15:16] all things
[15:17] and by him all things consist or stand
[15:21] they still stand today and he is jesus
[15:24] is the head of the body the church who
[15:27] is the beginning
[15:29] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[15:32] things he might have the preeminence for
[15:34] it please to follow that in him
[15:36] should all fullness dwell and remember
[15:38] went into that uh
[15:39] foundation of course we started with the
[15:42] beginning of the creation of god jesus
[15:44] revelation 3
[15:45] 14 i believe it is and got into uh the
[15:49] body the foundation
[15:50] foundation this church is built upon and
[15:53] last week we started building that body
[15:55] off of that foundation
[15:56] and seeing in a couple scriptures but of
[15:59] course first corinthians 12
[16:01] jesus building that body and this body
[16:03] being fit and joined together
[16:05] and we are all part of the same mystical
[16:08] body of jesus christ
[16:09] internationally around the world we are
[16:12] all a part of that same
[16:13] mystical body of jesus christ we are one
[16:15] in him
[16:16] as that body as he is that that head of
[16:19] that cornerstone he is the foundation
[16:22] stone of this building of this church of
[16:24] this bride
[16:25] and he is the capstone that also being
[16:28] the
[16:29] beginning and the finishing the author
[16:31] and the finisher the alpha and omega
[16:33] he is the one that is our completeness
[16:36] and in him
[16:36] is that mysteries amen that's contained
[16:39] in the scripture that we see
[16:40] so we'll continue on as we've built up
[16:43] this body now
[16:45] that god has the preeminence in see we
[16:47] got to create that foundation first
[16:49] remember how important that foundation
[16:51] is we read last week
[16:52] how important that foundation is baptism
[16:55] is good reading your bible is great
[16:57] going to church is fantastic all
[16:59] that is is essential to a christian all
[17:02] of it
[17:02] must be done but unless you've got that
[17:05] right foundation
[17:07] then all the rest of it's just uh deeds
[17:10] that we do
[17:11] see just all deeds becomes something it
[17:14] means something it's meaningful to us
[17:16] when we know that we have that
[17:17] foundation that is built on the
[17:19] revelation of who jesus christ
[17:22] is again i'm going to say this he's not
[17:23] the second person of a godhead
[17:26] of a trinity excuse me he's not the
[17:28] second person of a trinity
[17:30] he's not some great prophet or something
[17:32] he is
[17:33] he is god almighty veiled in flesh so
[17:36] the revelation is built upon that and
[17:38] then
[17:39] and him having the preeminence as the
[17:41] head of this body
[17:43] has the preeminence in our lives if he
[17:45] doesn't have the preeminence then
[17:47] there's no way that this brian
[17:49] can fulfill the expression that jesus
[17:51] has called her for
[17:52] in this last day she's fulfilling that
[17:55] expression for that purpose
[17:57] that's why we're here that's our point
[17:59] of being here now
[18:00] i want to go and build on that hit a
[18:03] couple of nuances that i want to talk
[18:05] about here
[18:06] in the scripture today so in first peter
[18:09] chapter 2 uh i want to begin
[18:13] today to to start our foundation on
[18:16] the scripture and the message for today
[18:18] uh first peter chapter two
[18:21] uh we'll just begin with verse one first
[18:23] peter two one
[18:25] let's read it here wherefore laying
[18:28] aside
[18:28] all malice and all guile and hypocrisies
[18:32] and envies and all evil speakings as
[18:35] newborn babes desired a sincere milk of
[18:38] the word that ye may grow thereby
[18:40] grow thereby see if the if so
[18:44] be have tasted that the lord is gracious
[18:48] to whom coming listen now it's where i
[18:51] want to get to
[18:51] to whom coming of course we know
[18:54] he has been here and yet he is coming
[18:57] right
[18:58] and he's coming to take a bride home
[19:00] we're going to meet him
[19:02] in the air praise the lord that
[19:04] dissension of christ
[19:06] and the ascension of the bride as we
[19:08] meet him in the air
[19:09] to go to the lord's supper as to whom
[19:12] coming
[19:12] as unto a living stone
[19:16] amen a living stone is that living stone
[19:20] he was crucified he was buried he but he
[19:23] resurrected on the third day
[19:24] and he is that living stone that was
[19:28] disallowed we talked about indeed of men
[19:31] who is those men the builders those who
[19:33] are responsible for building
[19:35] uh the spiritual house by which jesus
[19:39] was to be the inhabiter of
[19:41] that was their purpose but they
[19:43] disallowed him
[19:45] they again put him at not set him aside
[19:49] worthless is how they declared him they
[19:51] took a
[19:52] thief over jesus christ the religious
[19:55] leader screamed out for barabbas
[19:57] a thief and a murder over jesus christ
[20:01] they disallowed indeed a man but he's
[20:03] chosen of god
[20:05] amen he was chosen of god but look
[20:09] not only was jesus chosen of god but
[20:12] those who come from him
[20:13] were chosen of god if you were from
[20:16] christ which we'll get to a little bit
[20:18] later
[20:18] if you are from christ you were chosen
[20:20] in god as well
[20:21] god chose you god hand picked you
[20:25] god deliberately wanted you and called
[20:28] you
[20:28] from his mind from before the foundation
[20:30] of the world as a part of him
[20:32] he called you as a part of him
[20:35] you are chosen you are uh
[20:39] in him from the beginning there was no
[20:41] beginning
[20:42] all the way back before there was a
[20:44] beginning you were in him
[20:46] so yes jesus was chosen look he was
[20:49] disallowing men but he was chosen of god
[20:51] and he is precious
[20:52] amen we've gotten to know how precious
[20:54] he is of course but i want you to know
[20:56] that you're chosen of god too
[20:58] as we keep reading listen now ye also
[21:02] amen has lively stones now what is that
[21:06] lively see that
[21:07] lively again here we got is is quickened
[21:10] or
[21:10] made alive see ephesians 2 told us that
[21:14] we were once
[21:15] dead in our sins we were dead
[21:18] in our sins see but the word
[21:22] quickened us made us alive now we are
[21:25] living stones we are lively stones
[21:28] we're not dead anymore we're not dead in
[21:31] sin we're dead
[21:32] to sin now see the difference of being a
[21:35] christian or not being a christian is
[21:37] if the non-christian he's still dead in
[21:39] his sin
[21:40] so he's dead but the christian is dead
[21:43] to sin
[21:44] she has nothing more to do with sin
[21:47] blessed is the man to whom god will not
[21:49] impute sin
[21:51] praise the lord oh i just love it now
[21:55] i don't know that we'll be able to do it
[21:57] today but next week
[21:58] getting to who we are friend you got
[22:00] this has got to bring you some faith
[22:03] this is this has got to bring faith to
[22:05] this pride to help us see
[22:06] see who we are who god has chose us to
[22:09] be
[22:09] it's not it wasn't something that we
[22:12] manufactured are made of god did this
[22:15] and he did it to you and for you because
[22:17] of who you are
[22:18] he chose you see we
[22:21] are lively stones quicken
[22:25] god with his holy spirit come into you
[22:28] who were once dead
[22:29] in sin that holy spirit come into you
[22:33] and made you alive quickened you
[22:36] as a lively stone you're a part of that
[22:39] building aren't you
[22:41] well amen a lot of these stone are built
[22:44] up
[22:44] a spiritual house now we of course like
[22:47] i said last week are
[22:48] individually built up a spiritual house
[22:51] for
[22:51] the indwelling presence of jesus christ
[22:54] as we
[22:54] individually are we are as a body of
[22:57] believers
[22:58] as each one is in its place each
[23:01] placement is building up the entire body
[23:04] we make up the mystical body of jesus
[23:06] christ but we're still the inhabitation
[23:09] of the holy spirit jesus christ
[23:13] built up a spiritual house a holy
[23:15] priesthood
[23:17] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[23:20] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[23:23] we are to offer spiritual sacrifices
[23:27] that's acceptable to god those spiritual
[23:31] sacrifices that god has given
[23:33] us to be able to offer up i was
[23:35] challenged one time
[23:38] about the old testament some of you may
[23:41] know this
[23:42] and it's nobody in our church okay so
[23:44] but
[23:45] one time i was challenged about the old
[23:48] testament
[23:49] i said absolutely believe the old
[23:51] testament as much as i do it
[23:52] foreshadowed
[23:53] the new it brought forth the things that
[23:56] god was doing then
[23:57] and and just transferred it over when
[23:59] the blood of jesus christ
[24:01] christ came in the blood of jesus christ
[24:03] was
[24:05] he said well you still offer up
[24:07] sacrifice do you still sacrifice it
[24:09] absolutely
[24:10] of course we do of course the mindset
[24:13] there was
[24:14] the sacrifice of bull and goats and and
[24:17] and live animals that we take and slit
[24:19] our throats
[24:20] well no we don't do that but we are a
[24:23] holy priesthood
[24:25] offering up spiritual sacrifices
[24:29] god transformed it away from the blood
[24:32] of bulls and goats
[24:34] over to the blood of jesus christ now
[24:37] people have a hard time understanding
[24:39] that people stumble at that because
[24:41] because
[24:42] they don't understand why the blood why
[24:45] does it have to be such a mess well the
[24:47] blood is where the life is
[24:49] the blood is where the life is see you
[24:52] say well if you take the
[24:53] heart out you'll die of course you take
[24:55] the liver out or the kidneys or the
[24:57] brain
[24:58] and that's true but you can have every
[25:01] single organ in your body working
[25:03] absolutely perfect and not one speck of
[25:07] thing wrong with
[25:07] any organ in your body but if you take
[25:10] the blood out
[25:11] you're gonna die because the life is in
[25:14] the blood
[25:16] and see god knows that when he did that
[25:18] of course we created us
[25:20] put that life in us that life is in the
[25:23] blood the life of the body
[25:24] it's in the blood so when that blood was
[25:27] shed it was the representation of the
[25:29] life the blood cells was broke that
[25:31] released
[25:32] god when when the blood cell of christ
[25:34] was broke it released god
[25:36] see because that life is in that blood
[25:39] so it had to be that blood yeah
[25:40] one time they offered those bulls and
[25:42] goats and that's what was acceptable to
[25:44] god
[25:44] but no longer because the perfect
[25:47] sacrifice the lamb of god came
[25:49] and shed his blood and when that blood
[25:51] was shed
[25:53] we now offer up spiritual sacrifices of
[25:56] praise to our lord
[25:58] for what he's done for us that's the
[26:00] spiritual sacrifice
[26:01] as a holy priesthood that's not just a
[26:04] minister
[26:05] that's not just a man that's the bride
[26:08] that's all of us collectively as a bride
[26:10] internationally we all offer up
[26:13] spiritual sacrifices to the lord
[26:15] praising him worshiping him glorifying
[26:18] him
[26:19] living a life that's pleasing to him
[26:22] that's worshiping god when you go out
[26:24] and you live a life and you look like a
[26:26] christian you act like a christian you
[26:27] talk like a christian
[26:28] according to god's word you're
[26:31] worshiping the lord
[26:32] you're showing forth those spiritual
[26:35] sacrifices
[26:37] people may call you names and sell kind
[26:39] of things about us
[26:40] or the sisters or whatever you're
[26:42] offering up spiritual sacrifices to the
[26:44] lord
[26:45] when you walk in the walmart looking the
[26:47] way you do
[26:48] when you walk into the stores and
[26:51] grocery stores
[26:52] and places of in public you're offering
[26:55] spiritual sacrifices
[26:57] you're showing that you're a holy
[26:59] priesthood you're not belong to this
[27:01] world you don't belong to the devil
[27:03] you belong to god you're a lively stone
[27:06] you're no more dead in sin
[27:08] you're a lively stone that's coming
[27:10] offering spiritual sacrifice
[27:12] because you're a holy priesthood
[27:15] you're a minister your life preaches
[27:19] everywhere you go your life preaches to
[27:21] everybody
[27:22] amen i'm so thankful we still do all for
[27:27] spiritual sacrifices saints
[27:29] we still do offer sacrifices it's just
[27:32] not the slitting of the throats the
[27:34] bulls and dogs anymore
[27:35] amen but it's still that the transfer
[27:39] the blood of jesus christ and it's
[27:41] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[27:44] it's acceptable to god now because it's
[27:46] through jesus christ
[27:48] the bulls and goats one day was
[27:50] acceptable to god but it wasn't through
[27:52] jesus christ
[27:53] now it's through jesus christ which is
[27:55] our lord and savior and through
[27:56] him becomes acceptable so now we don't
[27:59] have to
[28:00] do the bulls and goats this is the more
[28:04] perfect sacrifice amen sixth verse
[28:07] wherefore
[28:08] also it is contained in the scripture
[28:10] behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone
[28:14] elect precious and he that believeth on
[28:17] him shall not be confounded
[28:19] we believe on him see again laid in zion
[28:23] that chief cornerstone elected precious
[28:27] unto you therefore which believe he is
[28:29] precious and i do
[28:31] do you amen do you today believe he is
[28:34] precious
[28:35] amen therefore believe that he is
[28:37] precious but unto them which be
[28:39] disobedient the stone which the builders
[28:41] disallowed
[28:43] the same has made the head at the corner
[28:44] there we go again it's another place it
[28:47] tells us
[28:48] the builders rejected it the the
[28:51] the christian leaders of the world today
[28:54] many of them
[28:55] have rejected it the message came
[28:58] the message came to the united states it
[29:01] came through a humble
[29:02] uh uh kentuckian
[29:07] little ruddy man that wasn't much to
[29:11] look at
[29:12] but when he came forth with the word of
[29:14] god when god
[29:15] moved in his life friend
[29:19] everything had to stop back up because
[29:22] of what god had given to that man
[29:24] amen that prophet of god that god did
[29:27] here in america
[29:28] by how many people accept it today how
[29:31] many people
[29:32] believe it today it's been rejected
[29:35] jesus christ was rejected it was
[29:38] rejected then rejected by many down
[29:41] through the church ages
[29:42] rejected here at this last day jesus
[29:46] christ being rejected friend leaves one
[29:48] thing and that's judgment
[29:49] god help us that's where we are the
[29:52] builders disallowed the same
[29:54] jesus christ made it ahead of the corner
[29:56] and a stone of stumbling
[29:58] and a rock of offense even to them which
[30:00] stumbled at the word being disobedient
[30:03] whereunto also they were appointed
[30:05] because they have no revelation
[30:08] they have accepted a denomination
[30:10] they've accepted a seminary's teaching
[30:12] they've accepted
[30:13] some man's interpretation instead of the
[30:16] revelation of jesus christ and the word
[30:19] they've accepted some free god trinity
[30:21] explanation of being one god
[30:23] instead of realizing that he is one
[30:26] father son holy spirit is the same
[30:29] triune
[30:30] body a godhead of god himself
[30:34] he's not three he's one and they've
[30:37] rejected that
[30:39] that it becomes a rock of offense to
[30:41] them it's a stumbling stone they don't
[30:43] understand it
[30:44] but it has to come by revelation people
[30:47] reject revelation you remember the story
[30:49] of course brother brown told
[30:50] he met that guy and he said brother
[30:52] brown told him it's got to be
[30:53] it's got to be revealed to you he said
[30:55] well i reject revelation he said
[30:57] you reject god because the bible says
[31:00] you can't even believe him unless
[31:02] by the revelation of jesus christ you
[31:05] can't believe he exists but by the
[31:06] revelation
[31:08] amen got to believe who he is and even
[31:11] to them which
[31:11] they stumble at the word being
[31:13] disobedient where unto
[31:15] also they were appointed disobedient
[31:19] living in darkness and then trying to
[31:22] remember we get to darkness here
[31:24] people you know john 3 says that people
[31:27] love the darkness rather than the light
[31:29] that came to me this week
[31:30] the light came
[31:33] and it was like a revelation
[31:36] and i thought people are the way they
[31:38] are because they live in darkness
[31:40] they can't see that they're in the
[31:42] darkness
[31:43] because everything that's around them is
[31:46] dark
[31:47] that's all they can see darkness covered
[31:49] the earth grows darkness the people
[31:52] well they're in darkness they don't see
[31:54] because they're in darkness
[31:56] but they're darkness because they want
[31:58] to be in darkness they have
[32:00] chose their path they have chose their
[32:02] way and their destination
[32:04] and it is dark and they can't see
[32:07] because all that's around them is dark
[32:10] everybody tries to change those things
[32:13] but you can't unless the light comes
[32:15] and they receive the light
[32:18] those are the children of disobedience
[32:23] ninth verse but ye amen here we go again
[32:25] now see
[32:26] to this to this bride to us but ye are a
[32:29] chosen generation
[32:31] amen what i tell you we know we're
[32:34] chosen
[32:34] god chose us a chosen generation
[32:38] a royal priesthood now was a holy
[32:40] priesthood
[32:41] yeah it says a royal priesthood
[32:44] well holy priesthood of course is holy
[32:47] righteous
[32:48] uh royal is is his kingdomship
[32:52] is a rulership amen a royal
[32:56] someone who is a of a royal family
[32:59] the king queen princess whatever
[33:02] they belong to um a family
[33:06] that's that's forgive me but that family
[33:09] is an elite group
[33:11] because they're chosen by god it wasn't
[33:14] because you were born into a certain
[33:16] name of
[33:17] branham family or bennett family or
[33:20] jones or brown or
[33:21] john's or whatever it's not because
[33:23] you're born into
[33:24] that natural name family but we're a
[33:26] part of the family of god
[33:29] we've taken on his name we've taken on
[33:32] his characteristics
[33:34] we've taken on the mind of christ the
[33:36] mind of christ
[33:38] reflects christ because we do what he
[33:41] what that mind would do the only way you
[33:44] can have it is because you know the word
[33:46] by the word by the spirit of royal
[33:48] priesthood
[33:50] well of course it's royal why because
[33:52] god chose you
[33:54] well if he's the supreme if he's the
[33:57] preeminent then those who he chose
[34:01] have to be royalty because he chose them
[34:04] we're a part of his family a holy nation
[34:08] a peculiar people
[34:11] a peculiar people that ye should
[34:15] show forth the praises of him who called
[34:18] you out of darkness into the
[34:20] marvelous light see again
[34:23] you that you should show forth the
[34:25] praises of him what is that
[34:26] that that's what we just read over here
[34:28] in the fifth verse that's spiritual
[34:30] sacrifices
[34:32] we're to offer up spirits as a holy
[34:34] person all from spiritual sacrifices
[34:37] well we're a whole a royal priesthood
[34:39] holy nation
[34:40] peculiar people show forth the praises
[34:43] of him
[34:44] that's our spiritual sacrifices we our
[34:47] spiritual facts sacrifices
[34:49] are our praises to him not just that you
[34:52] go
[34:52] into church with some emotion it's not
[34:55] just that
[34:57] it seems like that people think
[35:01] things are better when they're louder
[35:03] and they're not
[35:04] just just because uh you know
[35:08] you you can go to a ball game or
[35:10] something and the louder they get that
[35:12] you think the better the game
[35:13] is you go to a church you think oh the
[35:16] louder the people the better the church
[35:17] service not necessarily
[35:20] might be but not necessarily
[35:24] noise doesn't equal it doesn't equate
[35:26] the same
[35:27] see but our praises come from our hearts
[35:31] our praises come from our life and we
[35:34] show forth those praises
[35:36] who call us out of darkness into that
[35:39] marvelous light
[35:40] well anybody that's in that darkness
[35:42] that would choose and decide and want
[35:45] to be called by god into that marvelous
[35:47] light can enter into that light
[35:50] if they want to be in that light but
[35:53] they choose darkness
[35:55] john 3 they prefer darkness over the
[35:57] light but god has called us out of that
[35:59] darkness
[36:00] we're no longer dead in sin we're dead
[36:03] to sin
[36:04] and now walking in the light of jesus
[36:06] christ walking in the light of the
[36:08] gospel of the word
[36:10] in that marvelous light which in time
[36:13] pass we're not a people but now
[36:17] the people of god which have um
[36:21] the people of god which had not obtained
[36:24] mercy
[36:24] but now have obtained mercy because
[36:28] we're the people of life
[36:30] we're we're a royal priesthood we're a
[36:32] holy generation
[36:34] we're a holy nation see as one
[36:38] remember that body is not just body
[36:41] here is as literal my body
[36:45] but body adjective figurative
[36:49] a body internationally a many member
[36:52] body
[36:53] once that was in one man jesus christ
[36:56] but when christ died and rose again and
[36:59] came back
[37:00] he came back and split himself through
[37:02] the spirit part
[37:04] into a many member body and from that
[37:07] 120
[37:08] it's gone out around the world and
[37:10] there's
[37:11] i don't know how many now thousands
[37:13] millions around the world
[37:15] to have the spirit of god in them
[37:18] because of that one thing
[37:20] was once in one man now it's in the many
[37:22] member body of jesus christ
[37:25] we're all a part of that body as lively
[37:28] stones living stones we've been
[37:31] quickened
[37:32] made alive stones that fit into that
[37:34] body
[37:35] that god has the preeminence god is the
[37:37] head of it god is the one that's in
[37:39] control of this body
[37:40] he has called us out of light see
[37:44] um as a nation as a
[37:47] as a a group see because that
[37:51] that nation that tells us there that
[37:54] we're a part of
[37:55] uh makes us a part of one another
[37:58] makes us a part of him we're all a part
[38:01] of each other
[38:03] god is the head of that corner amen
[38:07] we're that house that god chose to live
[38:10] in
[38:10] that household or that family
[38:14] that family is a body we're all a part
[38:16] of that same family
[38:18] amen being a part of him let's move on
[38:21] ephesians chapter five
[38:25] ephesians chapter five we'll begin uh
[38:28] reading with verse 21.
[38:33] pardon me ephesians 5 21.
[38:40] ephesians 5 21 is continuing with this
[38:42] headship
[38:43] amen this headship
[38:49] ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves one
[38:51] to another in the fear of god
[38:54] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[38:56] husbands as unto the lord
[39:00] for the husband is the head of the wife
[39:02] even as
[39:03] christ is the head of the church
[39:08] and he is the savior of the body
[39:11] again god reminding us the spiritual
[39:14] typing the natural the natural typing
[39:16] the spiritual
[39:18] god's helping us understand the feminist
[39:21] part
[39:21] being under subjection to the male part
[39:25] helping us realize that why submitting
[39:27] themselves to their own husbands
[39:29] as unto the lord amen now as as unto the
[39:32] lord
[39:33] you've got to remember that part the
[39:36] husband is the head of the wife
[39:38] even as christ is the head of the church
[39:40] and that's true
[39:42] and you say that brings well then then
[39:45] the husband is the the ruler
[39:48] well you better be careful where you go
[39:50] with that rulership buddy because
[39:52] you're responsible to god for that
[39:55] and god is the one that will hold you
[39:57] responsible
[39:59] so uh you want to make sure that
[40:02] you're going to take on that holy
[40:03] responsibility you understand what that
[40:05] responsibility holds
[40:07] because you're responsible to god for
[40:08] that and for her
[40:10] amen because it's as unto the lord
[40:14] husband is the head of the wife even as
[40:16] christ is the head of the church he is
[40:19] the head of
[40:19] his bride amen the head of that body
[40:23] the church and is the savior of the body
[40:27] therefore as the church is subject unto
[40:29] christ
[40:30] so let the wives be uh be to their own
[40:33] husbands in everything
[40:35] husbands love your wives
[40:39] even as christ also loved the church
[40:42] and gave himself for it
[40:46] there you go you got to understand if
[40:48] you have if you understand
[40:50] how jesus loves his bride
[40:53] you can understand how much him as the
[40:56] head
[40:57] loves you and gave his life for you
[41:00] and what he did for us that we can put
[41:03] ourselves in that position of
[41:05] recognizing that headship
[41:08] then we can understand the position that
[41:10] we are to fulfill as men
[41:12] as husbands because that honor
[41:15] that's supposed to be bestowed goes both
[41:18] ways
[41:19] friends it goes both ways that honor
[41:21] that's supposed to be
[41:22] uh given
[41:26] is is on both sides see the husband's
[41:29] the head of the wife he was christ said
[41:31] head of the church therefore as the
[41:33] church is subject becomes christ let the
[41:34] wise be their own husband husbands love
[41:36] your wives even as christ
[41:38] also loved the church and he gave
[41:40] himself forth
[41:41] he loved this church so much he gave
[41:43] himself for it that he might
[41:45] sanctify and cleanse it with a washing
[41:47] of
[41:48] water by the word now what's god doing
[41:51] what's jesus doing for his bride
[41:54] he not only saved her but he called her
[41:58] and separated her and put her aside
[42:02] washing her with the water sanctifying
[42:05] and cleansing her with the washing of
[42:07] the water
[42:08] see the the
[42:12] he's typing this of course the husband
[42:14] and and christ
[42:15] the church the bride as the church
[42:18] he not only gave himself for it but he
[42:21] he did that so he could be the one to
[42:24] sanctify her
[42:25] that he could be the one to cleanse her
[42:27] that he could be the one
[42:28] to purify her that he could be the one
[42:31] to
[42:32] to consecrate her sanctifies
[42:34] consecrating
[42:36] and cleanses to purify her by the
[42:38] washing of the water of the word
[42:40] if you take the water and that washing
[42:44] uh brother brahm talks about it quite
[42:46] extensively and invisible union but you
[42:48] go back into
[42:49] uh numbers uh believe it's chapter 19 in
[42:52] the waters of separation
[42:54] when you get into the waters of
[42:55] separation what did that do what that
[42:58] did
[42:58] of course you'd say well you still
[43:00] believe the old testament yeah i do
[43:03] and and all that does is bring from then
[43:06] of the literal washing that they had
[43:08] there and those
[43:08] waters of separation was to bring a
[43:11] divine remember
[43:12] you're a royal priesthood you're a holy
[43:15] nation
[43:16] we're not talking about the united
[43:17] states we're not talking about germany
[43:19] england
[43:20] uh france china we're talking about you
[43:23] the body of jesus christ we're talking
[43:25] about the bride of jesus christ you as
[43:27] that body
[43:28] that holy nation you are called by god
[43:32] that
[43:32] separates you that waters of separation
[43:36] the old testament was what god brought
[43:38] to them to cleanse them
[43:39] see to cleanse and to purify to
[43:42] consecrate them
[43:43] so that they would be a separate people
[43:47] that's why god gave of course abraham
[43:49] the seal of circumcision to the men
[43:52] that's why he give to the the the group
[43:55] the things that they needed to do the
[43:57] course all the holy days the religious
[43:59] ceremonies and
[44:00] and the priests had to have this garment
[44:02] and everything just right god gave all
[44:04] those things to them
[44:06] to separate them from all the rest of
[44:08] the world
[44:09] why did god separate them because there
[44:11] are different people
[44:13] they were called to serve him they were
[44:15] called as
[44:16] his people they weren't to look like
[44:19] serpent seed they weren't
[44:20] to look like the world they weren't to
[44:22] look like the city folk
[44:24] they were god called god ordained
[44:28] god chosen consecrated and purified they
[44:31] were
[44:31] separate god called them separate
[44:35] he changed their diet he changed their
[44:36] clothes he changed everything about them
[44:38] well for him
[44:39] when you become washed and cleansed and
[44:42] consecrated you become
[44:44] a part of him you are his chosen so
[44:47] those waters of the separation of the
[44:50] word
[44:50] it's the word that does the separation
[44:52] now amen and we're not talking about
[44:54] prejudice we're not talking about racism
[44:56] we're talking about god's people amen
[45:00] you say well god is it is do we believe
[45:03] in segregation well when it comes to the
[45:05] work we do
[45:07] but that's the only dividing line has
[45:09] nothing to do with the prejudice has
[45:11] nothing to do with racism
[45:13] because as christians as god loved
[45:15] everybody we do
[45:17] we lose there's nothing so souls were 10
[45:21] million worlds man how could we ever
[45:23] think anything
[45:24] derogatory about someone with a soul
[45:26] contained worth a million worlds
[45:28] no no because because of who we
[45:32] are and we know how precious life is
[45:35] that's why we don't agree with those
[45:37] that would get in office that would
[45:39] uh promote abortion uh i would never
[45:42] vote for someone who
[45:44] uh promoted abortion
[45:47] because it's not uh it's murder
[45:50] so but we'll move on from that but you
[45:53] understand
[45:53] that waters of separation jesus came
[45:56] himself
[45:58] made us a royal priesthood by
[46:01] sanctifying
[46:02] us as the head of the body amen
[46:05] he's the head notice the
[46:07] responsibilities we said before
[46:09] as the head sanctified
[46:12] cleansed consecrated purified this bride
[46:15] by the washing of the water by the word
[46:18] the word brings the separation amen
[46:22] the word brings to separation so you say
[46:24] the word is everything else god does
[46:26] for us in the separating of helping us
[46:29] see
[46:29] that we're different as a peculiar
[46:31] people from the rest of the world we are
[46:34] god called god chosen not everybody
[46:37] is and that may sound
[46:41] bad may sound prideful i don't know what
[46:44] you want to think about it that's what
[46:45] the bible says
[46:47] if you're a part of it then it doesn't
[46:49] matter if
[46:50] you're a part of it then there's nothing
[46:51] to it you're just a part of it see
[46:54] you you don't get mad at it you don't
[46:57] consider it a
[46:58] prejudiced or anything because you're
[47:00] part of it
[47:02] if you're a part of it then you're just
[47:03] that's just who you are see
[47:05] because you're a part of it it's just
[47:07] like
[47:08] the only people that yell and scream at
[47:10] the cops today are the ones that are
[47:11] crooks
[47:14] the good law-abiding citizens aren't
[47:15] screaming and yelling at the cops
[47:17] because they obey the law the the ones
[47:20] that are screaming and yelling and don't
[47:21] like cops around the people that are
[47:22] things
[47:23] the people that don't do things wrong
[47:25] that or don't obey the law
[47:26] those that people don't like them anyway
[47:30] we'll move on that's a whole other
[47:31] subject but the washing the water is
[47:33] what separates us
[47:35] amen who did that jesus
[47:39] by what means the word washington the
[47:42] water by the word
[47:43] that waters of separation has brought us
[47:46] and divided us apart from the rest of
[47:48] the world
[47:49] now we're not a part of the rest of the
[47:51] world we don't belong to the rest of the
[47:53] world
[47:54] jesus is our husband we are his bride
[47:58] and we owe our fidelity to him
[48:02] solely to him amen we'll get to that in
[48:04] a minute we owe our fidelity to him
[48:07] we are we are chased to the lord
[48:10] amen because we've been separated he is
[48:14] the savior of the body
[48:15] become a holy priesthood to offer
[48:17] spiritual sacrifices as a separate
[48:20] people amen and whoever and whosoever
[48:23] will let them come
[48:24] see i'm not saying my foreign no more
[48:27] it's whosoever will so whosoever
[48:30] is part of that wonderful that's great
[48:32] we're all a part of that same mystical
[48:33] body of jesus christ
[48:35] amen 27 first that he might present it
[48:39] to himself
[48:41] present it who me you the bride
[48:44] presented to who himself
[48:48] a glorious church not having spot or
[48:51] wrinkle or any such thing but that
[48:54] it should be holy and without blemish
[48:56] how in the world do we
[48:58] as humans obtain a garment that's
[49:01] without spot wrinkle or blemish
[49:04] that he would present to himself because
[49:06] it's his garment
[49:08] we were wrote in his righteousness not
[49:11] ours
[49:12] he took my place at calvary so i could
[49:15] take his here
[49:17] i jettisoned my sin corruptable
[49:21] garnet to take on his righteous garment
[49:24] now that garment was without spot
[49:26] wrinkle or blemish so
[49:27] it's not me it's him
[49:31] it's him working that work in me that he
[49:34] might present
[49:34] us this bride to himself as a glorious
[49:39] church
[49:40] not having spot wrinkle or any such
[49:42] thing
[49:43] holy without blemish praise the lord
[49:47] now we're robed in his righteousness now
[49:50] wonder you can approach the throne of
[49:51] god boldly
[49:53] because you're standing not on your own
[49:55] merits but on his
[49:57] you're not standing on your own
[49:58] righteousness but he is
[50:00] that helps us understand he took my
[50:02] place so i could take his
[50:04] well that's more than just a song friend
[50:06] that's a reality
[50:08] that's a fact that's something that
[50:10] brings us into
[50:11] perfect community fellowship with the
[50:13] lord because he took our place
[50:16] he's made us blessed is the man whom god
[50:19] will not repute sin

[50:58] look at it i'm not worried about
[51:00] you think about what the hospital says
[51:02] the doctor says i couldn't care less
[51:04] about what the doctors hospitals say
[51:05] what does god say how does god look at
[51:08] it
[51:09] when we do those things and act that way
[51:11] what is god thinking about you
[51:13] the bible says that a man that would
[51:16] that
[51:17] should love his wife as his own body
[51:20] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[51:23] for no man
[51:24] ever yet hateth his own flesh but nerds
[51:26] and cherished it
[51:27] even as the lord the church oh yeah you
[51:30] stand
[51:30] fine and clear and perfect amen

[51:36] that's not god
[51:38] amen that's the devil that's a satanic
[51:41] spirit
[51:44] for we are members of his body of his
[51:46] flesh of his bone for this cause shall
[51:48] men
[51:49] leave his father and mother and shall be
[51:51] joined unto his wife and they too
[51:54] shall be one flesh this is a great
[51:56] mystery
[51:58] but i speak concerning concerning christ
[52:00] in the church
[52:01] this is a great mystery singular
[52:05] or what's he talking about he's talking
[52:07] about christ in the church
[52:09] yes it's a type of the bride it's a type
[52:12] of the bride
[52:14] of humans of men and women
[52:19] but he's talking about bride about
[52:22] christ in his church
[52:24] see we came from one another
[52:28] we came from him the man is to
[52:31] love his wife as he loves himself
[52:34] because he loves jesus it's like i've
[52:37] said many times friend i
[52:39] you know people think that this bride is
[52:41] going to have to go through some big
[52:42] punishment or some great
[52:44] tribulation or something friend we don't
[52:46] do that god didn't marry us
[52:48] brother man who said god didn't marry
[52:49] this pride to put her through a bunch of
[52:50] punishment
[52:52] he didn't marry her carry her across the
[52:54] threshold and then beat up on her
[52:56] no no no doesn't work that way see let
[52:59] me read you this quote here
[53:01] mystery of christ is a mystery now you
[53:04] see the secret
[53:05] what to the restored fallen eve as
[53:08] she was a pre-figure eve was a
[53:11] pre-figure of the church and now
[53:13] as god opened up the sight of adam and
[53:15] took out eve by his own flesh and blood
[53:18] divided in his spirit masculine feminist
[53:20] course masculine state adam
[53:22] finished spirit he put an e to feminist
[53:25] she put in eve
[53:26] took the rib from under his side and
[53:28] made eve out of it
[53:31] so god did the same thing god did the
[53:33] same thing
[53:35] taking out of the side of christ the
[53:37] blood and the water
[53:38] and christ is the word and taking the
[53:41] word in making up
[53:42] his church amen his bride
[53:46] a word bride without spot wrinkle or
[53:49] blemish
[53:50] see eve back to himself again redeemed
[53:54] by the blood that was to come from his
[53:56] body
[53:57] out of his own body this bride came from
[54:00] his own body
[54:01] came this bride amen you see it now
[54:04] god's great mystery being unfolded
[54:06] it's been hidden since the foundation of
[54:08] the world prefigured all the way down
[54:10] through watch it now see that says
[54:12] mysteries that was his brought in
[54:14] in the revelation of jesus christ and
[54:16] here in ephesians many other places
[54:19] it'll give you to it because she is to
[54:22] be
[54:23] a word church a word bride
[54:27] now down through the ages he has been
[54:29] slowly unfolding this mystery
[54:32] revealing it now can you see down
[54:35] through what happened in pre-figure now
[54:38] he opened adam's side took out the flesh
[54:41] which is adam to make eve
[54:42] the bride has to be the word because
[54:46] he is the word she is the word
[54:50] because he is the word he's not the word
[54:53] because she's the word
[54:55] she's the word because he's the word
[54:57] because she came
[54:58] from him that's how he could cleanse her
[55:03] sanctify her unto himself and present
[55:06] him to
[55:07] himself as he brought the spot wrinkle
[55:10] or blemish because it's the word
[55:13] we the bride are the word because of the
[55:16] word
[55:17] be made flesh that makes her
[55:21] that expression of jesus christ that
[55:24] preeminence in her makes her that
[55:27] expression
[55:28] amen now i want to look i i got a couple
[55:31] more scriptures i don't know if i get
[55:32] both of my time's running out but
[55:34] i want to go to first corinthians
[55:36] chapter 6
[55:39] and verse 12. first corinthians chapter
[55:43] 6 verse 12
[55:45] and i want to start reading here
[55:49] because i want to get back to the point
[55:50] that we were just reading
[55:52] in ephesians where paul's talking about
[55:55] husband and wife
[55:56] or paul's talking about the the natural
[55:59] type and the spiritual of christ and the
[56:01] bride
[56:02] and the husband and the and and the wife
[56:05] see
[56:05] and and how we belong to him
[56:09] man we're bought with a price see we're
[56:11] not our own because we're bought with a
[56:13] price
[56:14] but first corinthians 6 12 all things
[56:18] are lawful unto me but all things are
[56:20] not expedient
[56:22] or profitable or good paul's saying i
[56:25] could do anything
[56:28] lawfully but i can't do anything that
[56:33] that's not profitable or good that might
[56:36] put a stumbling block or something in
[56:38] front of somebody
[56:39] oh i could do it and i could do it
[56:41] legally or by the word
[56:44] but i wouldn't do certain things just
[56:45] because it might stumble somebody else
[56:47] is what he's saying it's not expedient
[56:49] or good to do it see
[56:51] all things are lawful for me but i will
[56:53] not be brought
[56:54] under the power of any there you go
[56:59] then he just didn't in a nutshell just
[57:01] sew up my preeminence
[57:03] he just paul just said i will not be
[57:07] under the power of any amen
[57:11] he has the preeminence i'm not going to
[57:13] be under the power of
[57:15] a government under the power of of
[57:18] anybody i'm going to be under the power
[57:20] of jesus christ yes we give honor to our
[57:23] president we give honor to our bosses
[57:25] things like that we do those that have
[57:28] we honor those that have rule over
[57:30] that's the bible
[57:31] we know that but i will not be brought
[57:34] under the power
[57:35] of anybody but jesus christ
[57:38] has the preeminence in me the
[57:41] preeminence in you
[57:44] eats for the belly the belly for meats
[57:46] and what he's talking about now is
[57:48] i'm not i'm not even gonna be brought
[57:50] under the power of my own body
[57:53] is that okay i mean there's a real
[57:56] important part of fasting
[57:58] i i know you know the bible says praying
[58:00] fast that we like to pray fast but
[58:02] there is a part of fasting unfortunately
[58:05] hopefully people still do it
[58:09] i'm thankful the lord give it to me to
[58:11] be able to do but
[58:12] um but i hope we do it but notice he's
[58:15] saying
[58:15] and this power is actually reserved even
[58:18] to you
[58:19] and your own will he's reserving this to
[58:22] your own body's
[58:24] control or your own willpower see of
[58:27] your own self
[58:29] this if we were to go by our own cells
[58:31] where would we end up
[58:32] but he's talking i'm not going to come
[58:34] under the power of that means for the
[58:36] belly the belly for meats but god shall
[58:38] destroy both of them
[58:39] i'm not going to come under power to
[58:41] that
[58:44] but god shall destroy both uh it in them
[58:46] now the body
[58:47] is not for fornication but for the lord
[58:51] and the lord for the body fornication is
[58:54] unclean living
[58:55] amen and people think it's just a
[58:57] certain act but
[58:58] brother brown tells us fornication is
[59:00] just unclean living see
[59:01] so the body paul's saying now the body
[59:03] is not for fornication but for the lord
[59:06] and the lord is for the body see
[59:10] not to mention now that fornication is
[59:12] not just a physical fornication it's not
[59:14] just a
[59:15] natural unclean living that is spiritual
[59:18] too
[59:18] friend that is spiritual if you're
[59:21] partake if you claim to be
[59:23] jesus christ and you're partaking of
[59:25] something that's hybrid or man-made or
[59:27] you're falling along under the hospice
[59:29] of
[59:30] of some organization or denomination or
[59:33] something and you're
[59:35] you're being controlled by them and what
[59:37] they're feeding you is their dogma
[59:39] then you're under their control paul
[59:42] says i won't be brought up the power of
[59:44] any
[59:45] but we now fall
[59:49] under the headship of him the body is
[59:52] not for fornication
[59:54] it's not fun clean living neither is
[59:57] the spirit your spirit's not for
[1:00:01] fornication
[1:00:03] brother god put away his original bride
[1:00:07] for spiritual fornication
[1:00:09] we are not for fornication see we're not
[1:00:11] for unclean living
[1:00:12] we are for the lord our body our spirit
[1:00:16] our souls
[1:00:17] they are the lords they don't belong to
[1:00:19] me
[1:00:20] amen i sold them to him i gave them to
[1:00:23] him
[1:00:24] i want him to have them i am bought with
[1:00:26] a price i no longer
[1:00:28] my own is that the scripture we are no
[1:00:30] longer our own we are bought with a
[1:00:32] price
[1:00:33] i belong to him see god has both raised
[1:00:36] up the lord and will raise up
[1:00:38] us by his own power so now not only do
[1:00:41] we come
[1:00:42] out of jesus christ at calvary but he
[1:00:44] has raised us
[1:00:45] up well he's raised us up has quickened
[1:00:48] us
[1:00:49] lively stones were sitting in heavenly
[1:00:52] places in christ jesus now what is that
[1:00:54] that's the bride's place
[1:00:56] each one of your positions in that body
[1:01:00] is sitting in that heavenly place
[1:01:03] place is plural because there's many
[1:01:05] member bodies see
[1:01:07] but we're all a part of that same body
[1:01:10] he raised up the lord will also raise us
[1:01:13] up by his own power
[1:01:15] romans 8 says that same spirit dwell in
[1:01:18] you it will quicken you
[1:01:20] your mortal body make it alive raise it
[1:01:23] up
[1:01:24] friend aren't that you know what we're
[1:01:25] looking for our loved ones are

[1:01:36] going to change these bodies we're going
[1:01:38] to go into
[1:01:39] up the air meet him to a land who the
[1:01:42] marriage supper of the lamb
[1:01:43] know you not that your bodies are the
[1:01:45] members of christ
[1:01:47] shall i then take the members of christ
[1:01:50] and and
[1:01:51] make them the members of a harlot god
[1:01:54] forbid that's not just physical now
[1:01:56] that's spiritual
[1:01:58] we are to be chaste to the lord
[1:02:01] amen we are chaste to the lord not to
[1:02:04] fornicate
[1:02:06] with unclean living spiritually or
[1:02:09] naturally
[1:02:10] we are to yoke ourselves up with the
[1:02:13] pure
[1:02:14] revealed word
[1:02:18] what no you're not that he which is
[1:02:21] joined to a harlot is one body
[1:02:24] for two shall the two saith he
[1:02:27] shall be one flesh so that's flesh what
[1:02:29] about spirit
[1:02:32] one if we're joined to christ
[1:02:35] we're one in him we're one
[1:02:39] oh i just i love that philippians 2.
[1:02:42] we've read it through this
[1:02:43] series maybe next time maybe next week
[1:02:45] we'll read it again
[1:02:46] we yoked with him or one
[1:02:51] let me move on but he uh but he that is
[1:02:54] joined unto the lord is one spirit flee
[1:02:56] fornication
[1:02:57] every sin that a man doeth is without
[1:02:59] the body but he that committed
[1:03:01] fornication
[1:03:02] sinneth against his own body what
[1:03:05] know ye not that your body is the temple
[1:03:07] of the holy ghost which is in you
[1:03:10] which ye have of god and ye are not your
[1:03:12] own
[1:03:13] for ye are bought with a price
[1:03:16] therefore glorify god in your body your
[1:03:18] spirit which are god's
[1:03:20] we belong to him we are bought with a
[1:03:22] price we are not our own
[1:03:25] amen paul obviously they were debating
[1:03:28] with him there
[1:03:29] and he said what he steals them he says
[1:03:32] what
[1:03:33] know ye not that your body is the temple
[1:03:35] of the holy ghost
[1:03:37] amen your body is the temple of the holy
[1:03:40] ghost this is where the presence
[1:03:42] of the spirit of god jesus christ dwells
[1:03:45] no you're not your body is the temple of
[1:03:48] the holy ghost
[1:03:48] which is in you the holy ghost
[1:03:52] which he have of god we are not our own
[1:03:55] we're bought with a price if we're
[1:03:58] bought with a price we don't want to be
[1:04:00] yoked up with someone else
[1:04:02] or something else or fornicate or flirt
[1:04:05] with the world or
[1:04:06] flirt with some denomination or
[1:04:08] something or something
[1:04:09] darkness oh god no
[1:04:13] lord help us we this bride is chaste to
[1:04:17] him
[1:04:18] we are we are yoked with him we are
[1:04:21] one in him we came from him the word
[1:04:24] we are the word and married back and
[1:04:26] joined back with him
[1:04:27] as one flesh as one body as one
[1:04:31] member of that body praise the lord he
[1:04:34] is the head of that body
[1:04:36] he is the preeminence over that body
[1:04:39] he has a preeminence in me why because
[1:04:42] i'm bought
[1:04:44] you know i can go to a store
[1:04:49] and i could want an apple
[1:04:53] as long as that apple is in that store
[1:04:54] and belongs to the store owner
[1:04:57] that store owner can do whatever he
[1:04:58] wants to that apple belongs to him
[1:05:01] i can go to the store and i can look at
[1:05:03] the apple and i can pick it up
[1:05:05] if he lets me i can pick it up of course
[1:05:07] with kovac now you might not even be
[1:05:09] allowed to do that but i don't know
[1:05:10] anyway if
[1:05:11] you pick up an apple if he allows you to
[1:05:13] because it's not your apple
[1:05:15] but once you take that apple and you pay
[1:05:17] for it it becomes yours
[1:05:20] when it becomes yours you can do
[1:05:21] whatever you want to with it because
[1:05:22] it's yours belongs to you now
[1:05:24] doesn't belong to anybody else doesn't
[1:05:27] belong to the store anymore
[1:05:29] you don't belong to satan anymore you
[1:05:32] belong to jesus christ
[1:05:33] you don't belong to yourself you belong
[1:05:36] to christ
[1:05:37] and if we belong to christ then we do
[1:05:40] what he calls for us to do
[1:05:42] because it has the preeminence in our
[1:05:44] lives because we're bought with that
[1:05:46] price
[1:05:48] god has paid for us god shed his
[1:05:50] precious blood
[1:05:51] gave his precious life that we would be
[1:05:55] bought with that price that we would
[1:05:56] belong to him
[1:05:57] now he does what he desires with us
[1:06:01] and we say yes lord yes lord
[1:06:04] now if apple had legs mouth they could
[1:06:06] run and talk and whatever
[1:06:08] had a spirit a heart soul
[1:06:11] then they could have their own free will
[1:06:13] and you have your own free will
[1:06:16] but what i i've died to myself though to
[1:06:19] raise in jesus christ
[1:06:21] that he might have the preeminence a
[1:06:23] bride like that
[1:06:24] is the only bride the only group that
[1:06:27] could be the full expression of jesus
[1:06:29] christ for this last day
[1:06:31] and that's what he wants us to be we
[1:06:33] belong to him
[1:06:35] holy fully totally
[1:06:38] we belong to him amen
[1:06:44] we are his purchased possession
[1:06:47] and there's one more scripture i want to
[1:06:49] read real quick we want to expound on it
[1:06:51] very much but just to follow up with
[1:06:53] what we just read
[1:06:54] if he just read to you um
[1:06:58] that we are bought with the price of
[1:07:00] ephesians now ephesians chapter 1
[1:07:03] verse 13 and 14. look at this real quick
[1:07:06] we close
[1:07:08] ephesians 1 13 in whom ye also
[1:07:11] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[1:07:14] truth the gospel of your salvation
[1:07:17] in whom also after that ye believed ye
[1:07:20] were
[1:07:20] sealed with the holy spirit of promise
[1:07:22] after that you believed
[1:07:24] other denominations a lot of christians
[1:07:26] and well a lot of millions believe this
[1:07:29] but those that do think maybe to get it
[1:07:31] in simultaneously instantaneously and
[1:07:34] you can
[1:07:35] but the bible says here after that ye
[1:07:37] believed
[1:07:38] you were sealed with the holy spirit of
[1:07:40] promise
[1:07:42] which is the earnest the down payment
[1:07:45] of our inheritance unto until the
[1:07:48] redemption
[1:07:48] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:07:50] praise of his glory what is that
[1:07:52] purchased possession
[1:07:53] we belong to him we are bought with a
[1:07:55] price
[1:07:57] we are bought with a price where his
[1:07:58] purchased possession now we belong to
[1:08:00] him
[1:08:02] now we have received that earnest or
[1:08:04] that down payment of our
[1:08:05] eternal inheritance until the
[1:08:08] full redemption not just that we've been
[1:08:11] redeemed spiritually
