TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone god bless you today welcome to our home streaming service sorry we've had to revert back to this for now but explain a little bit of it to you but it's been a little connection kind of close with the kovat thing going on so I felt let I actually kind of felt a little warning during the week accident with things going on but then when things become a little closer to us got a little more serious brother Zack it had some symptoms and things and went tests it don't believe he has it by the grace of God but you know we just want to be very careful and one of the prayer requests we had also as her sister saw Shay she's in the hospital now and she looks like me maybe testing positive for Co but she has a lot of the symptoms and sister Celia had been around her and things so we're just just by the grace of God and just feel warned if the Lord to go back to streaming for right now or at least for today we'll see about next week what happens next week but just the extenuating circumstances and the way I'd really had been filming on my heart all week about it we just felt led to try to stay a home for today see what the Lord takes this you know Saints none of us are exempt from this we're still humans were still human bodies were still human people in this world although I believe and know that God has us hedged about I also believe a part of that hedge is God's warning and I believe if God's warning us or God's showing us something is sort of like a prophecy is the way I look at it if you will because you know when brother Branham talked about prophecy he said you know prophecy would come forth to the church and say brother so-and-so don't go on your job tomorrow because the trucks and over you're going to get hurt or killed something like that so that brother would know not to do that not to go to that place so this is kind of that in my opinion the way I look at it there's the Lord's protection I believe the Lord is just saying that you know this is happening that's happening and I believe a part of what the Lord does for us is to warn us and let us know don't go here don't do this and part of that warning is just saying that you know it's helping us stay in the place that we need to be with him now without that warning as we've had the past few weeks we just have regular service and in-person service and enjoyed it very much the Holiday Inn as I've told you Joe very much more speaking to your faces rather than this little camera on the top of my computer screen there but I know you're there at least some of you are there anyway and if you're not there now hopefully you will be there during the week or something you can listen and pick this up again at your convenience but again just fell that because of that because some of the extenuating circumstances and I believe again the warning of the Lord that we just we just stop this because yesterday when a lot of this stuff started evolving my heart and my mind went back to what I felt I kind of felt pulled of the Lord during the week but I wanted to make sure it wasn't just me I wanted to make sure there wasn't just something in me that was saying saying one thing or another but then when the Lord vindicates it then it becomes more real so I believe that is real and that the Lord is still protecting us and watching over us but it is still very real so let's just remember those that have contracted the kovat for several people in Arizona you North Carolina I guess the two states connections I have the most with their in North Carolina and Arizona and around here and brother Ron Peterson and different ones in his church and I know back east for the Hat of night and some of the Tim Hayden several other brothers that I know very personally have contracted it everybody's doing well nobody's I mean they've had difficulties I think whether Ron Peterson had double pneumonia like sister Sergei's in the hospital he says she has two blood clots in her lungs I believe it was double pneumonia but irregardless of the actual circumstances we know that she really needs our prayers and you just continue to remember her in prayer I believe others surrounded town I've heard have contracted it so I'm very thankful that the Lord protection is upon us and even though that may happen that God is still the healer even if you get the flu God still the healer to get cancer God still the healer if you get a tumor or something whatever it is God still the healer so regardless of what this is and what goes on with it I believe God warns us and helps to keep us away from it and protected and provided for and blessed so let's just continue to remember each one if you know them personally if you don't you just pray generally I guess if you don't know anybody else that that has contracted the Lord would just bless them and and touch them and keep them protected state or healing so whichever the situation may be so and please remember brother Zach again he's doing well he just went got tested yesterday I don't believe it is Kovac I think the Lord's protected him from that but anyway just remember them in prayer if you would the golf a touch can help them also got a request from the sister she Leah about her brother Harlan we want to continue to remember him in prayers we've been praying for him continuously now for two or three months or so so remember to pray for him 'yes we mentioned last sunday he had his big case coming up for his big court hearing coming up this past Friday well of course of quote according to the cause of the coma that that got postponed so just remember him in prayer he's still kind of in limbo right now but just trusting somehow this is going to work to come in his favor and that the judge is going to find favor with him but please remember him in prayer also got a request from brother Pat today for his and sister Pat son leave that you would remember him in prayer for a job and the Lord would just leave him and help him get himself back right and on his feet also got every question brother Danny for his boys he asked her brother Danny that they would find the Lord and that God would move on their hearts and that they would accept him into their lives as their Savior and be filled with the Holy Spirit in and move forward with the Lord so I believe that's a great admirable request coming from a Father's heart today so let's remember brother Danny's request I didn't get any others but we obviously want to continue remember brother Dennis wife Leah and prayer Xiu Yin is still a nurse on the front lines and staying protected staying safe and staying well so we're thankful for that and each one of us in the name of the Lord God's been good to us God's blessed us brother Rogers been very busy we're very busy this week and but what we do is mostly secluded it's usually just the two of us but very thankful God's been blessing it's been awful hot but the Lord's been blessing us and I'm so thankful for that but just to remember us in prayer the work we do it's pretty physical and out and they eat a lot of times what God's really been blessing and he sees and making the day's work with the jobs to work were not too much in direct Sun and things like that and that's just really a blessing here America the fire the firefighters and those that are doing what they can to help put that fire out keep it under control and save lives and structures and just just remember the broad worldwide we're all very needy today we know that we're in the last days we don't know how much time we got left but we certainly do know and can see how all this is shaping up to bring it to the point of in pre-tribulation tribulation the time that's coming together now the mark of the beast which survive will be gone for that brace the Lord but see all that shaping up so it's swarming itself we know the image the beast world council church is there but God is mindful of us and he's always with us so I'm very thankful that God blesses us blesses us as a congregation and keeps us healthy strong and provided for us we'll remember these requests and got one the message for you today based off of last week's message a continuation and add on to if you will of last week but let's just bow our hearts to the Lord in prayer and remember these requests as we go to the Lord precious Jesus father were so very thankful God that you're with us and that you never leave us or forsake us we know God that your hand is upon us to lead us and guide us according to your perfect will and to be led by your spirit God is such a privilege Lord to know that you're with us and that you're always there the God you unction us and you strengthen us and sometimes Lord you watching us in ways that we may not understand or Lord we could maybe not follow through with like we should God sometimes we get in trouble with ourselves because we don't maybe follow the instruction you give us or recognize how strong it is God but lord I believe that you've called for this time and for us to come together in our homes again today and have this little streaming service so I pray that you would bless it Lord I pray God that you would speak through these lips and help us Lord to get ahold of the word that you have for us today to draw us closer to you Lord to have a greater love for you and to have a greater love for our fellow man and for our brothers and sisters and for our church Lord we're so thankful God that you are mindful of us and that you lead us and help us and show us Lord what your mind is in our lives Lord I pray that you would speak through these lips father today whatever you'd have to be hurt and God trusting you the to speak Lord and not just anoint the speaker but the hearers as well whoever may hear this message Lord live or recorded or and whatever way they may get at God may you bless with it I pray you move upon every prayer request Lord that I mentioned and it's upon the hearts of your people out there today God may you just touch them and strengthen and be with each one God we know there's many Lord are several now that have contracted this nasty disease but believing Lord that your perfect healing is with us government you're keeping this safe that your blessing and that your healing and that your grace is upon us Lord regardless of what's going on today I know God that you would sister Celia and brother Zak God for your protection and for your healing and for your grace in their lives and for each one of us it's a congregation and as a people god I pray you help on her brother pass request sister Pat Lord for their son Lee God may your hand be upon him and Lord sister she Leah's brother Harlan and Lord the requests of brother Danny gave for his sons believing God that that admirable request on his heart Lord that his sons would find you and that they would be born again and filled with your spirit and put you first in their lives Lord and God it's a wonderful thing that we can do to come before you and and each one of these requests Lord has been made known and Lord sister Sarge Shea we certainly want to lift her up before you in prayer to God Lord sitting in the hospital bed now and not being able to get visitors and things must be a very difficult situation brother Paul their Lord not being able to go see his wife but Lord trusting that God you have everything under control and it's all in your hands and Lord that you would use these things God that it would be for your glory and honor that you would leading guide us and where we should be and what your perfect will is for each one of our lives god I thank you for this ability to be able to stream and to be able to have this time to come together live Lord with those of my precious congregation and those of like precious faith bless us today god we commit ourselves to you and ask your blessings upon us and upon the remaining part of this service as we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you today even if you would turn with me in your Bible to Romans chapter 2 pardon me for a moment then awful drive around Tucson lately ants yes my throat the colorful drive at Romans chapter 2 we're going to begin the scripture reading and we'll just begin with the first verse and read down through the eleventh verse inclusive and just again like a sense and sort of kind of continue the thought we had last week I want to add on to it I sort of left off with you last week because we spoke on respect last week and left off Lord with a left off last week with the understanding that that respect that we have for the Lord leads to an obedience or respect in general leads to an obedience we have respect of an authority figure that it leads to an obedience and and that we have for the Lord and that's the utmost that we look to of course is the respect that we have the Lord Jesus and the obedience that follows that so I want to continue with that and then kind of move into that part of it as well but let's read this romans chapter to begin with verse one here therefore thou art inexcusable old man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemn us thy self for thou that judges do us the same thing now that's quite a that's quite a striking scripture because basically what he's telling us is that we're all human Paul's telling the Roman Church here and I believe us of course today that we are all human and you may be judging somebody for a shortcoming or a mistake in their lives but understand as you judge that person for their mistake your mistakes are going to be judged as well because we're all human we all fall make mistakes do things we shouldn't but those things that we condemn now that were judges there is condemned it's not to look upon and say okay we shouldn't be doing this or acting this way that's that's certainly common and we understand it's Christian and then we believe and I believe the Holy Spirit condemns convicts us not condemns but convicts us but this judgment is condemnation the condemnation will be brought on a person to try to make that person feel less than what they really are in Christ or no brother being used to say unchristian eyes them you don't judge a person or condemn a person to the point that it unchristian Isis I've seen so many times ministers even well unchristian eyes people are unchristian eyes their congregation to the point that they it's hard for them to even understand or believe they're even Christians that's the unchristian izing part well that's what he's saying here look we're humans we make mistakes we forgive and we move on we get closer to the Lord and we go we become greater in the eyes of the Lord not that we're perfect or infallible because we're never going to be until this body change never going to be infallible but we also know that we get so close to the Lord that we don't make that mistake anymore or we don't do that thing anymore or we don't go that place anymore we don't talk like that anymore see it's that that God helps us to understand and move past that but that mistake that's been made now this leads to that respect see that mistake that's made we can't look upon that and and condemn that person or make that person think or feel or look even in your eyes it shouldn't even be in your eyes that that person is any less in the eyes of God because that's where it matters the most doesn't matter necessarily in minds but matter in God's eyes so Paul's telling us look we're all humans we all make mistakes we all do things we shouldn't from time to time get caught in traps things I'm gonna read you maybe a quote if we get to that or a little bit later but he's telling us that now kids should not condemn us thy self that thou condemned us thyself I say to judge another condemn another that thou judge yourself or condemned yourself for thou the judges do it the same thing now you might not have been the exact same thing or making the exact same mistake that they made but your mistake is going to still be a mistake and which sin is greater and which sin is lesser unbelief is unbelief so the point she said well his sin was greater than mine well if you made that mistake it was through unbelief you they made that mistake it was through a belief so in God's eyes is there one greater than another well I say no and that's because of the respect God created his creation and he respects it we respect his creation because we respect one another we respect Bakke life respond to respond respect analyze remember last week I talked about brother Brown said you just go kill an animal just to kill it just to let it lay that's murder but if we do it you know because we need food or clothes or things like that that's different story but otherwise it's murder that's that respect see that's there that we have for each other but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things now you're looking at someone who is sinless someone who can look upon our mistakes and judge them based upon his word because he is the ultimate and think it's now this old man that judges them do such things and death the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of God or despise it thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance just as it leached you to a place of repentance that same grace of God leads them to repentance he meant so again we're all in this together we're all in the same boat see but after thy hardness and impendent heart treasures up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the the Jew first and also of the Gentile but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the to the Jew first and also to the Gentile for there is no respect of persons with God now this is a different type of respect this respect he's talking about isn't a respect of reverence or as we talked about esteem of honor and of someone's feelings it's a different type of respect when the Bible says here that God is no respecter of person that means he doesn't hold anyone higher or in a greater esteem than another if we are all the creation of God then God creates treats his creation this now baki life is Botany life in it is all what it is and the animal life is animal life and eating is all what it is in the human life is human life and it is all what it is where everyone bought with a price if we accept it and that every one of us have a soul in here we're ten million worlds so if that's the case then god doesn't respect one person over the other remember what brother Graham said if God does one thing one way or if he does one thing with one person one way he's got to do it with every person the exact same way every time or he's not God Santa or Saint doesn't matter he's got to treat everyone the exact same way every time if his salvation wasn't for everybody that he's not a just God now not everybody's going to receive it those who do receive it will receive it unto themselves become that but not everybody is going to but he did it for all you go back to the scripture many places it talks about how Jesus did this for all so God doesn't respect or have favor of one person over the other he doesn't have a bias he doesn't show respect a person a lot of times that's the misunderstanding people have especially when they talk about the Dark Ages or we talked about this maybe a month or two ago about about God and the sovereignty of God God does things the way he wants to but he doesn't do things based on bias he doesn't hear one person of cancer and not heal another based on bias he doesn't give one person one thing and not give it to the other person based on bias he doesn't look at one person better greater than the other but what he does do is that when those things appear those things come up then that that receiving of that is what that person will receive in what God is them God's just looking for someone other just taken by his word God's just looking for somebody that will believe in him faith and take him at his word and follow through with it whatever it is whoever it is this I have said many times healing is not for just for the believer or just for the Christian I should say you got to believe it but it's not just for the christian hali I've known atheists to get healed that there's plenty of people in the world today that don't even believe in God or have some other false God and they get healed from sicknesses or diseases or whatever whether they take medicine or some kind of cure some whatever inoculation whatever it is they still have to have faith to believe God's just looking for someone to take him at his word he's that he doesn't do it based on bias these things don't come just because God loves you more than me or respects me more than you he does it based on his foreknowledge and and and those who have faith to believe God knows and understands these things and I believe that's what a lot of what Paul is trying to tell us here God doesn't do it for one person not for another God hasn't forgive you of your sin and not forgive the person you're condemning for their sin no it's not that we're kind of that God's not esteeming that in that one in that way one above another he's not having more respect for one of the other but that respect that he has he has for all of us and and that respect again like we said that we have for one another that's the same one God honors faith God respects faith if you can have faith you can be healed God honors faith that's that's the point that God tries to make is that we are his workmanship I mean humanity and if we can just have faith in Him or if we can just have faith God God can bring about that healing that we're looking for look what brother Graham said here in Queen of Sheba 1958 they saw my Billy Graham's meeting sitting in the White House step singing leaning on the everlasting arms he said but because he believed look at this now because he believed he's no respecter of persons God is no respecter of persons he doesn't esteem one over the other just as real tonight as he was then only thing he's seeking listen us what I want to get only thing he's seeking for is to find someone who will have faith in him amen that's what God is looking for God simply looking for someone they don't have faith in him if we can just have faith in him then God will do what he said he would do because that's what it's based on not based on what he has bias of one person over the other but it's that respect that he has see and the respect that we have for him in that faith you know a lack of faith a lack of respect brings a lack of obedience we talked about that at the end of last week's service a lack of respect will bring a lack of obedience the Lord brought me a thought in here this morning and kind of brought this into a reality of of something that becomes real to me and things you see in the world today such as parents and their children if children don't respect their parents they're not going to obey them now of course there's the street there's this children born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies things we know that but as that child grows older if that child in that that parent has worked their life around that child to where that child has respect for that parent those parents then that child is going to be more obedient to those parents and those if that child has been raised to not have respect see it's not fear you can't raise children by fear God doesn't raise his children by fear you can't raise your children by fear if you raise your children so that they fear you then you're not going to get their obedience you might get their obedience out of fear because they're afraid afraid of you but when they get older or they grow up it that divulge is into a horrible relationship but but if you but if you can have a way the word that child respects those parents or that parent and then then that respect they're gonna obey based on the fact that the respect that you've garnered from them that you've that you've that you've showed to them and that you respect them and that respect comes then then what that obedience rises to is something that's everlasting their relationship and the respect that that'll that'll be for their rest of their lives because it's respect to obedience not fear to obedience God doesn't want us as we said last week of course the fear that we have of making a mistake or doing something wrong or the reverence that we have but God doesn't rule his children by a fear to say God's gonna send me to hell if I make a mistake that's not the kind of guy he is he doesn't work that way that's why we love him and respect him so because we've come to understand what he does and how much he means to us in that respect and so the obedience is just there we obey Him because we want to not because we're scared of him we obey Him because we love it not because we're scared of him amen so that obedience divulges are devolves into that respect into that obedience so that we have obedience and and that we trust the Lord because he's always there for us respects 1961 October 1961 though they pat you on the back and call you brother yet you know they don't believe it see they don't believe it and you can have no one know one thing you can do for them they'll call for you to come pray but it doesn't do them any good because you see they disrespect it they disrespect it they don't have faith in it they don't have faith to believe this he he says you could call that they can call you to come and pray because they've seen the results you've seen the gift of God they seemed the the miracles and the working of God and in others but they don't respect it themselves that you have to respect it yourself before you can receive it and see and even though he would go he said I would go pray it doesn't do them any good cuz they disrespected you've got to believe it see you see how now he eat couples the two together you see how he couples the respect and faith together he said they disrespected that he said you've got to believe it what does that belief that means you have to have faith that faith is showing a respect bit of the one who give it and that's God and God giveth the gifts God give us the understanding that when someone like that and brings that reverence or that respect like the gift that was in brother branham's life that people revered it people respected it now some people go too far calling something and try to make him something he's not in just a man but it's the gift a man was that gift that we respect because the gift is from God not brother branham but from God and we love the man of course but it was that gift that he's talking about the people disrespected they disrespected who knows why but they just don't believe it see you have to watch he said now those who believe and if you believe it you can see what happens you see what happens it brings obedience influence in Chicago 1963 October excuse me August 1963 I wonder my brother I wonder my sister if we'll take a look at that when holy angels listening to a mother respected you know respect obedience when holy angels has to cover their face to stand in the presence of God in reverence and in respect amen god help us those you know those chairmen say they're two wings flying two wings over their face two wings over their feet in respect crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty as we would say there's no time over there but as we would say 24/7 365 366 in leap year there there's crying holy holy Lord God Almighty he's talking about those angels covering their face in the presence of God in reverence and respect but today we find people who call themselves Christians and has no respect at all for God you know why says that because people even call themselves Christians act contrary to God's Word you had contrary to God's Word that shows you don't respect it and if you don't respect this word you don't respect God and that he says these that people who even call themselves Christians they have no respect at all for God or his word or his people or his ministry or nothing they have no respect if you don't have respect for me I don't have respect for you we don't have respect for his word we don't have respect for God we don't respect God we don't respect the man of God wouldn't respect the gift of God then what are gonna be the results there's no obedience there you don't respect God's Word why are you gonna obey it people don't obey it because they don't believe it they don't respect it there's no faith there and if you find even that even that people call themselves Christian call themselves Christian leaving the the Bible daily they don't follow the Bible anymore some of them not all of them not probably not even the majority but there are a facet of people today college those Christians don't even call by the Bible they might go by their own words or their own song or interpretation of what they think it might say or mean they might chalk the Old Testament out or they might take this little part and chop it out and you know you you you Bible starts looking like Swiss cheese because you've taken out so much of it well friend if we don't look into this as God's Holy Word and respected as such there's no gonna be any obedience there there's no reverence there there's nothing to then and if there's no reverence their eyes they're going to be any better but thankfully we still serve a living God that still has respect for humans human life and and and us as a whole but there's people that don't respect God don't respect his word don't respect his people don't respect his ministry or nothing where they are going to come up at in the resurrection when the Bible says the if the righteous scarcely be saved where were the center and the ungodly appears that's a sad thing to think about but that's exactly where a lot of people are today that the rights of Bible says if the righteous fiercely be safe were to the center and the ungodly appear if the child does not have respect for the parent where's that child going to end up maybe sometimes maybe that they'll find favor that that that young personal growth to be successful good but no almost the cases that's not that's not the case it doesn't happen that way a lot of times that person will become someone that if they had disrespect for their parent is going to have respect for the law and you see a lot of that today in this country people who have an intense disrespect for the law they talk about reforming the police I think what they need to reform is people's attitudes if people would quit resisting then a lot of this would change not all of it not saying that they're all good but not everybody not not all of any group is good but not all of any group is fact see I think the majority of most argue I think the majority of most police are good I think majority of most people of color is good most people's good that's just that's just the way I feel about now you get some of the ones that aren't and then of course it sounds like they've become the sounding board for the entire race and it's not that way but you have to have respect see if if there's no respect there there's no obedience well if there's not a home there's not with the parents and they have been able to do it then what's gonna happen in school notice no respect for the teachers and then they get in trouble at school and then they get in trouble or they end up on the street or disrespect for authority figures police or whatnot and then what kind of an individual is being raised now it's sad but that's where it begins and and that's where it leads to but unfortunately we see a lot of that in the world today let's look over in James we read this last week on it I want to just go through this real quick again James chapter 2 verse 1 and I want to read through this scripture once again as we did last week the James chapter 2 verse 1 says my brother have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory with respect of persons amen remember we talked about that last week we as God are not to look and esteem any person above the other esteem any person better than another we should always look at that person whether whether they be friend or foe as as a soul that's worth 10 million worlds and if we don't in our heart have respect for that person you cannot help that person and again like I said last week you're not even going to want to help that person if you don't respect them like you're supposed to you're going to respect that person to the place that they're a human being with a soul worth 10 million worlds what happens what what is there an accounting of God if you are able to lay hands on or talk to or witness to someone a foe or whoever to take that soul worth 10 million worlds and pull it out of the pits of Hell and put it in glory now that's not our ability but God uses us to do those things God helps us to be able to speak to those and help those people so that they come from a place that they're that shouldn't be up to a place where where they could spend eternity with us with the Lord my there's there's no greater thing that you can imagine or think about there's not there's no amount of money there's no possessions you could obtain people but build hospitals they spend billions of dollars on hospitals and on educational programs on reforming people and changing all of just trying to change Satan's eating the mold and be fitted around us there's no changing that but what we can do I mean billions of dollars but there's no amount of money you can apply to one soul that you've been able to lead out of the pits of hell into the kingdom of God no amount of money nor mount of possessions I don't care how much Warren Buffett Bill Gates or Bezos puts towards all these other programs and things they're just trying to reform something that's gonna burn over and rot one day I'm thinking about the soul that's eternal that that that that would be before the Lord amen that's what matters the most not one over the other but that but that respect that we have of each one for if there come unto you unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and goodly a pair on there come any also a poor man environment and you have respecting him that we're at the gate clothing and sand to him sit down here in a good place say that the poor stand out there or sit here under my foot store you not then partial in yourselves and our become judges of evil thoughts hearken my beloved brethren have not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he had promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor do not the rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats and those with people to get the greatest accolades it's sad to think because a person can dribble a basketball better than another person and make millions of dollars because they can do it that we should listen to them over someone else that makes them more important because someone can remember some lines and and and act like they're a person that they're not and people film them and like to watch it and that's all fine and good whatever entertainment but why does that make them a spokesperson that makes them someone that we as a society should listen to with moralities and ethics it's just sad that has come to that place and there would be the first ones to look down upon you for living the way you think by your own dictates in the Word of God it's sad do not leave blaspheme that worthy name about which ye are called if you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well but if you have respect a person you commit sin and are convinced that the law are convinced of the law of transgressors for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill there are becoming transgressor of the law but God has made us of no respecter of person to obey the law to obey the word to stand upon the word and live it the way he calls us to live look at this read a couple of things here as we move on now patriarch Abraham 1964 now Abraham was just an ordinary man it wasn't something special I never called him as far as we can have any record till he was 75 years old his wife half-sister being 65 years old at the time that probably lived together since they were very young she Sarah barring having no children God called a complete separation to separate himself from the rest of the world and from all the people and from all his kindred there was a special thing for him to do and when God expects you to do a special thing he demands a complete separation from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he as God commands it God demands it you can't do it any other way it's got to be done according to God's Way I see that's a lot of times the things that we have especially when we like hold someone in higher esteem than another person there's someone we put up on a pedestal or someone that we think of more than we do another but you know God calls your local minister your local pastor to pray for you lay hands on you whatever just as much as brother Brandon was but a lot of times I've heard people even in the message tell me nothing lately but years ago oh if only brother Branham are here well that's all well it good but the god of brother bounds here if brother baton was here God wasn't he could don't do no more the need and the rest of us can do but when God's here that's what changes the scene God give authority to the local minister the minister called by God or anyone if you will to pray for you as much as brother Branham was it's your faith it's your faith to believe it look he said you come to full of babies to obey what he says see God demands that it can't come with devout with any doubt it's got to be with faith and understanding God's Word and believing God's Worth and Holdings God's Word is reverence trust because it's God doing it we have as much right to vote to pray for one another as brother random or anybody now I know there's separate gifts there's gifts of healings and there's different gifts of helps and and prophesy things I know there's gifts and gifts of healings and thing but that shouldn't change our faith that that should have an effect on our faith our faith should be there regardless say brother sister pray for me appreciate our sisters in our church have their prayer chain that they have and they text one another all the time and how much even more important it is when they're not able to get together like you used to and have your lunch every month or something like that you're not able to do that really now although I encourage if you could but not able to do that to have that connection and that's just such a wonderful thing because you believe one another you respect one another you have that faith then if that sister those sisters pray for you they tell the brothers and that we pray and we all pray together it's gonna bring results and it has it has brought results how many times could we say we don't list them we don't write it now but how many times could we come together and remember just in the four years we've been assembled as a congregation that we remember the miracles the workings of God the things that God has done just for our little group just because of faith just because of believe me just because you love one another respect one another and revere whole one another up enough to know that if they pray for you you're going to be healed God's gonna move on the scene God's gonna touch the situation that's not all the same because that's what that that's who God is no respecter of person stuff based on bias but it's foreknowledge but we know that it moves the hand of God because you have respect for one another you have respect for God is work you obey his work we stand in obedience of his work just like Jesus you know Hebrews says that though he were a son yet he learned obedience through the things which he suffered why can you imagine just through the things he suffered learned obedience well that learned obedience was taught to us because it's the life of Jesus you don't see Jesus in every scripture you need to go back and read it because he's in here every scripture every line there's Christ because Christ is the word and then that word is where he dwells because it is him not this actual book although there's respect for this book for numerous cases places burned down in the Bible not burner or flood and the Bible be fine things like that like even a brand tavern act when the flood came and the Bible's Tamblyn up the Bible on it just like that came went right straight up okay right back now it's perfect the way it was just so they're there it is God respects that but it's not necessarily just in this book but it's in your heart that word is here by respect but he yet learned obedience to the things which he suffered I mean you think about you go back to Romans Romans says that because of one man's disobedience we fell into this Satan's Eden that's where we live today because of one man's disobedience now we know why he did it but regardless he transgressed the word and because he transgressed the word all humanity fell into the place we're at today just like living as we are in Satan's Eden by one man's disobedience but by one man's obedience Christ came and changed all of it now we've yet to receive the full benefits of that we're still living in Satan's Eden but we and ourselves have received it because we can witness to it because it's become a part of us we love it it's a part of our life we reverence it we obey it because it's a part of who we are we live it because we want to live it we obey it because we love Him because of the respect that we have for him that doesn't change but the thing that does change is our humanity and our ability to love someone or to respect someone or revere someone over the other or not that's that that's the respect or not respecter of persons that we have thirsty for life I'm going to read these couple more quotes we'll close your just a little bit amen but trust the Lord bless you today thirsty for life Dallas Texas 1958 he said what we need tonight is not an arguing look this is so prevalent god help us god help us as humans but what we need tonight is not an arguing on a little pre but what we need tonight is the Holy Ghost and fire old-fashioned powers of God to burn sin and selflessness disrespect for each other burn it out of us with the love of God amen the love of God burns out the disrespect for each other that that burn out that old selfishness and that old self-centeredness the disrespect that we have for each other running out with the love of God the power of the Holy Ghost old-fashioned power of God moving into our hearts into our lives God burn out any disrespect that I have for someone else burn out any nature in here that is unlike you Lord and let it just be the pure love of God flowing that I had the same respect now that respect comes responsibility that obedience comes with the responsibility amen comes with the responsibility of being led of his Spirit you don't just do it because you feel you know it's just it's just you're doing something but you do it because it's in your heart to do that God's leading me to do it amen praise the Lord God help burn that out of us burn that'll nature out God's gifts always find its place even if we can disagree excuse me this is in Jeffersonville 1963 even if we can disagree with a person if we can't yet do it in a brotherly way disagree amen remember above and so we're not just we're not here to just fuss and argue about some creed or some doctrine or something we're here to love one another to let the power of God come and burn out that disagreement burn out that old disrespect for one another we can even disagree with the person if we can't yet do it in a brotherly way see if Christ is in the heart then no matter how much you disagree with a man you still got love for him and respect amen love and respect I disagree with many men many times but still I've never seen one yeah I disagree with that I ever thought of anymore then put my arm around him and call him my brother try to help him the best I could and people he would say they either buy that gift they'd hug him if they had a knife that stabbed him in the back but yet his attitude was if there's something I could do for that brother any way that I can help that brother be there for them I would do it see it's not to have respect of one person over the other because he knew these people they would disagree of course we got disagreements with humans I disagree with myself sometimes I've told you that many times I'll do something to look at and say what in the world Newton why in the world you do that that didn't make any sense no but that was stupid or probably not a right word to say but that you know that's just how I feel sometimes I think that just wasn't a smart thing to do I disagree with myself sometimes no doubt we're all human you do too so if we disagree with one another you gonna think less yourself you don't think less yourself you shouldn't think less of one another is that I disagree with my disagree more I thought maybe less of that person see that's when you know you've got the love of God when you can disagree bitterly disagree and have the same feeling look not this is a different quote but have the same feeling toward that person as Christ would see then you've got something you can bitterly disagree bitterly dummy for one side to the other as hard as you can bitterly disagree but had the same feeling when it's all done had the same feeling toward that person as Christ would and how did Christ feel well he died and gave his life for that person so how about us how do we feel then that weight towards one another we still got love and respect for him I disagree with him because that I think maybe that upon disagreeing what he believes that I might not believe just like him and so forth but now I might try to project my way to him as he projects his way to me and get them closer and comb them out and see what we got but disagreement like that just as far as it comes to we should never get angry or want to hurt or destroy anyone or anything we should always be trying to build up build that person up help that person encourage that person be there as it was said for that person Amen just two more here I'll close token this is the one in Jeffersonville 1963 he says you should love one another believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly and now the people that's listening on this streaming that's not what he said so what I'm saying you may man you men you listen a minute you ever believe me you believe it now it's time to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love and honor and respect one another men respect your wives you respect your home bring your home together oh listen I read that again that's just wonderful that's pure gold to me men respect your wives you respect your home that would be your children to respect your home bring your home gather amen together in respect not fear in respect bring her home together because you remember this lamb we talked about of course Nexus this lamb the Paschal Lamb was for the home not just for one person that lamb that sacrifice had came for the entire house everyone that was in that dwelling that's who the lamb was formed that Paschal Lamb of the blood was supply was for everyone in that home you respect your wives you respect your home your children the whole home too had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love one another and believers should separate themselves the world notice they were not just come together to talk about the message they come together to apply the blood to apply the token that's what we you us must do amen that's what we must do apply the token let that word have its preeminence in us one more it's all Kalihi respects this is 1961 again from respect soul God and I brother Brown spurning oh god what love that Paul had he said he would become accursed that his people might be saved Oh father God give us love for one another like that give us that undying love that decency that respect for one another to be Christian enough to look over each other's mistakes with all Donald we started here with the with Romans chapter 2 Paul trying to together in the understanding we're all human we all make mistakes now brother Brown we trying to finish this up with a first we started with Paul and finished it up with brother brown he says that give us give us that undying love that decency that respect for one another to be Christian enough to look over each other's mistakes god help us because a man has has been blessed of God he might make a mistake old father let us not look at that mistake knowing that that's a precious brother that maybe Satan did in a trap or trapped him into something but if he did we pray Lord that you'll help him help he or she out of that place that we'll have love in our hearts to go after the lost sheep and bring them back to the fold grant Lord forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that have trespassed against us granite Lord lead us not temptation deliver us for evil from evil for thine is the kingdom the power the glory forever amen that faith that respect that obedience that love for one another all they made a mistake haven't you haven't we all Oh some make more mistakes and others pray for me maybe you're closer to God than they are maybe you're more Revelator than they are god help us all we can't be Aryan Saints we can't think of ourselves better more important than anybody else than any other Christian or any other believer we can't look down on the mistakes said Oh while he was wrong well let help give him the chance to make that wrong right help pray for him don't put him down don't kick him out don't take her and slander her name across the across the spectrum of Facebook or social media gives a chance does the mistakes that you've pulled out from them of the mistakes is going to be pulled out from you you don't want George being in the forefront you don't want yours blasted across some social media amen but love one another respect one another the blood of Jesus Christ is there to take care of those things and to take care of all of the the the wrong that comes from us as humana as humans and humanity but stand together in faith and love and believing I believe that's what the prayer does - the prayer faith state to see as we stand together some brothers and sisters in this cause and the cause is for Christ this cost for Christ that we have should bring us and join us together greater and more than it ever has in this last day sure I could come to you today with some great Revelation message friend I could have pulled something to you from the seals or and all those things are pertinent and needful and we will it a dividend the later time but friend how greater is that we can have all the revelations and know all the mysteries and yet not love each other Paul says you have nothing then you could understand this and you can understand that you can have a complete understanding of revelation 10 and what's attraction on the mountain and completely miss the love of God and respect for one another friend had that respect don't look at each other differently I guess you'd say just have that respect that obedience of God his word and stand upon that we have it for the Lord he has it for us as we love one another is how we love the Lord and they stand upon that and believe it forgive be forgiven pray for one another of hope hold one another and we trust it will all be healed believe again as I've said earlier that this that God keeps us hedged and keeps us hedged about and the god protects us and watches over us in his service and the god heals those that may have contracted the disease or affliction of some kind covetous one thing I mean that's just the word that's on a tip of everybody's tongue today but just because Kovac showed up doesn't mean that flu is not here or the common cold is not here or the cancer is not here or the polio or whatever for other diseases and afflictions are still around people are still meeting of other afflictions in their bodies and diseases in their in their bodies those things are just as pertinent and all those things we remember when we trust God there's many things going on today and prayer requests we had that had nothing to do with Kovac we got a mouth on fire over here sister she Leah's brother and things had nothing to do with Kovac but we're believing that God's going to move on it nevertheless we're not gonna pray for it any less or anymore than we would anything else or any other need but we believe that God is going to direct us and help us and that we hold each one and prayer and faith believing Cheng's only good is his weakest length as long as we stand together immunity and faith and God will honor that honor it as us as a congregation as a group and as humans and his love that we have for each other so let's remember that continue to respect let that respect breathe into that obedience that we have not that we look down or be biased but that we have that love that we have for each others God loved us gave his life for us Amen you have that today I trusted God and steel that in our hearts as much or more than ever because we need each other as much or more than ever and that stand upon that stand upon his word I don't know where it's gonna lead to us in these days I don't know how far it's gonna go before God calls us home I don't know how or this is going to come to as as we as individuals are I hear people have everything prognosticated but I've never seen brother bran tell specifically or the Bible but I know there's gonna come a place to at a time where it's gonna reach where God says okay that's enough and he's gonna call this bride home and every bit of Satan and hail and all the demons are gonna be unleashed upon this people god help us all we want to stand this true believers in his word your young person hold on to that because God loves you God wants you in his fold as much as he does your parents or your pastor or teachers or whatever but you hold on to that don't let the influence from other come you stand strong with what God's give you you respect that above anything else in any other opinion this world's full of opinions lot of peer pressure we used to think peer pressure is just for young people teenagers in school let me take your friend there's more peer pressure comes across the news every day than what there is in a dozen schools so god help us amen it's still the same there but the thing that we follow and look to the most is God Christ in his word he says you stand for me and I'll stand for you that's where we stand today we stand for one another so god bless you we love you appreciate you you know we're here for you I'll keep you updated on the things that are going on as much as I can through the week it looks like me and brother Roger have another pretty busy week coming up please remember to pray for one another I'll let you know what's going on my intention right now is I want to have an in-person service next Sunday again at the Holiday Inn that's my heart well see what the Lord takes that does with that that's what I want to do so we'll see how it evolves in but where the Lord takes us from here so just continue to pray for the prayer requests and hold each of each one each other in prayer and just believing in faith amen so godly recently bless you today I trust and pray the Lord said something to bless you and just and stay true upon God's Word and and have a tremendously blessed week so let's just bow our heads and we'll we'll then the streaming in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus father God delivered my heart today father to your children to your people and I trust father somehow something was said God even if it's just a word that drops down into a person's heart earlier people's heart today and Lord that it's received of us God I know it has been to me learn a lesson has been given to me father to the whole true to your word and to believe is you have that respect for one another and for your people and for Humanity god those you have here created Lord that we stand here believing that we are your extension and
