to your people today we're nothing lord without you but depending fully upon you and god your grace in our lives may this dreaming go well may it be perfectly done and lord may your hand be upon it god as i committed to you now lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and god bless you we want to go right to the scripture now if we could uh and in the scripture again we're uh getting into the mysteries of god in christ part 11 uh and god having preeminence in his people part three and uh as we have been as we begin this uh part of the teaching you wanna go to revelation chapter ten verse seven so let's just read that again if we could revelation 10 7 uh to begin this but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god should be finished as he is declared to his servants the prophets now i think we've laid quite a foundation to understand that mystery is jesus christ and who jesus christ is and the revelation of jesus christ and that and we found that in what we see here and through the scripture and and trusting god's hand upon that but we go over and of course we're talking about god having the preeminence in his people and for some reason it looks like the streaming's still uh messing up a little bit i i just don't understand i got the uh full internet going in all this time so um i'm not sure why it's not receiving enough video but anyway we're gonna keep plowing on and the colossians chapter one as we've read from about this preeminence as we read the last couple of weeks i just want to again read the seventh 18th and 19th verses as as we again draw our context for this subtext and he is before all things by him all things consist or stand and he jesus christ is the head of the body the church and that's what we've been majoring on last week probably get into a little more this week uh the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence again not just his bride although that's what we're majoring on and talking about but in all things uh we'll get to a point here we see in romans 8 where all of creation groaning waiting for the manifestation the sons of god see that in all things he would have preeminence uh they might have the previous word to please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now that priming a preeminence in that head ship is exactly what we talked about last week now i don't know how much of this got through last week with our difficulties in the streaming and all but well background just a little bit of course usually when i go through this we'll back down a little bit from last week and uh get a little bit of the highlights before we move on for this week but uh i want to want to again reiterate the the fact that the headship that was jesus christ and him being the head and him being the head of course makes him that figurative head he's not our literal head upon our shoulders but remember something as little and figuratively or an adjective as in the head of something or someone who has domain or dominion over someone or some group of people just like the body is a literal you can look at my head literally you can look at my body literal body's also an adjective or figurative or there's large groups of people or large uh gathering of water is called a body of water so we recognize those two things but as he is the head being that head he is the head of the church he is the head of uh uh of all things of of his church and of course in that he has the preeminence he is the head of the body the church amen so he is our head praise the lord so we're thankful god is our head so now we go from there go back to as we read this uh the other day and getting into remember there's several places in the scripture that refers to this of course jesus referred to it and matthew mark luke talked about luke last week for a moment but of course david you go all the way back to psalms 118 and david prophesying about jesus christ uh talking about the cheap cornerstone or the the stone that was laid not those that were rejected by the builders the builders now in acts chapter four we'll pick this up again real quick and go through this in acts chapter four uh we want to begin we're reading with verse eight then peter this is after the impotent man was healed uh peter in the name of the lord jesus then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him dot this man stand here before you whole amen again peter was not ashamed to declare jesus christ anymore he stands before you hold this is jesus christ is the stone which was said it not of you builders which has become the head of the corner again for just a moment that stone jesus christ remember we're going to read the scripture again where he talks about that stone is the foundation of the church that it was being built upon he is that stone which was said it not now remember again not is to be rejected or despised or deplorable unwanted so when something comes and you put it at not that means that you discard it you do not regard it in any way it has no value to you so what peter is saying that you took and you crucified the one by whom the name on me that i spoke made this man whole you put him aside you put him at not you rejected him see so he said you put them at not of you builders now again what is that builders he's talking about that builders is the ones he's saying that you are the religious leaders you are the priests you are the pastors you are the ministers you are the ones that are supposed to be laying having that foundation laid which is jesus christ to build that church upon you're the ones to bring the word to those people you are the ones to preach the gospel to those people and you are the builders of getting those people built or edified to a place of being a part of the body of jesus christ built and edified and and grow in the lord to make that building to make those people a place inhabitable of jesus christ see they were the ones responsible for that all the builders those that consider themselves ministers or religious uh godly godly people or as we'd say today christians uh religious leaders you're the builders you're supposed to be the ones that are edifying these people you're the supposed to be the ones giving them the pure unadulterated word of the hour the present day truth you're supposed to be the ones helping these people build up to a place of faith our original scripture is that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel master what does that mean that means there's going to be a day when a prophet is going to come and bring a present-day truth to bring and at the end time seventh day is going to take into a rapture so those are the builders that he's talking about and you've taken he's talking you've taken jesus christ your religious leaders have taken jesus christ and discarded him you've built your foundation your church on something else oh sure you've got beautiful buildings oh sure you got beautiful stained glass windows and beautiful steeples and you got these beautiful fineries you got them packed full of people but what does it really mean when it comes down to it if your foundation is not laid on jesus christ well friend the foundation of any build is the most important part you know we major on the fineries we like how beautiful it is we paint it often we put carpet or the the lights whatever we find we make it look beautiful and there's nothing wrong with that but without a steady foundation remember the wise man the wise man built his house upon what a stone the rock the rock now if you talk about a natural house of course there's got to be a solid foundation you talk about your spiritual life that that rock has got to be jesus and not just again some trinity or second person but but the revelation of jesus christ is god almighty and flesh it's a revelation it's who he is is the mystery of god that's being revealed in this last day you have rejected him and you builders have built your buildings your churches your denominations your spiritual of foundations buildings you built among seeking sands if they're not built on jesus christ if they're not built on who jesus christ is isn't the revelation of who he is not just a you know something just a good man or prophet but god almighty himself got to be built on that foundation because in there is all the mysteries that he goes from reveals from from that point see he has become now the head of the corner we talked about that corner last week what is the corner of the corner the foundation stone cornerstone song of the building is the building that uh is a stone that holds the weight of the building it's the is the foundation of the building so we find out he's the head of the head cornerstone she's the cornerstone foundation he's also the head of the building he comes in caps we talked about last week pyramid and the captain of the pyramid showed you american dollar of course it never has been capped never will be capped because america rejected him right the all-seeing eye they rejected him so if they rejected him it will never be capped but he is coming to cap and he has capped a bride and brought that that headship down on the bride remember philippians 2 says let this might be in you which was also in christ jesus that capstone headstone to come so he is the author the foundation the cheap cornerstone and the finisher the capstone the finishing product of that building is the top the the capstone see when they make the pyramids built them that capstone was the last thing to come on and because that is the finisher so he's the author and the finisher so he has the ones that was rejected jesus christ the stone that was rejected was said it not of the builders has become the head of the corner he is the one that's in charge of this whole thing upon that that his church is being built now neither is there any salvation any other for nath for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved but at the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ now remember that that foundation is the most important foundation of ability or is the most important part of the building is the foundation we go back and pick this up again in in matthew chapter 16 thought it was important enough to read to us again today in matthew 16 17 jesus uh let's go up to 13 again we read when jesus came the coast of cesarean philippi he asked the disciples saying who to men say i the son of man am they said some say that thou are john the baptist some elias others jeremiah so one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that i am who do you say that i am that's the most important thing because it's individual it's it's up to you see and simon peter answered said thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee you get it seminary but god my father which is in heaven he has revealed it to you god revealed it to peter what's up you learned what something you got in the book or school or seminary god revealed it to him who jesus christ was so what does that tell us it tells us that the only way that a person could get to an understanding of jesus christ and who he is is through revelation of jesus of jesus christ by god that's the only way you can get it this comes by revelation has to be personally given god to you see revealed to you personally my father which is in heaven i see unto thee thou art petered upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it one of the most great scriptures there for the church to hinge upon to to have trust in faith in sea because if your foundation is built on jesus christ the gates of hell cannot prevail against you now it may try to buffet you but it can't overcome you it can't overtake you it can't uh consume you see now if your foundation's not built upon the revelation of who jesus christ is then of course your foundation is just going to wash away then what do you have building is going to crumble to the ground the gates of hell can prevail or overcome anything that's built on anything other than the true revelation of who jesus christ is that's why he desires to have that preeminence in his body he does it through the revelation of his word and his life his spirit coming in us his spirit is in you he has proved that he's approved of you and that revelation comes from god to realize who he is and the gates of hell no matter how much satan tries to come against you he cannot prevail over you he cannot prevail it is impossible because it would be against the word and god doesn't go against his word god doesn't transgress his word so it has to be that god those that are on that founder cannot prevail i know maybe sometimes you've been in some trials and some tests and it felt like you were being prevailed over but trust me you were not you could not be not if your foundation's in the right place built upon that stone that rock that the builders religious leaders rejected built upon that can't prevail there's no way it can prevail against you because that's what the word says cannot prevail see and again that foundation that foundation is the most important part of the building people try to go to church and they try to get baptized and they try to do all kinds of stuff and then all that's fine you know they try to live a good religious life they try to go to church and try to be faithful and and again all those things are fine and dandy friend but if it's not built on that sure foundation if it's not built on the revelation of jesus christ and that mystery of who he is then it's not going to hold it's not going to stand you go read the the parable that that jesus gives the sower the seed you know the sea goes here and it can't hold and it throws out here and it can't hold it goes here and it can't hold wine because it has no foundation it has no root seeming the seed has to when the seed go forth the seed has to have the kind of ground that's going to allow the root to dig into it so it has a foundation so it has something to hold it so all the tests and the trials and the hardships come it's got something to hold it see now all the others they go by the wayside they burn the sun or something like that there's got to be a foundation there's then when that foundation is there then it doesn't matter the winds can blow and the the the uh the toil can come and and satan can do whatever he wants but that that with that foundational hole it'll hold every time and it'll hold every time see you go to you go to certain places where they have a lot of hurricanes you go to california they have a lot of earthquakes you know it used to be a big earthquake with crumbled buildings like nothing big hurricane with level grounds and they still do sometimes but but man has gotten smarter and they built a little better foundation so a 5.0 earthquake won't crumble buildings as much anymore used to but it won't anymore because they've gotten smarter but see god doesn't get smarter that's why the foundation that we lay in him is perfect it's right and it will hold regardless of the circumstances regardless of what comes that's the most important part it isn't now forgive me i don't mean this the wrong way but it isn't necessarily just getting baptized it isn't necessarily just going to church isn't necessarily just reading your bible all those things are wonderful good things please don't get me wrong that's absolutely what a christian should do but you got to get that foundation right first that foundation has got to be right that's christ in you the hope of glory that's you in the new birth coming into you settling that foundation packing it to where whatever comes on it it'll hold i remember one time i was in business back in charlotte and we had gotten into a new building we moved to the south part of charlotte we got in this building and it was still developing and i could look out my office window and look out they were going to build a building up on a little it's kind of a little ledge up there but it was kind of a hill they brought bulldozers and earth movers in there and they begin to to take that land they begin to flatten it out and then they brought other dirt in and stuff and put it down there and for literal what seemed like weeks or maybe even months they had these big huge equipments going back and forth and back and forth across all that land back and forth back and forth and you know for a moment i thought why they keep doing that day after day after day and then it dawned on me and the scriptural and the spiritual application they had to pack that thing down good to where that foundation was solid so when they built that big old building on top of it it wasn't just gonna crumble down with the first storm to come along that's what happens to a lot of people they don't get their foundation right and the first one that comes along they're building crumbles down quit going to church they leave god or whatever and you know sometimes they build a good enough foundation that it holds for a while but when a real hard trial hits then there comes the building but if it's built on jesus christ the rock revelation the revelation here jesus telling peter the revelation who he is is built on that it doesn't matter what storms come it doesn't matter what hardships are life what trials tribulations it will hold it will keep you amen people ask you know when brother branham went through that with his wife and his daughter and his first wife hope and sharon rose and when they passed away and they said through all that you went through brother brown bill uh how were you able to keep your religion he said i didn't it kept me it kept me that's having the right foundation friend when you can't keep it when you'd rather die than draw your neck your next breath that foundation will hold you amen that's why that foundation has got to be there baptism is fine reading the bible going to church all those good things those are prosperous things but that foundation has got to be there first amen i know i'm laying that foundation pretty hard right now but we're going to build on that foundation here i want to start building on that foundation for the body that jesus is having the preeminence over that body that we are a part of see because that that that brings us to that knowledge and understanding who are we who am i who are you who who are these people that are called the bride around the world who are they see but that foundation's got to be right first it's got to be right and then we can and then you can build then you can build on that building see it's got to come from that first amen now let's go to uh ephesians ephesians chapter 2 we read last week again some of this would be with the way the streaming was going and all i i kind of skipped through some of it and we'll just uh lay a little bit better but i want to put that foundation in there friend that foundations no matter who you are you're listening and watching this that foundation has got to be settled it's got to be right without that your building will crumble without that the gates of hell can prevail over you not just come against you but prevail that means coming out victorious over you that foundation's got to be right first it's not in a church it's not a pastor it's not a preacher it's not a prophet or some kind of gift he said the word jesus christ that foundation it's got to be their revelation now uh arabia excuse me ephesians chapter 2. [Music] amen let's read this ephesians chapter 2 verse 20. uh let's just begin with verse 19 ephesians 2 19. now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation built upon the foundation let's get this building going up now amen it's nice to have the foundation good foundation solid foundation but you don't just you don't just stand there and stare at the foundation you can't inhabit a foundation god can inhabit a foundation he's got to inhabit a building and you are that building individually and as a worldwide body god inhabits amen now that it's got to be a building so we are built upon the foundation and we got that foundation lane now we're being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets those that have the word uh jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone which we've just uh reiterated and gone into jesus and being the chief cornerstone so how can he be the cornerstone of the building and the head of the building because he is the author the beginner the alpha and he is the finisher the omega the ending amen in whom all the building again we get into this all the building fitly framed together now if you're the house of jesus christ it's all fitly framed together groweth unto and and as a body of believers worldwide remember my body and the body of believers worldwide see we're all part of the same mystical body of jesus christ we're all a part of it worldwide you know friends sometimes we just you know we really got to get out of this this mindset of my foreign no more that we uh uh uh devolved into sometimes that we that we go into sometimes uh sometimes we get into this thing that it's just me or it's just my family or it's just my church or it's just here in the state or in this country friend there's pride around the world it's got to always be our thought vision understanding bride around the world and those people over there are just as much bright as you and i are they are just as much a part of this body as you and i are there may be eyes over there there may be fingers toes torsos there may ears nose there maybe i don't know but we all make up the mystical body of jesus christ around the world and it's just like your body if you stub your toe your whole body hurts when something goes wrong the whole body reacts to it even in your bloodstream those if i get this right those white blood cells you cut your fingers up and go they all rush from the body go right to that hard spot why because the body knows if he can fix that one part then the whole body will be complete again that's the way we should be as a body a body of believers the building remember this fitly frame together building that groweth together remember what brother braham said it's fitly building it's fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord remember again i said last week brother talked about those pyramids and how those rocks were so hewn out and and laid together that you couldn't run a razor blade between them and i believe that's the way the bride is no matter how much satan tries to carve us up there's not a razor blade can come and separate a brother from sister sister sister brother brother because that's the way god has set this building together that's the way this building is fit together can't run a razor blade and it's growing together see if you build a house the foundation is the most important part but if you're building a house the house has to be plumb and square right i mean you can have a good foundation and which is the most important part but if you start building the building you say well i got a revelation of jesus christ and you know i'm going to go somewhere that doesn't teach the pure word then you're going to have a leaning tower of pisa the building is supposed to be plum and square it's supposed to be exactly on angle and and level everything about the building so it's holds better it's fitly framed together for that purse for that purpose so it has to be not just the word it's got to be the spirit too but it can't just be the spirit it's got to be the word too it's got to be the mechanics and the dynamics together it's got to be the spirit and the word that's together that that building is is growing in it has to be plumb and square it has to be the holy spirit and the word that's growing amen as you're bringing this building up as it's growing it's fitly framed together palm and square holy spirit and the word growing into a holy temple in the lord in whom ye are are also are building together for a habitation of god through the spirit becoming a habitation of god through the spirit again you can't have potato of literally a foundation has to be a building it's got to be a building that's going to hold it's got to be a square plum building it's got to be on the revelation of the word and it's got to be by the holy spirit unto the habitation of god in you through the spirit god inhabiting you now not just me but each one of us together again this body around the world when one part of the body grows all the body grows right when one part of the body hurts all the body hurts when one part of the body is in need the whole body is in need it's just like we were talking about it has to be the whole body together that's why this body is what it is to be the inhabitant place of god that by the spirit god come and inhabit it it's got to be according to the the specifications of the word as god has laid out to us amen so it's all around the world now let's move on first corinthians first corinthians chapter three first corinthians chapter three we'll just begin with verse one and we're gonna build this building we're going to try to get this building built today and then we'll we'll end it we'll end with that let's start building it here we already got here it says it's built fitly framed together it's fitly framed together to bring forth the habitation of god through the spirit now first corinthians chapter 3 and i brother could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with me for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able remember brother graham said the corinthian church's most spiritually weak church ephesian church was the strongest uh spiritually strong church so you know paul's telling them i had to feed you with milk as babes things i want to tell you i couldn't tell you even so now i can't tell you because you're not able to receive it third verse for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you ending strife division are ye not carnal and walk as men for while one saith i'm of paul and another i am apollos are you not carnal oh god help us that same spirit today who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers builders if you will by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollo's water god gave the increase amen foundation was late never has to be the foundation we just read the apostles and prophets laid jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone but it's god that gives the increase it's god that continues to keep this building growing because it's god is the one that reveals the word to you because this is a word body it's a word building it's built on the word it is built by the word because it is the word so that building it's god that gives the increase one planet the other water i mean i've said this several times to our church and you've heard me say this i think they should change the name of the revelation seven seal book that's just my personal opinion because it's not the revelation seven six it's the truth of the seven seals delivered by a prophet god inspired anointed to the truth to bring it to a people but it's only a revelation if god gives you that revelation see paul planted apollos water brother branham planted ministers water but it takes god to get the increase it takes god to bring the revelation brother branham could not give you revelation paul could not give anybody revelation paul could not give anybody revelation it takes god to give it and that's where the increase comes the faith comes by hearing and hearing the word absolutely that's the ministry that lays it out the planting the watering but it takes god to bring the increase of that faith faith comes by hearing the word but god gives the increase god brings the revelation to you so as the words being ministered as the words being brought to you god is revealing it to you as god reveals it to you it just adds another block it adds another brick it adds another stone it adds another two by four wall ceiling whatever it adds to that body praise the lord and as that body goes forth god gives the increase so neither verse 7 now so neither is he that planteth anything in other words paul's saying i'm nothing neither is he that watereth apollos is nothing but god they giveth the increase there's god that brings the revelation so it's only so it's god's church so god's the one in charge of it so god takes care of it amen he's the one that gives the increase that's where it comes from amen we're just here to be by the revelation preeminence of jesus christ in us to bring that word to bring that truth to witness to other people to help other people we can't save anybody we can't reveal the word to anybody we can lead them to it we can help them and maybe explain it to them as god has revealed it to us but even in explaining it you can't reveal it to somebody oh sure they might get some kind of a head knowledge to say oh i i see what you mean but that's not a revelation revelation when it becomes part of you amen it becomes part of i've told you my definition of that many times but when it becomes a part of you man that's a revelation and nobody can take that from you and nobody can take that from you god gives the increase now he that planted paul he that water apollos are one are one together united every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor now the first thing that that that paul is trying to bring here to help them understand is look there's no division here there's no chisholm there's no separation there's no ending there's no hatred me and apollos are one yeah i mean he may be going here and doing what the lord called him to do and i'm going here and doing what the lord called me to do this brother's going here doing what the lord called him to do and that's all right that's fine god leads every man according as he will but we're one well one in him and if you're if your building is on that foundation you're built upon the revelation of jesus christ the mystery of god and that foundation of who jesus is not just a church not just a building you're built on we're one we're brothers around the world internationally we're one we're all a part of this same mystical body of jesus christ we're all one and paul's telling them here menopause aren't at odds with each other we're brothers we're one in this one's watering one's planting one's doing this and that but in all that god gives the increase amen god gives the increase praise the lord for we are for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry now that's a strange word isn't it especially considering if you think on it because considering that we're considered the bride of jesus christ which is feminist by designation because bride woman if i hear he's saying that paul is saying you are god's husbandry ye are god's building but what is a what is a husbandry a husbandry is simply a worker a laborer a fellow servant that's all a husbandry is someone who kills the ground someone who is in labor for the lord is someone who is doing the work and the bidding of the lord jesus it's just someone that is out being led of the spirit and god is leading them to do his work for him on this earth we are his husbandry look it again let's read it again see here now he said together we are uh together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building praise the lord we are his workmen we're here because to allow god to have the preeminence in us he is the head of this body so that in that we are his building to do his work we have a work to do continuing he said well we're at the end time yes we are and it may be a different work than than even a hundred years ago maybe a different work than it was even 50 years ago but it's still a job it's still a work it's still some there's a reason why we're still here there's a reason why this bride is still here and whatever that reason is i i you know that's up to god i mean the full aspect of that reason is totally up to god it's not up to me so i'm just here to do what he called me to do and my part of that you're here to do that part that god's called you to whatever that is now i i can't say that you're not doing what god's called you to do because god calls you to that not me now if it's something unscriptural or some uh the the it's not following the message of the word or something that that's totally different but if you're a fellow laborer uh part of the husbandry or one day we're just doing the job god called us to do you may not be on that street or in that city or in that state or in that country but you're doing what god called you to do and that's all god expects of any of us because we are his building let 10th first out according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another build it thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon we have to make sure that how we build upon that foundation is based upon the revelation of the word of the hour based upon god bringing his word as he is remember again the foundation of the apostles and prophets in the days of the voice of the seventh angel messenger prophet the mystery of god should be finished that foundation will be built this body will be there upon so we have to be careful how we're building upon that foundation we have to make sure that it's according to the word it's according to the message it's according to the spirit of god in our lives and as leading us see you say well god's called me to do this that's fine and dandy but just make sure that you absolutely know that's what god's calling you to do that's that's just all there is to it just make sure you know what this is what god told me to do well make sure that's what he told you to do there's nothing wrong with that that's good we all be led of the lord but make sure see paul's saying take heed how you're building thereof don't go with you know some another man's revelation even in the message is that what's you know he's a message minister that's fine but that's not your foundation that's not your building see you your building is based on the revelation god gives you now it would certainly match if it's a word and if we're one it's going to match together but don't take it just because it's somebody else's revelation it's got to be your revelation and your revelation as we are one together should match the revelation of the word together amen but don't do it just because it was revealed to them amen don't preach something just because another brother preached it let god reveal it god reveals it then that's a different story see take heed how you build their own for a other foundation can no man lay than that it is laid which is jesus christ and other people try to lay other foundations you say oh oh we're christians oh well we're in the message we we listen to the we listen to the tapes we go to church every week that's all fine and good but what is your foundation what is your building being built upon just based on what somebody else has told you just based on what you've heard on the tape or is it coming because you have a personal relationship with jesus christ yourself and the revelation that god is giving to you that is building your building that is building the building the group building as you build we all build right remember we're all a part of the same body so but but if it's not built on that then what is it built upon because it was i voted on jesus christ but then deny the word or or give us some other man's uh religion or revelation or yours it's got to be something that's according to the according to the word not not something that is uh uh um my idea or my opinion or or my personal vendetta or something it's got to be based on the word amen it's got to be based on what your revelation is that god has revealed to you god is brought and given to you now i want to read a couple more scriptures here if we can we'll get to them if we can i might have to leave off that second when time's getting away from us but i want to go to first corinthians 12 now again we're building that building we're building that building first corinthians chapter 12. we were just in chapter uh three but i want to go to chapter 12 now and begin reading with verse 12. and it goes into the spiritual gifts of course revel um first corinthians 12 and first corinthians 14 go into the spiritual gifts a lot uh which we've taught on but we're going to forgo that right now and just get into the body part of it because that's the part that i believe that paul is majoring on he's not really even necessarily majoring on the gifts which brother brahm said you can't major on a minor so we don't major on the gifts you may draw on the word uh you can't major on a minor but what paul is i believe really getting to the people here and you can look at it we're going to read starting with verse 12 and most of this chapter is about the body it's about us being a body together let's just read it here first corinthians 12 12 whereas the body is one and has many members that's us and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ christ's body is a many member body not just a myford no more it's so easy to get into that mindset friend but that's not what it's about it's not my fault no more it's not just my church my city my state it's around the world i want to get that heart to us because we got to remember that people i've heard people say well there's got to be persecution in this bride how do you know there's not there's bride around the world if they're sitting over there in china and they have to renounce jesus christ although the real believers aren't and and swear alliances and put up his picture in their house and take down jesus and everything else throw the bibles away and stuff that they're being persecuted i mean we don't know what's happening in some of these countries necessarily are all together i mean there is persecution in this pride you may not necessarily be personally feeling it exactly the way they are but they're part of the body they're part of us they're a part of me we're a part of each other if they're being persecuted i'm being persecuted amen it's not just my home not just my church family it's around the world we're all in this together paul's trying to make that very strong here our one body so also is christ 13th verse 4 by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews gentiles whether it be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit jesus christ that mystery of god for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not an eye i am not of the body it is therefore not a part of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole body were hearing where is the smelly see we're all we all play that very important part of of god having the preeminence in each one of us we can't hear without him we can't smell that but we got to do our part to bring about the smell and to bring about the hearing to bring about the planting to bring about the water god give the increase amen we're not all ears we're not all prophets we're not all ministers we're not all strong speakers or we all have our separate things that god works through us but now i have god set the members every one of them in the body as it had pleased him as it had pleased god so you can't say oh wait i i don't want to be in here i want to be a knight that's not up to you well i don't want to do this it's not up to you if you're going to live you are not of yourself you are not of your own you're bought with a price you we do what god tells us to do we do what he leads us and shows us to do sure we're free moral agents that's the good part about it we can do whatever we want we just choose to do what god tells us to do what god wants us to do that's that's where it comes that's the most pleasing thing to him he does he does it through us because we are willing subjects he doesn't force us to do anything but we do it because we want him to do it we want to be pleasing to him so he has said each one of the bodies that pleased him and if they were all one member where would the body or what if everybody was brother branham what part with all the rest of us play that we need to do that everything else needs to be done everybody can't just be a brain what good is a brain laying on the sidewalk it may be the best brain ever god made but what good does it do without a body to go in it for it to go into what what good is it if it's hearing the eyes to seeing the smell what what good does the rest of it do i mean what good is the whole head if he's laying on the sidewalk gotta have a body and if you were all one member where were the body and now all and now are they many members yet but one body i cannot say into the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you may much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary they're very necessary they may not be behind the pulpit they may not be shining and and be the one that everybody looks to or whatever or the one that's most popular or that but you know every little piece to the very bottom of the skin on the bottom of your foot is important to go on we're all a part of the same mystical body of jesus christ if you're a part of the body that's all that really matters when you get down to the end of it when you're at the end of the road when god pulls your number when it's time to go home that's all that really matters that's all that's going to matter to you friend and those members of the body which think they are less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our and our own comedy parts have more abundant compliments god is thankful even if it's just a cup of water even if it's just a little labor or just a little of money or something whatever it is god blesses it our accompli parts have no need but god had tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no chisholm in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another god help us all are we are can i say this are we ever going to get to that place yeah yeah that means that we of course because we're all part of the same body it will amen when i i don't know it sounds rough though doesn't it but i want to go back to the 24th verse real quick and look at this word temper our comedy parts have no need but god had tempered the body together they ever looked at that word that's a fusing together that's a that's a tempering together tempering even means to if you use a temperature to melt something and to bring even a couple of metals together you can melt metals and bring them together as one metal there's work called vulcanizing i think they use in the maybe entire manufacturing or something where they literally put something under such pressure or under such heat that they can bring two separate things together now i'm not a scientist i don't these specifics terms or whatever but actually bring those two elements and make them one element together that one element to serve whatever purpose it is an entire or whatever i don't know metals together or something bring them temper them together put them under such pressure and heat that it tempers them well god is saying here uh paul is saying that god had tempered the body together god has put the pressure god has put the heat to bring this and unify this body together in such a place that again when one part hurts that all the body hurts when one part's sick all the body's sick when one part is in persecution the whole body is being persecuted amen because we're part of the same body tempered tempering that body together having more abundant honor that part which lack because we're all a part of the same body together now that vulcanized that temporized body has come together to be one serves that purpose even though we're many member body we're vulcanized together we're tempered together by the word for the purpose of bringing forth the revelation that jesus christ the mystery of god no now 25th first again there should be no schism in the body no separation no division amen we're one again tempered together but that members should have the same care one for another no uh of one over the other uh no respect for persons we should have the same care one for another we should care just as much for that person in china as you do for your own family your own church we should care about that one in russia or in or north korea or wherever they are friend they're from every nation tongue kindred people we should carry them as much as we do our own home much as we do our own church and family and people because we're together care same one for them whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now ye of the body of christ and members in particular was rolled together now we've got that body that body that's been built that body's been built it's it's it's laid its foundation this body's still the spiritual house it gets built all the time it can or we'll just say it's built but it's refining god refines it all the time see just like he does the body bride body refining all the time still building still coming together we're all part of the same body i mean when that last one comes in from we know the rapture takes place when is that i mean has it already taken place we don't know but i do know that that whole body is going to come fitly framed together joined together this holy spirit the spirit of god the mechanics and dynamics vulcanizing and bringing her together it's brought together the auspice of jesus christ the word because she is the word and the revelation that word having the preeminence in you making you that that preeminence today that god is called that god is orchestrated that god would have the headship of remember what we said last week what is that headship is the master you look and read it find the definition master and lord the lord to your lord it's your master is that foundation jesus christ the revelation of who jesus christ is not again not because some of denomination but is it the revelation of jesus to you personally in obedience to god's word the fullness of god's word not a few select scriptures not just the new testament but the word the complete word all the word god revealing it because he's the one that gives the increase increase god reveals that to you god shows that to you now importance the importance to understanding you can't reveal something to you you don't know you have to know it first faith first faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god but you got to hear it first you have to read it first it has to be a part of your life first you can't just think that you could live on going to church or watching a stream service or something it has to be you in your revelation relationship with jesus christ on a daily basis that god then can reveal it to you because then that's where the increase comes bringing that building up plumbing square mechanics dynamics holy spirit and work together making that building a perfect place now you've got a building that's on a beautiful foundation jesus christ the revelation of who he is and a beautiful building his word in being the chief cornerstone that building come up in in by the spirit of the word into a beautiful place that's the habitation of god himself god living in you through the spirit living in each one of us as a body and as individuals god living in us because we're all a part of one body together we're all a part of that same mystical body amen that's what god's brought us together that building that's that's plum and square god has made that a habitation of himself we are one all one one body together in jesus christ amen love one another uphold one another and pray the prayer of faith shall save the sick because we bind together with amen god remembers i'm gonna hold off the scripture the last scripture reading i had here for next week it kind of was gonna take enough add on to take a little different direction we'll do that next week so we bring it in from there and just trust the lord help us with it lead us to the place that he wants us to be amen and hopefully next week that will be in our own building looking forward to it amen i pray something was said today to bless you uh god has been so good to us trust the lord bless your weak and keep you prosperous and healthy and strong and keep us hedged from all the germs diseases afflictions everything around us friend you know i was praying i believe it was yesterday i can't remember for sure but you know it's just talking to the lord i was thinking lord how it is it seems and it just came on my mind how it is it seems that you know we used to live in florida and that's kind of hurricane territory we had a hurricane come through and uh we're kind of skirted where we lived but they always talked about the eye of that hurricane you look at a real good form very dangerous hurricane there's a big beautiful eye using right in the middle of that thing that everything's swirling around but you look in the middle of that eye and in the middle of all that swirling wind 100 mile an hour tornadoes lightning thunder rain wind in the middle it's just just calm is it it's just very little no wind even the sun will poke through that little hole that you can even look up in the middle of that and you'll be right in the middle of the hurricane you look up and there's the sun i thought lord i feel that way a lot of times just sitting in that eye i feel like we kind of are that as his people as his bride sitting in that eye there with the world swirling all around us and everything that's going on violence and the the the politics and the and the covet everything is happening all that's just swirling all around we're sitting here right in that eye looking up at the sunshine calm winds because that's how our lives are with jesus now sometimes we stick our arm out or get our leg out or something and we we're getting some of those tumultuous winds and stuff but god helps us get back to that eye helps us get back to that place and everything around us is just seems like going crazy i mean it literally just seems like it's going crazy some pretty we know by the word what was going to happen we know what brother branham told us but it's it i'll be honest for me it it's just challenging for me to watch i it disturbs me uh but i love god love his people i'm so thankful he keeps us in the eye of that storm keeps us the words a lot of times he keeps us calm you know if we can have faith and belief now got to have faith in believer there's no calm and then god keeps us there and keeps us protected amen so thankful god is so good to us we love you god bless you appreciate you being a part of our service today let's just buy our heads if we could for
