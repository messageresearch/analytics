us more more of him amen praise the lord jesus want to go to the lord in prayer now amen take these prayer requests before the lord here today we have actually quite a few sister julie wrote a couple out here that she wanted to make mention she said that her sister christian is in pain with her joints she had a cardiologist appointment tuesday for long covered symptoms please continue in prayer for her quick healing uh and no symptoms amen praise the lord also sister julie said that she has her belly is hurting really bad right now so amen so we want to remember sister julian praise the lord the lord god would touch her amen and heal her right now amen sister norma sent me a request to prayer for sister judy arnold's friend malia that we prayed for last week who's having open heart surgery this past week she's had some serious complications and we want to remember her in prayer she's having a difficult time with the surgery that she went through so let's she's still alive she went through the surgery but again the complications that sister judy said uh that her friend malia is having so we want to remember continue to remember her in prayer the lord would just be mindful on that situation also brother dennis text me sister leah his wife's not been feeling very well and they went to the emergency room last night or to urging care i'd have to find the text again that she went to an emergency facility last night they were there for an hour and a half ran all kinds of tests everything came back negative so the doctor is telling her that she probably has the beginning stages of coba even though she tests negative for covet uh bottom line is covered not coping fluid whatever whatever the dev the name of that devil is she's not feeling well uh so brother dennis is home with her today so we want to remember the both of them in prayer but of course for a quick uh complete healing for his wife leah this morning thor would just touch her amen and also had some requests uh that uh sister sheila sent and shariah sent me a little later for their home situation they're trying to sell their home art and tries trying to sell their home have an appointment tomorrow with somebody so they're hoping to be able to sell it tomorrow they have an appointment or a contract on a house that they're trying to purchase at aina and i-10 as she sent me so we want to just pray and trust that that goes well it's the lord's will god will open the door for them and bless them in it they've wanted to move up on that part of town for a long time now and they found them a place so i'm just trusting is the will of the lord so please remember them in prayer but also school starting back for the children i guess tuesday for gabriel and dallas and next monday for joel and then next monday and so the kids are yeah sorry back to school so i want to remember them in prayer of course joel's still at home but uh gabriel is going to go to a charter school up in miranda so please remember them in prayer if you would the children are i hate to say this but i don't have a huge amount of confidence or educational system anymore public schools especially but just believing god as he handled us and our children and them and god will just make a way and put them in the right place the right facility the right teachers the right everything so that it goes perfectly well with them as as well so amen let's remember them in prayer if you would praise the lord and i'm trying to make sure i remembered everything i try to write everything down anyone have a spoken request i forgot to write down this and i don't i don't like speaking it out i always want to write it down um but we are actually dealing with somebody smoking in our building um it's really bad and i was talking to sister norma and she said sister judy arnold deals with loud music and so you know those i just feel like those demons are getting more and more rampant and um legality-wise it's on our side because we are in a designated non-smoking building so um if you can just please pray those just to rebuke those and give us some peace i my heart just goes out to sister judy and yes this is just it's just awful it's awful and and more brazen too yes those demons are getting more worries than they used to be you used to kind of lurk around the shadows and the corners and stuff but they're just those demons are right in your face anymore and they really don't care uh you you might even find the smoker and tell them to quit and they'll who knows what they would do they just don't care anymore uh but greater is he that's in us in the world i mean we serve a living god it can handle and take care of any of those situations so remember that prayer sister norma's not here because her car's uh acting up and she's got a mechanic they're working on it hopefully she said they'll have it done uh this week so please remember sister norman in prayer i haven't heard the freyjo's i believe they're doing well but just trade lord just touched them and anyone sisterly and lydia those who may not be here praise the lord remember them in prayer as well so i appreciate your prayers over this last week the lord help me give me strength to do what we need to do to do the job amen good flights and everything went well and i know it was the prayer the prayers of the saints that go before the lord that keep everything well so uh there's a lot more to those stories but i will uh we'll just move on with our service today i'll maybe sometime later i can explain things but uh but all is well by the grace of god amen praise the lord so let's stand to our feet if we could you'd have an unspoken request in your heart glad the pats are back with us i'm believing they got their pipes fixed and we're just believing there's no more weak spots and everything's gonna be fine with their blowing now amen so thankful that god is mindful of dear lord we bring these requests to you because we now that you hear as far as you are amen yes lord i ask that you go out to each of these needs lord and these families these individuals that need a touch and intervene we need you to intervene in there yes take full control lord bring healing and comfort and peace and amen praise the lord jesus you can be seated if you'd like my praise my praise report and be thankful to the lord for uh blessing and bringing me back home thank the lord it was a good week it's a hard week we put over 60 hours in this last week uh my flight is you know got delayed and uh i got to atlanta at one o'clock monday morning got about four hours sleep so i had to catch a flight from there to go to fort myer the next day and then uh got there had somebody got to the hotel went to the job and worked till after nine o'clock that night and nine o'clock five to six to nine the next night and next day anyway um the lord was mindful though we got everything done the job went great we started washing cards and so that was the main thing amen so i appreciate the lord for that and his goodness i also don't i should say this out loud but i saw ali at the airport when i got there last sunday and she bumped me to first class that was so sweet of her i was so thankful i tell you i told her i said i was glad she did but almost glad wish he hadn't because god can get used to that and it's a way more money than to actually buy a first class than i uh am able to so but it was a real blessing i appreciated her doing that also michael wrote a couple of testimonies we'll go into testimony is it not all can you hear me okay testimonies micah had a couple of testimonies he wanted to give for me to read to you uh the first one is early last week i can't remember the exact day i was walking on the river walk and i had to step off the path get out of the way of people i stood there and just looked at the desert then i looked down and about three feet to my left was a fairly large diamondback rattlesnake curled up sleeping i want to thank the lord that i didn't get much closer and he kept the snake asleep protecting me amen and we kind of had that we went there last year went over by la canada where when the river was flowing so heavy and the snake just come right by in front of us big rattle big diamond back his second testimony i began feeling ill thursday morning but i was able to go to work then that evening i began feeling really uh pretty bad i called i called out of work friday and slept most of the day friday and saturday i text my family yesterday afternoon and told them unless god sees fit to do a miracle i won't be able to make make it to church tomorrow shortly after texting my mom said she sent out a prayer request and i know some of you went to prayer because about 15 minutes later i suddenly began to feel the strength come to me and the symptoms i was experiencing started to let up i could feel the prayers moving the hand of god there's a reason the bible instructs us to pray for each other we serve a miracle-working god praise the lord praise the lord thank god for that he's mindful of us isn't he amen done a lot of praying for micah slept a lot yesterday myself so but thank god the lord is mindful of us isn't he amen in the prayers of the saints avail much before the lord so thank god for that amen he is our protection and we'll sing one more song here number 38 and before we change the order of service praise the lord draw me nearer praise the lord number 38 draw me here and he wants to be drawn nearer to him today amen that's where healing is that's where salvation is that's where all the blessings of god lay dear to him [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] to thy precious [Music] if [Music] to thy precious [Music] let me [Music] knees [Music] here [Music] [Applause] and there are depths of love [Music] there are heights of joy till i rest in peace [Music] to thy precious [Music] to thy precious [Music] amen praise the lord jesus amen we just want to be closer to him more like him more in his image praise the lord jesus who wants to be drawn closer to him so that we can manifest that love we can manifest that life to manifest that spirit to others around us they may not understand it they might not know what it is we manifest it to them that they can understand amen and see that there is still a living risen savior jesus christ who's the same today as he's always has been amen praise the lord jesus and you don't have a testimony this morning on your heart yeah there was more to the broken water fight that meets the eye the same water pipe he's breaking and i thought it was the same place that i fixed last time so i called somebody to help but meanwhile this big old rattlesnake crawled under there oh oh and he was right there with the where you couldn't get to fix it and uh i hit him with a shovel he struck the shovel six times and and then he just called back there and called up right underneath the leak we're in a bad place here i'm not going under there and we called for help and this uh this guy came out and i don't know i think there's a rattlesnake under there and he went in there picks it all up he says was it your fault it was a new hole so you fix it come back on so you see a snake no i never seen no snake so it just crawled off and went away from wow god got rid of it and i can i the last couple weeks or two three weeks yeah i injured my hand i don't know if you remember about the machine got my hand and it was just a big red ball and i i couldn't clap my hands because it hurt so much this morning and i clapped and i was praise the lord the lord it's wonderful to have my hands be able to praise the lord god's good praise the lord jesus amen the lady my wife uh takes around she had tested pasta for kobet uh this week and sonia was willing thursday and um but she said but i feel fine i said well just go to the store get a test because she was concerned about you all and being here um because she's perfectly fine i said just go get a test 48 hours uh you know after she met with her of course they both wear masks when they're together but i said just give a test and since she ran against fast she's negative so so kind of figured that anyway but thank god appreciate the lord's protection and keeping her amen so god is good isn't he amen let's stand to our feet if we could turning the scripture to isaiah chapter one and we're going to begin our scripture reading in isaiah chapter 1 verse 18. praise the lord so thankful of god being mindful of us so good to us amen thank you jesus isaiah chapter one read a couple of verses of scripture here starting with the 18th verse amen a thought that came on my heart we'd spoke on this before but uh something it came on my heart that i wanted to bring again a situation that happened so anyway the lord put this on my heart so trust to be a blessing to you let's bow our heads now before we read the word of god lord jesus we're very thankful lord of your blessings and love to us thank you for this time of fellowship for bringing us here lord to for this place you provided for us father lord thank you for all the goodness that you've given us and all that you've done for us and the blessings you've shined upon our life keeping us healthy and strong and blessing and healing lord and all that you do god every day we thank you lord for your word lord and for the spirit and the revelation of that word that comes upon our hearts that we can see and know and you being revealed to us lord how that means so much to us god because many people can't get that don't don't grasp that it's not revealed to them it's not for everybody to know according to your word the lord thank you for shining your light upon our pathway and allowing us one more time lord to assemble together and to hear of your word and to learn of your word and expecting you god to meet with us and doing this seemingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think we thank you lord for uh the the revelation for opening it to us lord and shining your light upon our pathway one more time lord we pray you bless each one that has come lord help those who weren't able to make it for whatever reason move upon the prayer for the prayer requests that we're made known in every circumstance and situation you master every circumstance lord our faith masters every circumstance and believing god that you're going to make everything well and you what you make all things work together for our good we thank you for it lord today and we commit ourselves to you and pray you bless the reading of your word now as we committed to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen isaiah chapter 1 verse 18 it says come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be a scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient you shall eat of the good of the lamb but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord has spoken in you could be seated if you like pray the lord would add his blessings to the reading of this word here amen also i failed to mention it just came to my mind there a failed dimension i could do it at the end of service but i just didn't want it to slip my mind lord willing next saturday we're going to be baptizing shariah's brother sister shelia's grandstep son uh i don't think they consider him steps so you don't consider him your step brother do you technically is but he's her brother so and and he's her grandson so but javi uh text me while i was or actually messaged me while i was gone out of town in florida and asked if i baptized him i said absolutely absolutely so be my honor so next saturday at the zincos pool at 3 30 we're gonna baptize hobby so i haven't gotten a hold of the frajos yet i thought maybe marcos might be able to come and baptize marcos too but i kind of got excited about hobby wanting to be baptized and was very honored that he asked me so if you want to if you uh is something that's on your heart next saturday if not pray for us 3 30 on the in the afternoon next saturday uh we'll be baptizing brother javi so javier is it this upcoming saturday yeah the sixth yeah okay so it is the sixth i didn't look up the date i know tomorrow's the first uh so yeah i guess that would be the sixth so saturday the 6th at 3 30. so if you can come be there welcome to come not please pray for us but uh kind of excited about that thankful the lord put it on his heart for one to be baptized yes so amen kind of almost goes to the service here amen we want to talk this morning about someone who is uh that the lord has who's uh willing to allow him to use them people someone anyone who is willing to relinquish their rights their thoughts everything about themselves to the lord jesus that he may use them because that's who god's looking for god's looking for someone who is not only able to do something but willing to do something and if you look at this the scripture says here in isaiah if ye be willing and obedient amen willing and obedient ye shall eat of the good of that lamb but if you refuse and rebel which of course is the just the opposite of of willing and obedient if you refuse and rebel you should shall be devoured with the sword we know the sword is the word for the mouth of the lord has spoken it and if you go and look at several places in the scripture we find out that the sword that comes forth is out of the mouth of god is the word of god the sword is the word is a sharp powerful sword that sword will devour the enemy those who are unwilling to relinquish themselves to the lord unwilling to allow god to use them unwilling for god to move them and shape them and and whatever his desire and perfect will for any of us is and i trust and believe that we we in ourselves want the lord's perfect will in our lives and are willing to allow god to move us in the capacity that he would so that we he could accomplish through us what what that perfect will is we are the ones that god uses we are the subjects that god uses uh to accomplish whatever he wants done in this world today and he's looking for people who want to do it not obligated not that you have to do it he wants people that want to do it people that are willing to do it people that have a desire of god whatever it is and wherever it is lord send me i mean that's with isaiah's cry there uh in isaiah he said you know when when the coal of fire touched the prophet he said lord send me what can i do what how can i uh be of service to you what how can you use me to accomplish what you want done lord you send me whatever it is send me uh you look in the scripture many places people of god like that just like mary uh when the angel come to marion where she had a couple of questions to him and but the angel of the lord finally said you were the chosen one and she said be it unto me according to your will she was willing to take her approach she was willing to take the suffering she was willing to go through everything the ridicule she had to go through now today if it were to happen today there's probably not a lot of ridicule that goes on because it probably happens all the time but back at that time there was a huge ridicule you were ostracized you were stoned you were put out if you were unmarried and found with child so for her to say that was a big deal it meant something for her to say i am willing to do whatever you want me to do be it unto me according to your will and that should be this subject that should be the the anthem the theme of every one of us every christian be it unto me according to your will and she was willing to do it regardless of what it cost her regardless of what it took even joseph was going to put her away and mind if he put her away privately until an angel came to him and says no no no you take you take her she's your wife you take her to yourself what's in her is of the holy ghost he'll come forth the son of god you'll call his name jesus amen and he did just that but if it weren't for god he was still even willing to to take the reproach whatever it costs now god is always he's always looking for someone who is willing always in fact god may choose somebody uh a lot of times you hear criticisms of of people saying things about somebody doing something for the lord remember the disciples even came to jesus one time and said jesus this man is out here praying he doesn't know anything about you jesus said leave him alone he said if he's not against us he's for us amen so if he's for us and uh leave him alone let him do what he's doing because he's if he's doing the work of the lord let him alone if he's going out and praying for people and people are being healed and things are being done leave him alone see but there's always seems like there's always people who want to be critical of others and say well he shouldn't be doing that or she shouldn't be over there or she shouldn't mirror he shouldn't and always critical but you know god god may allow someone to do so god may call somebody to do something that uh that maybe they're not as qualified as somebody else to do but they're willing to do it the person who may be the utmost qualified the person who may be in the best position to do it the person who may know the most about it and have the most gift in this capacity are but they're unwilling to do what god wants them to do well god's not going to use somebody he doesn't care how trained they are or how able they are to do so how much knowledge they have he wants somebody willing he wants somebody that is willing to allow god to move upon that person to do whatever it is he called them to do because if that person is winged every other obstacle can be overcome if a person's willing if a person is willing to learn if a person is willing to submit themselves if a person is willing to relinquish their rights and their abilities their thoughts into the hands of the master god can absolutely annihilate any other obstacle anything else he can teach he can bring along a willing subject is a teachable subject it's somebody that god can teach that god can show that god can use yes god can't use somebody who's they may be fully qualified but they just don't want to do it they're just unwilling to do it god well you know i'm fully capable lord i'm probably more capable anybody but i don't want to go there i don't want to go over there i don't want to do that i don't want to be put in that situation i don't want to be found ridiculed god's looking for somebody willing amen i remember when we went to florida when i moved to florida friend the ridicule i got the people that came against me the things that were said about me my life was threatened a lot of people may not know that and i probably may have never said that out loud and i'm not really sure why i said it just then uh but it came out and it's the truth i mean i had a a an elder minister pastor this message says there are men in their graves today that tried to come against this work i mean i consider that a threat it was and and i was probably the least qualified i was probably the least able i was probably the least one in that situation but when god said go i was willing to go hallelujah when god wanted something to be done and i was willing to do it god sent me to go do it it wasn't easy but god always took care god always blessed you because you asked my wife i laid the bed for two or three days because i was so depressed i couldn't even get out it's the only time i've ever been in a situation like that i've never been in that situation but i had it had just come down so hard and so heavy on me i just couldn't handle it anymore she knelt by my bed and prayed for me because it just i just couldn't do it but after those prayers and the strength of the lord god i believe accomplished whatever he sent me there to do and when that was done god sent me back here to tucson to be with brother greene i pray and assume that whatever that was and whatever the lord's doing we just want to be willing to do it whether we are the top-notch able or in the position god can god can completely obliterate all other obstacles if you're willing to do it but he just wants somebody who's willing to do it and that flies in the face of so much of the world's spirit anymore because the world spirit is or somebody else will do it oh somebody else will take care of it i mean if you don't believe that go our beautiful tucson city you go walk and look around the city go down the interstates and walk in and see just the filth and the trash and stuff everywhere i was driving down the street going back uh uh the other day in florida and there's this young couple man and woman there and she had this walmart bag in her hand and she was flinging it up and i didn't know what the world they were doing they were in a convertible and she just threw the bag out just to go out in the middle of well somebody else will pick it up it's not my problem anymore it's a spirit and it's a prevalent spirit today because you see it everywhere they're not concerned with those things somebody else will do it somebody it's somebody else's problem i don't have to deal with it anymore it's sad but that falls in the face flies in the face of the spirit of god who's looking for someone who's willing to do it someone who wants to do it don't let it become somebody else's issue don't let it become somebody else's problem if the lord leads you to do something if the lord speaks to you to do something if god's calling you he's just looking for someone who's willing to say okay lord i'll do it i'll go i'll i'll be put in that situation i'll be put lord just whatever it is i know you'll take care of me i know you'll bless it whatever it is look at first chronicles let's go over to the 28th verse first chronicles 28. amen first chronicles chapter 28 verse 9. look at the exhortation given to solomon here first chronicles 28 9 and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind don't close yourself down don't shut yourself down to say well i'll never do that i'll never go there or i'll i'll never speak to this person all right you know and a lot of times if you really are willing god will call you to do something you really don't want to do i mean look at jonah god called jonah now jonah was willing you think jonah wasn't willing that's why he went to tarshish he wasn't willing but but if you if you boil down to the man's heart i believe he was willing because that's how that's why he ended up doing it anyway but he wanted somebody that was willing and god called this man for that purpose god called him for that purpose and he tried to run but of course when god arrested he was like yeah okay god i'll i'll go at that word whatever you want me to do i'll do it and he was the perfect person for the perfect place all that happened for the for the fulfillment of god's will in his life so that it would happen a willing mind he had a willing mind a lot of times god will call you to do something you don't want to do he may send you to a place you don't want to go he'll have you living somewhere you don't want to live but if he wants you to do it if it's his will for some reason he's just want somebody who's willing to do it amen if you're willing to do it now sometimes it's the hard stuff that makes the that's the hardest part too amen god that god doesn't just god doesn't just have jobs that are just nice little easy flowery jobs so a lot of the things that god assigns us to do are hard things they're things that great against our flesh there are things we don't want to do there are things that come against what we would desire but but he wants the person that's with a willing mind that is that wants to do it amen whether you're able to do it or not let god take care of the able part amen he'll take care of the abel park if you're just willing to do it a perfect heart with a willing mind for the lord searches all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee all forever willy have a willing mind god just needs somebody to work through that has a willing mind that's able to do it now look at this uh i've probably read this quote before i think it's a very fairly powerful quote but and he says it more places than one but look at this from that time spokane washington 1962 he says god only wants one man and i will say one woman amen one man one person god wants one man that he can fully get in his complete control that's right one man that'll fully surrender to him just like he did moses just like he's talked about moses he was talking about moses i'm going down there to take over what a ridiculous thing an army like in those days he had the whole world conquered a bigger army than it would be today than to meet like to meet russia he had an old crooked stick in his hand talking about moses uh the stick the power of god he's going whiskers blowing back and forth 80 years old why didn't he do it when he was a young warrior see god had to knock all that intellectual out of him he had to take him on the backside of the desert mash him down crash him down and bring him back and appear him and appear to him and show him what he was to do one person one man if he could get that one person if god that one person in his complete control understand now complete control total dying out to ourselves complete control he said he would but the man said god could turn this world upside down one person in his complete control why could you just imagine but you want to be that one person makes you wonder lord what is what would it take to be that one person what would it take to be that one that's willing you know they had this this gambling lottery stuff here this week with all the billions of dollars that was out of for people to to gamble on and and to try to become rich overnight you got one point something billion i forgot what it was a mind-boggling amount of money an amount of money that would be a struggle for anybody to spend in a lifetime but these people are going crazy buying tickets everywhere by the hundreds by the thousands trying to win this this little bit of money i thought my if if people could get so sold out to christ like they were to try to win this little bit of money that's going to rust and grow tomorrow what would this world be like what would this country be like if the people if they took every dollar they put into that and put it towards christ what would it be and they worry about all the other things going and they said well we need to fix that we need to fix this and yet they got people sold out to that willing to sell themselves out to that thing just to win a little bit of money why it just made me think what a what a crazy thing it is to be willing someone willing to do it moses oh he had objections sure moses had objections but he was willing to do it jonah had objections but he was willing to do it mary had objections but she was willing to do it jeremiah had objections but he was willing elijah had tons of of objections but he was willing to do it brother branham had objections do you know that you know his life story i'm sure most of you do you know his life story he had plenty of objections but he was willing to do it amen now it cost him some things like his wife his baby to mold him into that position just like brother graham talked about moses he had to crush him and smush him and crash him out well jesus went through the same thing so he he didn't expect anything of us if he didn't do himself amen but he was willing to do it amen willing to do it that's the main thing he was willing to do it james let's go over to james chapter one james chapter 1. now the whole point of this now this morning is to help us understand are are we so in love with christ so in love with him that we're willing to do whatever he asks of us whatever he wants us to do in life whatever he calls for us to do whether it's moving around the world or maybe it's something simple as going and talking to someone that you really don't want to talk to sitting down next to somebody who is somebody you really don't want to associate with or be seen with or you never know i mean i'll just be honest with you i i don't i don't entirely know why the lord has me on this job but i think about it a lot and i think maybe that one of my chris somebody i'm supposed to witness to and then you hear somebody that says oh i go to a non-denomination church and i love it you think oh maybe that's the guy and then you steer clear of the the other older curmudgeon guy uh surely it's not him but you don't know amen because that was my attitude i didn't actively think that but that was my attitude i kind of you know and then the lord reminded me it could be this amen lord so the question then to me was are you willing to do it are you willing to sit down with him are you willing to talk to him are you willing to open a conversation are you willing to engage him to the point that there will be a conversation about me amen that's you gotta you you gotta die to yourself at that point and say lord i i'm willing to do it whatever it is lord you just help me you just show me and then somebody that uh you know that uh that you wouldn't typically normally go to a friendly open conversation kind of thing you can stand there and ask a question you know like he basically ignored you didn't hear and and my wife said maybe he didn't i know he did but it's just that kind of guy it's not it's not personal but that's just the way it is you think you know why talk but there's a reason there's always a reason we just got to find what that reason is and be willing to do it whatever it is amen may not be easy but if god sent you to do something he's going to be with you amen james chapter 1 uh verse 22 be doers of the word not just hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is likened to a man but holding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself in other words he's it's just a facade and that's all it is it's a reflection of facade there's nothing real to it you're just looking at a mirror you see to look in the mirror in the face for he beholdeth himself and he goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgivable hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed blessed in his deed amen so a person that is willing to do not just here which it seems like a lot of christianity has come to go to church and do my penance or whatever it is that they consider that that makes them a christian and they and they then they become basically hearers and not doers of the word they're not here in their in their human capacity to fulfill the word of god which is whatever the purpose of god is in your life that's the fulfilling of the word of god it's just being here it's just doing all i'll just do this and i'll just do that or and or i'll just come to church i'll sit there i'll be faithful and but but if serving god is outside of this room amen serving god takes us outside of this room and puts us in life that makes us doers that makes us fulfill the word of god to live the word of god not just let the word live through you but live the word amen let that word be who you are so that it is living through you amen i know sometimes in the scripture says that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak but sometimes we just got to overcome the flesh get past the flesh stronger than the flesh amen that takes prayer and fasting amen fasting will help you overcome your flesh quicker and better than anything that i know of personally and i just tell you that from practical experience in my own life and then people sometimes even my wife looks i don't know how you can go so long without eating i conditioned my body i told my body you're not going to have food until i tell you that's right and my body learned that it didn't have to have so much food at such a certain time and it's trained to say and some people say well that's why you stay so skinny though that's not the point of it the point is not to not eat the point is to obey the lord the point is to allow even your flesh to be subject to christ in his word and the movement of the spirit when you've got your flesh obeying everything else including food when you got your flesh obeying everything else then how does it obey god no god has to be first amen god has to be first god is first in your life before food or water amen yes amen could not god created this could he not do with his he will amen i mean he's brought friend god has brought water to a man out of the dried up jawbone of a of an ass well if he can do that then can't he give you whatever you need right oh my praise the lord he's give a prophets in the bible cakes for angels yes he he's he's fed men in the bible uh food from animals that would bring them food god can do anything he wants he can drive up or he can bring it forth whatever your desire is but it comes a time where our lives have to obey that word amen and be willing to allow god to to use it in a way that in in the things that we are to do come by prayer and fasting prayer talking to the lord and fasting not praying fast but prayer and fasting amen you probably all know this is just a commitment i made many many years ago to the lord i never eat on sunday morning whether i'm preaching or not whether i'm going to church or not which i we may one sunday a year maybe we're not in church uh but that's extremely rare i i don't i don't that's my commitment to the lord everybody's different you can do what you want but it's an important part of your life it's an important part of your spiritual life let's put it that way amen now let's go over to a couple more scriptures i've got we'll close here in a minute first peter chapter 5 first peter chapter 5 while you're turning there i'll just read this to you another quote of god acts of the holy of the holy spirit 1954 uh when a man's ever born truly listen to this now this this this transcends a confession this transcends a repentance this transcends a baptism this is a person truly born born again of the spirit of god okay so now that that groundwork has been laid truly born of the spirit of god and from the crown of his head to the ends of his toenails he's been changed by the resurrection power of the lord jesus christ and his own selfish ideas have faded away god has got complete control of that man person individual humanity amen god has got complete control at that point relinquished from the crown of his head to the point of his toenails god has got complete control over that man he will believe every written word of the lord jesus christ and practice practice not just years but doers of the word practice that word put that word to life let that word walk in shoe leather again today through you amen not just words but deeds the word of christ practice that the same the word of christ upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it amen that would make you feel uh that would make you feel religious wouldn't this is the stone that was said at night of you builders neither is there salvation in any other name than the name of the lord jesus and the bible said here that they those disciples they perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned but there was one thing they did have they might have been ignorant they might have been unlearned but there was one thing that those disciples that god chose had one thing in common every one of them when he called was willing to follow him they were willing to go that's the one thing they had may have been ignored and unlearned they may not know nothing outside of fishing but they were willing they were willing to leave father mother they were willing to whatever it cost them they were willing to do it that's the one thing they had you might not have had an education they might not have had degrees plastered their wall they might have had a doctor of divinity of any kind but they were willing to go and look what god did through their lives they didn't have they didn't go to seminaries they didn't have any great degrees of taught by uh uh theologians the scripture they were they just followed with christ they learned the lessons from him they got filled with the holy spirit and they wrote a book of acts praise the lord simply because they were willing they were willing willing subjects willing for god to use them praise the lord first peter now chapter five verse one and two the elders which are among you i exhort whom i'm also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint i think we read this scripture here a few weeks ago we're talking about willing amen feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucr but for a ready mind be willing not by constraint in other words again god is not looking for someone who he has to force to do something he's not looking for someone he's having to make do it he wants someone who is willing to do it with a willing heart with a willing mind that's the person that god's looking for are you willing to do it if you're willing to do it that doesn't mean god's going to call you to do it but if you're willing to do it he's got someone he can use he's got someone he can mold he can shape he can do something with he can get something accomplished it's hard to get some it's hard to get just think of this naturally if you're going on like sort of like a like with brother roger or a job i'm doing now or something like that or just an office worker or or whatever if you're going to a job and and you walk in and you say and and the job calls for you to do this this and this and you're like well i'm not going to do that i'm going to do this this and this well you're no good to those people they want you to do it the way they tell you to do it they want you to do it according to whatever their blueprint or whatever their uh uh order procedure is they want you to do it like that and so many people today god might call a person that they want to do things their own way god's not looking for somebody who wants to do their own way he's looking for somebody who wants to do it his way and to do that you have to die to yourself right you have to die to your thoughts you have to die of your opinions you have to die to your knowledge you have to die that that's like brother branham talked about it he said i i i have i have no gift but one gift and that's to yield myself to him amen you watch videos and listen to tapes and he stands up and says i take control over authority over every spirit in here in the name of jesus christ for the glory of god right brother branham has no authority to speak like that but the god that was speaking through him does the person that was willing to stand there as a subject of jesus christ and speak the authority of god right there and i guarantee you every demon in that place was shaken in their boots they had to obey that voice because they saw something other than just a man a little five foot nine bald man standing there and saying well i think i'll just say this no no no he said it because he was willing and god backed him up and spoke through him those words and when that authority came through those demons had to go they had to obey and they did amen they did praise the lord one more scripture i'll read to you here ii corinthians chapter 8. second corinthians chapter eight i'll turn here we'll close in just a minute you must have faith in what you're doing if you don't have faith in what you're doing and then you're not going to do a good job you're not going to be able to fulfill that purpose correctly appropriately unless you have faith in what you're doing i i know i've you know when somebody has their own thought or idea of something um in the natural maybe you do have a better way of doing something um it just came to my mind this this past week uh stuff was there was a lot of stuff done wrong there was a lot of stuff that wasn't done uh done at all and we had to go in and fix everything and then do all the other stuff that needed to be done and nobody had made provision for this horn outside to to go off there was no power to it the thing was just sitting on the wall and nobody no other group no none of the other crews come in and made provision to get power to that thing and that and it has to go off if you've ever gone into mr carwash and makes this big loud horn sound has to be wired up so then it has to be uh it has to be fixed to where it can work and work properly there's got to be power go to it or it's not going to work so he figured out a way to get it from this box go up the wall go around this way go out the hole and go into the thing so the head of the crew came to me and says i got a project for you i want you to do this i said okay and the guy that had been electrician for years and been on that job for years and or a while anyway i don't know if it's years but the older fellow he came and said well we do this this this and this i said no i said you know why do you want to do all this just cut that right there and pull this over here and then attach it well what do you do here and here and that's it don't worry about it he just told me to do it so i did it and fixed it and worked it during something i've done roger showed me the trick years ago of how you can do something and fix it right so there is in the natural uh sometimes better ideas the ways of doing things and but with god his idea is perfect his idea is right his idea cannot fail and we subject ourselves to that idea if we come to god with that same attitude that i came to him and he was kind of mad at me for that but i i mean what could i do i wasn't i wasn't going to do it his way that was going to create such a problem and i just wasn't going to do it like that but if we do that with god it doesn't we can't it doesn't work because there is no better way there is no better idea than what his is so when he has to do something we just say yes yes lord yes i'll do that amen i'll do it but you've got to have faith in what you're doing see if i had done it the way that man had told me if i didn't know better from working with brother roger i hadn't just done it this way i but if i had tried to do that knowing there was a better way of doing it i would have not had faith in doing it that way i'd have probably messed everything up because i would had no faith in doing it like that because i knew there's a better way of doing it but when you know what god shows you to do there's not a better way of doing it than what god has told you to do you can have faith in it and believe that it's gonna work out exactly perfect the way it's supposed to because it's his way not my way his way amen you gotta you must have faith in what you're doing praise the lord now uh i just turned second corinthians chapter eight verse one it says moreover brother we do you to the wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joys and their deep poverty abounded in unto the riches of their liberality liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power that they were willing of themselves willing of themselves you know praying us uh with much entreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god because they were willing see that instruments that we desire titus that has he begun so he would also finish in the same uh in you the same grace also therefore as ye abound in everything in faith and utterance knowledge and in all diligence in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of their love for ye know the grace of your lord jesus christ that through that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye might that ye through his poverty might be rich amen herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who had begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago now therefore perform the doing of it and as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have for if uh if there be a willing mind it is accepted according to that man hath and not according to he hath none for i mean not but that other men be erased and ye burdened or eased and ye burned but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their one that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that had gathered much have nothing over he that had gathered little has no lack but it doesn't work unless you have people that are willing they have to desire and be willing to allow themselves to become one together and we become one together as we become one with him and this works in the mind of god in the operation of god as we come together as one in him and we see each other that way and then god's entire family is taken care of his entire family all of us everybody's taken care of god's give different gifts to different people he's give different uh abilities to different people and some have more than others some have abundance some have very little but when god allows to move upon our hearts has god ever moved you to to just give something to somebody just for no reason you don't even know why maybe a hundred dollar bill or uh take them something they might need or uh some food or something i know i've heard stories have had the lord move on me before but i've heard stories too that that people are just out of food and somebody come and say the lord just told me to to bring you this food well thank you because we had nothing but he had to find somebody willing to do it right somebody willing to take food off their own table and give it to somebody else take a little money out of their pocket and give it to somebody else god's just looking for the person that's willing that's what this whole system was about and how it was supposed to work you saw the days of ananias and sapphira i mean and he held back a portion of what they had sold oh we we're selling all this out and but you know we got to keep a little bit of it back well that was so displeasing but the holy ghost when they came and lied to the spirit of god through peter the man dropped dead then the woman dropped dead amen god's trying to find somebody who is willing to want to do it have the faith in doing it that's my point and i said fire did not have the faith in doing what this was that was called of them to do and because they didn't have the faith in it to do it they didn't do it they secretly or they tried to secretly you don't have people trying to secretly do stuff knowing that you can do nothing secretly with god right you do know that right you can't do anything in secret you know well i can say this or i can lie about that or i can do you can't do anything that god doesn't know so you know there's nothing in secret so they're secretly trying to hold back that just shows a lack of faith right there but they didn't have faith in the system they tried to subvert the system and hold some back and they were accountable to god for it came before peter the man dropped dead they wound him up took him out his wife came in and she conspired the same thing and the same ones that took her out and took him out took her out amen unwilling to do it this quote god's only provided place of worship listen now because this is where this is what it comes down to because we know before this quote we know that the scriptures in corinthians gives us all the gifts of the spirit and of all the gifts of the spirit everybody seems to enjoy the prophecy or the speaking in tongues or the things that's kind of the outward things that everybody sees and marvels at and acknowledges oh what great gifts and the miracles and the healings and and those things even like in brother branham's ministry how many times you hear the majoring of those things and the healings and the miracles and a lot of the things that brother branham did for people that went under the radar that a lot of people never heard of or knew about just helping just being there just giving a little something there's a gift there there is a gift of the spirit that a lot of people forget first corinthians 12 that's a gift of helps yes i don't i i would say there's probably a large amount of people in christian life that don't even know that right that don't even know there's a gift of helps of just being a help just being there for people just being given a bed to sleep in give him a meal give him a ride give him a few bucks whatever it is help just be there to help somebody just be there to help people amen a lot of people forget that i believe brother branham had that very uh abundantly but you always hear about all the other stuff and the things of just the helps of the things that we're doing you hardly ever hear anything about those things but it's just as important yes it's just as important to god the gift the gifts of helps is just as important as the gift of healing or the gifted discernment or the gift of prophecy or whatever the gift of helps is just as important look now this is the placing of it as i close here only god's only provided place of worship he said it's your love to god amen it's your love to god praise the lord what is our love to the lord how much do we love him do we love him where is our love it's our love to god he said lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it he said then you're getting somewhere it's your love to god lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it he said then you're getting somewhere when you're willing to do it but it's your love to god how much do you love love equals obedience love will bring in obedience because that love will be shared to to be so strong that will cause you to compel you to want to do even if it's something you don't want to do even if it seems like something that doesn't make sense to you if it's god leaving if it's god's doing then god's going to bring it through and he's gonna use you to do it if you're willing to do that then god's god's got somebody he can use and that's all he's looking for amen somebody he can use praise the lord let's stand if we could amen how many of us are willing to say lord be it unto me amen according to your will lord be it unto me i'm willing to do it whatever it is whatever you call of me wherever you send me i'm willing to do it amen be willing and obedient we should eat of the good fruit of the land if we're willing and obedient shall eat of the good fruit of the land amen praise the lord listen us this course we all know it but i was going to try to find it here amen i think we all know it anyway are you willing to lead a holy life amen amen that's exactly right 534 he is lord praise the lord jesus amen [Music] something a lot of people are willing to do amen holy life not uh we're not talking about being forced to do something you desire to do something he has risen from the dead amen [Music] is jesus christ [Music] he has

rather than the high 90s and 95 humidity like this week you know you're sweating a lot when you drink three or four gallons of water in a day and you don't have to go to the bathroom it all comes out the pores consume a lot of water and other stuff too uh electrolytes things like that but consume a lot of liquid um but god keeps us blesses us you know people people pay thousands i was thinking of
