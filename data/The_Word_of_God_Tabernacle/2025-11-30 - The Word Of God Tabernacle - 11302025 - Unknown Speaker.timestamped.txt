[1:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching over us and
[1:12] keeping us Lord and through this
[1:14] beautiful Thanksgiving week that we were
[1:16] able to be a part of Lord. We're so
[1:18] thankful to you, God, that this country
[1:20] many years ago, Lord, decided, a
[1:23] wonderful, great man of God, a
[1:25] president, Abraham Lincoln, decided to
[1:28] make this a a national holiday of of
[1:30] thanksgiving, Lord. And he of all
[1:33] presidents would know what it would mean
[1:35] to give thanks to you, God. Yes.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful, God, that Lord,
[1:39] you've blessed us to be able to
[1:41] recognize that every day to us is a
[1:43] thanksgiving. And we're so very thankful
[1:46] for all that you do for us, all that
[1:47] you've given to us, where you lead us,
[1:50] where you bless us. God, we're just uh
[1:52] we're just so thankful, Father, for we
[1:54] are truly a blessed people.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for this place, this
[1:58] time, Lord, and for this beautiful day
[2:00] that you've given us once again to come
[2:02] in from out of the world and expect you
[2:04] to meet with us once again in this
[2:06] place. May you move in a supernatural
[2:09] way once again here as we commit
[2:11] ourselves to you and ask your blessings
[2:13] Lord on this service for those who may
[2:15] be here, those who may be coming, those
[2:17] who may be streaming. Lord, just bless
[2:19] each one of us as we commit ourselves in
[2:21] your hands. We rebuke every demonic
[2:24] spirit that would try to hurt, hinder,
[2:26] infiltrate this service in any way that
[2:28] you would get the glory, honor, and
[2:30] praise for all that is done said and
[2:32] done here in this place today. We ask it
[2:34] and pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:36] Christ. Amen.

[14:42] &gt;&gt; It's more than life to us. Hallelujah.
[14:45] Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; A lot of people try to make Jesus a part
[14:47] of their lifestyle. You notice in the
[14:50] world today, as we've said several
[14:51] times, seems to be a surge of people
[14:54] that are wanting to come and wanting to
[14:57] receive and wanting to get and become a
[15:00] part of that. Amen. But you know, re uh
[15:03] Matthew 25 tells us that they would.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. They would come after that oil.
[15:08] They would come after that. But
[15:10] &gt;&gt; a lot of people want to make Jesus a
[15:12] part of their life. Amen.
[15:15] That's I guess that's all well and good,
[15:17] but to me, if G Jesus is my life,
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus isn't a part of my life. He
[15:22] [clears throat] is my life. Amen.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; He is life. Period. Amen. Not a part of
[15:27] my life. Amen. I don't want to make him
[15:29] a part of my life. He is my life.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Without him, everything
[15:35] is nothing.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. So, we
[15:39] don't want to make him a part of our
[15:40] lives. We want to make him our life.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Everything that we are, every breath we
[15:46] take, every time we blink our eyes,
[15:49] every time our heart beats, Amen. It is
[15:52] God.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is God. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't look to see it. Amen. I
[15:59] don't see any prayer requests over
[16:00] there. I got a couple prayer requests to
[16:02] bring your attention here today. Amen.
[16:07] Uh got a text earlier uh this morning
[16:12] from brother Danny.
[16:14] He said he had his work some work done
[16:17] to his foot uh this week and he's uh in
[16:20] a lot of pain or in in some pain. So he
[16:23] thought he would stay off of it. Stay
[16:24] home today streaming. So if you're
[16:26] streaming, God bless you, brother Danny.
[16:28] I know that when Danny usually when
[16:29] Danny's not here, he is streaming. So
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um he is faithful for that. So,
[16:35] God bless you, brother, if you're
[16:37] watching today. So, please remember him
[16:39] in prayer. He put this word down that
[16:40] they did to his foot. I have no idea
[16:42] what it is. So, uh there's no sense of
[16:44] me trying to act like a doctor. So, he
[16:46] just had some work done to his foot.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[16:50] &gt;&gt; They trimmed the dead skin.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. I didn't really need to hear that,
[16:54] [laughter]
[16:55] honestly. At least we're not at lunch.
[16:59] He had some work done to his foot, so
[17:02] he's in some pain. Uh so please remember
[17:05] him in prayer. Uh sitting off his foot
[17:07] today. So thankful brother Dennis is
[17:09] with us. Amen. Is your foot getting
[17:11] better, brother?
[17:12] &gt;&gt; It's getting better.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Last time we had
[17:14] lunch together, he said it was getting
[17:16] better. So it's getting better. We had
[17:18] prayer here. Amen. And so thankful that
[17:20] uh uh brother Dennis is getting better
[17:23] as well. Also got a text from Sister
[17:24] Julie. Um, uh, I don't know how much of
[17:28] her text she would like for me to bring
[17:30] to your attention today, but, uh, she
[17:32] didn't sleep well last night. She's
[17:34] extremely nauseated this morning. She
[17:36] was still going to try to come if she
[17:37] could. The nausea left her, uh, but
[17:40] she's just, uh, having, well, I just say
[17:42] it. I mean, we're all adults. Well,
[17:44] except for Gabriel and Alice, but, um,
[17:47] uh, she's having some very severe
[17:50] menopausal symptoms. So, just please
[17:53] remember her in prayer. uh the Lord
[17:55] would just help her, touch her, get her
[17:56] through that, take it from her. Uh
[17:59] whatever the situation is, she said she
[18:01] misses us so very much and she wants to
[18:03] be back in church. Uh it just seems like
[18:06] one thing just one attack after the
[18:08] other. Amen. So any of you have
[18:11] experienced it or been through it or
[18:13] been a part of someone who's been
[18:14] through it, um uh please you can
[18:18] obviously enter into prayer for Sister
[18:20] Julie in that situation. So please
[18:21] remember her. Amen. remember of of
[18:25] course the Pats with us again today and

[18:37] I'm assuming hopefully in another month
[18:40] or so will be with us so remember them
[18:42] in prayer as well we're thankful that
[18:44] the Lord Jesus is with us amen and
[18:47] that's all we need praise the Lord amen

[19:05] mean, she is really thin now. And, um,
[19:10] uh, Leah, who's a nurse, um, told her
[19:13] there's something just not right. Well,

[19:18] you sent in for check your colon and,
[19:22] you know,
[19:23] Colag guard
[19:25] &gt;&gt; and they found some blood
[19:28] &gt;&gt; and she's very concerned.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Well, because of what I went through,
[19:34] &gt;&gt; that's exactly what what they found out
[19:36] about myself.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; She has to have a colonoscopy.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; And we're praying that all will be well.
[19:43] There's it's not all only cancer, you
[19:46] know, of
[19:49] there's olives, there's there's
[19:52] different So, we're praying that all
[19:54] would go well. Glory to
[19:55] &gt;&gt; God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yes. Let's
[19:57] remember. I was going to ask you if it
[19:59] was if she was on the dietary reason she
[20:01] lose weight, but apparently not. So,
[20:03] remember brother Dennis sister in prayer
[20:06] if you would. Sister
[20:11] &gt;&gt; did.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. precious brother Paul. Love our
[20:23] brother, sister Margaret very much. Miss
[20:26] him so much. But please remember,
[20:28] brother Paul, he's had this dealing and
[20:29] this battle with this cancer for a
[20:31] little while now.
[20:33] He's kind of been up and down. His
[20:35] numbers go down and they go back up. And
[20:37] as you heard Sister Sheilia say, uh his
[20:41] numbers uh went back up. So he's
[20:45] starting chemotherapy again.
[20:47] Is he doing radiation too or just chemo?
[20:50] You know,
[20:52] probably just chemo more than likely in
[20:54] this circumstance. Yeah. So, so please
[20:57] remember brother Paul in prayer as well.
[21:04] Have an unspoken request on your heart.
[21:08] He knows our hearts. Amen. So, very

[21:15] Thankful the Lord Jesus mindful of us.
[21:17] Amen.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As brother Dennis, if
[21:20] you take these things to the Lord for
[21:21] us.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, it's an honor
[21:25] once again to be in your house. Yes.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; House of worship, a house of prayer.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I totally in agreement with what
[21:34] the pastor just said.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Being a servant of yours, it's not a
[21:39] lifestyle. It's not a a club that we've
[21:44] joined or a popularity that's amongst
[21:47] the people.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; It's your life, Father, living in us. It
[21:52] gives us the hope of
[21:55] &gt;&gt; salvation, the hope of eternity.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; You know, I heard your prophet say
[22:01] earlier this week, you're not even saved
[22:04] until you're born again.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's why you see a lot of
[22:08] so-called Christians saying, "I love
[22:11] God." And they're doing things of the
[22:14] world. They're praying in titles.
[22:17] They're living in sin. They're living in
[22:20] adultery. They're living in fornication.
[22:24] And they believe within their heart,
[22:28] they're religious. They're going to make
[22:30] it. AND YOUR PROPHET TAUGHT THE GREATEST
[22:33] DECEPTION in this world. is a religious
[22:37] deception where PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH
[22:39] RELIGION LIKE THE PROPHET SAID JUST TO
[22:42] MAKE THEMSELVES MISERABLE. IT'S TIME TO
[22:45] REPENT AND GET RIGHT WITH GOD. LORD, I I
[22:50] read this morning how you told us to
[22:53] pray and that we may not enter into
[22:56] temptation.
[22:58] To pray, Father, that we can grow deeper
[23:03] in your love. Yes, Jesus.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; To pray, Father, that we will not miss
[23:09] YOUR COMING BECAUSE YOU'LL COME as a
[23:12] thief in the night.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; JESUS,
[23:14] &gt;&gt; YOUR PROPHET EVEN TAUGHT US, FATHER, HOW
[23:16] DO you grow deeper in the love of God?
[23:19] He said, real simple,
[23:22] &gt;&gt; pray and read your Bible.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; And Lord, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING on
[23:27] even amongst the followers of this
[23:30] message.
[23:31] They lacked the ability that that simple
[23:37] um
[23:38] SITUATION IN THEIR LIFE where they're
[23:41] born again for when it comes to lining
[23:45] up to your word. If you're truly LIVING
[23:48] IN US, IT'S AUTOMATIC.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S AUTOMATIC. IT'S A PROPHECY OF HIS
[23:54] CHRIST is truly IN OUR HEART. WE CAN'T
[23:57] wait for those church doors to OPEN UP.
[24:00] IT'S AUTOMATIC TO give you the 10% in
[24:03] offerings. IT'S AUTOMATIC TO PRAY. It's
[24:07] automatic to love one another. It's
[24:10] automatic to just
[24:13] &gt;&gt; fulfill your word to be written epistles
[24:16] read and known of all men. YES.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; AND FATHER, THERE ARE NEEDS amongst your
[24:22] body this morning. Lord, there are
[24:25] several that need a healing touch. my
[24:28] brother and sister Julie and Lord uh our
[24:33] brother Sar and different ones I can't
[24:37] remember them all but you know them
[24:40] father they were expressed they they
[24:43] were read out loud you're mindful of
[24:46] each and everyone you're not partial
[24:49] towards anyone we call you on the scene
[24:53] our great physician our high priest that
[24:56] can be touched but the feelings of our
[24:58] infirmities. And by your stripes, we are
[25:01] healed. And we believe deliverance. We
[25:04] believe all that we have need of. This
[25:07] is testing time. THE TEMPTATIONS ARE
[25:10] COMING. THE TESTS ARE COMING. BUT
[25:13] GREATER HE IS IN us than he is in the
[25:15] world. Put Jesus first. We must put you
[25:21] first in everything. You must have the
[25:24] preeminence.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, God. and all the unspoken prayer
[25:27] requests. You know, each and every
[25:29] heart, may you grant to them whatever
[25:32] they have need of um more so than than
[25:36] what they can ever expect to receive
[25:38] from you. Amen. For your gracious and
[25:40] loving God. And Lord, bless our pastor
[25:43] as he labors faithfully to bring forth
[25:46] your word. Lord, use them to speak to
[25:49] our hearts. We want to be ready, Father.
[25:52] We want to be prayed up. We want to hear
[25:55] the word for we want to be your
[25:59] &gt;&gt; true representative of Jesus Christ here
[26:02] on this earth.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Granted, Father, in your name we pray.

[26:37] Amen.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; I don't want him to be like Jesus with
[26:40] dirty feet. Jesus was invited to come to
[26:42] the party. When he got there, he wasn't
[26:44] welcome.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to make him feel welcome.
[26:48] We've invited him. We want to make him
[26:49] feel by our presence, by our worship. We

[33:05] live.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Just have humanity. Just come to God.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Forget about Let go of these other
[33:12] things. Just come to God.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. That's what we
[33:16] need more than anything is the Lord
[33:19] Jesus.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Anyone have anything?
[33:23] Amen. Testimony or something on your
[33:25] heart?
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother Dennis.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, I have a testimony. I don't want to
[33:31] reiterate what I just said about Danny.
[33:33] The Fridays I go and see my podiatrist.
[33:37] I'm seeing a new one. And he does that
[33:41] where he trims all the disc in and all.
[33:45] And um Friday night I was in such pain I
[33:50] couldn't sleep all night. So yesterday I
[33:53] spent a lot of time just resting and I
[33:56] prayed Lord I want to go to church.
[33:59] Don't let me have a painful night. I
[34:01] won't be able to go. Last night I was
[34:03] painree.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Give him the glory.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Jesus.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. God is good. Amen. Praise his
[34:15] name. Anyone else?
[34:20] Amen. If not, let's stand to our feet.
[34:22] Amen. We'll go right to the scripture
[34:24] here. We're going to go over to Romans
[34:25] chapter 8.
[34:27] Amen. We're going to get back on to uh
[34:30] the subject we had left off of. This
[34:32] will be adoption part 32, five-fold
[34:35] ministry part five. Amen. And this will
[34:38] be the subtext of apostles. We're going
[34:41] to try to start delving into the
[34:43] powerful ministry here for the next few
[34:45] services. And the first one we're going
[34:47] to take is apostles uh or missionaries,
[34:50] whichever way a person wants to say
[34:52] that. Uh as we'll be here in a minute,
[34:55] we find out that they're one and the
[34:57] same. Apostle, missionary, same thing.
[34:59] Amen. And you'll also see when I read my
[35:02] first quote here from Brother Brandham,
[35:03] why we picked apostles to be the first.
[35:06] Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but Romans chapter 8, as we
[35:10] are back into our adoption here now
[35:12] after a couple of services, uh I want to
[35:14] go to the 14th ch uh 14th vers 8th
[35:17] chapter, 14th verse. Amen. And read this
[35:19] again before we go over to Ephesians 4.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we do, let's just bow our
[35:24] heads for another word of prayer.
[35:26] Father, we're so very thankful again of
[35:28] Lord those that have come, Lord, and the
[35:30] songs that we sung and just to worship
[35:32] you and praise you, Father, and just
[35:34] create an atmosphere in a way that Lord,
[35:36] you do feel welcome, God, to be here
[35:39] because you inhabit the praises of your
[35:41] people. And we know Lord as we are
[35:43] praising, worshiping you, giving you
[35:45] thanksgiving with the fruit of our lips,
[35:47] lifting you up, God, and praising you in
[35:50] worship with all that we have, Father,
[35:51] and our the strength of our being,
[35:54] Father, and all the ways that we know
[35:55] how to be able to verbalize it and to
[35:58] move our bodies and to raise our hands
[36:00] and just to worship you, Lord Jesus. We
[36:03] just trust and believe. Know, God, that
[36:05] you are here. Yes,
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Lord. We don't need a tingle down our
[36:09] spine or our hair growing on end or we
[36:12] just need to know that your word says
[36:14] that you would be here, Father. Yes. Two
[36:16] or three are gathered in your name and
[36:18] we are here in your name, Lord. Not in
[36:20] the name of a denomination, not in the
[36:22] name of a pastor, but we come in the
[36:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you
[36:26] promised in that name, Father, there's
[36:29] power, there's strength, there's
[36:30] healing, God. And in that name is where
[36:33] you will meet the worshipper, Father.
[36:34] And we are your worshippers today. and
[36:37] trust and believe, God, in your house
[36:39] here today, in your house. Yes. God, we
[36:41] meet with you. We thank you, Father, for
[36:44] this word. As we pull back the pages of
[36:46] this word, may you just reveal it to our
[36:48] hearts. Help us to see and know and hear
[36:51] what you would have us to know today,
[36:52] God. Bless us by it as we commit it into
[36:55] your hands. Speak through these lips,
[36:57] Lord.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Only the words that you would be heard
[36:59] today, God, and anoint our ears to
[37:02] receive it. Let it not return void.
[37:04] accomplish that in each that you desired
[37:07] for it to before the foundation of the
[37:09] world. We commit it to your hands now
[37:11] asking your uh your blessings upon it in
[37:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[37:16] pray. Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans chapter 8 verse14
[37:21] as many as are led by the spirit of God,
[37:23] they are the sons of God. For you have
[37:25] not received the spirit of bondage again
[37:27] to fear, but you have received the
[37:29] spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba
[37:31] father. The spirit itself beareth
[37:33] witness with our spirit that we are the
[37:36] children of God. I love that. We are the
[37:38] children of God. And if children then
[37:41] hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If
[37:45] so be that we suffer with him that we
[37:47] may be also glorified together. You can
[37:49] be seated if you'd like. Amen. I like
[37:52] the other day when brother Ze was here,
[37:54] he read that scripture too. of all the
[37:56] scriptures in the Bible, he took that
[37:58] scripture as a part of his reading and
[38:00] read it.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Let you know the Lord is mindful of us.
[38:06] Amen.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Does me. Praise the Lord. Now, let's go
[38:10] to Ephesians chapter 4. We're going to
[38:12] uh start here. Go back into the uh the
[38:16] five-fold ministry. Ephesians chapter 4.
[38:19] I want to read just those few verses of
[38:21] scripture. We we've gone through most of
[38:24] this fourth chapter and of course the
[38:26] latter part of it and recognizing the
[38:28] things the purposes of that ministry,
[38:31] the reason the Lord's put this ministry
[38:33] in our lives and and recognize that the
[38:36] that that a God- called minister is a
[38:38] carrier of the gospel and the gospel is
[38:40] the good news.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; To bring good news, to bring good
[38:44] tidings to his people. Yes.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:48] That's why the Lord, that's one reason
[38:50] the Lord gives them gives to us, that
[38:54] ministry. Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, let's go over
[38:57] Ephesians 4. Uh, we'll just begin
[38:59] reading with verse 11. And he and he
[39:03] gave. Now, I want you to notice here as
[39:04] we as we've it's been a few weeks, so
[39:06] we'll go back. And he Amen. That is God.
[39:10] Praise the Lord. Not a man, not a
[39:13] church. Amen. not a person, not by
[39:15] laying on of hands, which a lot of
[39:17] people, a lot of apostolics, even um
[39:20] Pentecostals
[39:22] took from the laying on of hands that
[39:24] they believe they were imparting the
[39:26] gift to someone. That is not it. Amen.
[39:28] Brother Brandham teaches very uh uh very
[39:31] well, very correctly,
[39:35] soundly that the laying on of hand is
[39:37] just an acknowledgement. Amen. I forgot.
[39:40] trying to remember what uh what message
[39:43] it is that brother Bham um is trying to
[39:46] hurry. They're on they're on the hookup
[39:49] and uh a brother had brother Brandham
[39:52] had I guess had um told this brother he
[39:55] would he would dedicate he would not
[39:57] dedicate but he would um uh uh anoint
[39:59] him. He would lay hands on him. He would
[40:02] um what's it called? Minister, anoint
[40:09] &gt;&gt; No, it was ordained.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Ordain, lay hands on to as an as a sign
[40:15] of ordination. And brother Brandham
[40:18] comes and he has other brothers come up
[40:20] and lay hands on and another brother
[40:22] comes and another brother comes and it's
[40:24] like there's like 15 brothers in the
[40:27] first 30 minutes of this tape come up to
[40:29] be have a hands laid on and reckon. But
[40:32] brother Brandham in that tape he made
[40:35] sure to that we understand that it
[40:37] wasn't imparting the gift of anything on
[40:40] that person but in the recognition that
[40:44] God has given that gift to that person.
[40:46] It's an acknowledgment, an ordination,
[40:49] acknowledgment of recognition that we
[40:52] that we recognize or those around or
[40:54] those that we trust and believe to be
[40:56] godly people uh recognize and see
[40:59] there's a gift on this person. And that
[41:02] laying on of hands is simply an
[41:04] acknowledgment of that.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Bible says he [snorts]
[41:09] gave. That's God. Not us. Not a man, not
[41:13] a preacher, not a prophet, not a a a
[41:16] church, but God. Amen. God is the one
[41:19] that does it. Praise the Lord. So you
[41:22] say, "Well, why is that so important,
[41:23] Brother New Mute?" Because because it
[41:26] has to be God sent or it's man-made.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And if it's not God sent, it's man-made,
[41:31] then it it it results in nothing. Amen.
[41:35] a disaster, it it results in nothing but
[41:38] a a
[41:40] should I say a a faster, easier path to
[41:43] hell.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; When someone's not called of God,
[41:47] someone's not called of God, like we
[41:49] said before, God's not obligated to keep
[41:51] that person on the word. If that
[41:53] person's ministering and they're not
[41:55] obligate, God's not obligated to keep
[41:56] that person on the word and they're
[41:58] ministering and not on the word, then
[42:00] where does that lead? right?
[42:02] &gt;&gt; That leads them astray from God.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is a church? If we don't have
[42:07] the word,
[42:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Uh if you don't have the message of the
[42:10] hour, the truth of your day, if you
[42:12] don't have the word of God in a church,
[42:15] then we are exactly what brother
[42:16] Brandham said we were. And brother Green
[42:18] iterated many times. We are nothing but
[42:21] a lot. We are nothing but a building
[42:24] where people of like opinion drift
[42:27] together to find out what's for lunch or
[42:29] what they're wearing or what they did
[42:31] this week or what their opinion might be
[42:33] or what this we just become a lodge.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without that the if the if the
[42:38] church is devoid of the word then what
[42:41] do we have? It's if it's devoid of the
[42:44] word IT'S DEVOID OF GOD.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; YES.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It must have the word. It must
[42:49] have the purity of the word. I was
[42:50] talking to a brother the other day and
[42:53] he was talking about how some of the
[42:55] things of the world are creeping into
[42:57] the people and their dress and stuff
[42:59] like that. I said, "Well, the the the if
[43:01] the if the pure unadulterated word is
[43:04] not preached, then that's going to
[43:06] happen."
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. It doesn't matter if you you don't
[43:09] have I don't have to stand up here every
[43:11] single service and pound you about how
[43:13] you dress and pound you about how your
[43:15] hair is supposed to be and pound you
[43:16] about how what you how you're supposed
[43:18] to live and you don't that doesn't have
[43:20] to be done because the pure word
[43:23] corrects the error. Word always corrects
[43:25] error.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Doesn't have to be said every single
[43:28] time. It's the spirit that comes and
[43:31] that spirit is what anoints and what
[43:33] brings that word alive to the people
[43:35] that changes their lives. And when the
[43:38] word changes the life, then you don't
[43:40] have to worry about a man doing anything
[43:42] or someone coming and and having to
[43:44] berate you about something all the time.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, because the word, the
[43:49] purity of the word, the Holy Spirit is
[43:51] there.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. When the Holy Spirit is there, then
[43:54] the whole atmosphere changes, lives
[43:57] change, hearts change, people change.
[44:00] Amen. Your life will be different when
[44:02] God comes.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When he gives, it's he,
[44:06] God. God's the one that does this. God's
[44:09] the call. He gave some apostles,
[44:14] some prophets, some evangelists, some
[44:16] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[44:19] of the saints, for the work of the
[44:21] ministry, for the edifying of the body
[44:23] of Christ, who we all come in the unity
[44:26] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[44:28] son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[44:30] measure of the stature of the fullness
[44:33] of Christ.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God the the reasons God
[44:37] gave that five-fold ministry. Now, as we
[44:40] said, we want to start with the we want
[44:43] to start with the five-fold uh with the
[44:45] apostle and the five-fold ministry.
[44:49] But before we do that, I want to show
[44:52] you again as many of you have already
[44:55] know, I want to I want to show again and
[44:58] illustrate. Maybe somebody who's
[45:00] watching may not have ever seen it or
[45:01] may watch it archived what brother
[45:04] Brandham taught brother Green, what
[45:06] brother Green taught me. Amen. And I say
[45:09] he may have taught others. I don't know.
[45:10] May have shown to others. I don't know.
[45:12] But I know he did me. And I'll never
[45:14] forget the first time brother Green
[45:16] showed me. We were in town visiting. I
[45:19] was pastoring in St. Augustine, Florida.
[45:21] And we come in December to visit. We
[45:23] went to the IHOP on Grant Road to have
[45:26] dinner. Brother Green was sitting there
[45:28] with a lot of people. And we we had got
[45:30] up and different ones were talking to
[45:32] him. You know, he was, you know, Brother
[45:34] Green just had that personality. People
[45:36] gravitated to him. Everybody was talking
[45:38] to him and things and uh he stopped me
[45:41] and he grabbed me by the arm and we
[45:42] started talking. I was just standing he
[45:44] was sitting there. I was standing there
[45:46] right next to him and for some reason we
[45:48] got on this subject and he showed me the
[45:50] thing that brother Brandham showed him
[45:52] about the five-fold ministry. I don't
[45:53] remember why or we were talking about
[45:55] the five-fold ministry but he showed me
[45:57] what brother Brandham showed him. The
[45:59] five-fold ministry is like your hand.
[46:01] the five-fold ministry. There's five
[46:03] fingers uh on on on your hand that
[46:08] represents the five-fold ministry. He
[46:10] said now the each one brother Brandham
[46:14] taught him identified a ministry. Uh the
[46:19] first ministry, the first one was a
[46:22] prophet. Amen. The index finger is a
[46:24] prophet. Thus sayaeth the Lord.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; He said when a prophet says thus sayeth
[46:28] the Lord, it's thus sayeth the Lord. the
[46:30] prophet. Amen. The second is the teacher
[46:34] uh uh the apostle. Amen. The apostles
[46:37] usually if you put your hand up, you'll
[46:40] notice almost every hand, if not every
[46:42] hand, this finger, what do you call
[46:45] that? That finger, it's not the ring
[46:48] finger. I can't I forget the name of
[46:50] that finger. Anyway, that finger is
[46:52] almost always the longest finger.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which means that when the hand
[46:58] goes out, that's the first finger that
[47:00] meets them.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes that the apostle, the
[47:04] missionary.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; The the one that goes in first. Amen.
[47:09] Into a church, into an area, into a
[47:11] place to try to establish Amen. Remember
[47:14] when uh excuse me, you remember when uh
[47:19] uh brother Green
[47:21] uh baptized brother Galdona? Uh, brother
[47:25] Van told that testimony. I've heard it I
[47:27] don't know how many times. It would be
[47:28] very difficult for me to forget uh that
[47:31] name even as difficult as it may be. He
[47:33] went and bapt he went to brother Bham
[47:36] said [clears throat] this brother he
[47:37] said wants to be baptized. He said
[47:39] brother Bam said well then baptize him.
[47:41] So brother Green takes him and baptize
[47:43] him. He goes back to brother Bam. He
[47:45] says okay baptize brother God only. He
[47:48] said now go preach for him. Amen. Down
[47:50] in Central America. I forgot where is
[47:52] Guatemala somewhere. down in Central
[47:54] America is Hispanic. Said that now go
[47:56] preach for him. Go do what?
[47:59] &gt;&gt; First man in
[48:01] &gt;&gt; go establish. Yes.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; See that message, that truth. That word
[48:05] that was come uh uh for for a bride for
[48:09] this day. Amen. Was that apostle, the
[48:12] missionary is the first one out. He's
[48:15] the first he's the longest one on your
[48:17] hand. So, he's the first one that goes
[48:18] when you when you go to shake somebody's
[48:20] hand, he's the first one that that's
[48:22] there to meet them. Amen. The next one,
[48:25] the ring finger is the teacher. Amen.
[48:28] The teacher. The teacher is so to where
[48:32] a a teacher can't do anything without
[48:36] already having the uh a ministry
[48:39] established. Right?
[48:41] &gt;&gt; So, if you take away the prophet, you
[48:44] take away the uh the apostle, the
[48:47] missionary, and you take away the
[48:49] evangelist, which is the little pinky,
[48:51] cuz he's the little fiery guy that's
[48:53] over on the end that has he can go and
[48:55] do and be and he he's he's loose and
[48:59] free and uh but but the but the
[49:02] teacher's bound. Amen. He's bound. If
[49:05] you take away these others, I don't know
[49:07] how you can see us very well. You try to
[49:10] do it on your chair. Amen. Maybe little
[49:13] kids, you can try this. Amen. Put your
[49:15] hand down like that. Take away the
[49:18] prophet and the the apostle and the and
[49:21] the uh evangelist and see if you can
[49:23] move your teacher.
[49:26] Can't move him.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; The teacher can't move if he doesn't
[49:31] already have the others in place. Now if
[49:34] you got if you got the apostle if you
[49:36] got the apostle in place apostles gone
[49:38] in and established the work a teacher
[49:40] can come in because an apostles just as
[49:45] our subject today is on the apostle our
[49:48] apostle is the one he's a foundational
[49:51] preacher he's a foundational uh minister
[49:54] that goes in and lays the foundation
[49:57] usually he'll go in and lay that faith
[49:59] foundation the statue of a perfect man
[50:03] to build on that that apostle is very
[50:06] important to have something established
[50:08] enough so a building that is strong
[50:11] enough in faith in the word that it can
[50:13] be built upon. Amen. Yes.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; And and once the introduction of that
[50:18] happens, see an an apostle doesn't
[50:21] teach, he doesn't necessarily bring
[50:23] forth doctrine. He'll lay the foundation
[50:25] of doctrine, but it takes the others to
[50:28] come in. Amen. Not so much the
[50:31] evangelist, even though the evangelist
[50:33] can have some doctrine. Evangelist
[50:35] doesn't normally give doctrine, but he
[50:37] can. But a a pastor and a and a teacher
[50:41] can bring in some doctrine. So if you've
[50:43] got if you've got the prophet or you've
[50:45] got the teacher there that's the apostle
[50:47] that's already done, you the teacher can
[50:49] move then.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he if he's been established,
[50:53] but if you take them away, you can't
[50:55] have the teacher. You can't have the
[50:57] teacher unless there's already been
[50:58] somebody in there to establish that work
[51:01] and to bring that ministry forward.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Now, the the evangelist, like we said,
[51:07] is the little fiery guy on the end. I
[51:09] mean, you can take all these guys away
[51:10] and that that evangelist can still move
[51:12] and go whichever way he wants to go.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can do what he wants to do.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. because he's that
[51:19] evangelist that's independent and moves
[51:21] around and can can be and go and do
[51:24] whatever God tells him to do.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; That that is one of the main reasons if
[51:31] not the reason I believe that God told
[51:33] Brother Brandham to do the work of an
[51:35] evangelist.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Didn't say he was an evangelist but said
[51:39] do the work of an evangelist.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham wasn't he wasn't
[51:45] adhered to anybody.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; He wasn't stuck to any denomination.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; He he didn't have to worry about who was
[51:52] going to fund him or who was going to
[51:54] sponsor him. Now, he had sponsors, of
[51:56] course, he had people that would help
[51:57] him. God God would send people, but you
[52:00] recognize the one time, see, brother
[52:03] Brandham, God told Brother Bam, do the
[52:06] work of an evangelist. But the one time
[52:09] you go read it in uh is it prophet visit
[52:12] South Africa? I forget. It's been a long
[52:14] time since I read um or or or even the
[52:17] supernatural books.
[52:20] Brother Adam went overseas and he was
[52:23] sponsored by these by these brothers. Uh
[52:27] uh I can't even remember which which
[52:30] organization it was that sponsored it,
[52:31] but these brothers sponsored it. And
[52:34] they're like, "Okay, Brother Brown,
[52:35] you're going to go here and you're going
[52:37] to be here and you're going to do this
[52:38] and you're going to preach here and
[52:40] you're going to go to this town and
[52:41] you're going to go to this town." And
[52:43] they're telling them where he's going to
[52:44] go. Amen.
[52:46] But this one time, God said, "Don't go
[52:50] with them. You go over here."
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Right? I want you over here to this
[52:56] other town, to this other church, to
[52:57] this other place. Don't you go over
[52:59] there. Amen. And brother Brandham in
[53:03] himself admittedly compromised
[53:06] compromised the integrity of his
[53:08] evangelistic spirit where he was
[53:11] supposed to go where God sends him. Not
[53:13] where man sends him, where God sends
[53:14] him.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; You go where God sends you. See? And God
[53:18] said, "Go here." And those brothers
[53:19] said, "No, we've already got you set up
[53:21] over here." And he said, 'But God told
[53:24] me to go here, but we need you to go
[53:26] over here. So, Brother Brandham
[53:28] trying to be as as he was. You all know,
[53:32] you listen to his message, you wouldn't
[53:34] think so sometimes, but he was a people
[53:36] pleaser.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not ever want to
[53:38] hurt anybody's feelings, right?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; He always wanted to get along and uh
[53:44] please people and and and just kind of
[53:46] go along. So he went along and went over
[53:49] with these brothers and he disobeyed
[53:51] God. Told him to go over here. He went
[53:53] over here with these brothers and said,
[53:54] "We had this all set up for you." He
[53:56] said nothing. He said there was no God
[53:59] in that place. There was no movement of
[54:00] God. There was nothing that happened. It
[54:02] don't matter if people fall down crying,
[54:05] screaming, yelling or come to the altar,
[54:06] whatever. If God's not there, it doesn't
[54:08] matter.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Emotional make you do almost anything.
[54:11] Saint
[54:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Emotional bring you to an altar.
[54:14] Emotional make you cry and scream.
[54:15] emotion will make you shout and dance.
[54:18] Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; But if the spirit of God's not there,
[54:20] it's just you,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And when he disobeyed God and he went to
[54:25] where he wasn't supposed to because he's
[54:27] supposed to be an evangelist. You go and
[54:28] do what I tell you what God said. Amen.
[54:32] And he went do what these brothers told
[54:34] him. We already have you set up over. He
[54:36] went over there and got so sick. He got
[54:38] this amieba or something in him in his
[54:41] system in his stomach. It like to killed
[54:43] him. It almost killed him. He had to go
[54:47] and apologize. And he went to the
[54:49] brothers and apologized. He apologized
[54:51] to God. Amen. And and this amoeba that
[54:54] got in his body from disobeying God
[54:56] almost killed him.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Almost took his life. You see, because
[55:00] an evangelist is supposed to go
[55:02] according to where the spirit leads.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Where God tells him to go, what God
[55:07] tells him to do. Right.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it seems like nowadays.
[55:11] Uh
[55:13] it's not all together that way. We kind
[55:16] of set up programs and we set up
[55:19] appointments and all this and do these
[55:21] things instead of just saying, "Okay,
[55:23] God told me to come out." And then I no
[55:26] offense to anybody and I love all the
[55:29] brothers that come and preach and the
[55:31] the few that we actually have here but I
[55:34] can't remember the last time somebody's
[55:35] called me on the phone and said you know
[55:37] brother Newton God just told me to come
[55:38] preach for your group. You know how much
[55:41] respect I would have for someone like
[55:42] that. But when it's really true and I
[55:46] would believe that as it has happened
[55:48] that way because it has happened that
[55:50] the Lord would be speaking to me as well
[55:53] &gt;&gt; about this brother. Amen. To have it.
[55:56] Amen. I I've had somebody on my heart
[55:58] that I felt should be coming out. I'm
[56:01] waiting for God to speak to him or at
[56:02] least I'm waiting for him to listen as
[56:04] God's trying to tell him um to come and
[56:07] and and minister to our group. Amen. But
[56:11] that's up to him. That's between him and
[56:13] the Lord. But you see, he should be free
[56:16] to go and do if he needs to go overseas
[56:18] to go overseas. If he needs to go to a
[56:21] hole in the wall in a nobody town of
[56:25] nowhere, Tucson, Arizona, then that's
[56:28] where you go. If you go when there's two
[56:31] people or you go where there's 2,000,
[56:33] you go where God tells you to do. The
[56:35] whole point of a of an of a
[56:39] an evangelist is to be able to be led of
[56:41] God.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Now, they're all supposed to be led of
[56:44] God. But you understand, he's free. Not
[56:46] like, see, a pastor would be uh would be
[56:50] someone that's here. See that the
[56:52] pastor's the thumb now,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Uh he's he's the one that solidifies it,
[56:58] brings it all together. So, he talked
[57:00] about the five-fold ministry. If this
[57:01] five-fold ministry comes together the
[57:03] way they're supposed to and the and the
[57:06] pastor comes and seals that together,
[57:08] you got a weapon to beat the devil with.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Then you got something you can fight
[57:13] with. You got something you can beat the
[57:15] devil with.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When it when it comes
[57:19] all together, but see that pastor, he's
[57:20] got a place to stay.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; He's got a place a post of duty that
[57:26] that he's responsible to a people he's
[57:28] responsible for. Amen. He can't just
[57:31] He's not that he's not let of gone, but
[57:34] he doesn't just go to this country next
[57:36] week or to this state next week or the
[57:38] Amen. He's got to be where at his post
[57:41] of duty where God has established him to
[57:44] be.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, a a a teacher, a a p a
[57:48] prophet can go wherever he wants to take
[57:51] thus sayith the Lord. He's led of God.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that that prophet is is
[57:58] relegated to where what God would do for
[58:01] him, where God would send him, what God
[58:03] wants for him to do. But today, I I want
[58:06] to take a few moments after after our
[58:10] demonstration,
[58:11] which uh you have to bear with me
[58:13] because I may do that again.
[58:16] If there's some people that aren't here
[58:18] that may be here uh in the next week or
[58:20] so with that five-fold ministry, but I I
[58:24] want to talk about day and I don't get
[58:26] started, there's no way I'll ever get
[58:28] done. Uh but I want to talk today about
[58:31] apostle. Look what this u say why we
[58:34] start with apostle. Well, it has in here
[58:36] the scripture and he gave some apostles.
[58:39] That was the first one that was
[58:41] mentioned in the scripture. He's the
[58:43] first one that goes in and brother
[58:46] Brandham said then besides that he's got
[58:48] five ministerial offices. First is
[58:52] apostles. So I felt safe in starting
[58:55] with apostles. And brother Brandham
[58:57] himself said first is apostles or as we
[59:01] said a little earlier or missionaries.
[59:04] The word apostle means one sent. A
[59:07] missionary means one sent. Amen. Not a
[59:11] pastor. A pastor is not one sent
[59:14] although you see a lot of pastors like
[59:17] you would think they were sent to go out
[59:18] to this church that church and the rest
[59:20] country and that country and all over
[59:22] the world. I I don't necessarily agree
[59:24] that if someone if the pastor wants to
[59:26] go check out a work that was established
[59:28] somewhere or if they want to go make
[59:30] sure the finances of that church that
[59:32] went to this uh this their missionary uh
[59:36] offerings went to this specific work and
[59:38] to go check it out if there's nobody
[59:39] else there. I I would imagine once a
[59:43] year or something would be okay. But a
[59:45] pastor to just to go all the time to
[59:47] here to there and be gone twothirds of
[59:50] the half the time away from their church
[59:52] and say I just I don't agree with that.
[59:54] Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; But anyway,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Apostle means one cent. Missionary means
[1:00:00] one cent. Amen. So missionary and
[1:00:04] apostle that basically makes them
[1:00:05] missionary and apostles same thing.
[1:00:08] Amen. They're both one scent who God
[1:00:11] sent. Amen. Which reminds me of what
[1:00:15] brother Brandham told Brother Green.
[1:00:17] Amen. Go preach for him.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I don't say that because
[1:00:23] Brother Green's not here. I told Brother
[1:00:25] Green this to his face. And Brother
[1:00:27] Green knew it. And several times
[1:00:29] actually behind the pull pit he would
[1:00:31] talk about that, but not very often
[1:00:32] because people get so confused when it
[1:00:35] comes to this five-fold ministry. Right.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and everybody wants to people
[1:00:40] want to uh first of all they want to
[1:00:43] take and put God in a box and just say
[1:00:46] oh God okay God it's supposed to be this
[1:00:48] way and this is supposed to be this way
[1:00:50] and this supposed to be this way. It's
[1:00:51] going to be the way God wants it to be.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he's working with his
[1:00:55] with his men when he's working with his
[1:00:57] ministry it's up to God to do what he
[1:00:59] wants to do to put them where he wants
[1:01:02] them to establish them where he wants
[1:01:03] them to be. That's God's choice not our
[1:01:06] choice.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It wasn't, no offense, uh, I
[1:01:10] love you all more than life. Uh, but
[1:01:14] Tucson wasn't my first choice to come
[1:01:16] to. It might have been my wife's, but it
[1:01:19] wasn't mine. Uh, I wouldn't have come
[1:01:21] here if God hadn't sent me here.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't have been where I was if
[1:01:26] God hadn't done what he does and told me
[1:01:28] what he told me. Amen. I And I don't
[1:01:31] move off that till he moves me.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; When he moves me, then I move. They go a
[1:01:36] different way. Amen. People think that
[1:01:40] people think I started this church
[1:01:43] because of the vote and what happened in
[1:01:44] the tabernacle. That's not true. I did
[1:01:47] not start this church. In fact, when I
[1:01:49] got up to resign from Tucson Tabernacle,
[1:01:52] I knew God was just telling me to leave.
[1:01:55] I had brothers, maybe even brother
[1:01:57] Dennis, call me and say, "Well, brother,
[1:02:00] what are you doing?"
[1:02:02] I but I didn't announce it the when I
[1:02:04] resigned from the tabernacle. I didn't
[1:02:06] resign. I didn't tell everybody now I'm
[1:02:08] starting a church and I'm going to be
[1:02:10] the pastor and I'm going to be located
[1:02:12] over here and here and do this.
[1:02:16] Proeliting is of the devil.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing to do with it.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I didn't want anybody I think
[1:02:22] whoever called me may have been Dennis.
[1:02:24] I've had a couple people call said,
[1:02:26] "Well, are you you know?" I said, "Well,
[1:02:28] you know, since you're asking
[1:02:30] personally, this is what I feel the
[1:02:31] Lord's led me to do." I didn't do it
[1:02:33] because of what happened over there.
[1:02:36] But when that happened, what God told me
[1:02:40] in Florida,
[1:02:43] I could see had had come to its end.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I had accomplished and fulfilled what
[1:02:48] God told me to do. Now, if others if
[1:02:52] circumstances or opinions of men or
[1:02:54] something got in the way of the finality
[1:02:56] of that, that's up to God. That's not
[1:02:57] that's not up to me. But I didn't leave
[1:02:59] because of that. I I I I left out of
[1:03:03] there and I said, "Lord, because I felt
[1:03:05] my spirit uh that had just had just
[1:03:09] debilitated and I was like, Lord, well,
[1:03:12] then what am I supposed to do?" Cuz all
[1:03:14] that whole time, I knew I had a purpose,
[1:03:16] right? When I went to when I went to
[1:03:19] Xolo, when I went to to to the
[1:03:20] mountains, I knew and I told PEOPLE
[1:03:23] BEFORE I LEFT THAT I'd be back. I don't
[1:03:26] know who it was. I don't I think I told
[1:03:28] John Garboro uh in his living room one
[1:03:31] time. They they hated to see me and
[1:03:32] Sonia leaving. And I told him, I said,
[1:03:34] "Well, we'll be back. This is just
[1:03:37] temporary." And I knew it was uh I I I
[1:03:41] knew there was a reason. The Lord,
[1:03:43] Brother Green, had help at the time. I
[1:03:45] knew there was a reason. Amen. I'm
[1:03:47] probably getting into way too deep too
[1:03:48] deep more than I should, but um but I
[1:03:52] knew I knew he'd be back. Now, I didn't
[1:03:55] tell everybody that. I didn't tell the
[1:03:58] people up there that, but I knew it
[1:04:00] would only be for a short period of time
[1:04:01] because God didn't send me here to go up
[1:04:03] there. He sent me here to be here with
[1:04:05] Brother Green,
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; To help him. Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God stopped the work up
[1:04:10] there, when God called me and told me to
[1:04:12] come back down here is is the time that
[1:04:15] Brother Green started needing someone
[1:04:16] the most
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; and and it was like perfect timing. And
[1:04:20] then he plugged me right in and away we
[1:04:23] went, you know. But when that happened,
[1:04:26] I just felt that de and [clears throat]
[1:04:28] up to that time I knew the purpose God
[1:04:30] gave me. I felt renewed and re rever
[1:04:35] renewed every day. a new fervor.
[1:04:38] [clears throat]
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; But when that happened, I felt like it
[1:04:40] just it just all drained out. That was
[1:04:42] the end of it. It was over. I walked out
[1:04:44] of the church that day. And I was
[1:04:46] walking through the parking lot. I said,
[1:04:47] "Lord, what do you want me to do now?"
[1:04:50] Amen. And I I I felt something come
[1:04:53] over. It's like, you know, go see your
[1:04:55] mom. And my mom was sick at the time.
[1:04:58] And I was going back and forth and she
[1:04:59] had uh a stroke and all and she couldn't
[1:05:02] take care of herself. And Michael was
[1:05:03] helping some. And I was I was going to
[1:05:06] be with her as much as I possibly could.
[1:05:08] Amen. And when I went back there and I
[1:05:12] spent some time alone and I spent some
[1:05:13] time in prayer, uh I felt like the Lord
[1:05:16] spoke to me and the next thing was when
[1:05:18] I got back was to start that work. And
[1:05:19] so when I got back, I went and resigned
[1:05:22] the church and I started the work over
[1:05:24] on Cterero,
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Which which is what I felt the Lord told
[1:05:28] me to do.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I had no place to go. I had no church
[1:05:31] building. I had no people. I had no I
[1:05:34] had nothing but a word that God told me
[1:05:38] to do. So So I did and I I didn't know
[1:05:44] where to go. I didn't have any money. I
[1:05:46] I had I had nothing to pay for anything.
[1:05:49] I had no church building or I had
[1:05:52] nothing.
[1:05:53] [snorts] And I saw on
[1:05:58] Craigslist
[1:06:00] that church that we had in Cortoro that
[1:06:02] we were sharing with that other church
[1:06:05] uh that they were looking for somebody
[1:06:08] to come and fill in uh some empty time
[1:06:12] and it wanted $250 a week. And I thought
[1:06:16] I just I folded up said well I there's
[1:06:18] no way I could do that. I don't I don't
[1:06:22] hardly have any money period anyway. So,
[1:06:24] um I there's no way I could do anything
[1:06:27] like that. But me and my wife were out
[1:06:29] and I forgot how why we ended up down
[1:06:32] there. We went to Walmart or something
[1:06:34] down on Cortoo. We ended up down that
[1:06:36] way somehow and all of a sudden it came
[1:06:38] back to my mind and I drove I I didn't
[1:06:42] remember didn't look it up. I drove
[1:06:44] right to it is right there is dur is in
[1:06:47] the middle of the day when nobody's
[1:06:49] supposed to be there and I walk up I
[1:06:52] open the door it's wide open I walk in
[1:06:54] and I look and the pastor standing right
[1:06:56] there with some other brothers he said
[1:06:57] can I help you
[1:06:59] I said well I don't know and then I just
[1:07:03] started talking to him about I found
[1:07:05] this and Craig said he said yeah yeah
[1:07:07] that's it's still it's still available
[1:07:09] it's still an option and I said well I
[1:07:11] don't know why I walked in here he said
[1:07:13] well I do cuz we're not I wasn't even he
[1:07:15] said I wasn't even supposed to be here.
[1:07:17] I he told me he said I'm not even
[1:07:19] supposed to be here. We're not supposed
[1:07:20] to be here. This all got changed and
[1:07:22] rearranged so we would be here right now
[1:07:24] at this time and you walked in at the
[1:07:26] perfect time.
[1:07:28] He said you you are you interested? I
[1:07:30] said yeah but I you know we need a place
[1:07:34] to worship. I said but uh I there's no
[1:07:37] way I could afford that. He said what
[1:07:39] can you afford? I said nothing.
[1:07:42] And he said, "Well, I tell you what." He
[1:07:44] said, "How about $100 a week?" And I
[1:07:46] thought, "If if this is if God's telling
[1:07:49] me to do this and he can't afford $100 a
[1:07:52] week for this, then it's not him."
[1:07:56] So I said, "Okay." And that's where we
[1:07:58] started. That's how it got started.
[1:08:00] Amen. Had not had nothing to do with
[1:08:02] everything else. It's just following the
[1:08:04] leading of the Lord, right?
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; What is God calling you? What is God
[1:08:07] telling you?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had everything work out
[1:08:11] just perfect to be to start it to
[1:08:15] be what God wanted to be and it worked
[1:08:17] perfectly fine. And it got probably a
[1:08:19] little too comfortable. So God sent us
[1:08:20] CO to get us out of there.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God got us out of there. I
[1:08:25] told you the story about this church.
[1:08:26] But anyway, when God does it, see, it's
[1:08:29] God orchestrating it, not man. It's not
[1:08:31] us. It's what God does.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are here, I believe,
[1:08:35] because God led you here.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. in one way or another, whether by
[1:08:40] dream or what, whatever, God led you
[1:08:43] here. Amen. And that's why you're here
[1:08:45] to be led of God. And that's all that we
[1:08:47] know. And that's all that we have.
[1:08:49] That's all we want to do is be led of
[1:08:51] God.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; When brother Bram talks about this as as
[1:08:56] in context of the five-fold ministry,
[1:09:00] uh it it it helps us understand and get
[1:09:03] a grasp of a lot of people don't. So
[1:09:06] when brother Grant when brother Green
[1:09:08] was in the position he was in, I
[1:09:10] understood the position he was in. I
[1:09:11] talked to him several times about it. He
[1:09:14] mentioned behind his pullpit a couple of
[1:09:16] times about it. Amen. He even said
[1:09:19] behind his own pullpit he wasn't a
[1:09:21] pastor or a good pastor or something
[1:09:23] like that cuz we all knew he the man was
[1:09:26] an apostle. He was supposed to be one
[1:09:29] that was sent. And he did that.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; ALL OVER THE WORLD.
[1:09:34] 13ome countries he went to,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He used to talk about how he flown
[1:09:39] over three or four million miles,
[1:09:41] whatever it was, and never one time saw
[1:09:43] the oxygen mass drop in front of him.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, and that's back in the uh in the
[1:09:50] 60s,7s and when air where air uh travel
[1:09:53] wasn't like it is today and all that
[1:09:56] because he was one that was sent,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; And God sent him. And look what he did
[1:10:01] in establishing all these churches all
[1:10:04] over the world and the things that have
[1:10:06] popped up from that. I mean it it I it's
[1:10:10] probably immeasurable
[1:10:12] to conceive
[1:10:15] the works that are going on of this
[1:10:17] message in the world today that brother
[1:10:20] Green had a hand in at some point in
[1:10:21] time in some way or another. It it just
[1:10:24] in it probably would boggle the mind if
[1:10:27] you went back and looked and saw how did
[1:10:29] this get started? How did this church
[1:10:31] get established? It had to start
[1:10:33] somewhere. There had to be one scent to
[1:10:36] go in there.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there can be one come off of
[1:10:39] there and start a work over here. There
[1:10:41] could be one come over there and start a
[1:10:43] work over here. But it started
[1:10:44] somewhere, right?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; It had to start at some point. Amen. And
[1:10:48] that's what brother Green was good at.
[1:10:51] That's why brother Brandham told him. I
[1:10:53] don't mean this to be all about brother
[1:10:55] Green, but that's why brother Brandham
[1:10:57] told him. He said, "Your birthday was
[1:11:00] significant because we know what the
[1:11:02] seven means." And brother Brand Brother
[1:11:04] Green said he never told him what the
[1:11:06] seven means. Amen. We know the seven
[1:11:08] means completion. But he but he said,
[1:11:11] Brother Brandham didn't tell him. He
[1:11:12] said, "We know what the seven means."
[1:11:14] And the one July 1st, the one in your
[1:11:17] birthday means you'll be good at
[1:11:19] starting things.
[1:11:21] I mean, [laughter] what other kind of
[1:11:24] confirmation do you need?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wrote and he said, "What are you
[1:11:29] going to get done? Get started before
[1:11:31] your 33rd birthday." July 1st, 1933. So,
[1:11:36] it it it just it just rang like a a a
[1:11:41] bell.
[1:11:42] Good at starting things, initiating,
[1:11:45] getting out there. Uh see God a lot of
[1:11:48] people didn't like brother brother
[1:11:50] Green's personality I guess uh and and
[1:11:54] some of maybe the way but brother but
[1:11:56] God made brother green the way he was to
[1:11:58] do what he did.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And some and it's like I wrote in
[1:12:02] my book, some of the some of the worst
[1:12:06] traits that Peter had. Big mouth Peter,
[1:12:09] I call them in my book, Big Mouth Peter.
[1:12:11] Some of the worst traits he had when
[1:12:14] when he was when he was before he became
[1:12:17] a a a disciple and and then a Christian
[1:12:20] and then born again before before all
[1:12:22] that was was a detriment TO HIM TO THE
[1:12:25] POINT THAT Jesus had to rebuke Peter and
[1:12:28] say, "Get behind me. Satan.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; He had gotten SO OUT OF CONTROL WITH HIS
[1:12:35] MOUTH and talking and always had to have
[1:12:37] something to say that it was a detriment
[1:12:40] to him. But those things, but when he
[1:12:43] became a Christian, God used those
[1:12:45] things.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He became the spokesman of the group.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. on the day of Pentecost WHEN THE
[1:12:52] HOLY SPIRIT FELL ON THEM, HE WAS THE ONE
[1:12:54] THAT STOOD OUT THERE AND SAID, "MEN AND
[1:12:56] BRETHREN, this is not what you think it
[1:12:58] is." Amen. He's the one that told them.
[1:13:02] He's the one that said, "You must be
[1:13:04] baptized. You must repent and be
[1:13:06] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:13:09] the remission of your sin. Then you can
[1:13:11] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[1:13:13] that promise is unto you and your
[1:13:15] children as far off. Whoever God will
[1:13:17] send, whoever God will lead. Praise the
[1:13:21] Lord.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That's what now that big mouth as God
[1:13:28] used it. It still got Peter in trouble
[1:13:30] later as you know in the scripture.
[1:13:33] Amen. But God made brother Green the way
[1:13:37] he made him for a purpose.
[1:13:40] to be the way he was for a reason. Amen.
[1:13:43] And his entrepreneurial spirit and and
[1:13:46] that probably is just an offshoot of of
[1:13:48] being someone who's good at starting
[1:13:50] stuff. Uh I mean that's basically what
[1:13:52] an entrepreneur is, isn't he? Someone
[1:13:54] who starts stuff. Well, that's just a
[1:13:56] you know, Brother Brandon, I think you
[1:13:57] even said one time that a lot of a lot
[1:14:00] of politicians out there have received
[1:14:03] uh a gift of ministry and they use it in
[1:14:07] in the wrong way.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Because we know politics is
[1:14:10] of the devil. It's of the world. It's
[1:14:13] all wicked and evil. But there's one
[1:14:15] side I agree with more, but it's all
[1:14:17] wicked because this is all it's part of
[1:14:19] the cosmos. It's part of the go Satan's
[1:14:22] economy. But anyway,
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; some of those people had that gift and
[1:14:28] they used it in a wrong way.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother but brother Green had
[1:14:32] the gifts he had for the reason he had.
[1:14:34] Amen. Let let me finish this.
[1:14:37] [clears throat]
[1:14:38] Missionary, apostle, apostle, one sent.
[1:14:40] Secondarily, prophets, evangelists,
[1:14:42] pastors, so forth. These are Godgiven
[1:14:46] gifts that set in the church. He Amen.
[1:14:50] gave. These are God-given gifts that are
[1:14:53] set in the church. They're predestinated
[1:14:55] of God and set in the church. God
[1:14:59] predestinates.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; It's not our calling.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't my wife's favorite thing
[1:15:04] when God called me in the ministry.
[1:15:07] wasn't my favorite thing, but it's God's
[1:15:10] calling. Yes.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; And if what we want to do is to fulfill
[1:15:13] the purpose of our lives for God in this
[1:15:15] life, then what we do is be led by his
[1:15:17] spirit and do what he tells us to do.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it's not always easy,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; especially like being an apostle. But I
[1:15:25] believe God prepares a person for each
[1:15:27] position that they're supposed to take.
[1:15:29] Like we've said before, your upbringing
[1:15:31] and your parents and your neighborhood
[1:15:32] and the pe the place you live and all
[1:15:35] everything brings it around to to mold
[1:15:38] that in your life. Amen. These are
[1:15:42] God-given. They're predestined of God
[1:15:44] set in the church. You can't make
[1:15:46] yourself be a uh be a minister.
[1:15:50] Although I I believe there's a lot of
[1:15:52] people do. Brother Ram says, "You can't
[1:15:55] make yourself," let's just say, I don't
[1:15:57] want to add to this message, but let's
[1:15:59] just say it this way. You can't make
[1:16:01] yourself be a minister of God,
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Or you can't make yourself a God- called
[1:16:07] minister.
[1:16:09] I I That probably explains it a little
[1:16:11] bit better because there's all kinds of
[1:16:13] people that minister that aren't
[1:16:15] supposed to, but that aren't God called.
[1:16:17] BUT WHEN GOD CALLS,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. God calls you to be to fulfill
[1:16:23] that position, then God is responsible
[1:16:25] to you.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; God is responsible for you. God is
[1:16:28] responsible to keep you on the word.
[1:16:30] Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; See, he says God got to call you to be a
[1:16:36] minister. Prophets are for ordained.
[1:16:38] They're prophets. He said, "Now there's
[1:16:40] a gift of prophecy, which maybe at some
[1:16:42] point in time we'll get along to the
[1:16:44] understanding of the difference between
[1:16:47] a a a a word prophet and a a gifted
[1:16:51] prophet, a a a man of prophecy, which
[1:16:55] can also be a woman in that case, a
[1:16:57] prophetess." Amen. A woman can be a
[1:17:00] prophet like that. She can't be a word
[1:17:03] called prophet like uh to carry the word
[1:17:06] because the Bible forbids that. But she
[1:17:09] can be a prophet as in giving prophecy
[1:17:11] to prophesy. Absolutely. [snorts] Amen.
[1:17:15] Prophets are for ordained. They're
[1:17:17] prophets. There's a gift of prophecy in
[1:17:19] the church that could be on one and not
[1:17:23] on the next one and so forth. But he
[1:17:25] said, "Now, greater than Solomon is
[1:17:27] here." Let me finish this for
[1:17:31] Greater Than Solomon is here.
[1:17:34] 1961. Now there's nine spiritual gifts
[1:17:38] that goes on in every local body. We
[1:17:40] believe that 1 Corinthians 12. Now
[1:17:45] some people would think that if you hold
[1:17:48] if you hold brother Brandham in a
[1:17:50] certain light as well I'll just say if
[1:17:53] you think he's God things like this will
[1:17:55] throw you off. That's why a lot of
[1:17:57] people end up leaving. They believe
[1:17:59] brother Brandon was infallible. And if
[1:18:02] they find one little error, one little
[1:18:04] mistake or something, not on the
[1:18:05] ministering of the word, but something
[1:18:07] like this, which I'm getting ready to
[1:18:08] read, they just leave. Amen.
[1:18:13] They leave because they placed him in
[1:18:15] that pos that impossible position of
[1:18:18] never doing anything wrong.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; But look what he says here. He says, "We
[1:18:22] believe that first Corinthians 12, but
[1:18:25] there are five gifts as ordained of God
[1:18:27] for the church and body gifts." What uh
[1:18:30] what is the first is apostle. Well,
[1:18:33] that's not in 1 Corinthians 12.
[1:18:36] We just read that's in Ephesians 4. The
[1:18:38] ministry is he was talking about the
[1:18:41] other gifts of the speaking in tongues
[1:18:44] and prophecy and things like that. those
[1:18:46] other gifts. But this when he's talking
[1:18:49] about this five-fold ministry, the five
[1:18:51] gifts ordained of God for the church,
[1:18:54] the body gifts ordained for the church,
[1:18:57] it's a so it's a so it's a gift. Amen.
[1:19:01] Uh the five-fold ministry is a gift to
[1:19:03] the church to the people,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; right? What is the first apostles and
[1:19:08] that is not really in in our day he
[1:19:10] talks about missionary again because
[1:19:12] apostle missionary is very same word
[1:19:14] missionary means sent one sent
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:19:18] evangelists five gifts now man cannot be
[1:19:22] an apostle because just because he wants
[1:19:25] TO BE
[1:19:27] GOD SETS those in the church
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; he cannot be just because he wants to he
[1:19:34] cannot be a pastor just cuz he wants to,
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:19:41] Well, this is this is out where anybody
[1:19:44] can see it, but I won't call names, but
[1:19:51] you can use if if you have enough of
[1:19:54] God, you can usually tell if you've
[1:19:56] heard a person minister enough, you can
[1:19:59] tell. You can usually tell, especially
[1:20:01] if they're like an evangelist or a
[1:20:03] pastor or a teacher or a pastor or an
[1:20:05] evangelist. Amen. Normally, you can tell
[1:20:08] because if if there's a ministry there,
[1:20:12] it's going to orchestrate itself through
[1:20:14] their life and you'll be able to see it,
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to recognize because the
[1:20:18] the the characteristics are undeniable.
[1:20:21] The characteristics of an evangelist are
[1:20:24] are so far different. Now, for a pastor
[1:20:27] and a teacher, the characteristics can
[1:20:29] be fairly similar. Amen. But you'll see
[1:20:33] that teacher doing a lot more in the in
[1:20:35] the vein of teaching really rather than
[1:20:39] pastoring to people. Amen. Being a
[1:20:41] pastor to people like a shepherd would
[1:20:44] to his flock. Amen. Which uh a lot of
[1:20:47] times see a teach a teacher is not
[1:20:50] gifted to do that. Amen. evangelists.
[1:20:53] You can see a lot of times evangelists
[1:20:55] how their ministry goes and all. I I
[1:20:57] know a couple in town right now that are
[1:20:59] pastoring churches that are evangelist.
[1:21:01] I'll just say it. Uh I know uh back in
[1:21:05] North Carolina, there was a a pastor
[1:21:07] that lost his church. He had quite a
[1:21:09] large church. Uh lost his church and
[1:21:12] started going to a different church. Um,
[1:21:15] and because that church voted him out
[1:21:17] and they voted in a person who was an
[1:21:20] evangelist and eventually that church
[1:21:22] dwindled down to where there was hardly
[1:21:24] anybody there and basically I don't even
[1:21:25] think it's open today.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; That evangelist and he was like 2 250
[1:21:30] people. That evangelist basically
[1:21:32] destroyed that church,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Because evangelist is not gifted,
[1:21:36] especially over a period of time like
[1:21:38] that is not gifted to be able to pastor
[1:21:41] a church to pastor people. He's not
[1:21:43] gifted. That's not his position. Amen.
[1:21:46] Eventually, again, like I said, that if
[1:21:49] that church is still open, there's
[1:21:50] probably two people in it. It just the
[1:21:53] church just whittleled down. It was is
[1:21:54] nothing anymore. Amen. And then, of
[1:21:57] course, there was a time there where
[1:21:59] there started to be let in ministry that
[1:22:02] was contrary to the message, that was
[1:22:04] contrary to the scripture, and things
[1:22:07] that were uh from things that I've
[1:22:09] heard. Now, I'll just say this as
[1:22:10] hearsay. Not that I heard it was just
[1:22:14] really filthy. It just not
[1:22:18] disgusting things to try to say about
[1:22:20] the word. Uh and then all that just just
[1:22:23] destroyed it. Just destroyed it. See?
[1:22:25] So, it's got to be in it. It's got to be
[1:22:27] in its place. See, no man see brother
[1:22:30] said, "Now, a man cannot be an apostle
[1:22:33] just because he wants to be."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:36] And again, I'll add, he can't be a
[1:22:38] pastor just because he wants to be,
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; He can't be an evangelist just because
[1:22:44] he wants to be. He can't be a prophet
[1:22:47] just because he wants to be. [snorts]
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You've got to be. You have to be. God
[1:22:52] sets those in the church. And he cannot
[1:22:56] be a prophet just because he wants to
[1:22:58] be.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be God called, God
[1:23:03] ordained. It's God called and God
[1:23:05] ordained, God backs it up.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that it has to be. Not a lot
[1:23:11] of people get the misnomer that because
[1:23:13] there's hundreds of people there, it's
[1:23:15] successful. That that doesn't mean
[1:23:17] anything at all. If that's true, then if
[1:23:19] you need to go check out Joel Ostein's
[1:23:21] church where he fills up a whole
[1:23:22] basketball arena three times on Sunday
[1:23:26] and all he talks about is how beautiful
[1:23:27] the grass is and how blue the sky is.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; There's nothing scriptural about it.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I listen to him. It's just it's
[1:23:35] just hyperbole. It's just something to
[1:23:37] try to He must have some kind of
[1:23:39] psychology degree or something to just
[1:23:41] try to make you feel good.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; When you go out of there and and and of
[1:23:45] course want to make you open your wallet
[1:23:47] to him, too. But that's uh that's
[1:23:49] another story. But you can't you can't
[1:23:52] go by that.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said, "I'd rather be
[1:23:55] preaching the word and sit on the corner
[1:23:56] with drinking branch water and eating
[1:23:59] soda crackers and have the word."
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. and have thousands of people.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people get those eyes on that
[1:24:07] doesn't mean success at all.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't mean success at all. What
[1:24:11] means success is do you see God in your
[1:24:14] life?
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Do you see God moving in your life?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see God moving in your church? Do
[1:24:19] you see God moving in in in in the
[1:24:22] church services?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is God present? Do you feel it? Do
[1:24:26] you know he's there? Amen. When when you
[1:24:29] know that's true and you can look at the
[1:24:30] word and say, you know,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; that message is right on the word. My
[1:24:35] pastor is right on that message and then
[1:24:38] you know that God God is with you.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what makes all the
[1:24:42] difference in the world. When God is
[1:24:44] with you, God, an apostle missionary is
[1:24:46] one who is sent. One who is sent. Look
[1:24:49] what uh Paul said here.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Galatians 1:1.
[1:24:56] If you want to turn, very simple, easy
[1:24:59] scripture we know of that Paul
[1:25:01] [clears throat] says several times. I
[1:25:03] just picked this one. But look what he
[1:25:04] said here now on the vein that we just
[1:25:06] read.
[1:25:08] Paul an apostle
[1:25:11] calling himself Paul an apostle.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; But look what he said now. He said,
[1:25:16] [clears throat]
[1:25:16] "Not of men,
[1:25:19] neither by man,
[1:25:21] but by Jesus Christ and God the Father
[1:25:24] who raised him from the dead." Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Paul is an apostle. He's declaring to
[1:25:29] the Galatian church. Paul's an apostle,
[1:25:32] BUT HE'S NOT APOSTLE OF MAN. He's not a
[1:25:35] man. He's not an apostle that was sent
[1:25:37] by man. He was He's an apostle that was
[1:25:41] sent by Jesus Christ.
[1:25:44] I'm here because of him, not because I
[1:25:46] want to be. Amen. And you look at the
[1:25:49] things an apostle has to go through. You
[1:25:52] look at a thing that that the apostle
[1:25:53] apostle more than anybody probably an
[1:25:57] apostle spends time away from home, away
[1:26:00] from his wife, away from his children.
[1:26:02] An apostle, excuse me, apostle spend
[1:26:04] more time usually out of his home than
[1:26:08] any other because he'll go for a month
[1:26:10] or so at a time in another country or
[1:26:12] something like that. May be gone for
[1:26:13] months at a time cuz he's supposed to be
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; He's supposed to be gone. He's supposed
[1:26:18] to be out there, not not at home. just
[1:26:21] sitting and uh whatever it is, he's
[1:26:25] supposed to be out there. He's supposed
[1:26:26] to be gone. Now, I will say that
[1:26:30] the necess the necessity of an apostle
[1:26:32] today has lessened somewhat. Um I I want
[1:26:36] to
[1:26:39] I'm it's getting so late on me. I'm
[1:26:41] sorry. Um but there's so much of this.
[1:26:44] It just ties in together. I'll close
[1:26:46] here shortly. I can't see the clock
[1:26:48] without my glasses. Anyway, uh
[1:26:50] Revelation 3, you look in Revelation 3
[1:26:53] and you see the church ages. Uh well,
[1:26:56] you see it in Revelation 2 and three,
[1:26:58] but in three, the about the seventh
[1:27:01] verse, it gets us to uh the Philadelphia
[1:27:05] church age. And when we get to the
[1:27:07] Philadelphia church age, this is what
[1:27:09] Jesus said. unto the angel of the church
[1:27:11] in Philadelphia, write these things
[1:27:13] saith uh saith he that is holy, he that
[1:27:17] is true, he that hath the key of David,
[1:27:20] he that openeth and no man shutth and
[1:27:23] shutth and no man openeth. Now look what
[1:27:24] he says in the eth verse, Revelation
[1:27:27] 3:8. I know thy works,
[1:27:31] and have set before thee an open door,
[1:27:35] and no man can shut it. Now,
[1:27:39] what was that open door in the
[1:27:41] Philadelphia church age? The [snorts]
[1:27:43] Philadelphia church age opened a door.
[1:27:46] And this door, Brother Vanom describes
[1:27:49] to us, this door was the opening of the
[1:27:52] missionary age.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; The this open door was the opening of an
[1:27:57] apostle age of a missionary age where
[1:28:00] people were to go. Now remember this
[1:28:03] country wasn't established until n well
[1:28:05] there was people here in the 1600s as
[1:28:07] far as Englishmen as Native Americans
[1:28:10] here I I don't know if they know how far
[1:28:12] back the Native American goes but
[1:28:14] they've been here when when the English
[1:28:16] man got here 1600 first Thanksgiving we
[1:28:19] have was 1621 so uh but wasn't
[1:28:22] established in se until 1776.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. in 1776 declaring our independence
[1:28:29] from England uh we became a nation
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; right
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; but before that time you recognize and
[1:28:35] see the Philadelphia church age and the
[1:28:38] time frame that it falls in was that
[1:28:40] time where this country started uh
[1:28:42] developing and started getting into its
[1:28:45] independence into its uh uh its own
[1:28:49] nation and so missionaries were coming
[1:28:52] over here they were going all over is
[1:28:53] that open door that sent them all over
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:56] One reason that made John Wesley, in my
[1:28:59] opinion, one reason that made John
[1:29:01] Wesley the messenger for that age.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; John Wesley was one that was made the
[1:29:07] messenger for that age because him and
[1:29:09] his brother just tore this United States
[1:29:11] up, going up one side and down the
[1:29:13] other. Now, not on the west coast, but
[1:29:15] on the east coast going up and down. And
[1:29:17] of course, the mode of transportation
[1:29:19] then was by horse,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; There was no car, there was no jets,
[1:29:22] there was no plane. It's not like they
[1:29:24] could fly and preach a sermon and leave
[1:29:26] town. When they went, they set up camp
[1:29:29] and they went as missionaries as work.
[1:29:31] And I believe because John Wesley was in
[1:29:34] that vein of being a missionary, that
[1:29:36] was he was because he was so he was
[1:29:38] called to be that messenger for that
[1:29:41] age,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; For that Philadelphia church age, it was
[1:29:44] told. Now, I'll read you some of the
[1:29:47] statistics I found. The Philadelphia as
[1:29:49] we said the Philadelphia church age u
[1:29:53] was from 1750 to 1906 as brother
[1:29:56] Brandham has it when our church age
[1:29:57] book. Amen. So as I said just now I
[1:30:00] forgot I had written this written this
[1:30:01] down but it started in 1750. Well, this
[1:30:05] country was birthed as we say in 1776.
[1:30:09] But these men like John Wesley, Charles
[1:30:11] Wesley during the during the
[1:30:13] enlightenment and the reformation, you
[1:30:15] had uh brothers like John and Wes uh
[1:30:18] John and Charles, his brother Wesley,
[1:30:20] George Whitfield, Charles Spurgeon,
[1:30:22] Dwight Moody. All these were come along
[1:30:24] as missionaries, as apostles to spread
[1:30:28] that gospel, to be ones, the first ones
[1:30:30] to go into an area and to start
[1:30:33] ministering the gospel and for a church
[1:30:35] to be established and for there to be
[1:30:36] growth in there of the gospel for people
[1:30:40] to learn the gospel. It was said, as I
[1:30:42] look some statistics up, John uh John
[1:30:45] Wesley
[1:30:47] uh John and Charles Wesley, it was said
[1:30:49] John Wesley wrote a quarter of a million
[1:30:54] miles
[1:30:56] and preached 400 or 40,000
[1:31:00] sermons.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; He rode on a horseback
[1:31:05] a quarter of a million miles.
[1:31:09] I thought, brother Green, flying three,
[1:31:10] four million was a lot. You get on the
[1:31:13] back of a horse and ride 250,000 miles
[1:31:17] and come talk to me about it. See how
[1:31:18] you feel. I'm not riding with you,
[1:31:21] that's for sure. I've ridden a horse. I
[1:31:23] like riding a horse. Mile or two maybe,
[1:31:24] but after that I'm done. 250,000
[1:31:28] miles. Now, of course, that was their
[1:31:29] mode of transportation then, so they
[1:31:31] were more used to it. But 250,000 miles.
[1:31:34] Now, he lived from 1703 to 1791.
[1:31:38] So during that period of time when he
[1:31:40] got to the age that he was called to
[1:31:42] this till uh he was not able to do it
[1:31:44] anymore. So uh you look at 80 uh 88
[1:31:48] years minus whatever time you got there
[1:31:51] 40,000
[1:31:53] sermons.
[1:31:55] 40 thou you know I did the math on that
[1:31:57] some one time and I forgot where I put
[1:31:59] it. Amen. 40 It's like uh I think I if I
[1:32:04] remember right it was like seven sermons
[1:32:06] a week on average. If you averaged it
[1:32:09] out over 50 years or something, the
[1:32:11] active years a person would minister, it
[1:32:13] was like seven message, seven uh uh
[1:32:16] ministry, seven messages a week for 50
[1:32:20] years on average.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; No, that's that open door,
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's that Philadelphia church age.
[1:32:31] That was that missionary time where they
[1:32:33] went out and they went to establish.
[1:32:35] Now, it it may have been he may have
[1:32:38] rode into the middle of nobody town with
[1:32:41] six people and started preaching.
[1:32:45] He didn't have he didn't necessarily
[1:32:47] have churches like this to come into and
[1:32:49] say, "Hey, you know, brother, I feel led
[1:32:52] of the Lord." No, he just rode on his
[1:32:54] word. The Lord led him sent him to a
[1:32:56] place he'd set up camp, start preaching,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody invited him in their
[1:33:01] church or in their home or something.
[1:33:02] Maybe they didn't. But 40,000 sermons in
[1:33:07] his lifetime, that's a lot. Quarter of a
[1:33:10] million miles he wrote. But that was
[1:33:11] that Philadelphia church age. [snorts]
[1:33:13] Amen. That age of of the missionary age
[1:33:16] that we know is called the missionary
[1:33:19] age. Amen. Had to be someone, as we
[1:33:22] said, apostle has to be someone that is
[1:33:24] good at starting things. Yes. I got that
[1:33:27] from brother Green because it's true.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He told me that and then he got up
[1:33:35] behind the pull pit and said that about
[1:33:36] himself.
[1:33:38] Put two and two together. I don't know.
[1:33:40] People criticized me for it, but it's
[1:33:41] the truth anyway. Amen. I feel freer to
[1:33:44] say it now. He's gone. And me and but me
[1:33:46] and brother Green had these
[1:33:47] conversations in private just the two of
[1:33:49] us several times about that. And anyway,
[1:33:54] uh apostles, as we said, are
[1:33:56] foundational preachers. Uh they'll
[1:33:58] they'll the the apostle comes in to set
[1:34:00] up. They come in and preach a a a simple
[1:34:04] message, maybe a message of baptism and
[1:34:06] a message of uh of of giving and a
[1:34:09] message of uh sal just a salvation
[1:34:12] messages and things to set up that
[1:34:14] foundation of faith. See, because a real
[1:34:17] apostle will set that foundation again,
[1:34:19] like I said, where a building can be
[1:34:21] built upon it. He's not there to build
[1:34:23] the building. He's there to lay the
[1:34:25] foundation,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; right? So that God sends other ministers
[1:34:28] in to be able to evangelists and pastors
[1:34:32] and teachers to to bring that to build
[1:34:34] that church up to where it grows in
[1:34:37] grace.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the whole point. But he's
[1:34:40] there. That's the one that's the
[1:34:41] foundation to get it all started. They
[1:34:44] introduce doctrine, but they don't teach
[1:34:47] doctrine.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. They'll they'll a a godly called
[1:34:51] man, a minister will will introduce
[1:34:53] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ. Amen. He won't necessarily
[1:34:58] baptize anybody because somebody will
[1:35:00] come in behind him and do that,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; The pastor or something, they'll do
[1:35:03] that.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; But he'll set that foundation,
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of of a foundational be baptized
[1:35:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:35:11] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. will set that foundation, that
[1:35:15] foundation of faith, and others will
[1:35:17] come in and build on that. Amen.
[1:35:20] Missionaries have to go through a lot.
[1:35:22] Missionaries, uh, I think I got a quote
[1:35:24] in here one time, brother said here that
[1:35:27] I want to say that the greatest calling
[1:35:28] there is on earth in my opinion is the
[1:35:30] mission fields.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; He says that, amen, one who is sent. Now
[1:35:35] again, I as we are gleaning in this age,
[1:35:39] I believe that has waned a bit. I I
[1:35:42] don't necessarily believe that's uh to
[1:35:44] the degree that it used to be. Uh I
[1:35:47] still think there's an importance there.
[1:35:49] But there has been so much of this
[1:35:51] gospel and so much of this message all
[1:35:53] over the world now. There's churches uh
[1:35:56] I forgot how many millions of people now
[1:35:59] according to the voice of God recordings
[1:36:01] that claim that this is that they
[1:36:03] believe the message. They they live the
[1:36:05] message that that is their u u uh that's
[1:36:10] their spiritual enlightenment is the
[1:36:12] message
[1:36:14] around the world. The church is all over
[1:36:15] the world now. So, an apostle to go in
[1:36:18] somewhere and set up something is
[1:36:22] usually not is really not normally
[1:36:25] viable too much today because you get
[1:36:27] you again you you get a church and you
[1:36:30] set a church up in a place in India and
[1:36:33] and that church gets established and
[1:36:35] ministers get raised up in there. Then
[1:36:37] this minister will get to the place to
[1:36:39] where he goes off. Amen. and he starts a
[1:36:42] work over here. And another minister
[1:36:45] will come and he he starts a work over
[1:36:47] here. And someone out of this church
[1:36:49] will raise men up in this church and
[1:36:51] he'll come and start a work over here.
[1:36:53] And see all those all those churches
[1:36:55] start getting established all all over
[1:36:58] the place as a result of that one
[1:37:00] satellite church, right?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; That one place that was there that set
[1:37:04] it up.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; At at one time there was one message
[1:37:07] church in this city, Tucson Tabernacle.
[1:37:10] How many are there now?
[1:37:11] 15,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; something like that.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; probably twice as many as there should
[1:37:16] be, but something like that. I think I
[1:37:19] counted one time. There's several.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Uh, now just in Tucson, Arizona.
[1:37:25] How many was there in 1965? One.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; So, you see each one come out. I was
[1:37:32] with my pastor uh in North Carolina for
[1:37:35] 10 years. I sat in his ministry for 10
[1:37:38] years. Uh uh what long after I started
[1:37:41] the Lord put me in the ministry. I
[1:37:43] ministered there for about six years and
[1:37:45] after about six years the Lord spoke to
[1:37:47] me because I got real diligent about
[1:37:49] Lord what is the calling you put in my
[1:37:51] life? What are you what part of the
[1:37:53] ministry do you want me to fulfill? And
[1:37:54] I felt the Lord spoke to me and told me
[1:37:56] he wanted me to be a pastor. So I went
[1:37:58] to my pastor and I told him I said uh I
[1:38:02] I I'd like to be used here more because
[1:38:04] I believe God's called me to be a
[1:38:05] pastor. that's a part of the ministry I
[1:38:07] believe the Lord's put me in and I'm not
[1:38:09] going to be actively seeking to go out
[1:38:11] evangelize or do any missionary work
[1:38:13] because that's not my calling. I told
[1:38:15] him that. I said, "I'll stay. I'll be at
[1:38:17] home most time now. If somebody calls
[1:38:19] me, I feel led to go, I'll go, but this
[1:38:22] is my call." And he said, "Okay, that
[1:38:24] sounds sounds fine to me." About four
[1:38:26] years later, the Lord gave me a church,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; opened the doors, and I started
[1:38:29] pastoring,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's just the way God does things.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; It it's it it's just the way God works.
[1:38:38] Now, let me finish. But see, I let me
[1:38:41] finish this thought. I'll close.
[1:38:44] But missionaries endure a lot. Amen.
[1:38:47] First of all, there's a lot of
[1:38:48] uncertainty in some cases if you're a
[1:38:50] true missionary, especially in the day
[1:38:53] where you're going into the jungles of
[1:38:55] places where there's no churches and no
[1:38:57] establishment of the message or
[1:38:58] anything. But brother Ram says, "Now in
[1:39:00] Africa,
[1:39:02] he said, in Africa, I would eat when
[1:39:04] they just," he said, and then he said,
[1:39:07] "I don't see how in the world I could
[1:39:10] have done it."
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, what he's talking
[1:39:12] about is he had to eat things that he
[1:39:15] wouldn't normally eat. He had to eat
[1:39:18] things that probably uh was not very
[1:39:23] pleasing to eat.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; U and you know the uh food the diet that
[1:39:31] some uh some country staple diet is
[1:39:35] bugs.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the only bug I ever read is if
[1:39:39] it accidentally flies in my mouth.
[1:39:43] And it's not chocolate covered or
[1:39:44] anything either. It's just straight in.
[1:39:47] So, but there the staple of some of
[1:39:49] them. So,
[1:39:52] you you've got to be in the position. I
[1:39:54] mean, Brother Null's come in here and
[1:39:55] told us about some of the things that
[1:39:57] they've had to eat. And
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; uh I I I I've had other brothers I've
[1:40:01] talked to that when they went to a
[1:40:04] missionary place, boy, I'm getting late.
[1:40:06] uh they've gone to a place he said
[1:40:08] they've had they've had to scrape the
[1:40:09] maggots off just to slice a piece off
[1:40:11] for them to eat
[1:40:13] but you eat it. That's what brother
[1:40:15] Brown said. He said I don't see how in
[1:40:17] the world I could have ate it. He said
[1:40:19] God just had to help me. That is all.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; I've had him I I've had him tell me uh I
[1:40:25] think maybe this is brother cross said
[1:40:27] that they went and this is India built
[1:40:30] they had to go boil it. They they take
[1:40:32] water out of the stream. It just looks
[1:40:33] like good water. Just take it out of
[1:40:35] string, set it on a fire, and boil it.
[1:40:37] And after it boils about five minutes,
[1:40:39] the whole thing turns white cuz all them
[1:40:42] meebas and the maggots and stuff that
[1:40:45] that the heat killed. And they all died
[1:40:48] bloated and floated to the top. They had
[1:40:51] to scrape all that off and all just to
[1:40:52] try to have some decent water. He said,
[1:40:54] "And then it wasn't safe. Not for people
[1:40:56] who aren't used to it."
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; But then they could drink it. See, they
[1:41:00] give usually if you go over there now,
[1:41:02] they give you bottle water or something
[1:41:03] you can drink because our system can't
[1:41:05] take something like that. But those
[1:41:07] people, he said he would see them drink
[1:41:08] that after they skimmed all the maggots
[1:41:12] and stuff off of it, all the amoeba,
[1:41:13] they skim all that off. They would drink
[1:41:15] that water. They were used to it. Their
[1:41:17] system, their body, they could take it.
[1:41:19] See, but if you're a missionary and go
[1:41:22] do you, you can't just go over there for
[1:41:24] a month and say, "No thank you. No thank
[1:41:26] you. No thank you." You've got to eat.
[1:41:29] You've got to eventually at some point
[1:41:30] in time eat. Now, I think I've heard
[1:41:32] it's gotten a little bit better when
[1:41:33] you're in more of an established city
[1:41:36] where you could have more food like
[1:41:37] we're used to eating. But if you go out
[1:41:39] in places where they just live off the
[1:41:41] land and stuff, you just you just eat
[1:41:43] with them. You you eat where they eat,
[1:41:45] you sleep where they sleep. Remember why
[1:41:47] brother Brandham, brother Green told us
[1:41:49] that uh in India they didn't give you
[1:41:51] the they didn't shake I think it was
[1:41:52] India, they didn't shake your right hand
[1:41:54] or Burma, something like that. You know
[1:41:56] in this country you go and for
[1:41:58] fellowship you go shake somebody's right
[1:42:00] hand they shake your right hand they
[1:42:02] don't do that over there I don't I don't
[1:42:04] remember if it was India Burma somewhere
[1:42:06] they don't shake you if you go in and
[1:42:07] shake your right hand they won't shake
[1:42:08] your right hand they'll put their left
[1:42:10] hand out say well the Bible says right
[1:42:12] hand of fellowship and now don't be
[1:42:13] approved about it because listen those
[1:42:16] people just go and squat over a hole and
[1:42:18] they wipe themselves with their right
[1:42:20] hand
[1:42:22] now do you want to shake their right
[1:42:23] hand
[1:42:25] you know Maybe the right hand of
[1:42:27] fellowship's not so good right now. I
[1:42:28] think I'll take the left. That's what
[1:42:30] they do. They would squat over hold and
[1:42:32] they would clean themselves with their
[1:42:34] right hand.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; That's why they don't shake with their
[1:42:37] right hand.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Being a missionary, a lot of people
[1:42:41] think, but if you're a missionary, it's
[1:42:43] it's your calling. It's in your blood.
[1:42:45] It's what you want to do,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I imagine you can't hardly see a
[1:42:48] plane fly over your head without wishing
[1:42:49] that you were going to someplace to help
[1:42:52] people or to be there for them. He said,
[1:42:55] "God just helped me." That was all. But
[1:42:58] if you have to do it anyhow, you see,
[1:42:59] and so people who missionary, he said,
[1:43:02] go through a lot of unpleasant things.
[1:43:05] And that's true.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; But the good part of it is, as I close
[1:43:09] here, good part of it is if you're God
[1:43:12] called, God blesses you in that.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; You don't seek that out. You don't want
[1:43:17] to do that. If if you're if if you call
[1:43:21] yourself a missionary and you fly into
[1:43:22] the main city and you stay at the Hilton
[1:43:24] and uh that that's that's not a
[1:43:26] missionary. A missionary gets out and
[1:43:28] goes into the jungles and and lives
[1:43:30] where the people live and eat where the
[1:43:32] people eat and minister to them in their
[1:43:34] primitive whatever. No matter how hot it
[1:43:36] is or how cold it is or if it's raining
[1:43:38] or it doesn't matter, but God ordains
[1:43:42] you to do that. God anoints you to do
[1:43:44] that. God blesses you to do that. And
[1:43:47] when he's there, it just it makes
[1:43:49] everything. It's like the dark ages.
[1:43:52] People would talk about how horrible the
[1:43:53] dark ages were, and they were absolutely
[1:43:56] horrendous that humans could do those
[1:43:58] things to another to other humans. But
[1:44:00] those people had an anointing.
[1:44:03] They were anointed to do that.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. I
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; I personally believe when they lit that
[1:44:08] fire to burn them at the stake, they
[1:44:09] didn't feel a thing,
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe the smell of smoke or something. I
[1:44:12] don't But God was there.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; God was with them. Amen. And when God
[1:44:17] takes care of it, he can take just like
[1:44:19] he did Shadrach, Meshack, and Abedneo,
[1:44:21] he can take the fire out of the fiery
[1:44:23] furnace.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He can take the heat out of the fire.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can come forth out of that
[1:44:29] furnace without even a smell of smoke on
[1:44:31] you.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Because God's with you.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That's why the witness was, I see a
[1:44:35] fourth man walking around looks like the
[1:44:36] son of God.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when God's with you. It
[1:44:40] sounds disgusting to us. Amen. But they
[1:44:44] live that way. And that's the way and
[1:44:47] and they have to be built for that. They
[1:44:48] are built for that.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I'm gonna I thought I
[1:44:54] would just extend this, but I'm going to
[1:44:56] close it. Uh we've we've gotten the
[1:44:58] apostle, but I do want to read one more
[1:45:00] scripture before I close. 2 Corinthians
[1:45:03] 11:13
[1:45:04] just kind of solidify what we have been
[1:45:07] talking here. For such are false
[1:45:09] prophets,
[1:45:10] deceitful [clears throat]
[1:45:11] workers,
[1:45:13] transforming themselves into the
[1:45:16] apostles of Christ, transforming
[1:45:19] themselves. Amen. To make a scheme out
[1:45:22] of it, to make them look like something
[1:45:24] they're not. See, [snorts]
[1:45:26] and no marvel
[1:45:29] base, don't don't let this surprise you.
[1:45:31] For Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:45:34] angel of light.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. as a lightbearer. He was
[1:45:39] transformed himself into an angel of
[1:45:41] light. Therefore, it is no great thing
[1:45:44] that his ministers. Now, what his is
[1:45:47] this? This is not a god his. This is a
[1:45:50] devil. His
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. His ministers, Satan's ministers,
[1:45:56] there's no great thing that Satan's
[1:45:58] ministers also be transformed as the
[1:46:02] ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:46:03] shall be according to their works.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. according to their works. So we
[1:46:08] know where they end up
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; because the word tells us,
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; The devil, false prophet, beast, all its
[1:46:18] followers end up cast into the lake of
[1:46:20] fire.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's no wonder that Satan who
[1:46:28] himself transform into a angel of light
[1:46:31] would have his minister, Satan's
[1:46:34] ministers.
[1:46:35] Amen. Trying to preach the word, not
[1:46:39] God, not called, not of God, not
[1:46:42] ordained of God, but try to preach, what
[1:46:45] do they do? It's a detriment to people.
[1:46:48] It's harmful to people. It hurts them.
[1:46:50] Now, but remember now, the good part
[1:46:52] about that is the bride cannot be
[1:46:55] deceived.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride, she cannot be deceived.
[1:47:00] If it's not being done, she'll find some
[1:47:02] place that is. She'll go where God sends
[1:47:04] her. Amen.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Let's start. Let's stand if we could.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Our apostles, missionaries.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Great men of God. Appreciate them so
[1:47:17] much.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Appreciate
[1:47:20] I appreciated Brother Green so much. A
[1:47:22] lot of people
[1:47:24] had issues. I love Brother Green so
[1:47:27] much.
[1:47:28] didn't do so much of it in the latter
[1:47:30] parts of his ministry, but he was but he
[1:47:34] was God called to do what he did. Amen.
[1:47:37] And I I I appreciated and respected that
[1:47:40] so very much. Amen.
[1:47:43] Because God's the one that did it and I
[1:47:46] trust the Lord. The Lord takes care of
[1:47:48] it. Even if it doesn't make any sense or
[1:47:51] even if it doesn't fit with what you
[1:47:53] think, right?
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's the one that's in charge of
[1:47:56] it.
[1:47:58] Amen.
[1:48:01] Praise the Lord. Trying to find this.
[1:48:06] [snorts]
[1:48:09] Amen.
[1:48:11] Most of this by myself.
[1:48:14] I can't remember the name of this song.
[1:48:18] I don't want to start it because if I if
[1:48:20] I do, I'll I might forget parts of it.
[1:48:23] Amen. Does anybody know that the name of
[1:48:24] that song? When the cold of fire had
[1:48:27] touched the prophets,
[1:48:30] making him as pure can be
[1:48:37] when the voice of God said, "He'll go
[1:48:39] for
[1:48:47] speak."
[1:48:50] Amen.
[1:48:53] Speak my Lord.
[1:48:55] 92 won't be on the screen here. So 92.
[1:49:01] Amen. I don't know the verses, but I
[1:49:03] like the like I like the chorus.
[1:49:06] Um
[1:49:08] the uh the first verse anyway. Do you
[1:49:11] know that?
[1:49:14] Or I guess the one I just sang was the
[1:49:15] second verse. [clears throat]
[1:49:19] [snorts] Amen.
[1:49:22] Let's sing the first verse if we could.
[1:49:24] 2.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly
[1:49:29] calling.
[1:49:31] Who will go and work for me today?
[1:49:36] Who will bring to me the [singing] lost
[1:49:39] and dying?
[1:49:42] Who will point to them the narrow way?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord.
[1:49:52] Speak [singing]
[1:49:53] my Lord.
[1:49:55] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[1:50:00] [singing]

[1:50:06] Speak [singing] my Lord.
[1:50:10] Speak and I will answer. [singing]
[1:50:15] Lord, send me.
[1:50:20] When the coal of fire had touched the
[1:50:24] prophet,
[1:50:27] making him as pure as pure can be
[1:50:33] when the voice of God so he'll go for
[1:50:37] us.
[1:50:40] Then he answered, "Here am I. [singing]
[1:50:44] Send me."
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord. [singing]
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord.
[1:50:55] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.

[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Speak and I will answer.
[1:51:16] Lord send me.
[1:51:20] [singing]
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Millions now in sin and shame are dying.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to their sad and bitter cry.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Hasten brother. hasten to their rescue.
[1:51:43] Quickly answer, [singing] "Master,
[1:51:47] here am I.
[1:51:51] Speak my Lord.
[1:51:55] Speak my Lord. [singing]
[1:51:59] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[1:52:04] [singing]
[1:52:07] Speak my Lord.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord. [singing]
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Speak and I will answer.

[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, send me. Amen. You might not be a
[1:52:34] part of the five-fold apostle, prophet,
[1:52:36] teacher, but you're a minister of God
[1:52:38] everywhere you go.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let others hear you, see you,
[1:52:44] recognize there's something about you
[1:52:46] that is different.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you belong to God.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Born again, full of his spirit.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Disciple of his.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you today. I
[1:52:59] pray something was said to bless and

[1:53:05] like a few people did log on. So, praise
[1:53:08] the Lord. God bless you. God bless each
[1:53:10] one of you. Now, remember, uh next week,

[1:53:15] the next week out of town. Uh so, next
[1:53:18] Sunday, I'll have to text you and let
[1:53:20] you know for sure what time service will
[1:53:21] be. Um, I I can't even usually I can
[1:53:26] kind of speculate by what's going on in
[1:53:29] the jobs, but the way they are right

[1:54:01] maybe text to just to make sure people
[1:54:04] to remind people uh some that aren't
[1:54:06] here and didn't hear, but I'll let
[1:54:09] everyone know that you can know that the
[1:54:12] 14th and 21st will not be here. So amen.
[1:54:16] Lord bless you. Amen. Good to see each
[1:54:19] one of you. Does anyone have anything
[1:54:20] before dismiss today?
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. Appreciate each
[1:54:28] one of you coming to be here with us
[1:54:30] today. Let's just bow our heads as we
[1:54:32] pray a word of prayer for you. Brother,
[1:54:34] would you dismiss us?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I feel like what David said
[1:54:40] one time, I was glad when they said unto
[1:54:43] me, let us go to the house of the Lord.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. Lord, your word has come
[1:54:47] forth. It was a spiritual food in due
[1:54:51] season. May you truly uh apply it to our
[1:54:55] hearts. And it's like our pastor just
[1:54:58] said,
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; everyone will be preaching your gospel
[1:55:03] by living your gospel.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And that's what even Paul and brother
[1:55:08] Brown said. The greatest sermon ever
[1:55:11] preached was a live sermon.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. There's people that'll never pick
[1:55:16] up a Bible and the prophet taught us
[1:55:20] that the only Bible they'll ever see is
[1:55:22] the the walking Bible, your life
[1:55:26] presented before them.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to live that life
[1:55:31] continually. We know there's a allseeing
[1:55:34] eye watching us.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we go from this house of
[1:55:39] worship, Lord, may we truly throughout
[1:55:42] the week live that life.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Be ready. Be prayed up. Have that burden
[1:55:49] for the lost. Father, I heard you
[1:55:52] prophesy one time that there was a man
[1:55:54] that left the church. He got away. And
[1:55:59] other people in the church says,
[1:56:00] "Brother Ram, you're wasting your time.
[1:56:02] Don't go after him. He's a renegade.
[1:56:04] He's a troublemaker. And the prophet
[1:56:07] says, "As long there's breath in that
[1:56:10] body."
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; He has a soul that's worth more to God
[1:56:14] than 10 million worlds.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; And he went after him. He brought him
[1:56:18] back to the fold. You used him to bring
[1:56:22] him back
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; to you, Father. Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And may we have that burden. Maybe
[1:56:27] there's someone that you put in our
[1:56:28] hearts that we need to go out and reach
[1:56:30] and and share your gospel while there's
[1:56:34] time. Oh, Father, bless each and
[1:56:37] everyone
[1:56:38] that came this morning.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; May there may they be like the as they
[1:56:44] walk with you on the road of Emmas. May
[1:56:46] our hearts truly burn within us as we
[1:56:50] meet with you along the way, not only in
[1:56:52] church, but all through the week. Father
[1:56:55] bless them. Grant everyone traveling
[1:56:57] mercies to their destinations. Father in
[1:57:00] your name we pray in the name of the
[1:57:03] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you today. Amen.
