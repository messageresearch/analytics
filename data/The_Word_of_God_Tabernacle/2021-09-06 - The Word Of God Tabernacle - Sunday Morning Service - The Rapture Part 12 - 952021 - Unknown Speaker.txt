hashanah is going to be the first it's going to be the evening of rosh hashanah which means first of the new year in the hebrew calendar all the time always look at the jews and it's a time of great coming to the lord yes yes and fasting and and pouring out the heart and sin and it ends in it's called the ten days of law and it ends uh on the tenth day with yom kippur the great day of fasting and and grief for the past sins and just a holy convocation on to the lord and prayer i think it would be nice if we of course were you're supposed to do this every day amen but uh i just wanted to bring that up amen good good good amen amen well i have a testimony anyone else first of all brother dennis absolutely yes um you know personally how the lord just encourages me with the panties i haven't had a panty encounter in months and as i got off the plane i was waiting for leah i looked down there was a penny all right lord it's just an encouragement i know you're with me amen them they're led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god that's right and so the next morning i had put the penny in my pocket and there was another one right by it wow that witness amen and here's a quick testimony as well uh we had gone with some of the family uh to breakfast and leah and i quietly prayed you know with between ourselves and one of the family members says oh wait we'll pray with you we'll be glad to pray with you i am and you know of course you want to have a chance to really you know share the gospel right those doors didn't open but they saw our lives amen that's a testimony i'm so thankful though amen i can minister yeah that's true brother dennis and yeah uh very true that's right uh you don't want to take up a lot of time but i've just witnessed what he's saying he says you're the key to your family being safe yeah they're watching you're that king amen that example exactly right yes but real quick amen uh at brothers rogers last week uh uh of course in uh had a a desire to go a certain place to visit a certain church i wasn't sure you know whether it was god's will or not so um uh it came to me you know put up a fleece you know put a fleece there you know sometimes we're afraid to put a fleece i'll speak for myself uh because we think it ain't gonna happen or it ain't gonna happen that way or something like that but i was thinking well whether it's no or yes you know it's still good it's god's answer you know no word yes amen so i said lord i said well help me to see that number three three three because i see three three a lot i love that number 33. see it a lot you know it reminds me of god amen exactly true and um so i said lord let me see that number 333 that it would show me that this is you talking to me you know you know we know that it's god's will you know we know that that's him yeah you didn't do you have nothing to do with him and then so um and it's okay very well and then that day day before i think it was i said uh um uh got out of the shower you know i said i'm not gonna look for it i'm not gonna look for the next meeting looking for it you know when we just stand still and let god do what he's going to show you amen you know exactly true yeah so um go over there and i said okay you know get out of the shower no 3 39 uh woke up at night no 3 47 in the morning okay uh then the next day went to brother uh rogers and uh i said well i guess it ain't his will you know it's not happened yet and so um then i felt to sing a certain song matter of fact i think it was the one that i said here the week before uh i'd rather have jesus amen and i said okay i like to feel that to do things okay put that down then i'll open up the song but guess what song number one number thirty three three three three that's right wow okay there it is there it is that's really good thank you lord amen yeah and then so and then the next night now listen to this i thought amen exactly amen uh so the next night brother bennett i'm sitting there i'm sleeping right and i wake up you know i don't know if it's age or what you know i wake up can't go back to sleep that way wow so i woke up and i just turned to the clock 333 right when i looked at the clock okay that's good thank you lord i appreciate that next night the next night woke up same time looked at the clock three three three so i like that amen and the mouth of two or three years and everybody raises those stars amen brother exactly it's hard to do that amen all right well amen very good well let us uh stand as we have our pastor come brother bennett when i sing that song 272 uh fill my cup lord [Music] amen just the course we'll just do the course [Music] is [Music] my [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] [Music] one more time [Music] this [Music] feed me [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen you want him to do that today amen ask the lord to fill your cup you know brother branham said if you want more of god there just proves that there's more of god for you yeah amen it's that deep calling to the deep it's a thirst that's in your heart there's got to be a thirst to respond to that as he is our creator as he is our sustainer as we thirst for that there's something there to fill it for us amen so if you desire a full cup when you leave this place today and i pray god grant that to you you will have it amen amen before you leave amen i'm going to look something up real quick because it just came on my heart and like brother john said we'd like to try to obey the lord yes and something came uh came on my heart and when he sang that amazing grace i don't know why it ever struck me maybe just because of what's going on now but it ever struck me the way it did for the second verse and it made me it made me think about a quote that brother zavala had read at brother frank's funeral and if i actually can have reception here i'll try to find this quote if i don't have reception maybe i'm not supposed to find it [Music] but you look at you see that second verse there see the first first part of that second verse it says here we go it says twas grace that taught my heart to fear and it was grace that relieved my fears or graced my fears relieve of course as the poetic verse goes in the in the poem of how they write it but basically it's saying grace relieved my fears amen and you remember that john newton wrote this and under the circumstances that he wrote it i mean he was in fear for his life but it was grace that came into his pathway that relieved his fear and you know as we've said for over a year now fear has just dripped the world and the coveted fears just absolutely ransacked the world today and people are just and and like we read the other day men's hearts failing for fear but i i remember this quote that brother zavala read and um sorry to leave you standing but uh he actually says in a couple of places but i want to read it to you um things that are to be there are several places he says this actually he says but i am glad listen this now listen this you're streaming today things that are to be december 5th 196 about 10 days before brother branham's accident it wasn't 10 days the 15th or 14th anyway it was right 20 days later brother branham's gone brother graham says i'm glad that there's something to get us out of this pest house and people scared to death of dying right of course some people unfortunately in the way they're living their lives they should be scared to die but he said i'm so glad that there's something to get us out of this pest house what a differing view that what you hear from most people today right amen to get us out of this pest house yes there's an open door and it's called death jesus stands in that door amen he'll guide me over the river he'll take me through that door there's a great door standing yonder called death and every time your heart beats you're one beat closer to it and someday listen this grace my fears relieved grace relieved my fears he said in some day i must come to that door you must come to that door but when i come there i don't want to be a coward amen brother says when i come to that door i don't want to be a coward i don't want to come streaming back off he said i want to come to that door and wrap myself in his robe of righteousness amen praise the lord amen that's wonderful brother just off that little leading you had for that song there and the lord's showing me that i could probably just take a whole another sermon but we i've got something else in my heart for today but it is so wonderful that god relieves our fears his grace relieves our fears and brings us someday we're looking for a rapture and we've been preaching on the rapture that we won't taste death but if time would tarry every one of us will come to that door yeah brother ram said i'm so glad that door is there jesus is at that door waiting to receive us i won't have to cross jordan alone amen thank you lord and i don't want to go as a coward right screaming yelling right i just want to say here i am lord wrote wrap me in your robe of righteousness and i might step into your presence and jesus will say enter into the glories of the lord it has been well done my good and faithful servant amen isn't that a wonderful thing why would anybody when you're when you literally know by faith that you're facing that why would anybody be afraid why would anybody be scared of death under those circumstances yes i have to echo his sentiment i'm glad there's something that'll get me out of this pest house amen praise the lord and the older you get the more pesky it seems to you don't realize that maybe when you're younger i didn't realize it when i was younger but the older i get the real the more i realize how rotten and pesty it really is amen but i'm thankful to god that he give us a way of escape amen a way of escape praise the lord now while you're standing i got something else i want to talk about for just a moment but while you're standing let's read the bible i'll let you be seated uh first thessalonians chapter i thought uh brother john did an awesome job amen amen awesome job i love the music uh brother zach and mike i saw him working with each other on the keys and stuff i love that just uh just praise the lord amen praise the lord on the musical instruments amen and brother john used his musical instrument and brother zach and the talent god give him and mike and the talent god give him and amen amen i just just it'd been on my heart for a little while even maybe since country club to uh maybe try to have brother john sing lead songs a little bit more and uh zach played the guitar and now we just get tapped up and play the organ piano thing and we'll be in we'll be good now a good barrister and she's mad at me but anyway i don't care because she has a talent too yes and i i i for one as you probably already know hate to see talent sitting in jesus i like to see it being utilized and for the glory of the lord amen the glory of the lord amen god didn't give us to hide them under a bushel right he gave us we could use them for him so first thessalonians chapter 4 back to the same place we've started the past 11 services the rapture part 12. we're going to start with verse 13 again like we've had the rapture part 12. amen i think we're i was looking at it yesterday and going over some things and it felt like we were kind of nearing it into this but we'll see however the lord leads it but first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. before we read the word again let's just bow our hearts for another word of prayer father god we're certainly grateful of all that you've done for us and given to us today sometimes lord it's just as it struck me when that song and brother john was singing that there lord i don't know how many times i've sang amazing grace i don't know how many times i've been in church and i've led that song or i've sang that song and but for some reason that second verse and what's going on in the world today just spoke to my heart so close and lord we thank you father for that grace that amazing grace that you give in our lives that that rapturing grace that that faith lord that we can have to know god that it was grace that saved us through faith and yes we thank you father that by that grace it relieves our fear because we know by faith that we're yours and may god when it comes time for you to call us home i i just appreciate that quote from brother branham and lord this pest house would give way to your uh celestial body god that you've given us and lord we're looking forward to that day we're looking forward to the time father that that you call us home to be with you but lord while we're here and we are here god and there's a few of us here today lord but those who may be streaming god let us be faithful to the posts as you've given it for us to do while we're here and have breath in our bodies may we take every breath and every heartbeat like brother adam said and use it for your glory and honor somehow some way lord if we could do it god and lord that may be just providing for our families it may be just uh uh giving a witness to somebody it may be just bowing our heads at a dinner table and praying in a restaurant or somewhere lord god it could mean anything but god we want to do it for your glory and honor whatever it is we thank you god for all that you've done for us given to us for this service today for those that have come may you just bless us lord may your spirit move now father in a special powerful supernatural way god as you always do sweet through this place once again god just as you did on the day of pentecost to feel your presence and know you real father if they're streaming today god sweep through their living room sweep to their homes wherever they are god and lord may that power come may every sick body be healed may every downtrodden heart be encouraged may every depressed spirit be uplifted today god may every high place be made low every rough place smooth every curry play straight because you jesus visited us today we rebuke every demonic spirit lord in the name of jesus christ it would try to hurt hinderer infiltrate this service in any way and that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we give you thanks for it now in the random part of the service into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you could be seated if you'd like amen i think it's a a wonderful thing that the testimonies that brother dennis gave and brother john gave you recognize that we all need something like that right amen we all need something like that that witness that the lord gives each one of us individually let us know how much he's mindful of us brother dennis with his pennies and brother john with his numbers and whatever it is it's that identification that god gives to you and however god comes to you and however it is in your life it means something to you to let you know how mindful he is of you everybody amen and that's important it's important for every one of us to to have something like that uh some people may say oh that's carl no it's not no how many times does god use the carnal to vindicate his word amen to vindicate his promises to bring them to pass amen whatever it might be works in the same way in our lives in each one of us so i appreciate those testimonies they meant a lot to me and i thank god for it now last week one of the quotes i read actually the first quote i read and as as the hurricane was lashing at the doors of new orleans last sunday morning i read this quote and it was the first one that the lord gave me last week when i was studying and this quote became so prevalent on my heart all week as i saw what unfolded with the things that took place in the world in this country not in the world just in this country now the world of course and things that's going on around us but in this country i'm going to read this quote again listen it's in the it's in the church age book and the exposition of the church age the laodicean church age and he's talking about of course the exhortation in revelation 3 of god giving to the laodicean church age poor miserable blind wretched naked he said they are miserable that means they are objects to be pity pitied they scorn pity they are full of pride they want what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time in other words they bought what they have but what they have is not worth vaunting right right they boast in what they have but what they have is not worth boasting about right they have built listen this now they have built upon quicksand rather than the rock of the revelation of god's word soon cometh the earthquake soon soon soon there will come the storms of the wrath of god in judgment amen then comes sudden destruction sudden destruction how many uh 60 people or so now i've lost their lives just because of this one hurricane and very few down on the gulf coast it's all in the northeast sudden destruction and in spite of all their carnal preparation they will be they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the earth they are those who in spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and they don't know it now when that when all that happened unfolded this week i'm thinking california's burning to the ground and floods are washing people away in the northeast and of course like i said last week they and we talked about the signs in heaven and earth last week and uh tried to finish that up it helped to see now the things that at this end time of what's unfolding around us and we don't want to be ignorant of those things sister matisse of course talked about the scriptural reference of you want to know what time it is look at israel which is very pertinent of course scriptural also we look at the other things that god gave us that we recognize are signs that we can see unfolding before us israel is the biggest one all the other things that unfolding around us helps us realize man tries to reason it all away but they cannot reason it away they try to explain it they try to prepare themselves for it they try to do everything they can but they're ill-prepared for what's coming because they've trusted in themselves and building upon the sand of their own knowledge instead of the revelation of the rock of god's word and his promises and if you don't build your foundation on the rock of the word of god it will fall every time and it's falling all around us yes now they want to beg trillions of dollars out of you to try to fix this as they call climate change but we talked about that the other day too amen and and the things that's going on and there is climate changing there is things that's happening around the world we know that um uh i i don't trust a lot of the science that goes into it because unfortunately friend and i don't mean to be cynical but uh these people who give these prognostications are people who get billions of dollars in grant money every year from the government right if you don't have that you don't get the money the money drives up so if climate change as they preach it were to go away so with their money hmm well the money's not going to go away because they're not going to quit harping on this and then the next thing you know here comes our leader and it comes out it's climate change and we've got to have three and a half actually probably five trillion dollars to combat all of this they'll be ill-prepared right for what's happening he said coming but what is happening right now things they have no answer to things they cannot do anything about wildfires raging of course in california i don't know of any other place it is and there's nothing they can do about it i mean there's something they can do and god bless those firefighters they're they're doing their best to try to put this thing out and all but what gains are they making you understand these things are happening and and we believe them to be by the hand of god god is allowing these things to happen now some of this stuff happened because of human negligence of course i believe that right the bible says god will destroy those that destroy the world and i know that's happening but the only place of safety is that the ark of the word is in the spirit and and the ark of god's word that's the only safe place there is if you get outside of that that's why brother branham said there at the end he said uh uh in one of those quotes i i think i may have read it last week uh i can't remember uh that brother graham talked about the only safe place of course is is in christ that's the only place you can get in and be safe right it's the only place you can get it hides from the devil to hide from the world um i think it was christ the mystery god revealed he said you know get get away from the world get out of the world get get as far away from the things and the love of the world as you can get into christ the only safe place there is yes now part 12 uh i was going to try to make this a little shorter but um and we'll see because uh uh going to have a little lunch and then drive down to sierra vista this afternoon and brother roger's service starts at 4 30 and it's hour and a half to get there so um let's get to the rapture part 12 now i just i just felt on my heart that was just been burning on my heart since i read this uh since i read this last week last sunday and then what transpired over the over the course of this week with the hurricane the fires and the proclamation of this trillions of dollars and all that i i just felt like you know you can put what's higher than trillions i don't even know you could put a bazillion trillion dollars into it and they'll still be unprepared for what's about to hit this plan yes amen it's just gonna rock and reel and it's just gonna brother adam said even the atmospheres will explode kill every single speck of sin on this planet because we're going to god's people will come back and live here now i want to talk about for a few minutes and a state of enrapturement or being enraptured uh because a lot of times we view the rapture as we should as a singular event that takes place at the culmination of the gentile age the gentile dispensation of gentile bride dispensation because the gentile dispensation will continue on after the rapture brother bam said the laodicea goes on into perdition well the bride leaves long before that but but it for the bride it culminates at that point of a rapture a singular event of a of a mass body change of of god's children around the world to be translated and to go into a rapture to meet the lord in the air that's what we consider that second coming of the lord to be that coming is we go to him we call it a coming but actually we go to him actually in this as we refer to as his second coming we go to him but this enrapturement is something that really is a for a christian this enragement is actually a perpetual existence it is something that a child of god lives in it's where they are it's where they exist a child of god lives in a place of enrapturement every day of their lives amen and i want to show a couple of examples of that and bring some scripture but understanding that we we have already been caught up out of this world the bride has already been caught up out of this cosmos this world the bride has already been caught up out of laodicea into a bride age this uh this bride has already been caught up or enraptured into heavenly places she's already living there she's in a different dimension amen now our bodies are still here our human bodies are still here in this sport in this uh fourth dimension but there's there's a place that uh that that the spirit of man that that that our soul is is enraptured into to a place that uh that you can't see you might not can touch it feel it right but but it's there it exists and it's where the bride lives it's where she lives amen let's read ephesians chapter two uh i'll begin with the first verse ephesians chapter 2. now like i said i usually take a little more liberties because we don't have an evening service but i was trying to hone this one down maybe just a little bit more due to my particular time constraints anyway of uh trying to get a bite to eat and driving down the sierra vista this afternoon so um but uh but i don't want to be disobedient to the lord either amen ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins now we all know what the word quickened means means to be made alive very much amen so we were once dead because we were born in sins shaped iniquity come in the world speaking lines so we were born now this might sound like a paradox but we were born dead we were born dead you say well i was alive uh doctors spanked me i screamed and i was determined to live breath come in my lungs and i'm living today i was alive i always make this uh joke of a lot of times people ask brother roger if he played basketball because you know he's six foot seven and brother rogers no he never played basketball and i always told people when they asked me uh if i'd tell them especially if i was when i was driving uber so from north carolina it's all you like basketball play basketball because you know it's a big basketball hub i said i said of course i played basketball i said when you're born when you're born a male in north carolina the doctor doesn't spank you he gives you a basketball and if you can dribble you're alive that's how they determine whether you're alive as a as a male newborn in north carolina you have to be able to dribble a basketball but we are born again as paradoxical as it may seem we are born dead born in sin iniquity speaking life sin is sin is a perpetual state of death right amen that that is a perpetual state of death sin is death it's sin is separation from god death is separation you live in sin you live dead you're born in sin shape nick become the world speaking lives so we were once dead but god quickened us made us alive so what does that tell us that tells us that those who were quickened those who are made alive which i believe were a part of the rest of the of humanity if you will are living dead now i'm not advocating zombies the living dead but spiritually they are dead while they're yet a living right yes amen they're dead dead in their sins amen dead in their sins god has quickened us now so that in itself shows us that for god's children there's been a change or a a an elevation a a a state of being alive where once we were dead now we are alive so we are living our lives spiritually alive the rest of the world is living their lives spiritually dead so they're dead so this already shows a differentiation between what the world is and how they live and what the bride is in god's children and how they are to what they live and how they live there's a difference amen okay verse two wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so there still are children of disobedience well if there are children of disobedience there are children of obedience amen amen there can't be a children of disobedience unless there's a children of obedience amen amen you wouldn't know that there's light if there was nothing but darkness darts and saint darkness if that's all there is light's not light unless that's all there is is light you understand right so there is no there is no disobedience if there's oh if there's no obedience because everybody's just all the same but because we know there's that spirit that still works in the children of disobedience there is a spirit that works in the children of obedience and it's not the spirit of the devil it's the spirit of christ and his word who has made us alive quickened us to him among whom also we all had our conversation and time passed and the lust of our flesh and don't deny you know we all did fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others our very nature commanded us to lie still cheat that's just how we were born that's who we were that's how we lived our lives our very nature we just did what we were born to do right as we were born amen amen natural brute beasts fourth verse but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved now look at this even when we were that is past tense amen which means you're no longer dead you're alive why you've been quickened right you were dead where in sin right so what is sin sin is death when you are living in sin the people the world that live in sin are living in death when we were living we were dead in our sins now we are dead to sin right amen once we were dead in sin now we are dead to sin sin has no hall over us anymore very much sin has no right to us anymore yes sin has no uh of prevalence over us anymore yes we're dead to it sin is dead to us a child of god does not sin understand a child of god a born again holy ghost filled child of god does not sin amen you say how do you say that brother newton first john chapter 3 he that is born of the seed of god cannot sin for that seed remaineth in him yes you're no longer in sin you're dead to sin sin is death sin has no grip on you anymore amen sin has no hold on you anymore why because you have been born again anew of the holy spirit of god has made you a new creature and you no longer live the same life that you lose you used to you no longer live by the dictates of your mind the pleasures of your flesh right you live by the dictates of the word of god amen and by the moving of his holy spirit in your life thus you are dead to sin that nature has been changed yes you no longer live by nature as the children of wrath your nature now is god that's your nature and if god is your nature then how can that sin it can't sin now your flesh might slip up and make mistakes and do things it shouldn't do of course we know that but those are just superficial things that uh that that this flesh is past how still we have to put up with that's why we come before the lord say god forgive my sin but in your heart in your soul where god is where you really are right there is no sin amen cannot be sin amen cannot be sin even when we were dead in sins he quickened us together with christ now focus on that just a moment as we get to this the sixth verse is wrong the sixth verse is where i want to end he had quickened us made us alive together with christ amen with christ and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now won't you notice this three times three times paul puts in ephesians he has quickened us together with christ he has raised us up together and made us sin together in christ so we're together in christ we're together with one another and we're with one another in christ amen so we've been quickened we've been made alive we have been raised up caught up enraptured we've been enraptured in heavenly places in christ jesus if you're born again god has raised you up to that place to live in christ jesus a dimension a place that's higher than this dimension that we live in here yes it's better than this dimension that that our that our bodies are caught in no wonder brother brown said i'm so glad there's a device to get me out of this past house amen because that's where this man lives you know brother branham said that god has him live so high that everything remember brother green used to say this yes yes brother branham's god has me lived so high now where was brother branham she's right here he said if he came in and preached he was still alive and he came in priest for us he'd be standing behind this pulpit just like i am right he's listening to me he'd be sitting right there on that seat just like you all are right now yeah amen yes you would but god had him live so high that everything that we did in the sight of god was sin right yeah by the flesh of course you know by the flesh not by the spirit not by the life that's in us by the flesh so there's that being caught up that place of enrapture that place that god has for us in heavenly places in christ jesus so these bodies are creatures of the world friend but we aren't right amen we have been caught up together with christ with one another and with one another in christ praise the lord what is it now then so first thessalonians 4 gives us a preview of the physical rapture but ephesians 2 6 gives us the vision of a spiritual rapture of being spiritually raptured i mean i'm getting ahead of myself a little bit and i'll come back to it but where do you think enoch lived before god took him right where do you think he lived amen he didn't just live in in the flesh all the time he didn't just live his body was caught here but brother branham makes this reference he said enoch had got to where he lived so close to god that god said enoch you're closer to my home than you are down there so just come on up he was already in rapture yes he was already well he didn't have the holy ghost but he had god who do you think the holy ghost is amen amen he's he's god christ the word the holy spirit he's all the same amen he doesn't change he's the same amen the different one of these things play different parts but they're all one he's god amen but he was enraptured where do you think brother branham was when he was sitting there on his bed and he had his hands behind his head and god lifted him up from his body to where he could actually look down and see his body sitting on the bed or was he he was enraptured yes where do you think paul was when god said he took and caught me up to the third heavens where do you think he was amen amen look friend these aren't things that's just uh a figments of imagination or allegories this is this is truth this is fact this is where god's children live this is where we are in a state a perpetual state of of enrapturement and perpetual just means continual right it means that you're always there there's never a time of of being any different okay that's what perpetual means it is always right there that there's never a one second of being any place else or in any other condition it's a perpetual state of enrapturement where do you think paul went where do you think brother branham went thank god brother adam came back and told us what he saw god took him there saw his daughter saw his wife saw his horse saw his chair saw the things the the wonderful place and the testimony that we have that we're going to when this pest house relieves itself of us we're going there praise the lord and i'm looking forward to that friend why would we even want to think about being a coward to come kicking and screaming lord take me even so lord come quickly praise the lord but it's a perpetual state of enrapturement that that state of enragement a spiritual rapture that we live in all the time the changing of this body is the only element left right for the bride the only element left of her going in this first thessalonians 4 event rapture is the changing of these bodies that's the only thing left that's all that that's all that's left to be accomplished is for this body to change romans 8 to win the changing of these bodies that's all we're looking for the change in this is the only thing that keeps me this past house is the only thing that keeps us here otherwise friend we live we should be living in a state of enrapturement a state of being caught up a state of perpetually living in heavenly places living in christ jesus continually perpetually our entire lives that's why you see things differently that's why you talk differently that's why you act and dress differently because you're not a creature of this planet you have been caught up and enraptured till your very thinking has been changed to the to the thinking of god's word and you can't help but act that way you can't help but but be the person you are because you're caught up into that's who you are you're in that place you're living in that place you ever heard of assimilation of course this country doesn't think anybody needs to assimilate anymore but you've heard of assimilation where uh when in rome right it's not what they say when in rome do as the romans do that's i guess a cliche that's been for years since i've known when in rome do as the romans what does that mean that it means you assimilate you you if you go to rome then you should speak italian uh you you should be used to eating pasta and garlic bread and and and and all the cuisine and and everything that uh italians do and how they live nothing probably bugs my wife more than people coming here and uh and specifically for mexico but i guess coming from anywhere and try to come and and want to be this their country and i don't blame them best country in the world as bad as it is best country on the planet i don't blame them for wanting to come here but if you're going to come here learn english speak the language assimilate if you really want to then then do it and but my point of that is that that's what we do when you're enraptured and you're caught up you assimilate to where you're at your surroundings well your surroundings are heavenly places now amen if you're caught up if you're raptured spiritually raptured you're living in heavenly places so what do you do you assimilate yourself to the environment that you're living in sometimes even in your own body your language might change amen to a heavenly language that you don't know anything about you may not know how to speak it you can't go to the school and try to learn it there's not a babel or whatever that you can find an app on your phone that'll teach you how to speak that now there's there's uh there there's religious schools out there that'll try to teach you how to speak in tongues get your tongue all tangled up that's not speaking in tongues friend that's not men or angel amen that's just ungodly but it's not scriptural man anyway but your language might even change when you get enraptured your thought process changes the way you live your life changes the way you think about and view things changes people look out of the world today and they think oh there's nothing wrong with having 15 holes in my head you know 13 on each ear or eyebrows and all over and nose and you know when i was growing up we went to a place last night and you know girl had one sticking out of her nose and i said i don't mean i'm not making fun but i said the only when i was growing up the only place you saw one of those was it a heifer cow hanging out that's the only place i ever saw when i was a kid but anyway it doesn't mean that way anymore you know they can they can have one arm so colored up that you have no clue what the tattoo even says or both arms or whatever it up their necks and on their heads and all around i don't think anything about that and the world looks at it says oh what's wrong with that other nominal churches oh there's nothing wrong with that sure yeah you go right ahead you look at it you think how is that a heavenly place right amen how is scarring what's supposed to be the temple of the holy ghost living in a heavenly place but see they don't see anything wrong with that the world doesn't see anything wrong with it the world doesn't see anything wrong with with how they live and how they act and the things that they do it's become so prevalent now with with alcohol even they don't see anything or i would just drink a little of wine you know or before you know it you got a little wine going into a lot of wine going into a bottle or two a day amen a beer here beer there it's no big deal they don't see anything wrong with that but when you're living in heavenly places your viewpoint changes right when you look down upon the things that's of the world it's filth it's ungodly because you're in a different place you're in a different dimension you've assimilated to heavenly places so everything else around is just filth right the world looks at it and says oh that looks fine girl come out of a dressing room had got you know a teeth floss on their bodies oh that looks great you look uh wonderful dressed in floss really but see when you're in heavenly places you look at it you look and that's filth the world looks at it because they've assimilated to what's around them oh that's beard you're beautiful yeah that's what's the word they use hot you're hot that's the way the world looks at it you look at it a different way because you've been enraptured you're in a different place oh you're just old-fashioned no i'm just a godly holy ghost-filled christian amen and if that means being old-fashioned then yes i am label me all you want i don't have a problem you're not going to cancel me amen i'm going to be who i am regardless of what this canceled culture wants to do because the truth is the truth you believe it or not you need to go to hell or heaven it's your choice that's right amen amen i've seen advertisements lately now people are saying heaven or not is it really you can't say heaven or hell because that's what it's about right heaven or not what is it we're not it's hell right but you're by my point see you're living in heavenly places enraptured now together now what are we together what binds us saints what binds us what brings us together is it our church a lot of people want you to think it is oh it's it's my church this person came to my church is is and a lot of people go because that's my church that's what binds a lot of people the familiarity it's just a domination spirit it's what it is but a lot of people believe that way oh it's my church see it's church that brings us together is it doctrine a lot of people think doctrine is what brings people oh you've got to go hear him and the doctrine he preaches what not is his doctor what brings us together doctrine doesn't bring us together in fact a lot of times it's the doctrine is what separates us yeah right too many times the the attitude the pride and the the the arrogance that and the doctrines what separated well i'm right you're wrong well that might be but can't we be brothers right amen amen amen pray for us again next saturday we have another ministers meeting by the way it just came to my mind can't we still be brothers next saturday in phoenix we have another minister's meeting we come together as brothers that's the whole thing there's probably people there i've heard people speak i've heard different things being said that i don't particularly agree with but that's my brother i don't care right it's not that's not my separating dividing point amen what brings us together what is it that binds the bride because look friend there's going to be an international rapture this rapture is going to be all kindred's tongue people nation all around the world well there's people in the rapture 99.5 i've never even met how can i know what binds me to that brother over in marisha how do i know that binds me to that to that brother that may have just given his life in afghanistan by the way pray for them i got some bad news this week the underground church they had there in afghanistan the taliban finally tracked them down and gunned them all down killed the whole church everyone did somebody was actually on the phone into the united states when it happened they said they they said we had some boldness come on us and and uh the lord really blessed them and then all of a sudden the gun shots rang out and just slaughtered the whole underground church killed them all so anyway i was going to say something but i'm not going to but this this bride is international so if it's international i don't know what is it that binds us there's there can only be one thing that binds us together it's not our doctrine it's not the church you go to it's not the city you live in it's not cause you believe this message you know brother branham i mean that's not what binds us together because how many people you know that are in this message and still have differing opinions about what brother madam said right of course most of the time it's what brother branham meant i'm not a real big fan of what brother graham meant but what did he say but see what binds us together there can only be one thing god will only meet the worshiper under the shed blood of the innocent lamb amen that's the only place god meets the worshiper yes only place let me read you this quote in god's chosen place of worship february 1965 he said now being that there is 900 and something questions about where god meets he meets with the methodist or he meets with the baptist he meets with this he meets with that in the other now there's a question there so any so everyone has to seek out his own salvation with fear and trembling that is true everybody everyone you all have to have to uh work out your own salvation but you do it with fear and trembling amen amen so somebody comes living some ungodly life and says well i gotta work out my own salvation and say well yeah but the bible says you better do it with fear and trembling amen yes amen there's a big difference in just working it out and working it out with fear and trembling amen amen with fear and trembling but tonight i want to find and prove in the scripture where the correct place is where god meets and worships with the people and if it's and if that's it that's the only place the only place that he will ever meet us amen and as you know probably he goes on to talk about the only place god needs meets the worshiper is under that shed blood yes the shed blood of the innocent lamb is the only place that god will meet the worshiper that's what binds us together when the word talks about us coming together we come together in heavenly places we come together with christ we come together with one another with christ very much and that together binds us is that is that worship that that place that heavenly place of being under the shed blood of jesus christ amen that's what binds this bride together that's what brings her together amen that's what solidifies that bride as she sits in those heavenly places amen just a moment can i read a couple more scripture jude let's go to the book of jude there is no chapter but verse 14. jude is just one chapter jude 14. now we see that we know that enoch types the bride the gentile bride enoch hides the gentile bride in rapturing yes in in a literal rapture but also in that enoch as we read here let's read the 14th verse and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these things saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints adam enoch being seventh the seventh from adam is the type of the bride being in the seventh church age that takes the rapture now there's bride all through every church age right amen but the actual event of rapture the physical rapture changing of our bodies takes place at the end of the seventh church age amen now the seventh church age continues on after the rapture but it's right at the end there's three and a half years of tribulation and so forth but we know that that in rapture literal rapture physical rapture body change takes place at the seventh church age so not only does does jude vindicate the serpent seed by nullifying cain as abel's son amen because if you put cain in adam's lineage that makes enoch 8 from adam not seven the only way you can make enoch the seventh from adam is to alleviate cain hallelujah because cain was of that wicked one right cain was the serpent seen not the son of adam amen so in adam adam's lineage enoch was the seventh from adam as that type of the seventh church age taking the rapture right the time that we're living now that type of that seventh church age is the rapture time amen the physical changing body rapture time that's where we're living we're living at that time the at the end can i say of laodicea church age we're living at the closing scenes of the laodicean church age yes it's got a little bit more to go of course like i said even after the rapture there'll be a little bit more now if if enoch was in rapture translated let's look at a couple other scriptures you don't have to turn here but in genesis chapter 5 verse 24 it says enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him right so what was enoch doing before god took him he was walking with god amen that's pretty simple it's not a lot that describes it not a whole lot that goes into it even though june jude said that enoch prophesied did you notice here for enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these things his rapturing his translating his going away prophesy of what was going to happen in the seventh church amen he walked with god as he walked with god god took him amen hebrews hebrews chapter 11 by faith enoch was translated amen that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him but before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god so the focus i want to make on this scripture just like the previous one is what was going on at the moment enoch was translated what was he doing what was his life like how was he acting where was he at it's spiritually well it tells us genesis said he walked with god hebrews said he had a testimony that he pleased god before he was translated he had this testimony that he pleased god amen amen that's pretty simple and when you break all down to it you come filter all through the denominations go through all the messages message churches you go you go fill to filter through all these things and it really boils down to the fact that are we is my life pleasing to the lord yes that's really what it boils down to amen and i believe that's why at the end of the seventh church age that brother branham said just live a good holy uh godly holy ghost christian life yes be the best christian you can be amen amen be pleasing to the lord that's the whole point now obviously without the holy ghost and obedience in his word you can't be pleasing to god because obedience is better than sacrifice amen we the only way to be pleasing to the lord is to be obedient to him and you can't be obedient to him unless you end the word filled with the holy spirit yeah amen which are the same but when you're in that capacity of the lord then when you're living in a heavenly place you're living in the atmospheres of where god dwells and your whole assimilation to that atmosphere is scriptural and godly how could you keep but from pleasing god amen how could you keep but from walking with god your whole vision has changed your whole perspective in life the way you think the way you see things like i said earlier it's different than the world of course they see and they don't you know all the ungodly things they don't see any problem with it you look at it you say my that looks horrible why would somebody look like that why would they do that to their bodies why would they wear that why do people go to this place why would people watch this this shouldn't even exist because people it wouldn't exist if people didn't watch it right a place wouldn't exist if people didn't go there if nobody went there it would close they would shut it off they would stop it so there's got to be multitudes of people doing it i think why well i say why because i'm living in a total different place i'm enraptured friend and the way i see it is so different than the way everybody else sees it well how's the way you see it is the way god sees it right amen and the way god sees it then then when you're living with that might of god let the mind of christ be in you that you you live in a place that that you're going to be pleasing to the lord you can't help but walk with god when you're in that dimension you can't help but please god when you're living in that place you can't help it because it's just who you are you know when the lord gave me that revelation about that i never realized to what degree would unfold itself in my ministry but it really has become about almost everything i am who i am because that's what god made me and he made me that way to be pleasing to him so everything i do i do to be pleasing to him is just because it's who i am amen i can't see it any other way i can't live it any other way i have absolutely no desire to go back in the world and live the way i used to none it's disgusting filth to me it's like saying hey newton there's a there's six foot of flowing sewage down underneath this street why don't you hop in the manhole oh yeah sure why don't we do that go for a swim i have no interest in diving into six foot of sewage and i have no desire to dive into the world again which is worse than the sewage because we live in a different place pleasing to god the testimony that we're pleasing to god that's why god would say enter into the joys of the lord you've been faithful amen because that's the place that god has you live your testimony is pleasing to the lord one more think about this philip when philip met the eunuch now this has happened of course other places and times and uh we don't know them all or all the events that this may have happened but you know when philip met the eunuch philip after he baptized the eunuch was gone he was translated just like enoch was translated what translated to mean is just took taken away or taken from one place to another amen now we believe that enoch was taken from this earth to not see death philip was translated and all of a sudden he was found in some other whole another city i mean as soon as they as soon as the eunuch the bible says came up from being baptized he opened his eyes and looked and philip was gone right and philip shows up in a whole other city somewhere because god translated the bible says god took him away which is the same greek word as the caught up in 1st thessalonians 4. amen the same greek word caught up he was removed from one place over to another now philip had a job to finish whatever it was that god had him do scripturally we could read but whatever god god philip had another job and god had to have him over here so god just took him and plucked him and put him over here he was translated enoch was translated now the bible says that enoch lived 365 years brother graham says many places 500. now was there a rounding up was there a rounding down i don't know i i don't concern myself with those things it doesn't it doesn't involve uh my salvation my salvation is not based on whether you're not going to hear 500 or 365. but could he have been translated there's no record scripturally that we know he showed up any other place like we do philip we don't know all we know is he is translated and he was not because god took him philip was found in a different city because he was translated where do you think philip was living where do you think brother branham was living where do you think paul was living what do you think it means that let me read this where we're supposed to live in this last day where god wants us revelation 4 1. after this i looked and behold a door was open and remember this after the bride's gone bride goes up in revelation 3. and this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was uh was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you these things which must be hereafter where do you think john was going when when when that voice spoke to him and said come up hither where do i get a space rocket i hope i'm being silly but you understand the point right john was standing right there when he was caught up when god took him to a place to where he had greater vision spiritual vision amen not not natural human vision i mean you couldn't boil the holy ghost out of the man so uh in nevada oil so uh so but when he was caught up he was caught up to a place that god could show him something right god had to take his spirit himself out just like brother branham could look down and see his body but he did he couldn't do it down there he had to bring him up to a place that there was greater vision and that's where god wants us to live amen if we don't get anything today friend that's what god that's where god wants us to live we should be as holy ghosts feel godly christians the children of god we should be living in that place where god will we walk with god are pleasing to the lord and have a testimony that we are pleasing to god in rapture perpetually in rapture so when the body change takes place why is just a change of venue just you know we read last week program said that ufo you see that we call them ifos identified flying authors come around he said they're gonna pick you up one of these days little children don't be afraid don't worry about it you see the increase in activity saints we talked about last week amen no doubt there's probably been more of it because there's more cameras around people taking pictures but a lot of the sightings nowadays have been from like military ships aircraft battleships stuff like that have been videoing these these events taking place and watching these things streak across the sky at speeds humans know nothing about and the pentagon says well area 51. everybody's they they all talk about this great conspiracy well we you know we we we we it and they don't know right they have no idea they want to pretend like they know because they're proud we're we're the smartest people ever to live on the planet and they don't have don't know how to build a blade of grass right amen they don't know what these things flying across here but we know what they are thanks thank you praise the lord for a profit of this last day nobody's going to drop down pick you up one these days say yes amen praise it don't worry about it amen don't don't let it worry you it's a supernatural event you can't put god in the box like you said last week supernatural event god's gonna let it happen it's gonna be amen praise and i'll look forward that time if god doesn't if the if if death doesn't take me and we go in the rapture which i'm expecting amen brother banner was expected brother green was expecting i'm expecting it yes to go on a rapture but if we don't our children will see it praise the lord there'll be a time it'll come and it'll sweep us up for it changing the moment and twinkling of an eye yeah amen praise the lord of course we know we'll see our loved ones first be here for a minimum 30 days amen but i but remember saints i believe i'm going to say this in close i believe that brother brown doesn't say this and it's not the bible it's a scriptural type now but when noah went on the ark god shut the door and when god shut the door it didn't rain judgment didn't fall in its entire in its uh uh fullness at that time it didn't rain but god shut the door and there was nobody could get in that ark and there was nobody could get out amen in fact the bible says they came knocked on the door no let us sin i can't let you in god shut the door well come on out no i can't come out god shut the door nobody could get in and nobody could get out i think that's going to be that time with the dead in christ rise at that time it's going to be over yes there won't be any more coming in and there won't be any more of course why would you want to get out but there won't be any more coming in amen it'll be that time where it'll be shut blood's off the mercy seat and there'll be nothing but judgment no judgment will not have come and it's earnest yet right because we got a minimum of 30 days here but it will come yeah and the body changing will be gone and friend there'll be nothing left but judgment amen god help us we're at that time yes amen we're at that time we'll see however much time there is we don't know day week month year years we don't know but we do know that we're at that time and that season here right now as we see all these things unfolding around us amen praise the lord let's stand if we could praise the lord aren't you thankful that we have the promises of god's word that gives us a hope that gives us an encouragement gives us a place that we can be at peace and live and know that the plan of god is working its will in our lives amen praise the lord i love him with all my heart don't you i'm glad as brother brown said i'm glad there's a place they're glad there's a vehicle to separate me from this pest house and the next time after that that i'll visit this pest house it'll be in a glorified condition so it won't be a pestilence anymore it'll be like it was supposed to be in the beginning yes when god said let there be and created there it was perfect amen that's the way it'll be again i'm looking forward to that time amen praise the lord jesus wonderful amen till then we tarry till he comes yes amen praise the lord let's sing that psalm number 399 amen psalm number 399 until then thank you [Music] my jesus can see when i pause to remember a horny stepping stone along the trail that's winding always upwards [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] amen hallelujah praise the lord until then amen will tarry till he comes yeah we'll live a humble godly christian life a testimony is pleasing to the lord and if you should translate us whatever it may be here to there or on the other side amen there'll be a great reward waiting for all of us amen praise the lord god bless you pray something with said the blessed strength and today god's been so good to us you love him a lot going on in the world today friend a lot of a lot of things happening too i i me and brother roger were talking about it this week you look on facebook and you hear things said and it's like it used to be you you'd see a one or two pass away it used to be a little thing where they went in threes and you used to say that or i've heard that i don't know people would go in threes it seems like dozens now yeah they're going in dozens and not just covet uh several code but not all coping yeah i know several people that have passed away recently and not been coping but it just it's it there's got to be a spiritual significance to what's going on now yeah and a lot of believers a lot of people i know even brother dan i pray for brother daniel evans who was here a couple weeks ago you know spoke for us uh his first cousin just passed away uh ronald evans if you know ron ronnie evans welch evans was the man brother branham was with and spoke about and he had he had his sons uh ronnie was one of them and ronnie had ronald evans ronald just passed away worked for voice of god uh used to live here in tucson went to cdo who right after i graduated he went to high school here uh and worked at the voice of god he just passed away too i just saw it and text brother dan he said yeah he had passed away and prayed for the family so and he said he was real close to ronald when they were younger so please pray for the evans family i saw a brother that worked for wmo and sent me flyers like every month of his missionary work brother don furon he just passed away two or three people i know brother uh roger talked about and he knew in florida and south africa and it just seems like and that's on top of the ones we already have known about right uh it just it's just uh there's something there's spiritual significance to this somehow i don't know what it is but i do think maybe maybe the lord maybe there's a there's a little bit of light left in this country because the supreme court this week upheld an abortion ruling in texas that as soon as you could detect a fetal heartbeat abortion became illegal now of course you know the liberals and all they're just going crazy democrats the president they're screaming and yelling but the supreme court they're the ultimate voice here when it comes to the law and the legality according to the constitution and they ruled it constitutional for that state to put a limitation on the abortion that's huge and when you think of a law being passed in this country that would be that limiting to abortion today uh it makes me have a little bit of hope amen there's a little bit of hope and i'm thinking if there's a fetal heartbeat if there if that little baby in there has got a heartbeat and people still want to rip its head off and destroy it and kill it and kill and call it tissue there's some that that's just that's demonic that's demonic but but i i'd like to celebrate the little victory at least for now that the supreme court ruled that texas can pass that law that if they uh fetal heartbeat then then the abortion's illegal so on amen you never know but there's there's so much this is going on around us just continue to pray pray for uh the needs and requests uh brother angel's dad angel jr um is is is needing a miracle yes he's needing a a real touch from the lord he's still sedated he's still on a ventilator they say there's been no change which from what i have learned with covet is not necessarily a good thing um usually they say if it's not getting better that's good or not getting worse that's good but in kobe's case when what from what i found out if you don't start getting better fairly quickly it's not good right uh that being said god's still a miracle-working guy yes god can perform a miracle god can step right into that spiritual right spiritually step right in that hospital room right now and touch angel junior and he'll get up out of that bed right now so i'm not denying that amen but uh but but our prayers prevailing before the lord for our brother so remember that if you would brother angel third is doing much much better he's doing uh doing really good actually yeah he's still having a little struggle with his breath but other than that he's he's mostly over the pneumonia he had he's doing good so and like i said i think last week the whole family tested again for colbert and tested negative uh but please remember and genevieve too please remember genevieve brother angel junior's wife in prayer too she's i'm sure going through a very hard time as well on the whole family so please remember them in prayer if you would amen and the evans family and all those who've been loved ones has been passing amen god has a has a purpose but remember thank god for that door yes amen whether god uses covet as a vehicle to do it or if he uses cancer as a vehicle to do it if he uses a heart attack or what whatever vehicle god uses if if god just takes your spirit out of your body you say well why what was the cause of his death god took him home that's just be on a death certificate you know covet or cancer or a heart attack or what took him home god what cold what caused him to die god took him home that's right that's simple and i i'm sorry i may be simplifying a bit much but that's the way i see it that's the way i think when i come to that door friend i don't want to come to it as a coward amen praise the lord jesus and i want to and and if i do come to that door i want to come to it serving him with everything i've got within me yes amen so thank you for coming today god bless you amen appreciate each one of you thank the lord jesus
