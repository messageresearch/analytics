[30:09] i had heard this week
[30:11] now uh maybe thanks buddy
[30:13] maybe um
[30:15] uh brother wilson or some others could
[30:17] help me here but i had heard this week
[30:19] that brother harold hildebrandt passed
[30:20] away and that is true so
[30:24] i had been unable to verify i've been
[30:26] kind of busy and i've checked on
[30:28] facebook a little here and there i don't
[30:30] i'm very sold them on facebook so but i
[30:32] looked to see if i could find any
[30:33] verification of it or anything and i
[30:35] couldn't so thank you for the dan
[30:37] brother wilson for verifying that for me
[30:39] that brother harold hildebrand of those
[30:42] probably most of us all know brother
[30:44] harold from canada precious brother
[30:47] um
[30:47] and he passed away this week so let's
[30:49] please remember the family the friends
[30:51] church there uh in edmonton i believe
[30:54] he's still in edmonton buddy in edmonton
[30:56] um
[30:57] so let's remember them in prayer if you
[30:59] would it's
[31:00] certainly a great loss last week we had
[31:03] prayer for brother mike patterson who
[31:04] had a stroke up in phoenix
[31:07] and
[31:08] as a result looks like he's closing his
[31:10] church doors so you know friend it just
[31:13] as time continues to roll on this will
[31:16] continue to happen i've talked to
[31:18] brother roger many times you know
[31:19] brother roger
[31:21] collins family and baron tabernacle and
[31:23] i said you know brother roger it may get
[31:24] to the time where there's not a single
[31:26] person alive that knew brother branham
[31:28] or was here during that time or you know
[31:31] all the old timers are going away so
[31:33] amen it's up to us to continue to press
[31:35] that battle yes and if it's after us
[31:37] brother dan you're about my age it's
[31:40] after us and it'll be up to my grandson
[31:42] and those others to keep it going amen i
[31:44] praise the lord we don't know but you
[31:46] know brother branham said 60 years ago
[31:48] could go another 100 years and not break
[31:50] scripture at all
[31:51] amen
[31:53] in fact i heard him say the other day
[31:55] uh
[31:56] it was
[31:58] well maybe i'll save that for later but
[32:01] he said it was a hundred years after the
[32:03] prophecy that it actually came to pass
[32:05] so
[32:06] uh
[32:07] we got another 40 years if that happens
[32:09] you don't know but we don't know that's
[32:11] the whole point so

[46:22] that song
[46:24] that was good
[46:25] that i'm reaching out to you you know
[46:27] there was there was a time that jesus
[46:30] always taught his disciples he taught
[46:32] them to follow in his footsteps yes and
[46:34] he taught them how to handle certain
[46:36] situations
[46:37] and he told them that one day that this
[46:40] same spirit that's in me is going to
[46:42] come in you yes and there was a time
[46:45] when when jesus was out walking on the
[46:48] water
[46:49] and one of his disciples
[46:51] walked out to meet him
[46:54] and
[46:55] he didn't quite have the faith and he he
[46:58] started to sing
[46:59] and he reached out to the lord jesus
[47:02] and like you said his arm was not too
[47:04] short amen the lord jesus reached down
[47:07] there and grabbed him back and how many
[47:08] of us have been in that situation
[47:11] you know we've tried our best
[47:13] to follow
[47:14] in the footsteps of our lord jesus
[47:18] and we just fail
[47:20] but he knows we're going to fail and he
[47:22] reaches down there and his arm's not too
[47:24] short sister he he grabs us and he pulls
[47:26] us back up amen i'm so thankful amen for
[47:29] the grace of god praise the lord yes
[47:32] this morning
[47:35] i woke up and
[47:36] and just praying about what i was going
[47:39] to say today
[47:41] and
[47:42] i made the mistake of
[47:44] getting on my phone and looking in the
[47:46] news and
[47:48] their friends
[47:49] this is a bad time yeah this is a time
[47:52] that the world has never seen i'm
[47:55] telling you not up on that up on the
[47:57] news
[47:58] they had the usa today they were talking
[48:00] about
[48:01] censoring speech
[48:03] and all of you heard about probably elon
[48:05] musk and everything that he's doing and
[48:07] buying these these social media platform
[48:09] and all that
[48:10] but
[48:11] they had
[48:13] usa today
[48:14] had
[48:15] one of the final nominations that if it
[48:17] wasn't the uh the final one that they
[48:20] chose of the woman of the year
[48:23] for usa today
[48:25] and i looked at it and it was one of the
[48:27] most hideous things i've ever seen
[48:29] it was a man dressed up as a woman
[48:32] and and we think about
[48:35] when
[48:36] i always wondered when i was a kid
[48:38] i always wondered that
[48:39] brother branham would say as it was in
[48:41] the days of lot
[48:44] in the sodom condition i always wondered
[48:47] that why did brother branham take that
[48:49] scripture in luke 17 and apply it to his
[48:52] ministry
[48:54] and as a young man i didn't understand
[48:55] that as it was in the days of life why
[48:58] why is that applied to brother brando's
[49:01] ministry but now i see yes i can see
[49:05] that it was we are living in today where
[49:08] that
[49:09] spirit is so strong
[49:11] and everybody's afraid of it
[49:13] you notice you notice a lot true when
[49:16] when those men
[49:18] those angels came and visited lot and
[49:20] his family
[49:21] and and the mobs came
[49:24] he was the mayor of the city brother
[49:25] wilson he was a politician yeah he was
[49:28] up there and he was afraid of that yeah
[49:30] he was afraid of that lobby he was
[49:32] afraid of those people and we see that
[49:34] today yeah we see these things
[49:36] manifesting themselves and
[49:38] i was just i was so sad this morning
[49:41] that this once great country yes it's
[49:44] falling into
[49:46] this mess
[49:47] and it's it's
[49:49] it's sun that's going into
[49:52] and it just it breaks my heart and
[49:55] and i see i know that the scriptures
[49:58] teach us that when these things start to
[50:00] pass that we look up yes because our
[50:03] redemption is drawing nigh right sir but
[50:06] it's it's also a sad thing yes it is
[50:08] it's a sad thing of what's happening
[50:10] absolutely but we do we do look up in
[50:12] this and the word also teaches us that
[50:15] this is the time that we should just
[50:16] cling so much more closely
[50:18] together
[50:20] yes and that's what
[50:22] i was thinking about this morning in the
[50:24] past few days is we need to cling that
[50:26] much closer together in these last days
[50:29] in this time yes like never before very
[50:32] true but i believe
[50:34] that
[50:35] we
[50:36] in the christian
[50:38] population in general is failing in that
[50:42] matter yeah
[50:43] and that will be
[50:44] my message this morning is i want to
[50:47] talk about christ's square
[50:49] in the church amen and i'll get there
[50:53] and get to where christ prayed for this
[50:55] unity
[50:56] but first i want to read a scripture if
[50:58] we could stand for a minute
[51:00] and turn to saint john chapter 10.
[51:10] and again friends i'm honored to be here
[51:11] i i appreciate brother bennett and the
[51:14] love that you've shown me and
[51:17] the confidence amen that you've asked me
[51:20] to come speak
[51:21] i also did a great speed my friend wrote
[51:23] scott over there
[51:25] with the wilson system and arlene it's
[51:27] always good to see you saint john
[51:28] chapter 10
[51:31] verse 11.
[51:32] this is our lord jesus speaking he says
[51:34] this he says i am the good shepherd
[51:38] the good shepherd giveth his life
[51:40] amen but he that is a hireling and not
[51:43] the shepherd whose own sheep whose own
[51:46] the sheep are not see it the wolf coming
[51:48] and leaving the sheep and flee
[51:50] and the wolf catches them and scattereth
[51:52] the sheep
[51:54] the hireling
[51:56] fleet
[51:57] because he's a hireling and careth not
[51:59] for the sheep
[52:01] i am the good chef amen and know my
[52:04] sheep yes and have known of mine right
[52:07] as a father knoweth me even so i even so
[52:11] i the father
[52:12] and i laid down my life for the sheep
[52:15] amen now listen to this
[52:18] and other sheep i have
[52:21] which are not of this bowl
[52:24] them also i must bring and they shall
[52:26] hear my voice
[52:28] and there shall be one fold
[52:32] may god add the blessings amen to the
[52:35] reading of his word you may be seated
[52:39] i was uh when i was walking in
[52:41] i saw your book brother ben and i i
[52:43] didn't know that you wrote a book
[52:45] i saw that the title in there is the
[52:47] root of bitterness
[52:49] and i thought it was very fitting
[52:51] for what i'm going to say today i
[52:53] haven't read it yet but i'd like to read
[52:54] it
[52:55] good yeah
[52:57] i mean i wasn't hinting
[53:03] thank you
[53:04] i'm looking forward to it
[53:06] there is there's so much bitterness
[53:08] there's so much division
[53:10] within the body of what we call the body
[53:13] of christ today
[53:14] and it's it's a scary thought and we
[53:16] look back at what jesus said here in
[53:18] john chapter 10 and he says this he says
[53:21] he says there shall be one fold and one
[53:24] shepherd
[53:25] amen and yet we have all these different
[53:27] groups we have all of these different
[53:30] divisions of christianity and all these
[53:32] divisions now within the message
[53:35] within the so-called message that god
[53:37] sent a prophet
[53:39] to turn to call the people out
[53:42] of the denominational system and it's a
[53:44] spirit
[53:46] of that segregating system where we're
[53:48] better than this person or this group is
[53:50] better than that group amen because he
[53:52] sent this prophet to pull us out of that
[53:55] yes
[53:56] and then friends i fear i don't fear i
[53:59] think we have we've gone right back into
[54:00] it
[54:02] amen we did it we see in the the
[54:04] apostles time
[54:06] that there was this beautiful unity
[54:08] which i'll talk about for a while and
[54:10] then
[54:12] they started dividing yes
[54:14] and then we see separation
[54:16] and then we see we see luther he comes
[54:18] and he reforms and then they start they
[54:21] form a denomination out of luther we see
[54:23] all these different things through the
[54:25] through the
[54:26] past
[54:27] and then god sends a prophet
[54:29] an end-time prophet
[54:32] and we do the same thing yeah
[54:34] and now we have all these different
[54:36] denominations within brother branham's
[54:39] message
[54:40] and i know brother branham said that
[54:42] this message couldn't denominate but he
[54:43] also said the bible could denominate and
[54:45] it can't the word denominated it's us
[54:47] that had those spirits feared
[54:50] and it it uh
[54:53] it's something that we need to be
[54:54] careful of it's something that we need
[54:56] to overcome yes
[54:58] yeah yeah i was out yesterday there's a
[55:01] there's a
[55:03] man about my age
[55:05] that i've been witnessing too
[55:08] and uh about six months now i've been
[55:10] dealing with this man he's a christian
[55:12] man
[55:13] and
[55:14] he knew that i get away and i pray and
[55:17] he asked me he said will you take me to
[55:20] that place that you pray
[55:22] he said i really i really i need to get
[55:24] right with god
[55:26] there's things there's questions i have
[55:28] in my heart
[55:29] i said sure
[55:30] of course i will
[55:32] and he's told me before he says you know
[55:34] he says he says i've been i became a
[55:36] christian a while ago and and he looks
[55:38] to me as kind of a leader
[55:41] but then he he looks at me he asks he
[55:44] asks questions
[55:45] about the word and he'll go to church
[55:47] you know the pastor will say a certain
[55:49] thing and he says it doesn't quite feel
[55:51] right well what about this scripture
[55:53] and then we have these discussions
[55:56] and he wanted to go up and he wanted to
[55:58] pray yesterday which we did we spent a
[56:00] good part of the day up in the mountains
[56:02] praying and just to ourselves and
[56:05] sitting within a i don't know within 50
[56:08] feet of each other but just seeking the
[56:09] lord on our own
[56:11] quiet timing for the lord
[56:13] and as we were going back
[56:16] um
[56:17] one of the one of the questions he had
[56:19] was that about his career
[56:20] and i asked him i said i said mark what
[56:22] about your career where do you think
[56:24] that what's the direction you think
[56:26] you'll go now
[56:28] and he says you know i felt like the
[56:29] lord told me as we were up there just to
[56:31] stay where i'm at and be patient
[56:33] because because things were going to
[56:35] change
[56:36] good
[56:38] and uh we were walking down the hill and
[56:40] down the mountain and i was in front
[56:42] there's a trail and he was behind me and
[56:45] and he says brother daniel he says uh
[56:47] what about you
[56:49] he said
[56:51] i know and he's come to the church but
[56:53] listen to the tabernacle a couple times
[56:54] and
[56:56] um enjoyed it and he says where do you
[57:00] see you
[57:02] he said you asked me where you see me he
[57:04] said how about you and he says i'm not
[57:06] talking about your work i'm talking
[57:07] about your ministry
[57:09] he says where do you see that going and
[57:13] i was he says what do you hope to
[57:14] accomplish
[57:16] going down the mountain and i said
[57:19] i said you know
[57:20] what if i could have anything
[57:23] i said i would like
[57:25] to be able
[57:27] to
[57:28] take the little group of fellowships
[57:31] that the lord has given me
[57:33] and the people that i know
[57:35] i would like to bring
[57:37] these people together
[57:39] i would like to bring them together in
[57:40] love and immunity and somehow i'd like
[57:43] to have a role in that and i said you
[57:45] know what i also would like to see i
[57:46] would like to see other men of god do
[57:49] the same thing whether they be in the
[57:51] baptist denomination or whether they be
[57:53] in the mega churches or the or the
[57:55] different churches in all of
[57:56] christianity i would like to see men of
[57:59] god raise up
[58:02] and bring people together even though
[58:04] they might not see things the same
[58:07] even though they may not have the same
[58:08] doctrines but they all believe in jesus
[58:10] christ and you know what he said he said
[58:12] that's impossible
[58:15] and you know what he's right
[58:17] he said that's impossible
[58:20] he said that could never happen
[58:23] he's been a christian long enough i
[58:24] guess to know it
[58:26] and i said
[58:28] but
[58:29] it is possible
[58:31] because jesus prayed
[58:34] and
[58:35] i uh
[58:37] got me thinking and i thought you know
[58:39] that's that's what i will minister on
[58:42] tomorrow
[58:43] is on the unity of the church in
[58:45] christ's prayer let's turn to ephesians
[58:47] 4.
[58:57] ephesians chapter 4 verse 1.
[58:59] the apostle paul is speaking he says i
[59:01] therefore
[59:02] the prisoner of the lord beseech you
[59:05] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[59:07] wherewith you are called
[59:09] with lowliness with all lowliness and
[59:11] meekness with long suffering forbearing
[59:15] one another
[59:17] in love right
[59:19] keep your place there friends forbearing
[59:21] having patience with one another
[59:24] you know if if i'm here today and i'm
[59:26] ministering i'll probably say something
[59:29] that may not resonate well with you that
[59:31] you may disagree with but i ask you have
[59:34] patience with yeah have patience with me
[59:37] because paul says here have patience
[59:39] with one another amen and we may make
[59:42] mistakes
[59:43] but we're all christians we have that
[59:45] same shepherd amen right i'm always
[59:48] asking my wife
[59:50] to do that with me
[59:53] to have patience with me because i'm not
[59:56] perfect and we make mistakes yeah
[1:00:00] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:00:02] spirit in the bond of peace
[1:00:05] there is one body and one spirit
[1:00:08] even as you are called in one hope of
[1:00:09] your calling one lord
[1:00:11] one faith
[1:00:13] one baptism
[1:00:14] one god and the father of all who is
[1:00:16] above all and through all and in you all
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] and friends i must admit until recently
[1:00:24] i have never considered the importance
[1:00:28] of unity among the body
[1:00:30] you know we as always we're thinking
[1:00:32] about
[1:00:33] the third pole
[1:00:35] you know we're thinking about these
[1:00:36] things that are prophesied to happen
[1:00:38] we're thinking about the squeeze that's
[1:00:40] supposed to come on the people we're
[1:00:42] thinking about all these different
[1:00:44] things we're thinking about doing great
[1:00:45] signs and great wonders and great
[1:00:47] miracles and
[1:00:49] we're thinking about those things but we
[1:00:51] neglect
[1:00:53] the most important thing that we can do
[1:00:55] which is love one another amen and have
[1:00:57] this unity among one another yes
[1:01:00] right
[1:01:02] i don't think we should all be one
[1:01:03] church
[1:01:04] and i'm not saying that but we should be
[1:01:07] one body right amen yes each member of
[1:01:09] the body has a different role and the
[1:01:12] same with our churches each church we
[1:01:14] may fit in
[1:01:16] well in this church
[1:01:17] and we're in the lord's will but that
[1:01:20] doesn't make this church better than
[1:01:21] another church and that other church
[1:01:23] doesn't look at this church
[1:01:25] and say that we're better we have more
[1:01:27] understanding that's right or whatever
[1:01:29] god's placed each of us yes and we need
[1:01:32] to make sure that we're in that place
[1:01:33] amen that he's placed us yes brother
[1:01:36] true we hear so often of california
[1:01:38] sinking and we hear so often of the pope
[1:01:43] and these different things
[1:01:45] but i think that we neglect
[1:01:47] the most important thing
[1:01:49] and it's not an easy thing to love one
[1:01:51] another right we need to have patience
[1:01:53] with one another as paul said amen there
[1:01:55] was there was a time in history
[1:01:59] that we call it the day of pentecost
[1:02:02] today pentecost was one of the greatest
[1:02:04] days in history because that is the day
[1:02:08] that jesus christ himself
[1:02:10] entered in to the body of man
[1:02:13] and went
[1:02:14] and they went out and they did the same
[1:02:16] works yes that jesus did amen but you'll
[1:02:19] notice
[1:02:20] in at the day of pentecost
[1:02:23] they were
[1:02:24] in one place
[1:02:26] it's not prophesied that we was one
[1:02:27] place now but they were with one accord
[1:02:30] yes they had one purpose amen a brother
[1:02:33] uh texted me this morning
[1:02:36] and uh he said uh
[1:02:39] you preaching this morning
[1:02:40] and i said i said yeah i'll be
[1:02:42] bennett's and he said what are you
[1:02:43] preaching
[1:02:44] and i said i said you know
[1:02:47] the body
[1:02:49] and uh
[1:02:50] he said
[1:02:53] he said that
[1:02:54] he said well he says that's a big
[1:02:56] subject let me uh let me read what he
[1:02:59] said here i'll read it off my phone
[1:03:02] his brother joe do you know brother
[1:03:04] gentlemen
[1:03:07] um
[1:03:08] he said this
[1:03:13] he said
[1:03:15] he asked me this he said what builds
[1:03:17] unity and i said a common goal
[1:03:21] and he says amen he says it's usually
[1:03:24] when we experience an incredible monster
[1:03:26] of a shared problem
[1:03:28] and that's what drives us together and
[1:03:30] that's what drove those people at the
[1:03:32] day of pentecost together
[1:03:34] he they were running from the jews
[1:03:36] they were persecuted and then they come
[1:03:38] into this place in one mine and one
[1:03:41] accord and then the holy spirit felt
[1:03:43] they had one purpose and that purpose
[1:03:45] was to promote jesus christ was to
[1:03:47] introduce others to jesus christ
[1:03:51] let's turn to uh
[1:03:52] james chapter one
[1:03:55] and uh
[1:03:56] i'm going to get rolling here in a
[1:03:58] minute
[1:03:59] but in james chapter 1 verse 22
[1:04:04] we talk about unity and it's
[1:04:06] you say well well daniel you're coming
[1:04:08] and
[1:04:09] and you're talking about this unity we
[1:04:12] all know that our church is unified our
[1:04:15] church we all love one another and and
[1:04:18] we do
[1:04:19] but we are not there yet right
[1:04:22] i don't think that we're even close amen
[1:04:24] i think that there's a lot of more that
[1:04:26] we have to do
[1:04:28] and it says this in james 1 22 he says
[1:04:31] wherefore laying apart all filthiness
[1:04:33] and superfluity of naughtiness in your
[1:04:35] scofield bible that says overflowing
[1:04:37] wickedness
[1:04:38] and received with meekness the engrafted
[1:04:40] word which is able to save your soul yes
[1:04:42] be doers of the word and not hear zone
[1:04:46] you're deceiving your own selves
[1:04:49] if there is no desire in the church to
[1:04:51] grow
[1:04:52] to change to be molded into the stature
[1:04:55] of a perfect man i don't want to be part
[1:04:58] of that amen i don't want to be part of
[1:05:00] a church i was just walking along and
[1:05:02] saying oh we're just waiting for
[1:05:04] something to happen right if you're just
[1:05:07] waiting for something to happen and
[1:05:08] you're not doing something as james said
[1:05:10] here guess what nothing's gonna happen
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:13] we're gonna keep going on and nothing
[1:05:15] nothing will ever
[1:05:17] happen we will just keep going this is
[1:05:19] this this is what the prophet said this
[1:05:21] is a quote from we would see jesus he
[1:05:23] said and i believe that there is the
[1:05:25] need of healing tonight
[1:05:27] more than physical healing i believe
[1:05:29] it's a spiritual healing for the sickest
[1:05:32] body i know of amen
[1:05:35] the body of jesus christ this is the
[1:05:36] sickest body i know
[1:05:39] that's a bold state that's right
[1:05:41] he goes on here
[1:05:43] it's so broke up in so many different
[1:05:45] denominations and factions
[1:05:50] here
[1:05:52] and so we're trying to do our best by
[1:05:54] the gospel to heal that broken body that
[1:05:57] all people might come together with one
[1:06:00] great unity
[1:06:01] amen i don't mean you have to leave your
[1:06:04] church and make and all of them make one
[1:06:06] organization
[1:06:08] stay in your organization
[1:06:11] it doesn't hurt anything
[1:06:14] but be brothers while you're in your
[1:06:16] organization amen i was a baptist as you
[1:06:19] know
[1:06:20] and i'm still a baptist i'm a
[1:06:22] pentecostal baptist since i've received
[1:06:24] the holy spirit you see when brother
[1:06:26] branham was saying that he says yeah i'm
[1:06:27] still i'm still part of him he said
[1:06:30] but now i'm drawing the circle bigger
[1:06:33] yeah now i'm i'm bringing all you in
[1:06:36] before i was just a baptist and i was in
[1:06:38] my own little circle
[1:06:40] but now i receive the holy spirit and
[1:06:42] i'm drawing my circle bigger amen with
[1:06:45] all of with all of you all right
[1:06:48] brother branham came out
[1:06:50] of that organization but he didn't leave
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:55] remember my scripture on john takes 10
[1:06:57] 16 he says and other sheep i have which
[1:07:00] are not of this fold yes them also i
[1:07:02] must bring that they shall hear my voice
[1:07:04] and there shall be one fold and one
[1:07:08] shepherd amen
[1:07:10] hear so many people talk about you
[1:07:12] we hear so many talk about unity as long
[1:07:15] as you're on my grounds yeah as long as
[1:07:17] you do what i say as long as you believe
[1:07:20] the doctrines that i believe then we
[1:07:22] will have unity in matthew 23
[1:07:25] matthew 23 verse 1 he says this and
[1:07:29] jesus and then spake jesus to the
[1:07:30] multitude and to his disciples saying
[1:07:33] the scribes and the pharisees sit in
[1:07:36] moses's seat
[1:07:39] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[1:07:41] observe that observe and do
[1:07:44] but do not ye after their words yes but
[1:07:47] they say and they do not yes so we're
[1:07:50] saying listen to what they say
[1:07:52] maybe i could say today they preach
[1:07:53] unity
[1:07:54] listen to what they say and do what they
[1:07:56] say
[1:07:57] but they're not doing it
[1:07:59] amen
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:01] for they bind heavy burdens ingredients
[1:08:03] to be born and lay them on men's
[1:08:05] shoulders but they themselves were not
[1:08:07] moved yes then one of their fingers
[1:08:11] they're not even going to try they're
[1:08:13] not going to reach out no
[1:08:15] but all their works they do for to be
[1:08:17] seen of men
[1:08:18] they may broad their phylactes and
[1:08:20] enlarge the borders of their garments
[1:08:22] they love the uppermost rooms at the
[1:08:24] feasts and the chief seats in the
[1:08:26] synagogues and greetings in the market
[1:08:28] and to be called the men rabbi rabbi
[1:08:31] but be not called rabbi
[1:08:35] for one is your master even christ
[1:08:38] and ye are all brethren amen
[1:08:41] a love for that yes
[1:08:44] now god might
[1:08:45] give a variety of gifts
[1:08:48] different different gifts to us and each
[1:08:49] of us have different roles but he uses
[1:08:52] all of these gifts into in into one
[1:08:55] body
[1:08:56] we can't i can't be a brother bennett
[1:08:58] but then it can be me that's right we
[1:09:00] each have our gifts and we if we can
[1:09:03] apply those gifts to the unity of the
[1:09:05] body yes then we will make
[1:09:08] we'll make progress yes
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:12] so jesus
[1:09:13] time was getting laid in his ministry
[1:09:16] it was the last week
[1:09:18] that he
[1:09:19] would be alive in his mortal flesh
[1:09:24] goes he comes in
[1:09:25] to the city on sunday
[1:09:27] like a triumphant king
[1:09:30] he was on the donkey and people were
[1:09:32] throwing palm leaves down and throwing
[1:09:34] their garments in front of the donkey
[1:09:35] they were they were rejoicing over this
[1:09:38] this king that was coming into the city
[1:09:39] they were waving their palm leaves
[1:09:42] they were so excited yes and jesus comes
[1:09:45] in to the city and he has a big week you
[1:09:49] know what happened during that week and
[1:09:51] then on thursday
[1:09:54] burton was starting to weigh on our
[1:09:57] little young man 33 years old
[1:10:00] the burden was starting to weigh on
[1:10:03] and he knew
[1:10:05] what was going to happen disciples went
[1:10:07] man this is great
[1:10:08] this is really good finally he is going
[1:10:11] to be put on the throne
[1:10:14] of israel yes and he is going to take
[1:10:16] the kingdom for himself they had it in
[1:10:19] their mind how it was going to be sure
[1:10:21] right but jesus
[1:10:23] brings them into this room
[1:10:26] and they have
[1:10:27] their last
[1:10:28] supper jesus starts telling him things
[1:10:31] and this is in john chapter 13 jesus
[1:10:34] starts
[1:10:35] telling them he starts preaching them a
[1:10:37] sermon over supper
[1:10:40] and
[1:10:41] he says things like he says little
[1:10:43] children he says
[1:10:45] yet
[1:10:46] a little while i'm going to be with you
[1:10:48] i'm just going to be with you for a
[1:10:49] little while
[1:10:51] and he says where i go you can't go
[1:10:54] and they're sitting at the supper table
[1:10:56] they're wondering what is going on
[1:10:59] what is he telling us
[1:11:01] these are different words that he's
[1:11:03] speaking we see the burden that is on
[1:11:06] him
[1:11:07] and then he says he says this he says a
[1:11:11] new commandment
[1:11:12] 13 34 he says a new commandment i give
[1:11:15] to you
[1:11:16] command me
[1:11:18] that you love one another amen as i have
[1:11:20] loved you that you love one another
[1:11:23] by this all men shall know you are my
[1:11:25] disciples amen if you have love
[1:11:28] one for another right
[1:11:30] that's a commandment amen it's not a
[1:11:33] it's not a prophecy
[1:11:35] in mark 16 he prophesied that these
[1:11:37] signs were followed
[1:11:39] this is a commandment yes this is
[1:11:41] something for us to do
[1:11:45] amen it takes an effort and then in john
[1:11:47] 14
[1:11:49] he's still sitting around the table and
[1:11:51] he's talking to his disciples
[1:11:54] and
[1:11:55] he's giving them instructions and
[1:11:57] there's things that they don't
[1:11:58] understand
[1:11:59] and philip asks him he says he says lord
[1:12:02] show us the father
[1:12:05] and the lord jesus says he says
[1:12:07] he says have i been so long with you
[1:12:10] that you don't know me philip
[1:12:12] he that has seen me has seen the father
[1:12:15] amen i'm going to refer back to this
[1:12:17] scripture in a little bit
[1:12:18] it's very very important
[1:12:21] that that jesus was so close with the
[1:12:24] father
[1:12:26] that he says if you see me
[1:12:29] you see the father he says come on
[1:12:30] philip he says i've been with you and
[1:12:32] you've listened to me preach all this
[1:12:33] time
[1:12:35] and you still don't know the father
[1:12:36] you're still going to ask me that
[1:12:37] question
[1:12:39] just look how close
[1:12:42] that the son and the father are now one
[1:12:45] i want that to stick in your minds
[1:12:47] because i'm going to refer back to that
[1:12:49] in a little while
[1:12:51] and in verse 16
[1:12:54] he uh
[1:12:55] he tells he tells them he says and he
[1:12:57] says this strange thing
[1:13:00] and they must have thought okay
[1:13:01] jesus is going somewhere and then
[1:13:03] there's going to be another jesus coming
[1:13:04] there's going to be another christ
[1:13:06] coming he says this he says and i will
[1:13:08] pray the father
[1:13:09] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:13:11] he may abide with you forever yes
[1:13:14] in the spirit of truth
[1:13:19] what is going on so he's not going to be
[1:13:22] with us and he is going to be with us
[1:13:24] and he's going to leave and and somebody
[1:13:26] else is going to come
[1:13:27] what's going on then he says again i
[1:13:29] will ask the father
[1:13:31] and he will give you another comforter
[1:13:34] what is going on here they're sitting at
[1:13:36] this table and they don't understand it
[1:13:39] doesn't compute
[1:13:40] what's going on yeah
[1:13:43] and then in john then
[1:13:45] he uh
[1:13:46] he tells him this he says
[1:13:48] don't let your hearts be troubled amen
[1:13:51] he says i'm gonna go away amen but i'm
[1:13:53] gonna come to you yes
[1:13:55] so
[1:13:56] they're still not understanding they're
[1:13:58] sitting at the table and then he says
[1:14:00] this he says well let's get him let's
[1:14:02] get up arise and let's go
[1:14:05] so they get up
[1:14:06] and they're in jerusalem
[1:14:09] and they start walking down the mountain
[1:14:12] into the valley
[1:14:14] and they're headed for this place this
[1:14:17] place this garden called goodson
[1:14:19] and he's got his people with them
[1:14:22] and and he's walking along and he's
[1:14:25] instructing them
[1:14:27] and he tells them he says again he says
[1:14:30] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:14:32] another as i have loved you yes
[1:14:35] he's repeating what he said at the
[1:14:37] supper table
[1:14:38] he
[1:14:39] keeps he keeps going down and they're
[1:14:42] talking and he says and he says oh and
[1:14:44] he says he says
[1:14:46] the time is coming
[1:14:47] when whosoever kills you
[1:14:50] you're gonna think that they're doing
[1:14:51] god's service yeah true
[1:14:53] this is gonna be hard in fact you're
[1:14:55] gonna suffer the same faith that i
[1:14:56] suffered that's good
[1:14:58] everything's okay
[1:14:59] and then they continue down this journey
[1:15:03] and they they didn't obviously they
[1:15:04] didn't understand
[1:15:06] these things and he says you're gonna
[1:15:08] suffer he says but but this comforter is
[1:15:11] going to come
[1:15:12] and
[1:15:13] and he's promising these things that are
[1:15:17] going to happen
[1:15:18] and that they get down
[1:15:20] to the bottom
[1:15:21] of the mouth and he says this you know
[1:15:24] we close in prayer in church
[1:15:26] you know he always closes in prayer in
[1:15:27] church jesus closes in prayer yeah after
[1:15:31] after he had he had the last supper and
[1:15:32] after he gives the sermon going down
[1:15:35] he closes in prayer on john in john
[1:15:38] chapter 17.
[1:15:40] and i want to read that
[1:15:43] to us this is very very important and
[1:15:45] this is what i wanted to get to when i
[1:15:47] talk about the unity of the body
[1:15:50] in john chapter 17 verse nine
[1:15:54] jesus has them there
[1:15:56] and he says let's pray
[1:15:58] he says this
[1:16:00] this is father in verse nine he says i
[1:16:02] pray for them
[1:16:04] i pray not for the world
[1:16:06] but for them which thou hast given me
[1:16:09] yes for they are thine amen
[1:16:11] and all mine are thine and thy are mine
[1:16:15] and i am glorified in them
[1:16:18] and now i am no more in the world but
[1:16:20] these are in the world and i come to
[1:16:22] thee holy father keep through thine own
[1:16:25] name
[1:16:27] those whom thou hast given me that they
[1:16:30] may be one as we are amen
[1:16:35] yes now i just talked about phillip and
[1:16:37] i talked about the godhead
[1:16:39] and i talked about how close the father
[1:16:41] and the son are
[1:16:43] they're so close that we as message
[1:16:45] believers the trinitarian group they
[1:16:48] they separate them a little bit not much
[1:16:50] they can't even figure out it's like
[1:16:51] well it's god in three different
[1:16:53] personalities and we as message
[1:16:56] believers we have a higher revelation of
[1:16:57] that and we say no it's the same god and
[1:17:00] he just represents himself in different
[1:17:02] ways yes
[1:17:04] i'm i'm my father i'm my my father's son
[1:17:07] i'm my son's father and i'm my wife's
[1:17:10] husband i have different roles but i'm
[1:17:11] the same person amen so we as believers
[1:17:14] we have a higher revelation we see how
[1:17:17] close this father and this son are yes
[1:17:19] are you with me very close
[1:17:22] all right
[1:17:23] so close that we can't even separate
[1:17:26] them amen
[1:17:27] we can't even separate the father and
[1:17:29] the son because the higher the
[1:17:30] revelation that you have the closer the
[1:17:33] father and the son are right
[1:17:36] so let me read that again
[1:17:39] it says this
[1:17:40] that they may be one as we are born
[1:17:46] that the people
[1:17:48] will be so close right
[1:17:50] they will be so united
[1:17:53] that they will be
[1:17:55] as close as father as you and i are amen
[1:17:58] we are not there
[1:18:01] we're going to get there i don't believe
[1:18:02] jesus would have prayed
[1:18:04] yes let's keep going
[1:18:06] verse 12 while i was with them in the
[1:18:09] world
[1:18:10] i kept them in thy name
[1:18:12] those that thou gavest me i have kept
[1:18:14] but none of them is lost but the son of
[1:18:16] perdition that the scripture might be
[1:18:18] fulfilled
[1:18:22] and now come i to thee and these things
[1:18:24] i speak in the world that they might
[1:18:27] have joy fulfilled in themselves
[1:18:30] i have given them thy word
[1:18:32] and the world hath hated them because
[1:18:34] they are not of this world of the world
[1:18:37] even as i am not of the world
[1:18:39] i pray not that thou should just take
[1:18:41] them out of the world but that thou
[1:18:43] should keep them keep them from evil
[1:18:45] amen they are not of the world even as i
[1:18:49] am not of the world
[1:18:51] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[1:18:54] is truth yes
[1:18:56] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:18:59] so
[1:19:01] i have i also sent them into the world
[1:19:04] yes
[1:19:04] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[1:19:08] that they also might be sanctified
[1:19:11] through the truth amen neither pray i
[1:19:13] thee for these alone
[1:19:15] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:19:17] me through their word there i am
[1:19:20] there you are yes jesus right now is
[1:19:23] praying for you and me yes he's saying
[1:19:25] for those that hear the word by this
[1:19:28] gospel by these gospels right here
[1:19:32] those that hear this word
[1:19:33] i pray for them also that they might be
[1:19:35] one so we're included they can't just
[1:19:37] say that that's for the
[1:19:39] apostles that the apostolic age ended
[1:19:42] that's for all of us yes
[1:19:46] and it says here
[1:19:50] and again he makes this statement and in
[1:19:52] glory which thou gives me
[1:19:57] i mean let me go to verse 21
[1:19:59] that they
[1:20:00] all may be one as thou father art and me
[1:20:03] and i in thee that they also may be one
[1:20:05] in us that the world may believe that
[1:20:08] thou has sinned praise the lord a very
[1:20:10] important statement and jesus will
[1:20:12] repent
[1:20:13] we'll repeat that in a minute and the
[1:20:15] glory which thou gave us me
[1:20:17] i have given them that they may be one
[1:20:19] even as we are one
[1:20:23] i in them and that would mean
[1:20:25] that they may be perfect in one and
[1:20:28] that the world may know that thou has
[1:20:31] sent me and has loved them as thou hast
[1:20:34] loved me amen and friends in reading
[1:20:36] that i really never did i never did see
[1:20:39] the importance
[1:20:41] of the unity i never did see the
[1:20:44] importance of jesus prayer there as i
[1:20:46] said before we always we always think
[1:20:50] of these these great miracles that are
[1:20:53] supposed to happen
[1:20:54] but the way that jesus
[1:20:57] is going to
[1:20:58] prove that he is the messiah
[1:21:02] the way that jesus
[1:21:04] is going to prove to the world that he
[1:21:07] is the son of god
[1:21:09] i'll read it again
[1:21:12] i in them and thou in me that they may
[1:21:14] be perfect in one yes
[1:21:17] and that the world may know that thou
[1:21:19] has sent me
[1:21:22] and has loved them
[1:21:24] as thou hast loved me yes that the world
[1:21:27] may know that you've sent me lord look
[1:21:28] at their unity yes look at how close
[1:21:31] these people are together look at how
[1:21:33] much these people love each other look
[1:21:34] how much they work they work together
[1:21:36] yes they have one purpose and by that he
[1:21:39] will know
[1:21:40] that i am the messiah
[1:21:42] people will know that jesus is the
[1:21:44] messiah
[1:21:46] we were amen
[1:21:49] we were
[1:21:50] sitting around when i worked for the
[1:21:52] voice of god
[1:21:53] we were
[1:21:54] the lights went out at voice of god the
[1:21:57] power went out
[1:21:58] and we all got together and we were in
[1:22:00] the biggest room we're in the big the
[1:22:02] mail room of course it got the biggest
[1:22:03] room
[1:22:05] you know the big room there that there's
[1:22:06] there's the benches and all of us
[1:22:09] employees were
[1:22:10] in there because
[1:22:11] the lights were out you know we didn't
[1:22:13] have anything to do our computers were
[1:22:14] all
[1:22:15] so brother joseph
[1:22:17] and brother billy paul were sitting on
[1:22:20] on one of the tables
[1:22:22] and we're all just kind of
[1:22:24] fellowshipping in there and brother
[1:22:25] joseph asked for the billy paul he says
[1:22:27] he says billy he says tell us something
[1:22:29] about daddy
[1:22:30] tell us something about brother
[1:22:33] so
[1:22:34] brother billy says this
[1:22:36] he says i was the closest person to
[1:22:40] brother brown in the whole world yeah
[1:22:43] i traveled with brother branham
[1:22:45] everywhere he went
[1:22:46] i was always with him
[1:22:50] i knew what he liked to eat i knew the
[1:22:52] way he liked to drive and the cars they
[1:22:54] liked i knew everything about him
[1:22:59] but even i
[1:23:01] didn't know
[1:23:03] brother branham's friends from
[1:23:06] excellent
[1:23:07] how can
[1:23:09] can any of us say that amen
[1:23:12] he didn't even know his friends from his
[1:23:14] enemies brother branham and and many
[1:23:16] like my family was very very close to
[1:23:18] brother branham brother branham made
[1:23:20] them feel so good
[1:23:23] he encouraged them so much
[1:23:26] and he was such a great man in their
[1:23:29] eyes
[1:23:30] that many people mistook brother branham
[1:23:33] for the lord jesus right right it's an
[1:23:35] easy mistake to make
[1:23:37] because he was such a great man sure he
[1:23:40] made them feel so good he had such love
[1:23:43] he had he wanted such unity
[1:23:46] and they saw brother branham as this
[1:23:49] great man and there's nobody that could
[1:23:51] produce that except for the lord jesus
[1:23:53] they saw the lord jesus working through
[1:23:54] him amen they saw the love of god
[1:23:56] working through that man when peter when
[1:24:00] when the
[1:24:01] the day of pentecost had come and they
[1:24:02] received the holy spirit and all these
[1:24:04] miracles were going on peter full of the
[1:24:07] holy ghost was was would walk along and
[1:24:11] they saw that love so much in peter that
[1:24:14] even his shadow walking by them they
[1:24:16] would get healed amen
[1:24:18] and it was because of that love that
[1:24:20] peter had right because they had that
[1:24:22] excitement in peter that they knew
[1:24:26] that he wasn't he didn't have an agenda
[1:24:27] he didn't have a he didn't have his own
[1:24:29] sermon to preach he wanted jesus christ
[1:24:32] yes he wanted to preach jesus christ to
[1:24:34] the people and that's what worked that's
[1:24:37] what made it happen praise the lord yes
[1:24:40] verse number
[1:24:41] number 24. jesus continues his prayer
[1:24:45] he says this father
[1:24:47] i will that they also whom thou has
[1:24:48] given me be with me where i am yes
[1:24:52] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:24:55] has given me for thou loveth me before
[1:24:57] the foundation of the word how sweet
[1:25:00] that jesus calls his prayers praise the
[1:25:01] lord he closes his praises father i love
[1:25:03] them so much wherever i am i want them
[1:25:06] to yes amen our righteous father the
[1:25:10] world hath not known me but i have known
[1:25:12] thee and these have known
[1:25:13] that thou has sent me and i have
[1:25:15] declared unto them thy name and will
[1:25:18] declare it
[1:25:19] that they love
[1:25:21] that the love where until thou hast
[1:25:24] loved me maybe in them and i am yes not
[1:25:28] because of the miracles not because the
[1:25:30] great doctrines not because of the seven
[1:25:32] seals not because of the ages not
[1:25:34] because the third poll not because of
[1:25:35] those things but because of the love
[1:25:38] that christ had for us and the unity
[1:25:40] that we have with each other every love
[1:25:42] that we have with each other
[1:25:44] imagine if we
[1:25:45] could work together as a body
[1:25:48] my body my feet have a different role
[1:25:50] than my hands do imagine if we could
[1:25:52] work together just as a little group
[1:25:54] that we are imagine what we could
[1:25:56] accomplish if it was in perfect harmony
[1:25:58] amen it was in perfect harmony at the
[1:26:01] day of pentecost they had they were in
[1:26:02] one mind and one accord they went out 3
[1:26:05] 000 people 5 000 people came thousands
[1:26:07] of people came to know the lord jesus
[1:26:10] yes there was a there was a brother

[1:26:26] to brother brown's ministry and
[1:26:29] this brother called up voice of god he's
[1:26:31] a tapes only
[1:26:33] that
[1:26:34] that group yeah and i call them
[1:26:35] denominations and that probably offends
[1:26:37] people but it is it's a separation sure
[1:26:40] and and you have you have this tapes
[1:26:42] only group
[1:26:43] and they call they called and he wanted
[1:26:46] to put up a billboard in his city

[1:26:52] there's there's we have a picture of an
[1:26:54] apple up there and it says on there the
[1:26:56] original sin
[1:26:59] and anytime you put something like that
[1:27:01] up of course you know they're going to
[1:27:02] go on and type in the message okay what
[1:27:04] does this mean so he said you know what

[1:27:13] we'll get it uploaded to the billboard
[1:27:15] company and they'll get it up there
[1:27:17] so they uh he did that we put we put the
[1:27:20] billboard up this church sponsored it
[1:27:23] and
[1:27:25] i get a phone call from another pastor
[1:27:27] in this city
[1:27:28] that city's like tucson there's a whole
[1:27:30] bunch of churches
[1:27:32] from another message pastor
[1:27:35] and he says what are you guys doing
[1:27:37] he says you put up a billboard in my
[1:27:39] city he says it's like one block from my
[1:27:41] church
[1:27:42] he says he says he says you know i don't
[1:27:45] appreciate that he says he says
[1:27:47] we have to answer these questions and
[1:27:48] all that i said well brother i said
[1:27:50] you know just settle down. i said
[1:27:54] those questions actually come to us
[1:27:56] and then we send out lists of churches
[1:27:58] if people want to go to churches he says
[1:28:00] he says you you won't suffer the
[1:28:02] persecution he says we suffer the
[1:28:04] persecution for putting stuff like that
[1:28:05] there up there like that so we had a
[1:28:07] spirited conversation
[1:28:09] it wasn't it wasn't uh
[1:28:12] hostile spirit so
[1:28:14] yeah
[1:28:15] so
[1:28:15] we we talked we talked for a little
[1:28:17] while
[1:28:19] and
[1:28:21] then
[1:28:22] a few days later
[1:28:24] i get contacted from a lady
[1:28:27] in the same city
[1:28:29] and she says saw your billboard
[1:28:31] the message.com
[1:28:33] she said
[1:28:34] so you're saying
[1:28:37] that the serpent
[1:28:39] and eve
[1:28:41] had relations
[1:28:43] i was like okay here we go
[1:28:45] the biggest criticism that brother
[1:28:47] branham's message gets
[1:28:49] from the outside is the serpenty doctor
[1:28:53] he's like well yeah you know and i went
[1:28:55] into genesis chapter three and explained
[1:28:57] explain these different these different
[1:28:59] scriptures
[1:29:00] and then she comes back
[1:29:02] and she says
[1:29:04] ever since i read that in the bible
[1:29:06] not from your website
[1:29:09] but ever since i read that in the bible
[1:29:12] i knew
[1:29:13] that that was the case
[1:29:15] i knew exactly what this was and she
[1:29:18] says i want to go to a church that
[1:29:21] teaches this type of doctrine that has
[1:29:23] this type of revelation
[1:29:25] and she said so i read the rest of your
[1:29:27] website and she goes she says i got to
[1:29:29] the baptism part
[1:29:31] and she says i was baptized and she used
[1:29:33] the word titles she says i was baptized
[1:29:35] in the titles of the father son and holy
[1:29:38] spirit
[1:29:39] she said i need to be baptized right i
[1:29:42] need to be baptized in the name amen
[1:29:44] jesus christ
[1:29:45] so you know what i did i sent her a list
[1:29:48] of churches in her area
[1:29:52] and she said that church right there she
[1:29:55] says is just a couple blocks from my
[1:29:57] house
[1:29:58] god has a sense of humor
[1:30:03] she went to the church
[1:30:05] of the pastor that was so upset
[1:30:08] with that billboard and by the grace of
[1:30:10] god that pastor baptized her in the name
[1:30:12] of jesus amen amen as far as i know she
[1:30:15] still attends that church praise the
[1:30:16] lord imagine if we could work in that
[1:30:18] unity yes that god doesn't have to force
[1:30:20] it to us right but imagine if we could
[1:30:22] work in the unity of the gospel like
[1:30:25] that amen then we would accomplish
[1:30:27] something then things would start to
[1:30:29] move forward praise the lord
[1:30:31] my aunt jackie
[1:30:33] you know my aunt jack jacqueline wheeler
[1:30:35] she's uh she's got cancer
[1:30:37] and she's struggling she's going through
[1:30:39] chemotherapy
[1:30:41] now and she's she's sick and she told me
[1:30:45] she said i appreciate just the
[1:30:47] outpouring of love
[1:30:49] from all these people
[1:30:51] she said they they've just they've come
[1:30:52] they've set aside any differences that
[1:30:54] we've ever had
[1:30:56] and and they've come and they've been so
[1:30:58] sweet they brought me food and they text
[1:31:01] me and they give me this love
[1:31:03] and
[1:31:04] she said i just appreciate so much
[1:31:08] laying aside any differences any
[1:31:10] churches and we're just all together in
[1:31:12] unity
[1:31:13] and i told her i said you know what's
[1:31:14] sad i said it's sad
[1:31:17] that it takes sick adversity right it's
[1:31:19] it's sad that it takes adversity yeah to
[1:31:22] bring us together
[1:31:23] it's sad but it's it's a god who is rich
[1:31:25] in mercy that will do it yes
[1:31:28] but it's so sad that it has to come to
[1:31:30] that and it's always come to that
[1:31:32] throughout history and we think that
[1:31:33] it's not going to come to that now
[1:31:35] it's going to come to that amen but i
[1:31:38] want to get a step ahead of the curse
[1:31:39] yes
[1:31:41] yes i want to invite that unity man
[1:31:44] among the people
[1:31:45] among this church yes and i know i
[1:31:47] believe that you have
[1:31:49] but across them all right and then
[1:31:51] across the aisle to other christians and
[1:31:53] bring that unity together because there
[1:31:56] is coming a squeeze i don't understand
[1:31:58] it it is anybody else
[1:32:00] you know we we hear so much about
[1:32:02] prophecies um and and we all interpret
[1:32:05] them but we really won't know the
[1:32:07] interpretation of the prophecies until
[1:32:08] it comes right yeah
[1:32:10] that's that's when i really know amen
[1:32:12] you know peter was exactly in the book
[1:32:14] of joel peter was
[1:32:17] peter knew the book of joel
[1:32:19] and then at the day of pentecost peter
[1:32:22] was there and he saw the pillar of fire
[1:32:24] come down he saw people rise up and he's
[1:32:26] then speak in tongues and he says ah
[1:32:29] this is that which was spoken up by the
[1:32:32] prophet joel he recognized that he
[1:32:34] probably had all these ideas of what
[1:32:36] joel 2 28 was
[1:32:38] but when he saw it he recognized yes and
[1:32:41] when we start to get squeezed
[1:32:44] like my aunt jackie's now
[1:32:46] when we start to get squeezed we start
[1:32:48] to we start to maybe come together the
[1:32:51] lord by by his grace we should do it
[1:32:53] without having to suffer persecution
[1:32:57] but when we start to get squeezed yes
[1:33:00] when you take
[1:33:02] i was a i was juicing grapefruit last
[1:33:04] night
[1:33:05] when you take a grapefruit and you
[1:33:08] squeeze it
[1:33:09] grapefruit juice comes out
[1:33:11] if you take a lemon and you squeeze it
[1:33:14] lemon juice comes out
[1:33:16] so friends when we get squeezed
[1:33:19] i ask you what comes out of you amen
[1:33:23] what's going to come out of us when we
[1:33:24] get squeezed is it going to be fighting
[1:33:27] or is it going to be the love of jesus
[1:33:28] christ
[1:33:29] is it going to be going to be amen reach
[1:33:32] out across you know what i'm getting
[1:33:33] squeezed but i'm going to help my
[1:33:34] brother i'm going to help my sister
[1:33:37] these things are not easy to do
[1:33:41] when repressed when you get in a fight
[1:33:42] with your friend
[1:33:44] and you want to talk about it
[1:33:46] that's the time you get squeezed yeah
[1:33:48] let the holy spirit come out yes that's
[1:33:51] the juice that should come out it
[1:33:52] shouldn't be that root of bitterness
[1:33:54] amen when when we're when we're talking
[1:33:57] with with other churches or you know you
[1:34:00] see the pastors go against each other
[1:34:01] you see the denominations going against
[1:34:03] each other you see the people go against
[1:34:04] each other you see now you see you see
[1:34:07] celebrities on twitter and all that i
[1:34:10] don't know we've got to talk about it
[1:34:11] but
[1:34:12] i don't know i don't have an account or
[1:34:14] anything but
[1:34:15] they fight
[1:34:17] they argue
[1:34:18] you see countries against each other
[1:34:20] yeah you know you see democrats and
[1:34:22] republicans against each other this is
[1:34:24] the age that we live in yes but we need
[1:34:26] to overcome that
[1:34:28] we need to overcome those
[1:34:31] that root of bitterness yes that is so
[1:34:34] that is so prevalent with us amen
[1:34:37] let me uh
[1:34:39] i'm running out of time here let me let
[1:34:41] me get to uh
[1:34:45] i want to get to uh
[1:34:47] a quote from brother branham but first
[1:34:49] i'll maybe give you a little history
[1:34:52] i've heard of the azusa street revival
[1:34:54] in 1906.
[1:34:56] famous
[1:34:57] you know brother brown
[1:34:58] marked that day april then i believe it
[1:35:01] was april 9
[1:35:02] 1906 that brother branham marked that
[1:35:05] day that the laodicean age started
[1:35:08] and what it was is it was when
[1:35:11] the holy spirit fell and this this
[1:35:12] little group they started speaking in
[1:35:14] tongues and a revival started in los
[1:35:16] angeles yes they took they they grew out
[1:35:18] of their house they have a little place
[1:35:20] like this they started with a group
[1:35:22] smaller than this it grew and grew and
[1:35:23] grew they got a bigger church and and it
[1:35:26] just continued to grow the lord
[1:35:28] continued to bless him
[1:35:30] with with miracles and tongues and and
[1:35:33] it spread throughout the world
[1:35:35] and they they started a newspaper
[1:35:37] the apostolic fate and that newspaper
[1:35:40] was printed for free and it was sent out
[1:35:42] and it was telling everything that was
[1:35:43] going on in los angeles at this time
[1:35:47] tremendous revival was going on in los
[1:35:50] angeles in 1906 1907
[1:35:54] and then something happened
[1:35:57] that's that it started to fade
[1:35:59] you know what happened
[1:36:00] they started to argue
[1:36:03] they started they started to to to fight
[1:36:06] yeah the the leader of the revival was a
[1:36:08] one-eyed black man named william joseph
[1:36:11] seymour
[1:36:13] and and seymour dedicated his life to
[1:36:16] the ministry to the message and he
[1:36:18] decided he wanted to get married well
[1:36:20] the secretary
[1:36:22] she decided you shouldn't get married
[1:36:24] and there's this this little tiff
[1:36:26] between the pastor and the secretary so
[1:36:29] so it started this argument so the
[1:36:31] secretary stole the mailing list
[1:36:35] and she went up to san francisco with
[1:36:37] another ministry
[1:36:39] and you know what the azusa street
[1:36:41] revival died
[1:36:44] it died
[1:36:45] right there
[1:36:47] and it started to shrink because of the
[1:36:49] arguments that they had it started to
[1:36:51] shrink and dwindle
[1:36:53] and go down until it turned into just
[1:36:56] just a black church
[1:36:59] with just a few people
[1:37:00] and then
[1:37:02] seymour died and they couldn't even make
[1:37:03] the bills for the church
[1:37:06] and it's gone yeah and today i've been
[1:37:08] there today all that marks the azusa
[1:37:11] street revival is a street sign
[1:37:13] and it says original location this is
[1:37:16] the street
[1:37:18] because they argued yes because they
[1:37:21] disagree
[1:37:23] and they were probably all based in fact
[1:37:25] they're all probably based in truth
[1:37:28] in in their disagreements yeah but they
[1:37:30] couldn't set those things aside and i
[1:37:32] and i see brother branham come on the
[1:37:34] scene and brother branham comes on the
[1:37:36] scene and in the in the late 40s
[1:37:39] comes through and changes the world
[1:37:42] and you have people like oral roberts
[1:37:45] come out of that ministry
[1:37:47] a allen come out of that ministry t.l
[1:37:49] osborn come out of that ministry and did
[1:37:52] great things
[1:37:53] and then you see
[1:37:54] started to fight yeah
[1:37:56] and the revival
[1:37:58] ended
[1:38:00] among the people yeah and then we see
[1:38:02] our little group
[1:38:04] we see these great things were happening
[1:38:06] we had a prophet and everything was
[1:38:08] great and then the prophet leaves the
[1:38:09] scene and we start in our different
[1:38:13] directions
[1:38:16] it ends
[1:38:17] it's the saddest thing in the world but
[1:38:19] history repeats itself over and over and
[1:38:21] over again
[1:38:23] and here we are
[1:38:24] now in 2022
[1:38:28] coming
[1:38:29] from that
[1:38:30] and we don't see are there any miracles
[1:38:33] god's always done miracles throughout
[1:38:35] history so we see some
[1:38:37] but nowhere near what we should be
[1:38:39] seeing if we are the bride of christ
[1:38:41] where
[1:38:42] is the supernatural yeah where is it and
[1:38:45] i know people don't go there
[1:38:47] people don't go there because it's like
[1:38:48] well then you know maybe we're
[1:38:50] maybe saying we're doing something wrong
[1:38:52] or or now it's just a word brother you
[1:38:54] know and we just god is a supernatural
[1:38:57] god amen and the supernatural follows
[1:39:00] his word yes the supernatural follows
[1:39:02] his people and it is today and if we
[1:39:05] don't see that there's something wrong
[1:39:07] i'm not talking about a local church i'm
[1:39:10] talking about the body in general right
[1:39:11] the prophet said that it's the sickest
[1:39:13] body that he knows right
[1:39:15] what a what a shame amen and what a
[1:39:18] shame is that i i've talked about this
[1:39:20] squeeze that he is going to have to god
[1:39:22] is rich in mercy
[1:39:24] that he's going to have to do something
[1:39:26] to drive us together
[1:39:29] friends that's not i don't believe he
[1:39:31] wants to do that right i don't believe
[1:39:33] that he wants to hurt his people
[1:39:36] but he's rich in mercy so he knows that
[1:39:38] we're people so we have to go back we
[1:39:40] have to have to experience those things
[1:39:43] but when you get squeezed
[1:39:45] make sure that it's the holy spirit
[1:39:47] coming out yes right not something not
[1:39:49] something else amen yes
[1:39:52] do we pray as jesus prayed
[1:39:55] so what do we do
[1:39:57] you know how how can how can we get get
[1:39:59] further
[1:40:00] and one thing is we can pray for it
[1:40:03] if it meant so much to jesus that over
[1:40:06] and over and over he prayed for it over
[1:40:09] and over he told his disciples then the
[1:40:11] disciples come the apostles come
[1:40:13] first corinthians chapter 13 first
[1:40:16] corinthians chapter one uh first second
[1:40:19] third john first and second peter all of
[1:40:22] it
[1:40:23] often all the time love one another amen
[1:40:25] unity
[1:40:27] and then these other things are smaller
[1:40:29] this unity is huge
[1:40:32] it's very very important it's important
[1:40:34] for our family that we get along
[1:40:36] together it's important for our church
[1:40:39] local that we get along it's important
[1:40:41] for our church's broad scale that we get
[1:40:43] along and for christianity in general
[1:40:46] right it's important remember there's
[1:40:48] one full and one shepherd amen i read
[1:40:51] that scripture
[1:40:52] let me read this let me read a quote
[1:40:58] and i'll finish here this is what
[1:41:00] brother branham said
[1:41:03] now notice he said this in 5701 25. this
[1:41:07] is a different quote than the first one
[1:41:10] different sermon
[1:41:12] now notice
[1:41:13] just a few moments i want to say this
[1:41:15] before i start preaching
[1:41:16] that the greatest need of healing
[1:41:18] tonight
[1:41:19] and the sickest body that i know of in
[1:41:22] all the world that needs healing
[1:41:25] he says this i'm sorry he says the
[1:41:27] sickest body that i know of in all the
[1:41:29] world is the body of the lord jesus the
[1:41:32] church
[1:41:34] oh it's horribly sick yeah
[1:41:36] it's broke up and scattered
[1:41:38] it needs healing
[1:41:40] may god send
[1:41:42] the holy spirit in such a power so the
[1:41:45] whole body of christ will be brought
[1:41:48] together
[1:41:49] bond with love and unity yes
[1:41:53] now listen to this
[1:41:55] until then
[1:41:58] until then you will see things happen
[1:42:01] that you never thought
[1:42:02] of before yes
[1:42:05] until then you will see things happen
[1:42:07] that you never thought of before jesus
[1:42:09] will come and it will be all over
[1:42:12] the world again may god send the holy
[1:42:14] spirit with such in such a power to the
[1:42:16] whole body of christ will be brought
[1:42:17] together
[1:42:18] bound with love and unity and until then
[1:42:20] and
[1:42:21] then you will see things happen that you
[1:42:24] never thought of before jesus will come
[1:42:26] and it will be all over so now we have
[1:42:28] another prophet
[1:42:29] saying
[1:42:31] be together
[1:42:32] be together and by this
[1:42:35] not only will men don't know your you're
[1:42:36] my disciples but by this also that you
[1:42:39] will know that i am the christ amen if
[1:42:42] you have loved one for another and you
[1:42:43] have unity
[1:42:45] and i do not believe
[1:42:47] i believe that we do not put enough
[1:42:49] emphasis on that
[1:42:51] we talk about things of life we talk
[1:42:53] about about about great prophecies that
[1:42:56] are supposed to happen but unity of them
[1:42:59] among the body should be paramount yes
[1:43:02] and it takes an effort we need to do
[1:43:04] something it was a commandment from
[1:43:05] jesus it was not a prophecy it was a
[1:43:07] commandment amen that we should love one
[1:43:09] another and have that unity
[1:43:11] are you with me friend yes
[1:43:15] are you gonna make an effort to do it
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:27] i'm going to ask the pastor to close but
[1:43:29] about let's bow our heads and let's
[1:43:31] stand let's stand to our feet and
[1:43:37] think about
[1:43:40] as we pray and have just a moment of
[1:43:42] quiet time
[1:43:45] think about the lord jesus
[1:43:48] coming down the mountain
[1:43:50] and the pressure that was on and the
[1:43:52] love that he had for his people the love
[1:43:56] that he had that he wanted to see
[1:43:59] among
[1:44:00] his children
[1:44:02] and then in asking the lord lord let
[1:44:05] them be one yes as you and i
[1:44:08] yes how close
[1:44:10] we should be with each other yes
[1:44:22] amen what a powerful thing it is
[1:44:25] amen
[1:44:26] love is the most powerful force there is
[1:44:28] on the planet today
[1:44:30] and the bride is the ones who have the
[1:44:32] ability to tap into it they're the ones
[1:44:35] who really have what true love is people
[1:44:37] talk about love they scream about love
[1:44:38] they mention love they say if you don't
[1:44:40] love us
[1:44:41] and blah blah on and on like you talked
[1:44:44] about the
[1:44:45] cover of that well you know we're
[1:44:46] supposed to
[1:44:48] they consider us accepting that as love
[1:44:52] that that's not love love is
[1:44:54] uh love is something that causes us to
[1:44:58] want that person to
[1:45:00] prosper and to be blessed
[1:45:02] and to not go to hell
[1:45:04] but to go to heaven
[1:45:05] that's the love that motivates us
[1:45:08] and that love will be corrective to try
[1:45:10] to get that person to recognize
[1:45:13] what you're doing how you're acting how
[1:45:15] you're living is not going to put you in
[1:45:17] heaven
[1:45:19] and that's the love that uh that our
[1:45:21] brother is referring to and of course i
[1:45:23] have
[1:45:24] a little snippet i mean belize you'll
[1:45:27] he'll enjoy the
[1:45:28] book two chapters on love it's good but
[1:45:32] anyway
[1:45:34] my my favorite thing in the scripture is
[1:45:36] i think it's genesis 11 if i remember
[1:45:38] right where they started to build the
[1:45:39] big tower together
[1:45:41] and even god himself said there will be
[1:45:44] nothing withheld from those people what
[1:45:47] they imagined to do
[1:45:49] just because they were in unity
[1:45:52] that's it they were in unity they were
[1:45:54] in one mind and god himself said
[1:45:57] there'll be nothing impossible to those
[1:45:59] people
[1:46:00] because they're in unity
[1:46:02] they'll do exactly what they set forth
[1:46:04] to do
[1:46:05] and what an example it is to us
[1:46:09] what a message to us
[1:46:11] to recognize what it would take to for
[1:46:14] us to bring us i think that's actually i
[1:46:16] was sitting there trying to remember
[1:46:17] brother dan i think that's actually the
[1:46:19] second message i ever brought up to
[1:46:20] tabernacle my entire life
[1:46:23] brother green called me up one time in
[1:46:24] the 98 convention i spoke about
[1:46:27] two most men influential men in my life
[1:46:29] but then
[1:46:30] uh i when when we came out and uh i
[1:46:34] think the next time i it was on unity
[1:46:36] and it struck a chord with brother green
[1:46:38] and he liked it so much in fact
[1:46:41] that book is a product of brother
[1:46:43] green's continued encouragement because
[1:46:46] i
[1:46:46] preached that and he said you need to
[1:46:48] write a book i don't write a book i
[1:46:51] failed english i think the teachers i
[1:46:53] had were sympathetic and passed me with
[1:46:56] a
[1:46:57] can you get a d minus minus i don't know
[1:47:00] i i can't write anything i can barely
[1:47:02] speak
[1:47:03] in fact they said they when i was in
[1:47:06] junior high school everybody was
[1:47:08] starting to take different language and
[1:47:10] the counselor came to me and said you
[1:47:12] shouldn't take a foreign language until
[1:47:14] you have mastered the english language
[1:47:15] guess what all through school high
[1:47:17] school i never took a foreign language
[1:47:20] you know why because i've never mastered
[1:47:22] the english language good enough to feel
[1:47:24] comfortable taking another language so i
[1:47:27] never did but it's it's something god
[1:47:30] did and that's what matters
[1:47:32] that's what matters problem is today we
[1:47:34] let the spirit of the world get on us
[1:47:36] amen about three weeks ago i preached on
[1:47:39] why we're not a denomination
[1:47:41] but we let the spirit of the world get
[1:47:43] on us the spirit of the world the spirit
[1:47:45] of the world says you're part of us if
[1:47:47] you believe what we believe if you speak
[1:47:50] the way we speak that's the whole free
[1:47:51] speech thing that's going on now
[1:47:53] well they believe in free speech as long
[1:47:55] as you're saying what they want you to
[1:47:57] say
[1:47:58] but free speech should be
[1:48:00] i'm going to listen to you because you
[1:48:03] have a right to speak and i expect you
[1:48:04] to listen to me because i have a right
[1:48:06] to speak
[1:48:07] but this is just the unity of the
[1:48:08] brethren
[1:48:10] amen the power of that is incredible
[1:48:13] i don't know that we even know tap into
[1:48:15] it i mean
[1:48:17] me and brother wilson
[1:48:18] growing up in the south we go back to
[1:48:20] days where we've been in ministries and
[1:48:22] meetings where
[1:48:24] it just the unity and the power of the
[1:48:26] spirit was so strong and milky white
[1:48:28] across the congregation and
[1:48:30] it just it's just incredible
[1:48:33] uh and just a little tapping into that
[1:48:36] that
[1:48:36] our brother ministered on today i tell
[1:48:38] you it's right where my art is that's
[1:48:40] for sure and he'll probably get to know
[1:48:42] that better when he reads the book but
[1:48:44] that's been a heart on my heart for so
[1:48:47] many
[1:48:48] well most of my ministry it really has
[1:48:51] it's been about unity and
[1:48:53] unity of the body i don't know how many
[1:48:55] times i've spoke on it but uh i think we
[1:48:58] just don't understand what the potential
[1:49:01] of that is if we just if we could tap
[1:49:03] into that amen and tap into recognizing
[1:49:07] we are to hold nothing against anyone
[1:49:10] right amen
[1:49:12] we are to hold nothing against anyone
[1:49:14] yes amen and by the grace of god
[1:49:18] you remember
[1:49:19] that little paper that brother green
[1:49:22] tore off and put a little mark on it and
[1:49:24] said brother branham said put it on that
[1:49:26] scale
[1:49:27] i'm not going at all the details but
[1:49:29] most of you know what i'm talking about
[1:49:30] they put a little scratch as he called
[1:49:32] it on that little piece of paper he put
[1:49:34] the piece of paper on the scale it
[1:49:36] weighed
[1:49:37] put a little scratch and put it on the
[1:49:39] thing and the scratch actually weighed
[1:49:41] very minute but it weighed he said if we
[1:49:44] have a scratch of ought towards anybody
[1:49:47] we're in danger of hellfire
[1:49:51] that if that doesn't shake us to our
[1:49:53] core friends i don't know amen god help
[1:49:56] us all but you know it's something
[1:49:58] that's uh that uh he talked about being
[1:50:01] so powerful and that love is so powerful
[1:50:04] we just tap into it just a little bit
[1:50:07] and i believe we're i i hope i pray
[1:50:10] we're getting to that place
[1:50:12] when god squeezes me whether it's
[1:50:15] individually or whether it's a group
[1:50:17] effort or whether it's internationally
[1:50:18] whatever
[1:50:19] each one of us need that god comes out
[1:50:22] amen amen praise the lord i want god to
[1:50:26] come out
[1:50:27] in every instance
[1:50:28] i hope he comes out so much he doesn't
[1:50:30] have to squeeze yes amen that's the
[1:50:33] whole point
[1:50:34] we had communion here a couple weeks ago
[1:50:36] and you read that and the communion says
[1:50:38] that we judge ourselves so that we be
[1:50:41] not judged
[1:50:43] we be not condemned amen
[1:50:45] praise the lord so
[1:50:47] we want to make sure that we and
[1:50:49] ourselves are
[1:50:51] in the position spiritually that we're
[1:50:54] pleasing to the lord amen and again the
[1:50:57] foot's doing what it's supposed to be
[1:50:58] doing and the legs doing what it's
[1:50:59] supposed to be doing in the arms the
[1:51:01] hands the torso the head the mind the
[1:51:03] hairs the eyes everything is working
[1:51:05] together
[1:51:07] nothing will be impossible
[1:51:09] to that body nothing
[1:51:11] praise the lord i believe that yes
[1:51:14] standing and believing in faith unity
[1:51:16] love amen praise the lord like he said
[1:51:19] we don't all have to be under the same
[1:51:20] roof
