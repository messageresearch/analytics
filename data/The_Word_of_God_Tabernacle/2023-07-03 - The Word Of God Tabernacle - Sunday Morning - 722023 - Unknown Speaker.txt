us conquers amen praise the Lord so thankful God is mindful of us amen yes he loves his children amen we have a couple of prayer requests to mention to you as we go into the Lord in prayer now I got a text from Sister Shreya this morning goodbye astero's family has went to Mount Lemmon this morning to spend the day up there with the family so uh please remember them in prayer I assume it's just archery Gabriel and Alice so remember them in prayer they just wanted to get away for a little bit and I sure can't blame him for that amen I know exactly we all do amen it's always nice to get away once in a while so praise the Lord sister um uh Norma puts a requests of prayer and please pray for sister Dorothy's daughters up in Show Low daughter's plural Carol and Dede Carol broke her arm and we'll have surgery Friday oh my goodness okay also Didi is in Show Low and is having a hard time breathing please pray that God will help the bridge did she move to show up or no because she has right okay okay sure okay okay so both Carol broke her arm indeedy show having a hard time reading remember that prayer also praise His Norm says please pray for my daughter Kathy who is sick with her lungs and has a bad cough but won't go to the doctor and so we'll go to Dr Jesus for her amen praise the Lord also I got a text from Sister Lydia this morning she uh had a hard time of sleeping last night having pain in her left knee and asked if we were to pray for her this morning she's going to be streaming so if you are God bless you Sister Lydia be praying for her this morning also amen appreciate your prayers for me the week went well my knee did good up and down the ladder a couple two three hundred times uh doing the stuff I needed to do for the job so thanks for the Lord blessed is still not quite a hundred percent um but the Lord's really blessed and I appreciate him that for it the temperature um it was hot it was hot and humid that heat index uh one at one afternoon that he didn't index made it to 113. but every day it was at least 105 heat index uh now hovered around 100 degrees but real feel was 105 plus every day so it was kind of warm but I I sweated quite a bit but thank the Lord I just I forced myself and made myself drink and drink and drink so the Lord helped us there so I appreciate that took a little bit of salt too so which helped but um I appreciate your prayers and the flights were really good the Lord blessed it so I appreciate that amen uh also I was remembering yesterday you know yesterday with was brother Green's birthday would have been you would have been 90 years old when I started thinking about it brother green would have been 90 years old yesterday uh so I I personally I still miss it he wasn't a perfect man by any means but uh he meant a lot to me Lord sent me here to help him and uh I did the best I could at that and and again I I still I guess the Lord just created an affinity there uh you know when you when you kind of have that bond with somebody and they have little mess-ups or something or treat you a little different way or something you can't help but still have such a great love and affinity for that person amen just that's just the way it is a lot of people leave and run and how goody and blah blah blah and but you know the only thing I can figure is God just didn't place that that love there and when I came here and the Lord showed me he placed that love there and he never left regardless of anything so um so upon that I do still miss him uh but uh I was remembering that yesterday so just remember these requests anyone to have an unspoken requested Lord knows all of our hearts let's stand to our feet if we could amen and on the Lord is mindful of every need yes our faults speak louder Before the Throne of God than through our words yes amen praise the Lord if I can quote brother green brother Dennis would you pray for these gifts Lord Jesus we come we come thankfulness and gratitude and love in our hearts for you knowing father you're caring yes and mindful and loving God here one is to ask that our Joys may be full and father it's we heard a theme with our the songs that we worship in your name this morning yes it is such an utmost importance for all of us to know that we've been born again oh yes Lord tonight all things have passed away behold all things have become new and father if there's still that old nature Lord speak to our hearts all of us include myself lick that old nature be truly did yes Father it's like the prophet said that you'll know where you stand with God when you're put to the test oh Jesus and God will always obsess these people you'll know what you're made out of when you're put to the test you put under pressure where would you stand if you find yourself standing away from God and doubting God and and then and going against God you have to be honest within yourself you need to have a born-again experience you need that closer walk father Yes you said in the last days to redeem the time for the days are evil and father this is the time to make things right yes God we know the enemies fighting us harder than ever before but it's not our fight it's yours amen but our battle is yours father and may you fight these battles through us for we're more than conquerors for them they are in Christ Jesus thank you Lord the Lord help us to recognize that for if we had so much think that we can help you along the way that oh Lord I'll do it no more I don't need you we're gonna fall a million miles shortly what it takes to be a real believer amen yeah oh Lord may we all like Paul said I died daily and brother Brown said my greatest enemy is William Bradham yes amen that we need to Die daily and recognize that this flesh needs to be out of the way yes when it's out of the way father we know it's your life working through us then we can be a blessing to others we can be a a advertisement a billboard for you that people can take heed that we've been with Jesus amen father bless each and every one that brought forth a prayer request Carol and DeDe and Kathy they all need a healing touch from you for we know the Lord our sister has mentioned these things and we agree with her that you'll we call it on the scene to me amen for thou am a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with the instructions are healed when we claimed the victory for for each one that I've with Carol Deanie and Kathy father that they'll draw closer to you if they lack uh uh they're a closer walk with you they lack an experience with you above all we claim and believe salvation for our loved ones yes Lord but our snake it's not he that starts to race that we see surprise but he then endures through the end yes Lord we're not there yet father oh and let us not be python thinking that I'm there already we're not there yet father help us to recognize this your work you started in US yes amen thank you

heart today sister Shelia [Music] amen both of them [Music] stuck in and out to me it's just smooth wow you've been to that border yeah right and no one there um wow thank you nobody coming across from Mexico yeah going across in the U.S you mean right wow that's really rare brethren what about all the people [Music] you know days of that government I have never seen yeah I've never seen so that might not be like a Port of Entry yeah yeah but there's usually even going through illegal entrance there's usually cars lined up trying to get in the United States legally you're otherwise uh so for it to be that empty that's really rare amen oh praise the Lord got it in and out amen God is good anyone else yes Mr Norman last month I [Music] was talking to her and she told me well you're doing great you did testing [Music] thank God thank God Amen she said amen yes and I went and told my husband about what he said I said no it's God remember that that day next day I was well and that was after the Lord the Tabernacle and anyways Satan attacked me and he attacked my digestive system and so last Sunday the other Sunday I was sick but today I'm fine and you know I just kept about it came up we got here a lot of other friends yes praise the Lord amen wonderful there are liver doctors now [Music] that's amazing it's so specialized um I there is a pastor of an Assemblies of God in church his name is Dan coverstone and he and his dreams come to pass started dreaming around 2019. and one of the dreams I'm concerned about is for real real close now I've hesitated on saying this um that so I want to ask you to pray about it but I he dreamed that people were going to something like a Fourth of July celebration and people were just cram packed and everybody was looking up and everything was going off and they were waiting for the fireworks but it didn't happen instead it started raining down bits of rags and burning stuff and cars were on fire and people were trying to get out of there they were up on a bluff over looking at and even they had trouble getting out so um they went home and and he had another dream in which there were holes in the ground across the border and people were storming out of the holes [Music] and and he's not the only one that streamed this Invasion anyway I just want you to pray about it about for the Fourth of July about the wisdom of gathering with people and and this kind of a thing you know they kept purging look up look up it was a diversion so they could do what they wanted to do on the ground so it's just a just a heads up that you pray please pray about your gathering this year and it sounds like tribulation to me so forth yeah we're not gonna be here for that but we're not good [Music] Wars and things like the Lord comes and so it's just a heads up yes praise the Lord amen thankful God keeps us amen let's stand to our feet if we could even see anybody else because you had some not little we'll just stand uh let's go to the scripture again now Genesis chapter 3 we're going to read uh just the one scripture that we've been reading when we begin these uh this on the holy spirit this part five uh we're going to get a little more in depth with the false anointed today and uh go to that the Lord willing so Genesis chapter 3 we're going to read one verse of scripture again the 21st verse but before we do let's just fire our heads for another word of prayer for you good Lord Jesus father we're so very thankful of your grace your mercy your love we thank you Lord as sister Matisse said and we see these things unfolding and Lord there's just no telling what's going to happen Lord blood to the horse's bridle and Lord there's been visions and prophecies and things even we know brother Branham gave and other things that's going to happen Lord but God wants this tribulation really strikes us through our father Lord we see the things going on now God how they are getting so ungodly but Lord we thank you God that you've given us the Holy Spirit father you've given us an inoculation you've given us a strong tower that we can run to in our state you've given us the Refuge the strength you've given us the Redemption you put us in a place Lord of safety and blessing and hope and Lord the reality is to us as a bride God we know Lord that you are with us father you never leave us or forsake us thank you Lord for this time Lord that we have here to come in from out of the world this place you give us Lord we pray that you'd speak to these lips that you would hear through our ears and that whatever your purpose is for this service today be accomplished God lord may you just have your weight and Lord do everything that would be according to your perfect will for this time of this place today bless these that have come Lord may you just bless and strengthen them those who may be watching Lord the streaming God may your hand be upon them as well we rebuke every demonic spirit that we try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you Lord for the testimonies and for your goodness and your grace in our lives Lord that we could continue to reminisce and testify of all the good things that you do for us all the time Lord but Lord we didn't come here for the fellowship we came here to hear from you and Lord that's our whole purpose of being here that's our whole purpose of assembling together here is to hear from you Lord and for your word to go forth empowering manifestations and to do it and accomplish that that you sent it forth for we ask these things Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen in Genesis 3 21 unto Adam also to his wife did the Lord God make coats with skins and clothed them amen you could be seated if you like now this um this service we're going to turn over and begin in Acts we've read it a couple of times here one a little more thoroughly than the other but this is where we want to base our service for today off of maybe probably next Sunday as well Acts chapter 2. going to read the first few verses amen and Kickstart bring forth our service from sort of try to where we left it off last week amen into this period of time like I said uh the last couple of times especially last week sort of venturing into it a little bit of the voice the false anointed um but uh trying to save back uh the real getting in the meat of it for this service or this and the next service we'll see what the Lord does so Acts chapter 2 now we want to begin with verse 1. and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen now again in taking the uh the importance of this message today from these two scriptures here from that little bit of Passage there uh that it that the holy spirit that broke itself up and sat upon each of them and remember and as a conjunction that joins the two things together it put sat upon them and went into them so it's an event that breaks two things together so it's two events it's one event of two things that's happening and the conjunction brings the two together so that sat upon them and if they were filled so it went on them and in them again as we have re iterated before the on part let's look at this because a lot of times we use different types of verbiage uh for for certain things and just in passing or just uh as we have been taught or learned over the years and we we call something a certain thing for a certain reason uh but I want us to examine this for a few moments so not necessarily trying to change people's verbiage I hear people talk about and brother random talk about being baptized with the Holy Ghost and I understand that the context of that is that that person is born again amen but sometimes people take that in it to mean something different than what it really is and that's kind of what we want to break down today because we want to really get into the meat of what it really means scripturally uh to be baptized and to be born again amen because they are they're synonymous but they're not the same one leads to the other so when we talk about when I hear people talk about I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I understand what they mean what they mean is I'm born again I have the spirit of God living in me so I'm not trying to change anybody's verbiage necessarily but I do want us to understand what we're talking about when we say certain things or when we hear other people say certain things so uh so in looking at these definitions if you will and you can go back and look at the Greek if you want to uh and and find it for yourself but the word on when it says is here now and it sat upon or on on each of them on could be categorized as as uh synonymous with immerse amen something that's immersed means that it's on it uh if I take this bottle and I immerse it in water the entire outside of this bottle will be covered with whatever liquid I put it in amen it's not going to affect anything inside the bottle it's only going to affect what's on the outside of the bottle it's immersed so on means that it's immersed in something baptized baptized that's why we baptize people by completely immersing them we don't consider baptism a sprinkling or a pouring or something of that effect like other denominations or other churches do they believe that baptism is just simply sprinkling water on somebody like a baby or something or pouring or something that effect that's why we've baptize because baptism means a full immersion when a person goes in the water they are come there to be by representation of the Holy Spirit here on the day of Pentecost they are to be fully immersed in that water from head to toe amen that's why a lot of times I I had baptized people by myself when I do I like to get a person pretty deep in the water because I want them to be immersed because typically I like having somebody else with me because uh usually when a person it goes backwards their legs tend to flail uh so I'll I like to try to make sure that person head to toe is immersed in the water so if the foot comes out uh uh that's a little different story but if you have two people that person tends not to have their feet come up like that because they're they feel more comfortable I guess so my point is the immersion the baptism to baptize to fully immerse uh just like here the on had nothing to do with the inside just like baptism the baptism does not save you about being baptized does not mean you're born again amen there's uh there's a lot of people that's been baptized even in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that are outliving horrible ungodly evil lives today you can't look at their life and say that person's Born Again amen you just can't so baptism we know is just an ordinance one of the three left to us uh but it represents something it represents first your confession that you're showing to the world that you're willing to be baptized because you've received Jesus as your savior amen but it also represents here in the scripture in the day of Pentecost when they were fully baptized or fully immersed in the spirit When the Spirit came and It Came Upon them it immersed them or baptized them in the spirit amen now it but it's it's only an outside appearance it's only an outside work that is done to smear or to anoint we can look in the Old Testament which most of the anoints used in the New Testament to smear mostly in the Old Testament where something is put on something or uh to anoint something is to just like Aaron was anointed with the oil it came and ran down his body to the Hem of His Garment amen which is a representation obviously a representation of the Holy Spirit but it had nothing to do with the work of the inside man it was only the outside now in you look you get to the next part it went on them upon them and they were all filled with the Holy with the Holy Ghost now if I took this bottle and I took the lid off and I poured water in it that's going to affect the inside amen that's going to affect what's going inside the bottle now it's not necessarily going to affect what's ins outside it it's only going to affect what's inside it amen but but when let's see if I could help explain this right if you take the day of Pentecost they were all the the Spirit came and baptized them It Came Upon them and they were all filled now if I took this bottle and I took the lid off amen which would represent death and to yourself and you take that lid off and you baptize it in water what happens to it it completely immerses the outside and it also fills the inside amen so the entire the entirety of the being of this bottle would be affected inside and out and the Holy Spirit does just that the baptism simply makes a way for the person of Jesus Christ to come and live in you when that Spirit came and it broke itself upon them and that Spirit came and immersed him God baptized them in that Spirit it made a way it brought about a a position of of the spirit of God to be able to come in them amen so that they would be filled with the spirit not just baptized in the spirit but filled with the spirit that's why uh I'm saying I'm not trying to change anybody's verbiage but I will tell you I have changed mine since the Lord has revealed to this to me many years ago uh and this and the context of the scripture now uh I I I'm gonna read more quotes than I normally read I you know me I I don't normally read a lot of quotes one here one there maybe none at all uh I don't feel like if you trust me as your pastor and you have the Holy Ghost that when this truth is spoken you don't need to say that brother Branham said and but but sometimes when you get in something that could be construed as as controversial as as this may be to some people that it's first of all derived from the scripture first of all first and foremost what I am bringing is by the Bible that's the number one thing but it's also backed up by what brother Branham said about it because brother Branham had to say it because the Bible says it yeah yeah that's why brother random said it so if I could if you pardon me a little bit today again a few more quotes than I normally quote to back up and see this is what the scripture says and brother Branham says this but he's saying this because this is what the Bible said he's only saying what the Bible says about it yes amen so that's why we get to what the Bible says now on the end we got the on immersed baptized Spirit going in is an indwelling inside or field to be filled again if this bottle was in the was dumped in the water or or even if you just filled it it would be filled that would affect the inside amen again if it was just poured in there it would affect the inside maybe not even the outside you think but the outside has to be affected before the inside can take place right amen so I hope that makes sense you understand that Phil um an indwelling presence or filled with something or this is my this is my favorite to be one am I Amen to be one praise the Lord now if you took this bottle and you filled it completely full of water and you sealed it shut and that bottle was never to ever be tampered with the lid never be taken off until it gets to its destination whatever purpose that might serve it will stay filled amen it'll never be one drop Less in this bottle until it reaches its destination and that's what Ephesians Paul says in Ephesians you are sealed by the Holy Spirit until your destination right amen it fulfills its purpose until it gets to the place it's going to amen now this bottle wouldn't fulfill its purpose until it got to the place it was going to but that's just a carnal expression of a spiritual application so just maybe that helps understand but when the water comes in when the spirit comes in him and you become one the spirit that comes in you and you yourself become one because the spirit of God sealed in your soul should go ahead and bring that back over here again that Holy Spirit sealed in your soul makes you one with him that's why it's called or means a new birth yeah amen it's not just necessarily a birth the birth itself is kind of a controversial term even Nicodemus is because he didn't have a spiritual Revelation came to Jesus Jesus said can I enter my mother's womb the second time good amen so the birth part could be controversial what it means is that God has come and living in you and made you a new creature because you and him have now become one you're one person so to be filled with that spirit makes you and God one the indwelling presence of God the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ the person of Christ coming and living in you makes you and him one amen now that that that double effect of the Holy Spirit the anointing and the indwelling presence is what makes the Fulfillment and the completion of a born-again Christian otherwise you just have somebody that's uh living by emotion or living by an anointing or going on a Feeling or propagating a gift of some kind but we know gifts and calling to our repentance right amen so without that it's it's just people making noise going to church doing it and and those things are fine I would begrudge anybody trying to live the life of a Christian going to church trying to live uh as best they can I would begrudge anybody of that but until this process of the spirit of God coming and anointing you and filling you with his Spirit to where you and him become one uh to be a born-again Christian it's just a confession so when I changed my verbiage I went from saying I was baptized to saying I'm born again that's what I say so there's but that's just me now somebody a lot of people will still continue if you do or whatever uh I've been baptized with the Holy Ghost that's I I understand what a person says that I understand it uh I just don't say that personally because for me I've been born again not just baptized I've been born again of the spirit of God that shows that that that that says that I have Christ Living in me amen I have Christ Living in me now let's go over to and and start with this false anointed part I'll go ahead and pull this over so we can continue to see don't know that oh work with it anymore but uh in remembrance of the trial being the body of the spirit the soul because that's the teaching of that is what helps us understand this whole teaching that we're talking about because these two Realms here the two Realms of the body and the spirit are subject to the things of the world but the soul when it's born again of God then it just has God living in you it's not affected by the world right had the world has nothing to do with your soul if you've been born again amen but it can affect the spirit and the body uh and even people that are of the false anointed of that will get in to that body in that spirit so let's go to Matthew chapter 24 as I said I'm going to read a few scriptures quotes Matthew 24 verse 21. if you have listened to the anointed ones at the end time a lot of this will be very familiar to you Matthew 24 21. and then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and accept those days be should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake these days shall be shortened for the elect's sake amen so what does that tell you that tells you that the election days will be shortened amen which State and sometimes it seems like it's gone on longer than it should but actually it can't it couldn't be because the Bible says they would be shortened yes then if any man shall say unto you Lo here low here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were uh possible they shall deceive the very elect now praise God it is not possible right for the elect to be deceived because she's become him the only reason that you could not be deceived is that you've been born again and the two of you have become one and he is the word yes and if he is the word and you become one with him that makes you the word well if you're the word you cannot be deceived right right because you're the word it's like I've said many times before you could never convince me that I'm a Chinese woman never why I know better I know who I am you there's no way to deceive me of that because of who I am and if you are the word then anything contrary to the word could never deceive you because you know better you cannot be deceived you could not be deceived any more than God could be deceived amen so thank God but but it is going to it will look so much like the real that it couldn't it would just seem to like if it was at all possible yeah what does that tell me that tells me that everybody without the spirit of God without being born again will be deceived yes yes if it's that close everyone other than the born-again elect will be deceived amen would the signs and wonders false Christ false anointed amen anointed anointed of what the spirit but false to what amen look because they are anointed of the correct spirit remember we talked about I'll read the scripture in a minute the spirit follows on the spirit of God fell on everyone on All Flesh so their anointed of the correct spirit but they are false how could they be false and still Anointed with the correct Spirit Well the anointing falls on the just and the unjust yeah but they're false because they're anti-word they're against the word amen that's how you know against the word They Don't Preach the pure Gospel of their day amen let's let me read you something here I told you it's going to read some quotes amen because remember power without character is satanic right amen power without the character to be able to orchestrate it is satanic so if God gave the power to people to do these things without the character of God you see people today that have all kinds of power in this world all kinds of authority all kinds of money but don't have the character of God well where are those people leading this place into what are they leading this country into what are they leading this world into Sodom and Gomorrah Armageddon the end their power but they don't have the character of God to orchestrate it right amen that's why it takes a born-again child of God to be able to be entrusted with the power to know how to use it control it only by the working of God and the Holy Spirit and the direction of God in their lives that's the only way they can do it which is the character of God Amen power without character is satanic now these people are anointed of the correct Spirit they're anointed of the holy spirit amen but they are false because they're against the word look here anointed once at the end time now uh he says Sunday school lesson try to bring this real show down by the scriptures uh not by the scriptures not by what someone else has said about it but just by the scripture you may say how can this be with the anointed ones where were they Christ c-h-r-s-t anointed at Christ means anointed one we know that Christ literally means anointed one anointed Christ's plural false prophets plural anointed ones but falsely Jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on these people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit he said yes sir amen yes sir by the scripture yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false praise God how are they false by the word amen that makes me wonder since when you look today I I I saw billboard coming down the interstate Friday in Houston going from the job to the uh to the airport the Hotel by the airport and I see this huge billboard advertisement of a church nothing against that you know very nice and it has a picture of the pastor I guess it is with the ear thing on in the microphone and and his posturing is uh uh like like he's uh giving a great speech like a lot of preachers you'd see today and somehow when I looked at that the spear I felt the spirit spoke to me and said when did preachers get from preaching the gospel to just giving a good speech to a group of people right it seems like nowadays all it is that people are interested in is it's going to church to have a nice a nice uh speak of speech spoken to them not the gospel priest down with the fire Brimstone of hell that caused people to repent and said when did he get to that place friend if you if Church came down to a bunch of people that that pastors that were great Orchards friend I'm in trouble because you've got you could never consider me a great orator but when the Holy Spirit comes when God takes control it's more than just a nice little speech or a little thing of teaching something here and there and giving a nice or the sky is beautiful blue and the grass is so green and life is so good and you are your own God and you just it just I I'm sorry for him and it just almost makes me sick to my stomach well let's where does it get to the place that we're to preach the gospel yeah to every creature amen begins to End season out of season it's not to be a speech but there's an anointing but it's falsely because they're not preaching the word yes amen look down let me continue yes sir the genuine Holy Ghost of God upon a person yet they are false now listen close he says and see what he said and they shall show signs and wonders amen you go back to revelation 13. amen the false prophet that calls down in Miracles and things that actually happen signs and wonders isn't so much of a deceived and very elect if it were possible and they are anointed there you go there's our word what was the what was that synonymous with a synonym it was a synonym of on not in they are anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost no reference to an indwelling presence no reference of a new birth no reference to Christ Living but an anointing he's God that's what makes them false christs they're Christ because they're anointed ones but they are false because they are against the word they'd rather preach some Seminary dog mother or their own idea or their own interpretation instead of what the pure word of God has brought and what it has brought to us for this day am I through a Vindicated Prophet messenger yes yes William Marion Brown yeah amen where is the word they were anointed I know it sounds very foolish but we're going to take time he talks about explaining this now to explain this to help people see it to help people understand it let's take a couple of other scriptures before I get too far on this now let's go back to Acts chapter 2. [Music] we'll read these couple of scriptures again and then we'll go back to Matthew [Music] because it helps us to understand by the scripture not just what brother Branham said look friend I trust him and believe him as the prophet of God I believe the Lord spoke to brother Branham and gave us the word of God for this hour and then what we needed to be able to get a bride out perfected and out of a and out of this world in a rapture but I don't take everything brother random just says I want to be able to find the scripture for myself right yes amen amen now if I can't find it or if it hasn't been revealed to me what did I tell you I take him put it on the Shelf amen and when sometimes that comes by the Lord Joseph said there it is I don't say I don't believe what brother Graham's saying unless it's just an error like he's 1965 but he says it's 1964. I'm not talking about stuff like that I'm talking about a real doctrinal issues in the scripture and I don't see it I don't discount it or say brother randoms wrong I just I don't understand it Lord help me to see this and where it fits in the scripture amen I put many a puzzle together my mom loved puzzles my sister loved puzzles and I put media postal together and I put puzzles together and there are three fours together I get a piece I have absolutely no clue where it goes I'll look I say this doesn't have the color of this it doesn't have the shape of that it doesn't look like this it looks like this piece comes from a completely different puzzle amen amen but then sometimes you start putting the thing together and put it together and then you're like well there's something missing here and you go look at the piece you set to the side and there it is and it fits perfect amen sometimes that's just what God does that's a carnal interpretation obviously it's more of a revelation from God the show said yes that's where it fits praise the Lord that's God doing it not you doing it that's God doing it acts chapter 2 now verse 14. but Peter's standing up now this is of course after this is the Pentecost but after the spirit has fallen and they've started to speak with tongues and knocking out the walls and people watching them and calling them names and saying they're drunk and but Peter's standing up with the 11. lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all you that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words now remember what Jesus told Peter amen amen remember what Jesus told Peter yes and Peter was uh influenced by the wrong spirit and Jesus had to say get thee behind me Satan amen he said Satan has desired to sift you as weak but I have prayed for you and when you're converted when the spirit comes on you you strengthen the brothers the that's what he told Peter to do now what's Peter doing fulfilling the word of Christ right here strengthening the brothers hearken to my words for these are not drunk as ye supposed seeing it is about the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come going back to the going back to the old Prophet Joel in the Old Testament Amen to pull that out to help them understand this is prophecy fulfilled this day that scripture is fulfilled Joel said it now it's happening this is what Joel said he shall come to pass in the last days when we've gone into the last days think again saith God I will pour out pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh praise the Lord so when God poured that Spirit out on the day of Pentecost he poured it out in a literal engulfing of the entire world of humanity itself amen not just in the upper room he poured that Spirit out on All Flesh now that anointing lays instead and stands and as a belt that's over this Earth for all Humanity from that time forward wow it wasn't just for those people it was for those who ever will and it's there yet still today and it will still be there listen this now it will still be there even after the bride's gone yeah there will be Miracles and things that are unexplainable according to the scripture happen after the bride is gone yeah yeah so that anointing will still be there why will this still be there because when the bride leaves God's not done he goes to the Jews yes well how does he go to the Jews with that same anointing it started there here it is we've just read the start it left them and came to the judge well the Gentiles are finished and gone it goes back to the Jews so that anointing still here praise the Lord it will still be here that's on All Flesh your sons your daughter shall prophesy your young men shall see Vision your old men shall green dreams that's a fulfillment of the scripture by that anointing by that Spirit now they did it here and they spoke in tongues but not everybody that speaks in tongues has the born-again experience of the Holy Ghost they have an anointing that's fallen on them you see people all the time raised in their hands what do we tell oh I mentioned last week about uh in in Charlotte and and the Bakers and that time that Tammy Baker said so and so that anointing was their friend it was so powerful on those people they took out their wallets and was throwing money off the balcony just because this painted up Jezebel said she saw ten dollar bills raining down from heaven amen it was an anointing right they were under that anointing just because a person dances just cause a person speaks in tongues just because a perfect person has a gift or a prophecy or something does not mean that they're a child of God right it does not mean that they are born again yeah amen because that spirit is on All Flesh that anointing is on All Flesh amen now let's go one more scripture and I'll then we'll continue on from there Matthew chapter five now Matthew chapter 5. Jesus says the exact same thing people want to make a contrary to Peter and Jesus when it comes to baptism I've talked to people as you may have about baptism in the name Christian baptism as if we recognize it as in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen non-Christian baptism is any other way but Christian baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you go and explain those to that to people and say that Peter on the day of Pentecost said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then they would say but Jesus said I Then I then my rebuttal is then how could Peter be saying anything contrary to Jesus he's got to be saying the same thing Jesus said you just don't understand it amen because Peter first of all had the keys to the kingdom of heaven and Jesus told him whatever you bound on Earth is bound in heaven so when Peter's standing forth on the day of Pentecost and says be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's Bound in heaven because Peter had the keys Jesus gave them to him right not only that but Peter right there freshly out of the uh out of the anointing and the filling of the Holy Spirit a person wants to tell you that Peter is now born again fill the spirit of God one with Jesus Christ and is going to say something contrary to the word the word will happen it's impossible Peter Peter's not going to say something contrary to just and people say well I'll just take what Jesus said well then if you take what Jesus is you better take what Peter said yes because it's the same thing and when you understand it by Revelation you realize that being baptized in the name of father son the holy ghost in the name is the Lord Jesus Christ the same thing it's not different well Peter here is doing the same thing when Peter now is quoting Joel he also recognized we can recognize and reference that Jesus said the same thing look Matthew chapter 5. verse 43. ye have heard you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you now this one scripture a lot of people don't want to have anything to do with it because we're too wrapped up in hating people who don't like us we're too wrapped up in getting away from people who may not agree with us we're too busy being angry at other people for things that we have no business being angry or holding grudges about but Jesus said Thou shalt love thy name or or he said you have heard it said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies now how many people actually do that yeah God help me but how many people actually do that they love their enemies my contention is if you love everybody every human the way you should with the love with the agape love of God you shouldn't have any enemies now there are people that may consider you their enemy but you won't consider that an enemy because you love them too much right because you have an unconditional love of God for that person how could that person be an enemy yeah amen amen now I'm talking personal I'm not talking scriptural they may be enemies to the word things like that and they may consider you an enemy and I'm talking about personally amen if you love them right but Jesus said I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you know how many do that do good to them that hate you now how many do that pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you oh I pray for that person that they die tomorrow amen I mean that literally what a lot of people's actions are are portrayed right I'm praying for them yeah but what are you praying what is your prayer oh bless that personal God help you know that's just that's just the work of the devil's things yes amen pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son s-u-n now to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust which means that the people that are evil Wicked demonic mean murders rapists drug dealers users politicians All the Above God loves him he makes the sun rise on them just as he makes it rise on me yes and you he gives them water and rain and sustained life-sustaining resources just like he does me and you amen yes that is an example to help us understand that God loves them too yes he does Amen that shows us how precious life really is life is so precious to God that we've talked about before so precious to God that every one of them that Souls were 10 million worlds oh praise God then if that's the case how can we be so mean and ornery and vindictive against people amen amen I I've literally had people I know back when we were in North Carolina come to me and say oh you know I think I'm just going to leave I'm just going to leave the church this is before we ever move to Florida this is in North Carolina you know in in the early 90s probably late 80s early 90s probably early 90s it's Emily and I said what's the matter what's going on one of the book right back didn't even shake my hand today I said brother are you serious with me now I probably didn't say it quite like that uh it's probably a little more discreet but so are you really telling me that you're going to lead the church because he may not have shook your hand today I mean honestly that has stuck with me so much that's why I walk from this Pulpit out to that door and wait and try to shake everybody's hand before they leave it that's honest truth not that I I want to too obviously but that that really you you see me screwed out quickly that's the reason because I go out there to make sure I don't want to miss anybody if I try and it probably happens from time to time but I try my best did not miss anybody shaking hands I thought that that I wonder why were you coming to church to begin with now the person didn't quit coming as why did you come to church to begin with I don't I don't come here to fellowship with you I love you all and I love your fellowship I come here because of Christ in the word amen amen if I were to choose a church I wouldn't want to go to a church that I knew preach the pure unadulterated word of the hour yes amen and that's it I didn't care who went there I don't care what the person looked like Orchard or not I don't care just preach me the word amen that that's that's the thing that matters but but it gets into this personal struggle back and forth let's just go outside and just pick a bunch of daisies out of a field and he loves me he loves me not loves me loves me I mean that's childish yes but that's how it's gotten to the place that he's talking about God himself made it to where he and his creation had all of humanity enjoy the Sun the rain and all together it falls on the just and the unjust when the rain falls the weeds and the tares enjoy it just as much as the Grain and the and the flowers yes just as much it gets just as much life-sustaining resources as it needs as the stuff that's supposed to be there a vegetable garden or whatever it is when God sends that water it's on all of it it's on everybody and it's still here and it's still doing its work it hasn't changed but we have to different differentiate now look let me read this trying to do God of service he said now now look I want to try to draw this comparison contrast before we leave today and we'll again probably pick it up next Sunday trying to do god without a service without it being in service he said now didn't I tell you and then you come uh he's talking about uh Micah in the scripture and uh the Prophet come up and smacked him in the mouth you know he said which way the spirit of God go out of me in other words uh let me break it down he said I want to tell you something Micah now this is the the the one of uh ahab's prophets uh that had the sign of the Prophet the horn and everything and all this they come forth saying all these things and uh stuff that obviously didn't happen uh were they ever held accountable when it didn't happen probably not a lot of things don't change either but he had that sign and and Micah come out one man against 400 and said their prophecy is wrong what I'm telling you is the word of God and what I'm saying is going to happen you can believe it or not and zedekiah I think it was come and smacked him in the mouth said where the spirit of God go when he left out of me and Michael said you'll find out now brother Brown's starting to paraphrase I want to tell you something Mike could you realize that I'm a master in the scripture do you realize that I have the anointing or the baptism as we would say today amen that's what brother Brandon that's his word do you realize he's talking about zedekiah but he's bringing it down to the modern day do you realize that I have the anointing or the baptism as we would say today so brother Brown there comparing the two anointing baptism same thing or the baptism as we would say today do you realize that I had uh said that um now brother Brown says that doesn't sound right anyway the prophet that the one of the prophets there that was against what Micah was saying the head profit if you will bringing false Prophecy with with Ahab and uh and him going up to battle and he said but brother Branham here the point I want to make this quote is comparing the baptism the anointing together immersing something of bringing together in an immersion amen be mercing together [Music] let me see I've got a couple more of these and I want to read to you I told you I had a few we'll try to finish this up before we leave [Music] things that are to be you see here I want to make sure I want to read this one first things that are to be Rialto California now I've got um I've got the Baptist this is the quote now eight brother bam says I've got the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said that's still he's quoting that would say that and people say well I've got the baptism of the Holy Spirit he says that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul down in there amen so what's he comparing that baptism of the Holy Spirit as being on the body on the spirit on the human spirit but he's come but he's differentiating between the body and the human spirit with the soul because the body in the human Spirit are subject to the world but the soul belongs to God that's God so there's a separating Point here to understand these two could be subject to the world but this Soul belongs to God and he says a person I got the baptism in the holy spirit that has nothing to do with it that baptism of the holy spirit is only a temporal or temporary gift for you the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing or the whole body to the word of God and the will of God and there the soul is where you grow up see then you become as you would a son or daughter of God by birth by birth in the soul not by baptism of the flesh but a birth in the soul that's what controls it that's what makes you a new person amen amen now listen um the rapture the Rapture myth so brother let him get didn't just talk about this or bring this subject out to in only the anointing ones at the end time he did it in many many other scriptures uh doing trying to do God of service was priests in Louisiana the ranch was preached in Yuma the uh things that are to be Rialto California so it wasn't just anointed ones at the end time in Jeffersonville that brother Brown taught this subject or tried to get people to understand that we're jumping and dancing and speaking in tongues and manifesting these gifts to think that they're that that was their solidification or their justification of being a child of God when it wasn't because he said they could speaking tongues all they want go outside and live like a devil well that that didn't prove anything other than a gift and brother Ram's saying now that's just a temporal gift that baptism that anointing that those people operate under is simply and we do too we enjoy that anointing as well not just them but that's all they have that's what they operate under is only a temporal gift it's here just for now it doesn't it doesn't do anything to save you it brings you to being born again but it doesn't help you go on a rapture because the token's the only thing that put you in a Rapture not an anointing not a baptism the token a new birth is what puts you in a rapture amen thank God I'm born again amen the Rapture now let me read this one oh certainly not they would not stand for that let me read let me see let me just start up here I don't want to I feel like I'm being in a hurry and I shouldn't be the Rapture let me just read this whole quote don't the Bible say in the last days there shall come false christs not false Jesus but false Christ anointed ones falsely anointed to the word denominational anointed but not to the word denomination anointed but not to the word dogma anointed but not word anointed amen for the word will be a record of itself it don't need nothing else it'll bear a record record to itself and there will come false anointed ones you got my tape on that anointed ones he said oh are you with Jesus oh they wouldn't certainly they wouldn't say I'm Jesus they wouldn't stand for that but when it comes to Oh Glory to God I got the anointing and it's the agenda and this is gentleman anointing that's why brother random wants the people to understand it is the genuine anointing he said remember K Ephesus had it too and prophesied so did Balaam have it and prophesy but that don't have nothing nothing to do with this inside now that's the point Saints that anointing baptism doesn't have nothing to do with the inside amen praise the Lord unless that was God's seed his Gene from the beginning predestinated you are finished I don't care how much you shout speak with tongues run shout that has nothing to do with it mine a customer can count just as much as any of the rest of them I've seen heathens raise and shout and speak in tongues simply a drink blood of a human skull calling the devil wow see you don't any of them Sensations things he said forget about it it's your heart and that word that is Christ praise the Lord that's where it is it's close but that's where it is the anointing the new birth Christ coming on and in being a born-again Christian isn't just having a baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptism that anointing is a temporal gift for us now in temporal let's go back to this my time's getting away let's go back to this brother random says when you I think he used a reference of speed he said that Dove takes his flight goes out on a limit awaits amen what is a temporal gift it's temporary right what is what is a new birth a new birth is permanent according to the scripture yes amen a new birth is something that you get Christ the spirit of Jesus Christ coming the person I just like to say the weather the way brother Graham said it the person of Christ Living in you that's how he said it person of Christ Living in you seals you in there is permanent until your destination till we go to be with him sorry anymore this is temporal comes goes here there I mean we've had Services here where we felt the power of God fall so strong and you feel that pulsation happening and going around through this place and you go outside and where is it amen well he's still with you we know that right but that anointing like that isn't there anymore what is it it's simple it's just a temporal gift for us that anointing and thank God I enjoy it I appreciate the Lord a new birth when brother man says a refilling now I know the word feeling is confusing but all he's talking about is a fresh anointing a fresh anointing there cannot be a refilling of the Soul once he's sealed in out the we've said that many times amen temporal gift that's what he's talking about a temporal gift is just uh seen heathens Ray shout speaking tongues drink it drink above a human skull call the devil Indian Sensations it's your forget it he says it's your heart and that word word that separates amen that's what brings the differentiation that's what separates it gifts and callings Romans 11 29 I was going to read it but Romans 11 29 the gifts and callings of God of God I know we always say the Gibson colleagues are without repentance but the Bible says gifts and callings of God that's of God or without repentance so yes they come from God when did they come from God when he poured out his spirit when that anointing came down the gifts came with it praise the Lord amen that's just the way God his way with us amen I know I'm getting away but let me let's see uh modern modern events make clear about prophecy let me go ahead and read it there's many people just can't believe it even Spirit-filled people I'm going to give you one that'll choke you obviously means a little controversial the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul brother Brown's thing a baptism of the Holy Ghost has nothing to do with your soul amen I'm not going to try to change your verbiage in other peoples when you hear other people say that you understand what they mean amen they're talking about a new birth that's my assumption and belief I want to believe the better rather than the worst that's I believe that's what they mean but the brother Branham said the baptism the Holy Ghost does not mean that he did not mean that you're going in and all doesn't have anything to do with your soul that's just the baptism amen modern events this is on the road he's preaching this in California San Bernardino don't have anything to it here's the inside now he's got he's obviously got this drawing out he said the inside you have a spirit amen we got it you have the five Outlets uh um well he's talking about body I skipped over a part body Earthly home five sentences Spirit the outlets conscious inspection reason memory love so for five Outlets of that Spirit remember in that spirit in that Spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost in the second realm of the human's being you can be baptized with that genuine spirit of God and still be lost now you tell me what that means amen can only mean one thing in my opinion and that's what we've been talking about yes praise the Lord in that Spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that lives yes that was ordained of God the soul that lives ah praise the Lord that's God's work it's the word it's the word that changes it it's the word that makes the difference yes amen the Bible says by their fruits you shall know them what is their fruit amen their fruit is their word yes it's what's coming out of them a fruit and a tree the fruit is what's coming out of the tree what's coming out of you amen people always want to think about love and kindness and we know what the fruits of the spirit are absolutely but what are you speaking a lot of times we forget of the fruit of your lips we forget about the fruit of your lips yeah is that speaking the word because it's the word is what makes the difference yes amen I'm gonna read one more scripture I promise I'm gonna close here first John 4 1 be loved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out in the world what did Brother random call this scripture brother man I'm called this scripture the word test he said it says try them he says give them the word test if they can't pass the word test then that tells you who they are yes amen that tells you who they of who they are where they came from I got some more quotes I'm going to pass them but maybe next week but the word test is what makes a difference by their fruits you shall know them what are their fruits are they speaking the word yes are they saying the word are they believing the word are they living the word are they going to a church that preaches the word yes amen because that's the that's the separation point it's not whether it's gifts going and all these activities and things but is the word being preached amen amen it's not something that there there's nice messages sermons preached but I don't I don't personally come to church to have my intellect tickled or something that's going to make me feel like I could conquer the world I already know I've conquered the world because he did it for me amen I already know the world belongs to me because he bought it and gave it to me I don't need to know that the sky is blue and the grass is green I already know that but I know in whom I believe yes and my redeemer living amen let the word be the separating point to understand because a person without the new birth now you talk about anointing the devil's Satan can have anointing absolutely be anointed bring an anointing have that go on people that anointing on people and be absolutely as influenced by the devil as anything else amen amen but never could be born again never could be that Spirit live in them because he can't live the word yes amen let's stand if we could amen it's [Music] the separate application of the spirit is because of the difference causes the difference in people to the word and not to the word a knowledge of the word which a lot of people have a knowledge of the word Seminary is preaching knowledge of the word there's one thing that comes that's an external force on the body even in the spirit that that is that is uh a knowledge but a revelation does not come to your intellect a revelation from God is not something that tickles your intellect or or is interested in even coming into the the the spirit or the body that's something that's directly affected in the soul by the soul or Christ lives that Revelation is what separates and the word that comes and and shows you that that you've been born again you are a new creature because it's the word a revelation of the word of God not a knowledge of the word knowledge is fine amen but there's a lot of people have a knowledge but the revelation of the truth of this word can only come from one source and that's God the word himself and that shows that word in you is what makes you that person amen makes you that person praise the Lord let's sing this course

trip God working with us from a different team found out I was a preacher I said man people gossip around here so I'm just kidding up but yeah and I started talking to him and he's from Alabama South like I'm and he started telling me things oh this church that I went to and grew up in and he said I don't care much religion I said I don't either don't care at all for religion in fact all that is gives people an excuse to think they're okay and go live like a devil he's just a covering that's right I don't care for religion at all either he said well the church I used to go to has gotten so big and they have all these other churches now and all this I said yeah they seem to forget that scripture where Jesus said fear not little flock and he said I guess so amen but that's the truth that's what he said yes but praise the Lord amen greater is he that's in US good or not greater is he that is in US the bride we're all wide not just here amen internationally praise the Lord amen I'm

somehow and be gone for my wife's birthday [Music] we'll both celebrate it sometime she's got one in 365 chance of getting it right so that's that's not bad odds that's better odds than winning the

to make it today amen uh I did want to mention to you sister Julie email me the other day she has chosen to find a different Church uh I'm not going to give any details I'll probably get stuff wrong of her reasonings if you want to know ask her that's all that's all I can tell you um that's all I should tell you anyway but she has chosen not to come back for different reasons which she kind of expressed to me but again I don't want to get those muddled up or whatever so if if something nothing else you can just let her know love her miss her ever if you do so amen but I just want to let you know I didn't say it last week because I just wasn't sure making sure time a little bit of time could go by for her to pray about it and think about it but I haven't heard back from her so um I just
