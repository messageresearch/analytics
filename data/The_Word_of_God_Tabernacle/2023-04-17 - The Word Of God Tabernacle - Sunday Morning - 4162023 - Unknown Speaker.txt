he's glad you're part of the family of God amen amen we're a part of an international family amen not just a family here 5151 North Oracle or Tucson Arizona not even the United States but internationally we're a part of that body the body of Jesus Christ and let's start with the course I'm so glad I'm a boss [Music] enjoy dares with Jesus as we travel this song for I'm a part of the family the family of God where you may notice we say brother and sister around here is because we're a family these thoughts are so near when one has a hoarding we all share the tears every choice in each victory in this family oh I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God [Music] four days with Jesus as we travel this song [Music] the family of God from the door of an orphanage to the house of the king no longer anal cast a new song I see from brags on to riches from the weak to the strong I'm not worthy to be here but praise God I belong oh I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God [Music] [Applause] Jesus as we travel this song for us [Music] [Music] with Jesus as we travel this on forever [Music] the family of God amen hallelujah thank the Lord Jesus so glad to be a part of that family amen amen praise the Lord God and I consider you a part of my family amen that's why sometimes we counted a privilege when the scripture says so but when we can come forward in front of everybody or we can ask to a text or a phone message or whatever to pray for one another amen because nobody can pray for you like a family member amen nobody can pray for you like a family member again whether it's real blood family or whether it's the family of Christ amen that's why we come forward sometimes and have hands laid on us in front of our family amen that everybody reach forth in faith and believe as a family for one another yes praise the Lord that's why it's so important to be a part of the family of God Amen thank you Jesus so glad to be a part of that family aren't you yeah amen thank you Lord does anyone have a testimony or something on your part real quick before we change some of the service I I didn't see it until a few minutes ago but there's a spirit of healing here this morning and it started with me having this song on my heart um I am the Lord I am you know the guy that healed me and I haven't lowered it your healer and I was looking up the lyrics this morning and um and then and it just uh and then I was sitting here and God showed me I've always wondered how Miracles would die even though I have your I've had miracles in my life and I'm sure we all have I always wondered how how did it happen and so I was I I was sitting here and all of a sudden the Lord said to me um that it's when he reminded me of the upper room that they went up there to be in to be imbued with power from on high and then he swung me over to how the power is in the blood and I remembered that the times that I've had Miracles it's been a while I've been waiting in the blood of Jesus Christ and let it happen and and verifies brother Graham called it the token that your sacrifice is received praise the Lord amen by his blood we believe it don't we yeah amen praise the Lord he didn't ask us to if we understood it he asked us if we believe it yeah praise the Lord they stand or repeat if we could amen I guess nobody else anybody else I mean to cut anybody off if not we'll turn in our Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 10 let me read a couple of verses of scripture here man I did not okay Sunday school went well I have not had a chance to talk to Craig about the the building behind us you had a facility behind us but I still intend to hopefully amen maybe you make it a little bit more private place for y'all to have your Sunday school and a couple other things we just see how the Lord does with that so First Corinthians chapter 10 just read a couple of verses beginning with the 23rd verse First Corinthians 10 23 but before we do can we just bow our heads for another word of Prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful again today of all the love and grace and mercy that you give Lord and for a wonderful week that you've blessed us with through this past week and keeping us healthy and strong for your service Lord and God when something may a little awry come you send out healing virtues for us Lord yes God you just move on our behalf in a special way and Lord there was those who weren't here with us last week that you touched and healed Lord and brought back with us to be here this week Lord and through the week and Lord we just know that your mindful of our every need Lord your mom to live even the very desires of our heart Lord and we love you and we thank you for it Lord we thank you for this place for these people Lord and those who may be streaming God may your Holy Spirit now flow through this place again with power and demonstration and let it be to us God that we feel and know that that power that strength that spirit is here with us to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think knowing that you are our God lord we're in obedience to your word and trusting you for the desirable heart to come to the house of God this morning to sing these songs to enter into worship to praise you to exalt you to expect by that believing you inhabit the Praises of your people to be here with us Lord and Lord I pray that you do now God through the ministering of your word to take full control once again and speak to these lips Lord hear through our ears and let it be accomplished what you'd have it sent forth for today we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we commit it to you now Lord in the furthest of this gospel the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 23 we'll read two verses let you be seated Paul said all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth you could be seated if you like amen I'd like to give a testimony uh that came on my heart as I was praying there because God does know the desire of our heart yes and God knows that uh that there's uh now this may sound a little silly and superficial but you know how little silly superficial things sometimes mean something to us that uh that we like and sometimes when they're taken from us uh uh if we we wish we had it back well uh there's a coffee creamer that I like that coffee made makes and it's the flavor is creme brulee they quit carrying in Tucson two years ago hadn't been able to find it I've gone stretches without it everywhere I go I look for it uh when I was going to California I found it I had a nap at an Albertsons in California so I got some and brought it used it uh found some in Iowa bought it brought it used it gone and this last week there's a certain grocery store in the midwest called HyVee and they and I've seen those stores where they would carry it so I thought well I looked it up and sure enough they had it so this last time in Springfield uh Springfield Missouri I went up there uh close to a place we'd gone out to eat and I got one of the cards I said I'm gonna you know go to the grocery store for a little bit so I went and they didn't have it it was not on the Shelf there was no sticker for it even I thought all it just must be gone now probably even the stores the the last store that I knew that had it and I walked out of the store and the only other store uh that was like that one in that whole city is all the way on the other side of town and so I said well Lord I guess I walked out of the store I said Lord I guess that's just it I guess you know I won't have it but Lord you do know the desire of my heart and I didn't think anything else about it because I didn't plan to go all the way on the other side of town or anything like that on Friday now this is Tuesday or Wednesday on Friday we left a little bit early from the job because we were done and uh we went someplace and I got to talking to my friend from El Paso about it and uh he said I I said well there's another grocery store like that one it's all way on the other side of town he said let's go we got nothing else to do I said no I don't really you know I'm dragging over there I don't even know if they have it they may not have it either this store said they had it they didn't have it he said that's okay let's just go and I wasn't planning on go and he basically forced me to go I said okay well fine if you want to go we'll go so we went over there and got three bottles of it they had it so the Lord knows to desire of your heart yes again it may sound silly and superficial friend but God knows to desire of your heart amen whatever it might be God knows so uh we trust him in All Things praise the Lord amen so that's my little testimony amen amen it took a little longer than I expected but uh had to give you a little bit of background but the Lord Lord had it there just for me so praise the Lord amen now let's get back to the scripture it's a probably a premier scripture most of us have read it uh that he spoke to the Corinthian Church he said all things now look because I want to get to this the subject I want to talk about today is the edifying uh edifying now look Paul said here all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient where all things are not profitable all things are not for my betterment he said I might be able to do all things or these things that he's talking about that's not sinful of course all these things they may be things that I can do but not all these things that I that I can or am allowed to do is profitable for me so then it becomes the question if it's not profitable for me then he goes on to say all things are lawful for me but all things edify not amen not all things are edifying right so then it then it becomes another question if it's I I can do all things but not all things are profitable I can do all things but not all things are edifying and if you look at the word edify we've talked about this before but the word edify is to build up uh is to increase is it it is to grow up it's like uh it's like uh a child that is born a child that is born uh as it life goes on and it learns things it begins to grow up it gets older it learns how to reach out it learns how to speak it his eyes clear up to it can see better and and all and as it grows up it continues to get older and older and and it's able to do things that a a regular adult human is well it's no less that with a Christian a Christian is born and has a new birth and when that is born then uh then it begins the process of building up and growing up and getting mature and becoming a mature Christian doesn't happen instantaneously it does just because you get the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you're instantaneously a mature Christian there's a growth that takes place a promoting and Paul's saying I can do all things but not all things are going to be profitable for me not all things are going to be edifying to me so then it becomes the question if it's going to be something that is coming to promote edifying is to promote our Christian virtues in life if it's not doing that then why do we do it amen Paul is Paul is identifying here the difference and say yes I can do this but is it profitable for me to do it yes I can do this but is it edifying to me does it does it Build Me Up does it does it increase me in the body of Christ that is does it increase my faith uh you know back 25 years ago or so in the 90s I believe it was you went everywhere especially in North Carolina I don't know about here we were living in North Carolina in the 90s and of course it's in the Bible Belt and and all and people are a little more forward with their Christianity and you could go everywhere and you could find hundreds of people at a Walmart with a bracelet on and this little this little rubber bracelet had wwjd on it yeah which meant what would Jesus do and you hardly ever see him I I don't see any anymore actually uh much less people actually very few and far between actually trying to act like and do what Christ would do and it become a slogan and unfortunately that's all it was for most people it was just a slogan that kind of raised up and died out as quickly as it raised up but the truth of that is is really a truth what is it that I do that that is edifying when you when you start making your decisions or when we make decisions in life and the things that we do in the places we go and the premier questions should be come to us is it edifying to me does this increase my faith does this increase my walk with the Lord does this bring me closer to God and whatever it is it can it can be almost anything in life to try to uh not impulse but there's always something behind what we do Lord is this something that's going to edify me amen is it something that's going to be profitable to me so the cry then becomes how is this going to make me better if I do this how is it going to make you better if I act like this if I listen to this if I go here if I do this if I watch this is it going to make me better amen because there's a lot of things we do in life that just basically it's like eating a rice cake it's tasteless it's useless it means and does nothing so there's a lot of things we can do that are like that but there's a lot of things that that that actually are uh that take our faith down amen there's things we can do that actually will draw us more away from God so then again the question that I'm asking this morning that I felt compelled to ask is when we enter these things in life and it's every day of end it is life it is life itself our minds are always moving our our uh uh you had to make a decision to come to church this morning and I pray and trust your decision was based on what brother Pat prayed amen we had a choice and we decided that we're going to go to church why did you decide to do that because you had a choice now there's obviously something the holy spirit that compels you but you still had a choice you still had a decision is this going to make me better is this going to bring me closer to God is this going to increase my faith is this going to make me more like the person that I really want to be see I'm afraid sometimes and I'm speaking in general not to me or us or our church but in general and and I'm sure the question does come up with with all of us at times because we all fight the same devil it's not can I get away with it uh not can I do it and get by with it uh it's the question has become not can I get away with it but is this helping me yeah is this edifying me is this going to build me up and increase me in the Lord and then it becomes a bigger a bigger decision because it not only because my main my main focus today now I'm going to get on the other part of edification uh not just for us but for those around us because in the next question then becomes how is this going to help those around me better yes but see the people around you can't get any better if you're not better it's like the Bible says you know uh uh charity begineth at home how can you help somebody else if you need help yourself right right you know I I could see somebody come through the door and and uh need ten dollars and I said I'm gonna give you ten dollars but you don't have ten dollars how can I give them how can I help them with 10 bucks if I don't even have ten dollars it doesn't work that way amen amen I believe if the Lord leads you obviously in the direction to do that it may be your last ten but you'll have it to give right but see the question is if I and my decisions are edifying to me and increasing my faith and building my life up to a place of the mature Christian that Jesus said be thou perfect man perfect is not sinless it is mature adult Christian if that's where Christ wants us to be then what if what we are doing should bring us continually to that place amen then those that are around us can be edified by us as well those around us can be blessed amen it's hard to it's it's hard to bless somebody when you're not blessed yourself it's hard to help and edify somebody increase somebody when you yourself need to be blessed increased uplifted so it becomes the question and is what I'm doing helping me become better not not uh can I get by with this not can I get away with this but it is what I'm thinking of what I'm doing is helping me become better right amen and by better again I mean more christ-like more of a Christian increasing my faith and helping me get closer to God that's what becomes a question amen and I hope I hope that question becomes Paramount because it should be an essential question to all of us I I don't think that Paul wrote that for no reason Paul told him I could because remember the Corinthian Church needed the most correction and I know that when Paul goes to the Corinthian Church he's probably found a mess and he's found people doing this going here and doing that believing this and believing that and basically saying you know all these things are lawful but not everything of that is going to profit me it's not going to help me it's not going to edify me so why do I want to concentrate myself on doing the things that are going to help me the things that are going to edify me the things that are going to get me closer to God yes amen those are the things I want to focus on the most in my life amen let's go over to Romans chapter 14. Romans chapter 14. verse 22. Romans 14 22. Frank yeah yeah is it coming through yes okay I can't tell it looks like it's pretty dim so I have to remember to change the batteries Romans Chapter 14 verse 22. listen now hast thou faith question now Paul's speaking to the Roman Church hast thou faith so that is an essential question that's a question every one of us must answer amen it's a question that we're faced with every day do we have faith hast thou Faith that's the question have it to thyself before God have that Faith to yourself before God remember as much as we try to help other people as much as we our minds are on other people and as much as we know the Bible says when you're uh when you're doing for others you're staring heaven in the face and when you're living your life for others you're staring even into the face absolutely but to be able to do that properly we have to be in the position that we should be with Christ first amen so so the question is have it to thyself before God Amen he hasn't included anybody he's saying you have faith have it to yourself before God happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which ye alloweth that condemneth now again that is that is scraping the line between an event that we do let's just say something we do of whether it is profitable and expedient or whether it's just something that's just a rice cake is it something that is really blessing us and helping us and edifying us or is it just a tasteless wasteless something amen so that condemn it now that condemneth is the same one that's over when we when we read the scripture about taking the Lord's Supper remember when he talks about Thou shalt not be condemned that means you won't be judged with the world hey man so when he says that happy is he that condemneth not judgeth not or be condemned not thyself that thing which he alloweth amen by faith you believe it I live my life by faith I walk by faith and what I do by faith I believe by faith and what I'm doing is edifying it's going to be a blessing to me not only just me but other people amen now and and that's not even that's not even the ourselves being blessed is not the focus you understand uh wait Our Lives aren't to be lived so that we're blessed and prosperous I'm sorry it doesn't work that way our lives are lived to help bless and prosper other people yes because if you live the self-denial life of Jesus Christ your life is going to be lived to help others not yourself right Jesus had no bed Everything Jesus really had was given to him he didn't have a bed he didn't have a place to see everything Jesus did was for other people he didn't do what for himself what was going to bless or or make his life better now and a lot of times when we do things that's going to help edify others it becomes a blessing to us but that's just the grace of God we don't do it because we know it's going to be there we do it because we know that God is in it I got I got a a a question by my barber a couple months back and we were talking about uh uh this nominal thing we were talking about Golf and John Yarborough was mid with me and me and John's like to play a lot of golf although I don't really play anymore but we were just talking about that and uh they there's another uh country Saudi Arabia that started in another golf league and they give these players to take them from this other Golf League they paid them millions and millions of dollars because they got billions and trillions of dollars the Saudi Arabia's got more money they could burn for the next hundred years and still have more money than either all of us put together the whole world uh and he just just throw money at them and throw money at them and and and I don't like that and I told him I said you know I just I just don't like it just this this one organization brought them in and built them up and gave them a name and now when they like that they leave and go someplace else for the money I just I just don't like that that's just personal thing I don't care it doesn't really matter but I don't like that kind of thing and and my barber asked me he says well didn't you just leave another job because you got more money at the other job I said no no no I said you got that all wrong I said yes I am getting paid more money at this new job but I didn't leave the other job to take that job because of that that's not the reason I did it I prayed about this I put this before the Lord and I asked God is this what you want me to do are you giving me this because this is what you want me to do right and I felt the Lord led me into the place that yes this is I'm giving this to you this is why I want you to go now that's the reason I took it amen just because God now has it been a blessing to me yes has anything blessed you to my family yes has it been a blessing to this church yes but I didn't do it for that reason I did it called Scott said so I did it because that's where I believe the Lord was leading me to amen and I testified to you the blessings that the Lord has gotten from that point till now amen so you understand it made the the moves we make we do to try to help and bless others now if those things if it blesses us of course that's just the grace of God that's just God's love for us amen when God does that for us but he does it because and then when everybody is sort of like it's sort of like a James's prayer when we're praying one for another then we're all being healed we're not worried about praying for ourselves or my foreign no more we're praying for everybody and if everybody's praying for everybody then everybody gets prayed for and everybody prays and we all get healed because it's a family thing it's not just me it's not just you it's it's every one of us is a part of this family and if we're all doing it together then everyone gets blessed when it's working right when the family of God is working right everybody is blessed and everybody is want for nothing and everything is is working towards God's Good Will amen that's the way it's supposed to be yeah unfortunately we had the hiccups of living in Satan's Eden and everything that goes on with that but you understand what I'm saying see it's a blessing to me it's a blessing to you but I live my life I try to be a blessing to others amen not just to myself but to others so that others might get to know what um uh what what that blessing is now look that faith have faith happiest he that could never thought himself in that thing which he alloweth and he that doubt is amen is damned if he eat because he eateth not a faith for whatsoever is not a faith is of sin that's when you approach something and you're like should I do this could I get could I get away with doing this could I well the Lord just just look the other way while I go over here well well oh God will forgive surely God will forgive me you know if I if I do this and but see what you're doing is you're entering into something without the faith of God behind it and what did and what did Paul say he that doubted this damned if he doesn't amen if he partakes of it amen and if that uh and if that's where God's moving then it becomes a damnation to us it becomes a condemnation to us it becomes something of judgment to us and what that does then then it condemns your heart first John third verse third chapter I think it is if my heart condemned me not then I have confidence towards God Amen well this is talking about the opposite of that then your heart becomes condemned and then you're judged already you're guilty and then what does that do that brings you down that doesn't edify that doesn't increase you that doesn't profit you in the Lord it doesn't obviously it couldn't bring you closer to God it doesn't help your faith right so those are the things that he's telling that we stay away from and that we when we do things we do it with confidence to know that this would be pleasing to the Lord Lord let me be pleasing to you whatever I pursue let me be pleasing to you and what I do amen now what that does let's go over to the first verse still in uh still in Romans 14. but I want to read the verse now or the chapter because once we've once we've established in our own lives that our motives our reasonings our objectives our for edifying of the body of Christ and I begin with me so that what I do is edify what I do is helping me get closer to God is helping me get greater faith in the Lord amen so then if that's the case then other people around me can be blessed and and I say me because of me it's just you us individuals when when you do that then you get close to the Lord and when you're close to the Lord and your faith is Sky High you can be a help to other people you can be a blessing to other people maybe they need a little encouragement maybe they need a little lifting up maybe they need a little boost maybe God's putting you in their path to bring them to that point because you and what you've done and with the word that's brought you to that place now we help others that are around us to bring them to that place amen look uh Romans 14 1. him that is weak in the faith receive you receive ye if they're weak in the faith receive them but not too doubtful disputations it's like people say uh it's like Jesus with dirty feet amen Jesus with dirty feet was received with doubtful disputations why because he was invited he actually had a messenger with a specific Invitational message for Jesus to come to this party but when he got to the party they received him you understand that's the part they received him but they received him to doubtful disputations why because when he got there they completely ignored him his feet wasn't washed she wasn't anointed it was no no welcome about that made Jesus feel welcome into that place and he just sat over in the corner Jesus with dirty because he was received with doubtful disputation people said oh yeah you're welcome and then no invitation no no no handshake no uh love your brother and then it becomes then if it comes to the place well that per they're not gonna last anyway are are they're this or that or yeah everybody it's all kinds of things it comes and brings and that kind of doubt it's the same thing in the world today look at the world today what is it that that I I just heard and and I don't they may boot us off of YouTube for this but I just heard that there that the that the government has started to crack down on the Catholic Church for being radicals now friend if they're if the government's cracking down on Catholic Church for being radical what do you think about us right if they call them radicals and cracking down on them now now see what they do is they're saying oh we're not coming against the Catholic Church we're coming against the radicals that's where they get away with it it's the radicals that's within the church or the radicals that's here there you know that people do the same thing in the message they receive you with doubtful oh hi brother and then they but but because you don't believe the way they believe you're not a brother you're not going to heaven and they'll receive you but to doubtful disputations amen they receive it they say oh what they do is well in their minds they they don't consider you a brother amen and when they look and say a brother doesn't persecute a brother and and people say well that that's not a brother they're not my brother they don't believe the way I do they don't think about it the way I do they don't see this message or this this quote or or this message or something the way I see it and I don't so they're they're not even a brother and then when you do that then you've isolated that person off and you've made them less than what they really are and what they should be and what they should be to you friends we should never do that I don't care where they go to church I don't care what their belief is if they're a brother their brother you treat them as such amen amen that's the way it should be now there's a lot of things I see or hear don't agree with but that doesn't change it at all it's not up to me to determine that point it's up to God but see it's a spirit of the world that does it they taken their identity it's even like uh again they may put us off YouTube for this but it's it's like the president will come and say well I'm not talking about the Republicans I'm just talking about the radicals it's the same spirit and now they're clamping down saying well we're not coming against the Catholic Church of course the president himself claims to be a Catholic I'm coming against the radicals and see they and then what they do is they take and separate you out and then they and then you become you become a Target that makes it okay for them to attack you amen and the same thing happens to the Same Spirit Same Spirit of the world same spirits in the church amen they separate you out that it makes it okay that you become a Target someone to be attacked someone to be talked about or put down or instead of edifying and bringing up they receive you but to doubtful disputations amen oh hey brother well he doesn't believe the way we do so you know I'm just it's going through the motions you know just look me in the eye be a be a man if if you don't consider me a brother don't call me one amen I'll call your brother because I believe then and Believe by God that you are if God brings a separation and there's a difference there then that's up to him but to me you're my brother amen but if you don't think I don't tell me so amen I uh trust me my back is full of enough scars that one more is not going to make that big a difference I mean I've had enough knives stabbed in my back that all the scars that are there now one more is not going to make that big a difference amen just tell me the truth but that's just the thing doubtful disputations you understand now receive but don't receive to dealt with disputation for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs let not him that eateth despise him that Edith not and let him not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received him who art thou that judges another man's servant to his own Master Amen to God he standeth or Fallen yea he shall be holding up for God is able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind which is what we began this whole thing with amen when you do what you know is right in the eyes of God you have faith in it you stand on it don't do it and say oh you know I I shouldn't do this that's that every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and He that regardeth not the day to the Lord he doth not regard it he said eateth eat it to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he eateth not uh to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God things for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth in himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore die we are the Lord amen that's the bottom line amen no doubt for disputations whether we live whether we die we are the Lords whether you see it this way and I see it that way we are the Lords you are my brother because we are the Lords amen that that that is the discussion it should anyway but you notice that this that evil spirit gets in there that demonic spirit that just tries to twist it over amen we just got to be on we've got to be on our guards continuously Lord is this going to edify is this going to bless is this going to be profitable Lord amen and I believe we're all mature enough in the Lord in the scripture that we would know that really even out having to ask the question for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living but why Dost thou judge thy brother or why Dost thou set not thy brother for we shall stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and again people do it because they don't truly believe you're their brother or sister whatever it is they don't actually in their heart believe that you're their brother or sister that that's where that's where the Mind Falls you look at this saying why do you do your brother this way why do you believe your brothers why do you have anger against your brothers because they don't believe you are brothers why do you take your brother to court because they don't believe you're a brother that becomes the bottom line of us or a sister for it is written as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so then every one of us shall give account to himself of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block here we go now we're getting to another portion of edification that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him to him it is unclean and if it becomes a stumbling block for us to do that that they consider unclean in front of them or on purpose it's unclean look think about it this way and unfortunately it becomes a very arrogant spirit to think well this this brother this sister doesn't believe this but I'm gonna do it anyhow because bless the Lord I don't think there's anything wrong with it so I'm going to do it right in front of him and teach them a lesson that's not what the scripture says right amen if that person believes that any estate is going to send you to hell you should not eat a steak in front of that person right that's what the scripture says I'm going to do it never regardless I don't care what they think or believe see now you're now you're getting to those places that are very unedifying you're not going to help that person that way you're not going to be again what did we say last week Paul said we forget Paul said I I try he says I become all things to all men that I might win some amen what do I try to do become and move into that see that's just arrogance that wants to that wants to have a fight amen I I had this discussion one time with a with another younger brother it just getting out in the ministry and all and and I was and they were just against me unless they killed it they were just against me no meat unless it was an animal he killed out in the forest no means and I'm like well that's funny because the scripture says not to abstain from means that's what it says I think it's in Timothy not to abstain from means he said oh that's that that was back then he said it's okay if you kill it or something and see and so I got I I saw the rub there and the contention and I ended the conversation and I said because we weren't eating anything it wasn't the meal we were eating I said brother if that's the way you believe it and I pray that God bless you and I I'm probably paraphrasing I didn't say it exactly like this maybe but I said God bless you and what you believe and what you see there but I would hope and trust you don't condemn me for what I see of what I believe right I didn't get an amen from him but that's just the way it is amen it reminds me of getting on the airplane now you get on an airplane now uh Julie can probably tell you this because she's just on one but when you get on an airplane now every single flight I've taken in the past eight months every time every Airline they come on and say we no longer require the wearing of masks on our flights but if you choose to wear one please don't condemn or if you choose not to wear one please don't condemn those that choose to or not to in so many words what are they trying to get people to do just understand if this person wears a mask let her wear a mask I'm not hurting anything these people if they feel like they're okay not wearing a mask and don't condemn them for not wearing a mask it's their belief it's what they feel they're okay doing that and just get along that's kind of what they're trying to do to keep from people fighting on the airplanes but just get along you know and and you try to Defuse The Situation say brother I I respect what you believe and if you won't believe that way and you live that way then God bless you in that amen but again don't condemn me if I want to go have a rib eye next week don't don't tell me I'm going to hell or that my health has gone down the drain or whatever and and if it is then that's my choice but don't condemn me for it but I I wouldn't do something to throw right in that brother's face you understand I would I wouldn't do something to deliberately provoke that person because that's not edifying that's not profitable it's not going to help him and it's definitely not going to help me it's certainly not going to help my relationship with him and if we are both brothers together it's definitely not going to help the kingdom of God anymore right so what is it just becomes arrogance at that point my way is right your way is wrong that's the way I see it if you don't listen to me then you just you don't believe it and just go on and be what you are whatever it is amen because my Way's the right way that's okay and it might be but the Arrogant attitude and spirit so many times it turns people off it makes people not want to follow what you believe just because of your attitude about it amen amen anyway let's move on amen so then every 12th verse so then every one of us shall give an account to himself of God let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block on occasion to fall in his brother's way don't put that stumbling block amen amen I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean amen and even though I might have a completely contrary point of view I respect him for his point of view amen But If thy Brothers Lord help me things just keep coming to my mind it's like remember the story when brother when brother Brandon was with these heathens and they got to this certain place certain time and I forget a lot of the details but they got off and they started they knelt down beside a tree or something and they started praying to their God and brother Brandon got off and he started praying with them they think brother Adam what are you doing he said I'm respecting their belief I'm respecting dear God how about ever get them to listen to me if I don't respect what they believe amen if I don't respect what they believe they're not going to respect what I believe now what they believe may be wrong and it may send them to hell but me pounding them into the ground like a railroad Spike's not going to help anything amen and brother Randolph and prayed with them now he wasn't praying to the son God or whatever God they were praying to he's praying to his God but he was showing respect and dignity of the humanity of of a person with a soul amen that's that that's the best way to try to win somebody see But If thy brother be greed with thy me now walk us thou not charitably destroy not him with thy need for whom Christ died Amen Let not then your good be evil spoken of you might be doing exactly the right thing it might be 100 scripture it might be God's edifying and blessing to you but when it becomes unedifying to somebody else then it becomes a disaster it becomes unedifying because of that uh to someone else amen deliberate don't let your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace joy in the Holy Ghost for he that is of these things serveth Christ uh things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another follow those things which may edify another let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another Wise It's just self-indulgent self-serving arrogance even if you are right amen you can be very arrogant in your Pious attitude right right in it and hurtful for me destroying not the work of God all things indeed are pure but it is evil for the man who eat it with offense it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weep has thou faith we got to that just a minute have it did I sell before God happy is he that condemneth not himself the thing which ye alloweth he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he is not by faith of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin amen 50 first verse 1. we uh we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not not to please ourselves and then what would we say earlier how did Christ live his life Christ didn't live his life to be pleasing to himself he lived it to be pleasing to others let every one of us please his neighbor for his good edification good to edification for even Christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me fell on him for what for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope that hope comes through Christ Jesus that hope of faith in what he did for us not for himself but for us became becomes a blessing then it becomes edifying then it is building it is increasing it isn't helping us doesn't it it goes back to that it's more blessed to give than receive amen and I think we as Christians we can all say that I know the world may not say that but it's true amen I I get more out of something that I give somebody than somebody's give to me it might have been a blessing to me it might have been a help to me what they gave me but the joy and the the the the law the happiness that I get far exceeds giving somebody something than receiving it Amen to help that person to increase that person so that person would be built up amen be increased look we are all contractors we are all contractors we are all Builders every one of us on a job we call them the GM General Manager we're all general managers we're all Builders we're all general manager contractors because we're in the business of being edified a building not just ourselves building but helping others that all again if we're helping others being built we all get built then you don't really even have to worry about yourself amen the lord caught obviously lead us and bring us to places that's blessings and helpful to us but the whole point is to be there for other people yes just to be a blessing and to help to other people so that they get built up we're all Builders amen we are to we are to build amen Ephesians chapter four I got two more scriptures I'm on clothes Ephesians 4 11. this getting to the ministry now he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints again that perfecting is still mature growing up perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry whichever Ministry it is whether it's an apostle or a pastor or evangelist or a teacher whatever it is for that work for the edifying of the body of Christ now that's what a Ministry a true God called Ministry is supposed to do is supposed to edify the people it's supposed to help increase the people to build them up it never should be a a time where we come in and we're just lead the way we came in it's just nothing happened nothing's going on nothing said nothing done there should always be an edification in the word of God is being being preached if the pure unadulterated word of God is being ministered and brought to a place of edification not condescendingly I've heard it so many times that people lay the hammer down in the congregation and they come down so condescendingly it's like I'm I have ascended the the the Great Heights of the of the master gods and I'm looking down upon you people and I'm trying to tell you how to do it right that doesn't work it's not the way it's supposed to be and it's not true no man no Minister has got to that place but it's the it's the way it comes across and the way it's acted I want to understand see friends we're all together in this yes the only thing that differentiates is just the gift of God to bring a Ministry and the whole point is to edify is it to edify just you no it's both edifies me too in fact I get a double portion because it edified me in my office yesterday and now today because the Lord then unfolds and reveals in you and it becomes like okay Lord I made sure yeah what I do and Lord help me to be edifying I want I want it to make me better I don't I don't I might but I try not hope I never do anything that's going to make me worse yes I'm gonna try to do everything that I do that would make me better before the Lord to make me better before you to listen to God more to let him speak so that what he speaks can edify you and we all are edified and blessed because of it because that's what the ministry is to do is to edify it's not to condescend is to build up is to that's a part of the work of the ministry of God amen is to edify not to build himself up not to make himself a kingdom of some kind not to show off some kind of gift or some kind of thing you know how even though the things that happen at brother Brandon's Ministry if you ever look and hear about the spirit of that Ministry brother Branham is always he never builds himself up to the place of this great miracle healer he always tries to downplay that to the point to understand I'm just standing here as a man just like you with a knot with a gift that God has give not of my own to try to help other people that's the only reason yes in fact he said he told Billy Paul and and I believe it I can't remember if he said it on tape he said the gift's not for me is for you yeah and to understand that and to bring it to that point instead of trying to and and of a man that could have built a kingdom to himself a man that could have been a multi-millionaire and had anything he wanted to he could have had the biggest house he could have had the fanciest car he could have had the biggest bank account but that wasn't what he was here for right right it was for you me yeah it was for the people yes amen not for himself nor did he build himself up to that place for that to happen that way amen he turned down he turned down men that wanted to give him millions of dollars yes he did amen because it wasn't about him it wasn't about him building a kingdom or him using some gift to elevate himself to a position he uh didn't want or belong even amen just one of the people yes when I was looking at getting another car I told my wife I was went over to Cadillac place and I said I just it was one that I liked there and I thought I just now I've got a nice car but I said I just I and it's and I wouldn't have been anything wrong with it and you have a Cadillac that's fine I don't think anybody here does but if you're watching if anybody that's okay but I looked I thought I just you know because I heard brother Brown say one time he said how could I pull up in an old in the in the gravel driveway of an old shanty to pray for people that don't know where their next meal is coming from in a 50 000 Cadillac you know he could have and it would have been okay to do it but it wasn't about him right it was about the people amen and what was it going to be to edify not to be a stumbling block but to but to edify amen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning crackiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive but speaking in but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that by that which every joint supplier that is every one of us every one of us add to this body that brings the joints together so compact together amen that she's one body the mystical body of Jesus Christ according to the effectual that's passionate working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love the edifying of itself now then the body as a whole then is edified praise the Lord built up increase health I got one more Ephesians 2 19. now therefore just a couple chapters over Ephesians 2 19. now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with this uh with the Saints in the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building all of us Finley joined together frame together groweth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are building together for a habitation building together that word building is the same as edified build it together for an habitation of God through the spirit amen fitly joined together as one body the family of God the mystical body of Jesus Christ we're all a part of it internationally around the world yes people I may not know people I may never know in fact a lot of them are probably never will meet some I know some I've met amen I just believe I'm a part of it amen I believe you're a part of that family of God that's fitly joined together yes amen every joint supplies everyone is needful to bring this together is the ministry is to help to edify the body to bring the body to a place of growth and maturity in the Lord now part of that is being able to make sure that in every day of Our Lives we're living as unto the Lord every day we live as unto the Lord Jesus and everything that we do everywhere that we go everybody may not be watching you all the time but there is one that is watching and that is God yes he's the All-Seeing Eye amen let's stand if we could praise the Lord amen I want to sing this song again this course once again amen I know uh we're saying it with all of our hearts I trust you did I believe we did amen I want us to do it again maybe with a little different tone in our hearts spirits to the Lord As we sing it this way this time [Music] I didn't say what I was going to sing and he started playing it I didn't say what I was going to say again I didn't think I did he just started playing it I heard it amen we're gonna sing it God's in charge so please let me be pleasing here let everything I do believe [Music] [Music] sing along unto you oh Hallelujah let's sing it to him now yes please [Music] let everything God Preserve be crazy [Music] oh again one more time with all our hearts yes please [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let everything I pursue begins [Music] baby amen granted Lord Jesus and you know if he prepares us to be that sanctuary and everything that we do every choice we make every place we go thing we say is pleasing to the Lord Jesus edifying amen it's building up increasing making us better closer to the Lord Jesus I know it is amen we're faced with decisions sometimes tough decisions came in most days Let It Be edifying to the Lord Jesus so that we can be edifying and helpful to other people that maybe that they may be blessed as well to praise the Lord amen God bless you pray something was said the blessings shrink you today the Lord Jesus amen amen as I saw often do I always forget during the prayer request but I know that you pray for me in the trip this afternoon going to Colorado Springs this afternoon appreciate your prayers we're getting back to uh getting back to a normal week this week so it's going to be a it gets physically taxing so fortunately this is not an hour and a half hour and 45 minute flight something like that and so Denver and then a drive down to Colorado Springs so that part of it's a lot better but I appreciate your prayers for safe travel amen and just pray the Lord bless your good sleep and this upcoming week and if we don't Yep this week doesn't complete itself then I'll see you on the other side yes amen are done complete itself for us anyway [Music] I was thinking about if it would work out for everyone and it may depend a little bit on Craig and if uh things work out to get a place behind us here I'd like to have another meal together whatever that entails whatever that may look like whether it's at a house or behind us or a restaurant or something uh I like to do it like on Mother's Day next month which is in May but if it's at a restaurant that's probably going to be pretty close to impossible to get a restaurant that's going to house as many as we need on Mother's day but maybe we could if it's something that we do here or something like that so I'm just telling you that probably a month in advance advance just so you know what's on my heart and uh what I've been thinking lately so appreciate your prayers about that and just see what the Lord will do with it and where we go from here so pray the Lord bless you amen God is good isn't he yeah God bless you love you appreciate you amen we'll be dismissed in the word of prayer again I trust and pray something we'll sad to bless you today let's be aware everything that we do amen praise the Lord whatever we do we do as unto the Lord Jesus amen I told up I told the manager of our group the other day he was telling me uh kind of admonishing me and you know catching on and good worker and all that kind of stuff and I said well I don't mean this of an offense I said but I don't I don't work how I work for you or for Tom I do it for the Lord amen what I do I do unto the Lord now if you benefit from it wonderful if the team benefits from it great if I benefited from great but I do it is unto the Lord yes amen and again be all the glory he understood that amen he didn't really comment on it but he understood it he didn't care it was almost as long as I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing in all these That's the concern but we do what we do is unto the Lord praise the Lord so God richly bless you today appreciate each one of you being here today amen will be dismissed in order prayer and I'm gonna ask Joel if you well with you just miss us in prayer buddy Jesus thank you for this day this
