that reaches beyond this mortal reach a life that brings a life that most people crave for and very few know how to get right but i'm so thankful god has given it unto me amen praise the lord i forget some of those beautiful songs we used to sing at the tabernacle they're not in the book and appreciate brother zach bringing one of those back up i really enjoyed that song has a lot of meaning to it amen and it's a very fluid song it's easy to sing and uh just has a beautiful meaning to it so amen i know my heart was broken i know my life was in pieces when jesus found me amen praise the lord and i'm so thankful he did without him where would any of us be today saints amen praise the lord god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord appreciate each one of you coming being here today those who may be on the stream maybe watch it archived god bless you today um i had intended uh got together a little message and thought the lord put on my heart for today sort of with the thought that my recovery from my pulled tooth i had tuesday most of you know has been a little slower than i had expected i guess last time i had a tooth pull was about 10 years ago and age does make a difference i guess but this has been a little more uh struggling uh been a little longer to heal still having pain with it and i've worked since tuesday really keep my heart rate down uh so that it you know didn't start uh my heart pumping and the blood flowing and it would start throbbing uh i met sonia with a case of water down the stairs i brought the case of water the stairs and it just started pounding um a couple days ago so but uh you know i i came in here and that was my intention even sonya said take it easy this morning i said well you know it's up to the lord that's not up to me but my intention is to do that uh but as soon as the first song started to be sung and i felt the spirit come the pain left and i feel great so we'll just see what the lord's got in store today but appreciate the lord being present with us but uh god's been good amen and i'm so thankful that appreciate your prayers uh you know when you come out of that anointing things do change uh when you're under that anointing so but i just believe that it's it's going fine it's just slower than i i anticipated uh before i had teeth pulled uh closed up pretty quick within a couple days no pain after a couple days and things like that but uh this has been going on a week and so uh just a little slower than i thought but um but i appreciate the lord's healing that he put in our bodies it's amazing that people don't believe in god and just think that this is some kind of an intelligent design or whatever they call it and i'm thinking friends this is this is beyond intelligent design this body and our brains and our function everything about it is transcends an intelligent design uh intelligent designs is what people try to come up with today with uh uh ai artificial intelligence they can't even come close to what god did when he created us but amen but so i'm thankful that uh the healing of the lord has touched it so i appreciate your prayers amen today so let's stand to our feet if we could and i'm going to turn over to the scripture to ii timothy please pardon me if i reach in for my for my water a little more frequently meds kind of give me dry mouth and so um working against that too but i believe and thank god for healing amen amen i appreciate brother roger came yesterday i didn't even know he was going to do it he put all the tiles in well not all of them but all the full ones put all the tiles in and set the air and also events i appreciate brother roger doing that he did it by himself yesterday he didn't even tell me he was going to do it not that i've really been able to do it anyway but i appreciate brother roger doing that getting the tiles and putting them in it just makes it look a lot better really and look a lot better we get those pieces done so but uh appreciate brother roger for doing that thank the lord for touching um presidents and the first lady and uh apparently he's announced today he's covered free now so uh and had very little few symptoms uh so i appreciate that god's just been good to us lord knows whatever his will is is going to be done so we'll just trust you for that amen second timothy we're going to go to the first chapter begin with the sixth verse but before we read that we just bow our heads again for another word of prayer lord jesus truly you have given life to us today life eternal it's a life lord that transcends anything that we could think of or believe in or hope for and god is it's way beyond even as paul said what i can see ear could hear what we could even imagine with our minds lord what you have for us we thank you god for this time of fellowship we thank you for being here thank you for your word and for the revelation of that word to our hearts thank you for those that have come today father and we appreciate those who may be watching on the hookup and lord just pray god that your holy spirit would move now in a in a special way in a supernatural way god in a powerful way that lord this world will not become not coming word form only but in power and manifestation of your spirit may you grant it to us today god touch every heart and life meet every need heal every sick body lord deliver every uh uh heartbroken soul lord today we thank you god for giving us your grace and for helping us lord to come to this place one more time we're not promised lord another day we're not promised another service we're not promised another time like today but lord we thank you god for giving us this time and lord may we make the most out of what you've given us father because there will be a time where it would be our very last time and lord we thank you god for showing us your word and dream of blessing us with the revelation of the message of the hour in this present day truth and pray god that again you would anoint the speaker and the hearer that what you have to be accomplished today will be accomplished according to the purpose that you have counted it for in your mind before the foundation of the world we commit it to you now and ask your blessings upon the remaining part of it as we committed to you for your glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen first second timothy chapter one i'm going to begin reading with verse six now wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not there therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor me his prisoner be there but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god you can be seated if you'd like amen uh charismatic realms even sometimes i've had people in the message come and try to make me believe or feel like that the sixth verse was pertaining to uh the impartation of gifts is the laying on of hands and i beg to differ with anyone that takes that stance because if you look at this and you read the scripture the way that it is written it does not say that he is imparting a gift to timothy he's saying he's stirring up the gift that timothy already has by the laying on of hands so the laying on of hands is not an impartation of gift like a lot of the charismatics and and all would believe uh pentecostals and such it's just a stirring of a gift it's an acknowledgement of a gift that uh that timothy had that that paul was acknowledging into him of course you read the prior scriptures you see he talked about his grandmother eunice and his uh lois and his mother eunice uh being stirred with that gift that gift of faith the gift that was in timothy was a different gift but then paul helps timothy understand something and i believe that the lord was one to get across to us today and that's in the seventh verse because he tells timothy again wherefore i put the remembrance stir up that gift stir up that gift of god which is in you so the gift is already there the laying on of the hands was the acknowledgement of that gift the recognition of that gift the stirring of that gift and then he goes on to help timothy understand timothy god has not given us the spirit of fear right right amen so what he's telling timothy is that you are to be courageous timothy you are to take the gift that god has given you and be courageous with it don't be fearful of it don't be fearful of people don't be fearful of what might happen to you don't be fearful of what government might do or say to you but be courageous and go forward and and exercise the gift that's put in your life i'm putting hands on you to stir that gift up now let that gift flow through you let that gift manifest through you so that others could be blessed by it because god did not now that was the context by the scripture but what i want to talk about is to us today i wanted us to focus on that seventh verse and see that god has not given us the spirit of fear amen amen god has not given us the spirit of fear he has given us the spirit of power he has given us the spirit of love amen and he has given us the spirit of a sound mind that's right now we know that power without character is satanic right so if he gives us the power coming with that power has to be the spirit of love and of sound mind because the love and the sound mind is what constitutes somebody that has the character of jesus christ because god is love and the bible says of course you know paul said the philippian church so let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus so that of a sound mind which is a mind that produces the life of christ which is a replication of what jesus did what did jesus will look at the believer today because that's what they're supposed to be emulating because they have the same spirit in them that same sound mind so with the power comes the love and the sound bind but notice here what it says it says god paul is telling timothy now god has not given you the spirit of fear so this fear is a spirit right so the fear that's that that's gripping the world today that's gripping uh well the world you know i focus on our nation of course more than the world but uh but this this fear is gripping the world right uh we we were coming down the road today and and and again don't let this be offense to anybody that does don't mean it that way but we saw a woman walking down the sidewalk there was somebody within 50 yards of that woman she had a mask on outside according to science and edison the most safe place you can be is outside with a mask on with nobody around them and and my wife's asking me what do you think compels somebody to to want to have the mask on when they're in the middle of nowhere basically i mean there's nobody even close to that person the closest people to them are confined in their cars but yet wearing a mask and i i thought well that's just the conformity that the government wants to put upon people it's just that conformity it surprises me really it really what surprises me how easily especially americans are willing to relinquish their basic human rights to a government and a government really that's basically done nothing for them right i mean by and far has done nothing for them for the past probably 100 years right at least 50 years done nothing for them but yet relinquish their rights to that to that uh government that entity because according to the government they know better than the common person you know we're peasants that don't know much they know everything so we should follow and do everything they tell us but whatever that that person falls in line with that's up to that person so uh that's up to them but the fear is the thing that that uh you know i thought about too when it when it come to what the lord gave me yesterday because it's a spirit it's a spirit to recognize that it's a spirit because look friends fear doesn't attack your sight fear doesn't attack your uh your taste fear doesn't attack your touch fear doesn't attack what it does now those can be channels into your spirit those are channels into your subconscious but fear goes down into your subconscious fear goes down into your spirit that's where the this fear deals with is in your spirit because it is a spirit of fear right you you can only look at something and be afraid because of what your imagination is conjuring up people go in a dark room i mean you know why do they make light lights for children because there's there needs to be light when you get in a place of darkness there's a sense of fear people tend to have fear a spirit of fear will come in certain circumstances and instances and when that fear comes you see something but it's your imagination it's conjuring something up right see it it's like the uh it's like the monster in the closet or the monster under the bed when you're a kid see there's no monster on the bed but the kid is scared because it's imagination is a is imagining something that's not there and that's how satan does it satan works on a person's imagination satan works on a person's spirit to bring a spirit of fear on that person because he knows if he can bring fear into your life he'll separate you from faith right you will be separated from faith the moment you fear right because when you fear something you give into it and when you give into it you are its slave right there's no faith there it's like brother branham talked about with cancer when he talked about cancer as soon as the the word a lot of people as soon as that word cancer is mentioned fear comes on a person and they're gone their countenance changes their whole attitude changes and and all of a sudden they're they just might as well give up right there because they're done right because they fear it so greatly he said but and i'm paraphrasing of course brother branham said but you give someone that's not afraid of it and i'll stand in the face of it by faith and believe then i'll find you somebody that can be healed because they still have faith to believe that god is still god that god will still heal them that god's still in the healing business you believe god still heals amen god said friends god never promised us that we would never get sick did he never promise you you'd never get sick he just said i will be your healer am i he said by my stripes you're healed that's right so when we do get sick we know that he's our healer god is there to to provide and to take care of us so why what is there to fear it's a spirit satan works in the demonics satan works in the principalities and powers of the air of things that we can't see in that spirit realm and that's where he sends that spirit of fear see that spirit of fear comes into that same realm because we don't fight against principalities and powers of of the world flesh and we don't fight against flesh and blood but principalities and powers of the air the dark wickedness and dark places things we don't see we fight against that that spirit those spirits friend to understand those spirits are very real yes they are you may not recognize it to the point that what they really are i don't know that any of us do to that exact point but spirits are real right you don't think spirits are real you go back and and read about saul and jonathan going to the witch of endor the witch of endor the demonic evil spirit of the witch of endor and he implores her to call up the spirit of samuel who had gone on to come up to and consult with samuel saul wanted to talk to samuel so bad he went to a witch to bring his spirit up so that he could converse with him you don't think those spiritual real friends there are real that's right they're absolutely real you think it ended with the witch of endor oh absolutely not that same spirit is here today oh yeah satan used hollywood many years ago to begin you to begin to glamorize wickery and glamorize demonic spirits and glamorize bewitching right i just said that word triggered you didn't it you remember the years ago the tv show bewitched oh it glamorized with being a witch made it look like oh this is this is a wonderful thing to be a witch all i have to do is twinkle my nose and i can move all the uh chairs and and and be from one place to the other and and move a mountain all i gotta do is twinkle my nose glamorizing it oh and there's a bunch of them that's come after that you know what i'm talking about right all the shows and movies and things that glamorize demonic spirits that glamorize bewitching and wickery but it's as real today as it has always been right back in saul's day that witch called up a dead person and saw and jonah could stand there and see him and talk to him samuel talked to them and said why have you disturbed my arrest seeing that you're you've been made the enemy of god why have you disturbed me you're the enemy of god right this time tomorrow you and your sons will be with me brother branham said he came up he was still samuel and he was still a prophet yes because he prophesied and told him this time tomorrow you'll be with me praise the lord a witch though think about that a witch working in that spirit working in that spirit realm and that spirit how real it is of fear that satan tries to put upon people that satan will try to put upon you in every form of life to bring fear upon your life but god has not given us the spirit of fear he's given us a spirit of power yes a spirit of love and a spirit of the sound mind praise the lord look at this let's go over to the second uh first kings first kings chapter 22. let's see this this battle against that those spirits now satan uses those spirits but god will orchestrate those spirits as well because those spirits know who they have to answer to they're the spirit of satan but they know that they have to answer to a different authority first kings chapter 22 uh verse 20 the story of micah ahab and jehoshaphat going up to uh take over the land raymond gilead and they're asking all their prophets you see he had has all his prophets there he's got them all lined up he's got them all in in unison they're all saying the same thing they're all saying one thing and it's just like today friend it seems like well if if if all the and every one of them was a liar every one of them such so that jehoshaphat had just a little sparkle of god left in him said don't you just have one more ahem 400 wasn't good enough for you 400 the best prophets school trained i've had the raised up and and taught to be prophets they're not good enough for you i said just don't you just have one more yeah i got one more but i hate him oh don't let the king say so yeah but he always speaks evil against me that's cause you're as big a liar as the 400 prophets you've trained to lie on your behalf you're liar as they are but just one more yeah his name's micah son of him they go go get him and bring him out here and so god shows micah what's going on and he comes out there and he knows that he's only going to say now they go and they try to tell now look you know we'll bring you back in the fellowship micah we'll we'll bring you back into the church and we'll even give you a position said just this one time please just this one time won't you speak what's good about the king and mike has said the some of the best words anybody could ever utter i'll say only what god gives me to say amen i'll only say what god puts on my lips what god tells me to say is what i'll say and god ahab had made himself an enemy to god so god and ahab were on top of speaking terms so when it come to a man who was willing to say what god said and not lie like the rest of them then god had somebody he could work with amen so micah begins to prophesy and he begins to tell what god shows him as as he comes up 20th verse now and the lord said who shall persuade ahab now look at this this is this is the vision this is the the uh the the what god has showed micah that took place because what it took place in god's mind was then manifested on the earth and what god is showing micah is what had happened in heaven and as as micah begins to explain it he says the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramos gilead because see the prophet's words elijah's words had to be fulfilled and he'd already said that the dogs would eat jezebel and that the dogs would lick his blood at the same place that uh they killed nabal see and so that had to happen because a prophet said it a prophet prophesied it so now there's got to be a way to manifest that there's got to be a way to make that happen to cause that to happen not make it happen cause it to happen so god see so god's calling says who can go up and and persuade ahab that he'll go to ramoff gilead because this battle needs to happen so he can so he can be shot he can be driven wounded down to the place that they killed naboth and the dogs will lick his blood there right because that was the prophecy all these events look at look at what god does saints god takes a little thing over here and and he and he makes causes this to happen over here and he brings all these circumstances together just so a prophecy that a prophet gave would be fulfilled just so that ahab would go to the place that he was supposed to go to be shot and then the dogs didn't lick his blood where he was shot did you know that the dogs didn't lick his blood where he was killed a lot of times you think the dogs will lick your blood well as soon as he shot the blood the dogs would be there that's not what happened he was shot he was killed and the chariot contained ahab's blood and the chariot was driven down where naboth was and when they washed the blood out of the chariots the dogs were there to lick up the blood just exactly like the prophet said not the way you may have imagined it was going to happen but exactly the way god spoke to a prophet for it to happen it didn't say ahab was going to be there just said the dogs would lick your blood and that's what they did but god now is causing that to happen who will persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramachelia and one said in this manner another set of that manner and there came forth a spirit a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him and the lord said unto this spirit now wherewith how are you going to do this and that spirit said to the lord i will go forth and i will put a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so so who is orchestrating this demonic spirit you say how you know it's demonic because it's a lying spirit amen it's a spirit of lies which is unbelievably prevalent today but the spirit of line that's a demon right people don't recognize how much that lie that those lies that's a demon when a person just blatantly comes out in lies that's a spirit that's working in your spirit to cause you through your consciousness to lie and that's a demonic spirit so this demonic spirit has now received permission from god to go to those prophets and put a lying spirit in all the mouths of those prophets and that's exactly what happened the lying spirit came and put a lie in all the mouths of those prophets a lying spirit understand that's where that that works through that spirit realm that lying that lying spirit it's a demonic spirit to cause that spirit to do what uh what overcomes that person to do that prevailing nature of that spirit and that prevailing nature of that spirit of fear is that spirit of the devil that comes into a person to cause him to lose faith in where their core belief is right and that's jesus christ and his word if he can cause you to fear he can cause you to disbelieve the word he can separate you from actual truth he can separate you from receiving the blessings of god just by fear coming in your life but paul said he hasn't given us the spirit of fear very much we don't have the spirit of fear friend amen fears of the devil right fears of the devil faith is of god amen faith is in existence where faith cannot exist but understand something satan's not gonna quit satan doesn't just give up because we stand here and proclaim the faith in our lives of jesus christ god and his word he's still going to continually to batter you with a spirit of fear a spirit of fear but god has given us the spirit of power amen amen you ever know the spirit of power so now in you is is not again this isn't we're not talking about something fleshly god hasn't given you big muscles god hasn't given you strength in your body now one can lead to the other but we're not talking about mr universe we're talking about strength and strength in your spirit god has given you power in your spirit and it's not just power of strength listen now this power comes to an ability an ability a person could be the strongest person physically in the world but not have the ability to do something somebody some guy may have so many muscles he does not have the ability to tie his shoelaces right because he can't bend over too much too many muscles he may not have the ability this power that he's talking about this scriptural spiritual power is an ability god is giving you the spirit to be able to what have faith amen have faith and belief it is an authority this power is an authority it gives you the ability and the authority to do it we talked about last week a little bit on the authority to be able to do something not just the power but be able to know that when you speak all of heaven is backing you up amen when you enforce something the holy spirit is there if you're born again to enforce that to to cause that to bring that to pass amen amen but it's the ability it's the authority to do it amen it's virtue it's miracles this power is an influence but it's also the one thing i want to get across now maybe more than anything it gives you the right you say power the right if you look through the scripture you'll see as i studied this i saw how this power gives you the right to do something it's like last week when we talked about us having the power to enforce something that satan has tried to take from us or satan has taken god has given you the authority god has entrusted you with the power the ability and the right to do it right you have the legal right to do it amen amen this spirit of power comes with the authority the ability uh its miracles its healings its influence but it's the right to do it in god's eyes you have the right to do it satan does not have the right to do it right if satan is on your ground he does not have the right now if you allow him to do it and we can go back to uh even like we talked about last week with property with tangible property you can own a house you can have a yard somebody comes in your yard you can have no trespassing somebody comes in your yard you can say you have to leave or i'll call the police you have the right to do that because he has no right to be there because it's not his property it's not public property it's your property you have a right to that not him so if that power is given it's given you the right to do it not only the ability not only the authority not only the virtue or the influence but it gives you the right to do it right amen so in the mind of god i have the right to do what i'm doing amen i have a right to stand upon god's word that says by my stripes you are healed amen i have a right to stand on that word it seems like medicine has taken control of that and i'm not preaching against medicine right uh medicine has its place and it's fine in his position brother branham went to a doctor often talked about it on tape many many times had a very good friend his doctor called dr adair so i'm not preaching against that but i do preach against it when it comes to trying to separate you from what god is trying to give you and that's faith yes that's faith in god's unfailing word that he promised you he would do it that's our right to claim it we have the ability we have the authority the right to do it let's go to a very familiar scripture mark 16. saint mark chapter 16. because as wonderful as this sounds to have this right to have this ability and authority there's also responsibility that comes with this power remember power without character is satanic right so the character of it has got to be present to be able to utilize the power in the proper way to be able to have the right to do it you also have to carry with it the spirit of love compassion and the spirit of a sound mind the mind of god we'll just just couple that with the mind of god the same the same as god let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus the sound mind love which is god so being able to have the characteristic to follow up with what the power has enabled you to do is as crucial as actually obtaining it and having it itself mark 16 verse 14 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart god help us god help me amen amen the miracles the the right the ability authority the right that god has given us today and so many times we we let it slip so many times we don't utilize it we let fear take over our lives we let fear rule us we let fear take over of how we live and what we do so god help me because he had braided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature power that's what paul power manifestation of the spirit you know what he said didn't come in word form but empower amen jesus is a word he's power he's spirit he's life amen he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow who them that believe so this is for the believer so if you're a believer follow along with me if you're not i pray you become one before you leave today amen or before you we quit this service and if you're watching all these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so look at this for just a moment brother rogers very popular i guess and we know as i've known for years for his mark 16 prayer line where he says lay hands on the sick and we lay hands have a prayer line come through and all we do is lay hands on because that's what the bible said the prayer of faith saved shall save the sick as well but this says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so what is this a little snippet you got red letter bible i do too this is jesus speaking he said these signs follow the believer these signs so these are the things that that my followers the believer is going to manifest this is what is going the fruits they're going to bear in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink inly deadly any deadly thing it shall not hurt them but now what does he say he said we're cast out devils and if they lay hands on the sick so that's not so you understand it's saying they're not it's it's not propagating there will never be sickness it's just saying when they get sick we'll lay hands on them and they'll be well that's what his promise is not that they wouldn't get sick but that will lay hands on the sick hard hard to lay hands on sick when they're not here but we'll lay hands on them virtually can we do that they want to do everything virtually today so we virtually lay hands on everybody yeah not the same thing friends sorry it is not the same thing but it says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now this sounds like quite a powerful section of scripture amen will take up serpents not hurt you well paul manifested that later in the scripture i told you that in my in in my feeling in my conversation with the lord and what's in my spirit is when we're in the work of the lord here there's nothing to fear right paul was in the work of the lord and the snake come and grabbed him by the hand he was in the work of the lord he was he was preaching to heathens right and it was a very venomous snake he shook it off in the fire and he just kept on preaching and they stood back because they thought it was the devil but then when he but then they said oh wait he's about to die now that's one that's the most venomous snake he'll just he'll be dead in a few minutes and he stands there and preaches and preaches and preaching and they looked at him and all of a sudden they become amazed and now they think he's a god so who do you think this is my assessment of it who do you think caused that poisonous snake to come and bite paul who caused that to happen now satan may have been instructing the poisonous snake i don't know does it say but i guarantee you god orchestrated that whole thing because at first those heathens weren't listening to paul but as soon as he shook that snake off and he didn't die they thought he was a god and as soon as they thought he was a god they began to hear what he had to preach and when they listened to what he had to preach it changed their lives amen this is a reason for everything friend there's no reason to fear if you were standing there or or or doing the work of the lord and something come and struck you or a snake or something like that fear a lot of times the first thing comes to a person's mind they get afraid oh it's a rattlesnake oh don't fear amen don't fear there could be a very good reason and if you're a believer i believe there is a very good purpose for why god is allowing this to happen right paul just shook it off and kept going all of a sudden they thought the man was a god and they started to listen to what he had to say amen see god's in control of this friend yes but that power look what that power does that power with authority ability you have a right to that power but that power comes with responsibility because mark 16 talks about this and it says the signs shall fall them to believe they shall cast out devils who is that going to help those that are demon-possessed right amen you stand here and cast out a devil it's not helping you in fact there's times that we've had service and there's been devils present and prayed for people and cast devils out that those devils followed me home right and i see them sometimes at night because they follow you home it's not benefiting us when you speak to those demons and you cast those devils out but it's benefiting the person that's being freed from that devil right that power gives responsibility brother brother dennis prayed it at the opening prayer of this service we're living our life for others we're staring heaven in the face that's what this power this spirit of power is given to us for so that we can go forth helping other people casting out devils speaking with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is to the benefit of other people it's not something that i abhor to say oh this is i am this great person like a lot of times you see people especially well dares i say unbelievers that have a gift they they proclaim there's something they proclaim there's somebody they'll tell you and try to convince you that they got this great gift and they're this great mighty prophet or they're this great mighty uh they could speak or gifts of healing or whatever friend if you've got a gift like that all it's going to do is if it's a gift of god and it's put in the right vessel all it's going to do is cause you to be more humble it's not going to cause you to be puffed up it's not going to cause you to to project yourself as some great healer or some great prophet or something right it's going to cause you to be humble it's going to bring you down to where you are a servant to other people because that's what this power is for that's what this authority this right that god has given you is to be able to go forth and to help other people amen and when you're helping other people you give them the gospel you help them get the gospel so that they can understand and receive what you've got am i healing is temporal friend you could be healed of one thing today and die tomorrow right but eternal life is eternal life amen how many people met their eternal destination this week without knowing jesus christ right sometimes when that hits my heart i wake up on a sunday morning and that hits my heart i think god help me how many people there was a uh and i'll just say it there there was a because it keeps coming to my mind there was a a a rock and roll legend that i used to listen to when i was a kid died this week right and all my thoughts could thank god did he know you yes right did he know him before he took that last breath because that's all that matters to him right now it don't matter how many times he was uh money he had or uh concerts he gave or how good a guitar he played or anything else all that mattered at that moment in time was did he know jesus christ right yes that's right and i think how many people died this week in this world without knowing jesus i dares to say it was a lot right a lot this power gives us responsibility this responsibility is to try to help other people i know we're gleaning i know we're in a gleaning age i know this country is burnt over uh i mean even i even had a question from her brother this week do you think the prophecy or the vision that brother branham had about border border coast to coast was metaphoric and i thought well no because brother graham talked about the volcanics exploding too and all so i believe it's literal but it's become so burned over that you feel like sometimes maybe that vision was metaphoric it's burned over border border coast to coast god help us if there's one seed though help us to find it lord amen just one whoever it is wherever if we can help somebody even make it there with without being in the city or something if i could do something to help somebody if i can just do something to help this miserable life on this earth be a little bit better for them right if this is all they're gonna have that's right help me to do it if this is all they're going to have and i can help make what they're doing here better help me to do it because it comes with responsibility this power is granted to the believer in order to help others yes but it comes with authority it comes with uh uh ability and the right you have the right to do it it doesn't say it says the believer has a right to cast out devils it has the believer has a right to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it does not say that the person that's receiving healing is a believer it says the person that's laying hands on them has a right to lay hands on them and cast that devil out right now it could be a believer and a lot of times that's probably true because a lot of times this is manifested in churches but you can find somebody out here in the world i came i came to the tent meeting that brother roger monday night i hadn't felt up to coming the rest of the time but monday night i came before i had the dentist tuesday and he was talking about the pool of bethesda and jesus coming and stepping over and around the pool and stepping all around all the people that were sitting there and been sitting there saying maybe even longer than the man had been there for 38 years maybe some been there longer maybe some in worse condition than this guy but he goes to one man he goes to one person to find now do we know what that person did afterwards now jesus when the woman come with the uh with the calling the act of adultery jesus said go sin no more and i don't believe she did but we don't know because it doesn't say i don't believe she did i believe when god does something i think he does it permanent but you notice the bible doesn't say it says that the believer lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's all it says it says that uh that we should uh take up serpents drink deadly things you know brother green often use that drink deadly things for people who considered or not considered taking chemo even right now i would go with him there uh that probably a good example to understand you know if it's something that medical sciences deemed that's going to be a help to you uh then take it because it won't harm you because the bible says you can drink that deadly thing and it won't hurt you right if you're a believer amen i believe that so i stand upon that i trust god for that right amen let's go to acts chapter one and all the glamorization of all this power that you see utilized by demonic spirits and you see hollywood glamorize that and make it look like oh this is this is such a wonderful thing you know if you were just a witch you could twickle your nose and you could be able to move mountains if you're a son or daughter of god you just have faith you move the mountain but you don't move but but see the big difference here is the power without character and the power went character the power in the demonic realm is for their own self-interest right it's for their own purpose the power with character is to help other people is to try to get other people to jesus christ is to try to do what the will of the lord is to be done not my will satanic powers satanic wishes my power my wishes my way jesus says his way is our our way is his way i'm a prisoner to him i'm here to do his will this power's instilled in me this right god's given me is for his purpose for his will whatever he wants to be done it comes now acts chapter 1 verse 6. when they therefore will come together they asked of him saying lord will doubt this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you amen and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the other most parts of the earth now the other most parts of the earth is us today i believe it wasn't them for that time because they couldn't go to the other parts of europe right in that day they didn't even know there was an utter most parts of the earth right i mean if they're standing there listening to jesus they utter most parts of the earth maybe they're thinking their name the end of their neighborhood or them uh or or where the earth dropped off because it was flat or whatever they were thinking they didn't know what the other most parts of the earth were because they'd never been there right that nobody been in this part of the country this world part of the world before they didn't know this even existed so that other part of most parts of the world is us today we have the ability friend there's not a speck of grain of sand or dirt on this planet on this rock hanging out in space that we can't go to right and it's something i wouldn't want to go to but there's there's none i couldn't go to you can fly there you can drive there you can ride a horse there or or something you can get there walk to almost every single spot on the planet why shall i say every single spot on the planet you could you could go there people climbed to the highest part of the earth on mount everest uh i don't i don't know how deep the ocean is because i don't know if anybody ever knows for sure exactly the deepest part of the ocean but they've been awful deep down there too they've been east and west north and south the other most parts but he said you shall receive power when after the holy ghost has come upon you right now this power notice the power that comes is when the holy ghost comes upon you now that now that that power comes with the anointing because remember when he said here let me read it back here you don't have to turn there but in timothy again the way paul said it god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power god has given us the spirit of power given is furnished or endued with or shall i say in this case with the holy ghost anointed he is given or anointed with the holy ghost with the holy ghost comes that power when he talks about the holy spirit and the spirits those spirits come with an anointing because it's something that comes on you in an immersion which is a baptism an anointing is the baptized when you're anointing somebody you're immersing them you're feeling you're causing them to be fully engulfed in whatever it is just like uh pouring the anointing oil aaron did down uh down to run down uh uh aaron's beard down to the hem of his garment that anointing oil it anointed him from the top of his head the soles of his feet it covered him and engulfed him well that given is endued it's given it's it's anointed and in the place of the holy spirit or a spirit it's an anointing that comes this spirit becomes an anoints it's not uh this is not that indwelling it because that indwelling comes the anointing comes to bring power the indwelling comes to bring character you understand when the holy spirit comes on people they have the power to operate gifts to live a certain way or be a certain way sometimes it's only in church sometimes people have enough god to get them until uh they get to work and the first dirty jokes told and you know there they go right no or they have just enough anointing to take them to church for six or eight months and then all of a sudden a little thing comes and they're gone six or eight years and you know a little trial comes and then they're gone that's just an anointing but the the character comes when the when the person of jesus christ through the anointing of the holy ghost comes and lives and takes permanent residence of your soul that changes your character now the power with character is jesus christ the power without the character is satanic which means people have that power but don't have the character right but jesus said that that power will come on you when you receive the holy ghost when the holy spirit comes upon you then the power comes with it so if you've been anointed if you've been filled if you've been born again by the holy spirit you have this power right it's innate in you it becomes a part of you this power does this power is granted so that we can have something that leads us into doing the will of the lord but it comes by the holy spirit now let's go over to another scripture first corinthians mama time's gotten away first corinthians chapter 2 verse 2. i haven't got to love or sound mine yet but we'll make those a little short first corinthians chapter two verse two for i have determined not to know anything among you say jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power amen and of the manifestation of the spirit of christ upon your life the word king not just words not just something that's spoken just not something that's orally given but it come in power an anointing of the holy spirit jesus christ and that holy ghost coming and anointing and changing you changing lives making that power come not just into one human not just to one man but into a men a many member body amen that power that power with authority has come upon you when i come and preach to you not just words they weren't just to be words but in power of god that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man here we go amen your faith listen to me today friend listen to me you're on this you're on the street listen to me your faith is not to be in the wisdom of man amen right your faith is to be in god amen your power is not given to you by the wisdom of man it's given to you by god it's given to you by the authority of almighty god in the spirit and the anointing that comes with the character of jesus christ our faith is not to be in the wisdom of man but in the power of god friend god is able to keep us god is able to watch over us god is able to heal us god is able to strengthen us god is able to protect us god is able to hedge us god is able he's got if we could just if this spiritual mind can open today to see the angels of god and camped around about everyone that fears him would say what is their fear she don't mean so much we look at the tangible today or we've got to see it or we've got to feel it or i've gotta i've gotta be able to touch it or something or that's not faith anything that the senses declare is not faith right right anything that see tastes phil smeller here declares is not faith we don't rely on the wisdom of man right we rely on the faith of god god is what changes it and makes it real for us amen amen spirit of power he's given us the spirit of love that love is agape god's love he's given us the spirit of god's love that spirit of love is it's a spirit just like we're talking about the spirit realm that's that's why that warfare is going in the spirit realm amen that spirit realm demonic spirits the spirits of god still at war continually at war but god's given you the spirit of love amen the spirit of god's love now god's love i've told you many times to me and what god's revealed to me god's love is unconditional god's love perfect love comes without conditions you just love you don't love because you just love love exists because god exists and as long as god exists there'll be love right because he is love amen and if god is in you you are love amen because god's love exists in you right and it don't just exist it manifests itself god manifests that love through you not to those just have been good to you or spoke good things about you or done things for you giving you money or food or something no it's to those who haven't those who maybe have spoke bad against you somebody who maybe had drug you through the mud yondering back maybe they've criticized you maybe they've put you down maybe they physically assaulted you but the god in you loves that person unconditionally the love of man says one hand washes the other no no the love of god says i'll wash them period amen the love of god says you pat me on the back i'll pat you on the back the love of god says i'm gonna pat you on the back with you hit me in the face amen amen you don't hear very many turning the cheap messages anymore but it's still the bible right that's right isn't that what jesus said if they strike you on one cheek give him the other right you don't hear him any of that but that's exactly what it says and you know the devil takes advantage of that too right you know the devil takes advantage of christians that way because they know a true christian is going to be like that amen and they take advantage of them but you know what happens in the spirit realm god more than makes up for anything the devil can do against you right god way makes up more 10 million times more than what disabled whatever the devil can take from you god will give you tenfold and plus amen so we don't worry about what satan can do to us amen we worry what god can do to us god has given us a love a love and you know well let's just read this first john chapter four first john now not saint john first john chapter four and we'll close here in just a minute first john chapter four verse 17. first john 4 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love praise the lord there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear amen because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us perfect love cast out fear now this love john talks a lot about love but when he comes to the fourth chapter he introduces a perfect love not just love but a perfect love which is unfaint which is unconditional again unconditional and it's a love that's manifested to others it's a love that's given it's a love that's shown it's a love that's produced and that love casts out the fear there is no fear when you have perfect love because everything about you is is god and if everything about you is god then god does is god afraid god's not afraid well if god's not afraid then what's satan doing messing with you because he knows he can still try to get to your mind your body your spirit and try to get you to disbelief to try to get you gripped in fear that's what satan's doing with this coping mess he's trying to grip the world with fear now i'm not saying there's not a reason for concern right i'm not saying that it's 200 000 people dead in the united states from a million worldwide i think or something like that i lose attractive figures but it's something to that effect but it but it's not to be something that you fear it's not to be feared friend if if perfect love is in your life that perfect love will cast out that fear amen you won't have fear if you know and trust believe god is going to be there to take care of you to watch over you we have a right to it right that's the power that god's given us this perfect love cast out the fear so where the perfect love of god is there is no fear amen amen you don't fear you don't have fear no matter what's running around the world today amen you don't fear god has given us and i'm going to leave that there god has given us the spirit of a sound mind a sound mind we've talked about the sound mindset i've got one more scripture i want to read a sound mind is being a a mind of moderation or self-control right a mind of god's mind a sane sane if you will sanity let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus now this does not say and this does not mean that a person that might be uh mentally disabled in some way is not seen you understand what i'm saying brother branham said you can be you could be totally insane as he put it and still have the holy ghost still have the holy ghost of a sound mind is the mount is the mind of jesus amen is to have the mind of christ is to mind the things of christ and that mind lead and guide you into the perfect ways of the lord because we're because if we have that mind we do the things that god tells us to do by his spirit one more scripture i'm gonna go ahead and close here it's getting late romans uh romans chapter eight let's begin reading with the 14th verse romans 8 14. listen this now as we close romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god not physically but spiritually for ye no for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you have not listen you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear which is exactly what the world's trying to do to you right that's exactly what satan's eden is offering you his bondage to bind you to bind you to what to him but god's not giving us that spirit of bondage to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry about father what does the spirit of adoption tell us that we belong to god we are a part of the family i am a son or daughter of god if i am his child then i'm responsible to him not all the other am i to god that's my responsibility because i am a part of the family of god and if i'm part of the family of god then god treats me as such the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen because we are born into that family by that one spirit and that one spirit then dictates to us and our lives are hidden in him yes satan and the world they try to glamorize the demonic powers the demonic spirits friend but don't don't fall into that i i know when i was a kid we used to watch that show the blonde lady was on it and she'd twinkle her nose and and people would appear people would disappear and things would move and all this stuff and oh wow how neat but that's of the devil that's satanic power yes that's not the power that we're looking for that's the power that's self-serving we're looking for the power that we want to help and serve others the power of god the power that takes us from this mortal reach into an immortality it takes us from from this uh flesh life into a spirit life into an eternal life a perfect eden with god amen amen beyond this life god has not given us god has not given us the spirit of fear but he's given us the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind amen amen god bless you let's stand if we could praise the lord lord help us amen it's so easy for the things of the world and the things that satan puts before us to take over us sometimes we get fearful for our families and we get fearful of our food or home or paying the bills or sickness or disease or affliction or uh most commonly covet 19 or whatever it is but god has given us a spirit of love power let's turn to 271. amen we'll sing the chorus the family of god let's sing this chorus here amen aren't you thankful saints it should be something we act upon too many times we act or react i shall say on what we see taste feel smell here instead of what god is witnessing to our hearts what god is
