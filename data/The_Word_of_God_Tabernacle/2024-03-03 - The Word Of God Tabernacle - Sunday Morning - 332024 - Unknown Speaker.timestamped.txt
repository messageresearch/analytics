[43:50] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[43:54] Matthew
[43:55] 11:25 and at that time Jesus answered
[43:58] and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[44:01] Heaven and Earth because because thou
[44:03] has hid these things from the wise and
[44:06] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[44:09] you could be seated if you'd like amen
[44:12] as I said uh this is God in Simplicity
[44:16] the 13th
[44:19] Part God in Simplicity part 13 is the
[44:22] subtitle of Bride versus church or bride
[44:24] and the church part four amen part four
[44:29] uh we've gone through the first first
[44:30] three parts have been quite poignant to
[44:33] me amen there been a been a blessing as
[44:35] a reminder uh to me uh and it's it meant
[44:39] a lot to me but part four now is we were
[44:42] looking at this yesterday I want to go
[44:43] to St John chapter
[44:45] 3 come to my heart something very U uh
[44:49] very striking when I was just a young
[44:51] boy uh when my parents were very I would
[44:55] say
[44:56] uh I would consider us devout Baptist um
[45:01] we uh we went to church that I can
[45:03] recall every Sunday for the for most of
[45:07] my the younger part of my life uh till
[45:10] my dad got to the place that he
[45:12] recognized it was something more uh
[45:14] wrote a letter to the Baptist Church and
[45:17] said take our name off of your role uh
[45:19] and so on so forth and uh and then we
[45:22] didn't go to church for a while and then
[45:24] the Lord showed him uh
[45:26] uh what we believe today and uh and then
[45:30] we and then my my parents were faithful
[45:32] to church every service not Sundays
[45:35] every Service uh for the most part
[45:37] within reason of course but uh but there
[45:40] was something that always stuck with me
[45:42] that when when we were in the Baptist
[45:44] Church and um when I went to Sunday
[45:46] school in the Baptist Church and the one
[45:49] thing that I remember the most uh being
[45:52] in the Baptist Church was John
[45:54] 3:16 uh the Baptist Church uh I don't
[45:57] mean this in a derogatory way I don't
[45:59] mean this to be uh slant on anybody or
[46:02] any church but they drilled this into
[46:05] you when you're a kid when you're a
[46:06] child they did us anyway uh maybe it's
[46:09] different where you go but in the South
[46:10] and the church uh uh and and again I
[46:14] don't mean that word to be a derogatory
[46:17] uh term because uh honestly we'd all we
[46:20] all should be familiar with the
[46:21] scripture but by the time I was probably
[46:24] five or six of my earliest Recollections
[46:26] I could quote uh John 3:16 from har uh
[46:31] and and mainly they get the credit for
[46:33] that so but let's go back and read John
[46:36] 3:16 let's let's start at the 15th verse
[46:39] though St John verse uh chapter 3 verse
[46:44] 15 uh and and and maybe just get a
[46:48] little deeper than than probably well
[46:51] absolutely what the Baptist Church took
[46:53] me uh and my family because we come to
[46:56] find out there's a little more depth to
[46:58] the word than just believing amen amen
[47:01] but now John 3:15 let's start reading
[47:04] there John
[47:06] 3:15 that whosoever believeth in him
[47:10] should not perish but have eternal life
[47:14] for God so loved the world that he gave
[47:17] his only begotten son that whosoever
[47:20] believeth in him should not perish but
[47:23] have everlasting life amen now now that
[47:27] belief we're going to get into a little
[47:28] bit deeper a little bit later but just
[47:31] to understand the scratching of the
[47:33] surface of of a common understanding of
[47:36] something as if you just believe in
[47:38] something a belief in something is
[47:40] something that that proves to you or you
[47:43] believe that it exists uh that's what
[47:47] belief is uh you believe something it
[47:50] means that you believe that it exists uh
[47:53] and when you read the scripture and of
[47:56] course and and I just have to say it the
[47:58] way it was when I was younger I may
[48:01] everybody maybe a little bit different
[48:02] depending on where you went to church
[48:04] where you grew up maybe the teaching was
[48:06] a little different but the the teaching
[48:09] that I received and from what I've seen
[48:11] a lot of people follow along the same
[48:13] guidelines that if you if you read this
[48:15] scripture just at face value and you
[48:18] just simply believe you're just simply
[48:20] believing that God is that's enough to
[48:23] Grant you eternal life but I'm sorry to
[48:26] inform people today but it takes a lot
[48:29] more than just believing that he exists
[48:32] the devil believes he exists in fact the
[48:35] devil knows he ex uh but we obviously
[48:39] know that the devil's not saved uh the
[48:42] devil's not going to be born again the
[48:43] devil's not going to come through the
[48:45] blood the brother the devil's never
[48:46] going to be your brother so uh but he
[48:49] believes amen so it takes us to the
[48:52] point to understand then exactly what is
[48:55] it that John is trying to get across
[48:57] it's not just something that's simply
[49:00] believing that something exists amen
[49:04] it's not just simply believing that
[49:06] something exists although a lot of
[49:07] people would try to maybe get you to
[49:10] believe that or try to get you to see it
[49:12] that way but it's it's more than just
[49:14] believing God exists amen let's continue
[49:17] to read I like I said I'll delve into
[49:20] that a little deeper a little bit
[49:22] later believ in the him should not
[49:25] perish but have everlasting life for God
[49:28] sent not now this this is some powerful
[49:30] teaching here really that uh uh wish we
[49:33] had gone into uh when I was younger but
[49:35] anyway for God sent not his son into the
[49:38] world to condemn the world to judge the
[49:41] world which is exactly what the Jews
[49:43] thought was going to happen right they
[49:45] thought that Jesus their Messiah was
[49:47] going to come and wipe it all off and
[49:49] send us all to heaven and everything was
[49:51] going to be great but that's not why
[49:53] Jesus came he did not come to condemn
[49:56] the world much uh much against what a
[50:00] lot of people even still believe today
[50:03] amen that there's that there's supposed
[50:06] to be that Jesus came for the purpose of
[50:08] judging people that wasn't why he came
[50:11] right he came to save people yes he came
[50:15] that he could live and bleed and die and
[50:18] send back his life so that Humanity
[50:21] would have a shot at being able to go to
[50:23] heaven that they would be able to have a
[50:25] chance to make a Rapture that they would
[50:27] be able to be considered a child of God
[50:31] right he came to save the world not to
[50:34] condemn it amen in fact most of the time
[50:37] if you look at the word if you look at
[50:39] the scripture when Jesus came most the
[50:44] truth of it is anyone that is condemned
[50:46] condemns
[50:48] themselves Jesus doesn't condemn them
[50:50] they condemn themselves that word
[50:53] condemn is Judge basically uh to judge
[50:56] themselves so God did not send his son
[50:58] into the world to judge the world or
[51:00] condemn the world but that the world
[51:02] through him might be saved he come to
[51:05] bring Salvation to us amen now there's a
[51:08] time that that lamb turns into a lion
[51:11] the the the sacrificial lamb to the
[51:14] judgmental lion but that wasn't the
[51:16] reason Jesus came right amen he came to
[51:20] save the world he that believeth on him
[51:23] is is not condemned now now how do you
[51:27] now how do you have the bride going into
[51:30] a Rapture or go going into a
[51:33] tribulation how do you have the bride
[51:35] going through tribulation when right
[51:37] here John Jesus in John's writing he
[51:41] that believeth on him is not
[51:43] condemned is not judged that's exactly
[51:47] the the purpose of the
[51:49] tribulation if the bride is not to be
[51:52] judged then how can you have her going
[51:54] through tribulation amen friends there's
[51:56] just so many scriptures that let us know
[51:59] what what is the truth of the word and
[52:01] the separation between the church and
[52:03] the bride right amen amen between the
[52:07] between the wise virgin and the foolish
[52:09] virgin which we've gone through look he
[52:12] that believeth on him is not condemned
[52:14] is not judged amen that's what happens
[52:17] when he gives us the Holy Spirit yes
[52:20] when we obey his word remember uh
[52:22] complete obedience to the word entitles
[52:24] you to the token what's that complete
[52:27] obedience repent be baptized in the name
[52:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ remission of
[52:31] the sin and you shall receive the Holy
[52:33] Ghost right the gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:36] that's the promise of the word obedience
[52:38] to that word entitles you to that Holy
[52:40] Spirit right obedience to it amen now
[52:44] now God looks down and says when when
[52:47] when the cleansing the burning out of
[52:50] the old nature takes place that's a
[52:52] judgment that burns out the old nature
[52:54] in you and he puts his own life in you
[52:57] that's approving to you it's approving
[52:59] to the world that God has accepted you a
[53:03] lot of people think baptism is salvation
[53:05] friends baptism out isn't salvation
[53:08] without the without the truth and
[53:10] reflection of God's word baptism is
[53:12] nothing more than taking a shower or a
[53:13] bath or going in a hot tub right amen
[53:17] amen true baptism has to have true
[53:21] repentance true repentance baptism in
[53:24] Jesus Christ name brings the Holy Spirit
[53:28] when God brings the holy spirit in you
[53:30] see when we're baptized we show to the
[53:33] world that we've accepted Jesus Christ
[53:35] and that's wonderful but what about his
[53:37] acceptance of you amen I can accept I
[53:41] can accept Elon Musk money all day it's
[53:45] mine but until he comes up and writes me
[53:48] a check you can forget it amen I can
[53:52] claim anything I want to claim but
[53:55] unless he comes and claims me my word is
[53:59] nothing right and I show the world that
[54:03] I accept him amen not a father not a son
[54:06] not a holy ghost not a bunch of titles
[54:08] but I accept him the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:11] and when I show to the world that I've
[54:13] accepted him the Lord Jesus Christ as my
[54:15] savior he shows the world that he's
[54:18] accepted me by putting his Spirit In Me
[54:21] Yes amen now I'm a new creature now I a
[54:25] new person now I've been born again now
[54:28] God is living through me now God is
[54:31] showing through me to the rest of the
[54:33] world that he is the same yesterday
[54:35] today and forever he is the same God now
[54:38] as he has always been through scripture
[54:40] he's not a dead God he's not a god of
[54:42] History he's a god of right now he's a
[54:44] god of right now because of me yes
[54:47] because of you you that's been born
[54:49] again it's because of you he's the god
[54:51] of right now because of us amen so the
[54:56] condemnation is over the judgment is
[54:58] over and we'll read a scripture in a
[55:01] minute sealing of that Spirit shows
[55:05] ownership amen we'll get to it uh here
[55:08] we'll read in just a minute let's finish
[55:10] this though for God sent not his son to
[55:13] the world to condemn the world 18th
[55:15] verse he that believeth on him is not
[55:18] condemned but he that believeth
[55:21] not is condemned already
[55:25] they've done what judged
[55:28] themselves they've judged themselves
[55:30] they're condemned already they're judged
[55:33] already Why by their
[55:35] actions by their by their uh uh by their
[55:38] life they've already shown to through
[55:41] through their soul their Spirit their
[55:43] body they've shown they're condemned
[55:45] already they do it why not C God's done
[55:48] it because they've done it to themselves
[55:51] because they're
[55:53] unbelievers amen amen
[55:55] condemned already because he hath not
[55:58] believed in the name of the only
[56:00] begotten Son of God and this is the
[56:03] condemnation this is the condemnation
[56:05] this is the Judgment the judgment is
[56:08] that light has come into the world but
[56:12] men would love uh but men love Darkness
[56:15] rather than light right yes they would
[56:17] rather walk in darkness than walk in
[56:20] light me and brother Tom was talking
[56:21] yesterday zinka was uh uh a little bit
[56:24] yesterday and and uh about the light and
[56:28] about the way people are today and how
[56:31] difficult it is to try to shed a little
[56:33] light in someone's in someone's pathway
[56:36] anymore um it it's taken me some time
[56:40] but I've made a little enro with my with
[56:42] my uh group that I work with now and I
[56:45] can talk to them about it a little bit
[56:47] you know at first it was just you know
[56:49] if it was just somebody off the street
[56:51] you can forget it right but now that
[56:52] I've gained their confidence they know
[56:54] me and they know know who I am and what
[56:55] kind of person I am I I'm able to speak
[56:58] to them now about these things but
[56:59] normally when you're out on the street
[57:01] or or something like it's very difficult
[57:03] to try to talk about the Lord people
[57:05] don't want to hear it either that or
[57:08] they think that and I've heard this
[57:09] plenty too that however they're living
[57:12] they're going to be okay you know as
[57:14] long as they're this side of Hitler
[57:16] they're going to be fine as long as
[57:18] there's this as long as they're on this
[57:20] side of murdering millions of people or
[57:22] eating people alive or something they're
[57:24] okay you know don't matter how they live
[57:26] or what they do it's going to be I'm
[57:28] going to make heaven anyway but if you
[57:30] don't obey God's word how do you think
[57:32] you're ever going to be pleasing to him
[57:34] if you're not pleasing to him how do you
[57:35] think he's ever going to take you to be
[57:37] with him
[57:38] right amen
[57:41] amen men that but that's the Judgment
[57:44] that's the condemnation that men people
[57:46] like Darkness rather than light they
[57:49] would rather have the darkness of the
[57:50] world than they would Jesus Christ the
[57:52] light of the world right they love
[57:54] Darkness rather than light because their
[57:57] deeds are evil right amen their deeds
[58:00] are even but they enjoy living that way
[58:03] they want to live that way H why because
[58:05] they haven't had a nature change right
[58:07] they haven't had a change they haven't
[58:09] been born again so of course their
[58:12] nature is to love the evil things I
[58:14] sitting here praying this morning think
[58:15] Lord where would I have been without you
[58:18] you know would I would I uh would I be
[58:21] dead right uh would I be the guy on the
[58:24] corner over here here begging for a
[58:25] dollar at the corner of Orland River
[58:28] what what what kind of life would I be
[58:33] would I spent my night in the in the
[58:35] wash down here under some little tarp or
[58:37] something on on a rock what kind of Life
[58:41] who would I be but I don't even want to
[58:43] think about that right amen but people
[58:48] today believe that they're right I I I
[58:51] truly believe that a lot of people feel
[58:54] like what they're doing is okay in a lot
[58:56] of ways uh you talk about the government
[59:00] things like that I think I think a lot
[59:01] of those people that even though our
[59:04] country is going down the toilet uh I
[59:06] think a lot of people they they actually
[59:07] think they're doing right right they I I
[59:10] believe somehow in their minds uh that
[59:13] that that they believe that they're okay
[59:15] you know and when I was living in the
[59:16] world I didn't see any different either
[59:19] I I I thought I was fine I I thought I
[59:22] would be okay before the Lord put his
[59:24] spirit in me and I I I thought
[59:28] everything was fine I was you know
[59:30] everything's going to be okay I'm a good
[59:32] person I'm a decent person I I haven't
[59:35] murdered anybody
[59:37] lately I I I haven't I haven't uh
[59:41] plundered or stolen or uh plowed over a
[59:45] parade of people I've been I've been a
[59:47] good boy I've been a good guy surely God
[59:49] will be a doesn't work that way right
[59:52] amen because the bottom line of it is is
[59:55] my soul still desired the things that
[59:57] were wrong the things that were evil the
[1:00:00] things that were evil what is what
[1:00:03] constitutes evil anything that is
[1:00:06] against Christ in his word amen is evil
[1:00:09] yes amen it's Antichrist if it's against
[1:00:12] him against his word is Antichrist and
[1:00:14] anything that's against him is evil
[1:00:18] praise the Lord so how do you know not
[1:00:19] to do evil know what his word says live
[1:00:23] by the scripture live by the word live
[1:00:25] by what Jesus and how Jesus told us to
[1:00:28] live amen amen and what was the first
[1:00:32] thing he said in St John
[1:00:33] 3 he told Nicodemus you must be born
[1:00:39] again amen praise the lord it's the only
[1:00:43] way it can happen only way it can happen
[1:00:46] is you must be born again Born Again wow
[1:00:50] that's that's a step or two Beyond just
[1:00:53] believing amen Jesus said you must be
[1:00:57] born again that's a good bit beyond just
[1:01:00] believing that Jesus is which we look
[1:01:03] John 3:15-16
[1:01:05] believeth it's a lot more than just
[1:01:07] believing amen or just believing in his
[1:01:11] existence not trying to change the word
[1:01:14] I'm just trying to help us understand
[1:01:15] there's a deeper understanding to even
[1:01:18] what the word believe or believeth is
[1:01:20] than what we look at on the
[1:01:22] surface amen for everyone that doth evil
[1:01:25] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[1:01:27] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:01:31] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[1:01:33] light that his deeds may be made
[1:01:35] manifest that they are wrought in God
[1:01:38] right praise the Lord what we do we do
[1:01:40] for him amen we live for him we live for
[1:01:45] others of course we live for others
[1:01:46] we're staring heaven in the face we live
[1:01:48] for others we're living for him amen
[1:01:50] amen that's what his life was right amen
[1:01:54] if his life was living for others I
[1:01:55] should be the same way amen and when we
[1:01:58] live for him live for others we're
[1:02:00] living for him let's go over to
[1:02:01] Ephesians
[1:02:03] now Ephesians chapter
[1:02:07] 1 my point here
[1:02:09] is it there's more to it than just
[1:02:12] believing in the existence of God
[1:02:15] there's more to it than just believing
[1:02:17] in the existence of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:20] there's a there's a holy consecrated
[1:02:23] righteous
[1:02:25] life of the Holy Ghost that follows that
[1:02:29] amen praise the Lord let's look at this
[1:02:32] now uh Ephesians chapter 1 verse 12
[1:02:36] Ephesians
[1:02:38] 1:12 that we should be to the praise of
[1:02:40] his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:02:44] trusted have faith have confidence hope
[1:02:47] in Jesus Christ in whom ye also trusted
[1:02:52] had faith in belief in uh trust after
[1:02:56] after
[1:02:58] after amen amen
[1:03:00] after that you heard the word of
[1:03:04] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[1:03:07] whom Christ in whom also
[1:03:12] after amen not when after that ye
[1:03:18] believed ye were sealed with the Holy
[1:03:21] Spirit of promise right the belief in
[1:03:25] God the belief in Christ the belief in
[1:03:27] the word is just what brings you it's
[1:03:30] the vehicle that leads you to where you
[1:03:33] need to go to be able to be born again
[1:03:36] to receive the holy spirit amen after
[1:03:40] that ye
[1:03:41] believe amen now the word does not
[1:03:44] contradict itself you have to understand
[1:03:47] the contradiction or the truth of God's
[1:03:50] word to alleviate the contradiction it
[1:03:53] doesn't say one thing one place and
[1:03:55] something else some other place amen
[1:03:58] that's why by Revelation it gets you to
[1:04:00] believing that once you believe in
[1:04:03] Christ full obedience entitles you to
[1:04:05] the Holy Spirit the token after that you
[1:04:08] believe you were sealed with the Holy
[1:04:11] Spirit of Promise remember that seal we
[1:04:12] talked about a few months back I can't
[1:04:16] remember when that seal remember that
[1:04:18] seal denotes one of the reasons of that
[1:04:20] seal is it denotes
[1:04:22] ownership so when God put his spirit in
[1:04:25] you he showed to the world that he's
[1:04:26] accepted you as as one of his he sealed
[1:04:29] you with the Holy Spirit of promise that
[1:04:31] Holy Spirit itself is literally a seal
[1:04:35] it seals God in and seals the devil out
[1:04:39] it is also a seal of
[1:04:42] ownership amen it shows ownership that
[1:04:45] that seal proves that you belong to God
[1:04:48] you don't belong to the devil no matter
[1:04:51] how much the devil try to convince you
[1:04:53] of it you do not belong to the devil you
[1:04:56] belong to Jesus Christ that seal proves
[1:05:00] it who are you I'm a Child of God yes
[1:05:04] I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I'm a I'm
[1:05:07] I'm a born I'm more than just a believer
[1:05:10] I'm a born again believer amen praise
[1:05:14] the Lord sealed that ownership proves
[1:05:19] that you belong to God that seal with
[1:05:22] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit itself
[1:05:25] is the seal now that is 14th verse that
[1:05:29] is which is the earnest of our
[1:05:33] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:05:35] purchased possession the earnest of our
[1:05:39] inheritance what is our inheritance
[1:05:40] Christ the word all that comes with that
[1:05:43] you say well my inheritance is is heaven
[1:05:47] and and and and the the the the H the
[1:05:51] the house and the uh on in the New
[1:05:55] Jerusalem or my inheritance is seeing
[1:05:58] all my loved ones again every bit of
[1:06:01] what God blessings to you funnels right
[1:06:04] down to one thing and that's Christ
[1:06:07] right amen amen the promise of your
[1:06:10] inheritance is Christ the word Jesus
[1:06:13] Christ to you the earnest is a down
[1:06:16] payment the holy spirit is a down
[1:06:20] payment it's a down payment of your
[1:06:23] inheritance
[1:06:25] so the Holy Spirit comes to you as a
[1:06:27] temporal gift amen you know what that
[1:06:30] means a temporal gift is a gift that God
[1:06:33] gives you for a period of time amen amen
[1:06:38] it's for us until we leave this place
[1:06:43] amen the Holy Spirit comes in us until
[1:06:48] we leave here amen amen it's our ticket
[1:06:50] it's our token yes amen you know what
[1:06:53] happens when I go on on a flight every
[1:06:54] other week they give me a ticket
[1:06:57] nowadays it's on my phone but sometimes
[1:06:59] I I'll go up and give my license and
[1:07:03] without asking they'll print me a paper
[1:07:04] ticket I have a paper I'll get a paper
[1:07:06] ticket most of the time it's on my phone
[1:07:08] but I get a paper ticket like the lady
[1:07:10] did last week she give me a paper ticket
[1:07:11] didn't ask for it but that ticket
[1:07:15] entitles me to get on the plane right I
[1:07:18] can go through security I can go through
[1:07:20] the gate I can get on the plane because
[1:07:23] I have the ticket
[1:07:24] because I have a seal of ownership that
[1:07:26] proves that I have I have a legal right
[1:07:29] to get on this plane that's that's our
[1:07:33] agreement between the airline and myself
[1:07:36] is that I paid the fair and you gave me
[1:07:39] the ticket and this proves that I am one
[1:07:42] of
[1:07:43] them praise the Lord uh mine even gives
[1:07:46] me the seat that I'm supposed to sit in
[1:07:48] but I have a ride on the plane amen far
[1:07:51] as the Good Ship of Zion I don't care
[1:07:53] what what seat I have as long as I'm on
[1:07:55] it uh but uh that ticket tells me now
[1:08:00] when I use that ticket and I get on the
[1:08:04] plane I go to my destination when I get
[1:08:07] to my destination what used to I have
[1:08:09] the ticket
[1:08:10] anymore I don't need the plane ticket
[1:08:13] anymore put it through a Sher throw it
[1:08:15] to garbage whatever I can do whatever I
[1:08:17] want to with it cuz it's irrelevant
[1:08:20] anymore I don't need the ticket anymore
[1:08:22] I've gotten to my Destin Nation the holy
[1:08:25] spirit is an Earnest it's a down payment
[1:08:29] of The
[1:08:30] Inheritance but it is until now let's
[1:08:34] finish the scripture to help back up
[1:08:36] what I just said with my ticket story
[1:08:40] until the Redemption of the purchased
[1:08:44] possession who's the purchased
[1:08:45] possession I am amen you are yes you're
[1:08:50] the purchase you're the one that Jesus
[1:08:52] came to save you're the Fulfillment of
[1:08:54] St John uh
[1:08:56] 3:16 he came uh 3:17 he came in the
[1:08:59] world to save
[1:09:01] you you are the one who was bought by
[1:09:05] with a price by the blood of Jesus
[1:09:07] Christ you are that purchased possession
[1:09:10] the earnest night gives us the Holy
[1:09:12] Ghost as an Earnest as a down payment
[1:09:16] amen of our inheritance until the
[1:09:19] Redemption of the purchased possession
[1:09:21] now if you go by a house you give
[1:09:23] earnest money earnest money allows you
[1:09:26] the opportunity to purchase the house it
[1:09:28] it gives you a deed it gives you a uh
[1:09:31] the keys to the door and you can go and
[1:09:32] you can occupy that house but that house
[1:09:34] isn't yours you can occupy it you can
[1:09:37] live in it you can enjoy all the
[1:09:39] benefits of that beautiful house but
[1:09:42] it's not yours
[1:09:44] until the price is fully
[1:09:46] paid amen when the price is fully paid
[1:09:50] of course in this country nobody really
[1:09:51] ever homs anything because you don't pay
[1:09:53] your taxes they're going to take it
[1:09:54] anyway but theoretically it's supposed
[1:09:57] to be yours and you own it no Bank can
[1:10:01] come and take it from you because it
[1:10:03] belongs to you now but you only have an
[1:10:06] Earnest that's a down payment until
[1:10:10] until again our until the Redemption of
[1:10:14] the purchased possession the taking over
[1:10:17] of what was purchased unto the praise of
[1:10:21] his glory now and uh if we go over I
[1:10:24] wasn't going to do this but I want to go
[1:10:27] to Romans chapter 8 real
[1:10:30] quick because this Falls so perfectly in
[1:10:33] line with what Paul wrote in Romans to
[1:10:36] the Roman Church uh verse 23 Romans
[1:10:42] 8:23 Romans 8:23 says uh let's start
[1:10:46] with 22 for we know that the whole
[1:10:49] creation granth and travaileth in pain
[1:10:52] together until now now so it's still
[1:10:55] groaning and travailing in pain right
[1:10:58] now what's it what is all of creation
[1:11:00] groaning and travailing about well there
[1:11:04] was a time when creation animals all
[1:11:08] bought me life there was a time at the
[1:11:11] point of creation where there was no
[1:11:14] death death only entered in after the
[1:11:17] fall of Man when man fell that's when
[1:11:21] death entered in on animals plant but
[1:11:23] life animal life human life that's when
[1:11:25] death entered in but there was a time
[1:11:29] when there was no death there was a time
[1:11:32] before where the lamb could lay down
[1:11:34] with the lion and there was there was no
[1:11:36] death amen no thorns on rose bushes uh
[1:11:41] those of you who love your blessed
[1:11:42] desert out here God bless you uh there's
[1:11:45] thorns on every cotton picking thing
[1:11:47] that there is out on this earth right
[1:11:50] here I told people when I took them up
[1:11:52] to the mountains I said
[1:11:54] uh uh when I take them hiking they're
[1:11:56] from another place especially back East
[1:11:57] I said don't touch a thing I don't care
[1:12:00] how fluffy it looks I don't care how
[1:12:02] pretty it looks I don't care how much
[1:12:03] you want to I don't care if it looks
[1:12:05] like a ball of cotton don't touch it cuz
[1:12:07] it will sticker you because pretty much
[1:12:10] everything in the desert has stickers so
[1:12:13] I'm sorry but when we go where we're
[1:12:15] going there's not going to be a sticker
[1:12:17] desert so if you love it here I
[1:12:20] apologize but it's not going to be like
[1:12:22] that over there all that's done away
[1:12:24] with that death did not come in till
[1:12:26] after the fall all of creation is
[1:12:29] groaning and travailing together all
[1:12:32] animals life is groaning and travailing
[1:12:35] together until that time look the whole
[1:12:38] Creation in pain together still even now
[1:12:42] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:12:46] amen don't you feel that groaning in
[1:12:48] yourself yes knowing that this is not
[1:12:50] your destination knowing that this is
[1:12:53] not your your inheritance knowing that
[1:12:54] this is not where you belong you feel a
[1:12:57] groaning in yourself that says that I'm
[1:12:59] simply a pilgrim here this is not my
[1:13:02] house this is not my place of residence
[1:13:04] this is not where I belong amen amen I
[1:13:07] belong in a place that's holy and pure
[1:13:09] and righteous where there is no death
[1:13:12] where there is no pain where there is no
[1:13:14] hatred amen not a grave No Grave ever
[1:13:18] touch that soil you'll never hear the
[1:13:20] siren uh the ringing of a siren going
[1:13:22] down the road anymore you'll never see
[1:13:25] uh more and more and more uh uh urgent
[1:13:29] cares pop up all over the place
[1:13:32] hospitals and you'll never see that
[1:13:35] you'll never see a police station why no
[1:13:37] need for it right that's the place I
[1:13:39] want to go to I've had people tell me or
[1:13:41] I've heard people say oh that sounds
[1:13:43] boring well then you go where you want
[1:13:44] to go and I'll go where I want to go but
[1:13:46] that sounds like paradise to me amen but
[1:13:51] look even we ourselves there's a
[1:13:53] groaning which have the first fruits of
[1:13:56] the spirit the Holy Spirit even we
[1:13:58] ourselves are groaning with ourselves
[1:14:00] waiting for the adoption to it or that
[1:14:04] is to say the Redemption of our
[1:14:08] bodies the Redemption of our bodies when
[1:14:11] our bodies are redeemed when there's a
[1:14:13] when there's a change in the moment and
[1:14:15] twinkling of an eye and we go in a
[1:14:17] Rapture to meet the Lord in the air all
[1:14:19] the groaning is

[1:15:38] virgin has has oil in their vessel their
[1:15:42] soul they're born again yes the
[1:15:44] difference amen amen between the
[1:15:46] believer unbeliever between the bride

[1:16:01] church if thou believest he said the
[1:16:04] devil believes not make believes but he

[1:16:15] he told first uh such Divine he there is
[1:16:18] no such thing we can prove that there's
[1:16:21] uh been a case proved this baptism in
[1:16:24] Jesus name now don't you realize the
[1:16:26] author that the authority of the church

[1:16:31] unclean three unclean spirits went out
[1:16:34] dragons false prophets so forth we
[1:16:37] believe uh we believe that there well
[1:16:40] maybe we should leave that
[1:16:42] alone we believe that there is a trinity
[1:16:45] of gods he oh for goodness sake that's
[1:16:47] as Heathen as can be don't you ever come
[1:16:52] uh before God with such thing as that

[1:17:09] Lord look
[1:17:11] now this gets kind of touchy so bear
[1:17:15] with me be not afraid he say can't stand
[1:17:18] nothing in the beginning you see what
[1:17:20] you need is original don't dig uh old
[1:17:23] digging out tearing down amen I believe
[1:17:27] that's what happens from time to time
[1:17:29] sometimes you just got to dig down to
[1:17:31] the
[1:17:32] foundation as I said last night clean
[1:17:34] out the nest start over again that's
[1:17:36] right you can make deacons out of them
[1:17:38] everything else that'll never do no good
[1:17:40] Pat them on the back uh hot bed plants
[1:17:44] amen you got to Baby them hot bed plants
[1:17:46] uh Pat them on the back call them
[1:17:48] brother uh but until they're born again
[1:17:51] of the spirit of God they're just nest
[1:17:53] full of rotten eggs that's all never
[1:17:55] hatched we need the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:17:58] mean some dry handshake said have you
[1:18:01] have you uh did you get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:04] yeah when I shook hands with the pastor
[1:18:06] no when I accepted Jesus as my savior no
[1:18:10] brother that ain't Bible doctor Paul
[1:18:12] found a bunch of good Thoroughbred
[1:18:14] Baptists up there and he said have you
[1:18:16] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:18:18] believe that's scripture now right uh
[1:18:21] not when you believe but but after you
[1:18:23] believed after you've received after
[1:18:26] that you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:18:30] receive now it reminds me of the of the
[1:18:34] quote that he gave I didn't print it
[1:18:37] out just thinking on that word
[1:18:41] receive you can see
[1:18:44] here until we receive until you're
[1:18:47] sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise
[1:18:50] the the the purchased possession amen
[1:18:53] that we received from
[1:18:56] God before I get that let's go over to
[1:18:59] St John I I want to read this scripture
[1:19:01] to give a little more of a foundation on
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] though first John chapter uh or excuse
[1:19:08] me not first John St John chapter
[1:19:10] 1 St John chapter
[1:19:18] one St John chapter 1 I want to start
[1:19:21] with verse n
[1:19:25] let me give a little bit more of a
[1:19:26] foundation on here before we continue
[1:19:29] on and again we're we're looking at and
[1:19:32] reflecting on the John 3:15-16
[1:19:37] believeth simply a belief of existence
[1:19:40] let's look uh St John 1:9 that was the
[1:19:44] True Light which lith every man that
[1:19:46] cometh into the
[1:19:48] world he was in the world and the world
[1:19:50] was made by him and the world knew knew
[1:19:53] him
[1:19:54] not he came unto his own and his own
[1:19:58] received him
[1:19:59] not but as many look now but as many as
[1:20:03] received there we go with that same word
[1:20:06] again as many as received not believed
[1:20:09] but received him to them gave he power
[1:20:15] power or not just power but Authority he
[1:20:18] gave them the authority to become the
[1:20:21] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:20:23] his name even to them that believe what
[1:20:26] did they go on and do their belief
[1:20:29] brought them to a reception they
[1:20:31] believed in God and received God so it
[1:20:34] wasn't just simple oh I believe God
[1:20:36] exists I say I'm saved
[1:20:39] no you must come to the place God gave
[1:20:43] to those who receive him now he gave
[1:20:46] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:20:48] them that believe on his name which were
[1:20:50] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[1:20:53] flesh nor of the will of man but born of
[1:20:57] God which Jesus tells them Nicodemus
[1:21:01] again St John 3 you must be born again
[1:21:07] amen must be born again to those who do
[1:21:11] what who receive him what is the
[1:21:14] receiving amen what is it you receive
[1:21:17] again it makes me think now I want to
[1:21:19] tell this
[1:21:21] quote it may it reminds me of the time
[1:21:25] that brother Brandon was wrestling with
[1:21:28] the evidence of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:21:31] because he came up in the Baptist Church
[1:21:33] uh weaned in the Baptist Church came up
[1:21:35] in the Pentecostal church and you go to
[1:21:38] the Baptist church and they just they
[1:21:40] just believe when you accept it baptized
[1:21:42] believe it you've got it well the
[1:21:44] Pentecostals believe you got to speak in
[1:21:46] tongue there's got to be an Evidence of
[1:21:48] some kind you got to speak in tongues
[1:21:51] you speaking in tongues that was was
[1:21:52] then by adopted by the Pentecostal
[1:21:55] domination church that that is the
[1:21:58] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost right
[1:22:02] and brother bam knew that was wrong
[1:22:04] because it's not scriptural
[1:22:07] right so then he goes to think what
[1:22:09] would what would
[1:22:11] be uh the evidence let's just not talk
[1:22:15] about an Evidence but the initial
[1:22:17] evidence that's that's kind of the
[1:22:18] phraseology of it in the in the
[1:22:21] Pentecostal ranks with the with the
[1:22:22] speaking in tongues it's the initial
[1:22:25] evidence they say of the Holy Ghost he
[1:22:28] said that can be right because that's
[1:22:29] not scripture so what might it be so I
[1:22:33] thought love well if you could really
[1:22:35] display the love of God the true love of
[1:22:37] God then you know that that would
[1:22:39] probably the best thing that I'd know of
[1:22:41] that you've got the Holy Ghost would
[1:22:43] just be that love amen he come to find
[1:22:47] out that many a good old
[1:22:49] priest that obviously hadn't obeyed the
[1:22:52] word to receive the Holy Ghost could
[1:22:54] produce as much love as as even Jesus
[1:22:58] Christ when he was here amen yes you go
[1:23:00] to a monastery and try to outlive any
[1:23:03] one of those monks I Dare
[1:23:05] You amen
[1:23:07] amen are they born again I don't
[1:23:10] know I I I know what they
[1:23:13] believe uh uh spiritually is not going
[1:23:17] to bring them to a new birth I know that
[1:23:20] amen but I'm not going say they're not
[1:23:23] cuz I'm not their judge right but what
[1:23:26] they believe can't bring them to that
[1:23:28] place but you you go
[1:23:31] to go to a monastery a monk or uh even
[1:23:36] someone like a sister Teresa put a put a
[1:23:39] put a finger on her
[1:23:41] life and he started to think well you
[1:23:44] know all kinds of people produce love
[1:23:47] all kinds of people show and manifest
[1:23:49] that love he went to LEL and said what
[1:23:51] do you thinking he said I thought it'd
[1:23:53] be love he said yeah that sounds great
[1:23:54] to me he said okay then he then he still
[1:23:57] decided Well you know I'll just go with
[1:23:59] that it would just just believe that
[1:24:02] that type of manifestation of love that
[1:24:04] would be the best initial evidence of
[1:24:05] the Holy Ghost then he said the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost
[1:24:09] came God came and told him different and
[1:24:13] said it's no longer it is not speaking
[1:24:15] in tongues it is not the display of that
[1:24:17] love it is receiving the word for your
[1:24:21] day amen
[1:24:24] receiving amen not hearing but receiving
[1:24:28] you can hear something you can believe
[1:24:31] it but when you walk out the door are
[1:24:33] you going to live it right amen if you
[1:24:37] don't walk you can believe it all you
[1:24:39] want you can hear it all you want you
[1:24:41] can believe it all you want but would
[1:24:42] you walk out the door are you going to
[1:24:43] receive it did you receive it to where
[1:24:46] you're going to actually live it I've
[1:24:48] gone through the the the uh the the
[1:24:51] display before and taking my pen and you
[1:24:53] know give it to
[1:24:55] somebody and and just drop it in their
[1:24:58] lap so well I I I give you this pen but
[1:25:00] unless you take the pen and you put it
[1:25:02] in action you haven't received it from
[1:25:04] me it's just something that's sitting in
[1:25:06] your life just like a moth could fly on
[1:25:08] your lap or a fly or it it means nothing
[1:25:11] more than that right but do you receive
[1:25:14] it receiving is believing something
[1:25:17] enough that you know that when you when
[1:25:19] you live your life that's how you're
[1:25:20] going to live that's what you're going
[1:25:21] to do
[1:25:22] that's how you're going to conduct
[1:25:24] yourself receive is to uh to is to make
[1:25:28] one's own if you look if you look up in
[1:25:30] the Greek that word receive is to make
[1:25:35] one uh to make it your your own is what
[1:25:39] it says it says to make one's own but
[1:25:41] that's to make it your own
[1:25:45] ownership you take you take
[1:25:47] responsibility for it when when the word
[1:25:50] says to them that receive receive him
[1:25:53] it's not just why I believe that God is
[1:25:55] no but have you received him what does
[1:25:58] that mean that means that when you walk
[1:26:00] out into this world you're going to live
[1:26:02] the life of the word amen of Jesus
[1:26:04] Christ the word you're going to live and
[1:26:06] you're going to obey it because that's
[1:26:08] who you become because you don't only
[1:26:10] have just believed it you've received it
[1:26:14] receiving something brings it a part of
[1:26:16] you it makes you who you are it's like
[1:26:18] it's like we've said many times about
[1:26:19] revelation God Reveals His word to you
[1:26:21] that Revelation becomes a part of who
[1:26:24] you are yes amen it's not just something
[1:26:26] you do it's who you are it's not
[1:26:29] something you think or believe it's who
[1:26:31] you are when it becomes who you are then
[1:26:33] all you do is live your
[1:26:36] life amen then you you just live your
[1:26:40] life and now living your life is is is
[1:26:45] living by the word you walk and talk and
[1:26:48] live and act and do because of what is
[1:26:50] in you because of what the word says
[1:26:52] because you have not just believed it
[1:26:55] but you've received it amen not just oh
[1:26:59] I believe what he's saying but then go
[1:27:01] outside and do just the
[1:27:04] opposite amen a lot of people do that
[1:27:07] you see it all the time amen I remember
[1:27:11] growing up in and we would go to my my
[1:27:15] my parents where where they were raised
[1:27:18] and the the family Baptist Church where
[1:27:21] my dad and my mom and my sister and my
[1:27:22] son are all buried right now in that
[1:27:26] church and I remember as a
[1:27:28] kid and we went here what well that's
[1:27:32] probably been close to a year ago now we
[1:27:33] went back up there and the same things
[1:27:36] were there but when I was a kid when I
[1:27:40] was no more than Gabriel's age I go to
[1:27:43] this church and you walk outside and
[1:27:46] there's two big white pots on both sides
[1:27:48] of the doors when you go outside the
[1:27:49] church you know what those big pots full
[1:27:51] of sand are for to dump their ashes and
[1:27:54] their cigarette butts
[1:27:56] in because the first thing they wanted
[1:27:58] to do after hearing this Godly message
[1:28:01] was to walk out the door and puff on a
[1:28:04] cigarette and the church literally had
[1:28:07] two big white pots on each side of the
[1:28:09] door for that purpose now I don't
[1:28:12] begrudge somebody if you go to church if
[1:28:14] the Lord hasn't hasn't corrected you or
[1:28:17] hasn't delivered you from that yet then
[1:28:19] I understand you just keep coming to
[1:28:21] church I got criticized in St Augustine
[1:28:23] one time cuz I baptized a man who was
[1:28:25] still smoking cigarettes right and I got
[1:28:27] down the country for it I said I said
[1:28:31] well brother Brown did the same thing
[1:28:32] well you're not brother Brown you know
[1:28:34] people are just going to be critical but
[1:28:36] I said I know if somebody asks me they
[1:28:38] want to get baptized I'm not going to
[1:28:40] begr them to getting baptized come right
[1:28:41] on the head baptism is not between me
[1:28:44] and you it's between you and God right
[1:28:46] I'm just here to facilitate
[1:28:48] it amen that's between you and him so I
[1:28:52] wouldn't say no the brother wanted to be
[1:28:54] baptized I baptized him did he later
[1:28:57] kick it yeah he did yeah but I'm not
[1:28:59] saying that but I'm just saying the
[1:29:02] whole the whole setup of the thing was
[1:29:05] they knew that's what they did they
[1:29:06] weren't going to change didn't matter
[1:29:08] what was said behind the pulpit they
[1:29:10] said oh yeah that's great preacher
[1:29:12] didn't go out and live just contrary to
[1:29:13] what you just heard they said well
[1:29:15] wasn't so great after all was it wasn't
[1:29:17] great enough for you to receive it you
[1:29:20] might have believed it to be the truth
[1:29:21] but did you take it
[1:29:23] in did you desire to become what it said
[1:29:27] did you desire to let your life be
[1:29:29] molded into that image to receive not
[1:29:32] just believe but receive God help us to
[1:29:36] receive it two scriptures I want to read
[1:29:40] I'll close here in just a minute acts
[1:29:41] 238 very popular scripture that we have
[1:29:43] that we read all the time
[1:29:46] amen also a scripture that I never heard
[1:29:50] while I was in the Baptist Church
[1:29:53] acts 238 it's always John 3:16 never
[1:29:56] acts 238 Alice Gabriel I want you to be
[1:29:59] able to memorize that scripture and
[1:30:02] quote it to your mom and daddy acts
[1:30:05] 238 uh John 3:16 is important too there
[1:30:08] I'm not I'm not putting one importance
[1:30:09] over the other but I never heard that
[1:30:11] when I was a
[1:30:13] kid till I got older of course and we
[1:30:15] came into the truth and then acts 213
[1:30:18] became a very uh 238 became a very
[1:30:21] important scripture to us Peter now
[1:30:25] look then Peter said unto them repent
[1:30:29] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:30:32] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:30:34] of your sins and ye shall receive the
[1:30:38] gift of the Holy Ghost AM you shall
[1:30:41] receive
[1:30:42] what a
[1:30:44] gift what did we say before amen it
[1:30:48] didn't say gift but notice what it did
[1:30:51] say now now we're finding in the
[1:30:52] scripture that even Peter on the day of
[1:30:55] Pentecost is calling the Holy Ghost it's
[1:30:58] a gift it's something God gives you to
[1:31:01] be able to uh to live his life while
[1:31:04] you're here in this human
[1:31:06] flesh when this human flesh sheds
[1:31:10] itself what is in your soul is be is who
[1:31:13] you
[1:31:14] are what that's the Holy Ghost amen
[1:31:18] that's why it says
[1:31:20] until the Redemption of the purchased
[1:31:25] possession what's the Redemption means
[1:31:27] god takes us back with him takes us home
[1:31:30] right amen we go to be with him that's
[1:31:34] that's the UN part the Lord here Peter
[1:31:37] says it's a gift Amen brother brandom
[1:31:40] called it a remember I said before
[1:31:43] because brother brandom called it a
[1:31:45] temporal gift what does that mean that
[1:31:47] means it started here and it will be
[1:31:49] over here amen in every one of our Lives
[1:31:53] it probably started at a different time
[1:31:55] when you were born again and receive the
[1:31:58] holy ghost that gift amen but it'll all
[1:32:02] end I shall I say uh at the same time
[1:32:06] unless we go by the way of the Grave
[1:32:09] amen it'll all end when we go home to be
[1:32:12] with him until this purchased possession
[1:32:15] is fully
[1:32:16] redeemed amen we we have need of that
[1:32:20] gift we have have need of that Holy
[1:32:22] Spirit in fact it is the must Jesus said
[1:32:26] Must Praise the Lord I I dareon try to
[1:32:30] go to my flight this afternoon without a
[1:32:33] ticket I'd probably be arrested I mean
[1:32:36] first thing that would do is tell me no
[1:32:38] you can't go I have I have no I have no
[1:32:42] name like that under
[1:32:45] reservation amen people used to be when
[1:32:47] I was growing up they talked about Peter
[1:32:49] at the Pearly Gates and having a name
[1:32:52] a role that he was writing people's
[1:32:53] names who are you come
[1:32:56] on anyway nice story but not scriptural
[1:33:01] right but if I went over there they'
[1:33:03] just say I have no record of you Mr
[1:33:07] Bennett of taking this flight today I
[1:33:10] won't get on that plane no matter
[1:33:12] what amen they won't let me
[1:33:15] on but if I had the token if I had the
[1:33:19] ticket if I had the Holy Ghost they
[1:33:21] can't keep me off I mean unless
[1:33:24] something wrong with a plane or
[1:33:25] something but they can't just take off
[1:33:27] in the flight and say oh we're just not
[1:33:29] taking you you're just too ugly um we
[1:33:32] don't like your voice which all things
[1:33:34] could be true but that's not enough to
[1:33:36] keep me off that plane because I paid
[1:33:38] the price right amen and it's until that
[1:33:43] gift is until look uh back in Ephesians
[1:33:46] chapter
[1:33:48] 2 uh Ephesians 2:8 for by Grace are you
[1:33:52] saved through faith and that not of
[1:33:55] yourselves it is what
[1:33:59] gift praise the lord it's a gift by
[1:34:03] grace are you saved through faith
[1:34:06] salvation through faith is a gift amen
[1:34:11] the holy spirit is a gift amen God gives
[1:34:14] us that gift to keep us in this life
[1:34:18] because it's of the importance that we
[1:34:20] need that
[1:34:22] that the Holy Spirit In Our Lives
[1:34:27] look Judas is Carri
[1:34:30] it judas's car was
[1:34:34] justified amen he was
[1:34:37] Sanctified he was right there with the
[1:34:40] rest of them when they did all the
[1:34:42] Miracles amen you go look in the
[1:34:44] scripture I give I could give you the
[1:34:45] the the scriptural reference to
[1:34:48] recognize you so how do you know he was
[1:34:50] this that and the other well the
[1:34:52] scripture tells us it was I didn't write
[1:34:54] the scriptures down but the scripture
[1:34:56] tells us the point that that he was that
[1:34:58] they were Justified and Sanctified I
[1:35:00] mean Jesus even told him sanctify them
[1:35:02] by Thy word Thy word is true and Je
[1:35:05] Judas was sitting sitting right there
[1:35:07] with him Justified Sanctified oh that's
[1:35:09] great I believe well that's that's a
[1:35:12] good step I believe that God exists okay
[1:35:15] let's get a little beyond what the devil
[1:35:17] believes for a minute amen amen to
[1:35:20] actually receive something
[1:35:22] salvation justification sanctification
[1:35:25] but he could not go on to the upper room
[1:35:28] to receive the Holy Ghost he sold his
[1:35:30] Lord out for 30 pieces of silver and he
[1:35:31] hung himself amen
[1:35:36] look uh question
[1:35:39] answers
[1:35:40] 1954 oh I hope you don't get angry with
[1:35:44] me but just something just real plain
[1:35:46] for a moment I just got to say it
[1:35:48] because it keeps choking me see got to
[1:35:51] say it now look uh then I'm going to say
[1:35:54] this there's a people that believe in
[1:35:57] justification by faith see and they live
[1:35:59] a good clean holy life they believe in
[1:36:01] sanctification too absolutely that's
[1:36:04] wonderful that's there there's
[1:36:07] justification uh is the is the first
[1:36:11] step important step to getting to
[1:36:15] Salvation getting to being born again a
[1:36:18] new birth does not come without
[1:36:20] justification amen
[1:36:22] there has to be a slate that's wiped
[1:36:23] clean sanctification that has to be the
[1:36:26] second step without the S without being
[1:36:28] justified and Sanctified you'll never
[1:36:30] receive the Holy Ghost amen so yeah
[1:36:32] those are two very important parts but
[1:36:35] that's not what Jesus said Jesus did not
[1:36:38] tell Nicodemus you must be justified no
[1:36:42] you must be Sanctified no he said you
[1:36:45] must be born again justification
[1:36:47] sanctification are just steps that lead
[1:36:49] you to that realization to be able to
[1:36:52] receive that just like our Podium here
[1:36:54] which I believe Daniel was inspired to
[1:36:56] make for us three steps to the Cross
[1:36:59] three steps to Salvation justification
[1:37:01] sanctification the Holy Ghost amen
[1:37:04] that's Christ amen praise the Lord look
[1:37:07] now judas's carot was justified when he
[1:37:10] believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:37:13] believe
[1:37:15] believe
[1:37:17] amen and accepted him as his personal
[1:37:20] savior Judas his car Sanctified St John
[1:37:23] 17:17 uh like I said San of Jesus said
[1:37:26] sanctify them by Thy word Thy word is
[1:37:28] the truth was given power in Matthew 10
[1:37:30] to go out and cast out Devils Judas
[1:37:32] Hisar came back uh his scariot came back
[1:37:35] after he healed the sick cast out Devils
[1:37:37] came back rejoicing shouting just as
[1:37:39] many just as much as any good holy role
[1:37:41] you ever seen that right Bible said he
[1:37:43] did amen but when he come to Pentecost
[1:37:47] he showed his colors he could not go to
[1:37:50] the upper room he did not receive a new
[1:37:53] birth yes and without the new birth
[1:37:55] friend I'm afraid that a lot of people
[1:37:57] are going to be disappointed yes amen
[1:38:01] disappointed in thinking that they had
[1:38:03] something they did not have because they
[1:38:06] had something that was simply just I
[1:38:08] believe that he is I believe that God
[1:38:14] exists that person has no more than the
[1:38:17] devil's
[1:38:18] God Amen I believe that God can do this
[1:38:21] that and the other devil knows he can oh
[1:38:24] I believe God's a miracle working God
[1:38:26] absolutely don't you think the devil
[1:38:28] knows that God works
[1:38:30] miracles
[1:38:32] amen God is uh God will be a god of
[1:38:37] judgment don't you think Satan knows
[1:38:39] that amen he was cast out of heaven and
[1:38:42] down onto the Earth with him and his
[1:38:44] followers he knows that he's felt
[1:38:48] it but there's one thing the devil
[1:38:50] cannot do and that's come through the
[1:38:51] blood and be your brother amen he cannot
[1:38:54] get to the place of being born again yes
[1:38:57] amen because that just like Judas is
[1:39:00] where he showed his colors right cannot
[1:39:03] be born again the Bible says Jesus said
[1:39:06] you must be born again yes amen amen
[1:39:09] praise the Lord now I must add this as I
[1:39:12] close
[1:39:14] here and I've said this before but I
[1:39:16] feel compelled to say it again we
[1:39:19] understand and recognize now that all
[1:39:21] all babies go to
[1:39:22] heaven it does not mean they're
[1:39:24] predestinated but until a child comes to
[1:39:27] the point of of accountability till they
[1:39:30] come to the place in their lives where
[1:39:32] they recognize right and wrong right God
[1:39:34] doesn't hold that child guilty of
[1:39:36] anything that they did as a child
[1:39:38] because they don't know the difference
[1:39:40] of what's right and what's wrong all
[1:39:41] babies go to
[1:39:43] heaven amen me and my wife saw a story
[1:39:47] the other day of a little 2-year-old
[1:39:48] that got shot and killed by illegal
[1:39:51] aliens that were shooting and shot this
[1:39:53] little boy shot her too but she survived
[1:39:56] the mother and but killed the little boy
[1:39:58] and we looked at each said well he has
[1:40:00] no more problems amen that little boy is
[1:40:03] just fine the mo mother's suffering God
[1:40:06] help her but the little boy is just fine
[1:40:09] right amen all babies go to heaven yes
[1:40:13] amen contrary to what that movie 20
[1:40:16] years ago would tell you where All Dogs
[1:40:17] Go to Heaven all babies go to heaven I
[1:40:21] can't vouch for the dogs uh if they do I
[1:40:25] probably won't have any but uh all
[1:40:27] babies go to heaven amen because that's
[1:40:30] that's how God is a just God amen amen
[1:40:34] he doesn't hold anybody accountable to
[1:40:36] that that they don't that they don't
[1:40:38] know or don't have the capacity to be
[1:40:40] able to judge rightly by amen and a
[1:40:43] child can amen let's stand if we
[1:40:49] could
[1:40:59] praise the Lord God always provides the
[1:41:03] way for us to be able to make it God for
[1:41:06] every human everybody that's ever
[1:41:08] existed has had the opportunity the
[1:41:11] ability to be able to repent ask for
[1:41:16] forgiveness be born again God would not
[1:41:20] be a just God if there was one human
[1:41:22] ever walked the face of this planet that
[1:41:25] did not was not able to repent and and
[1:41:30] be had the availability of repentance
[1:41:34] right God would not be a just God if one
[1:41:37] single out of the however many they say
[1:41:39] billions now that's walked this dirt
[1:41:43] however many billions there's been if
[1:41:45] there's been one human God God would not
[1:41:47] be a just God if he did not make the
[1:41:50] same way for everyone to be able to yes
[1:41:53] amen amen that's my God he's a just God
[1:41:57] he's true he's right amen he does
[1:42:00] everything perfect praise the Lord he's
[1:42:04] my God
[1:42:05] Amen praise the Lord Jesus let's sing
[1:42:07] this
[1:42:09] chorus I had it here and I'm turn
[1:42:14] the praise the Lord
[1:42:17] amen born
[1:42:19] again
