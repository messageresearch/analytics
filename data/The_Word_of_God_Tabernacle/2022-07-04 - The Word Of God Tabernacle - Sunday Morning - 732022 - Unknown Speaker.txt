precious little buddy joel we went out of town this week and we went up to go watch a baseball game and ended up watching two of them but i appreciate the lord helped us to have a good time and kept us safe and kept us safe on the road and he'll bring us back home safe and i really enjoyed my time with him it meant a lot to me so yeah i think the lord watching over you never know today you go out and you know you hear about disturbances in downtown phoenix and all that stuff but you know you just can't live your life in fear amen you got to live your life in faith faith conquers fear praise the lord so i just want to give the lord glory and praise for that being with us and watching over us amen let's stand to our feet now if we could go to the scripture we're going to go back where we left off last week amen hebrews chapter 10 hebrews chapter 10 actually left off with hebrews 12. but we're going to start back at hebrews chapter 10 which is kind of the basis of where our thought came from on this message of willing versus deceived or willfully versus deceived amen so we'll try to lord willing we'll just try to pick up where we are they are willing versus disease this be part two amen but again hebrews chapter 10 uh we're going to begin reading with verse 24. amen hebrews 10 verse 24. before we read let's just bow our heads for another word pray for good precious jesus father it's privileged to be here again lord and we thank you so much for this time of fellowship around your word and for these precious people lord of light precious faith that have come and yes we've just all come together lord with uh with praise in our hearts and thanksgiving lord for what you've done for us and what you do for us every day we thank you lord for being here we thank you for you not disappointing us ever you never leave us you never forsake us you never disappoint us you never fail us you are always there lord and we're so thankful god of the testimonies that we heard are so encouraging god that you just watch over and keep us and bless us and protect us and help us and lord we just know that you're here this morning lord and they're going to continue to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think lord in meeting every one of our expectations that we come here for believing that you're going to speak to us now from your word lord you're going to show us in that word what you'd have us to see and know and lord what it is god that we have in this last day how important it is lord that we know that we are born again that your spirit lives within us that we are yours that we belong to you lord and all that comes with that father we thank you lord for this place lord for this time we thank you for the freedom that we have lord to come and worship and to live for you and to serve you and to have this service lord and to come in from out of the world and lord and to have this without without fear without worry of our door being knocked down or us being put in shackles or chains or imprisoned lord we thank you god for that freedom lord we just pray god that your hand will be upon each one of us your people your bride internationally god we rebuke every demonic spirit that we try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done for we do it for your glory and honor we thank you lord for the blessings that you give to us once again and we commit the remaining part of this into your hands speak to us from your word whatever you have purpose lord for it to be to strengthen and to bless each one of us draw us closer to you more like you this last days that we live god will give you the thanks and the praise for all that is said and done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen hebrews chapter 10 uh we'll begin reading with verse 24 amen and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as we see that day approaching for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for a judgment for for of judgment and firing indignation we shall devour the adversaries amen you can be seated if you'd like [Music] so again continuing somewhat where we left off last week amen and examining the uh thought that the lord had given me on on the difference between willfully doing something or being deceived into doing something uh or willfully versus deception we went to adam and eve last week which of course began the the beginning of it in the bible and the whole creation as we know it falling under this uh that we see in the differentiation that god placed between adam and eve uh he put that differentiation over in timothy as well to let us know that one was of the word and the other was not the one was deceived and the other could not be deceived amen we recognize adam as the word could not be deceived because the word cannot be deceived the deception was what brought the transgression amen not the not the stepping out of again like i said that that i felt was uh that was that was more of a righteous act actually even though it was a transgression or even though it was against what god had told adam he did it to go save life to preserve his wife and to bring his wife back to himself uh so he did it knowing what he was doing and then she did it because she was deceived into doing it but the deception came because of the lack of there being a in a original creation or the word herself now that propagates us to back to uh hebrews chapter 10 and hopefully lord willing takes us on a little further i go back to this scripture because i kind of felt like i went through it probably a little faster last week than maybe i should have and hope i didn't leave any lingering misunderstandings or questions or things that uh troubled you about it but maybe the lord willing would try to because the rest of this that i want to get into today really should be brought with what we preached on last week so we have to we have to bring last week into this week to be able to finish this up because all of it runs together and if we can't see how the progression of that happens and what we are in christ and what we uh mean to him what he means to us and us being in him and him being in us which he said when he was here uh if we can't grasp or understand that or have a revelation i should say of that that what that means to us in our lives and really it's pretty difficult to struggle with it's kind of like the difference between law and grace and a lot of the christian domain and christian religion today have done away with law they the the law's been done away with well it has in an aspect but then it hasn't otherwise and i don't want to get into that because that's a whole nother 6 8 10 12 15 sermons but it's kind of like that and if you can't grasp the understanding of what it is to be a child of god and to be born again and have the holy spirit living in you and through you to understand scripturally uh the incompleteness of that fulfillment then it's really hard to understand this all right so if i can't lay down the foundation well enough for us understanding the completeness of that new birth and what it really means to us and and then it becomes a struggle to us so it brings us here then to hebrews chapter 10 and of course verse 26 for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins now i went into this a little bit of detail last week and i want to again revisit that maybe a little slower maybe a little more in a teaching vein uh than kind of preaching and rushing through it last week but if we sin willfully now we know what sin is sin is unbelief sin is a transgression sin is to miss the mark and and he's saying here that if we sin willfully or we purposely uh we of our own accord we wanted to uh uh transgress that or sin willfully or turn our back on and then walk away from it willfully that willfully is purposefully knowledgeably of your own accord of your own free will you've received this now i've used that as also a an example that brother branham gave us about the holy ghost uh he said you know he talked to it with uh lee vale and and in himself and he prayed about it and and all these things that people have well the initial evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in tongues well it can't be that because that's just a simple gift of the spirit that you don't even have to be born again to have right well the most perfect evidence you can think of is love what brother brahma said there's a lot of the kind old priests and brother bran brother in jesus day that would have outdone and outshined jesus and made into one there's a lot of kind old priests and out there today they buddhists oh my if you want to go just on love alone uh the buddhist probably outshines the christians into one amen because but that's but that's all they have that's all they have to give and and they give it as an affilio and not an agape love right because it's not a love from god but uh so you think well that can't be it he thought well brother branham still i'll just stick with that for a little bit and then the lord straightened him out brother branham said the holy ghost came and straightened me out on this god told brother branham to an angel through that messenger that it was not speaking in tongues it was not love it wasn't all these other things it was the ability to be able to receive the word of the day amen to receive the word now that's a different than a drunkard sitting on the back pew and coming in and listening and walking out you say hey man did you enjoy that oh yeah that was a good sermon by the preachers and he's well where you going now well there's a bar open down here i'm going to go get drunk would he did he receive anything he heard it he may have been able to quote it he may have even been telling his buddies about it down at the bar but did he receive it see you have to receive something when you receive something it becomes a part of you it's like i've used the analogy to pick a pen i could take a pen and put it in any one of your labs and you could look at that pen but see i give you that pen but it's not yours until you actually take it and put and take ownership of it and start using it and put it in your coat pocket and take it home with you that's when you receive it to yourself just because it dumps up in your life doesn't mean you received it but this says that the people that are sinning willfully have received that knowledge they've actually received it to themselves and they've decided willfully purposefully to turn their back on it right to sin willfully after having received it now how many times does this happen after having received the knowledge of truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin no more sacrifice from sin as i said last week paul put it in the way that people claim the grace of god the grace and god of people go the grace of god the grace of god is the most outstanding thing we'll ever know in our lives the grace of god that is prominent and permanent in our lives that grace is bountiful goes beyond anything that we can imagine but there is a place where you can take that grace of god and make a disgrace out of it by willfully sinning after receiving the knowledge and walking and turning away from it there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin what happens the sacrifice is removed at that point we talked about crossing that line brother bantam told that little girl or that that young lady this may be your last chance and she didn't come up and afterwards you remember the story we talked about it brother mentions it three or four times and in the messages he talks about how he met this lady out on the street and uh she's smoking drinking and offered him a drink offered him to smoke and he said you should be ashamed of yourself he said you know parson you told me that could have been my last chance she said it was she said after that time i could now see my mother's soul fried in hell like a pancake and it wouldn't bother me you want a drink want to smoke see that's where she had gotten right she had that chance sinning willfully no more sacrifice when adam sinned when adam fell there was a sacrifice that was given god gave adam a sacrifice he took the sheepskin the sheep he killed them and threw the sheepskin in for adam and eve to be able to walk out into his presence god provided a sacrifice for him but it wasn't the ultimate sacrifice thus he still paid the penalty for his actions and all of creation has paid the penalty ever since but he did receive a sacrifice an ability to be able to come in uh uh out from the bush again a way that god could wink at that ignorance he no longer weaks in ignorance but but a time where by god's accepted way through the death of an innocent one that god accepted that person and winked at that ignorance but that sin remained that sin was still there because all the blood of the bull and the goat did was just cover that sin right that's all it did now i could take uh i could take this bottle of water and i could cover it up of course the duct cover completely had to cover my phone up you said well is there a phone there i don't know i just covered it up does anybody know if there's a phone is the phone still there a magician would come and it would be gone maybe i don't know that's the works of the devil anyway but i could cover that up but see the phone is still there even though i covered it up and you might not be able to see it it's still there and that's all there all the blood of the bulls and ghosts it was just cover that but it was still there right the the consciousness of it was still there the thought of it was still there the desire of it was still there so there had to be something come that was a greater sacrifice to annihilate that sin so that the man has no more conscience of the sin amen amen no more conscience of the sin which we'll get to in a little bit that there would be no more conscience of sin there then when there's conscience when there's that that's before the new birth because remember that's that's the dividing point a person that is born again and a person that is not born again that's the dividing point that sins willfully they said well i just do whatever i want not go to the confessional booth or uh say the hail mary's or whatever it is or or or or even in charismatic or even in the message well i just do whatever i want god will forgive me anyway i just live however won't god will forgive me anyway you're willfully purposely walking out with that attitude with that heart well that's exactly like we were talking about with um esau last week that's the exact same thing esau had in his heart that's the exact same way esau approached it again hebrews chapter 12. i'll read it again to you hebrews chapter 12 of verse 15. looking diligently lest any man fell the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who so the bible's calling esau a fornicator and profane person like esau or as esau who for one morsel of me sold his birthright so what made him a profane person that he did not value that birthright the birthright to esau meant nothing to him and that's what that's what made him a profane person for one morsel he sold of meat he sold his birthright for ye know how that afterward listen now again like we said last week afterward when he would have inherited the blessing when he would have inherited or when he would have gotten his birthright that's when he desired to repent see afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears people say well how could god if someone carefully is looking to repent with tears how could god reject that sacrifice how could god reject that because because the repentance that was offered by esau was not sincere right he offered his repentance based solely on the fact that he was sad or mad or upset about not receiving the birthright he wasn't upset about his wrongdoing he wasn't repenting of his wrongdoing he was repenting because he got caught he did what was wrong and he had to pay the price for it that's why he was repenting it's like it's like i said last week my wife says all the time people get caught they come out and you see them that oh i'm sorry oh i didn't mean to do that everybody's sorry when they get caught oh i didn't mean to kill those hundred people over the past 50 years well you know you could have stopped at the first one if you really didn't want to do it but see people are they're only repenting a lot of times only repentant when they get caught or when they have to pay the penalty when they have to pay the price so their repentance isn't based on the sorrowfulness of their actions it's based on the fact that they're having to pay the price for it now now they're sorry they're remorseful now that's where esau was that's not the kind of repentance god's looking for that's not the kind of repentance that god accepts that's why he sought it tearfully because he lost his birthright was where the tears were coming from his tears weren't coming because he loved the lord his tears were coming because he lost his birthright that's where the tears were coming from and he said those tears of sorrowfulness because he was repenting well he wasn't repenting in his heart he wasn't sorrowful for what he had done see because the scripture says afterwards when he realized that he wasn't inheriting the blessing that's when he started repenting it's the same thing for a lot of people they expect to receive something from god but where is their heart because that's that's what god accepts the words are fine the actions are fine the altar is fine but where is the heart because that's what god pays attention to if you're repenting are you repenting because you got caught are you repenting because you're afraid you're going to go to hell are you repenting because you love the lord jesus and you never want to do anything else to ever hurt him again and that's your heart's desire right not that you might not slip make a mistake but your heart's desire now this only comes to a new birth then your heart's desire is to never hurt him again now look this is what brother adam says about his about him and his wife this is a questions and answer series in uh uh of may of 1962 he said i'm not true listen now and and listen to this in comparison to esau story i am not true to my wife because i'm afraid she'll divorce me i'm true to her because i love her it's that simple amen people they might repent or they go to church they do a little penance or whatever it is just based on the fact that they that they're afraid to get caught or they got caught or whatever the situ not because they love god not because they're truly sorrowful for their actions that's then that's true repentance from the heart see brother graham says i don't do this because i'm afraid she'll divorce me i do it because i love her and there's your bottom line there's no other woman in the world but her that's the reason i'm true to her i if i've done a mistake and i thought i did something wrong come to her say me to honey honey i didn't mean to do that she'd forgive me i know she would i'd forgive her because i love her i'd forgive her she'd forgive me but i wouldn't do it for nothing in the world because i love her too much amen now you've got a relationship that's man and wife that's that's filial love that's humanity that's not even that that it is a type it's a shadow of of approaching the kind of love and affinity and affection there is between god and man or between god and you let's make it personal between god and you this is approaching that but this is just a man and a woman in our humanity in our filial love if feeling of love will make a man or woman act that way towards one another what do you think it is then with the love of god amen the agape unconditional love of god yes wow powerful but that's how much he loves you but that is also how much we should love him and if we love him like that then we conduct our lives that way we live our lives with that in that capacity because that's where our love is amen a lot of times it's desires in life that drive people most people people most of the time they do what they want to do no matter what they say oh i meant to or i should have or i going to or most people are going to do whatever they want to do and that comes to christianity that comes to come at a church that comes to living their lives right that comes to everything most people are just going to do whatever they want to do and that's usually what it boils down to but but a true born-again christian is not concerned about what they want they're concerned about what he wants yes they're not concerned about pleasing themselves they're concerned about pleasing the lord and and again just in a small now he doesn't put it in here i'm going to finish this quote in a minute but to put it in a natural perspective again uh i lived my life and i and i i lived it in a way as a as a young man and going to school and everything i did and driving around and the places i went and the things i did and and the friends i kept and all that i did as a young man and and and my concern was to numero uno it was me that was my concern then i met my wife who became my wife then i met sonia and things changed slowly now it didn't all happen at once the desires of my life became what's going to make her happy the desires of my life became how can i fulfill or make her life better amen if you've been married you know what i'm talking about your whole desire is now falling in that capacity towards that person now again that's just a natural effect of of a greater stronger power of god pulling us to him but my desire then and as we got married and got older and had kids our desires became what can i do to make her happy i mean friend i i'll just be honest with you i i was a mama's boy i was a spoiled rotten brat although i would fight my own my sister tooth and nail when she called me that i was i was youngest i was eight years difference i was full of breath i i i could walk in the door and shed every piece of clothes and walk into the shower my mother would pick every piece up she wouldn't tell me to do it i didn't do that but i could she would have picked every i i i i used uh a i used a towel throw it on the floor and just my room was a mess and all those things is just a mess i didn't even learn how to toast bread i probably could boil water but i couldn't boil an egg because i didn't know how long to boil it for i bowl an egg you'd probably take it down the bowling alley here use it that's because i didn't know any honestly i was spoiled i didn't know anything i really still don't hardly but uh but that's her fault now but but as i got as we got married i i no longer left my clothes thrown out all over the place because i knew what it because i knew that did make her happy she's not my maid she's not my footstool she's my mate she's my wife i love her and then picking up my junk is going to make her health happier picking up my clothes and that's going to make her happier then that's what i'm going to do and she probably knows it as much as anybody i've changed drastically from the time i met her to the time we got married and even after that because you learn you learn and see it became more about her than it did about me before i met her it was all about me after i met her the more and more i got to know her the more and more i wanted to be with him the more and more i loved her the more and more i wanted her to be happy the more my life changed and the same thing happens as a christian in a greater way of course because you realize who where your love really lies and it's to the lord you don't want to do anything to ever hurt him no you don't come to church or pay your tithes or have your prayer time or read your bible you don't do all those things just because you're trying to dodge hell you do it because you love the lord you don't live the life you live because it it would look bad if you did if you did whatever you wanted to do or wherever you wanted to wear what would people say about me who cares i care about what he says about him then it becomes about what can i do to make him happy what can i do to please him how can i live my life that's going to be pleasing to him and everything changes see then there's no then there's no sin willfully there's no willful sinning thus there's the sacrifice that continually lays there so that when a mistake does happen when you do fall in a hole or get in a trap make a mistake say something humanity or emotions or something there's a place of repentance there's a sacrifice there's blood that's on that mercy seat and god hears that prayer it answers and there's it and and even in our human flesh even our human abilities is completely wiped away annihilated as if it would never happen esau didn't have that unfortunately and i hate to say this but a lot of people today don't have that their desire is not because they love the lord now look he said i wouldn't do that for nothing because i love her too much it isn't because i didn't think she would forgive me it's the idea that i love her so much in the first place as long as i love her like that now now listen he's gonna break this down from his relationship to his wife to our relationship with the lord so listen closely as long as i love her like that i'll never do it and if she loves me that way she's supposed to she won't either and and you love the lord with all your heart amen let that really take its hold for us today saints if you really love the lord with all your heart i'm going to ask you to raise your hand but you know you love the lord with all your heart amen you don't have to worry about these things if you make a mistake you don't sin willfully you've just done something wrong you've slipped back a little true you was up there in fellowship and you dropped back down here into this mess again a slip-up mistake now we've talked about this several times but i want to go over to first john again first john chapter 3 one of my favorite chapters in the scripture first john chapter 3 we'll begin with verse 1. amen behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet manifest or appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that had this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law now where does that come from amen understanding the differentiation between body spirit soul remember your body your spirit is human flesh can be corrupted the soul if you're born again if you're born again your soul is the resident of god god's seed the word of god god himself present in your soul that is what your soul is it is god that sees if god is in there that's the word it's the same as it would have been or was in the garden of eden with adam adam was the word he could not transgress he could not be deceived because he was the word if that who created him god himself is in you by new birth then the same thing exists in you now not talking about your body not talking about your spirit we're not excusing sin and wrong doing amen so we get that straight there is no excusing of sin or wrongdoing or mistakes there's no excusing it but in your soul there is no place if god is in there to be deceived because it's the word and the word cannot be deceived yes there's no place to transgress because it's the word amen it's the pure holiness of the word now the body spirit can be still flesh spirit can be but that soul which is god's property which god is concerned about the most that soul is born again it's of god then it cannot cannot be deceived can't no more no more than god can be deceived because that's who's living in you that's who you really are to begin with we spoke on this we've had a three or four part series on that who am i who am i who are you understanding that will help you understand what this is saying to us whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested listen now he jesus was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin or as i've said before i don't mean to change the word but it could read he was manifested to take away our sins because he was had no sin that's the only way he could take away our sin because he had no sin that's why no other person revelation chapter 5 can come forth nobody else could come forth and take that book but jesus christ because everybody was born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lives everybody has sinned and come short of the glory of god except for jesus christ himself that perfect sacrifice because he had no sin he could take my sin and become sin himself and actually go to hell for me hang on a cross and go to hell for me praise the lord why would he do that except for the purpose that you would be sinless praise god amen to take away your mistake to take away your sin to annihilate the original sin in the garden of eden praise the lord amen that that sin would be annihilated by his own precious blood that he would take that on himself and become that sin so you could become the very righteousness of god remember what that righteousness is it is a person in their own in their rightful place and there ought to be condition and that's spiritually spiritually in the place that you ought to be in the mind of god where god saw you before the foundation of the world that's where you are now that's your awful that's your rightful position amen because that's god's position in your mind and excuse me in his mind that's where we were his thoughts his attributes he was manifested to take away our sin because there was no sin in him amen whosoever abideth in him abideth in him sinneth not sinneth not whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither known him little children that no man deceive you he that doth doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous god is righteous god is the only righteous one so if god is the only righteous one and that god lives in you that is the only thing that puts you in the position that you should be in his mind before the world began in that righteousness of god a righteous person you see i'm not righteous i'm not looking at your flesh we're not talking about your spirit we're talking about the soul of man that god is taking up resident that you're born again you become a new creature all things are changed when you become a new creation he that doth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous so that that's the only thing that makes us righteous he that committeth sin list this now he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil what was the works of the devil the works of the devil was to unbelieve to sin from the beginning what was it that the devil did his very heart according to the scripture his very heart called him to transgress god's word why because he wasn't the word right he could transgress because he wasn't the word and his whole point was to cause you to be deceived to cause the world humanity to be deceived so that this world would fall in sin just like he wanted to but where is this sin from it's from his heart he desired it but what does he do to a child of god all he could do remember what was he given brother brahm said god gave the choice you want the heart of the mind he took the mind so where is that deception at it's up here it's in your body it's in your spirit that he deceives you with that's the work of the enemy that's why it says if you sin if you commit sin if you live in sin it's of the devil right that's why we don't live in sin amen because why whosoever is born of god does not ninth verse whosoever is born of god does not commit sin now the i don't know if you have scofield but in my scofield note that commit is practice sin whosoever is born of god does not practice sin but i want you to notice because to me it's not the practicing of sin it's the heart that he's talking about it's the soul it's not the practice of sin the practice of sin is something that you do with your hands your body your mind your spirit that's the practice of sin i'm not talking about the practice of sin i'm talking about being a sin being your heart your soul not being transformed changed born again see if it hasn't been born again then you still live in sin like you were and your very desires are to sin your desire you want to you desire to your whole life is well i'll i'll just do this god offer and people live as christians like that right oh well god god will just forgive me i'll just go ahead and do this anyway i'll just you know god god forgive me it'll be okay you know the grace of god is powerful yes it is but you don't take it and make a disgrace out of it or there remaineth no more sacrifice for your sin amen listen that's the scripture whosoever is born of god it's not a practice of sin now look at the rest of the scripture and i can use the scripture to refute scofield's note here for his seed remaineth in him and he can not sin now that has nothing to do with a practice over here he says practice that's not what he's talking about no he does not sin because he cannot sin how can you not sin because your heart has changed your your soul is changed you're a different person you're a new creation you can your soul can no more sin from the desires of your heart than god himself because god is the one that's the resident of your soul right no wonder you cannot sin where's that sin and so uh i i'm perfectly sinless in your body in your flesh and your spirit we make mistakes all the time that's why brother brown put a cross in his car brother you remember the story brother green told he's sitting there with brother branham and this beautiful nice looking mexican lady come walking across the street and he just followed her all the way across he said now brother green remember now that's that's what we need to guard ourselves of something to that effect and he put that cross in his car and he sees things like that he look at the cross right amen because he was a blessing he was a blood man he was a human male subject to light passions just just as it says it's uh the old prophet was elijah was james 5 tells us elijah was a man subject to like passion well so was uh so was brother brown so in that in that spirit you make mistakes your emotions get the best of you sometimes or you get caught in a trap or make a mistake those things happen friend to all of us but it happens in our body our spirit that's why that blood is there on the mercy seat right make intercession on our behalf but the soul of man cannot sin you are born of god yes that born of god identifies to us what is not sin and that's your soul you don't get reborn in your flesh i mean nicodemus thought that i entered into my mother's womb the second time he had no revelation of what jesus was trying to tell him not in your flesh you're not born again in the flesh we didn't sing those songs born again in your spirit no it's your soul that gets born again that seed of god that remains in there that's god himself when that seed comes to life it's god it's no more it's no more the devil it's god that lives in there and you cannot sin because you're born of god born of god how by a new birth your soul has been changed you're a new creature in christ yes you're no longer the man or woman you're no longer the person that you were amen look at this then jesus then jesus came and called 1964. but on this when we really place our hands upon our sacrifice now look this is the differentiation between what we're talking about with esau and and probably a lot of people today the differentiation you really place your hands upon your sacrifice jesus and feel in your heart that you are guilty and you know that you're doing wrong amen there's the difference the blood of that sacrifice the life that was in the blood was god himself the light that was in the blood was god himself so he comes back upon you the holy spirit you become a son of god then with no more conscience of sin praise god we'll get to that in just a second no more conscience of sin we wanted to lay down the foundation the of the sinlessness of a child of god of a born-again child of god you're sinless what's sinless your soul who you really are this guy makes mistakes all the time that's why the blood's still there that's that's why i in my humble opinion i think some ministers get it off a little bit and they want to take the blood off the mercy seat and there's no need for the blood anymore because they they they don't see the differentiation to understand that your soul has been redeemed and god lives in there and you are the word in your soul but your body and your spirit are still corruptable again doesn't excuse sin does not excuse anything that we may do wrong or think wrong doesn't but you're still human and that humanity part of you we still need that blood yes amen we still need that forgiveness we still need that perpetuation that perpetuation that takes our place amen we still need that the soul has been redeemed it's sealed when the bible says he's sealed unto your destination you're sealed there's there's nothing to get nothing else can get in there nothing else can come out you are sealed until your destination that's it when brother adam talks about a refilling of the holy ghost he's not talking about your soul a refilling is not in the soul when you're born again you're sealed that's it you don't need anything else in there nothing more nothing less a refeeling is an anointing it's an anointing that falls on your flesh on your spirit that refilling of that anointing we can we get one new birth but many real feelings many anointings many times god comes and falls on us in our services or at home or wherever we are god falls on us and we feel his presence well that's what it means amen that's a refilling that's god's anointing falling on you the soul is sealed it's done it's finished you don't need any more of god in your soul the seed of god that was born came forth as god in your soul that's it spinach praise the lord so the armenians the calvinists i believe it's a calvinist believed in the eternal salvation but then they believed in it the way that you could well i'm going wherever i'm going so i just act to live however i want you you can't do that and the armenians will scare everybody to death and say well now if you make one wrong move you're going straight to hell you got to find a balance like we preached that's where scripture meets scripture you've got to find a balance to understand yes there is a truth to eternal security but that's after you've received the holy ghost and been born again and that is settled but now we still struggle with this body so you got the armenians now they got truth to that yes we need to live our lives as holy and righteous as we can according to god's word and not do anything that would be displeasing to him amen that's what that that so they both have a truth but they got to draw it out to where it it works scripturally to fit for our lives amen there is a eternal security but it's that soul look now let me finish this the blood of that sacrifice the life that was in that blood was god himself he came back upon you in the form of the holy spirit you become a son of god then we have no more conscience again we'll get to that no more conscience of sin he that's born of god listen now born of god we just read the seed of god is in you you're born of god the new birth the holy spirit all the explicitives adjectives we've been describing he that is born of god does not commit sin praise the lord he can't sin why he can't transgress because that's god in there right that's the word in there remember he couples it just like john did here born of god the new birth not talking about your flesh spirit the new birth see born of god does not commit sin he can't sin because the seed of god is in him he cannot sin just like adam in the garden of eden praise the lord amen oh think of it friend he has no more desire of sin at all no more desire of sin at all so long as you're desiring sin listen now so long as you're desiring to sin you're guilty of it right amen but when you have no more desire if you do anything wrong then you don't do it willfully hebrews 6 if we send will after receiving the knowledge of the truth remains no more sacrifice for sin sin willfully so if you continually want to sin willfully there's something wrong with your experience yes something wrong with your experiences there's not a oh well it's okay it'll be okay god forgives us god forgives sin god will uh god will wipe it away god will do away with it the grace of god will take will take effect over that but then but then they make it but then making a disgrace out of it out of god that's making it this way then it becomes no more sacrifice for sin let's go over to back to hebrews chapter 10 again we'll close here in just a few minutes hebrews chapter 10 again let's go to the first verse this time see how uh paul put these in the same chapter here how they were codified into the same chapter hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come just a shadow now and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect we already mentioned we talked about that it was just a covering just covered their sin the sin was still there it just covered it see so that no sacrifice is coming irregardless of god instituting this sacrifice himself god is the one that brought and instituted these sacrifices he did it first in the garden of eden and he came with moat to moses with the law and the paschal lamb and thereafter how this sacrifice would be that would be acceptable to god but those sacrifices that they brought year after year after year even though it was acceptable by god did not make the worshiper perfect right they still had that conscience of sin second verse for then would they have would for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have no more conscience of sins no more conscious look at this the worshiper which would be us we are the worshipers we are his children we are the ones that come offering spiritual sacrifices to god as the worshipper once purged cleansed eradicated done away with every sin and wrongdoing by the burning out of the holy ghost and fire of the nature that you were born with annihilating that holy ghost that that holy ghost and fire that that comes and burns that out annihilates every sin that could ever be held against you does away with it purge no more a part of it you have nothing to do with sin anymore it's it's done out of your life by the holy spirit that god sends that annihilates that which gave the human the chance because in the beginning we didn't have a chance because it wasn't our fault that adam and eve fell wasn't our fault they're our parents though or our great great great whatever back they're our parents though so when humanity fell because of adam and even the guard of eden then we came as fallen beings but it wasn't our fault so god made a way god made an exception for us to be able to have our sins done away if we desired and we followed with his word god would annihilate those sin the purging of that sin the purging of the worshippers sin brought god into the present view of righteousness so as he is righteous we are righteous because he's the one who made us righteous praise the lord have now no more conscience of sin it's not a conchable thing look at what the greek says on those on this word conscience i was just gonna read it but uh but i felt i wanted to print it because the more i read it the more it become real to me so i'll read it to you it's the greek on the word conscience here where it says he has no more conscience of sin and i think well what does that mean what is my conscience you know people say things ways on their conscience or my conscience would tell me not to do something it's a person's uh innermost thought process of conscience from the heart but look at what the conscience says now in the greek the definition here conscious the soul that's the first thing to think the soul as distinguishing between what is morally good and bad understand the conscience is the soul distinguishing between what is morally good and bad prompting to do the former which is good and shunned the ladder which is bad commending one which is the good and condemning the other by the conscience but now recognize the scripture says we have no more conscience of sin where the soul weighs morally what's good and bad well why would we have no more conscience of sin if we're children of god to weigh out what is morally good and bad because in your soul you're a new creature right there there is no weighing of good and bad there's only the word there's only the good there is only god you don't way to do something bad you just don't do the bad right there's no more weighing of that conscience because there's nothing to weigh you understand because to a child of god to that has been born again the conscience of the sin has been annihilated because all that is there is god in the word amen perfect holiness righteousness godliness that's the only thing that's there there is no weighing of the bad there is no bad now your humanity now your your brain and what you've been raised to know or believe what is morally good or bad is still there but the conscience of the soul is gone there there's there's there's no more way the sin question has been answered there is no more guilt right there is no more unrighteousness there is no more ungodliness it's all god in his word you as who you really are your soul so there's no more conscience of sin because there's nothing in you to want to sin to do sin to commit sin no more to say there can't be a deception because it's the word it's god well there can't be a conscience of sin where there's god because all that god is is good there is no morally bad there's nothing to weigh understand there's nothing there to weigh back and forth in your soul why because you've been born again all that's in there is this yeah it's just the word yes there's no bad it's just god it's just the word so you don't worry about that because you've been born again yes you're a new creature in christ jesus now can we see can we see and understand the willfully versus the deceptively can we weigh and understand the difference between being born again and a person that is born again and someone that is not right the desire to sin the willfulness of sin the walking out into sin purposefully the soul desiring to continue to live in sin to continue to live the ways of the world and the things that are wrong do we see and understand how those things get weighed and weighed in god's mind and who we are in god if we are a child of god if god lives in us and our very soul is god himself we're born of god there cannot be any more sin in there there cannot be any more conscience or weighing of what is morally good and bad because it's only god there is no bad of god it's only him praise the lord there's no more conscience of sin the worshipers been purged have no more conscience no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices third verse now there is a remembrance again they remembered it now there's a remembrance again made of sin every year their desires weren't changed they lived in the same capacity that they were born in sin shape iniquity called the world speaking lies for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice and offering doubt what is not but a body has thou prepared me and burn offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure no pleasure and there is no pleasure of sin to a child of god there's pleasure of sin to the world but there is no pleasure of sin to a child of god because he has no more conscience of sin right he's born again amen once just like ephesians 2 said i was going to read it but we'll skip over that once ephesians said once we were dead in our sins now we're dead to sin praise god because of the righteousness of jesus christ one more the god who is rich in mercy 1965 he that's born of god does not commit sin the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin no more desire to sin because remember there's no way your soul's not weighing good and bad anymore there's no there's not even a conscience no desire for sin no more conscience no more desire to sin the sin question is over you become a part of god in christ and christ has died to redeem you praise the lord now if you're born again that's who god has made you the same question is over the difference of people struggling back and forth of willfully i'm a child of god have i gone too far i've made that mistake have i done this willfully or by deception well you can make mistakes in your flesh sin sakes but if you're born to god that's god god makes no mistakes god has no sin you're born of him you belong to him that's who we are in him and people wonder oh did i and and say no try to get you to believe that oh well all these things i i did it because i wanted to why you you might have walked into something wide-eyed but that didn't mean you had the desire for it there's a difference there's a difference in saying well you know i made this mistake and you know i knew what i was doing and that doesn't that doesn't condone it seems that does not make it right especially even in the ministry that does not make it right there's there's penalties that still come with that you will reap what you sow and if you sow the bad you're going to reap that amen because that's where it comes from but if you're born again you're a child of god amen you're a part of god you belong to him he that is born of god can not sin yes amen no more conscience of sin yes praise the lord let's stand if we could praise the lord thank god he has made the way amen let's sing his little song amen i'm a new creation praise the lord aren't you glad of that it's a new creation because fortunately the soul inside is what dictates to the spirit and then the spirit dictates to the body so the soul bringing the flesh of the subjection causes the flesh to fall in line with the word which is what the soul is yes the word amen amen so the flesh and the spirit come in line to the word yes amen and listen this now hallelujah [Music] [Music] thank god he justified me and [Music] i'm a new creation [Music] [Applause]

precious praise the lord jesus you're a different person you're a new being you're a new creature god has made you thus praise the lord jesus amen i'm so thankful there is a difference yes don't get caught up in the difference amen just thank god that he has made you who you were to be before the foundation of the world a child of god amen the spirit of god living in you you being thank you jesus don't let the devil defeat you don't let him deceive you don't let it make you think you're any less than who god says you are yes amen praise the lord god bless you i pray something was said to bless
