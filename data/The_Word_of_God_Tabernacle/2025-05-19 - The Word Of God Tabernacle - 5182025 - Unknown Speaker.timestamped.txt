[35:53] I guess even my family uh this week that
[35:56] the church that I kind of um well I
[36:00] don't know if you say grew up in but
[36:02] kind of
[36:04] uh well my my kids grew up in but the uh
[36:09] I started ministering in and all uh
[36:12] closed down.
[36:14] uh the pastor I guess he's he's in his
[36:16] 80s now. So, uh he's had some physical
[36:19] struggles and uh building they had was
[36:22] kind of an older building and said it
[36:23] was a little more difficult to keep up
[36:25] with and take care of and uh so uh he
[36:29] just he just stopped the work and
[36:31] actually sold the building. Uh so the
[36:34] place that we were at that our children
[36:36] were dedicated and that we received the
[36:38] Holy Ghost were baptized and uh so many
[36:41] other events had my mom and dad both my
[36:43] mom and dad's memorial service there and
[36:45] so many other things happened in that
[36:47] building and it's kind of home to us. So
[36:50] it's uh spiritual home. So it's kind of

[39:00] um left them 20 miles away and she told
[39:05] them you know we're going to I'm going
[39:07] to tell the embassy on you. So he
[39:10] refunded their money but still left them
[39:12] there. So just to be careful in Mexico
[39:16] that they're treating Americans
[39:21] That's not
[39:24] good. Remember that. Thankful they're
[39:27] okay. Yeah. She said they made it back
[39:30] safely, but 20 miles long.
[39:34] Yeah. Anyone
[39:39] else request
[39:50] Lord Jesus, it's an
[39:53] honor to be in your house of worship,
[39:56] your house of prayer, your house where
[39:59] your word is preached and truth and and
[40:05] revealed message has come and one little
[40:10] assembly is standing for you. Thank you,
[40:12] Father.
[40:14] Lord, we're all in a
[40:17] race. I remember when I ran track, oh,
[40:21] many, many years ago. And Lord, the
[40:25] hardest part of the race was the last
[40:28] 10, 15 yards. Yes. And Lord, that's
[40:31] where we stand right now.
[40:33] us. The devil's fighting us harder than
[40:36] ever before, but you have equipped us
[40:39] with the whole armor of
[40:41] God. Lord, one of these days, the church
[40:45] doors will be closed. The Bibles will be
[40:49] stacked. my mind on. Yes, sir. The song
[40:51] books will be left in the seats and the
[40:54] ones that are struggling and and failing
[40:57] to obey your word, you won't have to
[41:00] worry about coming to church, it's over.
[41:02] Yes. You won't have to worry about
[41:04] paying your tithe. It's over. My You
[41:07] won't have to worry about praying. It's
[41:10] over. Lord Jesus, the gospel as we turn
[41:13] back to the Jews, help us, Lord, and
[41:15] help us to catch the vision right now
[41:18] with all that we're battling with. We
[41:22] have a great and mighty conqueror that's
[41:25] in us that's fighting our battles for
[41:27] us. Hallelujah. That's our advocate.
[41:30] That's our strength. That's our rock in
[41:33] our weary land. That's our our absolute.
[41:37] That's our everything. And when the
[41:40] gospel returns back to the Jews, the
[41:44] people that miss the rapture are going
[41:47] to be totally left on their own. They
[41:50] won't have the Holy Spirit to help them.
[41:53] And you make excuses. God, an OC and I
[41:58] knows what we're doing. Amen. No one
[42:02] knows what excuses we are presenting to
[42:05] him when we fail to obey his word. It's
[42:09] like James says, "He that keepeth the
[42:11] whole law and yet offendeth in one
[42:14] point, he is guilty of all." Yes. Amen.
[42:17] Oh Lord, it's time to repent or perish.
[42:20] It's time to get right with God. Lord
[42:22] Jesus, all the signs are lining up.
[42:25] Prophecies are being
[42:28] fulfilled. There's more earthquakes than
[42:30] I've ever seen at any time at this time.
[42:34] There's volcanoes erupting all over the
[42:37] world. Amen. There's fearful sights that
[42:40] people are reporting and your prophets
[42:43] taught us those are investigating
[42:45] judgment angels and before your judgment
[42:49] hits this earth. You warn the people
[42:52] what it is it going to take for people
[42:55] to wake up. Amen. I believe I love them
[42:57] all, Father. I believe they're bride.
[43:00] But some need to get that oil. Yes,
[43:03] Lord. besides trimming their lambs. They
[43:05] got to seek you for the baptism of the
[43:08] Holy Ghost and have that desire to put
[43:11] you first, Father. And Lord, our
[43:14] precious brother uh Newton and his wife
[43:17] are going on a trip, a long trip. Oh,
[43:20] bless him. Protect them. Our brother
[43:23] Micah as well, Father. Oh, may they have
[43:27] a good trip. May you lead him and guide
[43:29] him in all things. May you keep him in
[43:33] the safety of your hands, Father. And
[43:37] Lord,
[43:38] oh, I thank you, Lord, for my cousin
[43:41] that that was safely brought back to her
[43:45] hotel after a a terrible incident. Lord,
[43:50] she claims to be a Christian. I believe
[43:52] that. I believe she trusted in you,
[43:55] Father. And Lord, we want to give you
[43:58] praise, honor, and glory. Amen. For it's
[44:01] unlimited what God would do if we stayed
[44:04] together in unity. It's not by numbers.
[44:08] It's not by uh filled capacities of any
[44:12] churches. It's our hearts uh yielded and
[44:16] united together. It's unlimited what God
[44:19] would do. Amen. When we stayed together.
[44:23] Yes. Oh, bless our pastor Father who
[44:25] brings forth your word. Faith cometh by
[44:28] hearing and hearing of the word of God.
[44:31] Thank you, Lord. For judgment must begin
[44:33] at the house of God. That's what we're
[44:35] here for, Lord. We want to just be ready
[44:39] that much more. Your word's the only
[44:41] thing that can do that for us. Granted,
[44:43] God, granted, Father, where we give you
[44:45] praise, honor, and glory. We love you
[44:48] with all our hearts, and we love one
[44:50] another. Amen. In your name we pray.
[44:52] Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[44:55] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless
[44:58] you. You can be seated if you'd
[44:59] [Music]
[45:02] like. Amen. Appreciate everyone's
[45:04] prayers.
[45:06] Um, as you probably can still tell, my
[45:09] voice still isn't uh up to what it
[45:12] should be. Uh, but the devil's not going
[45:16] to win. So,
[45:19] we're going to have church anyway, and
[45:21] we're going to worship the Lord and
[45:23] praise the Lord and give him all the
[45:24] glory because is more than worthy. Amen.
[45:27] I believe healing has already taken
[45:30] place. You know, just sometimes you have
[45:32] the leftover residuals or whatever of
[45:35] the feeling and my throat's still not
[45:37] back. My voice isn't back to what it
[45:39] should be. But, uh, by God's grace, all
[45:41] is well. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, song
[45:44] number seven, going to sing this, song
[45:47] number seven. Have it on the screen
[45:49] here. Amen. When the re redeemed are
[45:52] gathering
[45:54] in praise the Lord Jesus.

[46:04] blessed home on high when the
[46:07] redeemed are gathering
[46:10] in. I will raise the heavenly up in that
[46:15] city in the sky. When the

[47:30] with their voices clear and strong. When
[47:33] the
[47:35] redeemed are gathering
[47:38] in, then the angels all will listen. For
[47:42] they cannot join that song. When the
[47:46] redeemed are gathering

[52:56] um grounds manager was kind of worried
[52:59] that might

[53:04] they found that he has two
[53:07] masses
[53:11] by further test to see how bad.
[53:20] Amen. Yes. What was his name? His name

[53:37] Yes. Praise the Lord. Amen. Yes, he
[53:40] does. Glory to God.
[53:43] Amen. Anyone else?
[53:48] This might be a simple testimony.
[53:53] Sunday and um that Saturday, Sunday
[53:58] morning, I had an attack my knee, my
[54:03] neuropathy, almost anything, my back and
[54:07] and I would had to be able to make it.
[54:11] And I prayed this morning, Lord, I
[54:13] wouldn't go to church. That's my place.
[54:15] Yes. That's where God wants us to be in
[54:18] our place. Amen. Not today. Amen. Praise
[54:22] the Lord Jesus. Wonderful. Amen. That is
[54:25] not a small testimony. Amen. And I felt
[54:29] fine. Honestly, I never felt bad all the
[54:32] whole time. It just that congestion and
[54:35] coughing. I just it just couldn't
[54:37] control it. It was wearing me out and
[54:39] tiring me out and wearing my voice out
[54:41] of course and throat and having to sing
[54:44] and preach is uh was kind of a little
[54:47] bit too much of a mountain for me to
[54:49] climb last Sunday. So, I appreciate
[54:51] everyone uh allowing the time off last
[54:55] week. So, feel better. Voice isn't 100%
[54:58] back, but uh by God's grace, all is
[55:01] well. And unfortunately, a devil jumped
[55:03] on my wife, too. So, she's been uh
[55:06] coughing, too. But, uh God bless her.
[55:09] It's just weird because you wake up and
[55:11] it's it's a lot of congestion, a lot of
[55:14] coughing. I mean, some of you may have
[55:15] gotten I had this. I don't know because
[55:17] some of you been out and coughing and
[55:19] stuff and then in the afternoon during
[55:21] the day usually it's mostly fine really
[55:25] cough here and there or something. Uh
[55:27] but then then when you get ready to go
[55:28] to bed it starts all over again and it's
[55:31] hard to sleep and stuff. So that's kind
[55:33] of where she's at now. But she's doing a
[55:35] lot better. But uh just pray for her too
[55:38] if you would that not that she's not
[55:40] already healed but that that thing will
[55:42] go away in a hurry because you start
[55:44] getting on airplanes coughing. don't
[55:46] like that.
[55:47] So, they don't like coughing on flames
[55:50] very much, even if it is just allergies
[55:52] or something. Uh, but by God's grace,
[55:54] all is well. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[55:56] Lord. Let's stand to our feet then.
[55:58] Amen. And we'll go right back to try to
[56:00] where we left off then before Mother's
[56:02] Day again. Uh, hate I miss Mother's Day,
[56:06] but I hope y'all had a blessed and
[56:08] wonderful Mother's Day. Those mothers
[56:11] and Amen. Maybe even Alice had a
[56:14] wonderful day.
[56:15] Amen. Potentially future mother. Uh
[56:19] but anyway, we'll pick up Romans chapter
[56:22] 8. We're going to go to Romans chapter 8
[56:24] and read a few verses there. We've been
[56:26] reading with this manifested sons of
[56:29] God. Couple more parts here. Um this
[56:33] will be manifested sons of God part 14.
[56:36] Uh part four, excuse me. Adoption part
[56:38] 15, manifested sons of God part four.
[56:42] Amen. Hopefully today we'll try to a few
[56:44] minutes of uh uh who we are, our place,
[56:47] our position, what what belongs to us,
[56:50] what God's given us. Amen. What we have
[56:52] for this. So, Romans 18 uh 8 uh verse
[56:56] 19, we'll start reading, but before we
[56:58] do, can we just bow our heads for a word
[57:00] of prayer? Lord Jesus, again, we're very
[57:03] thankful and grateful, Lord, of your
[57:05] blessings and all that you've given and
[57:06] done for us. Lord, we realize in
[57:08] ourselves we are nothing, Father, but
[57:10] just trusting in you, God, the frailties
[57:13] of our body. so many
[57:15] times comes forward, Lord, and uh shows
[57:18] itself, Father, in the frailties of our
[57:21] humanity and the sicknesses and things
[57:23] that go around and allergies and
[57:25] whatever, God. And these bodies just
[57:27] seem subject to so much of that. But
[57:29] greater is he that's in us than he
[57:31] that's in the world. And we thank you,
[57:33] Father, for healing. We thank you for
[57:35] blessings. We thank you for giving us
[57:36] the strength, the ability, Lord, to be
[57:39] able to stand for you, God, and to come
[57:42] to this place and to minister and to
[57:44] listen and to sing and to worship. And
[57:46] God, we're so thankful again, thankful
[57:48] for this place, Lord, you've given us
[57:50] and trust you to continue to bless it,
[57:52] Lord, as we commit it to you. Take
[57:54] complete control of the remaining part
[57:56] of this service, Lord, and speak through
[57:58] these lips, Lord, toward you to have us
[58:00] to hear, God. I may anoint every ear to
[58:02] receive, to hear what you have to speak
[58:05] to us today. We're a needy people. We're
[58:07] looking forward to that word to be
[58:09] revealed to us again, shown to us and
[58:12] become ownership in our lives, Lord. It
[58:15] becomes a reality to us. Faith comes
[58:17] from it. Faith is built from it, Lord.
[58:20] And we can stand upon that word and
[58:22] claim what is ours for this day. God
[58:25] blesses as we commit it to you now in
[58:28] the remaining part of this service. your
[58:30] blessings upon it. In the name of the
[58:31] Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[58:35] Amen. Romans chapter 8 verse
[58:39] 19. For the earnest expectation of the
[58:42] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[58:44] of the sons of God. For the creature was
[58:47] made subject to vanity, not willingly,
[58:49] but by reason of him who has subjected
[58:51] the same in hope. because the creature
[58:54] itself also shall be delivered from the
[58:56] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[58:59] liberty of the children of God. For we
[59:02] know that the whole creation groanth and
[59:05] travaleth in pain together until now.
[59:09] And not only they, but ourselves also,
[59:12] which have the first fruits of the
[59:14] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[59:17] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[59:21] it the redemption of our bodies. You can
[59:24] be seated if you'd
[59:26] like. Amen. Now, we went through the
[59:30] last uh the last service that we
[59:32] had. Actually, the last couple of
[59:35] services that we had through creation
[59:37] and through the uh creation of man,
[59:40] through the creation of humanity, uh
[59:43] through the creation of animal life,
[59:44] botney life, and through the possession
[59:47] of what God gave to man, what man's
[59:50] position was to be on the earth. God
[59:52] told him to multiply, replenish, have
[59:55] dominion over the over the fish of the
[59:57] seas, and over the fowl of the air, and
[59:59] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:00:01] upon the earth. God gave dominion. Amen.
[1:00:04] We went to recognize that uh we believe
[1:00:07] that of course that the creation of
[1:00:09] human was uh that that what God put in
[1:00:12] the botney life for it to re reproduce.
[1:00:15] What God put in the animal life to
[1:00:17] reproduce. Amen. Uh he gave botney life
[1:00:20] just a seed. He gave animal life a
[1:00:22] spirit. But he gave in the man put into
[1:00:24] man and spoke and and breathed into man
[1:00:28] uh so that man became a living soul.
[1:00:31] Amen. and found it uh in that that the
[1:00:34] the man itself can actually act worse
[1:00:37] than an animal. Uh actually by doing the
[1:00:41] same thing as an anim animalistic
[1:00:42] nature, having a soul and a nature and
[1:00:45] an and a and a an understanding of right
[1:00:48] and wrong and what it should and
[1:00:49] shouldn't do actually makes the the the
[1:00:52] transa the transaction the the uh
[1:00:54] transgression worse. Amen. knowing right
[1:00:58] and doing it makes it worse than doing
[1:01:00] it when you don't know. Amen. If you if
[1:01:03] you don't know, if there's ignorance and
[1:01:05] you don't know, then God I believe God
[1:01:08] holds into a different place of someone
[1:01:11] that does know better and still does it.
[1:01:13] And that's what we know as of iniquity.
[1:01:16] Knowing you should do something and not
[1:01:18] do it or doing something you know you
[1:01:19] shouldn't do uh is iniquity. Well, that
[1:01:22] doesn't fall in the category of botney
[1:01:24] life. That doesn't fall in the category
[1:01:26] of animal life. That falls in the
[1:01:27] category of human life. Man with a soul
[1:01:30] that knows right and wrong and knows
[1:01:31] what to do and not do. Uh we know that
[1:01:34] Adam was given the the book of life. He
[1:01:36] was given the ability to to speak and to
[1:01:39] name and to say and uh he could control
[1:01:42] nature and he could name the he named
[1:01:44] the animals and uh uh but in his hand
[1:01:47] was the the book of life to be able to
[1:01:49] create or to speak uh lives that were to
[1:01:54] come into existence through the lamb's
[1:01:56] book of life that was names written on
[1:01:58] before the foundation of the world.
[1:02:00] Amen. Each one was to come for forth in
[1:02:02] its decreed time and season was to be
[1:02:05] spoken. It was not supposed to be in
[1:02:07] God's perfect original will to be
[1:02:10] procreation. Man was not supposed to
[1:02:12] come forth in procreation. So humans as
[1:02:16] uh uh humans fell and procreation became
[1:02:20] the way of man uh control uh being able
[1:02:23] to control humans as humans are born on
[1:02:26] the earth. just through procreation.
[1:02:29] Uh any two uh uh man and woman come
[1:02:34] together can actually have a child
[1:02:36] through procreation. Amen. It didn't
[1:02:38] have to be from the lamb's book of life.
[1:02:40] Thus, we had a we had an an introduction
[1:02:43] of the book of life because God holds
[1:02:46] every life valuable. Amen. Every life is
[1:02:49] valuable. Every soul is worth 10 million
[1:02:52] worlds to God. We know that. Amen. And
[1:02:54] and so God records that life in a book.
[1:02:58] Amen. But that life in the book of
[1:03:01] that's the lamb's book of life is
[1:03:03] contained in that book. Uh contains
[1:03:05] every name. But in the lamb's book of
[1:03:07] life is still what has always been and
[1:03:10] always will be the names that God saw
[1:03:13] that was in his mind before the
[1:03:14] foundation of the world. Amen. So that
[1:03:17] book went as Adam lost it went into the
[1:03:21] hands of the original owner which was
[1:03:22] God Almighty. Right? Uh when Adam lost
[1:03:25] control over the earth over dominion of
[1:03:28] the earth although man is still to have
[1:03:30] dominion over the earth but lost its
[1:03:33] position in the earth as God of the
[1:03:35] earth or amateur god of the earth as as
[1:03:38] the almighty God gave them the p uh the
[1:03:41] position to be able to do that. He lost
[1:03:44] it into the hands of the one he lost it
[1:03:46] to which was Satan. So he lost this
[1:03:48] earth into the hands of Satan and all
[1:03:51] about it. It came into the hands of
[1:03:52] Satan. That's why again all creation is
[1:03:56] groaning waiting to get back to the
[1:03:59] place that it was before the fall. And
[1:04:02] what is that? That is the beginning
[1:04:04] where the beginning of that process is
[1:04:06] the manifested sons of God. When the
[1:04:09] manifested sons of God come into come
[1:04:12] into place, then that is the beginning
[1:04:14] the starting of that of that uh uh
[1:04:18] bringing forth of of uh the the rapture
[1:04:22] and uh the purification of the earth and
[1:04:25] everything is going to purify itself.
[1:04:28] Everything explode and and uh the earth
[1:04:30] is is now as brother Dennis uh prayed.
[1:04:35] didn't realize that it's going to be a
[1:04:36] part of what I was going to speak on
[1:04:38] today, but uh the the earth itself is
[1:04:41] groaning. Amen. You see the earth's
[1:04:43] belching, right? You see the the the the
[1:04:46] earthquakes taking place all over places
[1:04:49] you'd never heard of before. I read the
[1:04:51] other day one happened uh in North
[1:04:53] Carolina, Virginia area. We I don't
[1:04:56] remember ever hearing about earthquakes
[1:04:58] when I was a kid growing up in North
[1:04:59] Carolina. We've had them here in Tucson
[1:05:02] fairly recently, uh, down by the border,
[1:05:04] Mexico. You think, oh, these are all
[1:05:06] supposed to be in California. These are
[1:05:08] all supposed to be in the Ring of Fire
[1:05:10] or Japan or wherever the tsunamis and
[1:05:12] stuff. They're everywhere now because
[1:05:15] the earth is belching. The earth is
[1:05:17] volcanoes and explosions and things that
[1:05:21] the earth is beginning to purify itself
[1:05:24] because it recognizes and see as it's
[1:05:26] getting closer to that to that time.
[1:05:29] Humanity is seeing and recognizing God's
[1:05:32] bride is seeing and recognizing we're
[1:05:35] getting closer and closer to that time.
[1:05:37] Amen. And that manifested sons of God is
[1:05:40] that key. It's that it's that time that
[1:05:43] it's groaning for to get to that
[1:05:45] place. But now
[1:05:48] recognize
[1:05:49] when when we are expected when we have
[1:05:54] gotten to that place of the manifested
[1:05:58] sons of God comes with the
[1:06:00] responsibility to be able to to live as
[1:06:03] sons and daughters of God. manifested
[1:06:07] sons and daughters of God. There's a
[1:06:09] responsibility, amen, that comes with
[1:06:11] that. Uh, and recognizing your position
[1:06:14] again in the body of Christ. Recognizing
[1:06:18] that position, recognizing that adoption
[1:06:21] puts us in the place to understand what
[1:06:24] belongs to us today. What is our
[1:06:27] authority? What is our place? What has
[1:06:29] God given us? Amen. And we saw as we
[1:06:32] read, we'll read here again uh this
[1:06:35] quote that we read last week. See,
[1:06:37] because
[1:06:39] everything, Brother Ram taught us,
[1:06:41] everything that Adam
[1:06:42] lost has now come around and p brought
[1:06:47] full circle back into God, back into
[1:06:50] man's hands again. Right? We're still
[1:06:53] living in Satan's eating. We're still
[1:06:55] living in this sticky flesh. But that's
[1:06:57] the only thing that is separating the
[1:07:00] bride from its true position in Christ.
[1:07:03] Amen. Which we just read. That is to
[1:07:07] say, the redemption of our bodies. Amen.
[1:07:10] Amen. That's all we have left to work to
[1:07:12] to to to go through saints. We're
[1:07:14] looking for that that time that that
[1:07:17] that this body takes a change, a body
[1:07:19] change to it, the redemption of our
[1:07:22] bodies. That's the last part. That's the
[1:07:24] only thing we're looking for. But we
[1:07:26] understand that there's there's a
[1:07:28] position and a place that the bride
[1:07:31] takes. Amen. As she gets up and scales
[1:07:33] to that to that
[1:07:35] capstone and she scales and gets and and
[1:07:39] and narrows itself up to that capstone.
[1:07:42] This bride has its position now. Amen.
[1:07:46] Even before a body change, even before
[1:07:49] we see our loved ones, even before we
[1:07:52] all go to meet the Lord in the air,
[1:07:54] there's the position that God's given us
[1:07:57] here now. And that is to be a manifested
[1:08:00] son or daughter of God. Manifested that
[1:08:05] and recognize that everything that Adam
[1:08:09] lost the full circle that had come.
[1:08:11] Remember we read what Adam what was in
[1:08:14] Adam's control. We just reiterated again
[1:08:17] everything that was in Adam's control.
[1:08:19] Amen. Except of course for uh the book
[1:08:22] of life itself, but we're going to get
[1:08:24] to that. Amen. We're going to try to get
[1:08:26] to that today. Amen. I don't want to
[1:08:28] keep too long, but uh everything that
[1:08:32] Adam had, all of possession, I'll read
[1:08:34] it to you again in the breach message.
[1:08:37] If you go listen to the breach message,
[1:08:39] which I do advise anybody to do, I would
[1:08:42] not tell anybody not to listen to any
[1:08:44] tape of brother Brandham,
[1:08:47] um just be a little weary leerary of of
[1:08:51] uh some of the things that that he said.
[1:08:53] Not that they're wrong, but uh a lot of
[1:08:57] people have taken a from what I've seen
[1:09:00] in my experience coming up
[1:09:02] on can I add or subtract coming up on 37
[1:09:06] 38 years of ministry that I've seen a
[1:09:09] lot of the what I would
[1:09:13] consider cow in the tree picking grass
[1:09:16] out on the limb kind of doctrines. Uh
[1:09:19] I've seen several of them come from this
[1:09:21] message, the breach message. Amen. Um,
[1:09:25] some others too. Uh, Brother Brandham
[1:09:27] tal brother Green talked about uh the
[1:09:29] church age book things that uh that in
[1:09:33] the in in the uh translation or in the
[1:09:36] uh uh grammarization of it uh some
[1:09:40] things were changed uh to to say things
[1:09:43] that brother Vanam really actually
[1:09:45] didn't say. In fact, I was listening the
[1:09:47] other day again a little excerpt that
[1:09:49] brother Green had talked about that he
[1:09:51] had talked to brother Green about
[1:09:53] brother Brandham about and said this is
[1:09:55] what it says. And brother Brandham said
[1:09:57] and brother Green uh brother Brandham
[1:09:59] was like oh I I couldn't have said that
[1:10:02] because if I'd said that it would be
[1:10:04] anti-scripture, right? Because the Bible
[1:10:07] says you must be born again. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:10] He said so I couldn't have taught that.
[1:10:12] So, Brother Green's like, uh, Brother
[1:10:14] Green said, "Well, you know, uh, we've
[1:10:17] printed 20,000 copies, whatever it was.
[1:10:19] We've printed all these." He said,
[1:10:21] "Brother Green said, "We'll just take
[1:10:23] them and have the biggest bonfire you
[1:10:25] ever seen." You remember him saying
[1:10:26] that? "We had the biggest bonfire you
[1:10:28] ever seen," Brother Brandham? He said,
[1:10:29] "No, don't do that." He said, "We'll
[1:10:31] just let those go." He said, "Uh, we'll
[1:10:34] correct it on the next issue." Of
[1:10:36] course, Brother Brandham left us and
[1:10:38] there was no other issue. Amen. So that
[1:10:41] same church age book grammar is
[1:10:45] grammarized church age book. Now of
[1:10:47] course the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:49] which is the church ages as brother
[1:10:51] Brandham actually preached them is
[1:10:53] available but the grammarized church age
[1:10:56] book that's still out there still is the
[1:10:58] exact same way it was. Amen. So uh the
[1:11:04] good part about that is those with the
[1:11:07] Holy Ghost, the Lord will show what is
[1:11:10] what should or should not be a part of
[1:11:12] that uh uh uh book. Actually breach
[1:11:19] brother Brandham was the breach message
[1:11:22] was preached before the first angel come
[1:11:25] for the first seal to speak to him about
[1:11:28] it. Right? The breach was preached with
[1:11:30] great expectation,
[1:11:32] anticipation. So was souls in prison and
[1:11:36] uh messages like that. Trying to think
[1:11:39] of the other one, but that that brother
[1:11:40] Brand that there was great anticipation,
[1:11:43] expectation. Brother Brandham talked
[1:11:45] about even in souls that are in prison
[1:11:48] now. Brother Brandham said, "Could that
[1:11:50] be right
[1:11:52] now?" Well, we're we're 62 years later,
[1:11:57] right? So we know it wasn't then. Amen.
[1:12:01] He said, "Lord, I hope it's not." But
[1:12:03] you see, as brother Brandham went in the
[1:12:06] presumption of those things, um, as time
[1:12:09] went on and as his ministry went on,
[1:12:11] even from this the breach, as his
[1:12:14] ministry went
[1:12:16] on, the truth came forth. Amen. uh which
[1:12:21] to me more or less I I don't want to say
[1:12:24] corrected but updated what brother
[1:12:27] Brandham said here. Brother Brandham was
[1:12:30] preaching scripture here and we know the
[1:12:33] scripture is the truth. Amen. And to
[1:12:36] preach the scripture but brother
[1:12:38] Brandham preached things that people
[1:12:40] took as literal right then right there
[1:12:43] happening at that moment and it wasn't
[1:12:46] right. It was things that brother
[1:12:47] Brandon was talking about scripture that
[1:12:49] was coming up. Could have been right
[1:12:52] then, could have been a hundred years
[1:12:54] down the road, he said. But it's going
[1:12:56] to happen. It's going to be like uh uh
[1:13:00] like the uh we said several times about
[1:13:03] uh uh the u the period of time where
[1:13:09] they'll the they'll we'll still be here
[1:13:12] and it it'll be over, right? will still
[1:13:16] be here, but there'll be no more souls
[1:13:18] saved. Amen. Like brother Vanam typed it
[1:13:22] like Noah on the ark. Noah went on the
[1:13:24] ark, but it was a whole week before
[1:13:26] judgment struck. Amen. But from the time
[1:13:30] Noah got on the ark till judgment and
[1:13:33] after nobody could get on that or off
[1:13:36] that ark, right? Amen. It was over. That
[1:13:39] was it. And brother Ram said there that
[1:13:41] will be there is a period of time like
[1:13:43] that. He likened that period of time to
[1:13:46] when he was here. But we know we know
[1:13:49] now 60some years later that wasn't so.
[1:13:53] Amen. I still don't believe it's so. In
[1:13:56] fact, I think brother Ram said at one
[1:13:58] point uh even if it is, we don't need to
[1:14:01] think like that. We need to we still
[1:14:03] need to try to do all that we can to
[1:14:06] help others come to Christ. Right? Uh, I
[1:14:09] think I per I've told you my personal
[1:14:12] opinion and this is my personal opinion
[1:14:14] and that's all it is. Amen. That and
[1:14:17] five bucks will get you a loaf of bread
[1:14:18] at the grocery store. But it's just my
[1:14:22] opinion. I believe that period of time
[1:14:24] will be after the dead appear before us.
[1:14:28] I believe the time where the the dead in
[1:14:31] Christ are here and we actually go in
[1:14:34] the rapture, that period of time,
[1:14:36] minimum of 30 days. Brother Brandham,
[1:14:38] Brother Green says, Brother Brandham
[1:14:39] said, a minimum 30 days. That period of
[1:14:41] time, I believe personally, no more, no
[1:14:44] more will come in. That'll be it.
[1:14:47] There'll be church services and people
[1:14:48] coming to the altar and crying and
[1:14:50] things going on, but the door will be
[1:14:52] shut at that point. Right. Amen. just
[1:14:55] like uh Matthew 25 door will be shut and
[1:15:00] then the rest from that point will go on
[1:15:03] into the tribulation. But I I I didn't
[1:15:07] mean to preface this quote with all that
[1:15:09] I said, but uh
[1:15:12] sometimes, you know, to to get to a
[1:15:14] certain point, uh you got to kind of
[1:15:17] understand what we're going through,
[1:15:19] what's happening. And a lot of that has
[1:15:21] come out of that. Amen. out of this
[1:15:24] message. A lot has come. Uh it's amazing
[1:15:26] because uh uh I I was sitting with great
[1:15:31] anticipation week before last. Um and as
[1:15:35] I was sitting there waiting and the
[1:15:38] whole world was waiting, is it going to
[1:15:40] be black smoke or white smoke? And I'm I
[1:15:43] and I'm waiting. I'm great I'm greatly
[1:15:46] anticipating. And I just got something
[1:15:48] that came over me uh before that white
[1:15:52] smoke and I thought and and it it it and
[1:15:54] it spoke to me that it's going to be the
[1:15:56] American
[1:15:58] Pope. I just believed I knew. So in the
[1:16:01] SM that then not long after that the
[1:16:03] white smoke started coming out like oh
[1:16:05] there it is. There he is. it' be
[1:16:08] announced here in the next hour or so,
[1:16:09] whatever it is, because there's that
[1:16:11] white smoke and then everybody's gonna
[1:16:13] be and then wasn't long after that, you
[1:16:16] pick up Facebook and everybody's uh the
[1:16:19] Pope from America and the quote from
[1:16:21] Brother Random and which is all true and
[1:16:23] that's right and I agree with 100%.
[1:16:26] Everybody I read another one that says,
[1:16:28] "I guess I know what every preacher's
[1:16:30] message is going to be on Sunday." I
[1:16:32] said, "No, I I I don't necessarily have
[1:16:36] a particular message on that for you
[1:16:39] other than what I've already preached to
[1:16:40] you before. Uh these it's like I said,
[1:16:45] it's u um it's modern events made clear
[1:16:50] by prophecy, not the other way around."
[1:16:52] So, uh we have to make sure we keep
[1:16:55] ourselves clear with that. Amen. We just
[1:16:58] we know it's at the end time. And
[1:17:01] honestly, uh, I'll just say this real
[1:17:03] quick. I honestly believe we've got the
[1:17:05] right president in office for this all
[1:17:08] to come to unfold right now. I really
[1:17:10] do. Um, that that's my opinion, but I I
[1:17:15] definitely feel that way. And we'll see
[1:17:18] in the next few years over this next uh
[1:17:22] the term. Of course, this this pope is
[1:17:24] really young, too. He's Yeah. Uh 59 69.
[1:17:27] I forgot. 69. 69.
[1:17:30] Uh, the president has got three and a
[1:17:34] half more years in office. Uh, I could
[1:17:37] see it happening in the next few years,
[1:17:38] saints. I really could. Amen. Amen. I
[1:17:41] actually could see it happening in the
[1:17:42] next few days.
[1:17:45] But Lord knows a lot of it's coming to
[1:17:48] pass right now. But let me read this
[1:17:50] quote. The breach
[1:17:53] message. Um, brother Ram said it's
[1:17:56] redemption means all legal possession to
[1:18:01] all that was lost by Adam and Eve. Now
[1:18:04] that redemption, what is that? Have you
[1:18:06] been Have I Have you been redeemed?
[1:18:09] Amen. Amen. I've been redeemed by the
[1:18:11] blood of the lamb. Yeah. That
[1:18:13] redemption, God redeeming that
[1:18:17] back means all legal possession to all
[1:18:21] that was lost by Adam and Eve. Now what
[1:18:23] does legal possession mean? That means
[1:18:26] that what is what it's done is
[1:18:30] lawful. Lawful not to the laws of our
[1:18:34] country, not to the laws of the world,
[1:18:36] but to God's law. And that's the law we
[1:18:39] need to worry about, care about, think
[1:18:41] about. Legal
[1:18:44] possession. So legally, you legally
[1:18:47] possess all that was lost by Adam and
[1:18:50] Eve. It's legal possession. Where is the
[1:18:54] legal possession of everything that was
[1:18:57] lost by Adam and Eve? And we read all
[1:18:59] that was all all that was possessed by
[1:19:02] them. All that Adam was able to do as
[1:19:05] God of the earth. All that legal
[1:19:08] possession now that legal possession
[1:19:11] left.
[1:19:13] Now it's come and it's redemption claims
[1:19:16] through the cross by Jesus Christ
[1:19:19] brought it right back into man's hands
[1:19:22] again. Right? Look that redemption
[1:19:24] claims through all legal possession lost
[1:19:27] by Adam and
[1:19:29] Eve. He said he said oh my what that
[1:19:32] ought to do to a born again Christian.
[1:19:36] It's legal
[1:19:38] possession to the abstract deed, titled
[1:19:41] deed of eternal
[1:19:43] life means that you
[1:19:46] possess Oh, listen now. This is this is
[1:19:50] not skin milk,
[1:19:52] saints. Eternal life. That title deed to
[1:19:57] eternal life means that you
[1:20:00] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:20:03] lost.
[1:20:05] You possess it. Amen. Everything that
[1:20:08] Adam and Eve lost, could name, could
[1:20:10] say, could speak, could stop nature,
[1:20:12] could do what he wanted. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:14] Everything that was lost, now is in our
[1:20:17] possession. You say, "What is the
[1:20:19] scriptural reference to that, Brother
[1:20:20] Newton?" Well, we read it the other day.
[1:20:22] Shall I read it again?
[1:20:27] We could read it. We could paraphrase
[1:20:29] it. Matthew chapter 17.
[1:20:34] What did Jesus tell them that was
[1:20:36] standing there? Their faith was so weak
[1:20:39] they couldn't heal that epileptic
[1:20:42] voice. What did Jesus tell them
[1:20:46] then? Because of your
[1:20:49] unbelief, for verily I say unto you, if
[1:20:52] ye have faith as grain of a mustard
[1:20:54] seed. Now, where should our faith be?
[1:20:58] realizing that a prophet of that God
[1:21:01] through a prophet of God just told us
[1:21:04] that we possess everything that Adam
[1:21:07] lost. Amen. We now possess
[1:21:11] it. What does that mean to
[1:21:14] us? Verily I say unto you, if you have
[1:21:17] faith the grain of a mustard seed, ye
[1:21:19] shall say unto this mountain, remove
[1:21:22] hence to yonder place, and it shall
[1:21:25] remove, and nothing shall be impossible
[1:21:29] unto you. Amen. You want a scripture
[1:21:31] reference? That's the best one I know
[1:21:33] of. Amen. There's others obviously, but
[1:21:37] realizing that Jesus put in our hands
[1:21:40] the ability and the legal
[1:21:43] possession to speak name say do what we
[1:21:48] of course according to the spirit of God
[1:21:51] would have to be done that God would put
[1:21:54] that in the hands of the bride for this
[1:21:55] last day. Now she has become the
[1:21:58] possessor of everything that Adam and
[1:22:00] Eve lost. Right? It belongs to us now.
[1:22:04] Jesus said if you have faith the grain
[1:22:06] of a mustard seed. Now again he says how
[1:22:08] be it these come not but be but by by
[1:22:10] prayer and fasting but if you say to
[1:22:13] this mountain be moved and cast into
[1:22:16] into the sea it has to obey
[1:22:18] you what greater understanding of what
[1:22:21] Adam lost. That's exactly what Adam
[1:22:23] possessed.
[1:22:25] Move this shade tree. Tell this animal.
[1:22:28] Move this mountain. He could command it
[1:22:30] to do whatever whatever he wanted it to
[1:22:32] do.
[1:22:34] Amen. And with the nature of God and
[1:22:37] with the spirit of Jesus Christ moving
[1:22:40] through you when he unconscions you and
[1:22:43] gives you that to speak, it is yours to
[1:22:46] speak. It is yours to say. It is yours
[1:22:50] to command. It is yours to command.
[1:22:54] Yeah. when brother Brandham when his
[1:22:56] wife was sick of that tumor and he went
[1:22:59] to his knees one more time as his do as
[1:23:01] his wife was going to the doctor to the
[1:23:03] hospital for the operation. Brother
[1:23:05] Vanam went to his knees to pray and God
[1:23:08] said, "Stand on your feet and speak what
[1:23:12] you want to happen." Amen. Praise the
[1:23:16] Lord. Brother Ram's in the woods. He
[1:23:18] said, "What are you here for?" "Squirrel
[1:23:20] hunting." "Well, how many you need?"
[1:23:23] Well, he knew three squirrels made a
[1:23:25] good stew for pot to feed his family. I
[1:23:28] need three. Amen. Speak
[1:23:32] it. Speak it. Amen. This be here. Here.
[1:23:35] You say that's crazy. That was brother
[1:23:37] Brandham. Uh, excuse me. I I don't think
[1:23:41] that brother Brandham said he said all
[1:23:43] that Adam and Eve lost now that I
[1:23:46] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:23:49] lost. He didn't say that.
[1:23:52] He didn't say if you have faith the gra
[1:23:54] of a mustard seed William Brandham you
[1:23:55] shall say to this
[1:23:57] mountain. It doesn't say that. It says
[1:24:01] you. He said you
[1:24:05] possess we possess. The bride possessed
[1:24:09] everything Adam lost. If you say to this
[1:24:13] mountain, Amen. Not just a prophet.
[1:24:18] Yes, he was in that situation. But
[1:24:20] brother Random told us that what you've
[1:24:22] seen temporarily in my ministry through
[1:24:25] these few things of the speak spoken
[1:24:27] word, you'll see in the fullness done
[1:24:30] through the bride. Amen. Oh God help us.
[1:24:33] Yes. Amen. It's given to us. Yes. You
[1:24:37] say we go to prayer for that. Sure, I'm
[1:24:39] okay with that. But when God says speak,
[1:24:42] you speak. Yeah. Amen. Amen. There is no
[1:24:45] asking. It is your possession to do. If
[1:24:49] God tells you, shows you to do
[1:24:51] something, you do it. Yes. You don't go
[1:24:54] say, "Well, God, uh, I need your help
[1:24:57] with this." Well, we all know that. He
[1:25:00] knows that. We always need his help. But
[1:25:02] when God says, "Do something, do
[1:25:04] it." When the spirit of God is touching
[1:25:07] you, do it. Say
[1:25:09] it. If there's sickness, if there's
[1:25:13] uh a a problem, some kind of a a
[1:25:16] disability, speak to it. Amen.
[1:25:20] Believe. Have faith. Amen. Now, make
[1:25:23] sure it's the will of the Lord. Yeah.
[1:25:25] Amen. You can pray something off some
[1:25:28] somebody that God put there for their
[1:25:30] correction or something and God will
[1:25:31] hold you responsible for that. Make sure
[1:25:33] it's the will of the Lord. But when you
[1:25:36] know you've got God, you speak, right?
[1:25:39] Amen. And we also have the scripture
[1:25:43] that tells us if we lay hands on the
[1:25:46] sick they shall recover. We have that as
[1:25:48] a blanket scripture that we know to be
[1:25:51] the truth for us. Amen. And just because
[1:25:55] you can't physically put your hand on
[1:25:57] somebody doesn't mean you can't
[1:25:59] spiritually put your hand on them,
[1:26:00] right? Pray for them. Call on God for
[1:26:03] them. Amen. Amen. Just because it can't
[1:26:06] be physical doesn't mean that God
[1:26:08] doesn't hear. doesn't mean that God
[1:26:10] doesn't know. Amen. Praise the Lord. All
[1:26:14] this that God has shown us. Now, let's
[1:26:17] go
[1:26:19] um to
[1:26:22] Colossians, excuse me, let's go uh let's
[1:26:25] go a little further over in in Romans
[1:26:28] the 16th chapter. Romans 16.
[1:26:38] Romans
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:44] 16:25. Romans 16:25. Now to him that is
[1:26:49] of power to establish you according to
[1:26:52] my
[1:26:53] gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:26:57] according to the revelation of the
[1:27:00] mystery. Revelation of mystery. Amen. A
[1:27:05] mystery is something hid. A revelation
[1:27:07] is something that has uncovered
[1:27:09] something that was hid. Right?
[1:27:11] Revelation of the mystery which was kept
[1:27:15] secret since the world began.
[1:27:19] But now is made manifest and by the
[1:27:22] scriptures of the prophets according to
[1:27:25] the commandment of the everlasting uh of
[1:27:27] the everlasting God made known to all
[1:27:31] nations for the obedience of faith to
[1:27:33] God only uh to God only wise be glory
[1:27:36] through Jesus Christ forever. Amen. Now
[1:27:39] let's one more scripture. We got a
[1:27:41] couple more scriptures.
[1:27:44] Colossians chapter 26 uh chapter 1 verse
[1:27:48] 26 Colossians 1:26 even the mystery
[1:27:52] which had been hid from ages and from
[1:27:56] generations but now is made manifest to
[1:27:59] his saints.
[1:28:01] Praise the Lord. A mystery was hid.
[1:28:03] Daniel spoke of it. He started to get a
[1:28:06] glimpse. God said, "Seal it up." Amen.
[1:28:10] John the Revelator started to get it.
[1:28:11] God said, "Seal it up." Let's go over
[1:28:14] Revelation chapter
[1:28:20] 10.
[1:28:23] Amen. Looking at Revelation chapter 5
[1:28:25] for just a moment, I don't want to read
[1:28:27] it. Read the whole thing, but you can
[1:28:29] read it if you've not read it. You see
[1:28:32] that this book of redemption that Adam
[1:28:37] lost went to the hands of the original
[1:28:39] owner, God.
[1:28:41] God sitting here in the fifth chapter of
[1:28:43] Revelation with that book in his hand,
[1:28:46] but the book is closed
[1:28:48] and a mighty angel comes forth and
[1:28:51] declares, "Who is worthy to take that
[1:28:54] book and to loose those seals?" Amen.
[1:28:59] And John started weeping because no man
[1:29:02] was found worthy. Yes.
[1:29:05] Nobody, not even brother Brown was found
[1:29:09] worthy. Paul was not found worthy. No
[1:29:11] man was found worthy. Yes. To even look
[1:29:14] on the book much less touch it or open
[1:29:17] it. Yes. Amen. But one of the elders
[1:29:20] cried, "We've not, John, for the lion of
[1:29:24] the tribe of Judah has
[1:29:26] prevailed to take that book and to
[1:29:29] loosen those seals." John turned to look
[1:29:32] to see a lion which is a representative
[1:29:34] of a judgment. Amen. Judge.
[1:29:38] Amen. Remember lamb is mercy. Yes.
[1:29:42] Praise the Lord. Grace, mercy. The lamb
[1:29:44] is uh the the lion is
[1:29:47] judgment. So he is both lion and lamb.
[1:29:51] He gives grace. But friend, one day it's
[1:29:54] going to switch and he's going to come
[1:29:56] forth as the lion. When he come forth to
[1:29:58] take this book, John turned around and
[1:30:00] looked and he saw a bloody lamb that had
[1:30:04] been slain from the foundation of the
[1:30:06] world.
[1:30:07] Praise God. Amen. You say, "Well, that
[1:30:09] was only a a short time, a thousand
[1:30:12] years earlier or whatever, 2,000 years
[1:30:14] earlier as we look back now." So, that
[1:30:16] was just that was just No, it was before
[1:30:18] the God had that in his mind before the
[1:30:20] foundation of the world. Yes. The lamb
[1:30:23] that was slain now was worthy to take
[1:30:26] that book and to loose those seals and
[1:30:29] to open that book. Now when you look at
[1:30:31] Revelation 10 1, I saw a mighty angel,
[1:30:35] another mighty angel come down from
[1:30:37] heaven clothed with a cloud. A rainbow
[1:30:39] was upon his head. He was Jesus Christ,
[1:30:41] the covenant angel. Amen. With the
[1:30:43] rainbow of his head, which the the wrong
[1:30:47] people are trying to steal from us
[1:30:48] today, right? But it doesn't matter
[1:30:50] because it's still God's with a rainbow
[1:30:53] over his
[1:30:55] head and his face was as it were the
[1:30:58] sun. His feet as pillars of fire. as
[1:31:00] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. The lamb that
[1:31:03] had just come forth to take the book is
[1:31:06] now recorded in Revelation 10. And he
[1:31:08] had in his hand a little book open. Now
[1:31:11] the book's open. Why? Because the lamb
[1:31:14] was worthy to take the book and to open
[1:31:16] the book and to loose the seals. Amen.
[1:31:20] He was able to do that and had had that
[1:31:24] book uh the little book open. He set his
[1:31:26] right foot upon the sea and left foot
[1:31:28] upon the earth, which a lot of people I
[1:31:31] have a different understanding. I have
[1:31:32] revelation of that than a lot of people.
[1:31:34] But if you jump down to the seventh vers
[1:31:36] uh the seventh yeah seventh verse now,
[1:31:39] amen. Notice he coming down with that
[1:31:42] book in his hand
[1:31:44] open. Now the seventh verse says, "But
[1:31:47] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:31:49] angel," praise the Lord. Amen. There was
[1:31:52] to be a seventh angel. Yes. which we
[1:31:54] know without going into great detail,
[1:31:56] we're all mature Christians in the
[1:31:58] message. We know to be brother Brown.
[1:32:00] Yes. The seventh angel messenger in the
[1:32:03] days of his voice of that seventh angel
[1:32:06] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:32:09] of God should be finished. The mystery
[1:32:12] should be finished. Now you go over look
[1:32:14] and say they said, "But these mysteries
[1:32:16] that were hid from ages and generations
[1:32:19] is now being revealed, now being
[1:32:21] manifested." Of course it was. God
[1:32:24] always allows his bride, his people to
[1:32:27] be a part of his life, which is his
[1:32:29] word. Amen. All down through the church
[1:32:31] ages, all down through the times, even
[1:32:33] through the dark ages, they were able to
[1:32:36] be uh to have a part of that of that
[1:32:40] word in their lives. In fact, they would
[1:32:43] be um I I if children at that
[1:32:48] time were able to quote
[1:32:51] scripture, they were killed and their
[1:32:54] parents were
[1:32:55] killed. And if their grandparents were
[1:32:58] in the home, they were killed, murdered,
[1:33:02] ripped apart, all the manner of things
[1:33:04] they did in the Fox book of martyrs,
[1:33:06] right? Killed, murdered just because
[1:33:09] they could quote scripture. God always
[1:33:11] has a way for his people to get the
[1:33:14] word. Always. Amen. Amen. Always has a
[1:33:18] way. So yes, that word was revealed. But
[1:33:21] look what it
[1:33:23] says. In the days of the voice of the
[1:33:26] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:33:28] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:33:30] what?
[1:33:32] Not
[1:33:33] started. Not midway through.
[1:33:36] Not a little probe here and there but
[1:33:39] should be finished. Amen. Yeah. Praise
[1:33:42] God. So the finishing of that through
[1:33:45] the opening of that book was to happen
[1:33:48] through the seventh angel messenger
[1:33:50] which is today which is the bride which
[1:33:53] is brother Brandham and the bride of
[1:33:54] Christ for this
[1:33:55] day. Amen. Yeah. Oh they had the mystery
[1:33:59] things that they were showing of course
[1:34:00] Paul's ministry. If Paul, if there
[1:34:03] wasn't opening of word, if there wasn't
[1:34:05] truth of scripture that were to be
[1:34:08] preached during that time, what would
[1:34:10] God have needed for Peter or Paul? What
[1:34:13] would have been the point of Paul's
[1:34:15] ministry here if he had not brought
[1:34:17] those things, even stripes and types and
[1:34:19] shadows of the Old Testament through
[1:34:21] into the New Testament to explain and to
[1:34:24] minister that we read it even today,
[1:34:28] right? Of course, it was the word that
[1:34:31] was being revealed. Of course, it was
[1:34:34] mysteries that was being made known. But
[1:34:37] we know that the opening of this word
[1:34:40] for this last day given into the hands
[1:34:43] of a prophet,
[1:34:44] God revealing that word to his people,
[1:34:48] revealing to his people who they are and
[1:34:52] what they possess today. Amen.
[1:34:55] who we are, what we have, what is your
[1:34:58] position. That's what we're talking
[1:35:00] about adoption. What is your position?
[1:35:03] Amen. In that position, in that
[1:35:06] placement comes great responsibility.
[1:35:09] Again, what? Speaking of the word, the
[1:35:13] word being revealed to us. Now, we know
[1:35:17] that through the seventh angel
[1:35:19] messenger, God himself reveals it. I've
[1:35:22] told you several
[1:35:24] times I I
[1:35:26] I politely disagree with what's written
[1:35:31] on the front of the seal book.
[1:35:34] It says the revelation of the seven
[1:35:36] seals, but a revelation is a personal
[1:35:39] thing. Amen. Right?
[1:35:41] somebody out on the street or some
[1:35:44] atheist could go read that book all they
[1:35:46] want front to back for 50 times and
[1:35:50] not excuse me not get the revelation of
[1:35:53] it right the revelation comes from God
[1:35:56] the revelation didn't come from brother
[1:35:58] Brandham it comes from God brother
[1:36:01] Brandham through God preached the truth
[1:36:03] of those seals and we can see it as it's
[1:36:06] unfolded through the entire scripture to
[1:36:08] us now but the The revelation of that
[1:36:11] has to come from God. Amen. God gives
[1:36:14] you that revelation. Amen. It's a
[1:36:17] personalized thing that each one of us
[1:36:20] are able to possess today because of the
[1:36:22] truth coming to us. That's why when you
[1:36:25] can look at that and you can read it, it
[1:36:27] may that's why it made the Bible a new
[1:36:29] book as brother Random said. Amen. Yeah.
[1:36:32] Because it opened the whole thing. Now
[1:36:35] you can look and see. Oh, praise the
[1:36:37] Lord. Amen.
[1:36:40] through an open book, through the
[1:36:43] seventh angel messenger. Yes. Through a
[1:36:46] prophet for this last day that brought
[1:36:49] it to our
[1:36:50] knowing. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:54] We're such a blessed people today, s
[1:36:56] Yes, we are.
[1:36:59] Living in such a time, we don't even
[1:37:01] realize it. Amen. I want to read a
[1:37:04] couple quotes here before I close.
[1:37:07] Adoption number three. Now
[1:37:10] listen, I ask a historian. Now this is
[1:37:13] on tape. Now anybody has any question. I
[1:37:15] know nobody in here does, but there may
[1:37:17] be people watch this. Listen to this.
[1:37:20] This goes on tape. This goes all around
[1:37:22] the world. I ask any historian to come
[1:37:25] to me and bring me any text of scripture
[1:37:28] or any text of
[1:37:30] history, any verse of of history that
[1:37:34] ever showed that any Protestant that
[1:37:37] anybody ever baptized in the name of
[1:37:40] father, soul, son, and holy ghost until
[1:37:42] the Catholic Church ordained it in the
[1:37:45] at the Nian council. Okay. Now, that's
[1:37:47] quite a challenge, especially now, it
[1:37:50] wouldn't be for me because I'm a nobody.
[1:37:53] Nobody knows me. But for an a a minister
[1:37:56] like brother Brandham at this point of
[1:37:59] his ministry, an international minister
[1:38:02] has gone around the world, prayed for
[1:38:05] people, preached to people. for him to
[1:38:07] make this statement and for those takes
[1:38:09] to go around the world. Look, for him to
[1:38:12] put to to put down the
[1:38:15] challenge to
[1:38:17] anybody, show him any place in the
[1:38:20] scripture or in history where anybody
[1:38:24] was ever baptized in the name of father,
[1:38:26] son, and holy ghost until the Catholic
[1:38:27] Church canonize it at NASA Rome. Amen.
[1:38:31] You won't find it. He said, "Now that's
[1:38:34] on tape. goes across the world. 37
[1:38:37] different languages are translated in.
[1:38:39] I'll pray, which is kind of interesting.
[1:38:41] I wonder 1960 if it actually was
[1:38:43] translated in 37 languages. I know it is
[1:38:46] today. Makes me wonder if Brother
[1:38:48] Brandham's looking in the future and
[1:38:50] seeing what's going on today when it was
[1:38:53] about. I'd be curious to know if uh what
[1:38:56] Brother Green were here. 37 languages in
[1:38:59] 1960.
[1:39:01] I don't know about you, it seems a
[1:39:02] little that doesn't seem plausible to
[1:39:04] me, but maybe it was. I don't know.
[1:39:07] Anyway, I just read that and it just
[1:39:09] came to me. Uh 37 languages. Wow. Okay.
[1:39:13] They're translated. I'll pay your way.
[1:39:15] Brother Bam said, I'll pay your way
[1:39:18] across the ocean. That's right. Father,
[1:39:21] Son, the Holy Ghost is a false bogus
[1:39:24] Catholic dogma. Amen. Amen. I don't know
[1:39:28] how to say that any planer. read it any
[1:39:30] better. It is a bogus Catholic dogma and
[1:39:34] not a Christian baptism. That's right.
[1:39:38] Luther brought it back in the Catholic
[1:39:39] uh church with catechism. Wes he adopted
[1:39:42] and come on. But this is the day of the
[1:39:44] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:39:46] the mysteries has been hid from the
[1:39:48] foundation of the world is to be made
[1:39:51] known. This is that hour. Amen. This is
[1:39:55] that time, saints. Yes, we're living at
[1:39:58] that time. Yes, we are. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:00] And it behooves us. It falls on us. It
[1:40:04] comes our responsibility
[1:40:06] to produce that word today.
[1:40:10] She will have thus sayeth the Lord or
[1:40:13] she'll keep quiet. Yes.
[1:40:17] Amen. By
[1:40:20] God. But that is our
[1:40:22] position. I it seems to me that we
[1:40:26] suffer so needlessly sometimes. Yes.
[1:40:30] When we have the authority to speak
[1:40:33] absolutely to say to command
[1:40:38] as God has given
[1:40:40] us. Brother God didn't tell go back to
[1:40:43] this analogy. God did not God did not
[1:40:46] tell the prophet I hear your prayer. He
[1:40:49] said, "Stand to your
[1:40:51] feet and speak it." Amen. Don't ask me.
[1:40:56] Amen. Don't talk to me. Speak it. Yes.
[1:41:00] Praise
[1:41:01] God. That command had to be
[1:41:05] obeyed. Before the doctor's hands can
[1:41:07] touch it, it'll be gone. Yes.
[1:41:11] even to the part to where the the
[1:41:14] the sheet goes back and he goes to put
[1:41:16] his hand on it and it
[1:41:18] disappears. Dissipates before the doctor
[1:41:21] can touch it because that's what he
[1:41:22] said, right?
[1:41:25] Reminds me of the the the uh enhancement
[1:41:29] of the story about the squirrels. He got
[1:41:31] the first two, shot them up in the right
[1:41:33] eye, with his 22 rifle. And the third
[1:41:37] one, he says, "Okay, I'm gonna make this
[1:41:39] one impossible. Come across here and
[1:41:41] jump over that limb and go up that tree
[1:41:43] and go this way and go over there." And
[1:41:45] I forgot all of what he did, but he made
[1:41:46] the squirrel go all do all kind of
[1:41:48] things and do all this stuff. Run up
[1:41:50] that tree, which a squirrel never goes
[1:41:51] in. You'll never see a squirrel. Uh I
[1:41:54] don't remember what it was. I know
[1:41:55] squirrels don't like pine trees. They
[1:41:56] used to do a lot of squirrel hunting.
[1:41:57] And squirrels don't like pine trees.
[1:42:00] They like hardwood trees. Go up this
[1:42:03] tree, come on on that limb, and sit
[1:42:04] right there. And that squirrel came
[1:42:06] forth, did exactly exactly what he said,
[1:42:10] went right up that Zach tree, came up
[1:42:12] that exact lip and came over and stared
[1:42:13] at him. He shot him in the right eye.
[1:42:17] Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, that was
[1:42:19] brother
[1:42:21] Brown. I don't think I need to reiterate
[1:42:24] the scripture to us again. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:28] Yeah, it is for him, but it's for us.
[1:42:32] Amen. Amen. You have faith. Yes. Praise
[1:42:35] the Lord. You have faith. Adoption four.
[1:42:38] Let me read this. I'll close. And now
[1:42:40] this, brother said, this may just choke
[1:42:43] you to death, but did you know that men
[1:42:46] that are sons of God are amateur gods?
[1:42:51] How many ever know that? How many knows
[1:42:53] that Jesus said so? The Bible, Jesus
[1:42:57] said, "Did not your law say itself that
[1:43:00] ye are God's?" And if you call them
[1:43:03] gods, which the word of God came to, and
[1:43:05] he stops there, which God said in
[1:43:07] Genesis 2, that they were gods, because
[1:43:09] they had full dominion of the dominion
[1:43:12] over, full domain over the minion of the
[1:43:15] world. He gave him dominion over all
[1:43:18] things. And he lost his godship. He lost
[1:43:22] his sunship. He lost his domain. And
[1:43:25] Satan took it over.
[1:43:29] But
[1:43:30] brother, we are waiting for the
[1:43:33] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:43:36] will come back and take it over again.
[1:43:39] Amen.
[1:43:40] Amen. Yes. Well, if we're at the end
[1:43:43] time, friend, who are these people going
[1:43:44] to be? If we're still waiting for this
[1:43:47] to happen, this is one of my one of the
[1:43:50] things I exasperated on the most. If
[1:43:53] we're if we're still waiting for
[1:43:56] manifestation of sons of God then and
[1:44:01] but yet we're expecting the coming of
[1:44:02] the Lord any day. That's contradictory.
[1:44:07] If we believe, if we truly believe that
[1:44:11] the coming of the Lord is at any day
[1:44:13] now, and I do, yes, even more so
[1:44:16] now, and I do, then where are we at in
[1:44:20] regards to the manifesting sons of God?
[1:44:24] Amen. We're here. Yes. It it just seems
[1:44:28] like people get so discouraged because
[1:44:30] they think that we're supposed to go a
[1:44:33] every day or something and just speak
[1:44:35] and all this everywhere. This is
[1:44:38] supposed to be a daily occurrence. No,
[1:44:39] it's not.
[1:44:42] Five times. How old was brother Brandon
[1:44:44] when he when he passed? 56. 56.
[1:44:48] How many times it happened in his life?
[1:44:50] Five times.
[1:44:52] Now we know all the other things but the
[1:44:53] spoken word and and he told us that was
[1:44:56] just an example for us. Yes. He told us
[1:45:00] that what you've seen temporarily these
[1:45:03] things happen in my ministry you'll see
[1:45:05] in the fullness in the
[1:45:08] bride. Well then where are we? What day
[1:45:11] are we living? Amen. I believe we're
[1:45:14] living in this day right now ourselves
[1:45:17] personally.
[1:45:18] If you can look back and think in your
[1:45:20] life in times where even recently these
[1:45:24] things have happened in your life. Amen.
[1:45:27] Something you've asked for, something
[1:45:28] you spoke, something you've prayed for,
[1:45:31] whatever it be, God still I'm not saying
[1:45:33] God doesn't honor your prayer. Of
[1:45:35] course, God honors our prayer.
[1:45:37] Absolutely. Amen. But it's a time, too,
[1:45:40] that we the Lord puts it on your heart.
[1:45:42] Just speak it. Do it. Yes. Amen. Praise
[1:45:45] the Lord. I believe we're at that time,
[1:45:49] but it's not it's not an everyday
[1:45:50] occurrence. It comes when it happens,
[1:45:52] when it's needful, when we have need of
[1:45:54] it. Amen.
[1:45:57] Who will come back? We're waiting for
[1:45:59] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:46:01] Who will come back, shall I say, who are
[1:46:03] here uh to take it over again.
[1:46:07] Full circle, waiting for the fullness of
[1:46:10] time when the pyramid gets to the top.
[1:46:12] When the full sons of God will be
[1:46:14] manifested, when the power of God will
[1:46:16] walk out, hallelujah, and will take
[1:46:19] every power that Satan's got away from
[1:46:22] him. Amen. Glory to
[1:46:25] God. Where we will walk out and take
[1:46:28] every power that Satan has got away from
[1:46:32] him. Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. It
[1:46:35] belongs to him. Who? That manifested son
[1:46:38] or daughter of God belongs to us. take
[1:46:41] every power that Satan has got away from
[1:46:45] him. Amen. I I we're just at that time
[1:46:49] frame. I don't know how else to see it.
[1:46:54] He's got the logos that went out of God.
[1:46:56] That is true. That was the son of God.
[1:46:58] Then he made man little gods. He said if
[1:47:02] they call those, the word of God came to
[1:47:03] prophet. They called them gods who the
[1:47:05] word of God came to. God said to so
[1:47:07] himself that they were gods. He told
[1:47:10] Moses, "I made you a god and made Aaron
[1:47:12] your prophet." Amen. I may act
[1:47:15] religious, he said, crank, but uh but
[1:47:17] I'm not. Uh he said, "Oh, when your eyes
[1:47:20] can come open, when your eyes can come
[1:47:23] open and see those things." All right.
[1:47:26] He made man of God, a God in his domain,
[1:47:28] and his domain goes from sea to sea,
[1:47:30] shore to shore. Again, my understanding,
[1:47:33] my revelation of when Jesus came with
[1:47:36] the book open and put his foot, one foot
[1:47:38] on land and one foot on sea, that
[1:47:40] covered the whole thing. Right? Amen.
[1:47:43] People make something different out of
[1:47:45] that. I won't go into that, but that's
[1:47:47] my revelation of it.
[1:47:49] Short to shore, he has control of it.
[1:47:51] When Jesus came, being the one God
[1:47:53] without sin, he proved it. When the
[1:47:55] winds blowed, he said, "Peace be still."
[1:47:58] And when there's a uh and when there was
[1:48:00] a tree, he said, "No man eat from thee.
[1:48:02] Verily I say unto you this these little
[1:48:05] gods, if you'll say to this mountain, be
[1:48:07] moved." Again, scripture we read, "And
[1:48:09] don't doubt in your heart, but believe
[1:48:10] that what you've said will come to pass,
[1:48:12] you can have whatsoever you've said."
[1:48:14] Amen. Go right back to Genesis original.
[1:48:17] What is it now? The world and nature is
[1:48:20] groaning, everything moving what? For
[1:48:22] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:48:25] When true sons, bore sons, fil sons
[1:48:28] speak and their word is backed. Amen.
[1:48:33] Your word is backed. Not backed by the
[1:48:37] government, but backed by heaven
[1:48:40] backed by God. I believe we're brother
[1:48:44] said, "I believe we're right on the
[1:48:45] border of it right now." Well, what did
[1:48:47] we go back to one of our very first
[1:48:48] messages in this adoption series? What
[1:48:51] did we learn about the waving of the
[1:48:52] sheath? Yeah. Amen. The first one to
[1:48:56] come to maturity. The first one in this
[1:48:58] last day. The first one to come to that
[1:49:01] place. The first one, not the only one.
[1:49:04] The first
[1:49:05] one. Brother Brown waved over the
[1:49:08] people. Brother Bram said, "What you
[1:49:10] seen in mine in the fullness of the
[1:49:13] bride, waving over the people." Praise
[1:49:16] the Lord. Thank God we still have videos
[1:49:19] we can watch. We have uh thousands of
[1:49:22] tapes we can listen to, right? Amen.
[1:49:25] Experiences go back on testimonies and
[1:49:27] things we know to be true. Books, tapes,
[1:49:33] testimonies. Oh, friend, it just it just
[1:49:37] baffles the
[1:49:39] mind. That is where we are today. Filled
[1:49:43] sons speak and their word is back. I
[1:49:45] believe we're on the border. He says
[1:49:46] now, yes, sir. Say this mountain, I'm a
[1:49:49] believer in Jesus Christ. I give it to
[1:49:52] you in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:49:54] There's a manifestation. Oh brother, my
[1:49:56] crops are burning up out yonder. I ain't
[1:49:58] had any rain. I'll send you rain in the
[1:50:00] name of the Lord. Amen. Praise the
[1:50:03] Lord. Oh, waiting, groaning, all nature
[1:50:06] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:50:08] sons of God. Where are we? Amen. Amen. I
[1:50:12] believe that's where we are. Yes. I sit
[1:50:14] down and think about it, friends. How
[1:50:16] many times even in the simple thing that
[1:50:18] that has happened? Yeah. Amen. I had one
[1:50:21] time
[1:50:24] that well maybe I shouldn't call names
[1:50:27] but
[1:50:30] that I was going to meet a brother I I I
[1:50:33] needed to talk to and hadn't seen for a
[1:50:36] little while and we were going to play
[1:50:39] golf together and the forecast was rain.
[1:50:44] Look around, rain
[1:50:46] everywhere. And I I ask the Lord. You
[1:50:49] say, "You spoke it. I asked the Lord
[1:50:52] that it it's it may rain over the entire
[1:50:55] city, but it's not going to rain where
[1:50:57] we are." Now, it didn't do that. It
[1:51:00] still rained, but it never rained or
[1:51:02] drop where we were. And I was able to
[1:51:04] meet with the brother, talk with him,
[1:51:06] and do the things that I mean, it's a
[1:51:08] whole backstory to it, but I'm just
[1:51:11] telling you the things that that the
[1:51:13] thing that happened simply because of
[1:51:16] the desire of my heart and and I believe
[1:51:18] the spiritual need that was there. Amen.
[1:51:22] And the Lord met that
[1:51:24] need.
[1:51:25] Speed here, I'm a farmer. My crops are
[1:51:29] drying up. I got no rain. Speak the
[1:51:32] rain. Yes. Rain come. Amen.
[1:51:37] Believe. We just got to have believe.
[1:51:39] Faith.
[1:51:41] Look at where we're living today. Amen.
[1:51:45] The earth is groaning. I didn't get to
[1:51:47] that part. The earth is groaning. Amen.
[1:51:51] I backgrounded a little bit, but didn't
[1:51:52] get to where I wanted to in the
[1:51:54] scripture. We'll do that next week,
[1:51:55] Lord. Well, well, next time, Lord
[1:51:57] willing. But we're at that place right
[1:52:00] now, saints. Yes. This this is who the
[1:52:03] bride is to be. This is who she should
[1:52:05] be today. Amen. And by the grace of God,
[1:52:09] just in the few nine years we've had
[1:52:11] this little church going, I've seen so
[1:52:13] many times that God has manifested it to
[1:52:15] us and your lives individually and to
[1:52:19] our lives individually and as a church
[1:52:22] as a whole, as a group. I I mean I I
[1:52:25] wish we had recorded for posterity every
[1:52:30] testimony we've gotten of answered
[1:52:32] prayers and things that God has done and
[1:52:35] moved just for us. Yes. I I it would it
[1:52:38] would be a lot. I just say that it would
[1:52:42] be a lot. Praise the Lord because that's
[1:52:46] who God is. That's what God's given us.
[1:52:48] That's who we are today. Amen. Praise
[1:52:51] the Lord. Let's stand if we could.
[1:52:54] I'm going to stop there
[1:52:57] and get to where the next part for next
[1:53:01] time. Amen. But for now, that that God
[1:53:05] has given us, we're looking
[1:53:08] to. It's our position. It's our
[1:53:13] place. Amen. By the grace of God. Amen.
[1:53:18] I'm so thankful he's given it as a
[1:53:21] promise of his word.
[1:53:24] Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:53:27] Jesus.
[1:53:31] Amen. Let's sing
[1:53:34] this verse. Sing it. Seems like I sing
[1:53:38] it quite a bit, but I was thinking of
[1:53:40] something that just keeps coming back to
[1:53:42] my
[1:53:43] mind.
[1:53:45] Amen. And of course, the Lord has me
[1:53:47] turn right to it first time. So 493 I
[1:53:51] want to
[1:53:52] live. Amen. Must be a reason
[1:53:59] then 493. We'll sing it. Amen. Get
[1:54:04] pulled up here. We'll have on the
[1:54:07] screen. Even though we probably sang it
[1:54:10] enough, everybody should know it. And
[1:54:13] our hearts desire to obey
[1:54:16] it. Amen. Let's sing it. I want to
[1:54:21] live the
[1:54:23] way he wants me to live. I want to
[1:54:31] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:54:39] I want to
[1:54:42] love love till there's just no more
[1:54:48] love. Oh, I could
[1:54:51] never ever out love my
[1:54:56] Lord. Oh, him now. I want to
[1:55:00] live the
[1:55:02] way he wants me to live. I want to
[1:55:10] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:55:18] I want to
[1:55:20] love love till there's just no more
[1:55:26] love. Oh, I could
[1:55:29] never ever out love. I'll this way one
[1:55:35] time now.
[1:55:37] I'm going to
[1:55:39] live the
[1:55:41] way Jesus wants me to live. I'm going to
[1:55:49] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:55:56] I'm going to
[1:56:00] love till there's just no more love. Oh,
[1:56:07] I could
[1:56:08] never ever out love my own.
[1:56:15] Yes, Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:56:19] Lord Jesus. It's all our desires to want
[1:56:22] to live the way he wants us to live.
[1:56:24] Amen. To be in that position. Because
[1:56:27] the one thing, in my opinion, that
[1:56:29] hinders our faith the most is when your
[1:56:32] heart condemns you. Yes. When your heart
[1:56:34] condemns you, it's hard to have
[1:56:36] confidence and faith towards God. Yes.
[1:56:39] Amen. But if you're in the right place,
[1:56:42] Amen. living the way that the scriptures
[1:56:45] tells, obey his word. Amen. That flow of
[1:56:50] faith is free. Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:56:54] Jesus. God bless you today. Pray
[1:56:56] something was said to bless and
[1:56:58] strengthen you in some way. Amen.
[1:57:00] Appreciate each one that's come and was
[1:57:02] with us this morning. Amen. I miss
[1:57:05] Shariah. Was she not feeling well?
[1:57:08] Amen.
[1:57:12] Amen. You feeling better?
[1:57:14] Your back's feeling better? Yes.
[1:57:18] Thankful for that.
[1:57:21] So, God bless you richly. Remember, we
[1:57:24] will not have another service here until
[1:57:26] June 8th. Amen. June 8th will be the
[1:57:30] next service that we have here. The next
[1:57:31] two services, me and my wife will be out
[1:57:33] of town. Uh so again, we do appreciate
[1:57:36] your prayers very much for that. Uh June
[1:57:39] 8th will be a travel day for me, but the
[1:57:42] way he has me scheduled right now, I
[1:57:44] should not have to change uh service
[1:57:47] times. So Lord willing, our next
[1:57:50] service, June 8th, will be at our
[1:57:52] regular 10:30 time. Supposed to go to
[1:57:55] California and uh there's a
[1:57:58] a little later. So, shouldn't have to
[1:58:00] worry about that. If anything changes or
[1:58:02] anything, of course, I'll let you know
[1:58:04] that as of right now, June 8th, that'll
[1:58:06] be our next service and u we'll have our
[1:58:10] regular 10:30 time. So, so Lord richly
[1:58:14] bless you. Uh we could pray about the
[1:58:17] Lord's will of uh it would come. I I I
[1:58:22] can't it just doesn't leave my mind. I
[1:58:24] really would like to get that place next
[1:58:25] door. I wish we could afford it. um
[1:58:28] because it it would help things in here.
[1:58:32] We we wouldn't have to go outside to go
[1:58:34] to the bathrooms. It would just be in
[1:58:36] the back door there. Uh open open up the
[1:58:39] wall right here for us to come through
[1:58:41] for I'd leave this all the same and just
[1:58:43] make that the vest field out there and
[1:58:45] lock that door uh and put that as the
[1:58:48] entrance up there and have that for
[1:58:50] fellowship and
[1:58:53] uh a room for gathering or dinners or uh
[1:58:57] bathroom. And anyway, so we'll see. Uh,
[1:59:01] whatever the Lord wants, that's what
[1:59:03] matters the most. I'm happy with what we
[1:59:04] got. Not complaining,
[1:59:07] but maybe that's just my human ambition,
[1:59:12] my human desire. Amen. But thankful for
[1:59:15] what the go for what the Lord has done
[1:59:16] for us. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, God
[1:59:19] richly bless you. Appreciate your
[1:59:21] prayers uh as me and my wife go out of
[1:59:24] town and uh appreciate the Lord keeping
[1:59:26] safe and healthy. God bless you. Does

[1:59:45] anyway. So, thank you for bringing it
