to go the lord in prayers start the service now and take up the prayer requests that's been sent to me here obviously you all know about and i made you aware of it if you haven't been made aware of uh but the joel mourinho uh senior uh passed away thursday uh we had prayer requests for him and he'd been in the hospital with covet the whole family had come down with it joel jr was in the hospital for a little while uh he's out doing better i hear in the family but uh sister crystal joel jr isabelle really needs the lord in their hands on their side right now and just trust the lord bless them and be with them and comfort them and help during this time they need to have finances to be able to live they need to have finance to be able to take care of arrangements for joel senior and everything that goes with it so please remember that in prayer joel was only 39 i believe um but he did have some underlying conditions but he's gone to his reward now but please remember the family

brother joel's past and the lord is superior and knows all things so yes sovereign and does is he will so whatever the purpose the lord had for this would just trust that it'd be manifest and uh just trust his perfect will in it and know that he has something uh special for that family in this in this time of grieving uh also uh sister tabitha asked for a special unspoken request for her uh sister norma had asked a request for her daughter kathy she's been having some awful pain in her stomach she thinks maybe and i don't know if it's been diagnosed as appendicitis but doctors can't figure out what's going on her stomach's expanded and really needs our prayers so she's in a lot of pain remember kathy's sister enormous daughter in prayer the lord would just intervene there too senior member uh leah dennis's wife he also asked for uh you know the obvious there her the doctor's office and things going on there uh they also asked a prayer request for her friend peach as we have mentioned

asking today believing because we know that you knew these requests before they ever became requests but lord you yet asked us to ask and we ask believing lord we don't want to ask a miss either we want to ask believing that you hear you know these requests and you honor our faith and our faith to believe that god you're going to move upon each one of that your hand is going to be on them to bless them and to touch and help and make a way where there seem to be no way in every situation father we're very needful today god we're in a very dark hour this world is in a very dark hour lord we

may we play our part in it lord as we commit it to you and ask these blessings in these requests in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you today amen again welcome to our streaming service as you all know or as those most of you would know uh that we've been on the topic of the mysteries of god in christ uh we've been through part eight last week and of course we went through like four parts five parts i forget of god revealing himself to his people remember these three parts that we're going into now that brother brannan brought to us in christ the mystery of god revealed and the first thing was that god could reveal himself to his people and condemn sinned down from his almighty omnipotence into a way that we could receive him and he could come and live in us and and that second part of that now that we're getting into that we want to start today we'll start today maybe hit some of the highlights and get some of the foundation laid to really get into some of it lord willing the next couple of weeks but the next part of part two is god having the preeminence in his people and his bride uh you know the bible says that jesus came to uh to save his people uh and i believe that his people are here to be uh to do his will and to do his purpose and to do his bidding and that's the purpose of the preeminence that god put himself in our lives so this is uh god having the preeminence in his people this will be part one but this is the mysteries of god in christ part nine so as we go to the bible again we'll go back to revelation 10 7. read this as we understand this to be a latter day a scripture for us to read and was fulfilled or is being fulfilled through the prophet revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so we see in amos that the lord god surely does nothing except he revealed to his servants the prophets we see revelation 10 7 that this mystery would be finished that mystery that would be finished as he declared past tense to his servants prophets he'll do nothing less revealed to his prophet so that prophet then brings that word to a people that god could then reveal it to them we can't go on the misnomer which unfortunately seems a lot of people do that because brother branham preached something it's revealed it's only revealed to you when god reveals it to you now i believe that brother branham preached the truth and the revelation of it but it takes god to come and reveal it just because you've listened to a tape or read a book or got some kind of an understanding doesn't mean god's revealed something to you so that revelation is that in product of god showing himself to you see that three-step process of of uh repent be baptized and receive in the holy spirit uh that holy spirit brings us into that relationship and communion fellowship with the lord jesus talked a little bit about last week that we come into that fellowship in communion with the lord that god revealed himself to us well the prophets bring that truth that truth comes to us because remember faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god so that word comes and we hear it but we don't just hear it with our ear those that receive the revelation it comes into our spirit into our soul and god reveals it to us in there what he'd have us to see and know it says things in the scripture we know that god just doesn't come out and say x y z black white god reveals it to his people god unfolds it god has mysteries in the bible how many times have been talked about mysteries through the scripture and mysteries being revealed this is just one of them but again this part here of the mystery of god now again we want to reiterate that mystery is jesus christ and who he is the godhead of god not some trinity not some second person the truth of the godhead and jesus in that godhead the son of god and god revealing himself the only way that god conned and sent down to live in us to bring a kinsmen redeemer so that it would bring the perfect sacrifice of kinmanship to annihilate sin away from us not just to cover it but to completely annihilate sin and to do away with it jesus come to take our place so that we could take his place so that we could be robed in his righteousness the word and that we would have no spot wrinkle or blemish there is no spot if you have your garment on it's got spots it's got wrinkles and blemishes if i have my garment it's all spotted wrinkled and blemished but if we have his garment this garment the word garment then that garment is without spot it's without wrinkle it's without blemish that's the purpose god having preeminence in his children now i want to read the scripture brother branham read and of course the one place that is in the new testament that brings this word to life so let's go to colossians i'm going to read the first chapter same place we had read in god unfolding himself because again i've mentioned this to you before that there's things that are all that overlap there's things that uh that bring the complete revelation of something and sometimes you hit that in those in in that series and in that part but it actually lats over into another part which then will lap over into another part which we'll do here um the second part of god having preeminence laughs right over into god restoring that kingdom back to his children amen because it couldn't have been restored unless that uh couldn't that kingdom had couldn't have been restored unless his children had received the preeminence of him so it every bit goes together but we read this scripture want to read it again we got into the preeminence and told you when we get back to this that we will read it in that part as well so we're starting first colossians chapter 1 verse 12. colossians chapter 1 verse 12. giving thanks unto the father which i hope that background there a little bit kind of helps refresh things to you but let's go on giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light the inheritance of the saints i understand what is that inheritancy uh we might not get into the inheritance part today but that all plays a part in understanding who we are and that preeminence of christ in us see who hath delivered us this is beautiful see now who had delivered us from the power of darkness satan who's delivered us from satan's eden who has delivered us from all the devices of satan who has delivered us from all the diseases and the germs and the afflictions of satan can you say amen praise the lord delivered us what a time we live friend see delivered us from the power of darkness covet is a power of darkness that god has delivered us from amen and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now that translated means he has placed us from one place to another he has taken us from this place the born and sin shaped naked become the world speaking lives into a place of the light of the gospel of jesus christ or as he said here inheritance of the saint into the kingdom of his dear son praise the lord into that kingdom so we've been transferred from the power of darkness from this dark world into the light of jesus christ into the kingdom which we may probably read this scripture again when we get into the restoration of the kingdom and the kingdom of his dear son so where does his children where does god people set today you know we're earthly beings of course in this body but where do we sit you go back and read ephesians 2 it tells us that we are sitting in heavenly places in christ brother brown tells us that heavenly places is knowing your place in christ or the adoption the placement of god putting us in that body where we belong see that kingdom where we belong in a body there's every part that has to play we'll get into the body when we might get to the body today that body every part of it has a part to play in the body the ear has a part the eye has a part the toe has a part the finger has a part every every bit of the body has a part see and they all have their part to play and they're all important see they're all important so they all have that part when there's a kingdom you think about a king a king or a queen and a kingdom that king has uh a servants or that kingdom has has parts that get played in that kingdom see there there's there's different things there's there's cooks and there's servants there's people that watch after there's guards there's there's there's all the parts that have to be played see so that placement now is just it's just the simple father understanding of the adoption of god putting us in the body in his body in the kingdom of his dear son in whom in whom who his son jesus christ in whom we have redemption through his blood amen through his blood even the forgiveness of sins the blood now what was that blood that wasn't the blood of joseph it wasn't the blood of mary it wasn't the hemoglobin of a human it was the blood of god it was god's blood it was the blood of god coursing through the veins of his son jesus christ so that when that blood was shed the power of that blood to break the blood cell down to release god back to the people again to release that spirit to release god almighty jesus christ coming back into his children not just an anointing not just a spirit that falls on the people but an actual indwelling an actual spirit an actual literal jesus christ coming into the believer see it has to be that through that blood so he's redeemed us already talked about that redeemed from the power of darkness and translated or moved us from that power of satan's eden and darkness into the kingdom of his dear son now we've been placed in that kingdom play the part that god give us by the redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin the forgiveness of sin no longer covering of sin but a forgiveness of sin an annihilation of sin blessed is the man to whom god does not impute sin god does not hold accountable that sin praise the lord so that's the that's the fulfillment of god allowing bringing that to pass in our lives the blood the forgiveness of sins who is jesus the image of the invisible god or the expression jesus we said that we went through that now the expression of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and within earth visible invisible whether it be thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him again we described that went through that with god unfolding himself to his people revealing himself to his people see and he is jesus is before all things and by him all things stand i know it says consist you look in the greek same thing stand all those things stand today by the word of god by the power of god by the power of the spoken word through faith those things stand today just like they did when they were created amen and he is now listen we get to this now he is jesus is the head of the body the church the bride amen not a nominal church not just a church nominal or a church just uh uh that that believe on uh the the the things that are of the nominal world or the church world will just say the church world christendom would you say but a bride a bride a bride that god has that god has called to be his wife that god literally took out of the sight of jesus christ and the feminist into her to become the bride to jesus christ he is the head of that body the church who is the beginning again we go back to revelation 3 14 the beginning of the creation of god the firstborn from the dead that in all things he jesus might have the preeminence now remember what is this mystery of god this mystery that contains all the mysteries is jesus christ amen jesus christ that in all things amen all things he jesus might have the preeminence now that's only one place in the new testament that word is used preeminence you go and look in the greek it explains what it is very short detail because it's somewhat explained self-explanatory although we'll go into it in just a minute but it's the only place in the new testament that that is referred to or the only place in the greek that it's even referenced is that word right there preeminence all things he jesus might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him jesus should all the fullness dwell all the fullness of what not the fullness of me or you but the fullness of the godhead god almighty the fullness of the godhead dwelling in him amen once he was in moses once he was in enoch once he was in uh noah once he was in the different ones paul and down through the ages brother ham once he was in but through jesus christ he's come in the fullness the fullness of the godhead in jesus christ in him who is the head of the body and has the preeminence in all things all things now remember our topic here our topic or our sub topic if you will is having the preeminence in his believers in his people god having the preeminence in his bride see that's the whole thing here uh let me just read it to you can we just read it here out of christ the mystery of god revealed remember the first purpose now first purpose was that god wanted to reveal himself to his people amen right here christ in mystery god revealed secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers amen that is his bride his bride his believers his bride secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in his people now he could do that adam and eve but sin separated them so now there's a way to get back oh my he said let's talk about getting rich now see that second part though to have that preeminence in his body of believers so remember again the subtitle the subtopic we have here god having the preeminence in his body of believers so let's look at that word for a moment since it's only once in the new testament let's just look at it because it's not a word that people on an everyday basis usually use uh i i don't use it um but it it ha it's it's a root word and a prefix and you see the prefix is literally the word pre uh pre eminence we may know the the the two together the the two separate but the two together what they make up and the understanding of the definition of it um you would use let's just look at this pre the the prefix pre is to mean earlier prior to or before prior to earlier or before pre means before so if it's before then who was that that is before not just putting something uh to say before something else no no he was before period not a before this or before this time or before that no he is the before he's the alpha the beginning see alpha omega beginning ending he is the alpha so that beginning that pre we would say is the before we always say beginning he never had a beginning elo himself existing so he had never had a beginning but this is this pre is before so he's before all things by him all things consist and in all things he is to have the preeminence pre before amen so he's free now eminence is famed famed or recognized superiority famed which is you know broadly knowledged among people famed or recognized superiority in other words someone that is superior to you or someone who is superior to everyone else or someone who is superior to everything all things botany life animal life human life superior that's what this is fame will recognize superiority now you've probably heard the phrase and uh you've probably heard it used you probably never used it but people use the phrase when they get to someone like a king or even the pope they say your eminence or even someone even a cardinal or something in the catholic church something someone of a hierarchy in that church would would refer to that person as your imminence even if it's a higher position in a local church there catholic church they would refer to that person as your imminence see your imminence or someone who's feigned uh recognized superiority you are superior to me and that eminence is placing that person in a position that's above the rest of the people see that's why we never use that word that's why that word doesn't exist in our vocabulary especially when it comes to church because there is no such thing as imminence or your imminence the only imminent one that has imminence over or superiority over is god no no minister no pastor no preacher i don't care how well known he is i don't care how big his church is or how much money they get in there is no one that is over or above or superior to the other we are all a part of this in together as the body of christ amen as the body of christ he's the head we're the body remember the head he's the we just read him being the head he's the head we're the body so that body has its own position in place now you say well take the heart out you die and cut the peeky off and live that is true but the pinky plays a very important role god wouldn't put it there the pinky toe or or whatever part of the body it might be every bit of it but that doesn't mean that the that the heart is more imminent than the toe the toes part of the body just like the heart is just like any other vital organ the liver or whatever lungs their vital organs are called vital because we need them to live but we don't need the pinky toe to lift but it's still a part of the body it's not a lesser part of the body it's just much a part of the body let's just say this without the pinky toe yeah you can live but is your body complete body's not complete without the pinky toe it's not complete without the pinky finger and we're not jesus christ isn't coming for a deformed body so how important is it that the pinky toe be the pinky toe and be right where it is to serve its purpose it's just as important as anything because if god's coming back for this body he's coming back for an entire complete body one complete unit not something that's deformed not something that's missing this that or the other no so that makes so if the pinky's not there where it's supposed to be he's not coming to get the body so now how important is it it's it's of the most important so there's no imminence there's no one that has the superiority but you hear that word you may have heard it or used as your imminence before there's no your imminence but if you look at the word imminence and you see the superiority part you understand there's one that is superior and that is god god is the only superior one so when you put preeminence together as this word is it says before superiority he is before all things and he is superior to all things and in that god will have number one place or not at all in all things he is to have humanists animal life bought me life now human life we have a soul so we have a choice we have a decision we decide animal life doesn't body life doesn't they are just what they are as god has created them but humans we have thinking we have expression we have free will we have decision making and our decisions shape who we are and what we are so that decision that we choose him as our preeminence makes the difference in what god is looking for god's not looking for the body life that just obeys him and does whatever he says with the animal life but he's looking for someone of their own free will god wants someone of their own desire of their own free will of their own choosing to choose him as their preeminent superiority over them and anything else in the world or anybody else in the world he is number one he's going to be number one before all things superior to all things he is the preeminent notice preeminence if you want to look it up in the greek now together is superiority or to be first preeminence to be first or hold now i like the way this was worded so listen this real close at first i thought well that's a strange way to say that but then when i said it a couple of times to myself i thought that's perfect and what it says is hold the first place that sounded strange to me at first you think well hold the whole first place you think well they hold first place now hold the first place you say it a couple of times or as my expressiveness come to you you can see what a difference that makes with that little three letter v in there it says hold the first place i even put it in uh higher case letters so that it stand out even to me as i'm reading this to you hold the first place so you understand there's not a this person's first this person's first note he holds the first place in your life that's the preeminence in all things he to have that preeminence that the first place not a first place the first place because without that and everything else is is uh subject to that everything else is below that he is before superior and has the preeminence as the head the head of the body the preeminence in the bride now that's where god wants to be that's where god's going to be in the bride because that's the only place that he's going to be see is that preeminent that first place i don't believe honestly that if if you know we're baptized and baptism is good we need to be baptized that's fine but that doesn't save you baptism does not save you but when that's just showing the world and your expression to the world and to god that you've accepted him as your savior as your personal savior that's you say i choose you lord but see the heart has to be right that's just an action that you can do see if if the repentance isn't sincere and if your heart is not in the right place to have him first then you're just going down a drive center and coming up a wet one it's not making any difference but see once that preeminence in your heart is coming god recognizes that not just by baptism but he recognizes that by you and your life and your spirit and and your heart because god judges the man by the heart so when he sees that heart and he recognizes that preeminent position that you put him in in your life that to me is when that spirit comes and lives in you that's when you are born again that's when the person of jesus christ comes and sets your soul is his residence at that time because god knows god knows your heart not just because of an outward expression that's just a part of it not because of that but because in your heart you've made that decision or that placement that you're going to put god first in everything in everything of your life and everything about you he is going to have the preeminence amen how many places in the bible jesus talks about unless you neglect father mother sister brother family all this and take up your cross and follow me you're not worthy to be called my disciple because she's gonna have preeminence now that's not to say that you're gonna hate your mom or daddy literally hate them or your wife your spouse or your brother sister siblings whatever no he's not saying that but he's saying he's gonna be first or he's not gonna be at all see that's the preeminence now that preeminence is there so that god could then begin to express himself in ways that he never was able to do through the generations of time from the time in the garden of eden and we can we could go right back to the garden of eden now and you go right back to the garden of eden and you see the preeminence that god had in adam the preeminence that god had in all nature in the body life and animal life all nature because remember it's going to be all things not just the bride but in all things because all the fullness of the godhead dwell in him in jesus christ so when you go back to that and you see that expression that god had now jesus came as the expression of the invisible god but he came that way because fall in the garden of eden there hadn't been never been a fall that expression would have continued to unfold and exist in each one of us through adam down through the spoken word being of god's creation of his people upon this planet to live in the harmony and the perfection that god created the garden of eden that was god's purpose that was his plan that's the way it was supposed to be but see when paul entered in and sin entered in the camp then there had to be a substitute there had to be a a way to circumvent that and come back around to where god can begin to then express himself in the way that he had intended through down to the generations of time now you can see in the scripture if god reveals his word to you you can see in the scripture we've gone through some of it and you can you can find those pockets of things in there where god expressed himself the best he could to those men and women of those of that day but it could not be any fullness until jesus christ come god in the womb of a woman to express himself through that one man to where he can place his entirety of the godhead into that one jesus christ not a second person of a trinity but the almighty almighty god you want to question whether he was the almighty god go ask isaiah 9 and see if he tells you whether he's almighty god see the scriptures got to run in perfect continuity all that had to come together so now he can have the preeminence and live in his people to express that so the expression of that could come forth now there was a time see when when when we know and i've read the quote i won't read it again today where where brother brown talks about when eve left her mate adam she left the word when she left the words she got in trouble she got into the place that she could be uh manipulated and she could get to to begin to doubt and when that when that doubt came in and she fell into that doubt and then she of course brought her husband in which uh which he partook of again expressing the life of christ going to get his bride going into sin to get his bride then that creation that god had created there fell now not just adam and evil but all of creation fell why because adam was a minor amateur god of this earth he could speak names say he could do whatever he wanted to do see so if he was in control of this and by him the head at that time of this world fell then everything under him fell oh my just think about that i read something this morning let me just give you this little tidbit i read something this morning and it was outstanding i thought of it from time to time but never expressed to me quite in this way but uh someone had said um someone had said or i read it they said you know years and years ago and it's been many years i didn't research it or have time to look it up but many years ago they took bible and prayer out of our schools many years ago i don't know 50 60 70 i don't remember how it's been a long time and you know back in the day and even as i was coming up as a young man they begin to say and talk among themselves and christians begin to question what is going to become of our nation now what is going to happen to our youth how is our educational system going to come forth now now that god has been rejected out of our children's lives in education what's going to happen to this country well i think we can look up today and look at everything that's going on and get the answer they might not have known 50 60 70 years ago whenever it was and when they took it out what was going to happen but you can look at this nation today and you can find out and see exactly what has happened see when that one thing was removed everything else crumbled beneath it because it had no foundation it had no stability it had nothing to hold it then when adam fell everything else fell with it everything else come into that same fallen condition it was never a a lion never ate a an animal or a lamb or something those things didn't happen they loved each other the the the lion and the lamb laid down together but see when the fall came then then all that went with it everything else fell with it see it was that one thing but now when she but let's get back to this point when she the woman left adam she left her mate she left the word when she left the word that's when she fell now he talked about you know the church denomination or when you leave the word you lead jesus christ you leave jesus christ the word then your foundation is gone that's what happened to even that's what happened in the beginning but i want you to understand something now that this eve this second eve this bride this last day when she has come up and risen up to the point that she not only uh is the bride of jesus christ as eve was the bride to adam but she has literally because of christ's coming and the condescension of him revealing himself to his people coming and having the preeminence in her she is now cannot fall she cannot leave the word because she has become the word she has become the word because she was literally taken from the side of jesus christ who is the word and now lives in her the word so now she is the word and she cannot fall from the word because that's who she is so this bride this last day will accomplish and become and be the expression that jesus christ through him that god has always wanted to express because of the preeminence that god has in her she the word that expression is now expressing through her through her god manifesting himself through her friend if we can't understand see the part that we play of what god's doing in this last day that we really need to be born again well we really need a revelation of this word of of this word in us and who we are in it remember we read philippians last week chapter 2 that god morphed himself god changing his mask god plain from one part to the next part to the next part but the same god all the time well what do you think he does to us see that form of changing that form of putting on a different mass just helps us evolve into the place that we're at and who we understand that he took upon himself the form of a servant who are we that we morph from the person that we were what we were born as into the glorious light of jesus christ in the kingdom of god in his kingdom we read saint john chapter 1 verse 12 or 14 that that we that he is give us the power to become sons and daughters of god why did he give us the power to become sons and daughters of god so he could have the preeminence in us to have the first place in us to come and live in us so that he could express himself through us to the rest of this world amen through the rest to the rest of this world that's what our prayer that's a part of the purpose that we have here our only purpose is to express jesus christ how can you express jesus christ if you don't know who jesus christ is that's why he is the mysteries or the mystery of god that is finished because in him is the expression of those mysteries the word that come forth the word that literally uh expresses itself through the body of believers today called lebron that's who we are in him we are that bride look here now christ the mystery of god revealed he said where once we mention this briefly see he said now where once moses had him partly david had him but here amen here as we express him today to you and as we see in the word he is manifested in the fullness praise the lord how could he express himself in the fullness being only a part of that trinity can't do it so what have you done now if you believe there's three gods you've completely taken the bible out of context it doesn't work anymore because for him to have the fullness he has to be the fullness and for him to be the fullness he has to be god because god is the fullness if you only have part of him here or part of him here a part of him here or he's part of him is in the holy ghost or part of him is in the father or part of then then you just chop god up and there's no where does that fullness come the fullness comes because he's one jesus christ the fullness he is manifested in the fullness deity himself standing on the earth god in his fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring to his church a sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church his bride to manifest listen now to manifest is our part he's talking about us here now so listen to what he who what we're doing now to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for these last days who is he doing it through you say oh brother branham yeah yeah it it part of it came through brother brandon brother brown did his part brother bannon was adopted into the family and he did exactly the part that god told him to do when he was done god took him what about your part do you not think your part is as important as brother brown's part do you not think you're as important in the body of christ as he is do you not think in the sonship of jesus christ you mean as much to god as brother branham did well if you don't think you do friend then you again you need a revelation because that's just the part of it the fullness of that is in the body of believers the bride we are all a part of the body we all make up the body brother adam is a part of that body he makes up a part of that body just like you make up a part of that body and god is here to have and manifest to have the fullness to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for these last days praise the lord god using his bride revealing through his bride who he is so that in this last day he manifests himself see he i hope you see now world these mysteries of plural are the mysteries remember our title is the mysteries of god in christ they're in christ i hope you see now for these mysteries plural come from not just revelation 10 7 the mystery of god the mystery of god finished jesus christ in jesus christ is these mysteries oh i hope that helps us understand now and and the placement of who we are in that let's read this description here real quick just two just two uh verses we'll close here in just a minute but colossians chapter two now so i have to go far we're just in colossians one go to colossians 2. we already read colossians 1 uh 19 it said for it please the father that in him christ should all fullness dwell in colossians 2 9 it says for in him jesus christ dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily now again i've told you before i love that word all it's all inclusive it's it it covers every bit of it all means all it doesn't mean that the little piece is hanging out here or a little part out here that's not or something like that not all is all if it's all it's all it means everything so every bit of the godhead bodily was in jesus christ all the fullness all the fullness of the godhead bodily now look what the tenth verse says though now and you ye are complete in him i'll praise the lord which is the head of all principality and power now what is complete what does it mean to be complete when something's complete let's you know this just kind of my mind my mom used to love doing puzzles and you know she put those puzzles together and i mean she can do thousands of pieces of puzzle and put that puzzle together and as you're doing the puzzle the picture starts coming clearer and clearer and you can look at the box but you're not really something when you look at the box but when that puzzle because piece by piece you're putting it together and as you put each piece in it becomes clearer and clearer and you look at it you think mine is looking more and more like the box it's looking more more like the picture on the box and and you keep putting pieces in you keep putting pieces in and pretty soon you put that last piece in and it completes the entire picture the entire picture then comes in plain view because you took every piece and you place it in together now the picture is complete if you're missing one piece the picture's not complete i mean there might be a little bird in that in that piece you're missing there might be a little tractor or there might be a a some food or something on a table there might be some very important in that one piece so you understand it might just be a leaf but the picture is not complete until every single piece is in its place and when every piece is in its place it's complete well if you take that word complete and and and you go back to understanding when when jesus talks about us being perfect he doesn't mean sinless but he means complete he means a full age grown up mature or again complete well how are we complete we're complete because we are in him let me read it again ye are complete in him amen not just him and me but me in him i'm complete in him which is the head again the head of all principality and power all things he has the preeminence in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and now we are complete we are complete in him the picture has been filled the last piece has been placed the puzzle now matches the picture the vision has now come into plain view and you can see what it was meant to be the whole time now i set up my lighting in here so there's no shadowing so it's pretty hard to do hers understand this but if you got a shadow and you come closer and closer you can see where the light comes in and when the shadow you just look and see well that's just a shadow you don't know for sure but you think it looks like a hand but the closer you get to it the more it comes into plain view then you realize wow that is a hand or when the picture when the picture comes into plain view and it's complete then you can see what it really is and what it really is is nothing more than him it's nothing more than him it's us in him the only way it can be that way is if he has the preeminence in us he lives in us he has a rule and reign over our lives one more point i want to make uh maybe i read this scripture or this quote uh here i had one more quote i was going to read um but we'll see how did you really get to that part we'll do that next time lord willing but i want to take one more moment because people today churches are full people call themselves christians the word christian the the office or the the denotation or designation of christian is used very widely today a lot of people claim to be christians and i'm not going to claim their experiences wrong that's their experience that's up to them if they if they are really christians and it'll bear itself out that there will really be christians but it's it's quite a word that's being used but when when we accept let's look at this a minute we'll go back to the imminence preeminence superiority when you think about someone having superiority over you when you think about there being uh god will say the the deity the almighty the omnipotent the elohim superiority preeminence over body believers that places that body of believers in a certain position that position i believe is the place where brother branham said this project gets to understand that that this rapture will take place don't think with that far away from that uh sometimes it looks like we're a million miles from it but the truth of it is i believe we're very close to that we see time winding up as we see things happening but nevertheless but the thing is not just to say i'm a christian it's not just to say i've accepted jesus as my savior when you say that you've accepted jesus as your savior there's a word that a lot of times people don't bring into that that helps understand what that means and that word is l-o-r-d lord he is our lord and savior he's not just our savior people say well i accept him as my savior that's fine but is he your lord see a bigger thing in life is not just saying he's my savior but is he your lord if he's your lord then that means he has preeminence over you that means he is lord over you he is lord over your life he is lord over your direction over your actions over everything you do say where you go everything about you that's why god calls and demands for holiness from his children because he is our lord he lords over us amen he's our lord if he's not your lord then he's not anything to you amen you say he's my savior but he's not going to be your savior unless he is your lord unless he has that preeminence unless he has that first place he's not going to be your lord and people walk around and live and act and do any way they want to and say that he's their lord disobey the word live act and dress up in indifference to god's word and say he's your lord talk and go places and do things that that's that you know is just pleasing or you don't realize it maybe but is against god's word if that's the truth and he's not your lord if he's your lord then every part of this is who you are you are because remember we are the word you are the word every part of that has become you and every part of you wants to obey that and every bit of that that you obey shows that he's your lord because you obey him you obey his word you obey everything about it because he's your lord he's over you he is your owner he is your ruler he is your lord so he's not just savior friend he is my lord and savior he's my lord i'm gonna live by the dictates of his word his word tells me his word tells me right here what that is his word come to a prophet for this last day bringing about that word that places us the bride in its position to understand who she is that he is our lord amen he is our lord and savior praise the lord so i will stop there but lord willing uh we'll see what happens next week the lord willing we'll get on to the next part of this if god will terry we're still here and we have the opportunity god will bless us in it maybe it'll be in our church maybe it won't at this point uh friend like i said we have uh several things still to do on the church uh we got to run we got to do the electricity uh the lights the air i
