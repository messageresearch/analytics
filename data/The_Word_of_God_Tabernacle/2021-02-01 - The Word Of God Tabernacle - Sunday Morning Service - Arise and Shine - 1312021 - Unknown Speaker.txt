needs this morning brother dennis would you mind praying over these knees please lord jesus we bow our hearts and our heads before you the mighty conqueror the king of kings the lord of lords what a privilege to know you in power and demonstration of your word and of your truth lord knowing that the world has fallen apart as our brother prayed already the bible your word is being fulfilled before our very eyes oh lord many are running to and fro not knowing where they're going not knowing what they need to do they're so fearful of all the conditions that's around him but father we have a rock that's you father jesus christ we have a rest at you lord we have a peace we have an understanding we we know by your grace you have called us to serve you and to walk in the light of the revelation of your word for this hour and father as i heard your prophet say earlier this week there is a promised land for the believer today and that's the message of the hour and lord we come believing that we are not defeated we are mourning conquerors in your name and there are some that need a healing touch lord that without you coming on the scene there's no hope man cannot do anything but we know that you are our great physician that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and by your stripes we are healed it's a finished work you are already uh acquired for us at calvary and we ask you to minister to each and every one sister shelia and sister little sister and the other ones that have been expressed this morning and lord i believe there's people reaching out to you in an unspoken way their hearts are reaching out to you may you come on the scene and minister to each one are joy unspeakable and full of glory will will be running with faith and praise knowing that we serve a living god and lord bless the remainder of the service bless our pastor as he ministers your word use him as a vest out of the way that you may speak through him the word of life that we have need of this day and open our hearts father this is not an hour to be complacent to be lackadaisical but father may your word just do the work it's been sent to do to bring us in the stature of a perfect man lord don't let us fall asleep you know we can come to church and maybe have a good nap and that won't do us any good but father wake us up in this late hour father help us to be more sincere to live our life for others to let our love um be expressed one towards another and above all towards you and your word granted lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen now you maybe see it if you want as well and then there were no uh testimonies written down in the back there but does anyone have a testimony or a song special they want to share at this time since did you yeah yes i actually have two so i want to thank you all i know back over the summer you were praying for my arm and i had about a month and a half out where i had to wait to go get an ultrasound done on it and so it you know i'm dealing with the pain and just where it gets so bad i would cry at night and i went and had the ultrasound done and it came back and they said oh well we can't find anything what do you mean you can't find anything i can feel the lump right here in my arm and so i was just really upset about it and just kind of angry you know and within a few days after that i was i i came across a video where they were doing um from a medical perspective on the crucifixion and i just broke down and i said nope every one of those stripes amen it was for me and my healing and i just started using my arm and so i was able to put my hair in a ponytail this morning um i can't fully raise it but i mean i couldn't do this you know the pain isn't what it was and so i just thank him so much for that and then the second one brother newton said on a textbook my niece was baptized yesterday in the name of the lord jesus christ bless brother tom for his pool for being there and you know he just the lord's really dealing with her heart um so if you could please just continue i appreciate all the prayers last night but if he continues to keep her and my sister

[Music] amen great advice amen praise the lord the best advice we can get you know a lot of us take things to the lord the hardest part seems like people have is leaving right there amen i always want to be so in control of everything and we want to be able to have to do it ourselves but you know friend christ has already done it amen take him out and leave it it's already done amen praise the lord you can't wash your sins away nor can you heal yourself nor can you relieve yourself of your burdens just take them to jesus amen amen he is the way the truth to life and he will take them from you if you trust and believe in him amen praise the lord god bless you today welcome to the house of the lord welcome those of you may be streaming appreciate you being here and supporting and uh just trust the lord visit uh with us again today and as sister julie had mentioned the baptism went real well yesterday i thought very well water was quite cold i told a few including brother thomas said well i've used to baptize the tabernacle and that water was very cold this water was colder it was colder in rotterdam's pool than it was at the tabernacle that's about as cool as i have baptized anybody although i saw them break the ice in the river in north carolina to baptize my sister so wow when you want to get baptized you don't care how cold it is and if somebody wants to get baptized i don't care how cold it is so but we didn't do a lot of conversation we didn't do a lot of prayer we just got in the pool baptized and got out we come we conversed and and prayed outside the pool which uh which kind of worked very well uh enjoyed the fellowship too very much we sat around afterwards and talked and sat down by the pool with brother tom and it was a real blessing i think since julie set the sun a little too long but but it was a real blessing and i appreciate it enjoyed it and thank you so much for your prayers and continued prayers uh for maggie and uh of course sister julie's been claiming her family friend you notice that god is moving in your families yeah i've noticed i get a little bit here a little bit there for this one that one and the other but the lord is moving in our families and i pray for you all and for them all the time yes and i put them in the hands of the lord and trust and believe for salvation uh for each of them so i i believe it's it it a little bit at a time whatever god would do so it was a real honor to be able to baptize maggie yesterday and i believe god was with us so amen and again i appreciate your prayers so i'm thankful to be here today lord give us another beautiful day in tucson amen so let's stand to our feet if we could and we'll look in our bibles to isaiah i thought it came on my heart several weeks ago that i felt like i wanted to bring and of course with the being at home and streaming those couple of weeks i put this off just like i put last week's off a little bit it seems like each thought that the lord gives me kind of runs in continuity and kind of joins together a little bit even though there's some different scripture and different title and things like that they just they kind of dovetail so but i think that's kind of what everything's happening today anyway you see the world uniting and the world council uniting and all the churches all that they're all coming together you know but brother branham told us it's uniting time for the bride right what did he say uniting time and sign amen so that all dovetails together so it's gonna dovetail you man i've had brother john and different ones tell me uh so and so spoke on this and so and so said that and i said i have no idea but you know it doesn't matter because god's in control of it and god's in control of it then it all fits perfect the way it's supposed to so amen so isaiah chapter 60. i'm gonna read the first few verses but before we do let's bow our heads again for another word of prayer precious jesus father it is an honor and a privilege to be here lord once again in your house thank you for all that you've done for us through the week thanking you for the desire and the time the ability to be here today lord for this service god that you've given us we don't know how many more of these that we're going to have lord even brother branham said we may not even have a meet like this ever again we don't know lord but we're thankful god that regardless of what does happen and what tomorrow brings we know who holds tomorrow we know who holds next week if there is next month next year and god would just want to follow your leading and do what you would call for us to do each one in our lives be led by your spirit lord because that's all that matters to us in life we are sheep to the shepherd we have relinquished our rights we have relinquished our desires we have relinquished our will and our desires and our will and our purpose in life is only to serve you and to live for you and everything that you give us to do sometimes it means we just go about our daily business and we just live our lives sometimes it means you putting something on our heart to go here to go there to do this or that the lord whatever it is may we be faithful to do it may your word lord shine forth once again and shine forth in this place in this assembly that you've given us these beautiful people that have come here i love so dearly god bless them exceedingly bless those that are streaming lord bless each one lord let's put forth the effort lord in this service and all that's gone into making it a success in this place this church lord it's your work god and we give it into your hands and thank you for it lord we rebuke every demonic spirit every devil out of hell that would try to hurt or infiltrate or hinder this service in any way that you would get the glory and the honor and the praise for all that is said and done now speak from your word father once again and accomplish that in it which you would send it forth to us for as it not returned void and we give you all the praise honor and the glory for it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 says arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee the gentiles shall come to thy light and the kings to the brightness of thy rising and you could be seated if you'd like it's a powerful statement it's powerful scripture many have spoken from i have a few times speaking on the darkness speaking on the gross darkness today the darkness in the land the gross darkness the people i really want to focus though on the first part of this today brother branham spoke a couple of messages well i spoke shalom a couple of times in the sierra vista phoenix and he takes this as one of his subject scriptures on a rise shine now it's it's hard sometimes because when you when you try to say it or you hear it in your mind or even as brother branham read it from the scripture if you go look at the shalom in sierra vista he says arise and shine but that's not what it says it says arise comma shine amen now there's really no difference and arise and shine or arise shine means the same thing but it all it it makes you feel like there's something through this conjunction that is a dual purpose that we're supposed to do so my title today is arise and shine rise and shine so i want to focus on the light today but let's let's get to a little bit of what's going on in the world today um we've gone through revelation 13 and i'm not going to get into all that again in the uh the politics and the political spectrum of it and and the scriptural part of the political spectrum and the commercialization and the love of money and all those things so we know all that's driven that's driven by the world but there's but god has given us something that rises us above that god has given us something to take us beyond that god has given us something that we can live here in this world but not be of the world god has given us something that we can be children of god and still be pilgrims here that we can still live in this world and we can still live for god and that god that and that purpose that god has given us is what's leading us through in this life that we grow unto the lord more and more like him that's the desire that we did that we have in our hearts that's what when the holy spirit come brother branham says the bride becomes the word he is the word and the two married together he said heaven and earth embrace one another right so if we're if that embraces took place then that light is shining amen so it says arise and shine the light is come but look what it also says for behold the darkness the darkness not a darkness but the darkness well we know what that the darkness is that the darkness is satan and we're living in satan's eden the devil the red dragon satan himself is that the darkness and that the darkness in satan's eden is covering this land right we know that never much more than never any more than it has been or is right now right that the darkness has covered this world now we're not talking about the fact that the sun's not shining we know that's not true or the moon's not shining we know that's not true the stars are still there moon's still there sun's still there it's beautiful and bright outside in tucson arizona but it's talking about the spiritual darkness that has now overcome the world that is now a gross darkness overcome the people a gross darkness so that gross uh we think we say the word gross we think oh that's nasty but that's not what this gross means it's not a nasty gross it means heavy thick black dark a thickness of darkness not just a regular darkness uh i've said this before but if i if any of you ever gone into a cave or a cavern or or colossal cave for example uh i know in colossal cave when brother branham went there brother branham got the inspiration when he went to the cave of there's a man here who can turn on the light brother branham got that sermon and that sermon title from that going in that cave and standing there you ever done it and you stand there and the man flips the switch off you can put your hand right here and you can't see a thing that's the gross darkness you know if you turn the light off it would get dark in here but it wouldn't get so dark that you couldn't see a little bit or have some in your pupils adjust and everything but the gross darkness is that there's such a total blindness that people are oblivious to the things that's going on around them now we know that was the promise of laodicea they would be poor visible blind wretched naked and not even know it how can they not know it because they're blind right the blind leaves the bond the blind's leading the blind they all fall in the ditch well how are they blind they got eyes they can see they have ears they can hear but they can't see spiritually they can't hear spiritually because a gross darkness has encompassed them and overcome them to where you could put a hand in front of them you could show in the bible exactly the way it's supposed to be and they won't see it right they won't believe it they can't see it right right that gross darkness has overcome them it's so heavy and it's so thick and this is that last day we're living in that last day we know that so if it's not going to be now when is it going to be such a religious gross darkness that are upon the people i'm not talking about a political darkness i'm not talking about a commercial or phys i'm talking about a spiritual darkness that has overcome the world amen and a gross darkness that has overcome the people it is so thick you can put something as plain as day in front of them and they cannot see it right they will not see it sometimes they refuse to see it that's right i mean me and brother tom's had conversations before you know brother tom does the the gym show every year which uh supposed to be pushed back this year but he sees tons of people all the time you know all kinds of people all walks of life all ages and and religions and spectrums and different countries and things and and uh you know and and when the lord puts it on his heart he tries to witness the people and talk to people and he said you just you just can't even hardly talk to people anymore you try to bring up a subject about god or about the bible well they don't even that god might be okay but they don't want to hear anything about the bible even religions and and people who call ourselves christians today don't even believe the bible right right they might think they follow it in a certain context but that's it if it crosses their doctrine or something they believe or think well they just do whatever they want to do right well the truth is they are in gross darkness and even though they can read a bible they don't know what it says there's no revelation there there's no light that shines upon it to bring it real to them so that's all they have that's all they know and that's all the denominations has done and in this world today yep brother brown told us there's such an extreme mental illness that has struck people there's such a mental illness that is going across the land today that that that people can't even understand common sense things right you've heard the phrase common sense isn't so common anymore well it you know that is true but this actually transcends even that uh it is so dark that they just can't even understand or see wow through the mental incompassibilities of their minds of their lives they just they do things that are just well not to be ironic but they do things that are uh that make no sense just idiocy forget about the hypocrisy forget about the uh it you know they can do this we can't do that we can do that they can't do this uh you know these people live by this and but but don't expect me to live by that well you have to do it that way but don't expect me to do it that way when it comes my turn i'm going to do whatever i want to do forget about the hypocrisy just the just absolute lapse of mental capacity to to understand common sense things is is almost completely eroded out of our society right mental illness has struck this and brother madam said it would he said it was then 60 years ago and he said it would even more how much more has it gotten to that place well why is it that way right because it's so dark amen there's so much darkness yes truth only comes through light yes truth doesn't come in darkness that's right truth only comes through light and unless there's a light to eliminate there's no way they can see and if they can't see how can they know and if they don't know how can they operate or act or live that way right they can't do it because it's gross darkness people don't want to know the truth don't bother anybody with the truth you can show facts you can show proof you can show even and scripturally in the bible and they don't care they had their own agendas they had their own way they had their own thoughts don't encumber me with the truth i i the truth is disrupting what i want to do what i want to accomplish so it it it falls into the poor miserable blind wretched naked category right and and as it does they don't know it but they don't want to know it right they desire not to know it their everything about them does not want to know now i'm going to come back to uh to this scripture because i want to get to our rise and shine before we end this in fact i want to major on that i only wanted to spend a few minutes on the dark part of it we've been talking about a dark part for several weeks now and how dark it is out there and what's going on out in the world today and how dark but to understand and get to the premise of why and how that it's got to that place first of all you turn down god and what you see in the world as i've said before what you see in the world today is nothing but the resulting effect of what happens to a nation and a world that has turned god down it's just the resulting effect of what happens and we're living here and we're living here but this is not our world this is not our this is not our home right amen this world cosmos is not our home this world earth is our home right we'll come back and live on this earth but this cosmos is not our home we'll get to that a little bit later but look at saint john chapter 3. saint john chapter 3 what jesus said uh we'll begin with the 14th verse one of the very first scriptures probably the very first scripture i ever learned in a baptist church is a little boy john 3 16. amen i learned to quote that about as soon as i learned how to talk amen and it's and it's a wonderful scripture it's a good scripture but that but john 3 16 has to be married with matthew 1 uh 18 i believe it is where jesus said i come i come to save my people amen let me see if i can find that because then they can we can couple those two together he come to save his people from their sins his people amen 20 matthew 1 21 excuse me i got that completely wrong but it is matthew 1 21 and she shall bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins and you've got to couple that with john 3 16 to come up with a correct understanding of the bible right if you just take 3 john 3 16 alone you would think well every human ever born is going to be there every human ever born is going to make it god come that every human no matter how wicked or evil or whatever they did they're going to be okay in the end you think because for god so loved the world amen but you have to understand that matthew 1 21 has to go with it right right he jesus shall save his people only his people what did we say before god's not responsible for those that aren't his right i'm not responsible for my next door neighbor their house their land i'm not responsible their children their cattle i'm not responsible for anything it's theirs i'm responsible before god what's mine right that's what i'm responsible for right jesus god is responsible for those that are his amen and those that are his are the ones he came to redeem brother madam called them the redeemable i don't know if you find that in the dictionary but that's what brother branham called them the redeemable so that's what i'll say he said the redeemable god came to redeem those that were redeemable his people john 3 14 9 as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up the whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life he said well this person believes on it this person believes on him everybody believes on him everybody believes there's a god anybody that says they believe god believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life well um if you believe in something you're going to live it right if you believe in something you're going to act like it you're going to it's going to be produced from your actions from your life people say they believe god but there's no production of jesus in their lives so they can say they believe him but do they well obviously they don't because their fruits bear out what they are and what they believe that's right for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god now listen to this and this is the con uh condemnation that light amen light has come into the world jesus christ was the apex epitome the the fullness of that light that light was that life that life was zoe zoe the literal life of god amen amen come into the world that light is coming to the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil now why do people want to live in darkness today because their deeds are evil why do they want to stay and grow start why would somebody i mean just think if you were in that cave and a man turned the light off and you could not see your hand right here would you want to stay that way i don't think there's a person in that cave including the man that turned the light off that wouldn't want to stay that way they wouldn't want a little bit of light at least to get out of there amen something right but people stay that way and they remain in that condition purposefully because their deeds are wicked amen their deeds are wicked and they love the darkness rather than the light because of it they want to stay in the darkness because their deeds are not manifest in the darkness you can't see anything nothing is made known nothing is revealed nothing is opened up everything stays on the cover everything stays covered up and of course you know then then all those that are uh controlling in power and take over and uh lord of you all their deeds are just they're they're they're uh they're uh uncoverable they're in darkness men rather have darkness than light i'll be honest with you i i not that i would lie to you but it's a figure of speech probably shouldn't say that but anyway um i was i was praying the other morning and and a thought come to me about what this country's been going through and how it's evolved and and i went back in my mind maybe as far as ronald reagan and presidency because you know the presidency has con has control of the basically the free world really i mean he's the leader of the free world they say but uh and i thought about going through that i was just a kid and then where hw came and clinton came and and you know come up to this time and and then bush and obama uh and i and i thought as i looked at it it seemed like to me republican or democrat you're part of the deep state it doesn't matter if you're part of the ruling class if you're part of the elite if you're a part of that swamp as forgive me but trump called the swamp if you're part of that it doesn't matter brother graham said it's rotten to the core so republican democrat doesn't matter right it doesn't matter oh it's right right so i thought as as as you saw it coming republican democrat democrat republican all the way and i thought and then it come up to about four years ago and and and not that donald trump was some great man or anything we know he had the morals of an alley cat when when people elected him they weren't i don't think people elected him because of that uh i think they elect him because uh he was a popular man people knew him he had a name and he was a successful businessman and they thought well if anybody can turn it around it can be him right anyway uh but then it but then it it it went from there to a place to where the man began to call himself a non-denominational christian and we've never had a president call himself a non-today non-denominational christian not publicly anyway and and as i thought lord again i was praying and i thought lord why why then now if we've gone back to this why then wha was he even elected why why did you allow because again god puts them up god takes it down so if he's in there just trust that's god's will right is he by the scripture so i thought why then did did you even bring that that little respite where uh people were prosperous again and there was jobs again and there was more security and you didn't look on the news every night and see isis chopping off another human's head or americans headers and all that went away and i thought you know the success of those things and and and and and israel and you know we honored israel and we were good friends with them and and all the things that went along why was that four years because everything now is just going right back to where it was and i thought why why was that put in there why lord did you interject that and i really cause i really didn't know i said why why was trump even elected why did you just keep rolling down the way it was going the next morning in prayer i think god showed me which brought me to this scripture because what happened during those four years one of the one of the most prominent things in my opinion happened during those four years was that a lot of the deeds and a lot of the misdoings and a lot of the corruption and a lot of the darkness that was in all of them controlling all of that got exposed right it's it's things that you knew was there but you kind of ignored it and it was just kind of under the uh under the radar and you knew people were crooked you knew they were bad you know all this you know and you just kind of you know as long as my four no more and we're good and we're just going to keep on trucking and whatever they do but they're but but in the meantime they're destroying other people's lives right uh they're ripping jobs from people destroying their lives i thought as long as people just keep going and he knew it was there but now all this came to the forefront light got shone on a lot of the corrupt evil deeds that these people were doing right and this man is not a politician he wasn't in there because he wanted to be popular or because he wanted obviously he wants to be popular because you won't be president if you're not popular people have to vote for you but uh money i mean he was he's a billionaire he didn't care about the money he didn't care about whether he had some political career after this or was going to make a career out of being a politician or something so you know with the heart of the people want to create jobs and want to do some what's best for americans and keep americans safe and those things then uh that's just kind of what he did a lot of people didn't like his tweets as several of them i wasn't proud of but anyway again the man he was just just he's just a man you know just a secular human but i thought but what he did was that he took and and pulled the cover back from a lot of all of the evil stuff that's going on the things that we didn't know deep rooted even in our uh our american institutions like fbi uh the cia uh even congress the media of course and social media oh my goodness if anybody got exposed in the last four years it was how biased and dark the media and social media is i mean they're just absolutely corrupt yes that's right this absolutely dark gross dark uh can't see the hand dark yes uh all that come exposed people it wasn't so much so that way four years ago when all this was coming but then when all these things began to infiltrate through here you thought why that's that's wrong that's wrong that's wicked that's evil that's bad and and the number and the sheer volume of of the institutions and people that are deep rooted in these institutions they're just absolutely wicked people they're just they're just evil which highlights our understanding of this for 60 70 years because the prophet told us it was rotting to the core right and as my dad used to say and the core is rotten too but what did brother branham tell us happened to the core of the apple wasn't that woodpecker pecking on it like the socialist communists and all that stuff he said what destroyed america was the the worm in the middle of the apple that ate the core of the apple the the morals the ethics the the the rightness of the countries morals that had decayed this country into what it was and what it is and become so drug dependent this nation is so drug-dependent friend that you can't stop the flow of illegal drugs coming into this country there's too many people in power and too much money to be had it's wicked evil killing our unborn children by the millions you know what happens you know what biblically happens to a nation that destroys their children god destroys them brother adam saw this nation burnt border border coast to coast yes how's it going to have i don't know right but it wouldn't take much no this this country sitting on a powder cake friend all it takes is a little rumble of california maybe go under a little earthquake over in yellowstone with that super volcano and this place is history yes border border coast to coast it will happen yes amen i don't believe i'll be here to see it but it will happen amen that because it's gotten to that place god is taking over that darkness is coming in i remember years ago i don't know if it's still the same but years ago seattle used to be a place people did not want to live because it was so cloudy and dreary all the time the suicide rate in seattle was so high that it was at alarming rates but it was like that because of the climate it's it's cloudy i hear it's cloudy overcast no sun for 80 of the year and you think about moving from here to there my we're like 90 sun uh we're like tops in the country for the amount of sun we get in a year even though florida calls themselves the sunshine state we actually get more sun here more days of sun in arizona than anywhere in the country but in seattle people used to kill themselves because it's a mindset people go up there and all the darkness and the dreary and and the weight of all that on people and and they were committing suicide by warming rates i don't know if it's still the same because people have flocked to seattle now have they become so used to the dark have they become so used to the dreary the weary the the darkness that it really just doesn't matter anymore right i hear now people are committing suicide now you got to be i say this because you got to be in a very dark place to commit suicide in my opinion so but i hear now that people are committing suicide at alarming rates because they're being cooped up all the time they can't get out they can't go do what they want they can't eat their favorite restaurant they don't have a job they've lost all their money they've lost their living it looks like a person that's been a waitress all her life isn't ever going to be a waitress again or things like that or cook or own a restaurant or or airline industry in those things i mean they're just absolutely wanting to destroy those industries what they're doing is keeping control over people darkness is darkness and people are killing themselves because they don't like it there there's people there's now i i'm i'm just going to give them the benefit of doubt i'm going to say they're well-minded well-intentioned people don't ask me if i truly believe that but i'm going to put that on tape that actually on tv are saying that if you supported donald trump you need to be deprogrammed we need to deprogram those people like i'm a malfunctioning robot or something right you need to be if you're a conservative if you're and you know where they're headed with this they're not headed necessarily with people that supported donald trump they're headed for you right yeah they're headed for christians bible-believing christians right amen i don't drink at starbucks and and it's i don't like coffee but anyway and if you do that's perfectly fine but i never went a lot anyway but when i found out the phone the founder and owner of starbucks said if you're a bible believing christian you're not welcome in my restaurant i quit going now does it matter whether i go or not no that's just how i feel right and that's fine and if you you like it and you go that's fine my sis my daughter loves it and that's fine micah got her a gift certificate for christmas and that's perfectly fine but when i heard that it's there's that attack see the attack on people that are believers christians people that believe the bible not just go to church and and and say oh i'm a christian and live however they want no a bible-believing christian and a bible-believing christian truly by revelation is not welcomed in this country not welcomed in this world anymore this bride is being squeezed out to where god is making her like him to come home to be with him right amen so god will just take her home instead of the people because this has happened before right this is not noon happened in israel in egypt when when egypt encompassed the children of israel because there arose up a pharaoh who knew not joseph right but if we got today anyway there rose up a pharaoh who knew not joseph and what he do he put them in chains and and made them serve with rigor and hard bondage as slaves he made them serve as slaves but it's not going to get to that point today because we're at the end right it might engulf and close in on his friend but before they can clamp down on us we're going home amen it's time for a rapture for this anti-bride yes that's the time we live not a time of slavery not a time of making everything okay and good and people want to make this world okay and want to make it a better place to live that's all fine and good friend but that's not my calling my calling is to get a bride ready to go home to meet jesus my calling is for me to get ready to go home to be with him that's my desire that's where i'm focused that's what i'm looking to for us to get out of here not move forward but move up i'm ready to change my residence to heaven amen what's that one uh one hallelujah square whatever it's called that's where i want to go that's where i want to live the light has come notice how gross darkness covered the people in egypt because all the plagues that that that hit egypt didn't hit israel it hit egypt all the plagues all the things that that moses that god called down through moses that was a judgment on egypt wasn't a judgment on israel it was a judgment on egypt and when egypt received that judgment what was the last judgment they got and don't tell me that this world in this country is not under judgment right right this country spurned grace many many years ago and when you spurn grace there's nothing left but judgment what was the judgment that egypt was under and then what was the last judgment gross darkness went through the land and caused death the death angel came and swept through there it didn't hurt israel because god had a way of escape for her but it destroyed and killed everyone the firstborn of egypt through the gross darkness that came through the land and created death now it's not a spiritual death or a physical death but a spiritual death right that's grip the people but what does that mean for the bride that means for the bride that it's time for her to arise amen for her to shine because thought has come amen and the glory of the lord is risen upon us yes that's our time amen that's our time to arise to shine to let that word shine through us it's not a time to be playing church it's not a time to be laying down and slumbering and sleeping and being lazy it's a time to rise and let the glory of god come and fall upon us and let us rise and shine amen that let that light that light encompass us and take over us look what it was uh in the in the at the last day let's go to uh matthew chapter 25 i think i marked it out here where i put it matthew 25 here we go we all know the scripture well amen arise shine rise means get up amen stand up get on your feet amen amen show who you are amen let the world see you're the you're the light of the world today god's light is shine upon you and shine through you today but it's time to rise and shine and let that light shine because the darker it gets the light the brighter the light shines right well if it's gross dark you could light a match in here you could go outside in the sunlight might imagine but light match wouldn't look like much but if you light a match in colossal cave when the lights turn off it'll illuminate you'd probably see everybody in there right yeah you can see all around you just from a simple stick match yes well that's the way this gross darkness is friend if you're rising shine is showing the rest of the world what's going on today true amen i want to get you this quote here in a minute micah's got something i want you to look at too now matthew 25 let's read through this real quick and we'll get to that then shall the kingdom of heaven be like another ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five were foolish now this isn't talking about the unbeliever this is the foolish and the wise and foolish virgin right right five of them were wise five were foolish and they and they they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps so it's not just a physical anointing it's an indwelling presence of christ it's a continually a continual flood of that oil notice in the in the menorah there was that oil that stayed in there that that was feeding that lamp all the time you didn't light it and then when it just burnt down it went out it always had an oil that kept flowing through well that's what the wise virgins got they got christ they got the the holy spirit they become born again filled with his spirit so that that oil continues to work and live through you amen not just an anointing that'll hit you in church and burn off when you go to work right right but it's always there it's flowing keeping you alive keeping you lit well the foolish virgin didn't get that all they got was a nice spark of the anointing and then it and then it just fizzled out when it fizzled out they uh but let's get to this part the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept all ten of them were asleep they all ted were being lazy slumbering sleeping and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him all of the virgins arose they were all asleep now they all arose they all arose and trimmed their lamps now if you ever seen a lamp you know what trimming lamp means if you haven't seen a lamp or lantern you may not understand but a wick is a is a is a pure element that uh a cord or whatever it's made of that that will burn fire as long as it has something to keep it going but the fire will actually begin to make the wick uh all gnarled up and and burnt on the end um if you've ever seen a lamp that's that's a that's a brand new wick the the flame burns pure and it's like a nice orb to it it's really pretty but once you get carbon and all built up on the end of that wick that that flame will start flickering and it'll jump around and part of it won't be lit and it and it won't give out the kind of light it's supposed to but if you trim that lamp and you take and you trim that carbon off of it you get back down to the original you get about back down to that that's the that's the real part and you get rid of all the clutter and all the junk that that's closing that that's clogging the channel it's clogging the the communication between you and the lord and you get rid of all that stuff the worldliness the ungodliness whatever it is and you trim all that off and that lamp just begins to burn pure beautiful nice orb again so they all trimmed their lamps they all arose they all trimmed their lamps and the foolish thing and why give us your give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out so obviously they let their lamps were lit at one time they were actually on fire for god at one time but once that anointing faded away once that anointing burned off once they got out from under it they didn't have anything they were they were living with the same old devil nature they were when they were born but when you're born again and that continual oil keeps burning then it never goes out it continues to burn and will keep burning it'll never go out but the wise answer is saying not so lest there be not enough for us in you but go you rather than that sell and buy for yourselves brother graham said watch for those that go those nominations those nominational people start trying to go after that oil watch that's that's the time the bridegroom comes amen yeah and they're absolutely doing it yeah right absolute now they think they got these prophecies and gifts and all these things that they made your own friend but the light has not come to illuminate your gift the light has come to illuminate the word and to illuminate the word to you so that it becomes a revelation to you and when it becomes a revelation to you you become like the word you become the word and you live what the word is amen because you are the word at that point yes you are the word at that point amen is that okay to say you are at that point you are the word amen and that word illuminates through you it's shiny because you've risen you've shook off all the other skin it's not a time to be playing churchman shake all that other off and let that light shine as you've arisen let it shine through you today amen when they went to buy the bridegroom came they were ready went in with and they that were ready when went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered said verily i say unto you i know you not in other words he's not saying i never knew you or you were never part of me he's saying i'm ignoring you yeah that's if you look it up you'll see that word no means that he's i'm i'm turning my back i'm ignoring you because they didn't get what they were supposed to get when they had the time and chance to get it amen that's why the so valuable important to understand being born again amen amen i know you're not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh now these foolish that the all the virgins arose but the foolish didn't have enough oil or if the oil in the right place now it's all the same and brother abraham said it's all the same anointing it's the same holy spirit the people in the denominations or wherever they get under that anointing they stand and say praise the lord what a brother man talk about the terror and the and the wheat they both the rain coming they both stand and praise the lord the week stands up praise the lord tara says praise the lord i got the water the others stand out here praise the lord but then when all that anointing's gone where are they amen that's right the bride is the one that's standing on the word because that oil continues to feed and and lubricate and keep that person shining amen keep them shining from the soul from the inside out person other just got an anointing on the flesh or spirit or something and that's all they had was just a simple anointing but it went out but now those that had their lamps their vessels continuing to burn are showing and shining because they arose that's what it said when when when they were shaking at midnight and remember the bible says everything that can be shaken will be shaken when they were shaken at midnight they stood to their feet they rose up they shook themselves and they began to shine because their light had oil on it they trimmed their lamps and their light was shining bright and beautiful because that's the way it's supposed to do amen look at this last day if michael put that up for me here i'll read you a quote i'll read you the quota she's got we've seen this before many times it's in the church age book but i want you to see it i thought this would be a little bit better maybe than me trying to draw those on a board again believe it or not those dark circles are hard to draw on a board with a dry erase question you mark on it when you mark back over it you erase part of what you put on there the first time it just doesn't look right but now look at this i'm going to read this he said then we see before the seven seals that hit all the mysteries that hid all the mysteries me not knowing what i was drawing on the board for the church ages i never god knows just by vision this is what brother brown says now you gotta you gotta listen to what he's saying he said he drew this by vision so that means this wasn't just something that was uh you know in brother branham's mind or something this was something he did by a vision god showed it to him right he said by vision i draw it not knowing that god a year and six months later was going to vindicate it in the skies by the moon and slip it across the national papers i did not know that i didn't know there would be a mysterious blackout in the moon to represent this laodicean age now look what he's talking about with the laodicean age we know is the last one sorry we got two tvs i can't do both of you but you see the loud to see it on the very end okay you got darkness increasing and going up to the part that we got to the philadelphia age just after the dark ages where the light began to shine a little more under the reformation and and wesley and the philadelphian age and the open door and the door of evangelism and missionary work that open door was missionary work sorry i'm probably right in your face aren't they uh streaming uh a missionary age and sorry you can't see this but uh anyway but then you notice in laodicea how brother brown drew that elead it ebbed back away from light you notice it was mostly light in the first church age and then it was ebbed ever so much each age into more and more darkness and then in the reformation time philadelphia age open door it began to bring back a little light again right remember we talked about that a couple of weeks ago with the the with the uh enlightenment time and understanding the difference between enlightenment and and um uh the the development of science and reason and and those things and and those things have their place but not with faith and with science and region but now this enlightenment is is bringing light because of the gospel that was being preached the gospel that was going forth the printing of the gutenberg press it was printing of the bible people got the bible in their hands they could read the bible god could uh deal with those people you notice in the dark ages the light almost completely out right but god instructed brother branham to draw that the way he did because it was still bright even during the dark ages right still bright still there at that time but now he says in the lao the sin age the mysterious blackout of the moon the laodicean age that's the day that we're living today yes now we're not a part of the layout to see an age we feel the effects of it yes but this bride has moved into a bright age amen she's in a different place now she's in a we live here and we feel the effects of that spirit and of this age but we're not of this world we're not of this age we're pilgrims and strangers amen we're part of a bride age now that's come out of laodicea but laodicea is still here and the effects of leo the seal still here now he says now on the papers he says you only get the six ages in the newspapers where the moon showed it he said you only get six of them there he said is because the laodicean church was blacked out completely right yes my friend now he's not talking about the president he's not talking about the government he's not talking about politics or economics or he's talking about the church yes the loud to see a church of which god they put god on the outside and you see him at the end of revelation 3 knocking to get into his own church blacked out they don't want god anymore they don't want the bible anymore they don't want the bible they don't want god if they don't want the bible friend they don't want me that's right they don't want god they don't want me they don't want the bible they don't want me they don't want god because they don't want the bible anymore they want a seminary or some kind of doctrine or something that that follows along with their fancy they want to trans uh translate this true bible into so many different translations that it barely resembles what it's supposed to say right oh we'll see what this says here and and you read this uh so that has that that doesn't even have a a mirror of what it's supposed to say in the original context right but they translate it so much how many translations of the bottle there are now right probably thousands of different translations they're going to translate it so far down and say hey dude how y'all doing today right yeah right that's what the bible's going to end up saying to those people oh you all right it's good the see the woman caught in the act she was she was dope whatever i don't know what that means i've heard it before i mean that's how mentally ill and how badly this has gotten yeah right well it's supposed to be laodicea was completely blacked out right no light at all and friend shall i say it is dark yes it is completely black laodicea is completely black you see i've said this many times they'll just see it completely blacked out and if you would notice the spiritual application as god said it in the heaven when i said it here on earth i left a little bitty space as you see just a teeny little bit of light that was just before the very elected just the elected was to be called from the earth amen he said that's why i put that in there was to be called from the earth he said the reason i placed it on there for that seventh age that little bit of light he called it little bitty a bit of light teeny little bit of light he said he put that for the bride but then when he comes to tell about this alive and remain end-time bride group he says you are in the bright age uh i i i call you my wife now that's a different trans transforming from one office to the other from one position to the other it's no longer laodicea laodicea is completely black but this bride is the only light that there is in this world today the only light there used to be others things that shine forth a little bit but the only bride that's like the only light of this last day is the bride yeah he put that little bit of light in there he said for that end time bride that end time that would represent the very elected amen the very elected at that end time yes but we live this bride is is gone beyond and above laodicea we feel the effects of it we still live here but we're not a part of it right amen we're in the world but not of the world that's right amen amen oh that little bit of light that's there that's her that's us that's you but but literally brother adam said when god put it in the heavens when god put it in the heavens he blacked number seven out completely completely so that should represent or show us where we're living today right where are we we're living in a place we're living in a world living in a country completely black gross darkness devoid mostly of any kind of principles and morals right yes if there's any to be left there's a maggie here or a uh or a leah there or you know our families or someone there may be one here one there i mean brother branham talked about gleaning time 60 years ago gleaning back then now that doesn't stop what we do i guarantee it won't stop brother tom from talking to people at the gym show about the lord i guarantee you that i know him well enough i believe that it won't stop me i don't believe it will stop you we still do what we're supposed to do but we understand where we're living we understand what's going on today and how close we are to getting out of this place with the things that god is doing god has shown light and it's been proven that we can see by national relevance media social media government everything that it's completely black right and their deeds have been exposed many times many times so there's probably tons of we still don't know but it has been exposed and they don't care right right they blatantly bled bless break and and and forget about the law and they put it in your face and they don't care right and nobody says anything about it they get away with it yeah but this is our time amen this this is our time the world has their time they're doing their thing that's okay that's up to them they got their place but we have our place amen that's right our place is in jesus christ the word there's the evening light is to come brother brown said that at the evening time it shall be light well what is this evening time light that's shining forth it's you it's i that it's that it's our time arise shine for thy light look at that i like that's beautiful it says the violite amen has come not a not another light not a not an arbitrary light or somebody uh uh uh trying to shine some other kind of religious light or something the light amen the light of jesus christ the word amen it's the word of god because the glory of the lord is risen upon us the gentiles shall come to this life and the lord shall rise upon thee oh friend what is it today we're living in a time where god has come and sent us a word vindicated word prophet to bring a message of the hour for us to be able to rise because the light has shined and that word is illuminating again to show us that we live in that light amen god has brought us a light to live in yes praise the lord amen jesus said as long as i'm in the world i am the light of the world well is jesus in the world today yeah he is you're looking at him amen i'm looking at it true amen amen amen because he's in the world today he's living through you yes he's living through me and if he was the light then he's the light today he's still the light but how is he the light today he's not the light just in one human body one person that stood on the soil at one day now he come back in a mini-member body and that light is illuminating all over the world his bride all over the world of every kindred tongue nation people his light is still shining because they are the light of the world am i saying john chapter one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life zoe you're just talking about the literal life of god brother graham said zoe the literal life of god and the life was the light of men amen praise the lord that's the light amen that's the glory that's the word that's christ christ the word coming to reveal himself to illuminate through you that the the word today is still a living word because it's living in you amen god didn't come to bring a bride to rapturing faith because of prophecies or because of gifts or speaking in tongues he come to bring faith to rapturing faith to a bride for this last day through the hearing of the word of god amen not the word of a man not the word of a denomination walk the word of the seminary but the word of god amen the pure word of god for this last day amen god has brought light unto it it was the light of man that life was the light of men the light shineth in darkness and the darkness does what comprehended it not amen they can't they can't no more than the jews could see they were crucifying their messiah can these people see what is going on with this word today right amen the difference is the jews will finally have their reconciliation the gentiles will not yes amen the jews will finally recognize they crucified their messiah and they'll take their clothes sackcloth and ashes and their mourning and god will say they say where'd you get those scars in the house of my friends and they'll realize what they did and they'll have that coming home brother brahman said amen that three-fold purpose of the seventh visit uh the of daniel uh gabriel 70 weeks uh daniel 70 weeks in the vision of gabriel excuse me i'm getting that all mixed up that that he told us they would they'll receive him the others will not they become cannon father darkness amen darkness grows darkness they comprehended not there was a man sent from god whose name was brother brown excuse me i don't want to change the word amen whose name was john but in this day we not only follow what we read about john but we know what we follow and what we believe and what god brought through a prophet brother brown amen amen it was sent from god too yes the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that life that was the true light which every man which light of every man that cometh into the world that true life why did that prophet why did god send him for this last day to forerun the second coming of christ to bring light amen right to take this word to bring a revelation of that word to a people so that that light through him revealing the word would illuminate a whole group of people yes a group as in millions around the world you played millions yeah when brother brown went on the other side he looked around he said those are your people he said my i didn't have that many branhams he said no these are your converts yes he said i look there's millions billions you know who was there me amen you praise the lord i believe that yeah you were there you are there amen by faith we believe god has already put us there time to shine friend it's time for us to come forth and shine god divided look in the beginning god said in the beginning uh of or genesis 1. let's read it i'm going to close with this in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep it was a mess the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and what did the spirit of god do it said let there be light and there was light amen maybe my spirit of god came forth and it was light he said let there be light that was light he is light remember in that new city of new jerusalem only light will have is christ right the lamb is the light that's right amen he come forth and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god did what he divided the light from the darkness amen because when light comes forth darkness has to scatter so god divided the light and the darkness so the darkness and the light had no fellowship we're not one with them we're not a part of darkness nor is darkness a part of light we're not a part of each other god has separated the light from the darkness amen we were talking to maggie yesterday and having our conversation and i said god is god has always uh made his people peculiar by worldly standards make when uh israel the jews and abraham he said okay uh i want you all to do this and they had all these feasts and these new moons and he had and god had him do this and that and he had all these different things and traditions and all that they did and religious uh uh acts and things that god that was that god had them do i mean i i don't know of any other ones it took the sacrifices animals and and the things that they did and and they were peculiar people when they were in egypt when israel was in egypt they were considered a rogue group they were a strange people they didn't fit in in egypt they weren't supposed to fit in in egypt and just as they didn't fit in in the world we don't fit in today right we're not supposed to fit in right we're of different people we're god called separated from the world god called the light from the darkness he divided them he separated us exposition of the church age i'll read this he that happened here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to a man but thank god in the last age there will be a group do what rise up amen in this last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in the day of gross darkness the light will return how not through prophecy not through gifts of the spirit speaking in tongues and all that's fine friend not having a problem with that but you may you can't major on a minor right right that's not what's going to get you in a prophecy it's not going to get you in the rapture having a gift of the spirit's not going to get you in the rapture it's not even going to get you any closer to god right amen right amen what does though is the darkness will give away to a light by the return of the pure word amen praise the lord that's it amen we'll return to the power of pentecost to welcome the lord jesus christ amen through the power of revealed word through the power of the light illuminating the light is power friend that light is power praise the lord and that power comes and divides that light from that darkness we don't have anything to do with the darkness friend it's time for us to rise it's time for us to shine forth it's time for us not to give in to all the things the fear and the control and stuff that's going on in the world we live in this economy we work we make money we eat we do the things that that's all fine and good friend but we're not here part of this world right amen we're going to a different place because we're a different people god's called god called to save the sins of his people amen praise the lord that and if that's you that's us we're a part of that god's called us to that to arise to shine amen wherever we go let that light shine friend let that light illuminate let it come forth from you because it's jesus christ the light of the world now living through us to let that light shine it's all the life this world is going to have amen amen we be led of the spirit of god be led of the lord let god move you wherever he wants you to do bro amen we do what the lord chose us to do a minute doesn't mean you quit your job doesn't mean that you spend 24 hours in in your closet or something or uh or be super spiritual or it just means living your life like said last week brother adam said one of the most carnal things you could say plant your potatoes just keep planting your potatoes that's what he said so that's what we do amen but if there's a day that god says okay you're not going to plant potatoes today i'm going to send you over here go over there oh yeah i got something somebody you need to talk to witness to i got somebody that you need to meet go do it whatever the lord does even if it's just walking through this and say you know what you need to get some spaghetti today for dinner tonight go to the store get spaghetti god's leading you to get it you know why because you might cross the path of somebody who needs to see you right who needs to feel the light and the spirit from you that might alter their day right yes amen you never know all the things that happens in the spiritual world friend we may not even know or see may not even after eternity enters in but god is in control of whatever he wants that's what we want for our lives to shine just let that light shine amen praise the lord let's stand if we could
