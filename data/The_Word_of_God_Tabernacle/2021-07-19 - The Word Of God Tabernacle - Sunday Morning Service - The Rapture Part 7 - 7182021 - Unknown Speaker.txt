[Music] is wonderful and my redeemer praises me [Music] saving me this morning uh we have one here written down from uh sister norma uh from sister judy uh she says she wants to thank oh this is a testimony actually so we'll start off with that since we don't have any prayer requests for him down but um from sister judy she wants to thank and praise the lord for answered prayer and taking over a situation that she cannot face i want to thank everyone for praising our praying that my dad's hearing will be found it has been several weeks now my dad has not had his hearing aids my stepmother texts me this morning that her daughter mary has ordered uh bad new hearing aids and it will be adjusted when he gets his fantastic does anyone have a prayer request at this time um derek's been released from the hospital they put it out the other end of community bridges which is and they want him to find a place to live so he called me yesterday i said check the bank and see if you've got any money in there first of all and and so that's my prayer request for a place for him um i may have to send him home to his mother he doesn't want to go he's 53 i understand but i you know i've got the same roadblocks i had before and people don't want to rent to somebody who was evicted and hasn't satisfied the eviction he it wasn't his fault it was his mother's fault yes um tomorrow morning at 7 30 they're going to run the buyouts and they still don't know what it is i'm trusting and believing just nothing amen and even when they go in they won't even find it praise the lord amen because i want to say this before the congregation my oncologist thinks it might be cancer and he was telling me lining up key mama didn't know so i'm going to claim the victory amen yes jesus uh um just kind of want to give kind of a testimony slash praise report um i do want to thank the lord for getting us all through covid it was pretty pretty bad my dad is still in the hospital and he ended up he was doing really good but he ended up getting a mrsa staff and cocci infection in the hospital so his oxygen had pulmonary so that's what we've been fighting since tuesday they had intubated him and i had just i don't know why i didn't think to put a prayer cloth and sister sonia reminded me of sister lydia's sister's testimony and so i just couldn't wait to get to the hospital and i put it on and his nurse that he had on tuesday i saw her yesterday and she said we can't believe how fast he's i am tired of living under my privileges he said we live below our privileges and i am just praying and confessing and believing that not only is all of this infection gone my dad's cognitive all of his cognitive will be restored and that he will be home by the end of the week he will be restored because god's not just a healer he's a restorer amen he loves the lord he can restore my dad prior to what he was at before coveted and even better and that's what i believe in yes amen amen so thank you all for praying you all mean the world to me and let's just stand as we take these things to the lord and give an unspoken prayer request just making those words really beneficial lord jesus we come before you and humility and thankfulness knowing that you're a caring and loving god that's mindful uh each and every need that has been expressed this morning and lord you heard the testimonies of even already that you're on the scene in your uh answering prayer and you're delivering us all from diseases and inflictions and depression and whatever we may go through we know father you said in your words first seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all shall be added unto you and as our sister already expressed we do live below our privileges when we get so caught up in the world we get carnal and we forget to seek you in everything we do knowing that the footsteps of the righteous our order of the lord and father paul said i can do all things through christ which strengthens me that means all for every little thing that comes in our lives father we need to seek your guidance your direction we need to believe on you for our healing for our deliverance for you already said it is finished it's a it's a thing it's been paid for totally at calvary and father we believe for each and every one is as our sister said or ready that i'm learning to realize it's not my battle is yours it's not my fight it's yours fathers we trust in you we will come out victorious but in the meantime with all these tests and all these trials we are going to believe on your name to the very end amen grant each heart's desire may their cup runeth over may you fill it to the overflowing portion as they reach out of towards you by faith lord but whatever they have need of may their cups deep deep into the running waters of life you are those waters lord granted bless our pastor lord as he brings forth your word use them to speak to our hearts and lord i might add my thankfulness for this humble nice place you have blessed us that we can worship you in spirit in truth as our brother already said our pastor we can go outside in the hills and worship you but you gave us a nice building till you tarry father and lord and that's one thing that speaks to my heart as brother brown said never lose your enthusiasm for the coming of the lord lord may we you always believe you can come even today and always live our life you're like you're coming that very day granted bless bless the manner of the service father in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen um yeah i just wanted to encourage all to continue to read your bibles and spend that time with the lord that a long time it's just been so tremendous what he does in that time amen when you shut everything else everything off and everybody out and it's just you and him there alone it's tremendous even what he does for you in that time he certainly he certainly does honor that yes he shows up so i just i know we all do that but i just wanted to encourage you to just yes [Music] um i just want to thank the lord um since i moved into the apartment time map one of the biggest problems i had was one of the big bars downtown and it's right at the corner of congress in the fourth and it was it's just been so loud for three quarters of my time there and um i think like a month and a half ago they closed for a renovation so um and i just knew it was gone never experienced that with illnesses sicknesses mental things or just happiness and spirit but um i i claimed that the sore throat was as far as it was going to go um and one day i woke up and i was just it was lifted i was light until it was gone about two days for the residual effects of that swelling and the soreness to go away but it was gone [Music] [Music] shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tears [Music] glorious what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face when he takes me by the hand and leads glorious day [Music] no more sickness who died for me amen [Music] upon his face [Music] through the promised land [Music] until then my heart will [Music] with joy my eyes behold until [Music] [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] this is [Music] if we recall their horrors [Music] and we remember [Music] not until [Music] until the day [Music] with god his toys [Music] is [Music] then with joy i'll carry on until my eyes [Music] see my eyes behold [Music] until [Music] is [Music] [Music] god [Music] until the day god calls us [Music] amen [Applause] thank you lord amen i have a small little song special around here it's a blessing to you all this morning [Music] [Music] and the ways [Music] friday [Music] maybe one more time [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] amen [Music] thank you [Music] amen [Music] more [Music] amen yes praise the lord um 596. thank you jesus is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i [Music] is [Music] lord [Music] oh with these [Music] me [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] me [Music] i [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i feel [Music] just like brother john and testified amen that paul is just getting so much greater you know the pool to go home is great but you know the poor just want to be alone with the lord yeah paul to just have a greater and a deeper relationship with him a whole to let everything else around the world and all the characters and the things of life just go by the wayside just let the lord handle those and amen and just feel that whole palm drawings to him and you know brother graham said that he that got to where he lived so close to god that god said enoch you're closer to me you are there come on home again praise the lord that's the full amount that's what we're looking for again that's what we're feeling is that full praise the lord amen i'm so thankful god's blessings in our lives so thankful of what the lord does for us every day and for what he's given to us in this hour with this message the truth of his word amen and the testimonies and miracles the things that's happening you know the one thing that sister julie of course there's a thousand things sister julie didn't put her testimony but the one thing that's very outstanding is the fact that her dad contracted cohort and the man has copd that's a death sentence normally you hear people without with outstanding uh physical ailments like that and get it it just that person just doesn't last long but god's really blessed he's negative for cody she didn't say that but he's negative for coping the verses in the hospital almost everybody i know that's in the hospital more than a week gets immersed so but uh god's been so good and we've testified and we've had prayer and we've had prayer requests and things for a month or more now heard of course her and her sister and niece have been negative for a while but um and their dad probably has too but uh all the things that's happened and developed and uh i believe and it just came on my heart one time and testimony to her that god just wanted to get her dad alone yeah maybe i just wanted to get her dad alone to where he talked to him you know sometimes we're resistant sometimes we're negligent to follow that pull but the lord will put us in a situation where we can know that much holy spirit amen and uh with the prayers that's gone up for dad and her dad's in god's hands amen and that's what matters the most and he's a child of god and he's going to be on the other side and no one can pluck him out of the hands of god commander praise the lord and that's what matters amen the most we get to the other side praise the lord you god bless you they stand to our feet if we could we'll just get right to the word i knew we were going to have probably um some things that were going to take a little time today so um i kind of mine feels like we have all the time now don't have to worry about don't still don't want to wear the people don't want to wear you well we have a service but i kind of felt when i was before we started moving yesterday and my time with the lord that uh just a shorter service that they would probably be more appropriate and of course you didn't expect the rain like i said we have so many more things we want to do we want to put a runner excuse our uh sonya got up early with me and vacuumed the rugs that we had those are from our house that we use so they they're not but they served the purpose that's what make sure that slippery feet didn't hit that slick floor because uh that's not a good combination but we want to do that we're going to paint uh everything and put curtains up here and over there there's just several things we want to try to do because you know we kind of drained the coffers when we moved in the place so we just uh wait and as things roll in then we'll just start working to get things done amen so but let's turn in our bibles now to first thessalonians chapter 4 where we've been beginning the past six sundays and of course again today that's first thessalonians chapter four still speaking on the rapture this will be the rapture part seven um and we'll just we'll just get this as we read it so first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 3 13 but before we read it again let's just fire our heads and approach the author father god we're indeed grateful lord again what you've given us today can never be overstated or emphasized or thank you enough lord because we feel so blessed we're just such a blessed people god if we could just uh we could just open our spiritual eyes like elijah said to hazel that day just to see lord the things that you're doing for us all the time the miracles that take place and the things that satan would try to do to us that you don't allow him that we never even know about god just just realizing what you do for us lord and everything is orchestrated by your hand and the child of god is always orchestrated and led by your spirit lord and nothing is done by chance nothing is done by luck or happenstance or consequence lord it's all in your great plan and we believe it and we thank you for it lord we thank you for being here today thank you for each one that has come may you just speak to us from your word once again today may you have complete preeminence in the remaining part of this service as i yield myself lord the best i can father the lord and brother brandon said the only gift he had was to yield himself that's the only gift any of us have lord he's just yielding ourselves that's all i can do lord to just try to yield myself lord i i lord it mentioned it maybe a little shorter service today but i don't want that to be a hindrance on the moving of your spirit lord whatever you'd have for us today god let it be lord if your spirit flows through here god it could be five hours and feel like 15 minutes we're just trusting you whatever you want that's what we want yes lord we just committed to you we ask your blessings anoint not just the speaker lord but to hear each one of us accomplish that that you send it forth for now as we commit it to you and ask your blessings upon it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen first thessalonians but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you saw and not even as others which have no hope for we which but for for for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would slip uh sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god of the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with uh with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you can be seated if you like amen so just uh as the lord would leave the the uh this part of the service today i felt that to go this direction and just see what the lord would do with it uh but i i just want to take from this the scripture that brother branham used when he preached the rapture message in december 4th 1965 11 days before i was born brother branham preached the rapture message in yuma arizona now obviously brother branham knew of course being a prophet that many of the things that brother branham brought many of the subjects that he touched on he did just that he touched on them uh some things he went into more depth like the seals like the church ages and things like that uh and but a lot of the things like the rapture message there's so many components to the rapture that brother branham spent just maybe an hour and 20 minutes i think the tape is just getting some of the highlights of the rapture and taking the scripture a lot of times when we talk about the rapture we begin a subject on the rapture or it comes on our heart to think about rapture we think about the scripture that i just read and that's one reason that i wanted to take the time to uh preface every rapture service that we have that the lord puts on my heart to read from this scripture but when brother brown preached in him of what the rapture message he went to psalms 27. now a lot of times people don't understand psalms 27 as a perplexity i've had questions i've had questions myself before why didn't brother brown start with first thessalonians 4 but if you go into psalms 27 and you read it and understand the text that brother branham takes from that point you will understand why he said why he started with psalms 27. i want to take psalms 27 and break it down a little bit because uh the part of the rapture i want to talk about today is the rapturing condition of the world the condition the world is to be in when a rapture or when the culmination of a rapture is to take place uh that's what i want to talk about the the the resulting condition what we're looking for a lot of times we talk about road signs and we talk about the the signs of the times as we call them uh those road signs and those signs of the times is just typically scriptural references that we have that we look to that gives us some guidance to see look this is like this is happening and we find it in the scripture or this condition exists now and we find that in the scripture and there's so many of those scriptural conditions that sometimes you just have to try to take the time and break them down oh brother branham when he goes in through the rapture message halfway maybe a third of the way through brother branham actually does come in quotes or i can't remember if he actually reads verse thessalonians 4 or if he quotes i think he reads it because then he starts to break down the shout out the voice and the trump which lord willing will do as well at some point when we get to that place but i felt in my heart to take this but what i got here is the resulting condition uh a rapturing condition of the world today the culmination we know the rapture is in process we know the body changes in process from glory to glory he's changing us right we're changing all the time and then change isn't just uh apparent to the physical body because the change that we're talking about happens from the inside out amen the last part to change is this bowel body that's the last part the change is already in process because the change started on the inside so as that's changing and it's changing your soul is born again and it changes your spirit which changes your nature and then begins to change the flesh well the flesh part the receiving of a new body is the last part that we get before we actually go in a rapture before we actually take to the sky yeah uh but the resulting condition now that's what i want to talk about so let's go to psalms chapter 27 and we'll read the few verses that brother branham read when he prefaced his rapture message amen psalms 27 amen is everybody comfortable amen is anybody not comfortable are you chilly cold except for sister enormous she tells me she's always cold so i don't mean to dismiss her but she doesn't count everybody anybody comfortable this is a trial in there you know uh i don't mean this comical but when i was sitting over there i'd see see you come in and it's like a deer in headlights you're like okay where do i sit now my place where i'm going to sit so i noticed the eyes as they perused the room and even matisse went there and then she went there and she went there and then she went there but uh she kind of moved around a little bit anyway she doesn't stay in the same spot like a lot of us do i always did that too so but i want to make sure you're comfortable the the air is just kind of a trial and error thing you just want to make sure everybody's okay so okay all right well nobody's saying anything so i guess we're okay i'm fine because the air is one right on me so i'm happy i usually get really hot so this this is good psalms 27 let's begin with the first verse just like everybody did i just i want to get to this point because i i actually believe that uh that was that was the premise that brother brown was taking when he began the rapture message when he began the rapture message i believe the premise that brother brown started out with in psalms 27 was that rapturing condition was the condition of of the rapture that it was to be so let's look at this as we go through it i'm going to break it down a little bit uh probably way more than brother brown did obviously but just give you what the lord put on my heart uh psalm 27 1 now the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear praise the lord so what does that tell us brother brown preached this and we know that he done it at the direction of the lord right i mean we i don't believe brother branham would have begun the rapture message with this scripture reference if it wasn't let of god right put it that way so when we read this let's take to heart what it's telling us in relation to where we are today oh yeah in the world what's going on around us and what the devil tried to close in on us amen notice not recognize we all recognize the satan's just not going to fold his arms and just say well i give up on that group of people they're they're just pride and they're just gonna go on a rapture and they're just too good for me so i'm just hands off i'm gonna quit you know the devil's not gonna do that he's gonna fight you every single inch of the way plus yeah and as he gets to the end you know he fights even harder as it gets towards the end so as we read this take that in reference in your mind of what the lord is speaking to us here the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear shall i fear death shall i fear the devil shall i fear the government shall i fear anything that the devil or any device that the devil would unleash on him and am i going to fear that no whom shall i fear right shall i i don't want to change the word or add to the word but what shall i fear right yeah not just not necessarily a person it could be anything what shall i fear yeah we've gone through a whole year and it's still happening in the world today the fear that's being placed on people in the world now now obviously there's some uh legitimacy to the people that are in the world and the fear that they feel there's legitimacy to that because a lot of those people don't know god yes right most of them don't know god right and even if they think they have a passing knowledge of god they know that's not good enough they might not acknowledge that uh consciously but in their subconscious they realize that's not good enough so they got to find or have something good enough that's going to get them to the point that they know that the lord is my light and the lord is my salvation and i will not fear amen amen fear is not faith fear is the absolute enemy of faith amen and there's no way we're going to go into rapture without faith without rapturing faith wrong the lord is my the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid amen now david says it two different ways but it's still the truth right who or what am i going to fear who or what am i going to be afraid of he's saying the lord is my salvation the lord is my strength the lord is my life why am i afraid why why am i worried why do i fear yeah he's saying and the whole premise of that question mark question mark don't right there is nothing to fear very much amen when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell yes how many times have you acknowledged or recognized that satan has come to try to destroy you and before he could even get a groundhog he falls amen amen and that impenetrable uh barrier that god has with the angels of god with flaming swords encamped around about you cannot be penetrated unless god were to allow it and if god allows it for some reason just like he did joke god's got a purpose for it but as it gets to that point the enemy struggles stumbles and falls because they are no match to god yeah but they are no match to you because you are of god amen amen you are of god little children there's no fear my wicked my enemies come up and they come to destroy me eat up my flesh is destroyed kill but they stumble and fell though and holy encamped against me my heart shall not fear though wars should rise against me in this will i be confident haven't you ever felt like you've been at war how many feels like you're at war now yes amen every day of our lives we're at war every night in our dreams in our sleep yeah amen um i hope sister julie doesn't mind me telling this but she was telling the other day she was talking to her dad and she was she's able to visit him now she's holding his hand and she asked him he said he seemed trouble said are you having bad dreams and she he squeezed her hand really hard and i said well if you'll hold my hand i'll squeeze so hard too because the devil does the same thing to me every day where at war every night we're at war who shall we feel yes amen what divides the enemy can ever overcome the faith and the love that you have and the life that you live and the god then the angels of god amen so many times we fear the unknown but when we're christians there's not an unknown right there shouldn't be because our faith should eliminate the unknown right amen our faith calls the things that are not as though they are how do they do that by faith they call things that aren't you say well it's the unknown no it's not because you control the elements saints you call the things that are not as though they are because you've got faith is that not the scripture amen amen and why why is it or what is there to worry about fret about nothing now look again got to continue to remember this is the resulting condition the the rapture and condition of the world that's going on today the enemy that's coming against you everything that's against and everything that's uh you look in the world even people that call themselves christians friend sometimes some of the people that call you christians are the first ones that want to chop your head off yes get rid of you eat up your flesh destroy your character right i mean um i i said that way but i've experienced it so maybe you have to but it's the truth in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord look at this now this is beautiful and i believe it's synonymous with us one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after amen so it's like brother john said so y'all don't see when i listen to these testimonies and i hear these songs and i see the resulting effect and the moving of the spirit it it shows me how who's in control of this because i because i know what the lord's already put on my heart to bring to you and when i hear testimonies like hers and like his and the songs and the things it it just it it just overwhelms me honestly i mean mike is sitting here saying i'll try to sing the song you just see when it overwhelms you like that friend it's just sometimes you just want to run out and just run around the building walk because the spirit of god is just so powerful but look at this one thing i've desired of the lord and that i will seek after isn't that just what he was saying and that just brother john said i i i encourage you amen what not his exhortation i encourage you to do what seek after him amen amen yes that thing that i desired my life from god that's the thing i will seek after amen that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temples for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock now we know the rock is crying he sets me upon that rock that rock was christ now brother ram didn't read the sixth verse i'm going to and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore my head lifted up above the enemy amen therefore will i uh offer in this in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord now in this part where there's a transition david talks about the enemy and he talks about the war and then he talks about in conjunction with talking about why do we fear god is my strength god is my life god is my health god is my portion god is my everything why do i fear why am i worried why am i afraid why do i be when the enemies come against me they stumble and they fall and then he transitions he transitions from that res from that rapturing condition that we know the world is in amen because you know the whole world's against you right yes you understand this is satan z yes and all of satan's eating is against god's children against god's pride we know that so you know the whole world is against you correct we all know that so even people sometimes it may even call your brother you know that's taken at home but that may be true yes amen against you so if you know it's all against you you know where your portion is you know where your strength lies and you know where one from where your deliverance comes amen is the lord so david comes as that result that rapturing condition of the world today which there was a time when this was a christian nation amen i i it's probably it's still the best nation on the planet in my opinion but it was once a uh a a christian nation they turned down god and you see the resulting effect right but it was once a christian nation no more obviously the whole world's the whole world's against us but he transitions from that condition to saying but there's one thing that i've desired one thing my whole life that i've desired of the lord and that one thing i seek after i seek after that one thing and he begins to unveil what his desire and that rapture is that in that that resulting in rapturing that takes place now i'm i'm not going to read it today but i i want to eventually if you want to look at it uh uh ephesians chapter 2. because i i want us to understand there's a physical rapture that we're looking for body change to it the changing of our bodies to go in a rapture to meet the lord in the air we know that physical rapture but there is a daily spiritual in rapturing that we enjoy as christians amen this should be a daily enrapturing every day that is caught up in with christ in heavenly places with christ jesus amen and that caught up is is an enrapturing a spiritual experience that we have and enjoy every day as a christian as a born again holy ghost still christian there's the physical one that we're looking for that we're going to but there's that spiritual one that happens all the time and that's what david's talking about see now he describes it as different dwelling places did you notice that as we read through it he i'm the four or five i forget here we'll read it again four or five separate different dwelling places that david mentions just in these couple of verses let's read it again this one thing i desire the lord i'll seek after that amen that i may dwell in the house amen that's one that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple that's number two for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion that's three three separate separate dwelling places that he mentions just right here every one of them different in the secret of his tabernacle four shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock amen look at this for just a moment that i may dwell in the house well in the house what is a house a house is a permanent structure a place where you live a place where you it's your place of abode it's where you live it's where you sleep it's where you have meals it's where you uh uh fellowship with your with your family and and all it's in your dwelling place it's where you it's where your bed is it's where your couch is it's it's your place of abode it's where you live it's a permanent structure in other words it's something that god has given that that david says that i may dwell in the house that it may be a permanent structure where everything that i do every part and every facet of my life that is that is in the house of god it is in this permanent dwelling place it's where i desire to live right period abode it's my permanent abode is in the house of the lord all the days of my life all the all my every day to behold and uh to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple now what is a temple a temple is not a place where you necessarily have a bed or a shower you have a dining table and you a boat and you you go to every single day or live in every single day a temple is a place that's that's a sacred uh uh a set aside a place of worship it's uh it's a uh it's dedicated for that purpose it's sanctified for that purpose it is a place of worship it's a place you go to just just like we have this this isn't our place of this is not our house we came from our houses we'll go back to our houses but this is a place that we come to that we inquire in the lord and enjoy the beauty of the presence of the holy spirit in this temple in this place that's been sacred and and and committed and dedicated to god that we come here and we worship the lord amen to do what to behold the beauty of the lord and inquire in this temple amen praise the lord that's where we come to expect god to move to expect god to meet us here amen for in the time of trouble he shall hide me now he's talking about being set into a sacred place and being set into a place where where he's hid away amen get away in the time of trouble he shall hide me now i hope you keep it in mind the the conditioning the rapturing condition of the world at the time that the rapture is to happen and the fact that the rapture itself the actual rapture taking place the body change and the and the going to meet the lord in the air this is that rapture message with a time of trouble god's going to hide me and has there ever been a greater trouble on the earth today i don't know that maybe uh there's ever been a greater trouble than what's going on in the world today and there's been some great troubles obviously god destroyed it one time with the flood right there's obviously been some very troubled times on this planet but i and i don't know but as far as at least the last 2 000 years since the death of christ there's probably been no harder time than there is you say well there was the dark ages but that was a a physical uh persecution of for spiritual reasons but the darkness of the world today is is so blacked out that again brother adam on the back wall when god wrote it on the black back wall of the tabernacle this age was completely blacked out right even during the dark ages it wasn't completely blacked out but in this day on the wall when god wrote it it was black completely black so think about that so at this time now satan's eating as bad as it is that god would take his bride now you can go to revelation 12 and see where god does the same thing to his to his children to the jews even amen god takes and hides them away well in this that david is talking about he said he will hide me in that time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion now the pavilion is a is a strange thing when i was reading this and when i hear the word pavilion it probably maybe strikes different things to you i think of of a park and a picnic cabana uh structure i've always we've always called those a pavilion that's in a park a big park where you have picnic tables and a structure over that's that's like a pavilion but if you look in the scripture so so it's like a a temporary structure that's there to to bring shelter a life like the like god like the wings of god the wings of god that come in and bring shelter a pavilion is more a place of shelter it's not neces it's not your place of abode it's not necessarily even a place that's of a temple that's been dedicated and consecrated and set aside for worship and all it's a place of shelter it's a place like being under the wings of god in that pavilion where he's talking about when when when trouble comes to try to find him god will hide him in this in this shelter in this place under the wings of god now i want to read a few of the scriptures too to bring this a little more to light but just think of that for a moment this these three structures that he's talking about and the all three serve a different purpose for a different reason amen but every one of them come about to help us understand all of it is in god right all of it's in christ every bit of these things is in is in christ which is where the bride is going to be in this last day before the rapture takes place she's going to be hid in christ amen in that pavilion in that shelter under his wings protected the time of trouble god will protect me hide me in that pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me the secret what does that mean that means that not everybody's going to know about it it's only going to be privy to those who are his that he reveals it to those that he shows it to a a tabernacle is a less permanent place of worship just like a temple is is uh just think about the tabernacle in the wilderness right the tabernacle in the wilderness god specifically built so that they could put it up and take it down and move it where and whenever they wanted to right as the holy spirit now now i hope you understand the spiritual application here when the holy spirit came as it did and it led the children of israel by a pillar of fire at night by a cloud by day as it led them along they had to be mobile enough to take their tabernacle and and draw it all together fold it all up and pack it and take it with them so they could follow god wherever he took them and then wherever god set them they'd set their tabernacle back home again and they had their place that they go into the inner court the outer court and then the holy sephony it was still a place of worship right but it was that progress that god the place that god had them to put that in there in that secret of the tabernacle that god's hiding us it's it's a place that not everybody knows about so if it's not everybody knows about it's not this building right amen because people know about this building i may not be a whole lot know about it now but they will eventually come to know in the city of tucson they'll know that this is a place that has a church in it they'll come to know that but this secret is a place that only god's chosen know about yeah right that it's revealed to them this is where you go so when you're in trouble where do you go when you're in need where do you go when you're in desperation where do you go amen you know where you go and god takes you and puts you in that place so even satan can't even get to you yeah right amen satan can't even get to you and he'll and he'll set me upon that rock and the rock of christ of course christ is the word amen all the way through this you can read you can see all the way through this that's where god sets us but now look what brother branham said here in the adoption in the adoption message number four i'll read the whole quote he said now remember we went through it this morning you wasn't saved by the blood you were kept saved by the blood but you were saved by grace through faith believing it god knocked at your heart's door because he predestinated you you looked up and believed it and accepted it and that's why he predestined because he knew you would believe it and accept it uh accept it now the blood makes atonement for your sins remember i said god does not condemn a sinner for sinning he's a sinner to begin with he condemns a christian for sinning and then because he has condemned him christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in in christ jesus right amen in christ jesus now david is saying all of this not realizing christ would come believing a messiah would come but not knowing who it was and the purpose and all david didn't know that he was uh he was writing his psalms and singing his psalms by inspiration of god to what was going down the road yeah what we experienced today as he was looking forward we look back and we realized what we can see now that's jesus christ that's the holy spirit that's god moving it so god became our condemnation when he died at calvary so there is no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus david didn't know he was talking about being in christ but we know that today that's our refuge that's our strength that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you do it you don't sin willfully a man sins willfully goes out willfully sins never comes into that body yet but a man that wants in there listen now a man that's once in there woman person once in there he's dead and his life is hidden in god through christ sealed by the holy ghost and the devil the devil can't even find him amen praise the lord you can be so lost in jesus christ you can be so hid in christ as david was speaking that satan can't even find you the devil can't even find you you saw the devils do this this the devil can only do what god allows him gets so deep into christ friend that he can't even fight amen do anything about it sealed by the holy ghost the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there he'll have to come out the person the man will have to come out before the devil can ever even get to him right praise the lord amen so lost satan can't even find him sow him as dead as david said so hid in that secret place that the enemy can't even find it when i'm in trouble when i'm distressed when an enemy comes up against me in the time of trouble god will set me upon that rock amen praise the lord that rock is christ and hide me so far in christ i can be so lost in jesus that satan can't even find amen praise the lord that's where i desire to be friend amen that's where i want to be so lost in christ satan can't find me now over in psalms 91 see how david follows this up we'll move past psalms 27 in our scripture reading but don't move past it for the rest of today or even maybe the next service or two keep in mind psalms 27 why brother branham used that as the rapture scripture amen the place that we were in and i'll show you before we leave here today my time's already getting away but before we leave here today i want to read that scripture even if it's just a portion of it because we'll follow back up with it maybe next time and and see where brother branham was taking this from amen now psalms 91 we'll see what david says here to follow this up psalms 91 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty sound kind of familiar praise the lord i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress there's another there's another habitation another dwelling place a fortress amen my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and utter his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day whatever arrow satan tries to pierce you with amen nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes us at noonday friend if i didn't think that david didn't have a revelation of what we were going to go through this past year i just i just don't know anything right a pestilence that walketh in darkness yeah i mean fred we've gone through it as a human uh species so many different pestilences and diseases and things yeah but you ever know the one that's been walking in the darkness seemingly like this one right even from its origin there's there's a whole half of our federal government that seems less than interested in even finding out where this thing came from talk about darkness talk about the the place where it came from that we know amen you want to talk about darkness oh goodness there is no liberty there the communist state news tells them what they want people to hear they're not going to tell you the truth i've always thought you know in my adult state i've always thought it was sort of comical when we as a country try to make these agreements with godless countries how can you make an agreement with a russia or china or iran when those people couldn't care it means absolutely nothing to them to lie to your face yeah nothing they couldn't care less there's no uh uh god there's no moral or there's no compass that says i gotta tell the truth to this man right it's not there yeah so if it's not there you're just dropping in darkness hoping thinking maybe they're going to do this that the other man it was born out of darkness right it hides in darkness where does the darkness come from that's not of god god is light the darkness is satan so if it's in darkness then you know it's of the devil this pestilence that comes in the darkness but where does god's sheltering us see as david said here under his wings amen god's protecting us and keeping us you remember the story brother branham told about that when he was uh up in the mountains and saw this eat his nest and little babies playing down and he said he heard the thunder uh roaring off in the distance he said as soon as that thing got close he heard that mama eagle lay out a stream and street and she come piercing down through there um however fast piercing down through there and she swooped down above those above the ground and those little eagle lifts just clamped onto her wings and she just pierced right up to that nest and took him up into safety amen my friend if that's not exactly the epitome of the scripture that david said here i don't know what it is amen that's beautiful and he said he saw this he actually personally this isn't something you read in the book printer song national geographic he saw this that eagle coming and picked them babies up they clamped onto her wings and then babies hanging on her wings she just pierced right back up to that nest again to keep them safe from the storm amen that's exactly what god's got for us that's who he is to us amen that was his illustration that was the point of it what god does for us pestilence walking in darkness but what it's not it's an arrow but it doesn't pierce us right amen that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes us at noon day a thousand shall fall at thy sight and ten at thy right side amen devils have no no chance friend but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked amen god will protect his own amen god takes his home too well i i know there's people that's that that's died from it well as far as i know people have died from cover yeah and i and i know maybe something to happen and and but i'll tell you this i still don't fear it i don't fear it right more than i do you tell brother brown cancer to brother green or as far as we know amen i don't ever know if there was a cause of death anybody know but uh we know it had cancer and he passed away but he passed away because it's god's time to take it right i was reading through these quotes and i was gonna print it but i didn't he said the devil wants to brother graham says the devil wants to take you but satan can't touch me until god is done with him amen well that's not just brother brown that applies to brother green that applies to you right amen so i don't fear cancer anymore and i fear the other yes right right amen i don't fear that doesn't scare me amen that's just a device fear is the device of the devil so it doesn't i don't fear of it any more than i do the other you know brother man wrote the book do you fear cancer because so many people were wracked with fear of cancer some people so much so that they actually begin to develop the symptoms of cancer even though they didn't have it just because they feared it so much and people do the same thing today i still see people i still see people walking down the street a thousand yards from the closest person with a mask on amen and they probably have they probably had their vaccine not an inoculation there's a difference mike has taught me that there's a difference in an inoculation in a vaccine your cellian is an inoculation but it's not right it's just a vaccine and these they probably had shots and they still walk down the street and that's their privilege that's fine i'm not belittling these people right at all understanding and the people that are living in fear and all that i'm not belittling those people because there can only live to what they have and what they know amen so i don't do that but but it helps us helps you understand what's going on remember we're talking about the resulting the condition in the world at the time of a rapture amen at the time of rapture what god is doing in this world today how things are unfolding now let's finish our thought here because i got to close i don't have to but colossians chapter 3 but i do want to finish this thought colossians chapter 3 verse 1. colossians 3 1. if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth right for ye are dead amen and your life is hid with christ in god now that's just exactly the quote we just read it's exactly what brother adam was saying i am dead you are dead we are dead and our life is hid with christ in god hid what does it mean to be hidden it means that nobody can find you or the person that you don't want to find you can't find it yeah as a kid he's played hide and go seek like you found a good hiding place they couldn't find you we had a big neighborhood it was dark kids hide all over the place you know you couldn't find them but it wasn't they they hid so you couldn't find them amen a little different now when i play hide and go seek with joel or emma you know i hide behind the door you know it's just pretty easy to find them not very many places to hide in a little apartment anyway but you know what i'm saying when you hide you hide where you can't be found that's the point god has the scripture here where he dead in him hid with christ in god amen caught up in heavenly places caught up yes when christ when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him where in glory amen we shall appear with him glory now i want to bring this this the story second kings chapter 6. second kings chapter six we all remember this story i used it as a reference here a few months ago of elisha at dothan and the syrian army the syrian king trying to come after elisha uh the king of syria sends down uh an army down to go capture elisha and try to get out of him what he did to bewitch the people to uh tell him his secrets of how he knows what the king's saying even in his bed chamber well we know what happens when the enemy gets there second kings chapter 6 verse 13. our reading begin with verse 13. and he said go and spy where he is that i may sin and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is independent therefore in heat there are horses and chariots and great hosts and they came by night could pass the city about and when the servant of the man of god was risen early gone forth behold the host compassed the city both with horses and chariots now you can see the scene they're sitting there elisha and servants and and the syrian army has come passed around about them all the way around no escape horses chariots capacity his servant said unto him alas my master what shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them right is that true today amen you better believe this yes if i can only give you one scriptural reference to help you understand forget about the power necessarily but the number the number of course the power obviously god outpowers the temple well it's not even comparable you can say darkness from light but that's not even comparable to how much power god has been saved but just think about the number if i could just give you a scripture reference just on number when satan deceived the angels of heaven he took one third that means it was 230 didn't deceive right so even if you just think scripturally of the deception of the comparison of the numbers angels that's that's two to one yeah amen that's a simple man fear not for they to be with us more than they would be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about a life and that's great you think wow that's wonderful the bow is on well they didn't even have to battle this was an easy battle so they got horses and chariots yeah but there's more of us with us than there are with them but they didn't even employ themselves look what god does and elijah god does through elijah and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite these people i pray thee with blindness and he spoke them with blindness according to the word of elijah and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom you seek but he led them to sumerian it came to pass when they were in samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men and that they may that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw behold there was they were in the midst of samaria it was that simple you say well there's more with us and they're all with them greater is he that said they but have just simply said god just blind their eyes when they get down here lord just have their eyes blinded and god blind in their eyes so that when they got down there where was uh where was elijah he was in a secret place he was hid away yes i say hid away in plain view right amen he was right there but they couldn't see him it's like the reference we talked about from the free real free will series when we talked about the blindness of israel god didn't purposely come and and smite them with and say okay you're not gonna see this they were so blinded by their preconceived notions of how they thought the messiah was going to come that when he come they dissed him right they couldn't see him he was hid in plain view elisha was hid in plain view you can be so hid in christ that satan can't even find you yes kid in plain view amen blind their eyes it's only to be revealed it's only for those who god chooses and if it's only for those who god chooses then what is there to worry about even when the enemy comes in even when the enemy compasses about god's blind their eyes eyes were blinded he said oh come on i'll show you who you're looking for even let them even let them to another to the next city he even said oh come on i'll show you yeah uh he and krumpus let's go out and show you they know who he was because they were blinded right amen let's go have a meal together let's go they didn't care didn't matter they were blind and then when he stood up to this city he went on out and he said okay god open around he opened their eyes and looked around and said how do we get here right because god hit it hit him and playing you right be so lost in christ satan can't find him satan can't find you yes amen or let me read you this amen my wife sent this to you reminded me of this by faith moses that's the title he said you know what i tell you that they was so true to god he's talking about israel moses until pharaoh got so excited at midnight he said get out just go get going get out of here take everything and go brother man said i am so glad that a man can live so close to god till the devil don't know what to do with him the devil don't even know what to do with him amen elisha said the devil come down to life she said uh god blamed him god blind come on i'll show you yeah just come on i'll show you where you just go down here let me just take you down there didn't even know what to do with open their eyes and they're like where how did we get here we had the man surrounded how did we get here because god what is the rapture and condition of the world today think of it what what is the scriptural rapture and condition does it compare to what's going on today does the condition of the world our country does it compare with scriptural references of what the bible says is going to be when the rapture takes place i'm going to read this real quick i'm going to read a couple of the verses here i'm not going to read as much as i was going to because i'm going to quote but after brother branham reads psalms 27 1-5 he gives a brief comment and then he goes right to this scripture now this is not a trivia class but you know where he went do you remember where the rapture messes where he went second peter second peter chapter three and i'm going to read just a couple of verses of scripture here because this follows up just like brother branham did in the rapture message this follows up what brother brown read in psalms 27 1-5 keep that in mind second peter 3. or read verse one through four second peter three one through four so glad say come around say you know you know she's trying to put that fear back on brother dennis too amen that doctor just something simple i mean people have things in their bodies and all you know but you see how that guy comes oh it's it's probably cancer again you got cancer you're going to go through the chemo set all this up nearly and you know you see how he's got to scare him it's just the devil he's just a devil amen second peter 3 1 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of our lord as the lord and savior knowing this first that this is where brother branham started now just after he reads psalms 27 1-5 he reads this knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation now we'll go through this whole chapter but we'll stop there and see where brother brown then majored on that word stoppers and he talked about the scoffers and those that were of that time when he was here 55 years ago this was preached 55 years ago 54 over 55 55 and a half years ago he preached this and the scoffers that there were look those scoffers that uh that would come in this last days walking after their own lust now if if that's not an example if that's not a an exact description of what we see and i'll just save this country at least because it probably gets rest world's probably worse of what's going on in this world today the sculptures you ever seen or heard the way it is today of the scoffers yes talk to people i've heard i've heard witnesses that brother tom's give me at the gym show where he tries to talk to people and they just scoff and laugh and make fun and put him down and oh how could you be so stupid how could you be so ignorant and of course laced with profanity right because most of these people don't know how to talk like a decent normal human being anymore oh where is he and there's nothing to that you people been saying that for year after year it's been so many years now my granddaddy said that my daddy said that and that was dedicated to where is it now and you go looking almost anywhere you go and it's the same thing and these and these scoffers these scoffers that that deny what we know is the truth not only are we hidden christ but the truth is hidden from those people right but this condition because again the direction that god gave brother branham for uh psalms 27 is the same god that gave him direction that a comment later to read this scripture so i believe that is something that we look to to understand what the world's condition will be like when the rapture takes place his coming at the resurrection of the dead and so then my question then are we there i believe we are are we completely there is a different story right amen i believe we're there absolutely there but i know brother adam said several times i see nothing less spiritual need to happen but the coming of the lord yes which includes of course the resurrection of the dead and the process that goes with that amen so if it was that waste 55 years ago what is it now and we look and see how much worse it's gotten friend and it's gotten to the place that if you don't accept because you know they're they're they're a hair of feathers width away from taking away the first amendment in this country if they do then it's all about thinking the way everybody else thinks and if you don't think the way they think you're the enemy and only to be left to be destroyed killed because you have no use if you don't think the way they think right amen that way of thinking satan's eden is of the devil right it's of the world yeah which is which is sets in the process for the tribulation so where are we because the bride leaves before the tribulation yeah rapture takes place which is another facet of what i want to get into of course the rapture is before the tribulation a lot of people don't even believe that even christians don't believe the rapture for the tribulation but if we see that condition and why brother branham preached that the way he did i believe it was for that time and i believe he preached it for that service and for those people he was gonna preach it at jack morris church and god held him off and had it come to yuma i don't know why they never know why but that was for a reason friend yeah and it brought it to that point to that place for a purpose and it was for us today i believe as much as it was then because i believe out of at that point at that time right now is the live and remain groups coming amen i believe that i believe we're that yeah whatever the lord that's right i i may not live to see it program said that too we may none of us i don't know maybe the little ones but it's here amen i believe i'm yes i believe i will i believe with that quote and i believe the conditions of the world today matches almost letter for letter and we'll there's more in there too of exactly what the scripture says it would be amen amen praise the thank god to give us a place of hiding yeah amen a place of hiding in him and a place to come into and get away from all that stay away from all the bible amen got a special prayer request too i'm closing here i want us to join together and pray and i don't mean just you know hear i just mean in prayer together that god rid us of that place next door they just moved down at the same time we're moving in a tattoo parlor's moving in next door so we we got some warrior faith to break out amen to get rid of that place amen i believe you can do it you oh yeah absolutely amen me and my parents when i was growing up uh we were in a little storefront like this three or four units and uh a like a bar or sports drill or something was next door and smoke would come through the walls and it stumps the bag and it was loud and things of course these these were kind of pentecostal people so the loud thing didn't bother very much i think we were always louder than the bar was but uh but we prayed about it we got together joined in faith and what long that place is gone yeah i believe god do the same thing here i don't care if he's just moved in don't care place over here is in but that's just that's just another one of those things about it people have gotten so washed down they they don't even see things like that as being undogging that that doesn't mean anything people go to all kinds of churches and they're just just desecrated the temple of god you know with all that they don't see anything wrong with that it doesn't mean anything to them amen but we do we know that there is the spirits that come with that amen amen is let's see this course of this well we'll see the course we'll see i don't know that's the wrong one forgive me 5 23 amen let's see this little course worship the lord a little bit before we let you go today pray the lord bless us with some more rain today too amen thankful god's blessed us so much been so dry just love seeing the desert get the beautiful dose of rain 5 23. this is the bride is preparing now for her lord to me [Music] all things are [Music] there's darkness throughout this land [Music] this world just can't understand [Music] if you would be saved and follow the words he gave [Music] the is is preparing now for her lord all things [Music] oh [Music] the different ways the scripture says it in the last days amen i believe we're here yes i believe that rapturing time is just at hand frame yes you feel that change feel that pull see those signs recognize what's going on around us whether i or any of us live to see it friend it's here amen and i for one am ready to go home yes yes praise the lord ready to go home i'm so thankful god give us the promise of his word where we're headed what's happening for us god is just so good to us thank you the lord for his word and for the promises he gives amen the other thing i meant to ask you uh and in the back especially can you hear okay great did you hear zach okay yes i just heard him in the music in the bathroom praise the lord thank you i just wanted to uh i just wanted to make sure we're talking about getting some amplification but um and we want to get some streaming equipment there's a lot of things we want to try to do but um
