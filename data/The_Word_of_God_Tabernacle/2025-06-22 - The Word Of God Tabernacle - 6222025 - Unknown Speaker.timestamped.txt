[21:10] coming this morning, but uh we uh I have
[21:13] one prayer request uh to mention to you
[21:15] today. Amen. Brother Dennis and brother
[21:18] Danny uh are not with us today. Both had
[21:21] difficulty falling asleep last night. Uh
[21:24] Dennis uh said he had some neurop
[21:27] uropathy in his left foot as well. So he
[21:29] was in some pain. He texted me about
[21:31] 4:30 and said that he was having this
[21:34] pain and having a hard time falling
[21:36] asleep. Their brother Frankie passed
[21:39] away. Uh their brother Frankie was a
[21:42] Catholic priest and I know it it grieved
[21:46] brother Dennis pretty severely.
[21:48] I saw him about it the other day and we
[21:50] had lunch together. But please remember
[21:52] them in prayer if you would. Brother
[21:53] Dennis, brother Danny, the family.
[21:55] Actually, Dennis said that their sister
[21:57] Arlene's probably taking it harder than
[22:00] anybody in the family. So, thank you
[22:02] them in prayer to the Katy family and
[22:05] the Lord would just come with them and
[22:07] be with them during this time. So, I had
[22:10] not heard about it till this morning.
[22:12] Uh, so I did not know until brother
[22:14] Dennis text me early this morning. So,
[22:16] amen. Please remember them in prayer if
[22:18] you would. Amen. Anyone else have a a
[22:21] prayer request? Just remember those who
[22:22] are here. Sister Lydia with us. is still
[22:25] in the mountains. Remember them. Sister
[22:27] Karen, brother Tom, and then Sister
[22:29] Norma, as far as I know, is coming. My
[22:31] wife's coming. My wife's still
[22:33] struggling with her back. So, remember
[22:35] her in prayer. Uh she's probably having
[22:37] a little little struggle getting ready
[22:39] this morning, I'm guess. And she brought
[22:41] me into church this morning. We only
[22:42] have one vehicle now. Uh so, she brought
[22:45] me into church this morning, went back
[22:46] home. So, she's up. Uh she just uh I
[22:50] know she's just dealing with her back.
[22:52] remember of course good to see us. Who
[22:56] did you bring with you today?
[22:58] That's our granddaughter Madison.
[23:01] Madison, welcome Madison. It's good to

[23:12] Julie, of course. Anyone else have a
[23:14] prayer request?
[23:19] Please remember if you would uh we're
[23:22] I'm flying out early earlier than normal
[23:24] uh today 12:55 so I'll be scooting
[23:27] really quick after church today so
[23:29] please forgive me for that um you're
[23:32] supposed to be at the airport two hours
[23:33] early that doesn't happen but
[23:35] fortunately living in Tucson it's pretty
[23:37] small airport so I'm usually uh with the
[23:40] priority check in and TSA pre-check I'm
[23:43] usually in the I'm usually out of the
[23:45] car into the gate five minutes so uh
[23:48] usually an is good, but we need to get
[23:50] going pretty quick. But uh I appreciate
[23:52] your prayers for safe travel and good

[25:42] passed but uh we just of course want to

[32:34] this word to us, Lord, and let it be a
[32:36] revelation to each of our hearts and see
[32:38] and hear what you'd have us to know,
[32:39] God. We know that your word will not
[32:42] return void, but accomplish in it that
[32:44] that you'd sent it forth for, whatever
[32:46] it may be today, God. for whoever may be
[32:48] watching, whoever may be here,
[32:50] listening, God, whoever may hear it in
[32:51] the future. Lord, let it accomplish in
[32:54] them and each of us what you sent it
[32:57] forth for the purpose, God, that you
[32:59] have for it for us today. Lord, we know
[33:02] in ourselves, we are insufficient just
[33:04] trusting and believing in you for all
[33:06] things, God. May you bless and
[33:09] strengthen us now, God, as we commit
[33:10] ourselves into your hands and ask these
[33:13] blessings in the precious, holy, lovely
[33:15] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[33:16] Christ. Amen.
[33:19] Amen. Romans chapter 8, I begin reading
[33:22] with verse 14 again. Amen. Romans 8:14.
[33:27] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[33:29] God, they are the sons of God. For you
[33:31] have not received the spirit of bondage
[33:33] again to fear, but you have received the
[33:34] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba,
[33:37] father. The spirit itself beareth
[33:40] witness with our spirit that we are the
[33:43] children of God. And if children, then
[33:45] hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If
[33:49] so be that we suffer with him, that we
[33:51] may also be also glorified together.
[33:55] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like.
[34:02] Amen. Last week we were getting into the
[34:04] first uh installment or the first uh
[34:07] part of our position in Christ which is
[34:10] what adoption is about. So last week we
[34:13] spoke on the our position in Christ part
[34:16] one. So this would be adoption actually
[34:18] part 18 uh our position in Christ part
[34:21] two. Amen. Praise the Lord. So I want to
[34:24] go over to another scripture if we can.
[34:27] And we read last week first uh second
[34:29] Peter chapter 1. I just want to read
[34:31] this uh one verse of scripture again if
[34:34] we could. Second Peter chapter 1 verse
[34:37] 10
[34:38] uh as we take the scripture to dive back
[34:41] into kind of where we try to pick up
[34:43] where we left off last week.
[34:46] Background a little bit from where we
[34:48] were last week as well. So second Peter
[34:51] chapter 1 verse 10. Second Peter 1:10.
[34:55] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[34:57] diligence to make your calling and
[35:00] election sure. For if you do these
[35:03] things, you shall never fall. You shall
[35:05] never fall. If you do these, make your
[35:07] calling and election sure. Calling is to
[35:11] be called uh your election is chosen.
[35:14] Handpicked. God handpicked you. Amen.
[35:17] When God elected you, he handpicked you.
[35:18] He chose you from before the foundation
[35:20] of the world. He was part of him in God
[35:23] before the foundation world. You were
[35:25] amen that portion of the Bible. God put
[35:27] that seed in you. Amen. As you were
[35:29] born, that was that seed that was in you
[35:31] was to become you even before the
[35:33] foundation of the world. That seed that
[35:35] comes to maturity in yourself now is
[35:38] that is that new birth that the Holy
[35:40] Spirit, God himself living in you is is
[35:43] that part of you who God is. And
[35:45] remember, God is God is the only thing
[35:48] that's eternal. Amen. And if we ever
[35:50] have or expect to have eternal life, we
[35:52] have to understand that that part of our
[35:54] life, who we are, that's eternal, is
[35:56] God. Amen. And that's what rules our
[35:59] lives. That's that's who we are. That's
[36:00] the spirit that's within us that shows
[36:02] us and leads us and guides us and tells
[36:05] us what to do and how to live and where
[36:06] to go. And that's our whole life. Amen.
[36:08] Is being led by the Holy Spirit. But our
[36:11] calling in election to make sure you
[36:12] understand what our calling is. It's not
[36:15] just so much being a part of the body of
[36:17] Christ. It's the calling of the position
[36:20] that you play that you are placed in in
[36:22] that body. Your calling or position in
[36:25] that body. Amen. Everybody has their own
[36:27] part to play. Uh not just the five-fold
[36:30] ministry, not just ministers themselves,
[36:32] but everyone that's a part of the body
[36:34] of Christ has their own part to play
[36:36] within that body of Christ. And as we
[36:38] said last week, God molds you, makes
[36:40] you, shapes you, uh your birth forth,
[36:43] you're brought forth, your the place you
[36:45] live, your parents you had, the friends
[36:47] you had, the schools you went to,
[36:49] everything that you were privy to in
[36:51] your uh for pretty much your entire life
[36:54] was to groom you to the place that you
[36:56] were to be to to fulfill the position
[36:59] that God wants you in. Uh, one of the
[37:02] I've said this before, but one of the
[37:04] greatest selling Christian books that
[37:06] there ever has been written was uh, a
[37:08] man wrote a book called Purpose-Driven
[37:11] Life. Amen. A lot of people have read
[37:13] that book. I personally uh, have never
[37:15] had it or read it, but I know it became
[37:17] a very popular book. A lot of people
[37:19] because a lot of people just flounder
[37:21] through in life and don't know what
[37:23] their purpose is, don't know what
[37:25] they're called to. Uh, I think a lot of
[37:27] that, as I said last week, probably has
[37:29] a lot to do with a lot of the homeless
[37:31] that we have today. And people that just
[37:33] aimless, purposeless. They don't know
[37:35] why they're here. They don't know what
[37:36] they're supposed to do. They don't know
[37:37] what their calling is. Uh, whether
[37:39] they're Christian or not, don't know
[37:40] what they're supposed to be doing. They
[37:42] just So, a lot of people just give up on
[37:44] life and just quit or just uh don't
[37:48] don't find any purpose to life. Uh, when
[37:50] you don't have a purpose, then what good
[37:52] is life? Uh it's like I've said many
[37:55] times, uh when the purpose that God has
[37:58] for me is fulfilled, then I'm ready to
[38:00] go home whenever God calls me. When that
[38:02] purpose is finished, when that purpose
[38:04] is fulfilled, well, we all have a
[38:06] purpose. Every one of us have a purpose.
[38:10] I think one of the hardest things
[38:12] especially for young people is they grow
[38:14] up and go to school and are raised in
[38:16] certain homes with certain families and
[38:18] parents and things uh and have friends
[38:21] that that that they need purpose. They
[38:23] need to feel like they belong. They need
[38:25] that's why that that's why gangs become
[38:28] so popular. That's why peer pressure is
[38:31] so is so prevalent because people want
[38:35] to feel like they belong. They want to
[38:37] be a part of something. They wanna they
[38:39] want to play a part. Amen. It it it it's
[38:42] like a baseball team. Uh when when you
[38:44] when you play baseball, every every
[38:47] position has its part to play. Amen.
[38:50] There's uh if I remember right, I think
[38:53] there's nine positions on the baseball
[38:55] field. Uh and everybody has a part. Not
[38:57] everybody can be the pitcher. Everybody
[39:00] wants to be the pitcher. At least when I
[39:01] was growing up and I was a kid,
[39:03] everybody wanted to be the pitcher. But
[39:05] everybody can be the pitcher. And when I
[39:07] was growing up, nobody wanted to be the
[39:09] catcher, but somebody had to be the
[39:11] catcher. Nobody wanted to do it, but
[39:14] somebody had to do it because there had
[39:16] to be that person that's behind the
[39:18] plate to catch what the pitcher threw.
[39:21] not realizing that the pitcher and the
[39:23] catcher are probably two of the more
[39:26] important people on the field,
[39:27] especially the catcher because he
[39:30] touches the ball almost every single
[39:32] play. Every single time that something
[39:36] happens, the the catcher is a part of
[39:37] it. Amen. Every pitch, unless the batter
[39:40] hits it, the catcher catches the ball.
[39:43] Amen. What does he do with it? So, every
[39:45] part of it is important. Now, if you hit
[39:48] it to one part of the field, that guy
[39:50] catches it. Well, yeah, that's good. But
[39:52] what if he just holds on to the ball?
[39:54] No, there's another guy over on first
[39:56] base that's there to catch the ball when
[39:57] he throws it. Amen. And they have to
[40:00] work together. They have to be there as
[40:02] as a part of a team. And they feel a
[40:05] part of the team. Amen. Even a good
[40:07] coach even will make those guys or
[40:12] girls, whatever it is, but they'll make
[40:14] those guys who who aren't very good or
[40:17] they're young or they're learning who
[40:19] have to sit on the bench and can't be
[40:21] out on the field. A good coach will make
[40:24] that even the ones riding the bench be a
[40:26] part of the team. Amen. A good coach
[40:29] will will make sure those that are
[40:31] riding the bench are part of the team
[40:32] and feel a part of the team and feel
[40:35] just as important as if they caught that
[40:38] uh uh ball in center field to end the
[40:41] game to win the game. He'll make them
[40:43] feel just as important. See, and that's
[40:46] what God does when you give your life to
[40:48] the Lord. He'll make no matter what
[40:49] position, whatever part you play, God
[40:52] will make it sure that you play that
[40:55] part and feel just as important as as
[40:59] whoever the person the the pastor or the
[41:01] person out in front or the person that
[41:03] seems like to be the most important. And
[41:05] I know when I was uh just uh cutting my
[41:08] teeth, I guess you will, and started
[41:10] ministering, so many of the younger
[41:12] brothers, they all wanted to minister.
[41:14] They all wanted to preach. And and not
[41:17] everybody's called to preach, right? Not
[41:19] not everybody's called to minister. And
[41:22] then everybody all of them kind of tend
[41:24] to that lack like they want to all be
[41:26] pastors. Like why do you all want to be
[41:28] pastors? Amen. That that's that's
[41:32] probably one of the hardest positions
[41:34] there are to fulfill in the ministry of
[41:37] the gospel is to be a pastor. Amen. If
[41:41] you're an evangelist, uh, you just
[41:43] strolling off the street, burn the
[41:44] congregation up, and hit the road. I
[41:47] mean, that sounds a lot easier to me.
[41:49] You just come into a place and you just
[41:52] you tear the height off the people and
[41:54] you hit the road. That's what an
[41:56] evangelist does. He's evangelizing, stir
[41:59] the people up, and then he's gone. Amen.
[42:01] There's nothing left. There's no
[42:03] responsibility. There's none of this and
[42:05] that of taking care of the spiritual
[42:07] welfare of the people and that kind of
[42:08] thing. But everybody wanted to be a
[42:10] pastor. What do you want to be a pastor
[42:11] for? Amen. Now me, I knew what God
[42:15] called me to do. And I couldn't escape
[42:16] it no matter what you do. Amen. No
[42:18] matter how hard you try. But we got to
[42:20] make sure that our calling and election
[42:23] is sure. Cuz if you're in your calling,
[42:26] you can't fall because God will bless
[42:27] you. As we said last week, God will
[42:29] bless you in that call. If you're
[42:31] fulfilling the position that God's put
[42:34] you in, amen. Then God will bless you in
[42:37] that position. God will help you. Like
[42:39] we said last week, by the spirit of
[42:41] adoption, the Holy Spirit of adoption,
[42:44] that adoption is not putting you in the
[42:46] family. It's placing in your position in
[42:48] that family. And God will make sure that
[42:50] that Holy Spirit reveals to you, shows
[42:54] you, leads you, puts you in the position
[42:56] that you should be in to fulfill. And
[42:58] when you're in that position, God will
[43:00] bless you in that position. God will
[43:03] make sure that you are blessed. Amen.
[43:05] So, uh, as we said last week, we have,
[43:08] uh, these three parts that we look at of
[43:11] adoption, the three stages. The
[43:13] placement in the body. Your adoption is
[43:16] the placement in the body. Your abiding
[43:19] in that call, which we might get to a
[43:21] scripture that I want to read uh, in
[43:24] reference to that today, maybe next
[43:25] week. We'll see. But abiding in that
[43:28] call, living in that call. See, we can't
[43:31] you can't despise what God's called you
[43:34] to do. Don't don't reject what God's
[43:36] called you to do. Don't don't try to
[43:39] carnally impersonate somebody else.
[43:42] Amen. And become that person or preach
[43:45] like that person or fulfill that
[43:47] person's responsibility. That's that
[43:49] that's God to do in a person's life, not
[43:52] for you. You fulfill the purpose God's
[43:54] given you. Amen. Whatever it is, God you
[43:57] fulfill abiding in that call. Amen. And
[44:01] then we have the culmination, the body
[44:03] change. The end of adoption, in my
[44:05] opinion, the end of the adoption is in
[44:07] the body change when the Lord takes us
[44:09] home to be with him in a rapture or uh
[44:12] well, we all rapture. Even if we go by
[44:14] the way of the grave, we all rapture.
[44:16] Amen. So, it's being called, placed in
[44:20] that body, living in that call, live
[44:22] your life in your calling. Because we
[44:25] just read, if you live in that call, you
[44:27] can't fall. You will not fall. period.
[44:30] God will make sure to be there to lift
[44:32] you up to bless you. Doesn't mean it's
[44:34] going to be easy. Amen. But God will
[44:37] bless you in it. Then the culmination of
[44:38] course is uh when we go when the Lord
[44:41] takes us home in a rapture. Now let me
[44:42] read these couple of things.
[44:46] Adoption series 1960. This is part one
[44:49] of adoption. As you may know, when
[44:51] brother Brandham preached on adoption,
[44:53] he had it in several parts. uh not as
[44:56] many as we have, but uh brother Brandham
[44:58] had a limited amount of time. Uh by
[45:01] God's grace, I can come in here week to
[45:03] week and give little snippets of every
[45:05] part and kind of dig a little deeper
[45:07] than brother Brandham did. So, but let
[45:09] me read this to you now. Uh who could do
[45:12] that? That's what Paul said. That's
[45:14] Paul's scripture. That's Paul's writing.
[45:15] That's what he taught his church. The
[45:17] church positionally, listen now, the
[45:20] church positionally before the
[45:23] foundation of the world when God is in
[45:25] his labor pains was bringing forth
[45:28] bringing you forth. Amen. In that
[45:32] creation and bringing you forth, knowing
[45:36] what you would do, God knowing what you
[45:39] would do. Again, that's why God brought
[45:42] you forth in the home that you were born
[45:44] in, with the parents you were born to,
[45:47] in the house that you were born in, in
[45:49] the generation that you were born in, in
[45:52] the city that you were born in, in the
[45:54] state that you were born in, in the f in
[45:56] the schools that you went to, in the
[45:58] friends that you had at school in
[46:00] different places. Every single thing
[46:02] about your life, God was grooming you to
[46:05] bring you to that place that you can
[46:07] fulfill that position. Amen. Everybody
[46:11] to fill to fulfill that position and not
[46:14] just fulfill that position because
[46:17] there's a lot of pastors. We'll just go
[46:19] the easy road. Uh or there's a lot of
[46:22] mothers. Amen. Let's forget about the
[46:25] ministry. There's a lot of mothers.
[46:28] Amen. But not every mother was meant to
[46:31] mother everybody's child.
[46:35] God gives that mother that child because
[46:37] God ordained that mother for that child.
[46:40] Amen. There was no other mother supposed
[46:43] to mother that child. That child was
[46:45] supposed to be mothered by the mother
[46:46] God gave her to. Amen. Just like there's
[46:51] plenty of pastors. There's a lot of
[46:52] pastors God calls I'm not the only
[46:55] pastor in the world. God calls uh
[46:58] there's hundreds or thousands of men
[47:00] that would fulfill the purpose of uh of
[47:03] being pastor. Amen. But there was only
[47:06] one that called uh to be here in this
[47:09] place right now for this purpose with
[47:12] you people right here. He didn't call
[47:15] everybody to be here right now. He
[47:17] called another brother because he needed
[47:19] to be in that church down here for the
[47:21] people that are there. And God grooved
[47:24] him and shaped him and everything that
[47:27] he did to bring his life to the place
[47:29] that he would be the pastor that those
[47:31] people need. Yeah. And God leads the
[47:34] people not by popularity contest, not by
[47:39] what a great ortor or how good-looking a
[47:42] man might be or if he's a family member.
[47:45] Makes no difference. Yes. God leads his
[47:48] children and sends them where he wants
[47:50] them to be to set under the pastor that
[47:54] he grew them to be from their birth.
[47:58] Amen. And now you've got the
[47:59] combination. And now God can operate in
[48:02] a group like that. Friends, Amen.
[48:05] problem you get to is if you get a
[48:07] person who's not supposed to be
[48:08] ministering or not supposed to be
[48:09] pastoring, you get people who follow
[48:12] favoritism and because someone's a good
[48:14] orator, he's uh he's really uh emotional
[48:19] or something or or whatever it might be,
[48:21] a trait or something that someone's
[48:23] well, he's good-looking, and they go to
[48:25] that church instead. Oh, well, my
[48:26] family's been going there and you know,
[48:28] it's kind of like politics or
[48:30] denomination. Well, my great great great
[48:31] great great granddaddy was a Baptist and
[48:33] I guess I was born a Baptist. I'll die a
[48:35] Baptist.
[48:37] Well, my great great great grandpa, he
[48:39] was a Democrat, Republican, whatever.
[48:41] So, I guess I'll always be regardless of
[48:43] what happens, regardless of if it's
[48:45] right, wrong, or indifferent. You know,
[48:46] that's the attitude people take. Oh, my
[48:49] family goes there or whatever it is.
[48:51] That has nothing to do with it. You
[48:54] know, you go where God sends you. Amen.
[48:58] You be where God places you because
[49:01] God's got if you're a child of God,
[49:03] God's got the exact perfect pastor that
[49:05] you're supposed to sit under.
[49:08] Amen. He does. And and if you're led of
[49:12] God, if he's led of God and you're led
[49:15] of God, that's a combination, friend.
[49:18] That's a combination that'll work. Then
[49:19] God can do something with that. God can
[49:22] move in that place. God can move in that
[49:24] congregation. God can move on those
[49:26] people. God can make a difference in our
[49:29] lives. And we can see it happening when
[49:31] those things come together because every
[49:33] bit of it is in the spirit of the Holy
[49:36] Ghost. And then you can see the Holy
[49:38] Spirit moving in that because God
[49:40] orchestrated that in his mind knowing
[49:43] what you would do before the foundation
[49:46] of the world. God saw that. Amen. And he
[49:49] put you here. But wherever. Amen.
[49:52] Whoever we are, God does all that for a
[49:54] reason. There's a purpose behind where
[49:57] who we are and where we're supposed to
[49:59] be. Yeah. You just say, "Well, there's
[50:02] all kinds of churches." Yeah, there are.
[50:03] But there's only one where you're
[50:05] supposed to be. Yeah. Oh, there's all
[50:06] kinds of pastors. Yeah, there are. But
[50:08] there's only one pastor that God's
[50:10] called you to sit under. Amen. Now, it
[50:13] could be different stages of life. Amen.
[50:16] Maybe like we said last week, uh there
[50:19] there might be a pastor that's that's a
[50:22] little more uh adept at ministry. H his
[50:25] ministry is more geared toward uh young
[50:28] people that come in or uh people that
[50:30] are just coming in off the street or
[50:32] those who have just came into the
[50:35] message and just want to learn the
[50:36] fundamentals to start out. There's
[50:38] there's pastors that that that is really
[50:41] their ministry and they're good at it
[50:43] and God's called them to do that and
[50:45] God's blessed them in it. And then
[50:47] there's others that are more adept to
[50:49] ministering to more seasoned people and
[50:52] people that have been in the message for
[50:54] years or know the scripture or know the
[50:56] message or know who they are. And
[50:57] there's and there's those that God sends
[51:00] for that purpose. And maybe uh maybe a
[51:03] person uh is under a minister for a
[51:06] while and they've learned the
[51:07] fundamentals. They've got the Holy
[51:09] Spirit and they've moved in this they've
[51:11] grown in grace in the Lord and they've
[51:13] got to the place that uh a a pastor just
[51:18] continuing to minister to the ones that
[51:20] are just coming in isn't satisfying to
[51:23] that person anymore. Maybe they need to
[51:24] grow a little more. And God will have
[51:26] someone else, maybe another pastor for
[51:28] them to set under to continue to bring
[51:30] them up in the word, to continue to help
[51:33] them to grow in the word. Amen. So, I'm
[51:37] not saying because uh God has put a
[51:40] specific pastor that you're with that
[51:42] that pastor all of your life. That
[51:45] doesn't. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it
[51:47] doesn't. Amen. But it's up to God. You
[51:50] go where God leads you. That's why
[51:53] anybody that's ever left any church that
[51:56] I pastored, I tell them, you do what God
[51:59] tells you to do. But you better make
[52:02] sure it's God. That's only caveat.
[52:07] Just make sure that it's God leading you
[52:10] because the devil's always there to try
[52:12] to stir everything up and mess it up and
[52:14] change it and make everything in the way
[52:16] it's not not not supposed to be. Amen.
[52:19] But God bringing you forth in his labor
[52:22] pains, bringing you forth, knowing what
[52:24] you would do. He positionally placed you
[52:28] into his own body. Praise the Lord.
[52:31] Knowing what you would do. See, so we're
[52:35] not just dealing with adoption in this.
[52:37] We're also dealing with preh
[52:39] pre-ordination or uh predestination.
[52:42] Amen. Or fornowledge.
[52:44] God knew. Thus he predestined.
[52:47] Thus knowing what you do, he placed you
[52:50] in his own body
[52:52] to be a housewife, to be a farmer, to be
[52:56] a preacher, to be a prophet, to be this
[52:58] or that or whatever it is. He placed you
[53:01] placed you positionally.
[53:04] Amen. Where he wants you to be, where
[53:06] it's going to work in his body so that
[53:10] every bit of what we do comes to glorify
[53:14] and magnify Jesus Christ.
[53:18] our whole lives. The purpose that we
[53:20] have, the purpose that we serve, why God
[53:23] has us here is to live for him. Amen.
[53:27] It's not to get rich. It's not to have
[53:28] big houses. It's not to be popular, have
[53:30] great fame. It's not to become some
[53:33] great person or some great writer or
[53:34] whatever it might be.
[53:37] It's to live for Jesus Christ. Yeah.
[53:39] Now, if living for Jesus Christ, you uh
[53:42] God blesses you in with an accumulation
[53:44] of finances, that's fine. There's
[53:46] nothing wrong with that. Not a thing in
[53:48] the world wrong with that. In fact, God
[53:50] a lot of times needs those people to
[53:53] help fund the things that God's doing,
[53:54] right? That God's working in. Amen. So,
[53:58] people try to make that sound like a
[54:01] negative. No, it's not. Amen. And but
[54:04] see, the the problem comes in there then
[54:07] where everybody then wants to be rich.
[54:10] I I want to have all that money. I want
[54:13] to be the person that has all that great
[54:15] notoriety. I want to be that. But you
[54:17] know, God gives it to the person he
[54:18] knows can handle it, right? Amen. Maybe
[54:21] why I don't have any. But he gives it to
[54:24] the person he knows who can handle it.
[54:26] Praise the Lord. And that's and that's
[54:28] important in the body of Christ. Amen. I
[54:32] remember I I'll tell you a story because
[54:34] brother Green keeps coming to my mind
[54:36] because he is the greatest example of
[54:37] anybody I know honestly as far as when
[54:40] it comes to money. Everybody thought he
[54:42] was a millionaire rich and all this
[54:43] stuff. I remember he had a little uh he
[54:46] had a little Swiss cheese or something
[54:48] on his desk uh with with a dollar in it
[54:51] or something. I forgot what it was. May
[54:53] have been play money. I don't remember.
[54:54] It's been a long time ago. So he had he
[54:57] said everybody he has this Swiss bank
[54:59] account. He said that's his Swiss bank
[55:00] account. He had a little ceramic Swiss
[55:04] cheese or something with a dollar.
[55:06] That's my Swiss bank account. Everybody
[55:08] thought he had all this money. But I
[55:10] remember one time, I'll just tell this.
[55:12] I remember one time when brother Rand
[55:15] was brother sitting there and he's going
[55:17] through uh letters and of course people
[55:20] send their tithes in mailing in and
[55:22] stuff like that and one sent in uh I
[55:25] think it was well he's gone so I don't
[55:28] guess it was a $10,000 check and he put
[55:31] it over and he was talking to another
[55:33] brother. I won't call his name, but he
[55:35] was talking to another brother and they
[55:37] were trying to upgrade this in the
[55:38] church and stuff. And brother and the
[55:40] brother was reluctant to tell brother
[55:43] Green how much it was going to cost to
[55:46] do this upgrade that he was wanting to
[55:47] do. And brother Green asked him said and
[55:50] and may have asked him a couple times if
[55:52] I remember right. He asked him how much
[55:54] is it going to cost? And the brother
[55:56] finally said, "Well, Brother Green is is
[55:59] it's u it's going to cost like $10,000."
[56:04] Brother Green took that tithe ticket,
[56:05] just came in and handed it to him. Said,
[56:06] "There you go. Get it done."
[56:11] It just just that easy. Amen.
[56:15] No, let's go do this or that. No, it's
[56:18] just God provide the money. There it is.
[56:20] There, let's do it. Amen. That's just
[56:23] the kind of person he was. Amen. Come
[56:26] in, went out. And anyway, greatest
[56:30] example of somebody I know in that
[56:31] position. See, didn't everybody people
[56:33] get jealous then? And everybody wants to
[56:35] be the rich person. But let me read you
[56:37] this story. Just like everybody want to
[56:39] be the catcher or the pitcher, excuse
[56:41] me. Nobody want to be the catcher.
[56:43] Everybody want to be the pitcher. And
[56:45] when I was growing up, baseball,
[56:46] everybody want to be the preacher.
[56:48] Everybody wants to be the pastor, the
[56:49] person that stands up and the one that
[56:51] gets the no. Yeah. Have you heard of
[56:53] this brother? Yeah. Well, he's in his
[56:55] congregation. Nobody know anybody in the
[56:56] congregation.
[56:58] I don't know how many times I've gone to
[57:00] places and ministered for largeations
[57:03] like brother Tim when we used to go over
[57:05] there and minister and we my wife and my
[57:07] mom into a restaurant and sit down and
[57:10] eat and people come up and shake our
[57:12] hand doing his goodness. That was
[57:14] wonderful service. Good to meet you blah
[57:16] blah blah. And I'm like who are you? I
[57:20] don't know who they are. So, well, I
[57:21] probably should introduce myself.
[57:23] brother said, "Oh, okay. All right." You
[57:25] know, because they're kind of, you know,
[57:28] more the congregation is sort of more in
[57:31] obscurity. People know the congregation
[57:33] like they do the pastor, the minister
[57:36] comes up. So, everybody wants to be the
[57:38] minister. Every be the picture. But look
[57:40] at this.
[57:42] Victory Day 1963. Brother Brandham tells
[57:45] the story of Dwight Moody.
[57:48] Look at Dwight Moody's conference uh
[57:51] conversion.
[57:52] Now we're talking about position in
[57:54] Christ. So remember that adoption
[57:56] position in Christ. Look at Dwight
[57:58] Moody's conversion. Any of those you see
[58:01] just one little wash woman, a little
[58:05] wash woman with a message on her heart
[58:08] to do something for God.
[58:11] She had in her heart to do something for
[58:13] God. Just a wash woman. Maybe made 50
[58:16] cent a week washing clothes. Now who
[58:18] wants to be the little wash woman? Who
[58:21] wants to spend their lives raise their
[58:23] money beating clothes against a rock
[58:27] or against the uh the board? I forgot
[58:31] what it's the run up. Who wants to be
[58:34] that person? Nobody wants to be that
[58:36] person. But there's got to be somebody
[58:38] to fulfill that position. Of course,
[58:40] nowadays you just go to the machine,
[58:42] push a button, but nobody wants to be
[58:45] that person. Just like nobody wanted to
[58:47] be the catcher. Nobody wants to be the
[58:50] janitor. Amen. Nobody. Hardly anybody
[58:54] wants to be the person that's considered
[58:57] the bottom of the totem pole.
[59:00] But I believe it was David said, "I'd
[59:03] rather be a doormat in the house of
[59:04] God." Amen.
[59:08] But look, this little wash woman he's
[59:10] talking about, she had something in her
[59:12] heart washing clothes 50 cent a week,
[59:14] whatever it was, but she had something
[59:16] that she wanted to do for God.
[59:19] And so she rented an old library stable
[59:22] and got a minister to come down and
[59:24] preach.
[59:26] And nobody but a little boy with hair
[59:30] hanging down the back of his neck and
[59:32] with his daddy suspenders on went down
[59:35] to that altar.
[59:37] He went down. Dwight Moody went down and
[59:40] knelt at that altar and gave his heart
[59:42] to Jesus Christ that night. And that
[59:44] little boy turned out to be Dwight who
[59:47] led half a million souls to Jesus
[59:50] Christ.
[59:52] Who's going to get the credit for that
[59:53] half a million souls?
[59:55] That little wash woman who had something
[59:58] her heart to do for God. 50 cent a week.
[1:00:02] There's no telling how much library ster
[1:00:06] needed to be paid. We don't know. Amen.
[1:00:09] But that little boy came down to the
[1:00:11] altar. You know what? She had three or
[1:00:13] four nights service when she had that
[1:00:15] stable and she had that minister come
[1:00:17] in, but she funded it. She paid for it
[1:00:19] out of what me mere meek uh uh uh income
[1:00:24] that she made. Amen. And he came down to
[1:00:27] the altar and he was just a little boy.
[1:00:30] We know the rest of the story.
[1:00:32] I don't even know if this woman that
[1:00:34] little boy was white booty or not. But
[1:00:37] you know what she did? She had something
[1:00:39] on her heart to do for God. So she
[1:00:41] rented this library stable. She got this
[1:00:43] preacher to come in and one boy, one
[1:00:45] person came and gave his heart to Jesus
[1:00:47] Christ was Dwight Booty. But you know
[1:00:49] what she did? She went back to being a
[1:00:53] little wash woman.
[1:00:55] Amen. Maybe the rest of her life. We
[1:00:58] don't know about the rest of her story.
[1:01:00] Maybe she just she went back the rest of
[1:01:02] she she may not have ever known that
[1:01:04] that little boy that came to the altar
[1:01:06] that night, Amen, was white booty. that
[1:01:09] led half a million souls to Jesus
[1:01:11] Christ. But I guarantee you one thing,
[1:01:12] she knows it now
[1:01:15] because she's over there. She's over
[1:01:17] there with him. We get to tell the
[1:01:19] story. We get to hear about the story.
[1:01:22] But she
[1:01:23] had a position nobody would want. That's
[1:01:26] why I say don't despise where God's put
[1:01:29] you. Don't despise what God's made you.
[1:01:32] Don't despise the position that God's
[1:01:34] placed you in. Just fulfill that
[1:01:37] position. You cannot fall. God will
[1:01:39] bless you in that position and that
[1:01:42] 500,000 souls or whatever it was.
[1:01:44] Brother Brandon threw a number out
[1:01:46] there. Half a million souls. Who knows
[1:01:49] now that she gets a count of those half
[1:01:52] a million souls because that one boy
[1:01:55] because of something in her heart to do
[1:01:56] for the Lord. Amen. You think about the
[1:02:00] positions that God puts us in. You never
[1:02:02] know what the the weight of eternity
[1:02:05] might unfold in that circumstance or
[1:02:08] that situation or what God told you to
[1:02:10] do or what God led you to do. By most
[1:02:13] standards, especially even in this
[1:02:16] message, by most message standards, if
[1:02:20] you had a revival and only one person
[1:02:23] came to the altar and gave their heart
[1:02:25] to God, you'd consider that a failure. A
[1:02:27] lot of people would are not as
[1:02:29] successful as you thought it should be.
[1:02:32] Amen. But what did that one person
[1:02:35] accomplish? Amen. In the hands of God,
[1:02:39] we would look at and say, "Oh, well,
[1:02:41] what was the point of doing all that?
[1:02:44] Maybe just had one boy come down. He
[1:02:46] probably wasn't even real. He's probably
[1:02:47] faking it. He just got up caught in
[1:02:49] emotion or something." That's the way
[1:02:52] people think. Unfortunately, that's the
[1:02:54] way people talk so many times.
[1:02:57] There could have been a billion people
[1:02:59] came down to that altar and only one
[1:03:03] was Dwight Moody. Only one may have
[1:03:06] actually stayed with Christ. Been that
[1:03:09] person
[1:03:10] doesn't know. But we consider the
[1:03:12] billion coming a great success and the
[1:03:15] one coming a failure. But the one coming
[1:03:18] is what God needed. I remember the time
[1:03:21] I I think it's on tape or uh maybe I
[1:03:23] heard brother Roger tell this testimony
[1:03:25] but Roger Collins but uh brother Random
[1:03:28] had these they of course in his early
[1:03:30] days that he had these managers that set
[1:03:32] up the meetings and they had these great
[1:03:34] meetings they were doing in Chicago and
[1:03:36] had these meetings that they were going
[1:03:38] to have uh several nights in a row of
[1:03:40] meetings and people coming up and
[1:03:42] getting prayed for and and all that's
[1:03:44] going on and and the the lay hands on
[1:03:48] and the praying over people and the
[1:03:50] things that happened in all of his
[1:03:51] meetings.
[1:03:52] But after the third night or something,
[1:03:56] brother ran and went to the manager,
[1:03:57] believe it was the manager. He said,
[1:03:59] "The one person that God sent me here
[1:04:02] for came in last night. We can close it
[1:04:05] down."
[1:04:06] They didn't.
[1:04:08] But that one person, he said, "That one
[1:04:10] person, this was in Chicago, I believe.
[1:04:13] That one person that God sent me here
[1:04:15] for came in.
[1:04:18] So who's to explain that saints? But you
[1:04:21] can explain God. You can't reason God.
[1:04:24] You just have to be able to be in the
[1:04:26] position to let God move you and make
[1:04:28] you and mold you and show you and lead
[1:04:31] you and guide you and put you in that
[1:04:34] position.
[1:04:35] This woman was in that position.
[1:04:39] But something came in her heart to do
[1:04:41] something for God.
[1:04:43] Praise the Lord. And what did God do?
[1:04:46] God blessed it.
[1:04:48] Amen. It was for a purpose. Let me
[1:04:50] finish this. He said that woman had
[1:04:53] something to do. It was for a purpose.
[1:04:56] She was made She was made a wash woman
[1:05:00] for a purpose.
[1:05:03] Praise the Lord. Nobody wants to be the
[1:05:05] watch woman. But oh, if we can just find
[1:05:08] our place, get in our position, fulfill
[1:05:10] the point, the place that God wants us
[1:05:12] to, how he'll bless, how he'll make that
[1:05:18] shine in the house of God. Now, you say,
[1:05:20] "Bless the little old wash woman. Did
[1:05:23] she get a big raise?" No. No. I doubt
[1:05:26] she got any more money.
[1:05:28] But look at the blessing she got. Look
[1:05:31] how God blessed what she did.
[1:05:35] She was made a wash woman for a purpose.
[1:05:38] Praise God. Let us just fulfill that
[1:05:41] purpose, Lord. What is the position that
[1:05:44] you want me in? What you want me to do?
[1:05:47] Amen. We never know. It's in God's
[1:05:51] hands. Brother says, "And don't despise
[1:05:55] where God's got you, but serve your
[1:05:57] purpose."
[1:05:59] Don't despise where God's got you. Serve
[1:06:01] that purpose. Whatever that purpose is.
[1:06:04] may might not be the grandioso things
[1:06:07] that everybody looks to or like I said
[1:06:10] everybody wants all the money. Everybody
[1:06:12] wants to be rich. Everybody wants to be
[1:06:14] the picture. Everybody wants to be that
[1:06:16] position
[1:06:18] but not everybody can.
[1:06:22] Amen. God has a place and every bit of
[1:06:25] it plays its part.
[1:06:28] Amen. You know, I'm gonna say this close
[1:06:32] in just a minute.
[1:06:34] I I played a lot of basketball growing
[1:06:36] up. I was from North Carolina. So, you
[1:06:38] know, in North Carolina when you're
[1:06:40] born, instead of the doctors spanking
[1:06:42] you, they give you a basketball. And if
[1:06:43] you can dribble, you're alive.
[1:06:46] So, I grew up playing a lot of
[1:06:47] basketball. And I know on basketball
[1:06:51] teams
[1:06:54] when they win a championship,
[1:06:57] whether you played one second on the
[1:07:00] floor all season, doesn't matter. If you
[1:07:04] win a championship, you get the same
[1:07:07] ring or the same accolades that the
[1:07:11] leading scorer and all American on the
[1:07:13] team got.
[1:07:15] If you're the last person on the bench,
[1:07:18] you didn't spend one second in one game
[1:07:21] all season, you get the exact same
[1:07:24] reward as the leading scorer, all
[1:07:26] American basketball player. Amen. Same
[1:07:30] reward.
[1:07:32] Praise God.
[1:07:34] You tell me God's a respector of person.
[1:07:37] God is no respector of person. Amen.
[1:07:40] Same reward. Praise the Lord. It may not
[1:07:43] be the best. It may not be the one
[1:07:44] everybody wants. May not be the one out
[1:07:46] front. In fact, a lot of times I wish I
[1:07:48] was the one that was in the back corner,
[1:07:50] but it may not be that one, but serve
[1:07:53] that purpose. And God bless you in that
[1:07:55] purpose. Amen. I'm going to read this
[1:07:57] and I'm going to close. First
[1:07:59] Corinthians, I I'll get back to this
[1:08:02] next week.
[1:08:05] 1 Corinthians uh chapter 7.
[1:08:09] Amen. There's victory.
[1:08:11] There's victory in serving your purpose.
[1:08:13] There's victory in finding your place in
[1:08:16] the body of Christ. And there's victory
[1:08:18] in serving and abiding in that position.
[1:08:21] There's victory. There's freedom in it.
[1:08:24] Amen. There's a liberty in living in the
[1:08:27] position, living in the placement where
[1:08:30] God put you. There's freedom in that.
[1:08:32] Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 7
[1:08:37] verse 20. Let every man abide in the
[1:08:41] same calling wherein he was called.
[1:08:45] Art thou being a servant care not for
[1:08:48] it? But if thou mayest be made free, use
[1:08:52] it rather. Use the position. Amen. That
[1:08:55] place.
[1:08:57] Use it. For he that is called in the
[1:09:00] Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's
[1:09:03] free man. And who doesn't want that?
[1:09:07] Amen. Everybody wants to go to heaven,
[1:09:09] but nobody wants to die.
[1:09:14] Amen. Everybody wants to go to heaven,
[1:09:16] but nobody wants to die. You want to be
[1:09:18] the Lord's free man, then be his
[1:09:20] servant. Be be the position he's put you
[1:09:23] in. Likewise also, he that is called,
[1:09:26] being free, is is Christ's servant. Ye
[1:09:29] are bought with a price, but not ye the
[1:09:31] servants of uh uh be not ye the servants
[1:09:35] of men. Brethren, let every man wherein
[1:09:38] he is called, therein abide with God.
[1:09:43] Abide with God. Abide in that calling.
[1:09:46] Abide in that position. Let God use you
[1:09:50] in that place. Find that place. That's
[1:09:52] the number one thing people have. We
[1:09:54] find that place that we're supposed to
[1:09:56] be in. I trust is most of us mature
[1:09:58] Christians have found that place. But we
[1:10:00] find that place and abide in that place
[1:10:03] and don't despise it. Let God use you in
[1:10:06] it. We don't know or have record that
[1:10:08] this woman did anything before or
[1:10:11] anything after she rented that stable.
[1:10:14] But it doesn't matter. It's that one
[1:10:16] thing that God had her do. Amen. That
[1:10:19] one thing, that one place. And she had
[1:10:21] in her heart to do and she did it. She
[1:10:24] didn't let anything stand in her way.
[1:10:26] She didn't complain about the money as
[1:10:28] as we know of or any of that. She did
[1:10:31] it. And look what God did. And look how
[1:10:34] God blesses us. What is that reward
[1:10:36] going to be on the other side? Amen.
[1:10:39] Praise the Lord. God help us to be able
[1:10:41] to fulfill that position that called us
[1:10:43] to be in. Amen. God will call you to
[1:10:46] that place. Amen. Maybe
[1:10:50] it may take you away from family. It may
[1:10:52] take you away from friends. It may take
[1:10:54] you away from a a group that you may
[1:10:56] have been a part of. Look at Abraham.
[1:10:58] That's what I was going to close. Say,
[1:11:00] look at Abraham. Abraham had to leave
[1:11:03] his home. He had to leave his family.
[1:11:04] Had to leave everything that he knew and
[1:11:06] loved because God told him to follow me.
[1:11:09] Come with me and I will send you to a
[1:11:11] place. Now, what promise did he have
[1:11:13] other than that voice that spoke to him?
[1:11:17] I mean, look at Moses. The same thing
[1:11:19] Moses could have been, you think about
[1:11:21] Moses' position, he could have been the
[1:11:23] most powerful person on the earth, the
[1:11:26] been in the most powerful position. You
[1:11:29] would think naturally if you just think
[1:11:32] humanly that he would have been better
[1:11:34] off to just ascend to the throne of
[1:11:38] Pharaoh which he was in line to do and
[1:11:41] then he could have freed the slaves.
[1:11:43] Then he could have freed the Hebrews. He
[1:11:45] could have let them all go because he is
[1:11:47] Pharaoh.
[1:11:48] His word was law whatever he said and
[1:11:50] then he could have let them go. Amen.
[1:11:53] But then that would have brought glory
[1:11:54] to Moses not glory to God.
[1:11:59] So instead of being in line to be the
[1:12:02] next pharaoh, he became a mudber and
[1:12:04] went down into the dirt and the mud and
[1:12:06] trumped just like his just like his
[1:12:09] family did, just like his inheritance
[1:12:12] did. His posterity, his or not posterity
[1:12:15] at the time, but his family that he was
[1:12:17] with, all of the Hebrews are all down.
[1:12:19] He became one of them. Cursed, run out
[1:12:22] of town. God sent him back. He had to
[1:12:25] leave everything and everybody.
[1:12:28] Brother Brandham had to.
[1:12:30] So God may have you to put you in that
[1:12:32] position. God,
[1:12:35] it's all nice and comfortable when you
[1:12:36] just sitting there and ease and all, but
[1:12:38] God may send you someplace that you
[1:12:41] weren't expecting.
[1:12:43] He may separate you from family. He may
[1:12:45] separate you from friends. And it may
[1:12:48] not be and it may not be that th that
[1:12:50] those family members or those friends
[1:12:52] were a bad influence. I'm not saying
[1:12:54] that, right? God's just got something
[1:12:57] else for you to do. God's got some other
[1:13:00] place to send you. God's got something
[1:13:02] else he wants you to accomplish and do
[1:13:03] for him. Can we do it? Amen. Praise the
[1:13:08] Lord. Whatever it is, let's stand to our
[1:13:09] feet if we could. I'm going to close it.
[1:13:16] Whatever that place is, whatever that
[1:13:17] position, whatever that leading is,
[1:13:20] whatever
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:23] We do that because it's his leading in
[1:13:25] our lives to do it. We want to be
[1:13:27] Christians. We want to be Christians.
[1:13:30] Amen. We believe we're Christians. We
[1:13:32] believe we're born again. We believe
[1:13:34] we're greater than than our a part of
[1:13:37] something that's greater than ourselves.
[1:13:40] Amen. And we follow that place and we
[1:13:42] follow that leading. We follow that that
[1:13:44] God leads us to and shows us and blesses
[1:13:47] us in. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:13:50] Let's sing this. before we go today.
[1:13:54] Amen. This song,
[1:13:56] it's in the book. We'll have it on the
[1:13:58] screen here.
[1:14:01] See if you got a book at home or
[1:14:02] something you want to look. It's 2 in
[1:14:04] the book. Amen.
[1:14:09] I have on the screen. Victory in Jesus.
[1:14:12] Praise the Lord. Let's sing it.
[1:14:15] I heard an old
[1:14:18] story.
[1:14:19] How a savior came from glory. How he
[1:14:24] gave his life on Calvary
[1:14:27] to save a rich like me.
[1:14:31] I heard about his throne of his precious
[1:14:36] blood atoning.
[1:14:40] And I repent in all my sins and want the
[1:14:45] victory.
[1:14:48] Victory
[1:14:50] in Jesus
[1:14:52] my savior
[1:14:54] forever.
[1:14:56] He sought me and he bought me with his
[1:15:01] redeeing blood.
[1:15:04] He loved me. I knew him and all my love
[1:15:10] is to him. He wants me to victory
[1:15:16] beneath the cleansing glass. Now I heard
[1:15:21] about a manion. He is built for me in
[1:15:26] glory.
[1:15:28] And I heard about the streets of gold
[1:15:32] beyond the crystal sea.
[1:15:36] about the angels singing and the old red
[1:15:43] story
[1:15:44] and some sweet day I'll sing out there
[1:15:48] the song of victory.
[1:15:52] Oh victory
[1:15:54] in Jesus my savior forever.
[1:16:00] He saw me and he bought me with his
[1:16:05] redeeming blood.
[1:16:08] He loved me. I knew him and all my love
[1:16:14] is to him. He punched me to victory
[1:16:20] beneath. Let's sing it one more time
[1:16:22] now. Oh, victory
[1:16:26] in Jesus
[1:16:28] my savior
[1:16:30] forever.
[1:16:32] He sought me and he bought me with his
[1:16:37] redeeming love.
[1:16:40] He loved me
[1:16:42] to him and all my love is to him. He
[1:16:48] plunged me to victory
[1:16:51] beneath the cleansing flood.
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:57] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Victory in our
[1:17:00] Lord Jesus. What a greater victory that
[1:17:03] there has never been but in the name of
[1:17:06] Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord. Amen.

[1:17:33] Abide in that purpose. One day soon, I
[1:17:35] believe very soon we're going home to be
[1:17:37] with him. Amen. Praise the Lord. God
