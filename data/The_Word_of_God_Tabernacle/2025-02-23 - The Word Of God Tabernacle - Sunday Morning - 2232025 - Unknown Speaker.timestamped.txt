[51:40] the scripture amen and start the next
[51:43] part of our series here in Matthew
[51:46] Chapter
[51:48] 5 amen Matthew Chapter
[51:52] 5 we'll read just one verse in chapter
[51:56] five
[52:02] amen praise the Lord thankful to be in
[52:04] the house of the Lord today amen thank
[52:06] for the Lord's grace and mercy to us
[52:10] amen praise the Lord Jesus St Matthew
[52:13] Chapter 5 1 verse
[52:17] 48 amen
[52:24] 548 we don't know it very very
[52:27] well been quoting it quite a bit over
[52:29] the past few weeks just figured we would
[52:32] start this part of it with that with
[52:34] actually reading that scripture so but
[52:36] before we do let's just bow our heads
[52:38] for another word of prayer if we
[52:40] could precious Lord Jesus we're so very
[52:43] thankful again of another beautiful day
[52:45] that you give us thank you for a place
[52:47] again Lord I don't ever ever want to
[52:49] take for granted Lord that you blessed
[52:51] us with this place that we can come in
[52:54] from out of the world father and meet
[52:55] with you and for you to speak to us Lord
[52:58] if we worship you and come in from out
[53:00] of the world and have this atmosphere
[53:03] that we feel created around us Lord
[53:05] knowing that your spirit is here today
[53:07] knowing that you promised we're two or
[53:09] three were together in your name you
[53:11] would be in the midst knowing god that
[53:13] we come here Lord with a song on our
[53:15] lips and a praise in our heart for you
[53:18] believing God that you're going to be
[53:19] honored and worship through our praise
[53:22] and through our honor to you God through
[53:24] our worship Lord Jesus Lord knowing that
[53:27] you're here father makes every bit of it
[53:30] oh so worth it God for without you none
[53:33] of it would mean anything but Lord we
[53:36] believe that you're here today God may
[53:38] you just continue to move in this
[53:39] service in a supernatural way God may
[53:42] you continue to bless us and strengthen
[53:44] us and anoint us Lord for the word that
[53:47] is to come now believing Lord that it's
[53:49] going to come from you through our lips
[53:51] Lord and Lord to our ears God anoint our
[53:54] ears anoint the lips speak only what
[53:57] you'd have to be said today shut my lips
[53:59] anything that should not be said God but
[54:02] just believing you in complete total
[54:04] control the Holy Spirit to use us
[54:07] according to your glory and honor
[54:09] accomplish that in this service today
[54:11] Father what would be your perfect will
[54:13] for it Lord Lord you set it aside you
[54:16] predestinated it we're just fulfilling
[54:18] the part Lord that you already
[54:20] manifested for us here and Lord just
[54:22] believing God we're here for that
[54:24] purpose we rebuke every demonic spirit
[54:27] that would try to hurt H or infiltrate
[54:29] this service in any way that you God
[54:32] would get the glory honor and praise for
[54:34] all that is said and done we thank you
[54:36] for it all Lord thank you for those that
[54:38] have come Lord those who may be
[54:39] streaming or those who may even be watch
[54:41] archive God bless them richly as well I
[54:44] pray may your will be done father in all
[54:47] that we do and say we commit it to you
[54:49] now in the precious holy and lovely name
[54:51] of our Lord and savior we pray amen amen
[54:55] amen s
[54:57] Matthew 5 verse
[55:01] 48 Matthew 5:48 simply says be ye
[55:04] therefore perfect even as your father
[55:07] which is in heaven is perfect you can be
[55:10] seated if You'
[55:12] like then how many times of course we've
[55:15] gone over and went through and
[55:17] recognized that that is not a sinless
[55:19] Perfection but it is a Perfection that
[55:22] means of a full age or maturity or a
[55:24] mature Christian amen and I said I read
[55:27] that specifically to start this because
[55:30] of the scriptures that we're going to
[55:31] read Hereafter amen several of them are
[55:34] going to point back and refer to uh the
[55:37] understanding that we have here of what
[55:40] that word perfect means as it is used
[55:43] several times in the New Testament amen
[55:45] we mentioned last week and we will get
[55:47] to again uh there is a different
[55:50] Perfection amen that is
[55:53] a have reached a fullness or a comp
[55:56] completion if you will can't say that we
[55:59] have reached a comp a state of
[56:01] completion but we can say we reach a
[56:04] place of spiritual maturity in the Lord
[56:07] amen but not completion that's where
[56:09] Jesus is that's where uh that word uh
[56:13] that is introduced in the scripture
[56:15] referring to him as being perfect praise
[56:18] the Lord not just mature but uh of
[56:21] completion of perfection of sinless
[56:24] perfection amen but but uh as we go
[56:27] through it we'll see the the the several
[56:29] times that we find this in the scripture
[56:32] here as we read through today so we had
[56:35] uh three parts I believe it was of we're
[56:37] growing in Grace knowledge so we'll
[56:39] start today on uh the thought of
[56:41] maturity so this is adoption part six
[56:44] maturity part one so as we do that let's
[56:47] go over to First Corinthians now uh
[56:49] chapter
[56:52] 2 we'll try to begin to draw our context
[56:56] for these from these next few
[56:59] scriptures beginning with 1 Corinthians
[57:01] chapter 2 verse
[57:04] one Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[57:09] verse one notice as we're going to
[57:12] probably get to uh it was just a thought
[57:14] the lord gave me this morning to maybe a
[57:16] direction to go outside of the notes and
[57:19] things that already had so we'll see how
[57:21] that happens I want you realize or let's
[57:24] notice recognize that there were
[57:26] actually two letters sent to the
[57:29] Corinthian Church amen two so there's
[57:33] purposes to everything so uh I believe
[57:36] there's a purpose to that but in the
[57:38] first letter second chapter first verse
[57:42] and I Brethren when I came unto you came
[57:45] not with Excellency of speech or of
[57:48] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[57:51] of God now why didn't he come to them
[57:53] speaking wisdom amen continue on for I
[57:57] determined not to know anything among
[57:59] you save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[58:03] that is a a wonderful aspiration for any
[58:07] of us to attain to amen and I was with
[58:10] you in weakness and in fear and in much
[58:13] trembling and my speech and my preaching
[58:17] was not with enticing words of man's
[58:19] Wisdom but in the demonstration of the
[58:21] spirit and of power amen that your face
[58:25] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[58:28] but in the power of God which would lead
[58:31] me to believe that Paul is making this a
[58:35] specific example of the Corinthian
[58:38] Church to to to give us a an
[58:42] understanding that the Corinthian Church
[58:45] would have been subject to the the the
[58:49] the man the the wisdom of men amen and
[58:53] and brought and swayed by the wisdom of
[58:57] great words and great orator and great
[59:01] speech that would lead me to believe
[59:03] because he said I didn't come to you
[59:05] this way amen now look I say this for a
[59:09] reason there's a reason that we
[59:11] understand um uh that how we
[59:16] speak now let's go back my speech uh my
[59:19] speech was and my preaching was not with
[59:22] enticing words of man's Wisdom amen why
[59:25] not
[59:28] amen why wasn't it why didn't his speech
[59:30] come to the Corinthian Church with
[59:32] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[59:35] the demonstration of spirit and power
[59:38] because you know Saul is intelligent as
[59:42] this man was learning at the feet of Gia
[59:45] could have absolutely come to them with
[59:49] great words of wisdom he could have done
[59:52] it but he didn't to the Corinthian
[59:54] Church so why did me now again would
[59:57] lead me to believe that they would that
[1:00:00] they would have come subject to that if
[1:00:03] he had come in that way amen but he came
[1:00:06] with a demonstration of spirit and power
[1:00:09] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:00:11] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:00:14] which means that they may have let their
[1:00:18] faith be in a man instead of God yes
[1:00:22] amen so he came to them the way he came
[1:00:25] recognizing
[1:00:26] the need of that
[1:00:28] church God knowing the need of that
[1:00:31] specific Church there's always a reason
[1:00:34] see why God has people in certain places
[1:00:38] there's a reason why God has certain men
[1:00:41] rise up uh to Pastor maybe a large group
[1:00:45] maybe a small group maybe a medium-sized
[1:00:47] group but God puts everybody where he
[1:00:50] wants them if you belong to him now if
[1:00:52] you don't it's just a church of the
[1:00:54] world or a non Goodall Pastor whatever
[1:00:57] it might be then it really doesn't
[1:00:59] matter but in God's economy he puts
[1:01:02] everybody where he wants them to be
[1:01:04] where they should be and because when
[1:01:06] Paul even when Paul now Paul said I I I
[1:01:10] become all things to all men that I
[1:01:12] might that I might win some
[1:01:16] now we're I want to go over in a few
[1:01:18] minutes and look at something because I
[1:01:20] want to finish this reading here and
[1:01:22] recognize the difference in the way Paul
[1:01:26] speaks to different churches right amen
[1:01:29] so there's a reason he said this to tell
[1:01:32] them that to recognize that their faith
[1:01:36] could have been drawn into the wisdom of
[1:01:38] man instead of the power of God right
[1:01:41] amen so now let's continue how be it
[1:01:44] sixth verse how be it we speak with wi
[1:01:48] uh how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:01:52] that are perfect so what's he telling
[1:01:54] them
[1:01:56] you are not a mature church because that
[1:01:59] perfect is the same perfect that we just
[1:02:01] read in Matthew 5:48 it's the same word
[1:02:04] full mature full age mature so he says
[1:02:07] how be that we speak wisdom among them
[1:02:09] that are perfect but he just told them
[1:02:12] that he didn't speak to them in wisdom
[1:02:14] so what's he telling them he's telling
[1:02:17] them they're not a mature church right
[1:02:20] because he said I would have come in in
[1:02:22] in in speaking with wisdom but I wanted
[1:02:26] your faith to lie in the power of God
[1:02:29] but or how be it we do speak wisdom
[1:02:32] among them that are mature those that
[1:02:35] are perfect so uh he's really literally
[1:02:40] letting them know uh I'm I'm bringing it
[1:02:43] to you this way because you are not a
[1:02:45] mature church and you can't receive it
[1:02:49] you don't give a little baby a T-bone
[1:02:52] steak you give a little baby a milk
[1:02:54] bottle because because that's all they
[1:02:56] can stomach right if they're young
[1:02:58] enough that's all they can even chew
[1:03:01] because they're not ready for meat their
[1:03:03] body's not ready for it their systems
[1:03:05] not ready for it they can't they can't
[1:03:08] digest it they can't absorb it well
[1:03:11] Paul's telling them the same thing here
[1:03:13] I did this because you're not ready for
[1:03:16] it I do speak in wisdom to those that
[1:03:19] are mature to those that are perfect but
[1:03:22] you're not a perfect or mature church
[1:03:25] right amen that's right we speak wisdom
[1:03:28] among them that are perfect yet not the
[1:03:30] wisdom of this world not the wisdom of
[1:03:32] the world now the wisdom of God you go
[1:03:35] and look it up it just means those
[1:03:37] things that God brings
[1:03:39] to in harder to understand or harder to
[1:03:43] know spiritual truths is what the wisdom
[1:03:47] is those things that are maybe harder to
[1:03:50] understand harder to uh to uh believe
[1:03:54] those things he does Paul said we speak
[1:03:58] these things to those that are perfect
[1:04:00] because they can receive it but those
[1:04:01] that are not cannot receive
[1:04:04] it not the wisdom of the world though
[1:04:07] the wisdom of God nor of the princes of
[1:04:10] this world that come to not but we speak
[1:04:13] the wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[1:04:16] hidden Mystery which God ordained before
[1:04:18] the world unto our Glory which none of
[1:04:21] the princes of this world knew for had
[1:04:24] they known it they would not I have
[1:04:26] crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is
[1:04:28] written I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[1:04:30] neither had entered into the heart of
[1:04:32] man the things that uh which God had
[1:04:35] prepared for them that love him praise
[1:04:37] God amen
[1:04:40] amen but God hath received them unto us
[1:04:44] by his spirit for the spirit searcheth
[1:04:47] all things yeay the Deep things of God
[1:04:51] or the meaty things the more wisdom
[1:04:54] things the things that are are hidden to
[1:04:56] the wise and prudent the things that are
[1:04:59] revealed to babes the things that are
[1:05:00] revealed to those that are of perfect
[1:05:04] mature full age maturity God has
[1:05:07] revealed to us by his Spirit those
[1:05:10] things the spirit searches those things
[1:05:14] amen the things of God the Deep things
[1:05:16] of God the things that are hard to
[1:05:19] understand the things like John 6 when
[1:05:22] Jesus come to them and he spoke to them
[1:05:24] he went on about
[1:05:26] and they and basically he talked about
[1:05:29] uh uh being born again he talked about
[1:05:32] uh the way they were to live and all and
[1:05:34] they come up and basically said unless
[1:05:36] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:05:38] have no part of me and they said this is
[1:05:40] a hard say who can hear
[1:05:42] this well those that are
[1:05:44] mature those that are perfect those that
[1:05:47] are grown in the word of God Amen in the
[1:05:50] wisdom of God in the truth of God in the
[1:05:53] in the knowledge of God those who God
[1:05:56] has revealed to them those that God has
[1:05:59] spoken to them those that God has
[1:06:01] uncovered that mystery manifested it to
[1:06:05] them they can understand amen amen now
[1:06:08] notice the 12 disciples weren't even to
[1:06:11] that place yet
[1:06:13] right amen but Peter had enough sense to
[1:06:18] the rest of them to stand and
[1:06:20] say you have the words of eternal life
[1:06:23] where are we going to go we know that
[1:06:25] you have the words of eternal life don't
[1:06:28] understand it amen it may be on the
[1:06:30] Shelf over here may I may not quite
[1:06:33] gotten the Revelation that yet amen may
[1:06:35] not quite understand it but you had the
[1:06:38] words of eternal life and that's good
[1:06:40] enough for us amen whatever you say we
[1:06:43] believe not understand maybe but we
[1:06:46] believe amen we believe it praise the
[1:06:49] Lord now from there again like we said
[1:06:51] before you they grew they grew in the
[1:06:54] grace and knowledge and as continued to
[1:06:56] grow in the grace and knowledge they got
[1:06:58] uh closer to the Lord and those things
[1:07:00] God began to unveil unveil to them and
[1:07:03] revealed to them and when they got it
[1:07:05] and it it came and you can stick that
[1:07:07] puzzle piece right where it belongs and
[1:07:09] it becomes a beautiful picture amen they
[1:07:12] got to that point those disciples came
[1:07:14] to that point amen not all 12 of them
[1:07:17] but U because one of them sold the Lord
[1:07:21] and for 30 pieces of silver so yeah he
[1:07:24] didn't but the others they came to that
[1:07:26] point Peter himself when he said those
[1:07:30] you had the words of eternal life you
[1:07:31] might understand but when it came as he
[1:07:34] came along he came to the point that
[1:07:36] yeah he it became revealed to him he
[1:07:39] began to see it he began to talk about
[1:07:42] it and write about it and it's in the
[1:07:43] scripture we can read about it now
[1:07:46] because he finally came to that place
[1:07:49] where they understood now first uh First
[1:07:52] Corinthians uh the same First
[1:07:53] Corinthians the third chapter
[1:07:59] he continues on the letter but I want to
[1:08:01] skip that last those last few verses and
[1:08:03] just go to uh the third chapter first
[1:08:08] verse third chapter first verse and I be
[1:08:11] and I Brethren could not speak unto you
[1:08:15] as unto spiritual now he's telling them
[1:08:17] as he already told them right uh I speak
[1:08:19] wisdom to those that are mature you're
[1:08:21] not
[1:08:22] mature I could not speak unto you
[1:08:26] as unto spiritual but as unto carnal
[1:08:29] even as babes in
[1:08:31] Christ I have fed you with milk and not
[1:08:34] with me for hither to ye were not able
[1:08:37] to Bear whether yet now or are ye able
[1:08:40] for ye are not for for ye are yet carnal
[1:08:45] whereas there is among you envs and
[1:08:47] stripes and divisions are ye not carnal
[1:08:50] and walk as men for while one saith I'm
[1:08:53] of Paul another I'm of apoll are you not
[1:08:56] carnal of course they haven't grown up
[1:08:58] enough to realize that they said well
[1:09:02] this one said this and this one and
[1:09:04] these were baptized by this and this and
[1:09:06] baptized by that one and this one I
[1:09:09] belong to him so you're not a Christian
[1:09:11] because you don't belong to this church
[1:09:13] well you're not in the message because
[1:09:14] you don't go where I go and and all this
[1:09:17] that's just pettiness amen pettiness
[1:09:19] carnality pettiness stuff that doesn't
[1:09:22] mean anything in the economy of God if
[1:09:24] any of has to be done or said let God do
[1:09:27] it not me it's not your position to tell
[1:09:29] a brother that he's out of the will of
[1:09:31] God because he's not going to your
[1:09:33] church or not doing what you think he
[1:09:35] should you let him alone and let God
[1:09:37] take care of it God will handle him in
[1:09:39] the way he's supposed to be handled
[1:09:41] that's just childish they can't grow
[1:09:44] because they can't understand and that's
[1:09:45] why Paul said them I only fed you with
[1:09:47] milk because you you're not mature
[1:09:50] enough to handle the meat of the word if
[1:09:52] I gave you the meat of the word it would
[1:09:54] choke you to death
[1:09:55] right you couldn't stand it amen so what
[1:09:58] he had to do he had to handle them with
[1:10:01] with kid gloves right amen now I want
[1:10:04] you to notice a stark difference here
[1:10:07] let's go over to Ephesians chapter 1 and
[1:10:10] notice a very Stark
[1:10:13] difference we read a lot of the first
[1:10:15] chapter of Ephesians now Corinthians had
[1:10:18] to have two letters written to
[1:10:21] them they did eventually begin to get uh
[1:10:25] to gain a little maturity towards the
[1:10:27] end but look I want you to see how how
[1:10:31] he spoke to them and how he speaks to
[1:10:35] the Ephesian church amen two different
[1:10:39] things really amen it's he he goes to
[1:10:43] One
[1:10:43] Church it reminds me sometimes of of
[1:10:47] things you listen to when you listen to
[1:10:49] brother brandham and he might have a
[1:10:52] three or
[1:10:53] four uh uh sermons three or four uh
[1:10:58] meetings with the same
[1:11:00] sermon the same
[1:11:02] title but if you listen to them you can
[1:11:06] catch some notes that are the same but
[1:11:09] really in a lot of times when they're in
[1:11:11] different churches and different venues
[1:11:13] with different people you listen to them
[1:11:15] and and sometimes you don't even think
[1:11:17] it's the same it's the same topic he's
[1:11:20] talking about it the same he might read
[1:11:22] the same scripture or give a same note
[1:11:24] or something here or there but the
[1:11:26] message goes a total different
[1:11:29] direction because he's speaking to a
[1:11:31] whole different group of people right
[1:11:33] he's speaking to a people that may have
[1:11:35] not been mature and this group is mature
[1:11:38] this group needed this or this group
[1:11:40] needed that and they all were in
[1:11:42] different places and they all had
[1:11:44] different things and and it was
[1:11:46] different things going in all of these
[1:11:47] churches in all of their lives and God
[1:11:49] knows that and if a man is controlled by
[1:11:52] God and God's the one Speaking then you
[1:11:55] know God is the one in control amen
[1:11:58] that's right then God then God speaks to
[1:12:01] each individual each Church the way they
[1:12:04] need to be spoke to amen look at this in
[1:12:08] in
[1:12:10] Ephesians brother uh uh Paul starts
[1:12:13] talking about right off the bat the will
[1:12:17] of God in the first CH in the first
[1:12:20] verse of the first chapter he talks
[1:12:24] about the will of God
[1:12:25] God and then before we even get out of
[1:12:28] the fourth verse he's talking about
[1:12:30] being chosen from the foundation of the
[1:12:33] world do you hear anything preached like
[1:12:35] that to the Corinthian Church no in the
[1:12:38] first four verses he's talking about the
[1:12:42] will of God
[1:12:44] predestination and being chosen from the
[1:12:46] foundation of the world things that he
[1:12:49] never even taught to the Corinthian
[1:12:52] Church why because they could would
[1:12:55] accept it right they could not receive
[1:12:57] it they were not a mature enough group
[1:13:00] of people to receive those
[1:13:02] truths amen you know there's a lot of
[1:13:05] things that we talk about as Believers
[1:13:08] there's a lot of Christians Believers
[1:13:10] there's a lot of things that we preach
[1:13:12] there's a lot of things that we hear and
[1:13:14] it becomes maybe unfortunately maybe
[1:13:18] sometimes a little common to us about
[1:13:20] the things that we know in this message
[1:13:23] you go and talk about you go go find a a
[1:13:26] a friend on the street or something even
[1:13:28] another Christian I challenge you go
[1:13:30] down to Calvary or go down to this
[1:13:32] Baptist Church down the street and ask
[1:13:34] them do you know what the Seven Seals
[1:13:36] are they would look at you like a mule
[1:13:38] looking at a new gate they have no idea
[1:13:40] what you're talking about right they
[1:13:42] look like they look like you as cross-
[1:13:44] sided as a man that got kicked in the
[1:13:46] back of the head with by a horse
[1:13:49] right what is Seal what are you talking
[1:13:52] about they have no idea we think that's
[1:13:55] common to
[1:13:56] us amen so understand God allows you to
[1:14:02] receive something that a lot of the
[1:14:04] world C could not
[1:14:06] receive they could not only see it they
[1:14:09] can't or not only receive it they could
[1:14:11] even see it amen so you realize that God
[1:14:16] does things for us and you think oh my
[1:14:19] what are the Deep things of God we know
[1:14:22] what they are yes praise the Lord
[1:14:26] we know what God has spoke to us we know
[1:14:28] what God feeds us you see the difference
[1:14:31] now in in the fifth ver from the 5th to
[1:14:34] the 14th
[1:14:36] verse Paul talks to him about
[1:14:39] predestination he talks to him about
[1:14:41] Redemption he talks about the mysteries
[1:14:44] of God he talks about the coming of the
[1:14:47] fullness of times and inheritance he
[1:14:49] talks about being born again he talks
[1:14:52] about how receiving the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:54] the earnest in the down payment just in
[1:14:57] before half of the first
[1:15:01] chapter things that he never would have
[1:15:03] spoke to the Corinthian Church about
[1:15:05] right why they could not receive it they
[1:15:09] weren't mature to receive it amen that's
[1:15:13] why that's why I Think Jesus prayed
[1:15:15] father I thank you that you hid those
[1:15:18] things from the wise and prudent but
[1:15:20] revealed them to babes such as would
[1:15:23] learn most if not all of the message
[1:15:28] that we talk about and that we preach
[1:15:30] and that we listen to you go to to the
[1:15:33] local Methodist Church down the street
[1:15:36] and they would throw you out on your ear
[1:15:38] amen they would think that you're
[1:15:40] complete lunit toe you've lost your mind
[1:15:44] amen you have no idea what you're
[1:15:46] talking about why because they can't
[1:15:49] receive it right they're just happy to
[1:15:51] hear that this BL that the sky blue and
[1:15:54] the grass is green amen that's why
[1:15:58] excuse me I I hate to call his name but
[1:16:00] I'm going to do it anyway that's why
[1:16:02] Joel o is so popular and people like him
[1:16:06] oh it's just everything is sweet and
[1:16:07] lovely everything is great and beautiful
[1:16:10] everything is blue skies and green grass
[1:16:13] everything is lovely and you know you're
[1:16:15] just great and you just just be a good
[1:16:18] person and you know everything's going
[1:16:19] to be all right you know and oh hogwash
[1:16:24] that's right
[1:16:25] amen that that that's just that ain't
[1:16:28] even milk that that's
[1:16:32] 1% I don't even drink 1% I had one time
[1:16:37] usually I I'll tell you we we go the
[1:16:39] hotels we go to a lot of times they
[1:16:41] don't have milk they have little cartons
[1:16:43] and I go and have a bowl of cereal
[1:16:44] almost every morning so I grab I grab a
[1:16:46] carton and I get my cereal one morning I
[1:16:48] pour it out didn't even realize cuz
[1:16:50] every other place has at least 2% I
[1:16:53] poured it out in the bowl and I started
[1:16:54] I said what is this nasty stuff I looked
[1:16:57] on the cart and it's 1% I threw it in
[1:16:59] garbage I can't stomach that stuff it's
[1:17:02] nasty I'm sorry if you like 1% you have
[1:17:05] to drink 1% that's okay maybe some of us
[1:17:08] should drink 1% but I can't stomach I
[1:17:11] can't stand it it's just horrible to me
[1:17:14] that's just that's that's barely this
[1:17:16] side of water and I mean it just might
[1:17:19] as well put water tap water in your
[1:17:21] cereal and just eat it it's just
[1:17:23] horrible to me but that's these people
[1:17:26] they is spiritually speaking probably
[1:17:28] couldn't even take
[1:17:30] 1% I
[1:17:32] mean just the equl of milk in their
[1:17:36] beverage would probably send them
[1:17:38] flying I I feel sorry for any pastor of
[1:17:41] any kind of church like that got a
[1:17:43] little Revelation from God and tried to
[1:17:44] bring it their congregation keep him out
[1:17:47] faster than he could go they wouldn't
[1:17:49] have any they wouldn't stand for that
[1:17:51] you can't smoke your cigarettes oh my
[1:17:54] goodness you can't go drink your your
[1:17:56] liquor oh yeah I mean you're You're gone
[1:18:00] you can't go party you can't
[1:18:02] do oh my you start calling out about Sin
[1:18:07] yeah and we're not even talking about
[1:18:09] things like sisters dress and hair and
[1:18:11] men being gentlemen and and living Godly
[1:18:14] lives I mean forget about that you
[1:18:18] understand but see there Paul Paul
[1:18:21] understood when and and I said
[1:18:25] understood to the point that God
[1:18:26] revealed it to him because why did we
[1:18:28] read what did we talk about the last
[1:18:31] twoes amen a a a vessel that is Anointed
[1:18:35] of God that is sent by God is going to
[1:18:38] stay on the word of God Amen if you got
[1:18:41] somebody like that that stays on the
[1:18:43] word of God you come to a place and you
[1:18:46] realize these people can't take
[1:18:49] it so he gives them milk but what does
[1:18:52] he do to the Ephesian Church in the
[1:18:54] first 14 verses he goes into more word
[1:18:59] and more depth of the word than he did
[1:19:02] in two letters to the entire Corinthian
[1:19:04] Church and both letters in the first 14
[1:19:08] verses to the Ephesians so you see the
[1:19:12] difference in between a mature church
[1:19:14] and a non-mature church right that's why
[1:19:17] he told him I could not come to you with
[1:19:20] meat I could not come to you with
[1:19:23] revealed truths of the deepness of the
[1:19:25] word I could not come to you with with
[1:19:27] things that it would choke you to death
[1:19:30] right I could not come to you that way
[1:19:32] so I had to come to you with meat milk
[1:19:34] why did I have to do that because you're
[1:19:36] just carnal you are still fussing over
[1:19:39] who belongs to who and who baptized who
[1:19:42] and who their favorite preacher is and
[1:19:44] who their favorite convention preacher
[1:19:46] is and who their favorite oh my yeah I I
[1:19:50] just I I just don't like that stuff I'm
[1:19:53] sorry I got friends I know it's around
[1:19:56] the message and stuff and um I'm just
[1:19:59] I'm just not a fan of that I'm just
[1:20:02] not there's certain meetings that go on
[1:20:05] around the country every day different
[1:20:06] churches different places and I can
[1:20:08] guarantee you within certain within a
[1:20:11] certain aspect of eror they're the six
[1:20:13] same ministers are going to preach in
[1:20:14] every one of those
[1:20:16] meetings right
[1:20:18] why I'm sorry I I'm not popular because
[1:20:22] of it but I think that's just that's
[1:20:25] wrong I I I just I just don't like that
[1:20:28] don't agree with that I understand maybe
[1:20:30] their reasoning amen cuz they get more
[1:20:33] people because a certain person is uh uh
[1:20:36] their favorite preacher or something if
[1:20:38] a man is preaching the word of God it
[1:20:40] doesn't matter if it's coming from God
[1:20:42] it doesn't matter he's a great oror if
[1:20:45] he's beautiful handsome looking man or
[1:20:47] has a great big church or of great
[1:20:49] following or something if God speaking
[1:20:51] then he is going to speak to your heart
[1:20:53] yeah if you're willing to receive it if
[1:20:56] you don't want to receive it that's up
[1:20:57] to you and some people won't receive
[1:20:59] anything that's spoken by another
[1:21:00] minister right don't care how true it is
[1:21:03] no matter how right it is makes me
[1:21:05] wonder who really is bride and who
[1:21:07] really isn't amen who is really born
[1:21:10] again and who really isn't yes if you're
[1:21:12] born again that word's going to feed you
[1:21:15] amen even if it is milk a milk that we
[1:21:18] consider milk of the message it's still
[1:21:20] going to feed you right cuz you know
[1:21:22] when I eat a good steak I still wash it
[1:21:24] down yes I I don't just eat steak I do
[1:21:28] wash it down whether it's water or milk
[1:21:30] or Coke or tea or something I still wash
[1:21:33] it down amen but some people you I well
[1:21:38] anyway it's just this it's it's just
[1:21:40] that spirit I don't I don't like that
[1:21:42] spirit amen if you go around you see
[1:21:45] there probably the it's like the sex the
[1:21:48] same sick people pretty much in most
[1:21:50] meetings speaking all the time starting
[1:21:52] to evolve and change a little bit but
[1:21:54] then is changing over to another
[1:21:56] different six group group of six people
[1:21:59] and I I just anyway that's something I
[1:22:02] just don't understand but you see the
[1:22:04] difference in the maturity levels amen
[1:22:08] now notice and God will only entrust
[1:22:12] look God will only entrust with
[1:22:15] you the Authority or power that matches
[1:22:18] your maturity level notice God will not
[1:22:22] entrust power without character is
[1:22:25] satanic God's not going to give you a
[1:22:28] full power control of that Spirit people
[1:22:30] say I can speak the word and they're and
[1:22:33] they're little babes in the word they're
[1:22:36] still
[1:22:37] immature that I'm sorry that's not God's
[1:22:39] not going to trust you with something
[1:22:42] that you're not able to handle right
[1:22:44] amen he entrusts us with things that
[1:22:47] match our maturity level and we get to
[1:22:50] that place let me just give you an
[1:22:52] example real quick when I first started
[1:22:54] the job that I'm working now I would go
[1:22:58] and one of the first things that was
[1:22:59] spoke to me outside of hey how you doing
[1:23:01] welcome to team blah blah blah was go
[1:23:03] get me a dead
[1:23:05] blow you know what I did I went to the
[1:23:08] trailer having absolutely no clue what I
[1:23:11] was
[1:23:12] doing I didn't know what a dead blow was
[1:23:15] from anything never heard it spok in my
[1:23:18] life all it is is a mallet it's just a
[1:23:21] like a plastic real hard plastic Mallet
[1:23:24] in instead of a instead of a hammer so
[1:23:26] when you hit on something it doesn't
[1:23:28] damage it uh if you if you have to knock
[1:23:31] a the our stainless still arches over
[1:23:34] use a dead blow because if you use a
[1:23:35] hammer it marks up the it marks up the
[1:23:38] arch dead go go get me dead blow I had
[1:23:40] no idea I went I went to the trailer
[1:23:44] looking for a dead blow now he's he's
[1:23:47] speaking gibberish to me something as
[1:23:50] simple as a a wood a a a a plastic
[1:23:54] hammer
[1:23:55] is that simple but I still had no idea
[1:23:57] what he's talking about cuz I hadn't
[1:23:59] learned what that was I just started I'd
[1:24:02] never had any kind
[1:24:04] of experience with that before but I
[1:24:06] went to the trailer anyway and I first
[1:24:09] time I've ever been in the trailer there
[1:24:11] just stuff all over the place I'm like
[1:24:13] what am I even looking for I have no
[1:24:16] idea I was hoping to see a sign or a
[1:24:18] sticker or something that said what he
[1:24:21] said I finally somebody came out there
[1:24:24] and said what you looking for and so I
[1:24:26] told him he said oh it's down here so I
[1:24:27] grabbed it and you know from that day on
[1:24:29] I know exactly what a deblo is I know
[1:24:31] where it is I know what it is I know
[1:24:34] where it goes in every trailer I know
[1:24:36] exactly see now because I've learned
[1:24:38] that right amen and once you learn that
[1:24:41] then it's no longer a secret to amen
[1:24:44] amen you know what it is so it's nothing
[1:24:46] and I and and through the couple even a
[1:24:49] couple years even once in a while
[1:24:52] now couple of the people that's been
[1:24:54] there a while so they'll start talking
[1:24:55] about things and I'm
[1:24:57] just yeah
[1:25:01] yeah I have no idea what they're talking
[1:25:04] about what is this gadget what is it you
[1:25:07] called this I may know what it is but I
[1:25:09] don't know what the technical term is
[1:25:10] and know this what what is he talking I
[1:25:12] have no idea but you know I'm good at
[1:25:14] faking it I am I I admit it I'm good at
[1:25:17] faking it and then after a little while
[1:25:20] another situation arises and something
[1:25:22] comes up and something have oh okay
[1:25:24] that's what they were talking about and
[1:25:26] then I got it and I know what they're
[1:25:28] talking about I know what it's called I
[1:25:29] know where it goes I know how to off and
[1:25:31] I got it and after that I've learned I
[1:25:34] don't have to learn again amen I don't
[1:25:37] have to learn again I went from the milk
[1:25:39] of a dead blow to the to the meat of a a
[1:25:43] a a a switch or something uh whatever it
[1:25:48] is something that's a lot more important
[1:25:51] something that's a lot more meaningful
[1:25:53] but once you learn it you learned it
[1:25:54] you've got it it's there praise the Lord
[1:25:57] I know what it is now now I can go tell
[1:25:59] somebody else now I can go teach
[1:26:02] somebody else you know what I do though
[1:26:04] I don't assume the first person on the
[1:26:06] job for the first week to know what a
[1:26:08] deadblow is I tell them because it
[1:26:12] wasn't told to me but I know now that if
[1:26:15] I want to get a deadblow and I want this
[1:26:17] person to help me get it while I'm doing
[1:26:18] this I tell them what it is and where it
[1:26:20] is and how to get it right so there's no
[1:26:23] ambiguity
[1:26:26] just a different way of teaching but
[1:26:28] it's a different way that people learn
[1:26:30] but I tell them now see but it's it's
[1:26:32] the it's the different levels that you
[1:26:35] come to amen you can entrust me with
[1:26:38] this dead blow on my first day but don't
[1:26:41] you dare trust me with this bulkhead on
[1:26:43] the first day because I might ruin the
[1:26:45] whole the I might ruin the whole place
[1:26:49] right you might can entrust me with a
[1:26:51] drill here to put a hole in the piece of
[1:26:53] concrete don't you dare try to have me
[1:26:55] wire up this uh Master Control Center
[1:26:58] cuz I'll blow up the whole
[1:27:02] place because I don't know I haven't
[1:27:05] reached that place amen but once
[1:27:09] somebody's been with you remember our
[1:27:11] tutor and said and taught you and that
[1:27:14] you learn and that you listen that you
[1:27:17] that that God reveals it and you accept
[1:27:20] it and and it it becomes a part of you
[1:27:23] then you can do it
[1:27:24] amen now somebody tells me dead blood
[1:27:27] know where it is somebody this valve I
[1:27:29] know what it is tell me this the master
[1:27:31] control center I know where this wire
[1:27:33] goes and how this does this and I know
[1:27:35] all that about it now amen I might even
[1:27:38] can teach somebody else how to do it now
[1:27:40] amen because I know but I wasn't trusted
[1:27:44] it's
[1:27:46] like I'm sure Zach tapa don't give Ruth
[1:27:49] their car keys and tell them to pull the
[1:27:52] car around for us it's time to go
[1:27:55] they don't do that they don't even do
[1:27:57] that for Joel and he's about to turn 11
[1:27:59] but he's not old enough yet but when he
[1:28:01] gets old enough he's going to be
[1:28:03] grabbing the car keys to go go take and
[1:28:06] do drive somewhere with it amen at least
[1:28:08] that's the way I was amen because he's
[1:28:12] just too young God will not entrust he
[1:28:15] only will entrust with us that that
[1:28:17] matches our maturity level amen that
[1:28:20] because the last thing we want to do is
[1:28:22] to be choked out
[1:28:24] a lot of people just get choked out you
[1:28:27] can't get choked out I remember uh uh uh
[1:28:32] a brother I think it was brother Wilson
[1:28:34] maybe told me one time I can't remember
[1:28:35] I shouldn't called his name it might not
[1:28:36] have been him but somebody told me one
[1:28:38] time that uh uh they went to a church
[1:28:42] there was a guest speaker and a new
[1:28:46] person just come now I don't remember if
[1:28:49] it was a new convert if it was her first
[1:28:51] service somebody invited her I'm not
[1:28:53] sure but she came in she had really
[1:28:55] short hair her hair was all cut off and
[1:28:58] the preacher got up there and just for
[1:29:00] 30 40 minutes blasted women in short
[1:29:03] hair I don't know I don't remember the
[1:29:05] story if that woman ever came back but
[1:29:08] why why you choke that woman to death
[1:29:12] amen you you choke her out on the very
[1:29:14] first 30 minutes of preaching to her
[1:29:17] yeah don't do thaten you could have
[1:29:20] killed her right there you could have
[1:29:21] lost every opportunity to help that lady
[1:29:24] come to Christ amen just get her to
[1:29:28] Christ God will show her about her hair
[1:29:31] just get her to Christ amen but I may
[1:29:34] have been Wilson I can't remember he
[1:29:36] spent not now Wilson didn't do it he
[1:29:38] told
[1:29:39] me a a minister I don't even I don't
[1:29:42] even think the name was spoken of who
[1:29:44] the minister was but you understand she
[1:29:47] wasn't at the maturity level to receive
[1:29:49] that at least especially not in that
[1:29:51] context not in that way amen so you
[1:29:55] choke a person out then what if you have
[1:29:58] praise the Lord see the god the gifts
[1:30:00] and callings of the gifts and callings
[1:30:02] of God are without repentance or it says
[1:30:05] actually I think the scripture actually
[1:30:07] says the gifts and calling gifts plural
[1:30:10] calling singular amen we had there's
[1:30:14] many gifts but there's one calling amen
[1:30:16] that we have in our
[1:30:18] lives now let's go over to Peter first
[1:30:20] Peter
[1:30:25] of course Satan can impersonate any kind
[1:30:28] of a gift
[1:30:29] so uh gifts and callings without
[1:30:32] repentance brother B says Christ
[1:30:34] revealed in his own word people so
[1:30:37] confused today about the evidence of the
[1:30:39] Holy Ghost why aren people confused
[1:30:42] about the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:44] whether then or now and I would say they
[1:30:46] still are there's a lot of people that
[1:30:49] are so confused about the evidence of
[1:30:51] the Holy Ghost why would they be so
[1:30:52] confused
[1:30:54] probably by listening to
[1:30:56] non-call Holy Ghost filled men preaching
[1:31:00] right is probably the biggest reason
[1:31:02] amen Satan can impersonate any kind of a
[1:31:05] gift that God has got but he cannot
[1:31:08] bring that word word by word right
[1:31:13] that's maturity that's where he failed
[1:31:16] in the Garden of Eden and that's where
[1:31:18] he will always fail and there I say
[1:31:21] bring it down that's that's where people
[1:31:24] fell today amen they can speak in
[1:31:27] tongues or prophesy or have some kind of
[1:31:29] a gift but where where the rubber meets
[1:31:32] the road is where the word comes amen
[1:31:36] where the word meets the word it's got
[1:31:37] to be word upon word line upon line
[1:31:39] precept on precept here the L A little
[1:31:43] amen that's why brother B's talking
[1:31:46] about the the tapy priests on anointed
[1:31:48] ones at the end time they're Anointed
[1:31:51] with the spirit speak in tongues dance
[1:31:53] shout pre preach the gospel and still be
[1:31:55] a devil amen preach the gospel and still
[1:31:58] be a
[1:32:01] devil it's the inside now remember Jesus
[1:32:04] said all the fathers give me will come
[1:32:06] to be no one can come except the father
[1:32:09] call him draw him first amen praise the
[1:32:14] Lord that's why he entrusts us with
[1:32:16] those with with the things that he
[1:32:19] entrusts us on our maturity level amen
[1:32:24] praise the Lord first Peter now I had
[1:32:25] you go to First Peter correct chapter
[1:32:29] 2 verse one First Peter chapter 2 verse1
[1:32:33] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:32:36] all G and hypocrisies and envies and all
[1:32:39] evil speaking that's a great lesson for
[1:32:41] milk so it's a nice milky lesson yes you
[1:32:45] know get outside and forget about your
[1:32:48] carnality your Humanity you know we
[1:32:51] talked about it being sticky sure it is
[1:32:53] but when it ever become okay to have a
[1:32:56] grudge against somebody yeah or uh Envy
[1:33:00] or hypocrisies lay all that stuff aside
[1:33:05] Peter saying remember Peter grew too
[1:33:07] from the time where he said you have the
[1:33:10] words of eternal life see Peter grew too
[1:33:13] wherefore laying aside now all malice
[1:33:15] all Gile hypocrisies envies all evil
[1:33:18] speaking as newborn babies desire the
[1:33:22] sincere sincere mil of the word that ye
[1:33:24] may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted
[1:33:29] that the Lord is gracious to whom
[1:33:31] calling as living unto a uh as unto a
[1:33:35] living Stone disallowed indeed of men
[1:33:37] but chosen of God and precious amen of
[1:33:41] the word of God praise the lord it's a
[1:33:45] place that God's trying to get us all to
[1:33:47] newborn babies desire the sincere milk
[1:33:52] amen sincere milk so it helps us to
[1:33:55] understand there is that that is of
[1:33:58] sincerity right praise the Lord now I
[1:34:00] know brother B said we could be
[1:34:01] sincerely wrong but this is not what
[1:34:04] Peter's talking about he's talking about
[1:34:05] actually being sincere wanting to grow
[1:34:10] wanting to receive what you can receive
[1:34:12] and get all that you can get and
[1:34:14] continue to grow I remember when I first
[1:34:17] came in the message sort of like U like
[1:34:19] I was talking about with the work
[1:34:21] situation that I have was in um
[1:34:25] I remember when I first started coming
[1:34:26] to message there were things that was
[1:34:28] said I didn't understand and I and I
[1:34:31] basically grew up in the message I I
[1:34:34] used to my mom and dad went to work I'd
[1:34:36] go lie in their bed and turn on their
[1:34:37] tape recorder and just lay in their bed
[1:34:39] and listen to it as a kid like Joel's
[1:34:42] age 10 11 12 years old I just sat there
[1:34:45] and listened to it I learned uh not to
[1:34:49] kiss a girl before we got married might
[1:34:52] have done it shouldn't have but but
[1:34:54] she'll tell you we did uh but because
[1:34:57] you know back in condition you don't
[1:35:00] think anything about it and you just you
[1:35:01] know you you walk away from but I knew
[1:35:03] that I knew I knew that you weren't
[1:35:07] supposed to uh even hug another girl
[1:35:11] right another woman cuz she puts that in
[1:35:13] print I heard brother B talk about that
[1:35:15] amen one of my favorite messages was
[1:35:17] blind Bar M by the way and I knew that
[1:35:21] in school so I never went to take
[1:35:23] another girl and bring her in amen
[1:35:28] basically the whole High School I loved
[1:35:30] Sonia and that was uh we weren't always
[1:35:34] together but I I loved her and I believe
[1:35:37] she was going to be my wife U people
[1:35:39] would laugh at us and joke at us as was
[1:35:43] a sophomore she was a freshman oh y'all
[1:35:45] are going to get married blah blah blah
[1:35:47] and she shaking her head you know uh
[1:35:51] makes she get Whiplash and I'm sitting
[1:35:53] there there quietly saying yeah
[1:35:56] we and myself I didn't say it out loud I
[1:35:59] didn't say no cuz I sit there CU I knew
[1:36:02] I just knew how do you know I don't know
[1:36:04] you know you just know when you know you
[1:36:05] know you know you know you
[1:36:08] know well when you know see I think I'm
[1:36:11] sent with a bunch of people that know
[1:36:12] what I'm talking about yes you know I
[1:36:15] knew and when I knew I knew it didn't
[1:36:18] matter what anybody else said they were
[1:36:20] making fun she was saying no and I was
[1:36:22] saying it myself yes we are I don't know
[1:36:26] why I just did and she had never
[1:36:29] intended to get married she had never
[1:36:30] intended to have kids but when God takes
[1:36:33] over when things happen you know praise
[1:36:35] the Lord it it it all works in the Lord
[1:36:38] not not that even at that time we were
[1:36:40] serving the lord we did when we started
[1:36:41] having children but when we got together
[1:36:43] and got married and all we weren't
[1:36:45] serving the lord we weren't Christians
[1:36:47] but see these things I knew I still knew
[1:36:49] I never would take another girl into my
[1:36:51] bosom cuz I knew that that wasn't right
[1:36:53] I listen I heard brother randam say that
[1:36:56] when I was a little kid like Joel and uh
[1:36:58] Gabriel's age I heard that and I knew it
[1:37:01] was right and I never said brother B
[1:37:04] said that makes an imprint on you amen
[1:37:07] and I knew that so I didn't do it praise
[1:37:10] the Lord except for my
[1:37:13] wife because that and those things just
[1:37:16] come and and and and and and even at
[1:37:19] that but when I first gave my heart to
[1:37:22] the Lord and got born born again and
[1:37:24] there were still things the preachers
[1:37:26] would say that I wasn't I remember the
[1:37:28] first time I heard the term manifested
[1:37:30] sons of God I didn't know what that
[1:37:33] was amen I went along with it now I can
[1:37:36] go home and study and say you know look
[1:37:39] and see what it is what what are they
[1:37:41] talking about see you understand what
[1:37:43] I'm saying but as you grow and as you
[1:37:45] get older see now none of those things
[1:37:48] it's not like that's a a a surprise or
[1:37:53] something that I don't know amen I still
[1:37:56] have things on my shelf as I'm sure all
[1:37:58] of you do but those things that you grow
[1:38:02] the Lord entrust you with amen and you
[1:38:04] become uh you become a grown mature
[1:38:08] Christian Jesus Christ learned the
[1:38:11] things by which he suffered amen we read
[1:38:14] that last week we saw that him being
[1:38:17] made perfect and that perfect was not a
[1:38:20] grownup mature perfect but it was a a
[1:38:23] fulfillment or bring to an end or to
[1:38:26] complete I've got it here and mean
[1:38:29] that's what that perfect he's talking
[1:38:30] about Jesus in MA in uh Hebrews 5 was
[1:38:33] that perfect he was perfect sinless
[1:38:36] Perfection completed amen and while he
[1:38:41] was at Calvary and gave up his gave up
[1:38:43] the ghost He before he said it is
[1:38:46] finished it's complete it's done the
[1:38:50] work is over praise the Lord because it
[1:38:53] was done done the work was over amen he
[1:38:55] had done what he was sent here to do and
[1:38:57] the Lord did it through him praise the
[1:39:01] Lord amen I got one more scripture I
[1:39:03] want to read and I'm going to close
[1:39:05] first Corin back over to 1 Corinthians
[1:39:07] chapter
[1:39:15] 13 praise the Lord 1 Corinthians Chapter
[1:39:19] 13 Verse 8
[1:39:24] amen charity never
[1:39:26] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[1:39:29] they shall fail amen amen gifts and
[1:39:33] callings of God the gifts and calling of
[1:39:36] God of God Amen not like we said last
[1:39:41] week where someone just wants to keep
[1:39:43] somebody in their church and they
[1:39:44] appoint them a job no the gifts and
[1:39:47] calling of God are without repentance
[1:39:50] charity never fails but where there's
[1:39:52] prophecies that they shall fail you know
[1:39:55] the one thing that won't
[1:39:56] fail the word amen the word will never
[1:39:59] fail amen prophecies will fail where
[1:40:03] there be tongues they shall cease
[1:40:04] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:40:06] vanish away but what won't vanish away
[1:40:08] what won't fail what won't do uh uh
[1:40:12] cease is the word amen because Christ is
[1:40:16] the word amen for we know in part and we
[1:40:20] prophesy in part in in part
[1:40:24] that's means imp portions brother ROM
[1:40:26] talked about the the the reformers if
[1:40:29] you will to each age He said Each one
[1:40:33] had their had their message and they
[1:40:36] they doubted at the truth and each one
[1:40:39] took and they hit on truth and they left
[1:40:42] it out there there was certain things
[1:40:44] that of course they didn't hit but they
[1:40:46] spoke to their level at that time amen
[1:40:49] that's why this day is the day that the
[1:40:52] bride is to reach full maturity amen
[1:40:55] we're not in we're not in smia we're not
[1:40:59] in thara we're not in Philadelphia we're
[1:41:02] not even in leod deia friend we're in
[1:41:04] the bride age amen and this is a time
[1:41:07] that the bride is to be a mature bride
[1:41:10] remember Christ did not marry a child he
[1:41:13] married a mature woman amen mature woman
[1:41:17] going home amen as a mature woman praise
[1:41:21] the Lord but we know part in part now
[1:41:25] they had their part but when the prophet
[1:41:27] of this day came there was no more in
[1:41:30] part he took all those parts that were
[1:41:32] left out there from all those reformers
[1:41:35] and he brought them all together and he
[1:41:37] and he rightly divided the word out to
[1:41:40] say this was truth this was not this was
[1:41:43] right this was wrong they had a part
[1:41:45] truth but they had a part wrong they had
[1:41:47] the had a part and he took all those
[1:41:50] truths and he brought them all down
[1:41:51] people think that serpent SE was only
[1:41:53] came out in brother B's message that's
[1:41:55] not true at all people have been
[1:41:57] preaching serpent seed for thousands of
[1:41:59] years amen it just took this last day
[1:42:02] Prophet to reach out there and grab it
[1:42:05] and say this is true Saints amen amen
[1:42:09] and we know and Believe by Vindication
[1:42:11] of a prophet that what he spoke to us
[1:42:15] was God's word and we we read it in the
[1:42:17] Bible it witnesses to us when God
[1:42:21] reveals it to us it becomes real
[1:42:24] yes amen it's not just a witness anymore
[1:42:26] it's reality and it becomes real to us
[1:42:29] now there's nothing there's nothing
[1:42:31] anybody could ever say to tell you that
[1:42:33] serpent SE is not true and when people
[1:42:35] say it's not true you can take go back
[1:42:37] to the scripture and say it says right
[1:42:38] there serpent seed his serpent seed what
[1:42:42] is that it's in the Bible and a lot of
[1:42:44] people don't even know that yes they
[1:42:46] don't even know it's
[1:42:47] scriptural praise but yet they'll take
[1:42:49] Trinity when there's not a there's
[1:42:52] there's nothing in the scripture at all
[1:42:54] that speaks about
[1:42:55] Trinity or uses the word
[1:42:57] Trinity and how many other things we
[1:43:00] could talk about but right amen they'll
[1:43:02] take they'll take that hookline and
[1:43:04] sinker but you give them serpy which is
[1:43:06] scriptural amen for we know in part and
[1:43:10] we prophesy in part but when that which
[1:43:12] is perfect is
[1:43:13] come that is mature that is the mature
[1:43:16] perfect that is the full age the Matthew
[1:43:19] 54 that's that perfect when that which
[1:43:22] is perfect mature sure is come that
[1:43:24] which is in part shall be done away with
[1:43:26] or shall be not uh you could say done
[1:43:29] away with as in annihilated it's not
[1:43:32] annihilated but it's it's rendered idle
[1:43:35] at that point amen which means that the
[1:43:39] word takes the
[1:43:40] preeminence the word takes the
[1:43:42] preeminence over a gift any time and to
[1:43:47] my understanding see a lot of people say
[1:43:49] when when the word came then there was
[1:43:52] no more speaking there was no more
[1:43:54] prophesying there was no more of the
[1:43:55] manifestation of these gifts and even
[1:43:58] even brother green talked to brother
[1:44:00] Brown and talked about whether we
[1:44:02] weren't supposed to speak in tongues
[1:44:03] anymore and said I hope I hadn't taught
[1:44:05] that that would be anti- word if I
[1:44:08] taught that right what does that tell us
[1:44:11] that tells us that the the that that
[1:44:13] those gifts tongues included would not
[1:44:16] be done away with or
[1:44:19] annihilated but there has come a time
[1:44:21] now that it took a backseat if you will
[1:44:25] the word is the priority the word is the
[1:44:28] preeminence nothing wrong with speaking
[1:44:30] in tongues nothing wrong with the
[1:44:32] prophecy if it's of God all that all
[1:44:34] that gifts that are in in order are all
[1:44:37] perfectly fine and right in scriptural
[1:44:39] and we
[1:44:41] should I even read a quote where brother
[1:44:43] randam said a church is not manifesting
[1:44:45] the gifts I have a give account of God
[1:44:46] one day God help us I don't want I don't
[1:44:49] want to be that church amen but but we
[1:44:53] know that they're but they they kind of
[1:44:55] take a back seat now the word is come
[1:44:58] front and forward Jesus Christ the word
[1:45:01] is first front forward Paramount amen
[1:45:06] when that is perfect is come that was in
[1:45:08] part of be done away with when I was a
[1:45:10] child I spake as a child understood as a
[1:45:12] child I thought as a child but when I
[1:45:14] became a man I put away childish things
[1:45:17] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:45:20] but then face to face now I know heart
[1:45:23] but then shall I know even as also I am
[1:45:25] known and now abide faith hope charity
[1:45:29] these three but the greatest of them is
[1:45:31] Charity praise the Lord now trying
[1:45:34] trying to do God of service without it
[1:45:35] being his will I want to read a
[1:45:38] couple quotes if I can get through these
[1:45:42] here amen he talked about de David king
[1:45:46] of Israel got the Revelation to bring
[1:45:49] the Ark of the Covenant back to its
[1:45:51] rightful position but they never they
[1:45:54] never consulted in uh God in the days of
[1:45:57] Saul because Saul had backslid so they
[1:46:00] never consulted the ark at all the
[1:46:03] Covenant in the days of Saul because he
[1:46:05] had backslid was gone away from God so
[1:46:09] David quickly with inspiration now
[1:46:11] notice this this it's a very treacherous
[1:46:15] text if you get right down to it he said
[1:46:16] and I feel that the hour is coming where
[1:46:19] we should be men instead of babies
[1:46:22] strong milk instead of
[1:46:23] meat amen turning on the light uh but
[1:46:27] you take the sun it shines in August you
[1:46:30] put it on the wheat today it would kill
[1:46:31] it certainly you can't do that and we're
[1:46:34] talking about that that chokes out
[1:46:36] notice amen you you put the put the
[1:46:39] Noonday sun on a morning plant and it'll
[1:46:42] die it'll kill it he's talking about the
[1:46:45] wheat got coming to the place that it
[1:46:48] would not be able to take the full be
[1:46:50] the full bearance of the sun right uh
[1:46:53] put it on a wheat today it would kill it
[1:46:55] certainly can't do that it must come in
[1:46:57] its season so must God's uh wheat and
[1:47:00] grain ripen just in the season the
[1:47:03] season that it's in see well the wheat
[1:47:06] would die the fruits would die Sun uh by
[1:47:09] the Sun that lives today that sun today
[1:47:11] rather it's coming a harvest is ripening
[1:47:14] the grain should mature with the light
[1:47:18] and it did as we talked about from the
[1:47:20] first church age till this age the
[1:47:22] reform up to the prophet it should
[1:47:25] mature up to this up to this age because
[1:47:28] the grain had to come forth in Pentecost
[1:47:32] dying the ground R so that it could come
[1:47:34] forth again in the maturity of this last
[1:47:36] day the grain should mature with the
[1:47:39] light but that but the thing is today
[1:47:42] the church grain don't want to mature
[1:47:46] the church
[1:47:47] grain it wants to stay like it was back
[1:47:50] in Moody's times uh sanki f Knox Calvin
[1:47:54] they were all right with the light that
[1:47:56] they had God entrusted them with the
[1:48:00] light for that day yes amen he entrusted
[1:48:05] them with the maturity level that they
[1:48:09] had attained at that
[1:48:11] time but this is another hour this is
[1:48:15] another day this is the advancement of
[1:48:19] the Gospel it's coming to its
[1:48:21] maturity so we cannot live on what
[1:48:24] Luther said although Luther said what
[1:48:26] Luther said is right right the just
[1:48:28] shall live by faith amen but you can't
[1:48:31] take that alone amen Wesley said or some
[1:48:35] of the rest of them we're living in the
[1:48:37] light that was predicted for this day
[1:48:40] we're in the seventh Church age that's
[1:48:43] uh not the third fourth Church age grain
[1:48:45] should be able to receive it if it
[1:48:48] doesn't fall off means there's nothing
[1:48:50] to it the grain is matured with the life
[1:48:53] if it goes ahead with the light right
[1:48:56] one last time now in the rising of the
[1:48:58] sun I quoted this one last week I'm
[1:49:00] going to read this we'll uh
[1:49:03] close as Christ was the first one to
[1:49:07] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[1:49:09] also typed in many places he was the
[1:49:12] first fruits of those that slept in the
[1:49:15] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:49:18] church they'll have to be a sheath waved
[1:49:21] again in the last day oh my waving of
[1:49:24] the sheath what was the sheath it was
[1:49:26] the first one to come to maturity first
[1:49:28] one that proved it was a wheat that
[1:49:31] proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm
[1:49:35] sure you see it I'm talking about I was
[1:49:36] waving over the people that probably a
[1:49:38] very minuscal amount of people in that
[1:49:40] service at that time understood what
[1:49:42] brother Brown was talking about amen I I
[1:49:45] think I'm not venturing with authority
[1:49:48] there uh probably I believe that
[1:49:50] probably from those some people that
[1:49:53] were in those meetings and that were a
[1:49:55] part of those things um but I'm sure you
[1:49:58] see what I'm talking about it was waved
[1:50:01] over the people and the first time there
[1:50:03] will come forth for the bride age for a
[1:50:06] resurrection out of dark
[1:50:07] denominationalism will be a
[1:50:09] message praise God there will be a
[1:50:13] message that the full maturity of the
[1:50:15] word has turned back again in its full
[1:50:19] power and being waved over the People by
[1:50:22] the the same signs and wonders that he
[1:50:24] did back there amen praise the Lord
[1:50:27] Jesus you imagine Saints now brother Pat
[1:50:31] doesn't have to imagine he was in some
[1:50:32] of those meetings but could you imagine
[1:50:34] I can only imagine sitting there and
[1:50:36] listening to some of the things that I
[1:50:38] believ that man to be a prophet was
[1:50:41] saying for the first time you're
[1:50:43] listening to things that nobody else had
[1:50:45] ever said
[1:50:46] before again we see it as common a lot
[1:50:49] of times today things that we talk about
[1:50:51] in the message quote unquote
[1:50:54] vernacular but people sitting in these
[1:50:57] meetings that's the first time they ever
[1:50:59] heard anything like that amen and can
[1:51:02] you imagine trying to take those things
[1:51:04] in but he knew brother bandam knew and
[1:51:07] God told him to store up that food amen
[1:51:11] store up that food in storehouses
[1:51:13] because we would need it and that we
[1:51:15] would feed on it and those that were
[1:51:17] there I'm not discounting those that
[1:51:19] were there obviously because they grew I
[1:51:22] I believe they were part of God they
[1:51:24] grew with it too as time went on as
[1:51:27] brother R passed away as they listened
[1:51:29] to the Tes as they remembered back amen
[1:51:32] amen praise the lord it's like I
[1:51:35] remember back the first time I heard
[1:51:37] somebody told me to go get a dead blow I
[1:51:40] look back I remember how confused I was
[1:51:43] how I had no idea what they were talking
[1:51:45] about amen could you imagine for the
[1:51:48] first time many of these people hearing
[1:51:49] things that brother Brown said it was
[1:51:51] the first time they had ever heard
[1:51:52] anything like that says Christians
[1:51:56] ministers I never heard it preached like
[1:51:58] that no wonder they know some you
[1:52:02] believe that was a man sent from God
[1:52:04] right because it it's like they told
[1:52:07] Jesus amen it's like Nicodemus came to
[1:52:10] Jesus at night nobody can see speak like
[1:52:13] you do nobody can do the things you do
[1:52:15] we know you're a man sent from God
[1:52:17] because nobody could have done those
[1:52:18] things like you do except God be with
[1:52:20] him amen a lot of people have left it a
[1:52:24] lot of people have uh been discouraged
[1:52:26] by it but those who know and those who
[1:52:28] believe and those is it's become a part
[1:52:30] of their lives it is truth amen and
[1:52:33] there's no way you can separate them
[1:52:35] from it friend there's no way you can SE
[1:52:38] separate me from that word Amen brother
[1:52:40] Ram's gone absolutely but the word that
[1:52:42] was left that God spoke through to
[1:52:45] through him to me is still here because
[1:52:49] I'm here amen amen it's still here
[1:52:51] because you're here not just because the
[1:52:53] tapes are here and every other version
[1:52:55] that we could think of but because we're
[1:52:57] here as long as you're here the word's
[1:53:00] here praise the Lord and that word will
[1:53:02] be manifested as long as it's continued
[1:53:04] to be manifested in Us Praise the Lord
[1:53:07] and and the more we continue to grow yes
[1:53:10] another thing don't ever become
[1:53:12] complacent yes don't ever I've seen
[1:53:15] people it seems like sometimes they get
[1:53:16] so complacent like well you know I I
[1:53:20] I've learned enough I know enough I've
[1:53:21] gone to church I got it I get it I
[1:53:24] understand I know I just leave me alone
[1:53:26] now and and that's maybe not exactly
[1:53:29] their words but sort of their attitude
[1:53:31] yes amen and that is a horrible attitude
[1:53:34] because we will always continue to grow
[1:53:36] God will always continue to unfold
[1:53:39] brother bandom said God will continue to
[1:53:41] unfold things to us through
[1:53:44] eternity so how dare we think we can we
[1:53:47] know it all now amen amen God will
[1:53:50] continue to show us and reveal it to us
[1:53:52] Us Praise the Lord amen let's stand if
[1:53:55] we
[1:53:59] could praise the
[1:54:05] Lord let God continue to reveal it to
[1:54:08] your life amen continue to reveal it to
[1:54:12] your souls grow in the Lord grow in
[1:54:16] Grace we've gotten to that place of
[1:54:18] maturity of the grown woman that God
[1:54:22] that he would marry the grown woman that
[1:54:24] he would call his wife call his bride
[1:54:28] amen we hadn't seen this little course
[1:54:31] in a while came to my heart
[1:54:33] here amen I'm trying to remember the
[1:54:35] name of it I know where it is in here if
[1:54:36] I can find it real quick

[1:58:15] it's kind of a lengthy week didn't have
[1:58:17] quite as many hours in this week but uh
[1:58:20] um it was still uh
[1:58:22] had 14 133 hour days and so it's kind of
[1:58:26] lengthy but it's just the that way with
[1:58:29] the what we call a CeX we work on
[1:58:33] existing um existing washes that need
[1:58:36] specific things upgrades and all done so
[1:58:39] uh but it it was a good week I
[1:58:41] appreciate the flights were good um it
[1:58:44] would just U did nonstops to Atlanta and
[1:58:47] back and there were good flights and on
[1:58:50] time and so uh appreciate the Lord and
[1:58:52] appreciate all your prayers for us
[1:58:54] keeping us safe and healthy amen praise
[1:58:57] the lord we were uh we were in we were
[1:59:00] in Georgia when I learned of two people
[1:59:03] dying right here in Mor a plane crash so
[1:59:07] you know when I when I say I'm thankful
[1:59:10] for the safety and I mean it I'm very
[1:59:13] thankful your prayers uh was it this
[1:59:16] week I can't remember maybe it was this
[1:59:18] week too where the plane landed in
[1:59:19] Toronto and flipped over amen I mean I
[1:59:22] believe all those people lived three
[1:59:24] were
[1:59:25] critical no none of them died so
[1:59:28] thankfully all of them lived but could
[1:59:30] you imagine I still don't want to go
[1:59:32] through that it was
[1:59:34] a I I did notice one thing on this last
[1:59:36] flight people had their belts and were
[1:59:39] tightening them up sometimes people are
[1:59:41] getting kind of not not quite as uh
[1:59:45] serious about them but it looked like on
[1:59:47] these last flights people were just at
[1:59:49] least yesterday they were tighten them
[1:59:51] down amen cuz uh uh you never know you
[1:59:55] just never know plane lands and flipped
[1:59:58] and it's on its top before you know
[2:00:00] what's going on Amen but I appreciate it
[2:00:04] and I I don't take it lightly I'm very
[2:00:06] thankful to your prayers for the Lord's
[2:00:08] course too then so I'm not sure about
[2:00:10] next week we're supposed to go to
[2:00:12] California but it depends on the flight
[2:00:14] he gives me uh there's a flight that
[2:00:16] leaves at 1 12:55 and one that and one
[2:00:20] that leaves later so I'm not sure
[2:00:22] we'll see what happens because I told
[2:00:24] him I can do 1:00 so we'll see if he has
[2:00:27] to put me in the other local guy dug
[2:00:30] together uh to to fly together and to be
[2:00:34] in the same car to make it cheaper for
[2:00:36] the company I'll Pro that's probably
[2:00:37] what you'll do uh but I'll let you know
[2:00:40] uh far enough ahead of time so that you
[2:00:43] know what's going on whether we need to
[2:00:44] do uh the early uh earlier service or
[2:00:47] not so after that going to Minneapolis
[2:00:50] and there shouldn't have to there
[2:00:52] shouldn't be any early Services there
[2:00:53] because it's 2 o' I think it's the
[2:00:55] flight that goes nonstop to
[2:00:57] Minneapolis right there so but anyway
[2:01:00] just to let you know if anything changes
[2:01:03] I will let you know yes so amen so
[2:01:06] praise the Lord if anybody is everybody
[2:01:08] still getting the text the uh okay I'm
[2:01:11] making sure I think I finally figured
[2:01:14] out how to text because see I got I'm
[2:01:17] sorry to keep you but I got I've had
[2:01:19] questions I had I've got groups that I
[2:01:22] need to interact with as a
[2:01:24] group but us uh I just send out a blast
[2:01:28] for all of you and if you respond I just
[2:01:31] want your response to come to me well
[2:01:34] since Verizon cancelled and uh got rid
[2:01:37] of their messaging where it I could just
[2:01:41] said it and it did that the way I wanted
[2:01:43] it for each text group this new one
[2:01:46] Google uh it doesn't do that I have to
[2:01:49] change it every time so last week when I
[2:01:53] changed it I did change it but I changed
[2:01:55] the wrong thing to make it to where uh
[2:01:58] our that message I sent out would just
[2:02:00] be a response back to me and not
