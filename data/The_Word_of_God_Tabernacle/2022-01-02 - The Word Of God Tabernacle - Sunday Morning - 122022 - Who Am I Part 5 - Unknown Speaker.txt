amen so thankful today amen we got a couple prayer requests i want to read to us amen this morning i have a couple also on my heart i want to give we uh want to remember the sotelo's in prayer of course please continue to pray earnestly i had we haven't heard from sister teresa today but as of yesterday brother charlie was uh in her words doing a little better even though she said his oxygen levels were in the 70s but he is in the hospital excuse me he is still sedated uh and in the hospital i do not believe he is on a ventilator intubated or any of that but he is sedated and he's just his body's recovering so please remember him in prayer sister teresa of course dealing with the after effects and those of you who have had it you know the coughing and the congestion and the and all that that goes with it she's dealing with that and it's you know it gets pretty cumbersome and you continue to cough and you're at the hospital and you're trying to be with your husband and uh so please remember sister teresa and brother charlie in prayer uh if you would also got a text from brother wilson henry today and he informed me that a good friend of his and a friend of mine uh j.t padgett from back in back east uh had a stroke and was in the hospital uh it sounds like he's gonna be able to uh i guess not get out today but tomorrow they were hoping today but he said his blood pressure and all was too high so they want to keep them another day but named jt pageant if you would uh just lift his name up in prayer before the lord he's doing okay but you know like all of us and he's about i think he's about brother wilson's age ish but uh precious brother faithful brother uh minister back in north carolina so i would appreciate your prayers for him as well amen brother dennis put in a request said to please remember his wife liam prayer she now retired end of the year into the end of her vocation she's now retired worried about what she's going to do with all our spare time now pray for comfort and peace with the anxiety she's going through amen that's that's a tough one to try to tackle but amen i'm sure she'll figure it out amen right brother dennis but we do want to remember sister leah in prayer lord would just touch her that you know when you do something all your life and it just becomes routine a part of life when that part changes kind of throws you for a loop a little bit so just pray the lord and some people don't adjust to that well some people would retire or force retired or whatever and they just don't adjust to that very well i was working for an old client and sonya works a little bit for her now mary and her son doesn't want her to work anymore i said well what do you want to do i said you need to do what makes you happy if working makes you happy then go to work forget about him if that's what makes you happy if that's what you want to do do that if you want to sit around and play cards or bingo or something or go socialize and spend time with your friends go to senior center and all that then do that that's fine that's kind of what he wants her to do but i said but if you want to work and that's what gives you pleasure do that work work till you're horizontal amendments praise the lord i mean that's what i plan to do i don't know that's always going to be electric but i'll probably be here till i'm horizontal anyway ministering i don't know about pastoring but i'll be ministering all my life as far as i'm concerned so he missed i just said work so you never know some people you know some people are golfers and skiers and some people uh aren't some people are digging in the earth and taking care of business every day so and that's what keeps them alive amen praise the lord i told brother pat how many times he's tore down and put that car back together seems like a waste no it's not it's keeping you alive keeping the blood pumping keeping the muscles going amen absolutely praise the lord there's nothing wrong with that amen micah has a request here says please remember a friend he said i don't know her name but she is in the icu and expected to by the medical staff to die of the flu she is only 42. i believe if god sees fit to raise her up that i can witness to my friends that we prayed for her and that there is a god amen miracle working god praise the lord also micah has here as most of you know i write and arrange music for small and large orchestras i've published several arrangements uh this past week and if it be the will of the lord i ask that the music will sell to generate income for me and my family amen praise the lord so remember those requests prayer amen anybody have an unspoken request on your heart amen praise the lord god knows all about it let's stand to our feet if we could as i said last sunday i want to i want to try to just get to writing our requests down you write down a request you write down a song request or something you want to sing or testimony or something just write them down and leave them on the table over there once you're once you're done or if you write them on a separate paper like sister matisse wrote hers out ahead of time or something set it back on the table back there and we'll get it before church i'll grab it or when my buddy gets uh his foot back well again to walk around he'll go around there and get them for us so so just do that and we'll keep i'm going to try to keep on that so we stay with that amen brother dennis would you pray for us brother lord jesus we borrow our hearts and heads to your presence that's made known to us already for you said when two or three are gathered in your name you'll be in an army yes lord god and that's why we're here father not to be seen or to see one another but to meet with you [Music] that is is concerned and mindful of the needs of your people that another year has come father and as your prophet said never lose your enthusiasm for the coming of the lord jesus and lord may that speak to our hearts and volumes we know that each year that is our pastor said already that whatever time it's going to take may we be faithful rooted and grounded in the faith and in your word knowing lord this is not a time to play church this is not a time to think that oh he won't come for a long time many years ahead lord that's the lie of the devil because as your prophet said when he was alive i cannot see anything that can stop the coming of the lord and that's been 56 57 years ago and we can stand by it even that much more right now yes i that your coming could even um be real today and lord there are needs of that's been expressed by your saints this morning lord there's many that need a healing touch for we know you're mindful of each and every one of your children may you come on the scene you are a great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities our brother um charlie father and and sister teresa and our brother um i can't patent or iron and all the other ones that's been read and all the hearts that's been uh raised up to you you know what they're asking we know father greater he that's in us than heeders in the world you are a great supplier of our needs you no matter what the devil throws at us we know that when he comes in like a flood you'll raise that standard and father touch each and every one may our hearts burn with within us as we meet with you along the way this morning father may our needs be met may the testimonies come forth that jesus is still alive alive in the hearts of his people for you're truly the same yesterday today and forever meet every knee according to your riches and glory glory father for you're the god of mercy you're the god of compassion you're the god that loves his people and he will not leave us defeated you will have a victorious uh church that will stand for your word yes the very end amen lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord you can be seated if you'd like amen thank you jesus praise the lord i had a song i wanted to sing it's not going to be on the um on the screen i forgot to give it to mike but something i didn't forget and just something that the lord put on my heart this morning and it's psalm number 314 amen it is in the song book so psalm number 314 in the book amen that's just his way telling me he loves me amen thank you jesus thankful he watches over us yes amen he's always there never [Music] that's just his way of telling me he loves me it's a love beyond all you must understand [Music] trials that bring me to my knees that's [Music] he lets me walk down disappointment he watches and he knows what's best for me the more i've tried the better he can hold me and change my life completely that it will fit his perfect will oh that's just his way of telling me he loves me [Music] it's a love beyond all human understanding and i won't question trials that bring me to my knees that's just his way all telling me he loves me if i'm successful walking through this valley you give me strength to climb the highest hill and my greatest strength comes through my darkest triangle listen now and my greatest joy is knowing that he can trust in me amen oh that's just his way of telling me he loves me well it's [Music] trials that bring me to my knees that's just his way of telling me he loves me again together now oh that's just his way of telling me he loves me well it's a love beyond all human understand and i won't question trials that bring me to my knees that's just his way of telling me he loves me amen amen praise the lord jesus sometimes so many times we don't understand it saying it doesn't make sense the way the lord chooses to do things sometimes but i can guarantee you and promise you one thing he does it because he loves you amen amen and we believe that because we love him amen amen it's a relationship beyond all of understanding praise the lord jesus amen sister matisse wrote out a testimony that i wanted to read here i mean it says happy new year this hebrew years the year of the mouth we shall speak a thing amen i do that all the time praise the lord being a christian i speak all the time um weather news said rain floods i praise god for his grace and mercy to forbid the eight inches of rain in this area and the catalinas with flooding i ask a group to pray together god is so merciful amen praise the lord god knows amen he is so good isn't he yes he answers prayer amen he hears your prayer he answers prayer praise the lord micah has a song he wants to sing to us now so we'll go ahead and be on the screen there if you want to sing along i didn't know if tapped or zach wanted to do an update on joel and the good news and everything the doctor and how he's acting or i can do it or joke don't want me to just do it sure uh well i wasn't there at the doctor but mama and tabitha were there and the surgeon said he's doing very very very good and he can start putting pressure and do with it as he feels comfortable um he's almost back to the same old jewel he was before yesterday we were watching him because he gets scared of pain sometimes so he doesn't always do what he can do but he'll be playing with his sister and pushing off of it and moving it around almost as if nothing's wrong so we want to thank the lord for that spirit believing that it's going to be back to normal in no time amen praise the lord i sing this song a couple of times a couple weeks ago but i it's been on my heart even still since and i thought this would be a good anthem for the new year just for us to remember that there's nothing we can ask too much of jesus and god healing finances whatever it may be if you know it i know joel knows it he's been singing along with me but if you know it feel free to sing along [Music] when david gathered a handful of stars where the soldiers had fallen he waited alone with a prayer and a little rock the giant on the well that's what david prayed for yes and that's what david got you can't have so much of my car no you can't ask too much of my god there was a woman drawing water from the well she had so many regrets so often she [Music] too much of my heart amen no you can't ask too much [Music] and you cannot find a peace of mind that seems to [Music] of leave the great i am [Music] amen and you can't ask too much [Music] upon the three hebrew children god's smile and when sarah was 19 god gave her a child now i believe that justin's there he's here to move like [Music] no you can't [Music] [Music] greater than all the problems [Music] and you cannot find a peace of mind that seems to leave [Music] too much of my heart amen [Music] no you can't ask too much yes praise the lord amen [Applause] amen my my saints how true that is amen you believe that very much praise the lord can't ask too much of him praise the lord he is the miracle-working god so thankful for that amen praise the lord jesus he's still present he's still the same yesterday today and forever he never changes he promised to always be with us and he is amen we know he is praise the lord let's stand to our feet now amen we'll change your service and i'll be uh perfectly frank with you i had something i was going to speak on today and i feel like the lord changed it a little bit so i will put it out here and see what he says whichever way the lord leads it that's where i plan to go so amen that's sometimes that's just all i know to do but we'll do the best we can amen amen praise the lord we're going to go though in the scripture first to genesis chapter 1 and we're going to read the first verse of genesis chapter one praise the lord amen genesis chapter 1 verses 1 and 2. before we read though we just bow our heads for another word of prayer amen lord jesus father it is it is such a privilege lord to come to the house of god again so thankful that we can open up a new year lord in the house of god no better place i could think of than to be in the house of god lord and i i am absolutely positive brother charlie wasn't in the hospital he'd much rather be here lord in the house of god and i'm so thankful father for those that have come and for those who may be watching lord and for your presence most of all because we know that you're here you promised you'd be here truthfully are gathered in your name there's more than that here today god we're here in your name and trusting you to be with us and to speak to us and to move among us lord and to touch every hearted life and fill this place as you did on the day of pentecost and fill all the house and fill everyone lord and god just have your will away in every situation circumstance of every life heal every sick body meet every need move lord as you have always done and will continue to do among your people that lord we could be obedient to your word and be led by your spirit that your perfect will would be done in all of our lives we thank you lord for this time of fellowship and lord to be able to open up this book lord this bible this precious holy writ that you've given us yes god thank you for the ability to be able to worship freely lord to speak of you freely to come in together lord without threat of violence or or hindrance or imprisonment lord and just worship you and serve you and and read this bible and to learn of you and for your holy spirit to come and lord have its preeminence now we are truly a blessed people we thank you so much lord for what you did for us in 2021 but god were looking for greater things in 2022. god greater things more lord as your scripture says greater shall they do lord brother branham came and told us that's more you can't do anything greater than raising the dead but more shall we do i'm looking for more yes but it's only in you god because we can't do the more you have to do it but we want to be instruments of yours to use to do it through so god may you grant it begin here lord we're in your hands we're in this service we're trusting you once again your holy spirit to anoint speaker in here alike we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and the honor and the praise for all that is said and done take control of this lord this service now as we committed to you and ask your blessings upon it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen genesis chapter 1 we'll begin reading with verse 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you'd like and god created the heaven and the earth of course the bible says in the beginning we've been dealing on the who am i uh not really sure what we're going to title this today but we've been dealing with who am i and my intention and my study yesterday was to kind of finish that up today uh but after this morning and in my prayer i kind of felt something different a little bit and then when i started looking at it i thought well lord you can we can just bring these two together because it kind of run congruently so again we'll just see whatever the lord has in store and where he wants to take it from here so we look at the bible it says in the beginning now we know in the beginning god god created the heavenly earth so many times again we have to use the verbiage in the beginning because you know our little human pee brains can't even begin to fathom what eternity is and the fact that they're never really in here was the beginning but for scripture purposes and for our purposes we look at in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the water and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water now we know the transition period that made the difference here was the fact that god spoke and when god's word came out and understanding here that the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters that when that when that logos came out of god and began to brood over the earth it was that word it was that presence it was that thought as we know the the logos that thought or concept that came out of god uh basically god's intellectual property like we've been talking about through this series the thought of god the logos of god that came out of him that was expressed forth from god that brewed upon this earth that that changed this earth because it was without form and void and darkness covered everything friend that sounded like me before i became a christian i was void i was worthless i was wasteland i was nothing but total darkness but then the spirit of god come and moved on me and you and that's why we're here today and when the spirit of god moved it changed us it developed and come into something that was be pleasing to the lord something that was beautiful in the eyes of the lord and that was his purpose but we have to be continually willing in this new year willing to be molded and shaped into the image of god yes we know we've talked about that seed that's inside but you know we also understand that in this life and fulfilling the purpose of god in our lives through that adoption that that we have that purpose in our own body in our own flesh to be able to fulfill jesus came god that logos came down and manifested itself in the body of jesus christ so that it might fulfill the purpose of what that body came to do well if it was to fulfill the purpose that that body came to do then can't we allow it and even more this year to allow it that that that logos would continue to come and brood through us and fulfill that purpose that he called for me and for you to do that's the whole point to make it more than what it seems more than what the world would say or more than what the world would determine but what god almighty has determined when god before the foundation the world put your name in the lamb's book of life he had a purpose for you he had a reason for you and like i said when we first opened the service here you know we're in a new year and if the lord doesn't come this year i agree with brother tom's prayer and i'm looking for him this year but if he doesn't come this year i want to do one thing and that's to become closer to him i want to become more like the lord jesus i don't want this to be just a wasted void dark year i want it to be a year of of joy and of happiness and of and of growing closer to god fulfilling god's purpose in my life letting him take full control but now with that spirit let's look at this now with that spirit that logos came out of god and began to move upon the earth it began to brood over the earth it reached the place through the light and through the heavens and through the earth and through the seas and the firmaments and all god come to the 26th verse and he said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth god made us in his own image he purposely made us that way now that was spirit man that god originally made because god is a spirit and he made us that spirit well what was that that was nothing more than god himself coming in and producing the result that he desired to see when he made us man woman he made us in his mind that's what he desired to see so that's what he produced that's what he spoke and when he spoke it it came to pass but he made us in that image you can understand even even all humans not just christians are made in the image of god everyone by that spirit man that god had formed in the beginning so god created man in his own image praise the lord i thank god that i am in his own image in his own likeness that helps me to understand that i can get closer to him you know brother bannon said if you want more of god all that proves if there's more of god for you to have yes amen and if there's more of god for us to have friends why would we want it it's so sad and i'm sorry but it just burns my heart so much when i see a person or you see it a situation where people it's almost like they become content to the point or not content we're supposed to be content but complacent that everything is okay it's like people sometimes feel like they've reached that pinnacle and i'll just coast my way into heaven it doesn't work that way we must continue to press and fight the good fight of faith to press this battle and to obey god's word and you know brother adam said if you want to get closer to god we know what the formula is read your bible and pray every day right you want to get closer to god so in my exclamation this morning and my desire to be closer to him comes with a recipe yes and that is to get closer to him by reading my bible and praying every day that's the prescription that's the recipe if you go to make a cake and you look and it says two pounds of sugar and you put two pounds of salt that cake's not gonna be fifteen amen you gotta do it the way it says to do it right you got to follow the recipe the way that it's laid out yes if you put in the ingredients you think well i think we should have six eggs instead of two i i think we should have uh 10 pounds of flour instead of a half a pound or or we should have a two cups of salt or pepper let's just put some habanero in there that's going to be the nastiest cake you ever tried to put in your mouth yes but if you follow the recipe if you follow the prescription see and that's god is molding us and making us and shaping us into his own image the way he wants us to be he is the potter we are the clay we are to die to ourselves that god can be allowed to mold us the way he wants us and this new year friend if there's ever a revolution or resolution that we should have it is that god mold me more this year help me to get closer to you i don't want to become complacent i don't want to get eased in zion i don't want to get to the place that i feel like i'm comfortable and i'm okay god i'm good you can leave me alone now no i don't want that right sometimes it takes a a mountain sometimes it takes a a cutting sometimes it takes a shaping or a molding and it doesn't feel good but god does it for our own good because that's just his way of showing me he loves me because he wants me going down the right path if he knows this is going to cause me to go down the wrong path he's going to do something to cause me to go down the right path amen because he knows down the road what it's going to end up being but i don't want to become complacent i was oh i'm in the message who cares okay fine what does that mean right i mean you know i i i don't mean this sacrilegious friend but some people come and that's their whole moniker right right it's like brother adam asked those people are you a christian oh i light a candle every night well what's that got to do with it right i ask another lady are you a christian oh i'm methodist like what has that got to do with being a christian it's almost today he goes oh i'm in the message that's not what i wanted to know right right are you a christian that's what i want to know amen amen now i believe if you're a true godly christian fuel the holy ghost it'll lead you into that word right into that message which is christ but people use it as a moniker of of some kind of covering like a religion friend if we're not getting closer to christ every day we're losing ground every day that's right we should be working and and striving to get more like him every single day he made us in his own image he created us in his own likeness male and female created he them male infant male and feminist spirit he created us so what is our responsibility this continued to press forward and and that that gods give us to do we we we went through this chart that we had last week ephesians how paul laid this out from before the foundation of the world and in the mind of god and predestinated coming to this earth and god redeeming us back to himself revealing himself and his word to us so we can grow in grace and then bringing us to an end to an inheritance back to him again amen hallelujah praise the lord all this god's taken care of but what about this part here in the middle that we're responsible for we're responsible for this part here yes amen god did the redemptive plan we have to receive it and accept it and become it so that that revelation of the word could come and reveal itself to you that you can grow in grace in the knowledge of the lord jesus that's how we grow that that word is revealed it becomes a part of us it comes to that place where brother adam said god didn't just have a human cell and then a pig sell and then a dog sell and then a cat sell and then a crow sail no no it's a human cell and sell themselves if it's god it's cell on cell and so when god's creating in the womb of a woman he's creating a human being it's a human cell on top of a human cell on top of a human cell well he's doing the same thing with us i'll praise the lord it's got to be word on top of a word on top of word for it to be a word body right yes to be a word individual and the growth stops when we're horizontal amen or god takes us from this earth in a rapture right which is what i'm looking forward to first and foremost god may choose me to take the other way and that's his choice and i'm okay with that but i sure would like to see that rapture i sure would like to be a part of that alive and remain group right but if it's not his will that's okay but i want to grow and grow and grow and be into the place that i get so close to god that people can't tell the difference between me and him you know what happens when they can't tell the difference between you and christ that's when they start to really persecute you right that's when they really start to hate you amen that's when they get him right the more christ lived his life and the more in the image of his father he became and the more of the works of god he did people begin to hate him more and more and more till it led them to a crucifixion amen you get to that place friend people are going to hate you more and more and more let's go to let's go to saint john chapter one this is not a resolution or a rev um a new year's resolution i'm trying to straighten my grammar a little better i personally don't like hearing people say i'm going to i am going to go to you here people who are supposed to be professional speakers and i'm going to if you're getting 250 000 a year to talk at least talk right if i gotta listen to you at least say it correctly so i'm trying my best i know i'm as guilty as anybody but i'm trying my best go to not go to yeah but you know i was raised in a home where when you walk through the when you walk through the door your sister would say cut on the light right you got a knife if you got a knife i'll cut it on so so give me a little bit of slack uh sometimes you you got to grow out of certain things so i'm trying to not say those things that way so we're going to saint john chapter one saint john chapter one i know i'll fall many times so forgive me if i do but i'll try to correct it if i do saint john 1 1. in the beginning was the word that's the logos it meant the word the logos it came out of god that intellectual property that came out of god the word and the word was with god and the word was god people say i wonder who them them was well it's god amen that's that's all the them is people want to go back to the scripture we read in genesis as justifying the trinity and saying see there he said them who do you think god is that's who he is amen but without a revelation you you won't see it can't see it the word the logos was with god and the logos the word was god amen the same was in the beginning with god that same that logos that word because it is god it is him it is with him it is him doing it it's all him amen so that logos but that logos was just that intellectual property that that that part of god that came out of god yes and and again brood over the earth this logos became manifest when he stood in the flesh of melchizedek it manifested itself when it when it stood in the flesh of the the one that came to abraham uh it visited us when it came in the form of uh uh jesus christ of course now it took on many other forms uh it used to lead the children of israel a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night same one it's still god still low god still god leading his children it came when paul was struck down on the road and and he said why persecutest thou me he said who are you great like i am jesus who you persecute yeah in the beginning was the word the logos came out of god it's the same god it brewed over the earth changed all the earth to what we live in today it's doing the same thing now it's shining his light look at this all things were made by him which we read over in ephesians and and i haven't read colossians but uh all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life now brother adam tells us that life is zoe of course you go look at the greek you see z-o-e zoe i think it's pronounced a little differently in the hebrew but i'll say it the way he said zoe which is as he taught us the literal life of god the literal life of god not figurative this is not an allegory this is literal zoe the literal life of god in him was that life and the life was what the light of man amen that light that come to shine upon our pathway the same life that led the children of israel the same life that struck paul down the same light that came to you and i the same light that's in the pictures with brother branham over his head and on his shoulders the same light same light that came on the day of pentecost the same light that comes in our services friend whether you can visibly see it or not it is here amen it's that light that light is the light of men that light lights up our pathway and even if it's just a step at a time that light lights up our pathway it brings us to that place now that light is to shine or make manifest now what does the world hate the most light people of the world ungodly heathen demonic spirits people hate light more than anything right because it exposes their deeds their deeds that are wicked and evil it exposes them so when you are that light which is the life and you become brighter and your life becomes more like god and that light shines through you do you think the world is going to enjoy when their deeds are exposed by you look i i i gotta say this and i i'm just i'm just saying what the lord puts on my heart amen yes but that's why and this man by no means was uh a saint but that's why they hated donald trump so much because what he did was uncover a lot of the darkness that we already knew was there i mean you know the politics i mean for years and years and years politics is just as crooked as a three dollar bill on the dolphin leg it's always been crooked we know that it's just getting worse because the spirit of darkness is infiltrating in this earth even more but they hated him because he exposed that right he he brought light on that and that little bit of light that i believe god allowed to be shot on that corrupt stuff was the biggest reason they hated the man so much amen good bad you like him not like him a great president bad president good policies bad policies whatever you want to think about the man he brought light upon all the darkness up in that swamp yes and they hated him for it and they'll hate you the same way yes you've become more like the light you become more like god you know brother bran don't don't take this wrong but you know brother branham said it that about people worshiping him and baptizing in his name which we know is heathenism that brother random fought his entire life for the snake he cut the head off the snake and it wiggled into into water remember the vision yes cut the head off it wiggled it into water what's water it's multitudes of people so that just went into the people so these people still do that but you know what he said he said if if that wasn't going on i'd have to repent for my ministry sure he said i wouldn't consider myself living as close to jesus christ as i should be if people didn't miss if people did not mistake me for him he would not be fulfilling the ministry god gave him right that's pretty close friend amen what better thing for any of us to aspire to now i hope you understand what i'm talking about we're not calling brother brown of god by no means neither was he doing that in himself but he's helping us understand that the calling in his life was to bring him to a place that he would manifest christ so closely that people could see christ not brother brown that's why brother random all the time was continuously pointing us to christ every bit every chance he could people say oh he considered him no he didn't if you ever listen to those tapes you'll see how hard brother branham fought that spirit and how much he tried to turn the hearts of the people to christ not himself john the baptist did the same thing to the point john said i'm going to decrease so that he increases yes i'm the i i was i was praying yesterday i said got it i don't know how many more years he's got for me or maybe it was this morning and but i feel like brother brown did brother random got up in 40 44 45 and he's passed when he's 56 is that right did he diamond he's 56 i've just turned 56 and i thought lord i feel kind of like he just said you if you're going to do anything for god to better get busy right but i thought what better thing to do than just continue to grow closer to him and more like him and that way he'll lead me and lead us and the place that he wants us to be and what he wants us to do amen we can't manufacture anything brother brown couldn't manufacture anything he couldn't make anything happen we just do it as god leads us into doing it as the holy spirit brings us in the position of being able to fulfill that that's our only position that's what we do because that's who we are by the grace of god but that light that lights our path that light that is the life of men that illuminates from each one that is born again of the spirit of god reflects jesus christ now i know a lot of times some of the things that we say or do or the attitudes we take or spirits that we project or sometimes a little uh a temper or something it's far from that but god help us to continue to be molded to get away from that right not excuse it see that's the thing some time that you hear people they want to excuse well my mama well my daddy no no no i'm not i'm not concerned about your mom and daddy what i'm concerned about is your daddy the lord jesus christ god almighty that's who i'm concerned about your life oh my daddy had a temper so yeah so amen we we have broke that to come through to to reflect christ and even when they spit in his face and he hit him upside the head and ridiculed and scored him and embarrassed him he did not fight back he held his peace right amen god help us amen there's a time to fight there's a time to hold your peace amen but help me to grow to be more like him so that we don't get into our flesh so much we don't get into our spirit so much but we allow that seed that germatized seed that's down on the inside of the inside to to grow and continue to grow and take control over our lives to take precedent in our lives so that we grow to the place that god is pleased with what we're doing it's that zoe life that literal life of god that that was made that life that light that was in us the light shineth in the darkness the darkness comprehended that not right amen they don't want to have anything to do with it 11th verse he came unto his own now saying saint john 1 11 he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave ye power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name now many people think that believing jesus is saying i believe well the devil believes what else you got for me but that's what a lot of people hang their eternal salvation on oh i believe jesus so does the devil what do you do about it you know how to receive christ is by receiving his word yes you know who you know how to believe he who has sent him is by believing those whom he has sent amen and do you believe that that would be the question do you believe that or do you not yes do you believe god sent a prophet in this last day or do you not do you believe jesus christ came to fulfill all the word or do you not well if he did then to receive him is to receive this word if you don't receive this word you know i don't care how many times how much you express it with your lips that you believe jesus you are not a recipient of that spirit you cannot be if you're disobeying the word to receive him as to receive this the word to receive him as to receive him whom he has sent right amen thank god because that puts us in a position of being able to to be a recipient as many as received him notice it didn't say believed him it said received him praise the lord and you know brother ram talked about you know the lord came into your home and so you're welcome in every room lord except this one over here don't you dare go in there well he's not welcome i'm sure maybe you've been in a home where you go in there and you you're scared to death to sit down or when you when you go somewhere that you're welcome you feel welcome right you know i go to zach's house tabitha's i go in it if i want a bottle of water i go to the fridge and get a bottle of water if i own a cup of coffee i go get a pot and i go to the keurig and i make sure it's got water and i make y'all make me a cup of coffee go to the fridge get some creamer i do because i'm at home i feel welcome there praise the lord but sometimes you go places you're like you you sit down like you're in a museum you can't budge because you don't feel welcome right and that's and that's what christ is in a lot of people's lives he's not welcome oh they said oh come in lord and he'll come in brother said he'll go anywhere he's invited even when he knows he's not welcome jesus with dirty feet am i amen he was invited and he went he accepted the invitation and showed up even knowing that he wasn't going to be made welcome and he wasn't set up in the corner jesus dirty feet all the dignitaries and the rich and smart men standing there and flaunting their wealth and all and he's sitting over there in the corner god almighty with dirty feet and nobody to wash them hey man if i've been there been a different story but you know friend we've got the opportunity today to wash his feet when the world dirties them up when the world don't seem to care when they flop in front of you all of the wealth and the wisdom and all the things that the world has to offer we sat there humbled and contrited the feet of christ washing his feet amen believing and knowing that god is going to honor that because he does he honors that in our lives and and makes sure that we recognize that position so it was easy welcome and that's what we want to make sure today is he welcome right is he welcome in our lives is he welcome in our hearts are we welcoming him with the word are we welcoming him with his spirit are we welcoming him of everything that we do in our lives to make sure that we don't do anything to displease him or cause that spirit that anointing to take its flight amen but make sure that the lord stays present with us amen he is always there many has received him that's receiving praise the lord that's different than believing and believing will bring you to receiving but receiving is actually taking him into your home and him feeling welcome to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word praise the lord that word that logos now has come and it was made flesh and it dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that word that logos came into flesh human flesh not melchizedek flesh not that came to abraham flesh but in the flesh of kinfolk to you and me through the womb of a woman he placed his spirit in there the only way he could do it to redeem us back to him was to become one of us to become like us to become kinfolk the only way redemption can happen in the old testament is to go is for it to be a kinsmen redeemer only way god's plan of redemption the only way he had to become a kinfolk to you and me he had to be one of us he had to be like us in in us forming into that very image oh praise the lord look at this modern events made clear by prophecy december 6 1965. now notice brother branham made a specific title to this modern events made clear by prophecy not prophecy made clear by modern events a lot of times especially these modern day prophets they do just the opposite of what a true god called word prophet does right oh god called word prophet has the modern events become clear by prophecy not the other way around yes prophecy does not become clear by modern events but modern events are made clear about prophecy that's why he titled it as such there's a difference amen listen now for uh for you're a gene of your father you were in your father yet you had no fellowship with it because uh you was in there but you but you knew it not and he knew it not but you was manifested made known brought forth that you might that he might fellowship with you and you being born again you're born of eternal life look at this now born of eternal life and that's the only one form of eternal life that's god's life remember we got into the eternal life that eternal life what is that eternal life god's life the only form of eternity there is is god so that that eternity that uh that god is that life that zoey he says you are born of that eternal life not born into that eternal life because that's contrary you can't do that a birth denotes a beginning a beginning has an end but you are born of that eternity like we said the the great sphere of eternity going around in its eternal circle as god continues to unfold through it and then down on this little corner a blip comes out that's time and it comes off of that eternity well that he turned that time will blend right back into that eternity again but where we are is of that eternity yes we're down in this uh time element life but it's from or of that eternal life you we me oh we are of that eternal life amen and that's the only one form of eternal life that's god's life zoe the greek word zoe only one form of eternal life then if you are a son of god or a daughter of god you are in god all the time praise the lord in him all the time that's how he could be manifested through us now where do we get to okay now we've got to the place that we're at this we're at this end of time end of time for me end of time for time end of time for uh the rapture whatever that might be fulfilled in our lives because the end of time for me might be different than you might be all together it might be we're all going to rapture together that end might come at that time for us now it's not the end of time time it's just the end of time for you amen because time continues on even after armageddon even after the millennium is a period of time brother graham teaches it's a thousand years right it's a period of time so that time element continues to unfold so that time will continue that's what disturbs me sometimes when people get certain revelations especially like revelation 10 and the end of time and you got to know what you're talking about right see because if you if you try to make that the coming of the lord and the rapture that's not the ending of time right time continues on after the wedding supper after the uh armageddon after the millennium time continues on even to that point where it does eventually blend back into eternity again amen will we go into that new city the new city jerusalem the new jerusalem amen it all blends in together amen us and him perfect together again amen christ in mystery god revealed he said look god in his body christ in his body amen let's read that real quick colossians chapter 2. colossians chapter 2 verse 8. i've been meaning to read this and every time i get long and i'm not able to finish it colossians chapter 2 verse 8. praise the lord now colossians 1 19 says for it please the father that in him christ should all fullness dwell all a double l that's all inclusive that's everything nothing missing nothing left out complete amen all complete i've said many times whoever named that detergent all had a real revelation i mean that man should hopefully be a billionaire by now because that was smart to call his detergent all right which insinuates that everything that that larger detergent touches on your clothes is going to come clean right all right nothing left out all yeah so all it police the father in him all fullness dwell nothing left out all fullness now 2 8 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ now they they disguise it with in this in the disguise of christ they make it look like him reminds me of the story brother branham talked about when the back when he was alive when people come forth and they had these scars and they had blood coming out and all this and oil and stuff and they're like and come follow me i'm christ and come follow this and that and they have all these signs and stuff and people flock to it when he says that's not even scriptural right that's against the bible how can you be against the word and be and be the literal christ it doesn't work and but see that's that's how people do through philosophy or vein deceit now today it's just money that's that's what the whole world's motivated by money the love of money has absolutely eaten up this world yes this country and you hardly see anything done that people do today outside of god's people that's not done because of the love of money not for money there's nothing wrong with money it's the love of money that's the problem you fill this room with 100 bills it's not going to hurt a soul it's not going to bother one single person it could be 10 billion dollars in this room and not hurt a single person not cause a single problem not hurt anybody in any way but just let one person find out about it right just let one serpent see one human one person tell the next person all of a sudden it's on the news it's on the internet it's on social media it's everywhere you can find it people are killing each other to get their little portion of whatever money is in this room right that love is what destroys it yes yes but it's motivated obviously the end result is that love of money amen but it's out after the ruins of the world not after christ for in him in christ dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily oh we just read that amen accentuated the all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power you are complete well that's just the same thing he's saying over here about christ amen now obviously christ was in a different a position of sonship and and was and was perfect and sinless and we were born in sin shaped and equally come the world speaking lines but as far as the word goes god poured all he had all that fullness into one body jesus christ but when christ was crucified and his blood was shed and that spirit was released that spirit then came back and lit upon 120 people and now thousands sins thousands tens of thousands through the ages hundreds of thousands millions have tasted of that eternal gift that that that that is god's life god's spirit and that spirit that came is now complete in us once it was contained into one man jesus christ all the fullness of the godhead bodily but now brother graham said it's look god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride that bride she's gonna take on his image she's gonna take on his life just because she's become who he is you know the more time you spend together the more you begin to look like each other amen now sisters and especially my wife uh you're gonna hate to hear this but you're starting to look like us men more and more all the time it's a horrible thing to say i know because we're such ugly bugs sitting here but the truth of it is the more time you spend together the more you begin to start to look like each other that's just a fact the more time you spend with jesus christ the more in his image you're going to become yes the more his likeness you're going to become to where you hopefully we get to the place in this life the world we get so much like him that the world can't tell us apart now of course they're in such darkness they don't know one from the other you know you you you can the world is so dark you can flick a match and they'll think a spotlight is shining because it's so dark right but i want it to be that spotlight that that light of life that is shining forth through us through me that we let that work and the way to do that is to die die to ourselves yes paul said i die daily we should die daily every day amen he made the statement of course i died that he might live but then he said but i died daily it's not just the one time it's not just the new birth but it's a continual dying out to the lord jesus and to our own flesh so that he can have more preeminence in us through us that his life would do but we're complete now we're complete in him praise the lord christ in his body the bride all mine god made manifest in christ christ made manifest in the bride you believe your bride you say you're bright i believe i am i am amen i am i just say i'm not going to say i believe i am right i am a part of god's pride i am a part of that mystical body i am a part of that body that has brothers and sisters around the world i'm a part of that body i'm a part of that body that's gone on from the first church age when that 120 had received that spirit in the upper room a part of that body this went from that from the first church age and the first messenger paul all the way down to this day in this time that we live i'm a part of that yes amen i'm a part of that because it's part of me yeah christ manifested in his bride what does that manifest that's to take the cover off that's to make known to reveal reveal what bride well what is she she is him amen amen praise the lord she is him i heard a sad commentary the other day i won't say who said it but it was in the message and somebody said that's that that's like this world transgender stuff i said oh my what are we talking about with people the ungodly filth of the world like that has nothing to do with christ and his word amen but the bride is him she's becoming more like him all the time who is he he is the word yes amen he is the word manifested the cry christ made manifested in the bride and god took from the body of adam the woman she failed then god took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word that logos and it's bringing a bride out and you say you're part of that bride you say you're part of that bride i'm hoping you're at home saying you're part of that writer wherever you're streaming this his body which is his word and bringing a bride out that won't fall praise the lord won't fall by denomination or creed praise the lord this bride will not fail yes this bride cannot fail it is impossible for this bride now i'll say from the first church age until now we're a part of this last day brian cannot fail she cannot fall any more than he can fall because she's become him she's become the word that logos that intellectual property that god come and and place before the foundation world now but placed in the literal sense of each one of us in you before you were even born that seed come forth it brought life that seed of first john 3 came forth brought life and remains amen remains in you but now because of the birth it's not dormant it's brought life a seed can set dormant but when life hits that seed the seed is going to bring forth what what it is of what it's made of it's going to produce the light that's in it and when that light struck your path and that holy spirit came into you that seed brought forth life amen amen that life is the light of men that logos that intellectual property that part that was that who god is is now who you are we believe that it's who we are but lord help us help us that we died this thing this this this time element thing that we're trapped in amen no wonder brother abraham said i'm glad there's that open door called death amen but again though i'm not in a hurry to open that door but that this time body that we're trapped in god is give us another year saints yes what are we going to do with it right amen i'm going to close here i feel like this is at the end but this gods give us a new year you're alive we're here you're watching this you're sitting here standing here we got a new year what are we going to do with what is our plan buy a new car buy a new house which i probably shouldn't say because we are going to try to buy a house uh i'm not going to pay a king's ransom for one but uh we'd like me and my wife would like to buy a house this year buy a car buy a house have a bigger bank account live to see next year get healthier it's stronger i mean what do we plant what do we intend to do with this year people go through and into a new year and they have minds and hearts full of stuff right a lot of people will go and they'll tell you what their resolutions are as well usually a resolution is just a proclamation of failure usually i i've seen i've seen people when i was especially in business back east and people come in my office say i'm gonna i'm gonna lose a hundred pounds they come in my office beginning of the next year they're 50 pounds heavier i'm gonna uh i i'm gonna get uh a stronger i'm gonna get healthier or you know work out go to the gym that kind of thing you come back and you spend a thousand dollars on something that's rusting and rotting amen i'm gonna i'm gonna buy the latest state of art bicycling thing whatever they call them i'm gonna yeah and and then beginning of the next year it's on mccary or craigslist because it sat in the corner i had to clean it and dust it off just to get it on the resolutions forget them all right there's one thing i want to do that's put god first yes because if i put god first then he'll add all these other things to me right he'll add all these other things to our lives whatever it might be maybe it will be a new car maybe it will be a new house might not be a mansion might not be a mercedes but it'd be a car that you can drive a nice vehicle you can get around in or a nice house you can live in whatever it might be maybe you will have a little bit more money maybe you will be able to be able to provide more i just think i thank god me and brother roger talk about this all the time almost weekly he's 68 i'm 56 i've never done labor work like that i mostly enjoy it except when it's 100 degrees i like to go up in show law and work when it's june july and august but uh so it's not always easy but if you can just do something for god amen i i thank the lord and i'm just going to get personal as i close here but i thank god that he put it on brother roger's heart to ask me to help him because being able to make the finances with him is being able to help us provide for this place it's been able to help provide for me and my family i now this may sound crazy but i've seen one good thing to me one good thing come out of kobe it kicked us out of that place that i had gotten my little nest down in and was comfortable at it's cheap it's a nice place i was frustrated almost every sunday because people hanging out and talking in the sanctuary and going on and couldn't set up and do all these things it was frustrating a lot of times but it was easy it was comfortable amen and when that eagle god stirs that nest you know you sit down and he said time to get out time to go you know god creates circumstances to move us in directions that we need to go for him yes amen he'll create sometimes very uncomfortable circumstances to bring us to where we should be in him god help me i don't like those uncomfortable circumstances i don't want any more of them but you know how i can avoid them just obey him when he comes when he says when he talks to you just obey him right amen but at least it got us out of there and in here and i thank god gives me a brother to work with a fellowship with which i'm joy very much god is good amen and i appreciate it we don't have any great bank account we don't have any money we live we live day to day by the grace of god right uh we don't i mean god provides you have a nice card place to live we thank god for that but we don't have any uh you know but god takes care of us and that's that's the whole thing amen my son and my daughter are grown and they become self-sufficient and they serve the lord and they trust the lord and and and all and and i i'm assuming if time would continue to tarry they are of the assumption that uh mine their mother will not leave them a dime because there's probably not going to be a time to leave i don't know but it doesn't matter but god will provide right and that's what that that's what i look to that's what i trust the lord amen you know i'll say this as i close cause i just forgive me i'm just being personal reflecting a little bit i can talk to you because you're a captive audience and uh anyway but brother branham uh brother greene i think he may have said this behind the pulpit but i know he told me this personally brother branham had this standing understanding that if this certain bank account that they had got to a certain amount brother brown emptied it out he said don't this this account is not to get over a certain amount of money on ten thousand dollars or something not a great deal of money of course it may have been in the 60s but if it got to this brother green told me if that if this account got to this certain amount of money empty it out put it in the mission field do something for the lord with it don't let it sit there don't let it we're not worried about building kingdoms and accruing all this do something with it for the lord and that was his attitude that was his feeling about it get rid of it empty it out so he was telling me i think that because brother green had privy information to that account it was like two million dollars before brother green died but he's like brother green brother brown would have never agreed to that right because he said when he gets to this amount he said empty it put it in the mission field do something with it for the lord and i just think that's just like a good attitude right because god's going to take care of us isn't he yes he always has even in the darkest time even in some of the hardest times even in some of the roughest times even the times where it didn't seem like he had two nickels to rub god still took care of us we didn't go hungry amen had a place to live god provided amen and i believe he's going to do the same thing this year so what are we going to do with this year amen it's up to you as an individual but i'm going to do my best to grow closer to him amen let's stand if we could praise the lord saints he is our portion yes he is forgive amen i'm just trying to see maybe what the lord would want amen let's sing this course he put this on my heart yesterday so there's a reason for it number 316 in the song book uh we do have it on the oh we probably all

facebook and us as a family i know i went in to help her because she asked for my help to get a couple of things and i went back to my room and i felt the lord say why didn't you pray for her so i asked him do you want me to go back to pray for her he said no just about your head here so i bowed my head and asked god to go to that room and touch her amen four to five hours later she was up eating cooking amen the lord touched her yes amen you know her that's a miracle yeah because normally she'd be in bed all day all night yeah before any relief one time i two three days later had to take her to the hospital so amen god is good isn't he praise the lord the lord woke me up this morning to pray for brother charlie so god is mindful can't go to the hospitals now i like to go there
