[24:40] the lord took her
[24:42] that she had such an impact on the
[24:44] believer's lives

[35:54] 4.
[35:54] let's begin with ver chapter 4 verse 13.
[35:59] we know it probably some of us may be
[36:01] quoted by heart
[36:02] uh i actually was kind of torn back and
[36:05] forth of which
[36:07] subject or which scripture start with
[36:08] just so many you can but
[36:10] i i settled on this after study
[36:13] yesterday so
[36:14] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[36:15] brother concerning them which are asleep
[36:17] that you sorrow not even as others which
[36:19] have no hope
[36:21] for if we believe that jesus died and
[36:22] rose again even so them also which sleep
[36:25] in jesus will god bring with him
[36:27] for this we say unto you by the word of
[36:29] the lord that we which are alive and
[36:31] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[36:33] not prevent them which are asleep
[36:35] for the lord himself shall descend from
[36:37] heaven with a shout
[36:38] with the voice of the archangel and with
[36:40] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[36:42] shall rise first
[36:44] then we which are alive and remain shall
[36:46] be caught up together with uh
[36:47] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[36:49] in the air
[36:50] so shall we ever be with the lord
[36:53] wherefore
[36:54] comfort want to comfort one another with
[36:57] these words
[36:57] you can be seated if you like i mean as
[37:01] i said there's several scriptures that
[37:05] could have been read to begin beginning
[37:07] this thought but
[37:08] this is really probably the most
[37:11] renowned scripture that we look to when
[37:13] we talk about a rapture or a catching
[37:15] away
[37:16] and when it hit my heart it it it
[37:19] reached that place of
[37:21] of the word rapture or where we get
[37:23] rapture from
[37:24] and really where we get rapture from we
[37:26] know here is
[37:27] uh is in the 17th verse when it says
[37:31] that we
[37:31] those who live and remain shall be
[37:33] caught up together that caught up is
[37:35] what we talk about when we talk about
[37:37] being enraptured
[37:38] or a rapture that takes place or a
[37:41] reaching of a different dimension
[37:43] an elevation of of of persons as
[37:47] if you will to a higher dimension to a
[37:50] higher realm
[37:51] and being enraptured uh reaching that
[37:54] level being caught
[37:55] up and that's what the scripture
[37:56] referring to is is to be caught
[37:58] up amen so as we start this subject on
[38:02] the rapture again like i said
[38:04] there's probably going to be several
[38:06] parts to this
[38:07] because as i look into it of course
[38:11] you mull it through your mind all the
[38:12] time because it's just a subject that is
[38:14] always on a christian's heart
[38:16] it is a subject it's always or should be
[38:19] always on a christian's mind
[38:21] is the rapture you know brother greene
[38:24] always
[38:24] reminded us that brother branham said
[38:26] never lose your enthusiasm
[38:28] for the coming of the lord well that's
[38:29] the rapture that's the catching away
[38:32] and us as people as christians reaching
[38:35] that place so it's a very
[38:38] uh very much a paramount thought in our
[38:40] minds that we always
[38:41] keep there's always something that that
[38:43] that we think of maybe not every single
[38:45] day
[38:46] but almost every day at least probably
[38:48] every week at some point in time
[38:50] christians around the world think about
[38:52] or are consumed with
[38:54] the rapture what is it going to be like
[38:56] who's going to be in it
[38:58] when is it going to happen who all's
[39:00] going to know there's pictures drawn
[39:02] there's photo uh
[39:03] a paintings made of you know and movies
[39:06] made of a rapture taking place and
[39:09] planes crashing and cars crashing and
[39:11] people
[39:12] going up into the air and and all these
[39:14] people looking at them and all these
[39:16] things that are taking place
[39:17] but i want you know friend it's not
[39:19] going to be like that but not according
[39:21] to the scripture
[39:22] right i'm not sure exactly what that
[39:24] what that pain
[39:25] beautiful pain uh very good artistry
[39:27] work but it's very unscriptural
[39:29] because if you look at the scripture
[39:30] it's not at all going to be like that
[39:32] uh we know that the the the rapture is
[39:35] going to be a secret
[39:36] catching away it's going to be like a
[39:38] thief in the night right it's going to
[39:40] be something that's going to happen and
[39:41] the world's not really even going to
[39:43] know about it right there's going to be
[39:44] probably a few select people there's
[39:46] going to be
[39:47] a a small amount of people around the
[39:50] world that are going to know
[39:51] right they're going to know that it's
[39:52] happening and maybe they start crying
[39:54] out about it maybe they start
[39:56] saying something about it and of course
[39:57] those people may very well and the
[39:59] tribulation end up in a
[40:01] a in a a rubber room i guess i don't
[40:04] know what better terminology to put it
[40:06] people think they've gone insane the
[40:08] rapture has already taken place
[40:10] uh uh they've gone they've gone crazy
[40:12] you know
[40:13] last last week uh you heard the subject
[40:16] about the misunderstanding that i talked
[40:18] about and
[40:18] uh kind of felt that like this goes
[40:20] right along with it a little bit because
[40:22] of
[40:22] the things that are misunderstood in
[40:24] here and i was reading uh some of the
[40:26] notes that scofield out of my study
[40:28] scofield bible
[40:29] had in here and i didn't realize how far
[40:32] off scofield was
[40:33] on on something as paramount and is as
[40:36] fundamental as
[40:37] as the rapture i look at some of his
[40:40] notes and i'm like my that is wrong and
[40:41] i look at this
[40:42] it goes over this note and i said man
[40:45] he's wrong there and
[40:46] i thank god for a prophet to come and
[40:48] help us to bring that scripture to tie
[40:50] all those things together and
[40:52] show us that this goes with this this
[40:54] goes with this
[40:55] this is out here and this doesn't happen
[40:56] until over here and
[40:58] uh and all those things but uh after
[41:01] service last week brother pat
[41:02] came up to me and uh said something that
[41:05] i had
[41:05] i had forgotten about that would have
[41:07] went really well with uh
[41:08] with with the uh uh uh with the subject
[41:11] that we were on last sunday because
[41:13] uh he as brother pat's given his
[41:15] testimony in church before
[41:17] how many of you were there it's been
[41:18] many years ago but uh
[41:20] about him going in the military and his
[41:24] private interview with brother branham
[41:26] and uh wanting to get out of the
[41:28] military and not
[41:29] have to be drafted and all and and you
[41:32] know brother brown says i i don't have a
[41:34] word of the lord for you but
[41:35] uh maybe the lord's got to work for you
[41:37] to do and of course brother pat
[41:39] as his testimony he had a work of the
[41:42] lord and
[41:42] uh he fulfilled we believe in retrospect
[41:45] and
[41:46] fulfilled that work of the lord and met
[41:47] the man that he led to the lord and
[41:49] uh told him about the prophet and the
[41:51] message and all and
[41:52] and brother pat had a radio he was
[41:54] listening and of course i'm condensing
[41:56] the story way down
[41:57] and he heard that there was a rapture
[41:59] taking place and they were all gathering
[42:01] in jeffersonville
[42:02] because the rapture was going on and
[42:03] brother pat got so excited
[42:05] he went out of his tenors uh wherever he
[42:08] was sleeping
[42:09] telling everybody the rapture was on the
[42:10] rapture was on the rapture was on well
[42:12] obviously that was a misunderstanding
[42:14] the rapture wasn't actually as we would
[42:17] say catching away at that moment in time
[42:19] although the rapture's been on uh
[42:22] basically since the
[42:23] death of christ since pentecost it's
[42:25] been on yes uh
[42:26] but uh to the point that we're all a
[42:30] body changing and enraptured that's a
[42:32] different story so it's a little
[42:34] misunderstanding but
[42:35] because of that uh brother uh pat going
[42:39] around and telling
[42:40] uh the all the ones around him and his
[42:42] sergeant and everybody the rapture is on
[42:44] the rapture zone that's happening in
[42:45] jefferson
[42:46] after islam they thought he was crazy so
[42:48] they sent him home
[42:50] because of misunderstanding they thought
[42:52] well this he's just lost his marbles
[42:54] he's
[42:55] and they sit and that's how he got to
[42:56] come home they thought he was crazy just
[42:58] because of
[42:59] the this news report that the rapture
[43:02] was on
[43:03] the misunderstanding that's there of the
[43:05] rapture taking place at that moment in
[43:07] time
[43:08] but the the fact of it is that uh
[43:11] there's going to be people that are
[43:13] going to know about it but it's going to
[43:14] be a secret catching away
[43:16] it's not going to be something that
[43:18] everybody's going to know about it's not
[43:19] going to be broadcast worldwide
[43:21] although it's going to be an
[43:22] international rapture right i think the
[43:24] alive and remain group
[43:26] is going to be a small enough group that
[43:28] there's so many people that disappear
[43:30] off this earth every day that nobody
[43:31] knows anything about and know
[43:33] know where they go and what happens to
[43:35] them then that uh
[43:36] that that's just gonna happen if people
[43:38] are just to say well they just
[43:40] disappear because of so and so and such
[43:42] and such and and life is just going to
[43:44] go on like normal
[43:45] churches are going to keep having church
[43:47] and preachers are going to keep
[43:48] preaching
[43:48] people going to keep coming to the altar
[43:50] they're going to keep having
[43:51] celebrations and worship and
[43:52] everything else going on just like it
[43:54] was going on before
[43:56] unlike the movie left behind it won't be
[43:58] like that
[43:59] right they're all in despair we miss the
[44:01] rapture and then they got even gonna
[44:02] know
[44:03] right they're not gonna know because
[44:04] it's gonna be a secret calling away
[44:07] it's not going to be to the to the
[44:08] multitudes it's not going to be to the
[44:10] huge conglomerations the denominations
[44:14] it's for a little elected lady that god
[44:16] calls and we chose to
[44:18] by the scripture call ourselves the
[44:19] bride amen that is the bride that god is
[44:22] calling to take her home to be with him
[44:23] one day
[44:24] and and that rapture is for that gentile
[44:27] bride
[44:28] yes that's what the rapture is for it is
[44:30] not for the old testament saints
[44:32] we know that's already taken place it's
[44:34] not for the jews
[44:36] it's for god's gentile bride of this new
[44:39] testament
[44:40] from the day of pentecost on through
[44:42] every church age it's not going to be
[44:44] just for the alive and remain it's going
[44:46] to be for those that
[44:47] have fallen asleep in christ from the
[44:49] very first church age from
[44:51] peter and paul and all those disciples
[44:53] there up until this moment
[44:55] and however long the lord may tarry it's
[44:58] going to be all of those
[44:59] that are alive and remain they're going
[45:00] to come up together and we're all going
[45:02] to be uh uh
[45:04] uh together here brother adam said 30
[45:06] minimum 30 days
[45:08] and we're all going to go home to meet
[45:10] the lord in the air now
[45:12] the rapture in the rapture message
[45:16] because the rapture itself the rapture
[45:18] is a revelation
[45:20] now if the rapture is a revelation that
[45:22] it that excludes those that
[45:25] don't believe in revelation if a person
[45:28] a christian
[45:28] say well how can a christian not believe
[45:30] in revelation it's all through the bible
[45:32] good question i don't really know how
[45:34] they could but they did brother
[45:35] branham's time they do today
[45:37] they still deny the fact that there's
[45:39] revelation
[45:40] but god reveals to those to whom he will
[45:43] and he reveals to whom he will
[45:45] what he wants them to know yes now we
[45:47] may not all know
[45:48] everything all at the same time but
[45:51] we'll know what the lord that we need to
[45:52] know of the word
[45:54] and reveal to us to be able to change
[45:56] our mortal bodies into
[45:58] incorruption into immortality so that
[46:01] this body will change to go meet the
[46:03] lord in the air
[46:04] yes to a glorious body so
[46:07] that rapture being a revelation
[46:11] brings the understanding that this that
[46:13] it's a rapturing
[46:14] faith amen a faith a faith that brings
[46:18] about rapture
[46:19] a faith that brings about a body change
[46:21] and and that's kind of going to be the
[46:23] part of it that i want to talk about
[46:24] today
[46:25] now look at this quote but in the
[46:27] rapture message now you know brother
[46:29] bradham he
[46:30] just one little bank within yuma uh he
[46:33] preached the
[46:34] rapture message he was talking about
[46:36] only being 30 minutes i think it ended
[46:37] up being an hour that was trying to run
[46:39] him out and
[46:40] uh he kept saying over and over and he
[46:42] said okay we gotta hurry now and
[46:44] uh and rush through the last part of it
[46:47] but it ended up being a while
[46:48] so much so brother branham says i heard
[46:50] they took up an offer i want to take
[46:52] that offer and pay for the extended time
[46:53] of the use of the room
[46:55] see so uh but it's just this one message
[46:58] but in the rapture message brother madam
[47:00] makes this
[47:00] uh several of course quotes about the
[47:03] rapture but this one says but to the
[47:04] bride
[47:05] listen now to the bride the rapture is a
[47:08] revelation to her
[47:10] it is a revelation to her what is a
[47:12] revelation revelations faith
[47:14] remember we talked about a revelation uh
[47:18] to me a revelation is something that god
[47:20] reveals to you
[47:22] that becomes a part of who you are yes
[47:24] okay
[47:25] it becomes a part of who your your being
[47:28] your the way you live and who you are it
[47:31] just becomes a part of you just as much
[47:33] as you are
[47:33] a human being you live the life of a
[47:36] human being because you're a human being
[47:38] it's revealed to you that you're a human
[47:40] being you know you're a human
[47:42] and no nobody can come along and try to
[47:44] convince you that you're a gorilla
[47:46] nobody can come by and try to convince
[47:48] you that you're an elephant
[47:49] because you know you're not you're not a
[47:51] whale you're not a chimpanzee
[47:54] you're you're not a koala you're a human
[47:56] and nobody convinced you
[47:58] right nobody can convince you any
[48:00] different at all the revelation is the
[48:01] same thing
[48:02] it just becomes a part of who you are
[48:04] when god reveals
[48:06] something to you it drops down in your
[48:08] heart and it settles in there
[48:10] to the truth of what the word is and
[48:13] nobody else
[48:14] nobody can reason away then the
[48:16] scripture becomes enlightened to you
[48:18] the word becomes enlightened at that
[48:20] point the word is not just word anymore
[48:24] it's not just script on a page it
[48:26] becomes a living oracle it becomes a
[48:29] living
[48:29] word it becomes a living being because
[48:32] the word is christ
[48:34] and it becomes alive to you and and when
[48:37] it's alive to you
[48:38] then you take the other scripture and it
[48:40] ties itself
[48:41] in and it fits in so perfectly to say
[48:43] how could i
[48:44] miss that before because you didn't have
[48:46] the revelation of it amen
[48:48] and you didn't have the revelation
[48:50] because people try to intake
[48:52] intellectually tie the scripture
[48:53] together like again i said about
[48:55] scuffled notes
[48:57] he tried to intellectually uh uh bring
[49:00] these scriptures in together to try to
[49:02] make them tie together to try to make
[49:03] them make
[49:04] sense saints the bible isn't here to be
[49:08] sensible to you it is here for you to
[49:11] gain revelation of regardless of whether
[49:14] you
[49:14] understand it or not you don't have to
[49:17] understand something with your mental
[49:20] faculties for god to reveal it to you
[49:22] for you to understand
[49:24] in your spirit what it is by revelation
[49:27] you know there's going to be a rapture
[49:29] because it's revealed to you there's
[49:31] going to be a rapture amen
[49:32] not just because the bible says so even
[49:36] but because god's revealed that bible to
[49:38] you
[49:40] i i told you before i have taken a
[49:42] little issue now
[49:44] this is just my it's i'm not saying it
[49:47] should be changed
[49:49] so don't get me wrong i'm not arguing
[49:52] against it
[49:53] but i have a little disagreement with
[49:56] the
[49:57] seven seal book the seven seal book says
[50:01] the revelation of the seven seals
[50:04] but friend it's not the revelation of
[50:07] anything
[50:08] right it's the understanding
[50:11] is the truth of only god can bring
[50:15] revelation
[50:16] brother branham could not bring
[50:18] revelation
[50:20] he can preach the revelation that god
[50:22] give him of something
[50:24] but that doesn't reveal it to you
[50:27] it just becomes knowledge to you at that
[50:29] point
[50:30] right that's all it is it's just
[50:32] knowledge
[50:33] if they want to put the truth of the
[50:35] seven seals
[50:37] okay but it's not revealed until
[50:40] god reveals it to you and when god
[50:43] reveals it to you
[50:44] then it all fits perfectly and you think
[50:47] my i always wondered where that
[50:49] scripture would fit in
[50:50] and now because of god revealing
[50:53] something and it could have been
[50:54] something over here
[50:55] not even that scripture but that
[50:57] scripture comes in places in there and
[50:59] then maybe that scripture comes
[51:00] because it's a revelation right the
[51:02] rapture is the same way friend the
[51:05] rapture is a revelation
[51:07] it is something that is revealed to you
[51:09] it is something that you
[51:11] know is going to happen because it's
[51:13] ingrained in your spirit
[51:14] and nobody can take it away from you
[51:17] it's a revelation because
[51:19] faith is a revelation if faith is a
[51:22] revelation it's revealed to you that
[51:24] by faith you believe it amen now without
[51:28] faith you can't believe that something
[51:30] exists right
[51:31] if you can't see it faith is the
[51:33] substance of things hoped for
[51:35] the evidence of things what no not not
[51:37] seen
[51:38] right so if it's not seen then you have
[51:41] to have
[51:42] faith to believe that it exists if you
[51:45] cannot come through that door today
[51:47] and show me a living embodiment
[51:50] god almighty standing before you how are
[51:53] you going to prove to somebody he exists
[51:55] right right it's got to be by faith
[51:58] you've got to receive it by faith and
[52:00] faith is a revelation
[52:01] how did abel know to offer to god a more
[52:03] excellent sacrifice than what cain's
[52:05] sacrifice was
[52:06] because it was revealed to him it wasn't
[52:10] just
[52:10] knowledge it was revealed to him what
[52:13] was pleasing to the lord
[52:15] and by faith amen by faith he offered to
[52:19] god a more excellent sacrifice
[52:21] what was that faith that faith was a
[52:23] revelation
[52:25] i am sure because you know sometimes we
[52:29] super spiritualize everything
[52:31] especially being in the message you know
[52:33] we have to super spiritualize everything
[52:35] but not everything is super
[52:37] spiritualized in fact
[52:39] a very small fraction of things really
[52:42] are super spiritualized
[52:44] the rest of is just god working in
[52:46] humans right
[52:47] it's just god doing his work through me
[52:49] and you god doing his work through
[52:51] brother brown god doing his work
[52:52] through men and women today through holy
[52:54] ghost-filled christians today it's just
[52:56] god working through us
[52:58] i think it's this exact same thing in
[52:59] the garden of eden i think that adam
[53:02] adam was talking to cain and abel and
[53:04] and i believe
[53:05] and i believe adam relayed the whole
[53:07] story of what happened and
[53:09] and it thinks the garden of eden and the
[53:10] fallen i think both boys were privy to
[53:13] the information
[53:14] that adam gave to him but to one boy it
[53:17] was just knowledge
[53:18] but to the other boy it was a revelation
[53:21] to abel it was a revelation it was
[53:24] revealed to abel by
[53:26] faith that what god had done in the
[53:28] garden of eden was what was pleasing to
[53:30] the lord
[53:31] that it took blood it took a blood
[53:34] sacrifice to please the lord
[53:36] oh well cain heard the uh this is just
[53:39] me
[53:39] this is not in the scripture but if i
[53:42] envision it and i see what happened in
[53:44] the garden of eden
[53:45] i could see adam walking with cain and
[53:47] abel
[53:49] i will just say for sake of argument his
[53:52] sons
[53:53] walking in the garden of eden now we
[53:55] know cain was of the wicked one it
[53:56] wasn't adam's seed
[53:58] but for lack of conversation
[54:01] there he's walking and talking to them
[54:04] and telling them
[54:05] just like a father with his sons
[54:07] teaching his sons
[54:08] raising them this is this this is this
[54:11] this is the story of this and this is
[54:12] what happened here and this is
[54:14] what happened to me and your mother and
[54:16] all you know how dad will do his kids
[54:18] that's all it is we can't you make
[54:20] everything so super spiritualized friend
[54:23] it's just a dad talking to his sons
[54:26] talking to the boys that are there that
[54:27] he's raising
[54:30] but to what it became knowledge it
[54:33] didn't mean anything to cain
[54:34] right he listened to the same story that
[54:37] abel listened to
[54:38] but he didn't have it he didn't have
[54:40] what he needed to gain the revelation of
[54:42] what the story meant
[54:44] what the what the behind the story was
[54:47] by revelation then abel was able to all
[54:50] front unto god a more excellent
[54:52] sacrifice by faith
[54:54] because to abel it was more than just a
[54:57] story
[54:58] to able it was more than just what
[55:00] happened to the garden of eden or just
[55:01] what happened to his
[55:02] mom and dad it was more than that right
[55:05] it was a revelation of whom the man
[55:07] the the deity that he was trying to
[55:10] please and live for
[55:11] it meant more to him to be able to
[55:13] please that deity
[55:15] and what it took to please him than just
[55:18] a story
[55:19] it was a revelation and when that
[55:21] revelation come
[55:22] time to be able to offer up a sacrifice
[55:25] to that god they were worshiping
[55:27] he knew it took more than just
[55:30] fruits and vegetables and body life
[55:33] right it took
[55:34] blood very much god himself
[55:38] signified by the slaying of those lambs
[55:41] that it was going to take
[55:43] blood to bring them back blood
[55:46] to please the lord innocent blood
[55:50] and abel knew that how did he know that
[55:52] he knew that by revelation
[55:54] by faith become revealed to him was
[55:57] revealed to him
[55:58] that it meant more to him than just a
[55:59] story
[56:01] hey this is what happened well
[56:04] cages well that's just a story that's a
[56:06] nice story pop appreciate that and let
[56:08] me just offer my sacrifice over here my
[56:11] peaches and apricots and apples and
[56:13] everything and surely the lord will
[56:15] accept that no
[56:16] no he won't because that sacrifice is
[56:19] without revelation
[56:20] right it's without spiritual truth to it
[56:24] amen that revelation now that that
[56:27] revelation
[56:28] by faith is a revelation it's what the
[56:31] rapture is
[56:32] to god's people to god's children to
[56:35] some
[56:35] it's a story in the bible to some it's
[56:38] fiction
[56:39] to some they don't even believe it to
[56:41] some it's just fiction
[56:43] to some it's a story in the bible to
[56:45] some they believe it's
[56:46] a million miles down the road never
[56:48] happened in our lifetime to some
[56:50] it is the most precious thing that we
[56:52] look to in the scripture
[56:54] of god's promise to his children of
[56:56] where he's going to take them
[56:58] yes amen that's why paul says to the
[57:01] thessalonian church
[57:02] as those that have no hope i don't want
[57:05] you to sorrow
[57:06] yes it's okay to grieve it's okay to be
[57:09] sorrowful to miss your loved ones
[57:11] but don't grieve as those that have no
[57:13] hope don't grieve as though you'll never
[57:16] see them again
[57:17] see as those that have no hope because
[57:20] there's people there
[57:21] and there's people today that have no
[57:24] hope
[57:25] because they have put their hope and
[57:27] trust in something else
[57:29] right they put their hope and trust in a
[57:31] government
[57:32] or in a money or in or in possessions
[57:35] or in medicine or in insurance they put
[57:38] their hope and trust in everything but
[57:40] god
[57:41] right and you put your hope in
[57:42] everything else you've got no hope
[57:45] right they have no hope they have no
[57:47] hope today
[57:48] there's people that think they have hope
[57:51] but they don't have hope
[57:52] because they haven't placed this word by
[57:54] revelation in their heart
[57:56] amen what did david say i'll take this
[57:58] and place it in my heart lord
[57:59] so i will not sin against you what is
[58:02] that that's a revelation amen
[58:05] that's that's david taking god's word
[58:07] into himself
[58:09] so that he won't sin against him what i
[58:12] plan to do and trust in my life
[58:14] my desire is to do everything i can do
[58:16] to be pleasing to you lord
[58:18] and that's all that's a christian that's
[58:20] our mantra
[58:22] that is our mantra to that that is our
[58:24] motive that's what we all should aspire
[58:26] to do in our lives
[58:27] lord what is it that's going to be
[58:28] pleasing to you help me to do that
[58:31] that's a revelation that's something
[58:34] that is revealed to you that is a dying
[58:36] of yourself so that christ can live in
[58:39] you
[58:39] through you and by him then in you
[58:43] a victorious life amen praise not
[58:46] without
[58:47] bumps and haunts and dips but it's a
[58:49] victorious life
[58:50] amen amen what did brother branham talk
[58:53] about a brother green all
[58:55] all those times brother branham told him
[58:56] about him billy paul all his great
[58:58] buddies here you'll be
[58:59] great buddies on the other side and all
[59:01] this stuff in the middle what does it
[59:02] matter
[59:03] yeah yeah amen what does this matter
[59:06] what does this amount to yes got bumps
[59:09] and humps lots and dips and
[59:11] all these rough places and hard places
[59:14] but you know in the end that's what
[59:15] god's looking for the result
[59:17] yeah the end result yes lord bring it as
[59:20] a revelation to our hearts
[59:22] bring it as a revelation when i read his
[59:24] bible every time i
[59:26] i try to remember every time lord just
[59:28] reveal to me
[59:30] and hear what you want me to know amen
[59:33] god will reveal it to you so the rebel
[59:35] the rapture
[59:36] is a revelation it's a revelation
[59:40] you think well that's just simple it
[59:42] really isn't because it's not for
[59:43] everybody
[59:44] nor is the revelation or the rapture is
[59:47] not for everybody
[59:49] but to the bride the rapture is a
[59:51] revelation to her
[59:53] it's revealed to her that the revelation
[59:56] the true
[59:57] bride of christ will be waiting for that
[59:59] revelation
[1:00:00] of the rapture now it is a revelation
[1:00:03] for the revelation
[1:00:04] is faith like we just talked about the
[1:00:07] revelation
[1:00:08] is faith you cannot have a revelation
[1:00:11] without it being faith because when
[1:00:14] something's revealed to you
[1:00:16] it doesn't have to be tangible it
[1:00:18] doesn't have to be something you can see
[1:00:20] tasteful smell or hear
[1:00:22] it it doesn't have to be something you
[1:00:24] can imagine a reason in your mind
[1:00:27] but you know it is because it's a
[1:00:29] revelation
[1:00:30] well how do you how is it revealed how
[1:00:32] do you believe it
[1:00:33] you got to have faith you got to have
[1:00:35] faith
[1:00:36] the only way to please the lord is how
[1:00:39] by faith
[1:00:40] you got to have faith is a revelation
[1:00:42] you cannot you cannot have a revelation
[1:00:45] without it being faith faith is a
[1:00:47] revelation because it's something
[1:00:49] that is revealed to you and it's
[1:00:52] revealed to you
[1:00:53] that's it amen somebody gives you a
[1:00:56] little bit of knowledge from the
[1:00:57] scripture you say oh i see that
[1:00:58] jesus said father son the holy ghost so
[1:01:01] hey let's baptize and follow us on the
[1:01:03] holy ghost
[1:01:03] after all is what jesus said
[1:01:07] that's a great argument but if you take
[1:01:10] the revelation of the word and you bring
[1:01:12] it down to what the
[1:01:13] what what the truth of it is and you see
[1:01:16] peter uh who had just come out from the
[1:01:19] holy spirit and
[1:01:21] in the upper room said the name of the
[1:01:23] lord jesus christ
[1:01:25] all that then you think well then why
[1:01:27] did jesus say this over here well if you
[1:01:29] have a revelation of what peter said in
[1:01:31] acts 2 38
[1:01:32] what jesus said in in matthew 28 becomes
[1:01:35] alive
[1:01:36] amen you think i praise the lord they're
[1:01:38] just saying the same thing
[1:01:40] right amen amen it is simple because
[1:01:43] it's revealed
[1:01:44] but you believe it by faith amen i think
[1:01:47] god danny got that revelation
[1:01:49] amen he got his break he got his anklet
[1:01:51] off last sunday
[1:01:53] and he didn't want to waste past one
[1:01:55] saturday
[1:01:56] and he got a text said let's do it this
[1:01:59] saturday i said praise the lord let's do
[1:02:01] it
[1:02:01] amen amen so by the grace of god me and
[1:02:04] brother dennis were able to take and
[1:02:05] baptize brother danny in the name of the
[1:02:07] lord jesus christ you've been waiting
[1:02:08] for it
[1:02:09] amen and thankful because it became a
[1:02:12] revelation amen yeah
[1:02:13] because it was a revelation i've been in
[1:02:16] i've been in places where
[1:02:17] uh we're a great move of the spirit's
[1:02:19] going and it's wonderful and the spirit
[1:02:21] is falling and
[1:02:22] people are getting emotional and happy
[1:02:24] and they come to the altar and all and
[1:02:26] they go on they want to get baptized and
[1:02:28] another one sees somebody get baptized
[1:02:29] and inspires them to get baptized
[1:02:31] and then on and on and next thing you
[1:02:33] know 20 30 people been baptized
[1:02:36] well did they get baptized because it
[1:02:38] was revealed to them that they should
[1:02:39] get baptized by the word
[1:02:41] or were they just caught up in the
[1:02:42] emotion as they see somebody else
[1:02:44] getting baptized right
[1:02:45] i've seen people do that and next thing
[1:02:47] you know they're out back in the world
[1:02:49] right just doing whatever living however
[1:02:51] it wasn't a revelation to them
[1:02:53] they got caught up in the emotion or the
[1:02:54] feeling of it and what was going on and
[1:02:57] or wanted to be a part of the group or
[1:02:58] something and and they go and get
[1:03:00] baptized but it
[1:03:01] didn't mean anything because it was
[1:03:03] first of all probably there's no
[1:03:05] repentance
[1:03:05] it's got to be a true repentance a turn
[1:03:08] for that revelation to take effect now
[1:03:11] faith is a revelation
[1:03:12] because it's something that's revealed
[1:03:13] to you faith is a revelation is
[1:03:15] something
[1:03:16] that has been revealed like it was to
[1:03:18] abraham that could call anything
[1:03:20] contrary that what uh to what had been
[1:03:23] revealed to him
[1:03:24] as though it wasn't so now faith
[1:03:27] that's what faith is is the revelation
[1:03:30] of
[1:03:30] god the church is built upon a
[1:03:34] revelation the whole entire
[1:03:37] body is built upon that revelation
[1:03:40] that revelation of who god is now that
[1:03:43] revelation
[1:03:45] has got to bring a rapturing faith to a
[1:03:48] group of people
[1:03:49] those that have gone on and who
[1:03:51] resurrect first the dead those who have
[1:03:53] fallen asleep in christ
[1:03:55] they did so at that position of their
[1:03:57] life
[1:03:58] if they're going to be there when they
[1:04:00] passed
[1:04:01] they were in that position they were in
[1:04:03] that place
[1:04:04] of when they resurrected they were going
[1:04:07] to go to meet the lord
[1:04:08] they would be in the first resurrection
[1:04:10] see when they died they died in that
[1:04:12] place
[1:04:14] when this alive and remain group get to
[1:04:16] that place
[1:04:17] when she's alive in her name to to get
[1:04:20] to that place of rapturing faith to
[1:04:22] where she doesn't taste
[1:04:24] death then it's revealed to her
[1:04:27] that in any moment in time that this is
[1:04:29] going to begin to take place in our
[1:04:31] lives
[1:04:32] that a rapturing faith has got to come
[1:04:34] and
[1:04:35] and and instill its its position in your
[1:04:38] heart
[1:04:39] now we've talked about
[1:04:43] rapturing faith before we've talked
[1:04:45] about faith and
[1:04:46] and of course to me a perfect faith that
[1:04:49] brother branham preached
[1:04:51] is a rapturing faith because you can't
[1:04:53] get any better than a
[1:04:54] faith that has absolutely no failures or
[1:04:57] faults in it
[1:04:58] because that's what perfect is perfect
[1:05:00] faith is something that has no faults no
[1:05:02] mistakes it's
[1:05:03] it's the epitome of what it's supposed
[1:05:05] to be that would bring
[1:05:06] that would be a rapturing faith right
[1:05:10] now rapturing faith has got to be
[1:05:12] coupled with
[1:05:14] the timing the placement of
[1:05:17] god's perfect will for this event to
[1:05:20] take place amen
[1:05:22] now that that's not to say
[1:05:25] see look now that that the bride
[1:05:29] or that portions of it don't at this
[1:05:32] moment have rapturing faith
[1:05:35] you may have you may have reached a
[1:05:37] place in your life of or we'll just call
[1:05:39] it perfect faith
[1:05:42] i don't see too many people agreeing
[1:05:44] amen i feel the same way
[1:05:46] trust me uh i think when that perfect
[1:05:49] faith hits i won't be here anymore
[1:05:51] but there may be that place where you
[1:05:53] you you've received that kind of faith
[1:05:55] because look faith comes by hearing and
[1:05:57] hearing the word of god
[1:05:59] amen does it not right faith comes by
[1:06:01] hearing and hearing the word of god uh
[1:06:04] isaiah isaiah 55 says
[1:06:08] uh let's start with the sixth verse do
[1:06:10] you want to turn there go ahead
[1:06:12] i don't want to rush like i said it's
[1:06:15] going to be several parts to this so
[1:06:21] isaiah chapter 55 verse 6
[1:06:25] because again mass
[1:06:28] man please say this again we so many
[1:06:31] times
[1:06:33] and please don't get it fixed in your
[1:06:35] mind saints that that everything is just
[1:06:38] super spiritualized everything has to be
[1:06:41] a super spiritual uh supernatural event
[1:06:45] of some kind
[1:06:46] all of it we know supernatural i mean
[1:06:48] because god is supernatural
[1:06:50] but most of the time it's just common
[1:06:54] elements of common things that just
[1:06:56] happen
[1:06:56] in our daily lives right right it's not
[1:06:59] something that's
[1:07:03] we get this superhero mentality can i
[1:07:06] say it that way
[1:07:07] yeah you just think that you're gonna
[1:07:10] ascend up onto the
[1:07:12] on the top of mount limit with some cape
[1:07:14] or something i got perfect faith
[1:07:17] i'm super spiritual and
[1:07:20] and some proclamation or exclamation
[1:07:23] when jesus was born
[1:07:26] did was there any proclamation on the
[1:07:29] mountains or any
[1:07:30] was there any bells whistles fireworks
[1:07:33] was it
[1:07:34] just a simple humble woman a simple
[1:07:38] humble man
[1:07:38] yes in a manger in in
[1:07:42] on a manure pile our savior was born
[1:07:45] yes no fanfare no capes no superhero
[1:07:50] supernatural spiritual i'm here to come
[1:07:53] to the world
[1:07:54] now jesus didn't come like that simple
[1:07:57] thinking if there's ever going to be a
[1:07:59] super spiritually then
[1:08:01] it's going to be the birth of jesus well
[1:08:03] that's exactly how they missed him
[1:08:06] right because that's what they had
[1:08:08] configured in their minds
[1:08:10] that this was going to happen when our
[1:08:11] messiah comes he's going to descend on
[1:08:14] the mount of olives with a
[1:08:15] tape and a robe and he's going to wipe
[1:08:18] them all away
[1:08:18] it wasn't that wasn't the bible the
[1:08:21] torah first of all
[1:08:24] but that's how they missed it they were
[1:08:25] blinded remember when we talked about
[1:08:27] them being blinded
[1:08:28] in the free will service the free will
[1:08:30] they were blinded
[1:08:31] how are they blinded because they had
[1:08:33] already had all this other stuff fixed
[1:08:35] in their minds
[1:08:36] it's going to be like this it's going to
[1:08:38] be like this god's going to do this
[1:08:39] it's going to be some great supers and
[1:08:41] then they missed the whole thing
[1:08:44] they absolutely were blinded and missed
[1:08:48] the entire
[1:08:50] event of their messiah coming and so
[1:08:53] many times we do the exact same thing
[1:08:56] yes we have it so fixed in our minds if
[1:08:59] god's going to do it like this and do it
[1:09:01] like this it's going to happen like this
[1:09:02] it's going to be all this great pop and
[1:09:04] circumstances all these
[1:09:06] things his bells and whistles and
[1:09:07] fireworks and everything and
[1:09:09] god's going to descend down on cattle in
[1:09:11] the mountains and
[1:09:12] a robe and and take it all over and see
[1:09:15] it's
[1:09:16] we get it so super spiritualized we miss
[1:09:19] how
[1:09:20] easily how commonly how
[1:09:23] perfectly and shall i say even mundane
[1:09:27] that god actually works most of the time
[1:09:31] that's how god actually works most of
[1:09:33] the time
[1:09:34] right it's just in the simplicity of it
[1:09:37] and that's what he's doing here that's
[1:09:40] that's what i want to help us to see
[1:09:42] friend you think oh well what
[1:09:45] it is like going to the fair and hitting
[1:09:47] that bell and
[1:09:48] yeah you hit the bell bing i hit it down
[1:09:51] that's
[1:09:51] i made it it doesn't work that way
[1:09:55] that's not how the supernatural the
[1:09:57] spiritual element works in our lives it
[1:09:59] doesn't work like that
[1:10:01] right that's why we're sitting here
[1:10:02] thinking oh brother you says there's
[1:10:04] people it's probably god might have
[1:10:05] perfect faith
[1:10:07] you might oh you i might you don't know
[1:10:11] it
[1:10:11] you might not know it but look friend
[1:10:13] faith comes by
[1:10:14] hearing the word amen well let me ask
[1:10:17] you a question
[1:10:18] do you listen to the word do you read
[1:10:21] the word
[1:10:22] right now do you listen to the word of
[1:10:23] the hour i'm not talking about a hybrid
[1:10:26] word
[1:10:27] it can't be something from uh some
[1:10:30] hibernation or some man's
[1:10:32] opinion or idea of the word but a purity
[1:10:35] of the holiness of god's
[1:10:37] unadulterated word because that's the
[1:10:39] only thing that will bring it
[1:10:40] yes and the only thing that will bring
[1:10:42] it so that's i'm only talking about that
[1:10:46] well when it's that then you can know
[1:10:50] right and this is the that faith comes
[1:10:52] by hearing
[1:10:53] so if you're hearing the word if the
[1:10:56] word is being ministered to your heart
[1:10:58] if you're reading it if you're listening
[1:11:00] to tapes or you're coming to church
[1:11:02] and you're listening to the word and the
[1:11:05] word is feeding you
[1:11:07] then look friend it's going to do what
[1:11:09] god
[1:11:10] said it will do whether you realize it's
[1:11:13] going on
[1:11:14] inside you or not it is there amen
[1:11:17] look what jesus look what isaiah says 55
[1:11:20] and 6
[1:11:22] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[1:11:26] call ye upon him while he is near let
[1:11:28] the wicked forsake his way in the
[1:11:30] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:11:33] return
[1:11:33] unto the lord and he will have mercy
[1:11:35] upon him
[1:11:36] and to our god for he will abundantly
[1:11:39] part
[1:11:40] praise the lord for my thoughts are not
[1:11:43] your thoughts
[1:11:44] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:11:47] lord
[1:11:48] thank god for that amen praise the lord
[1:11:52] amen that's the truth amen
[1:11:57] so what does that mean well first of all
[1:12:00] that means that your carnal thoughts are
[1:12:01] going to be
[1:12:02] so far removed from what the truth
[1:12:04] really is
[1:12:06] that your way of it and your imagination
[1:12:09] and conjuring of it
[1:12:10] in your own imagination or thoughts are
[1:12:12] going to be so far removed from what the
[1:12:14] truth really
[1:12:15] is sometimes it's just
[1:12:20] you know it's like brother adam said
[1:12:22] just let it happen
[1:12:24] just let it come to pass don't worry
[1:12:26] about it
[1:12:27] you know we're enthused we're excited
[1:12:31] we're expecting we're we're in
[1:12:34] anticipation
[1:12:35] for the coming of the lord for the
[1:12:37] rapture
[1:12:38] but it's not that it changes and
[1:12:41] and makes our lives something different
[1:12:43] than what god's called us to do
[1:12:46] amen that's that's just moving outside
[1:12:48] of the realm of what god's called us to
[1:12:50] do
[1:12:51] remember last week program said if you
[1:12:53] plant potatoes just keep planting them
[1:12:56] right if i was building a house and i
[1:12:58] knew god was coming tomorrow i'd keep
[1:13:00] building on that house
[1:13:02] or that church or those potatoes or
[1:13:05] whatever
[1:13:05] i want to be found faithful at the post
[1:13:09] where god's put me what god has set
[1:13:11] before me
[1:13:12] i want to be found faithful doing that
[1:13:15] whatever it is
[1:13:16] amen you see now that's the simplicity
[1:13:19] of it
[1:13:21] look ninth verse for as the heavens are
[1:13:25] higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:13:27] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:13:28] and your thoughts
[1:13:29] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:13:32] from heaven and return it thought
[1:13:33] thither but
[1:13:34] water it uh water at the earth and make
[1:13:36] it bring forth
[1:13:38] and bud that it may give seed to the
[1:13:41] sower and bread to the eater
[1:13:43] so shall that's just a metaphor parable
[1:13:47] of of what the point god's trying to
[1:13:49] make
[1:13:50] through isaiah of course so shall my
[1:13:52] word
[1:13:53] be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:13:56] his word see it shall not return unto me
[1:14:00] void
[1:14:01] but it shall accomplish that which i
[1:14:03] have pleased and shall
[1:14:05] prosper in the thing whereunto i sent it
[1:14:08] so if god's promised word is
[1:14:10] that faith cometh by hearing and you are
[1:14:14] hearing then what is going on inside you
[1:14:18] what is going on in your spiritual life
[1:14:23] god is bringing and adding faith to you
[1:14:26] whether you realize it or know it or not
[1:14:29] because
[1:14:30] that's the promise of his word
[1:14:33] he didn't ask you to feel it he just
[1:14:35] asked you to believe it
[1:14:37] and you just have to believe it that
[1:14:39] what he said it's not going to return
[1:14:42] void faith comes by hearing and if his
[1:14:45] word's going out
[1:14:46] it's going to do what he said it's going
[1:14:48] to do yes it's not going to return to
[1:14:50] him void just like the water that comes
[1:14:52] down
[1:14:53] and and waters the seed it brings forth
[1:14:56] life
[1:14:57] his word does the same thing it's coming
[1:15:00] into you
[1:15:00] and it's watering that seed and it's
[1:15:02] bringing forth life
[1:15:04] and as you need it it will be there so
[1:15:07] friend my
[1:15:08] belief here is and what i'm trying to
[1:15:10] say about this faith
[1:15:12] is that when when when the time is
[1:15:15] whatever time it is i know brother
[1:15:17] brahma said the rapture is overdue
[1:15:19] and the bride get herself ready the last
[1:15:21] one to come in
[1:15:22] or that last one to come in that last
[1:15:24] seed to come in which kind of became a
[1:15:27] little bit of a
[1:15:28] a sweep of the ministry a few years back
[1:15:31] it seemed like every preacher was
[1:15:32] preaching about that last seed
[1:15:34] and and that is true brother adam did
[1:15:36] say that that
[1:15:38] lassie to come in well what is that
[1:15:41] that last seed coming in doesn't have
[1:15:44] anything to do
[1:15:45] with your faith you understand what i'm
[1:15:48] saying
[1:15:49] it doesn't have anything to do with
[1:15:51] whether you have
[1:15:52] perfect faith or rapturing faith or not
[1:15:55] that is a timing element
[1:15:59] and that was the other element that i'm
[1:16:00] telling you about about the rapture
[1:16:03] yes the rapturing faith has got to be in
[1:16:05] place with the bride
[1:16:07] but it's got to be a timing element and
[1:16:09] that timing element is
[1:16:11] as he said that when that last seed
[1:16:14] comes in
[1:16:15] now what does that mean i don't know
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:18] now i would say it means when the last
[1:16:22] predestinated seed of these church ages
[1:16:25] has come and received the holy ghost
[1:16:28] that that that would be that last seed
[1:16:30] but now does that mean
[1:16:31] as soon as they're baptized receive the
[1:16:34] holy ghost
[1:16:35] do do they do they themselves need to
[1:16:39] attain to a place of that rapturing
[1:16:41] faith themselves first
[1:16:43] right now i don't know i can't tell you
[1:16:45] those things i just know what he said
[1:16:48] and what he said is when that last scene
[1:16:50] then the rapture will go
[1:16:52] are so many words don't quote me on that
[1:16:54] but so many words
[1:16:56] when that last seed comes in what does
[1:16:59] that mean
[1:17:00] well that just means that it's a timing
[1:17:02] element when that last seed comes
[1:17:04] and the then the bride internationally
[1:17:07] after she's listened to the word she's
[1:17:10] feasted on the word of god the message
[1:17:12] of the hour the
[1:17:14] the truth of god's word she has garnered
[1:17:16] then that faith is common it's built in
[1:17:19] her and it's become to a place
[1:17:21] that that as it is needed it becomes
[1:17:24] evident
[1:17:25] it becomes tangible then because you
[1:17:28] need it then
[1:17:29] it comes to a place where that rapturing
[1:17:31] faith takes over
[1:17:33] yes in your life i mean how
[1:17:36] how many of you we've had a lot of
[1:17:39] testimonies here recently i i've
[1:17:41] exhorted that
[1:17:42] because i i i want to be honest i'm
[1:17:45] proud of it
[1:17:47] not uh carnally proud but uh
[1:17:50] loving my congregation proud and my lord
[1:17:53] proud
[1:17:54] and and and all that goes with that the
[1:17:56] testimonies the miracles that god's been
[1:17:58] doing with us
[1:18:00] in this church how many testimonies we
[1:18:02] have today four or five
[1:18:03] i mean just we have more testimonies and
[1:18:05] prayer requests i like that
[1:18:07] amen amen that's just tremendous how god
[1:18:10] is doing
[1:18:11] and what god is doing but when that when
[1:18:13] that
[1:18:14] situation arose you don't you may not
[1:18:17] have known
[1:18:18] that that you had the faith to meet that
[1:18:20] challenge
[1:18:22] but when the challenge came when the
[1:18:24] opportunity presented itself
[1:18:26] the faith was there to meet it yeah
[1:18:28] hallelujah
[1:18:30] well your the faith was always there
[1:18:33] and see that's that's the thing that
[1:18:36] i've been
[1:18:36] challenged with my whole ministry and
[1:18:38] i've heard from so many people
[1:18:40] for so long and used to believe and fall
[1:18:43] in line myself
[1:18:46] but fred i've come to understand by the
[1:18:49] word
[1:18:50] and by the promises of god's word that
[1:18:53] god's bride is getting to that place or
[1:18:55] she is at that place
[1:18:57] if we're that close friend she is at
[1:18:59] that place
[1:19:00] if we're that close she's there at that
[1:19:03] place where she's
[1:19:04] gotten internationally now the bride
[1:19:08] not the church not the pretenders the
[1:19:11] true
[1:19:11] bride the living and remain have got to
[1:19:14] that place
[1:19:16] that in them when the challenge comes
[1:19:18] it'll be there to meet it
[1:19:22] won't if there won't be a necessity of
[1:19:24] of some emergency prayer meeting
[1:19:26] right there won't be a a a place of
[1:19:29] saying oh i've got to get a bunch of
[1:19:31] faith here real quick or something
[1:19:33] it's going to be there yes amen my
[1:19:36] proclamation to you friends today is it
[1:19:38] is there
[1:19:40] you may not realize it but the last time
[1:19:43] you needed some kind of a healing faith
[1:19:45] some kind of a supernatural faith
[1:19:48] and and and and the challenge came
[1:19:51] that faith met that challenge yes amen
[1:19:55] amen my own grandson today
[1:19:59] and his testimony oh my just just
[1:20:02] bless your heart because you know what
[1:20:04] he goes through yeah and and i know
[1:20:06] most of the times that we testify things
[1:20:08] i
[1:20:09] you know me and my wife especially are
[1:20:11] very privy to a lot of those things you
[1:20:13] might not know the details and stuff
[1:20:15] and how and how when you see me react
[1:20:18] and when you see my heart explode like
[1:20:20] it does
[1:20:21] you just you just don't know yeah
[1:20:23] sometimes you all
[1:20:24] just don't know when a sister brother or
[1:20:26] son when there's a testimony that takes
[1:20:28] place you just don't know that what
[1:20:29] what the underlying of that is and what
[1:20:32] a miracle it is
[1:20:33] right that god stepped forth and
[1:20:35] supernaturally
[1:20:36] did what he did well that was a faith
[1:20:38] that met that
[1:20:40] there was a faith that met that
[1:20:42] challenge yeah
[1:20:43] if i have that faith you have that faith
[1:20:46] we all have that faith together there's
[1:20:48] nothing that this church that that you
[1:20:50] as
[1:20:51] and we as a body of believers couldn't
[1:20:53] do nothing
[1:20:54] that's right not one thing
[1:20:57] first and foremost we make sure it's the
[1:20:59] will of the lord
[1:21:00] right the will of the lord is first and
[1:21:03] foremost
[1:21:04] that's the position that's the placement
[1:21:06] it's got to be according to the will of
[1:21:08] the lord
[1:21:09] i know brother graham said the rapture
[1:21:10] was overdue
[1:21:12] when he when the bride gets itself ready
[1:21:15] well what's that ready
[1:21:16] could just be as simple as that last
[1:21:18] season coming in because it's going to
[1:21:19] be an entire body
[1:21:21] yes from the toes to the crown of your
[1:21:24] head
[1:21:25] it's going to be a whole body from the
[1:21:26] first church age to the last
[1:21:28] it's going to be an entire body it
[1:21:31] started out in the feet coming out
[1:21:32] through the torso
[1:21:33] into the head into the intelligence in
[1:21:35] this last age
[1:21:38] but it makes up an entire body yes god's
[1:21:40] coming after a perfect bride
[1:21:42] she is without spot wrinkle and blemish
[1:21:45] she is a perfect bride
[1:21:46] she doesn't have the tip of her pinky
[1:21:48] finger missing
[1:21:49] right she's coming down to the various i
[1:21:52] believe brother noel johnson said one
[1:21:53] time to the very bottom of the skin on
[1:21:55] the bottom of your foot
[1:21:58] he's coming for a bride yes a whole
[1:22:02] bride a whole person yeah amen
[1:22:05] from the beginning to the end that's
[1:22:07] what he's coming for
[1:22:09] and there can't be one thing out of
[1:22:11] place there's one thing out of place
[1:22:13] it's not going to happen but don't you
[1:22:16] think for a minute

[1:22:26] marriage supper
[1:22:28] that's god's not up there doing that
[1:22:30] right amen sometimes
[1:22:32] i've heard things that would make you
[1:22:34] almost think like that that god is
[1:22:36] setting up there
[1:22:36] and he's just you know arms cross just
[1:22:39] waiting for us to get ready
[1:22:40] just just go ahead and get ready so i
[1:22:43] can rap you now
[1:22:45] it's that's not god's not doing that
[1:22:47] right
[1:22:48] there's a place there's a time there's
[1:22:51] god's perfect
[1:22:52] will yes everything about it falls in
[1:22:55] line
[1:22:55] if we're according to this truth if
[1:22:58] we're a part of that word
[1:23:00] yes amen if we're part of that bride
[1:23:02] then we're part of all of what god's
[1:23:04] doing
[1:23:05] through revelation through faith that
[1:23:08] faith come by hearing
[1:23:09] hearing the word of god amen i want to
[1:23:12] give you example here in a minute but
[1:23:14] let me read this quote to you
[1:23:16] spiritual food and due seasons and i
[1:23:18] want you to get to build up now
[1:23:20] this holy oracles of god in the faith
[1:23:23] the faith of this
[1:23:24] hour amen the faith of this hour the
[1:23:27] faith
[1:23:28] is going to take more faith than ever
[1:23:30] was in
[1:23:31] any age for this has to be
[1:23:34] rapturing faith to be taken up right
[1:23:38] this has to be in this last day
[1:23:41] rapturing faith to be taken up what
[1:23:44] brings faith
[1:23:46] the word what had there
[1:23:49] to come in this last age
[1:23:53] to bring that kind of faith
[1:23:56] the word right amen the truth
[1:23:59] of the word of god brought through a
[1:24:02] vindicated prophet
[1:24:04] to a bride of christ revealed to her
[1:24:07] heart
[1:24:08] to show her who she is to bring
[1:24:11] faith into her heart for a body change
[1:24:15] it could only have happened in this last
[1:24:17] day
[1:24:18] you said oh they had great faith back
[1:24:20] then all kind of miracles and things
[1:24:22] that took place absolutely they did
[1:24:24] pentecost you think of the great faith
[1:24:27] they had at pentecost and the miracles
[1:24:29] through the book of acts all the
[1:24:31] miracles that took place
[1:24:32] how could they have not had rapturing
[1:24:34] faith
[1:24:35] wasn't time for it right i had to go
[1:24:39] through all the church ages
[1:24:40] see going to the ground come back forth
[1:24:42] had to die rock come back into this last
[1:24:45] day
[1:24:45] to take all those words because see god
[1:24:47] had a gentile bride he had to get her
[1:24:49] together right
[1:24:50] that wild olive tree had to be grafted
[1:24:52] in
[1:24:53] and bring all those loose ends from all
[1:24:55] those church ages to this last age to
[1:24:58] bring a message
[1:24:59] to bring the truth of a word to bring a
[1:25:02] bride to the place that she realizes
[1:25:05] in that word who she is and that faith
[1:25:08] coming by
[1:25:08] hearing that word amen to produce a
[1:25:11] rapture
[1:25:12] what did he say could not happen till
[1:25:14] this last day
[1:25:16] had to be in this last day and this is
[1:25:19] the day that we're living we're at the
[1:25:20] end of that
[1:25:24] it feels like sometimes we're past the
[1:25:26] end of that
[1:25:27] we're not we can't get ahead of god but
[1:25:30] we're at the end of that
[1:25:31] it's not some gift all the gifts of
[1:25:34] prophecies everything but it was in
[1:25:35] brother brown's ministry
[1:25:37] that was just catch attention to people
[1:25:38] that was first second pull
[1:25:40] that didn't mean anything or it meant
[1:25:42] something but it wasn't what god was
[1:25:43] using
[1:25:44] to bring this bride to the place where
[1:25:46] she's in rapture and condition
[1:25:48] a rapturing faith it didn't say
[1:25:51] faith comes by
[1:25:54] prophecies it didn't say faith comes by
[1:25:58] tongue speaking it didn't say faith
[1:26:01] comes by supernatural healing
[1:26:03] no faith comes by the word
[1:26:08] hearing the word right the word
[1:26:11] ministered to you
[1:26:15] though it be from a minister or you
[1:26:17] reading it yourself
[1:26:18] and the holy ghost ministering to you
[1:26:21] because it's a holy ghost
[1:26:22] anyway if it's a true minister of god
[1:26:24] it's it's the holy spirit
[1:26:26] ministering in any way whether it's
[1:26:28] somebody standing up here whether it's
[1:26:29] you reading and god
[1:26:30] revealing it straight from his work same
[1:26:33] same god
[1:26:34] same holy spirit same difference
[1:26:37] brings the same results in this last day
[1:26:40] has to be that way not a first bull not
[1:26:43] a second poll
[1:26:44] not miracles healings testimonies
[1:26:48] all the those are all fine and good
[1:26:51] friends that would just get people's
[1:26:52] attention
[1:26:53] but when you go and i've done a lot of
[1:26:55] fishing in my life
[1:26:57] done sainting i've done uh cast netting
[1:27:00] and
[1:27:01] you throw out the cast i used to do that
[1:27:02] in florida you throw it a cast net
[1:27:04] you pull it in you get all kind of stuff
[1:27:06] yeah i hate rocks and
[1:27:08] and and pieces of wood and you know i
[1:27:11] get some of the
[1:27:12] little fish i'm looking for for bait but
[1:27:14] i get other stuff too
[1:27:15] i get things we just toss those back
[1:27:18] that's not what i was looking for
[1:27:20] that's not what i threw it out there for
[1:27:21] i threw it out there to get this
[1:27:22] specific fish so i could go fishing with
[1:27:25] him
[1:27:25] that's what i threw him out for
[1:27:28] so that that that the the
[1:27:32] testimonies the the miracles the
[1:27:34] healings the
[1:27:35] the prophecies that that was just all
[1:27:36] just to get the attention of the people
[1:27:39] so you can say well this one and then
[1:27:41] this one and then this one
[1:27:44] because that's what god came for look at
[1:27:46] this look away to jesus
[1:27:48] so now i'm going to say something you
[1:27:50] probably heard this just this
[1:27:52] quote i think i've probably read it
[1:27:54] before
[1:27:56] but to me it's very powerful because
[1:27:57] december 1963 look away to jesus so now
[1:28:01] i'm going to say something to you now
[1:28:02] that i haven't said all along
[1:28:05] and that is the thing that we've uh
[1:28:07] looked for for so long for us many
[1:28:10] years four or five years maybe longer
[1:28:12] the third poll has now
[1:28:14] been vindicated and i'm sure you know
[1:28:16] what it is
[1:28:18] now vindicated is something to say well
[1:28:21] the third poll was here
[1:28:22] but now it's made itself known third
[1:28:26] part has many
[1:28:27] elements to it and the message isn't
[1:28:29] about the third poll
[1:28:30] but the third poll has many elements
[1:28:33] about it
[1:28:34] the most prominent element is the
[1:28:36] revealing of the word the opening of the
[1:28:38] word
[1:28:38] right because there had to be an opening
[1:28:40] of the word for all the other elements
[1:28:41] to become
[1:28:42] part of it that opening of the word
[1:28:45] what's the word the word is jesus christ
[1:28:47] christ is the word vindicating itself so
[1:28:50] what is he saying
[1:28:51] the third poll has now been vindicated
[1:28:53] i'm sure you know what it is
[1:28:54] the third pull opening of the word
[1:28:57] december
[1:28:58] 63. okay
[1:29:01] now remember there'll never be any
[1:29:03] impersonation of that
[1:29:05] because it can't be now notice satan can
[1:29:07] impersonate all these gifts
[1:29:09] right the prophecies the speaking in
[1:29:11] tongues the
[1:29:12] the the miracles the healings hey
[1:29:14] miracles healings yeah
[1:29:15] you don't believe so go to revelation
[1:29:17] 13. amen
[1:29:19] miracles because of miracles that he
[1:29:21] does many people follow him
[1:29:23] right all those no it's those
[1:29:27] the tests the uh miracles and all the
[1:29:29] things that took place
[1:29:32] the devil can impersonate those things
[1:29:36] he can impersonate those uh prophecies
[1:29:39] or or that tongue speaking or whatever
[1:29:41] he can impersonate those little gifts
[1:29:42] and things
[1:29:43] but what he can't do is bring that word
[1:29:46] word by word it is pure
[1:29:49] condition now you can hybrid it like he
[1:29:52] did to eve in the garden of eden
[1:29:54] he brought 99 of it to her
[1:29:57] but you saw what that one percent calls
[1:30:00] the 1
[1:30:01] error cost and satan cannot bring that
[1:30:03] word word by word
[1:30:04] if he could friend he would have come
[1:30:06] through the blood of christ he'd be your
[1:30:08] brother
[1:30:09] right but he can't that's why there
[1:30:11] can't be an impersonation of this
[1:30:13] because the opening of that word and the
[1:30:16] revealing of christ to this last day
[1:30:19] brought a creation power to not just the
[1:30:23] prophet
[1:30:23] but to the bride of christ for this last
[1:30:25] day yeah
[1:30:27] it brought a creative power you hear
[1:30:29] what i'm saying yes
[1:30:31] those the storm going and the squirrels
[1:30:33] and all those things those were just
[1:30:35] things that god used to vindicate a
[1:30:37] prophet to show
[1:30:38] that that was just the wave sheath to
[1:30:40] show that this bride
[1:30:41] is in the same position to do what he
[1:30:44] did
[1:30:44] right because it's the same god amen
[1:30:48] we're his children filled with his holy
[1:30:50] spirit
[1:30:51] we're the same people god has created
[1:30:54] that for us
[1:30:55] that was just an example well what is
[1:30:58] the one thing that satan cannot do
[1:31:00] he cannot create yes
[1:31:04] because the pure word is a creation
[1:31:08] jesus said let in the beginning god said
[1:31:11] god
[1:31:12] created how did god create he spoke the
[1:31:16] word
[1:31:16] spoke and created a pure unadulterated
[1:31:20] word of god
[1:31:21] came forth and created the earth the
[1:31:24] heavens the universe the galaxies
[1:31:26] whatever
[1:31:27] however far it goes i'm not smart enough
[1:31:29] to know all that
[1:31:31] he created it by his work he spoke it
[1:31:34] created
[1:31:35] with the word then spoken out of him
[1:31:39] created what does the same word spoken
[1:31:41] out of a believer today do
[1:31:43] right it does the exact same thing yes
[1:31:47] how do you think healing comes how do
[1:31:48] you think deliverance comes
[1:31:50] that's just you speaking that and
[1:31:52] bringing about
[1:31:54] what you said would happen
[1:31:58] it's a creation satan can't do that
[1:32:00] that's why satan can't heal
[1:32:02] satan can't heal because healing's a
[1:32:04] creation
[1:32:06] amen he perverts and makes you sick
[1:32:09] he perverts and sends things down the
[1:32:11] gutter but he cannot create
[1:32:16] that's why faith operates by love
[1:32:19] there's not a single solitary fiber of
[1:32:22] love in satan
[1:32:24] not one not a speck people worship him
[1:32:28] people love him people try to go into
[1:32:31] the imaginations of satan
[1:32:33] but he has not one single fiber in his
[1:32:36] being of love for that person not one
[1:32:40] they want to go be with him they think
[1:32:42] hell is going to be so much more fun
[1:32:45] than heaven i know you've heard that
[1:32:49] garbage too
[1:32:51] but there's not what they don't know is
[1:32:53] there's not one
[1:32:54] single cell not a single atom or however
[1:32:59] we are made up in him to love that
[1:33:02] person
[1:33:03] to love anybody love operates the faith
[1:33:07] creation
[1:33:08] he cannot do it all these gifts and
[1:33:11] things he can impersonate but he cannot
[1:33:14] create
[1:33:15] it's a pure word
[1:33:20] the third poll has been vindicated
[1:33:21] there'll never be any impersonation of
[1:33:23] that cause it cannot be
[1:33:25] now it's in existence he said now it's
[1:33:28] in existence and i warned of this right
[1:33:30] soon
[1:33:31] right at this time now it's just
[1:33:33] happened so it could identify
[1:33:35] he said it's just happened so it can
[1:33:37] identify
[1:33:38] its presence among you see but it will
[1:33:42] not be used in a great way until this
[1:33:44] council begins to tighten up
[1:33:46] when it does when the things of
[1:33:48] pentecostals so forth can almost
[1:33:50] impersonate anything that can be done
[1:33:52] but when that time comes
[1:33:54] when the squeeze comes down then you'll
[1:33:56] see what you've seen temporarily
[1:33:58] be manifested in the fullness of its
[1:34:00] power
[1:34:02] where by whom
[1:34:07] you're looking at the bride of jesus
[1:34:10] christ
[1:34:11] internationally endued with that same
[1:34:15] power
[1:34:15] yes what did he tell him on the day of
[1:34:17] pentecost
[1:34:19] he told him they would be endued with
[1:34:22] power from on high
[1:34:23] yes were they amen are we
[1:34:27] you better believe it amen
[1:34:30] praise the lord as that holy spirit
[1:34:32] comes sweeping through there on the day
[1:34:33] of pentecost
[1:34:34] and it does the same thing yes amen amen
[1:34:37] i don't know if you ever feel or know it
[1:34:39] for him but he comes and sweeps through
[1:34:40] this place every time we're here
[1:34:43] every time without fail i pray for him
[1:34:46] every time
[1:34:47] and he is without fail every time amen
[1:34:50] amen praise the lord
[1:34:52] now i must continue evangelism he talks
[1:34:54] about
[1:34:56] um he said so the third pull is here let
[1:34:59] me move down because my time is out
[1:35:01] he said now this third pull will be the
[1:35:04] thing he said now to my opinion
[1:35:06] he said this will be the thing to my
[1:35:08] opinion i don't say the lord tells me
[1:35:11] this
[1:35:11] this will be the thing that will start
[1:35:13] the rapturing faith
[1:35:15] for the going away for the rapture
[1:35:19] what is that that's the word that's the
[1:35:22] third poll
[1:35:23] that's the manifestation of the the
[1:35:26] revelation
[1:35:27] of god's word to his people faith comes
[1:35:30] by hearing
[1:35:31] it's not complicated it's not hard
[1:35:34] people want to make it hard
[1:35:36] people want to complicate and scruple it
[1:35:37] all up even ministers try to
[1:35:40] bring all these things out friend it's
[1:35:41] not that hard
[1:35:43] it's not that complicated and it's not
[1:35:45] something that you got to sit there and
[1:35:47] say i got to work something up no
[1:35:49] faith comes by hearing if you're
[1:35:50] listening to the word if you're reading
[1:35:52] the word if god's revealing the holy
[1:35:54] spirit come
[1:35:55] revealing that true word of god for this
[1:35:58] day
[1:35:58] in your heart you are being endued with
[1:36:01] that power
[1:36:03] with that faith and it's in you
[1:36:06] it's that's why it's so important not
[1:36:09] not
[1:36:10] to let it rust or rot or sit on the
[1:36:12] shelf
[1:36:13] but to read it and listen to it to come
[1:36:16] to church
[1:36:17] to put on the tapes to do what you can
[1:36:19] to make sure that you're being fed the
[1:36:21] right kind of diet
[1:36:22] yes the right kind of food because
[1:36:25] faith comes from that yes amen that's
[1:36:28] where faith comes from
[1:36:30] now with this last i'm going to try to
[1:36:32] make this short
[1:36:34] with this last part of that word coming
[1:36:36] in
[1:36:37] look the type that we have
[1:36:41] of this of this body change this type
[1:36:44] that we have
[1:36:46] brother branham comes from abraham and
[1:36:48] sarah
[1:36:50] that that's that's the scriptural
[1:36:52] precedent that god
[1:36:53] uses when he talks about a body change
[1:36:57] bringing forth the promised son first of
[1:37:00] all there's got to be a body change to
[1:37:02] bring forth christ
[1:37:03] in your life you've got to be changed
[1:37:05] before life before christ could ever
[1:37:06] become evident in your life
[1:37:08] manifested through you you've got to be
[1:37:10] a different person than what you were
[1:37:12] when you were born
[1:37:13] amen now your skin's still on you and
[1:37:15] you still look the same
[1:37:16] but you yourself have changed you've
[1:37:19] become a new creature
[1:37:20] in christ jesus amen so as that has
[1:37:23] changed we know the element already
[1:37:25] exists in you
[1:37:28] so the precedent that we have abraham
[1:37:30] and sarah
[1:37:31] when when god waited so long because it
[1:37:34] has to be
[1:37:35] remember in god's time yes
[1:37:39] abraham can say god where are you you
[1:37:42] told me five years ago this was going to
[1:37:44] happen i'm waiting
[1:37:46] where are you god 10 years 15 years
[1:37:51] did you did i did i hear you wrong lord
[1:37:54] it's been 15 years and i still don't
[1:37:56] have it 20 years
[1:37:57] 20 years and he's still not here
[1:38:00] but the bible says even though genesis
[1:38:03] shows a little different story
[1:38:06] if you go in the new testament you find
[1:38:07] out that god records about abraham
[1:38:10] that he wavered not right it looks like
[1:38:14] in genesis he wavered if you read it and
[1:38:16] you think of it intellectually
[1:38:18] but if you read the book of acts romans
[1:38:20] i believe
[1:38:21] uh it tells you that he wavered mine
[1:38:24] right
[1:38:25] through unbelief but was strong giving
[1:38:28] praise to god
[1:38:30] to know that what was impossible was
[1:38:33] going to become possible because of the
[1:38:35] promise of god's word
[1:38:37] it seems impossible friend that we would
[1:38:39] go in a rapture
[1:38:40] it seems impossible it is absolutely
[1:38:42] illogical
[1:38:43] it's against science it's against
[1:38:45] medicine it's against anything and
[1:38:47] everything these
[1:38:48] uh uh atheists out here can prove that's
[1:38:51] fair
[1:38:53] but there's gonna be a body change yes
[1:38:56] just like abraham and sarah
[1:38:59] they had faith you say wait a minute
[1:39:01] they had faith
[1:39:03] hebrews 11. hebrews 11
[1:39:06] 8 by faith abraham when he was called to
[1:39:10] go
[1:39:10] out into a place which he should after
[1:39:13] receive for an inheritance
[1:39:15] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[1:39:17] whether he went now is that faith or not
[1:39:21] a god he never saw heard over knew of or
[1:39:23] was not raised to worship
[1:39:25] told him to go somewhere and he said yes
[1:39:28] sir
[1:39:29] and he went i don't know where i'm going
[1:39:32] but i'm going to go anyhow right
[1:39:33] amen that's faith it was already in
[1:39:37] in abraham to know he followed it by
[1:39:40] faith he so adjourned in the land of
[1:39:42] promises in the strange country dwelling
[1:39:44] in tabernacles with isaac
[1:39:45] jacob the heirs with him with the same
[1:39:48] promise
[1:39:49] for he looked for a city whose
[1:39:50] foundations of which had foundations
[1:39:53] whose builder and maker is god
[1:39:55] faith through faith also
[1:39:58] sarah sarah herself receives strength
[1:40:04] body change
[1:40:07] because she was dead the bible tells us
[1:40:09] her mom was dead she was past the age of
[1:40:11] conceiving
[1:40:12] it was not scientifically medically
[1:40:15] possible
[1:40:16] at that time for sarah who had never
[1:40:18] bored a child
[1:40:19] to have a child right right it's just
[1:40:23] like they would
[1:40:24] say to noah it's never rained where's it
[1:40:27] gonna come from
[1:40:28] i don't know god just said so right amen
[1:40:31] her womb is dead she's an old woman how
[1:40:33] are you gonna have this child by her now
[1:40:35] i don't know but god said so amen in his
[1:40:38] time
[1:40:39] took 100 years for uh for noah
[1:40:43] 25 years for abraham god where is it 24
[1:40:46] years later where is he
[1:40:49] but it's going to be in his time yes he
[1:40:51] said when i had child slate he should
[1:40:52] have already been here no no no no
[1:40:55] no it's going to happen the way god
[1:40:57] wants it to happen when god wants to
[1:40:59] happen
[1:41:00] amen and that's exactly and now eight
[1:41:02] and now sarah herself received strength
[1:41:05] to conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:41:08] child when she was
[1:41:09] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:41:13] who had promised now if you go back to
[1:41:14] genesis
[1:41:15] you see when god told her or told
[1:41:18] abraham that
[1:41:19] he heard she heard it she laughed
[1:41:22] so how how could this happen how can
[1:41:25] this be
[1:41:27] god said so amen that's all that matters
[1:41:32] and when the time came and it was
[1:41:35] necessary that this child came forth
[1:41:38] the faith was there the faith was there
[1:41:42] you don't read anywhere where abraham
[1:41:44] and sarah had some great prayer meeting
[1:41:45] to make sure they had the faith to be
[1:41:48] able to conceive seed and to have a
[1:41:49] child
[1:41:51] you don't see anywhere in there oh sarah
[1:41:54] there's no way you can do it now you're
[1:41:56] you're a goner i'm an old man
[1:42:00] no it was there now if that's the type
[1:42:05] forgive me i'm closing if that's the
[1:42:07] type then where are we at today
[1:42:10] where are we at with this rapture and
[1:42:13] this rapturing faith today if that is
[1:42:15] our time
[1:42:18] some great supernatural event that
[1:42:20] happened to people so all there's got to
[1:42:22] be this great
[1:42:23] supernatural thing that will help
[1:42:25] increase our faith well friends
[1:42:27] what more do you think that could be a
[1:42:28] greater supernatural event
[1:42:30] than for all of our loved ones that have
[1:42:31] gone on to start showing up in front of
[1:42:33] us
[1:42:34] right
[1:42:37] but it's not going to be a it is
[1:42:41] it can spark a faith and i believe it
[1:42:43] will
[1:42:45] spark a faith but friend that that faith
[1:42:48] is going to be there because that word
[1:42:50] coming into your life that word coming
[1:42:53] into your heart
[1:42:54] and if you're not spending that time
[1:42:56] your that time with the word like you
[1:42:57] should then
[1:42:58] let me encourage you today yes amen
[1:43:02] spend that time with the lord spend that
[1:43:04] time in his word
[1:43:05] let that faith come let that faith build
[1:43:08] yes
[1:43:09] when you've ever when you've done that
[1:43:11] or you do that you know what i'm talking
[1:43:12] about
[1:43:13] and what it does but yet we get in here
[1:43:16] and we're
[1:43:17] in service and we're with one another
[1:43:18] and we think about the aches and pains
[1:43:20] and things going on it's well i don't
[1:43:21] have any faith at all
[1:43:22] yes you do yes you do
[1:43:26] it is there it was there when abraham
[1:43:28] and sarah needed it and it'll be there
[1:43:30] when you need it
[1:43:32] you just obey the word right it will do
[1:43:35] what it said it will do
[1:43:36] he will do what he said he would do
[1:43:40] amen praise the lord let's stand if we
[1:43:50] could
