[39:53] visit uh with us again today and
[39:55] as sister julie had mentioned the
[39:57] baptism went real well yesterday i
[39:59] thought
[40:00] very well water was quite cold
[40:03] i told a few including brother thomas
[40:05] said well i've used to baptize the
[40:06] tabernacle and that water was very cold
[40:09] this water was colder it was colder in
[40:13] rotterdam's pool
[40:14] than it was at the tabernacle that's
[40:16] about as cool as i have
[40:18] baptized anybody although i saw them
[40:21] break the ice in the river in north
[40:22] carolina to baptize my sister so
[40:24] wow when you want to get baptized you
[40:27] don't care how cold it is
[40:29] and if somebody wants to get baptized i
[40:31] don't care how cold it is so
[40:33] but we didn't do a lot of conversation
[40:34] we didn't do a lot of prayer
[40:36] we just got in the pool baptized and got
[40:38] out we come
[40:39] we conversed and and prayed outside the
[40:42] pool
[40:42] which uh which kind of worked very well
[40:45] uh enjoyed the fellowship too very much
[40:47] we sat around afterwards and talked and
[40:49] sat down by the pool with brother tom
[40:51] and it was a real blessing i think since
[40:53] julie set the sun a little too long
[40:56] but but it was a real blessing and i
[40:59] appreciate it enjoyed it and thank you
[41:00] so much for your prayers
[41:02] and continued prayers uh for maggie
[41:06] and uh of course sister julie's been
[41:08] claiming her family friend you notice
[41:09] that god is moving in your families yeah
[41:12] i've noticed i get a little bit here a
[41:13] little bit there for this one that one
[41:15] and the other but the lord is moving
[41:17] in our families and i pray for you all
[41:19] and for them all the time
[41:20] yes and i put them in the hands of the
[41:22] lord and trust and believe for salvation
[41:25] uh for each of them so i i believe it's
[41:28] it it a little bit at a time whatever
[41:31] god would do so it was a real honor to
[41:34] be able to baptize maggie yesterday and
[41:36] i believe god was with us so amen and
[41:39] again i appreciate your prayers so i'm
[41:40] thankful to be here today
[41:42] lord give us another beautiful day in
[41:43] tucson amen so let's stand to our feet
[41:46] if we could and
[41:48] we'll look in our bibles to isaiah
[41:55] i thought it came on my heart several
[41:56] weeks ago that
[41:58] i felt like i wanted to bring and of
[42:00] course with the
[42:02] being at home and streaming those couple
[42:04] of weeks i
[42:05] put this off just like i put last week's
[42:08] off a little bit
[42:11] it seems like each thought that the lord
[42:12] gives me kind of
[42:14] runs in continuity and kind of joins
[42:16] together a little bit even though
[42:18] there's some different scripture and
[42:20] different title and things like that
[42:22] they just
[42:22] they kind of dovetail so but i think
[42:24] that's kind of what everything's
[42:26] happening
[42:26] today anyway you see the world uniting
[42:29] and the world council uniting and all
[42:30] the churches all that they're all coming
[42:32] together you know but brother branham
[42:33] told us
[42:34] it's uniting time for the bride right
[42:36] what did he say
[42:37] uniting time and sign amen
[42:40] so that all dovetails together so it's
[42:42] gonna dovetail
[42:44] you man i've had brother john and
[42:45] different ones tell me uh
[42:47] so and so spoke on this and so and so
[42:49] said that and i said i have no idea
[42:51] but you know it doesn't matter because
[42:53] god's in control of it and god's in
[42:55] control of it
[42:56] then it all fits perfect the way it's
[42:57] supposed to so
[42:59] amen so isaiah chapter 60. i'm gonna
[43:02] read the first few verses but before we
[43:04] do let's bow our heads again for another
[43:05] word of prayer
[43:06] precious jesus father it is an honor and
[43:09] a privilege to be here lord once again
[43:11] in your house
[43:12] thank you for all that you've done for
[43:13] us through the week thanking you for the
[43:15] desire and the time the ability to be
[43:17] here today
[43:18] lord for this service god that you've
[43:20] given us we don't know
[43:21] how many more of these that we're going
[43:23] to have lord even brother branham said
[43:24] we may not even have
[43:26] a meet like this ever again we don't
[43:28] know lord
[43:29] but we're thankful god that regardless
[43:31] of what does happen and what tomorrow
[43:33] brings
[43:34] we know who holds tomorrow we know who
[43:36] holds next week if there is next month
[43:38] next year
[43:38] and god would just want to follow your
[43:40] leading and do what you would call for
[43:42] us to do each one in our lives
[43:44] be led by your spirit lord because
[43:46] that's all that matters to us in life
[43:48] we are sheep to the shepherd we have
[43:50] relinquished our rights we have
[43:52] relinquished our desires we have
[43:54] relinquished our will and our desires
[43:56] and our will and our purpose in life is
[43:58] only to serve you and to live for you
[44:00] and everything that you give us to do
[44:02] sometimes it means we just go about our
[44:04] daily business and we just live our
[44:05] lives
[44:06] sometimes it means you putting something
[44:08] on our heart to go here to go there to
[44:09] do this or that
[44:10] the lord whatever it is may we be
[44:12] faithful to do it
[44:13] may your word lord shine forth once
[44:15] again and shine forth in this place in
[44:18] this
[44:18] assembly that you've given us these
[44:20] beautiful people that have come here
[44:22] i love so dearly god bless them
[44:23] exceedingly bless those that are
[44:25] streaming
[44:26] lord bless each one lord let's put forth
[44:28] the effort lord in this service and all
[44:30] that's gone into making it a success in
[44:32] this place this church
[44:33] lord it's your work god and we give it
[44:35] into your hands and thank you for it
[44:37] lord we rebuke every demonic spirit
[44:39] every devil out of hell that would try
[44:41] to
[44:41] hurt or infiltrate or hinder this
[44:43] service in any way
[44:44] that you would get the glory and the
[44:46] honor and the praise for all that is
[44:47] said and done
[44:48] now speak from your word father once
[44:50] again and accomplish that in it which
[44:53] you would send it forth to us for
[44:55] as it not returned void and we give you
[44:57] all the praise honor and the glory for
[44:58] it in the name of the lord jesus christ
[45:00] amen amen amen isaiah chapter 60
[45:04] verse 1 says arise
[45:08] shine for thy light is come and the
[45:11] glory of the lord is risen upon thee
[45:14] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[45:17] earth and gross darkness the people
[45:20] but the lord shall rise upon thee and
[45:22] his glory
[45:23] shall be seen upon thee the gentiles
[45:26] shall
[45:27] come to thy light and the kings to the
[45:30] brightness of thy rising
[45:31] and you could be seated if you'd like
[45:34] it's a powerful statement it's powerful
[45:36] scripture
[45:37] many have spoken from i have a few times
[45:40] speaking on the darkness speaking on the
[45:42] gross darkness today the darkness in the
[45:44] land the gross darkness the people
[45:46] i really want to focus though on the
[45:48] first part of this today
[45:50] brother branham spoke a couple of
[45:51] messages well i spoke shalom a couple of
[45:53] times
[45:54] in the sierra vista phoenix and he takes
[45:56] this as one of his
[45:58] subject scriptures on a rise shine now
[46:03] it's it's hard sometimes because when
[46:05] you when you try to say it or you hear
[46:07] it in your mind
[46:08] or even as brother branham read it from
[46:10] the scripture if you go look at the
[46:11] shalom in sierra vista
[46:12] he says arise and shine but that's not
[46:15] what it says
[46:16] it says arise comma shine amen now
[46:19] there's really no difference and arise
[46:22] and shine or arise shine
[46:23] means the same thing but it all it it
[46:26] makes you feel like there's something
[46:28] through this conjunction
[46:29] that is a dual purpose that we're
[46:31] supposed to do so
[46:32] my title today is arise and
[46:36] shine rise and shine so i want to focus
[46:38] on the light today but let's
[46:40] let's get to a little bit of what's
[46:43] going on in the world today
[46:44] um we've gone through revelation 13 and
[46:47] i'm not going to get into all that again
[46:49] in the
[46:49] uh the politics and the political
[46:51] spectrum of it and
[46:52] and the scriptural part of the political
[46:54] spectrum and the commercialization and
[46:56] the love of money and
[46:57] all those things so we know all that's
[46:59] driven that's driven by the world but
[47:01] there's but god has given us something
[47:03] that rises us
[47:04] above that god has given us something to
[47:06] take us beyond that
[47:07] god has given us something that we can
[47:09] live here in this world but not be of
[47:11] the world
[47:12] god has given us something that we can
[47:14] be children of god
[47:15] and still be pilgrims here that we can
[47:17] still live in this world and we can
[47:18] still live for god
[47:20] and that god that and that purpose that
[47:22] god has given us
[47:23] is what's leading us through in this
[47:25] life that we grow unto the lord
[47:27] more and more like him that's the desire
[47:30] that we did
[47:30] that we have in our hearts that's what
[47:32] when the holy spirit come brother
[47:34] branham says the bride becomes the word
[47:36] he is the word and the two married
[47:38] together he said heaven and earth
[47:40] embrace
[47:40] one another right so if we're if that
[47:42] embraces took place then that light is
[47:44] shining
[47:45] amen so it says arise and shine the
[47:48] light is come but look what it also says
[47:51] for behold the darkness the darkness not
[47:54] a darkness but the darkness well we know
[47:57] what
[47:57] that the darkness is that the darkness
[48:00] is satan
[48:01] and we're living in satan's eden the
[48:02] devil the red dragon
[48:04] satan himself is that the darkness
[48:07] and that the darkness in satan's eden is
[48:09] covering this land
[48:11] right we know that never much more than
[48:13] never any more than it has been or
[48:15] is right now right that the darkness has
[48:18] covered this world now we're not talking
[48:20] about the fact that the sun's not
[48:22] shining
[48:22] we know that's not true or the moon's
[48:24] not shining we know that's not true the
[48:26] stars are still there
[48:27] moon's still there sun's still there
[48:28] it's beautiful and bright outside in
[48:30] tucson arizona
[48:32] but it's talking about the spiritual
[48:34] darkness that has now
[48:35] overcome the world that is now a gross
[48:39] darkness
[48:40] overcome the people a gross darkness so
[48:43] that gross
[48:44] uh we think we say the word gross we
[48:47] think oh that's nasty
[48:48] but that's not what this gross means
[48:50] it's not a nasty gross
[48:52] it means heavy thick
[48:55] black dark
[48:58] a thickness of darkness not just a
[49:02] regular darkness
[49:03] uh i've said this before but if i if any
[49:06] of you ever gone into a cave or a cavern
[49:08] or
[49:09] or colossal cave for example uh i know
[49:12] in colossal cave when brother branham
[49:13] went there
[49:14] brother branham got the inspiration when
[49:16] he went to the cave of
[49:18] there's a man here who can turn on the
[49:19] light brother branham got that sermon
[49:21] and that sermon title from that going in
[49:23] that cave
[49:24] and standing there you ever done it and
[49:27] you stand there and the man
[49:28] flips the switch off you can put your
[49:31] hand right here
[49:32] and you can't see a thing that's the
[49:35] gross darkness you know if you turn the
[49:37] light off it would get dark in here
[49:39] but it wouldn't get so dark that you
[49:42] couldn't see a little bit or have some
[49:44] in your pupils adjust and everything but
[49:46] the gross darkness is
[49:48] that there's such a total blindness that
[49:51] people are oblivious to the things
[49:53] that's going on around them
[49:54] now we know that was the promise of
[49:56] laodicea they would be poor
[49:58] visible blind wretched naked and not
[50:01] even know it
[50:02] how can they not know it because they're
[50:03] blind right the blind leaves the bond
[50:05] the blind's leading the blind they all
[50:07] fall in the ditch well how are they
[50:08] blind they got eyes they can see
[50:10] they have ears they can hear but they
[50:12] can't see
[50:13] spiritually they can't hear spiritually
[50:16] because a gross
[50:18] darkness has encompassed them and
[50:20] overcome them
[50:21] to where you could put a hand in front
[50:23] of them you could show in the bible
[50:25] exactly
[50:26] the way it's supposed to be and they
[50:27] won't see it right
[50:29] they won't believe it they can't see it
[50:31] right right that gross darkness has
[50:33] overcome them it's so heavy
[50:35] and it's so thick and this is that last
[50:37] day
[50:38] we're living in that last day we know
[50:40] that so if it's not going to be now when
[50:42] is it going to be
[50:44] such a religious gross darkness that are
[50:46] upon the people i'm not talking about a
[50:48] political darkness
[50:49] i'm not talking about a commercial or
[50:51] phys i'm talking about a spiritual
[50:53] darkness
[50:54] that has overcome the world amen and a
[50:56] gross darkness that has overcome the
[50:58] people it is so thick
[51:00] you can put something as plain as day in
[51:02] front of them and they cannot see it
[51:04] right they will not see it sometimes
[51:08] they refuse to see it that's right i
[51:10] mean me and brother tom's had
[51:11] conversations before you know brother
[51:13] tom does the
[51:14] the gym show every year which uh
[51:16] supposed to be pushed back this year but
[51:17] he sees
[51:18] tons of people all the time you know all
[51:20] kinds of people all walks of life
[51:22] all ages and and religions and spectrums
[51:25] and different countries and things and
[51:27] and uh you know and and when the lord
[51:30] puts it on his heart he tries to witness
[51:32] the people and talk to people and he
[51:33] said you just
[51:34] you just can't even hardly talk to
[51:36] people anymore you try to bring up a
[51:38] subject about god or about the bible
[51:40] well they don't even
[51:41] that god might be okay but they don't
[51:44] want to hear anything about the bible
[51:46] even religions and and people who call
[51:49] ourselves christians today
[51:50] don't even believe the bible right right
[51:53] they might think they follow it in a
[51:55] certain context but that's
[51:56] it if it crosses their doctrine or
[51:58] something they believe or think well
[52:00] they just do whatever they want to do
[52:01] right well the truth is they are in
[52:03] gross darkness
[52:05] and even though they can read a bible
[52:07] they don't know what it says
[52:08] there's no revelation there there's no
[52:10] light that shines upon it to bring it
[52:13] real to them
[52:14] so that's all they have that's all they
[52:16] know and that's all the denominations
[52:18] has done and in this world today yep
[52:20] brother brown told us
[52:22] there's such an extreme mental illness
[52:24] that has struck people
[52:26] there's such a mental illness that is
[52:28] going across the land today
[52:30] that that that people can't even
[52:32] understand common sense things
[52:35] right you've heard the phrase common
[52:37] sense isn't so common anymore
[52:39] well it you know that is true but this
[52:42] actually transcends even that uh
[52:46] it is so dark that they just can't even
[52:48] understand or see
[52:50] wow through the mental
[52:52] incompassibilities of their minds of
[52:54] their lives they just
[52:56] they do things that are just well
[53:00] not to be ironic but they do things that
[53:04] are
[53:05] uh that make no sense just
[53:08] idiocy forget about the hypocrisy
[53:13] forget about the uh it you know
[53:17] they can do this we can't do that we can
[53:20] do that they can't do this
[53:21] uh you know these people live by this
[53:25] and but but don't expect me to live by
[53:27] that well you have to do it that way but
[53:29] don't expect me to do it that way
[53:31] when it comes my turn i'm going to do
[53:32] whatever i want to do forget about the
[53:34] hypocrisy
[53:35] just the just absolute lapse of
[53:38] mental capacity to to understand common
[53:42] sense things
[53:43] is is almost completely eroded out of
[53:46] our society
[53:47] right mental illness has struck this and
[53:50] brother madam said it would
[53:51] he said it was then 60 years ago and he
[53:54] said it would even more
[53:56] how much more has it gotten to that
[53:58] place well why is it that way
[54:01] right because it's so dark amen
[54:04] there's so much darkness yes
[54:07] truth only comes through light yes
[54:10] truth doesn't come in darkness that's
[54:12] right truth only comes through light
[54:14] and unless there's a light to eliminate
[54:17] there's no way they can see
[54:18] and if they can't see how can they know
[54:21] and if they don't know how can they
[54:22] operate or act or live that way right
[54:25] they can't do it
[54:26] because it's gross darkness people don't
[54:29] want to know the truth
[54:30] don't bother anybody with the truth you
[54:33] can show
[54:34] facts you can show proof you can show
[54:37] even and scripturally in the bible
[54:39] and they don't care they had their own
[54:41] agendas
[54:42] they had their own way they had their
[54:44] own thoughts don't encumber me with the
[54:46] truth
[54:47] i i the truth is disrupting
[54:50] what i want to do what i want to
[54:52] accomplish
[54:53] so it it it falls into the poor
[54:56] miserable blind wretched naked
[54:58] category right and and as it does
[55:02] they don't know it but they don't want
[55:04] to know it
[55:05] right they desire not to know it their
[55:08] everything about them
[55:10] does not want to know now i'm going to
[55:12] come back to uh
[55:13] to this scripture because i want to get
[55:16] to our rise and shine before we end this
[55:19] in fact i want to major on that i only
[55:20] wanted to spend a few minutes on the
[55:22] dark part of it we've been talking about
[55:23] a dark part
[55:25] for several weeks now and how dark it is
[55:27] out there
[55:28] and what's going on out in the world
[55:29] today and how dark but to understand
[55:31] and get to the premise of why and how
[55:34] that it's got to that place
[55:37] first of all you turn down god and what
[55:40] you see in the world as i've said before
[55:42] what you see in the world today is
[55:43] nothing but the resulting effect
[55:45] of what happens to a nation and a world
[55:47] that has turned god down
[55:50] it's just the resulting effect of what
[55:52] happens
[55:55] and we're living here and we're living
[55:57] here but this is not our world
[56:00] this is not our this is not our home
[56:02] right amen this world
[56:03] cosmos is not our home this world earth
[56:06] is our home
[56:07] right we'll come back and live on this
[56:08] earth but this cosmos is not our home
[56:11] we'll get to that a little bit later
[56:12] but look at saint john chapter 3.
[56:16] saint john chapter 3 what jesus said
[56:20] uh we'll begin with the 14th verse
[56:23] one of the very first scriptures
[56:24] probably the very first scripture i ever
[56:26] learned
[56:26] in a baptist church is a little boy
[56:31] john 3 16.
[56:34] amen i learned to quote that about as
[56:37] soon as i learned how to talk
[56:39] amen and it's and it's a wonderful
[56:41] scripture it's a good scripture
[56:43] but that but john 3 16
[56:46] has to be married with matthew 1
[56:50] uh 18 i believe it is where jesus said i
[56:54] come
[56:54] i come to save my people
[56:58] amen let me see if i can find that
[57:00] because then they can we can couple
[57:01] those two together
[57:08] he come to save his people from their
[57:10] sins his people
[57:12] amen 20 matthew 1 21 excuse me i got
[57:17] that completely wrong but it is
[57:18] matthew 1 21 and she shall bring forth a
[57:21] son
[57:22] and shall call his name jesus for he
[57:25] shall save his people from their sins
[57:29] and you've got to couple that with john
[57:31] 3 16 to come up with a correct
[57:34] understanding of the bible right if you
[57:36] just take 3
[57:37] john 3 16 alone you would think well
[57:40] every human ever born is going to be
[57:42] there
[57:42] every human ever born is going to make
[57:44] it god come that every human
[57:47] no matter how wicked or evil or whatever
[57:50] they did
[57:51] they're going to be okay in the end you
[57:53] think because
[57:54] for god so loved the world amen
[57:58] but you have to understand that matthew
[58:01] 1 21 has to go with it
[58:02] right right he jesus shall save
[58:06] his people only his people what did we
[58:09] say before
[58:10] god's not responsible for those that
[58:12] aren't his right
[58:13] i'm not responsible for my next door
[58:15] neighbor their house their land
[58:17] i'm not responsible their children their
[58:19] cattle i'm not responsible for anything
[58:20] it's theirs i'm responsible before god
[58:23] what's mine right that's what i'm
[58:26] responsible for
[58:27] right jesus god is responsible for those
[58:30] that are his
[58:31] amen and those that are his are the ones
[58:33] he came to redeem
[58:35] brother madam called them the redeemable
[58:38] i don't know if you find that in the
[58:39] dictionary but that's what brother
[58:41] branham called them the redeemable
[58:44] so that's what i'll say he said the
[58:47] redeemable
[58:48] god came to redeem those that were
[58:49] redeemable
[58:51] his people john 3 14 9 as moses
[58:55] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[58:57] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[59:00] the whosoever believeth in him should
[59:02] not perish but have
[59:04] eternal life he said well this person
[59:06] believes on it this person believes on
[59:08] him everybody believes on him
[59:09] everybody believes there's a god anybody
[59:12] that says they believe god
[59:15] believe in him should not perish but
[59:16] have everlasting life
[59:18] well um if you believe in something
[59:21] you're going to live it
[59:22] right if you believe in something you're
[59:25] going to act like it
[59:26] you're going to it's going to be
[59:27] produced from your actions from your
[59:29] life
[59:30] people say they believe god but there's
[59:32] no production of jesus in their lives
[59:35] so they can say they believe him but do
[59:37] they
[59:38] well obviously they don't because their
[59:40] fruits bear out what they
[59:41] are and what they believe that's right
[59:43] for god so loved the world that he gave
[59:45] his
[59:46] only begotten son that whosoever
[59:48] believeth in him should not perish but
[59:50] have everlasting life
[59:52] for god sent not his son into the world
[59:54] to condemn the world but that
[59:56] the world through him might be saved
[59:59] he that believeth on him is not
[1:00:01] condemned but he that believeth
[1:00:03] not is condemned already because he hath
[1:00:07] not believed in the name of the only
[1:00:09] begotten son of god now listen to this
[1:00:12] and this is the con uh condemnation
[1:00:16] that light amen light
[1:00:19] has come into the world jesus christ was
[1:00:23] the
[1:00:23] apex epitome the the
[1:00:27] fullness of that light that light was
[1:00:29] that
[1:00:30] life that life was zoe zoe
[1:00:33] the literal life of god amen amen
[1:00:37] come into the world that light is coming
[1:00:41] to the world and men
[1:00:42] loved darkness rather than light
[1:00:45] because their deeds were evil now why do
[1:00:49] people want to live
[1:00:50] in darkness today because their deeds
[1:00:52] are evil
[1:00:53] why do they want to stay and grow start
[1:00:55] why would somebody
[1:00:57] i mean just think if you were in that
[1:00:59] cave and a man turned the light off
[1:01:01] and you could not see your hand right
[1:01:03] here would you want to stay that way
[1:01:06] i don't think there's a person in that
[1:01:08] cave including the man that turned
[1:01:10] the light off that wouldn't want to stay
[1:01:11] that way
[1:01:13] they wouldn't want a little bit of light
[1:01:15] at least to get out of there
[1:01:17] amen something right but people stay
[1:01:20] that way
[1:01:21] and they remain in that condition
[1:01:23] purposefully
[1:01:24] because their deeds are wicked
[1:01:28] amen their deeds are wicked and they
[1:01:30] love the darkness rather than the light
[1:01:32] because of it
[1:01:33] they want to stay in the darkness
[1:01:36] because their deeds
[1:01:37] are not manifest in the darkness you
[1:01:40] can't see anything
[1:01:41] nothing is made known nothing is
[1:01:44] revealed nothing is opened up
[1:01:46] everything stays on the cover everything
[1:01:48] stays covered up and of course you know
[1:01:50] then then all those that are uh
[1:01:53] controlling in power and take over and
[1:01:56] uh lord of you all their deeds are just
[1:01:58] they're they're
[1:01:59] they're uh they're uh uncoverable
[1:02:02] they're in darkness
[1:02:03] men rather have darkness than light
[1:02:07] i'll be honest with you i i not that i
[1:02:09] would lie to you but
[1:02:11] it's a figure of speech probably
[1:02:12] shouldn't say that but anyway
[1:02:14] um i was i was praying the other morning
[1:02:19] and and a thought come to me
[1:02:22] about what this country's been going
[1:02:25] through and how it's evolved
[1:02:27] and and i went back in my mind maybe as
[1:02:29] far as ronald reagan
[1:02:30] and presidency because you know the
[1:02:32] presidency has con
[1:02:33] has control of the basically the free
[1:02:35] world really i mean
[1:02:36] he's the leader of the free world they
[1:02:38] say but uh and i thought about
[1:02:40] going through that i was just a kid and
[1:02:43] then where hw
[1:02:44] came and clinton came and and you know
[1:02:47] come up to this time and
[1:02:48] and then bush and obama uh and i
[1:02:51] and i thought as i looked at it it
[1:02:54] seemed like to me
[1:02:56] republican or democrat you're part of
[1:02:58] the deep state it doesn't matter
[1:03:00] if you're part of the ruling class if
[1:03:02] you're part of the elite if you're a
[1:03:03] part of that
[1:03:04] swamp as forgive me but trump called the
[1:03:06] swamp
[1:03:07] if you're part of that it doesn't matter
[1:03:10] brother graham said it's rotten to the
[1:03:11] core so
[1:03:12] republican democrat doesn't matter right
[1:03:14] it doesn't matter
[1:03:15] oh it's right right so i thought as
[1:03:18] as as you saw it coming republican
[1:03:20] democrat democrat republican all the way
[1:03:22] and i thought and then it come up to
[1:03:24] about four years ago
[1:03:26] and and and not that donald trump was
[1:03:29] some great man or anything we know he
[1:03:31] had the morals of an alley cat when
[1:03:33] when people elected him they weren't i
[1:03:35] don't think people elected him because
[1:03:37] of that
[1:03:38] uh i think they elect him because uh he
[1:03:39] was a popular man people knew him he had
[1:03:41] a name
[1:03:42] and he was a successful businessman and
[1:03:44] they thought well if anybody can turn it
[1:03:46] around
[1:03:47] it can be him right anyway uh
[1:03:51] but then it but then it it it went from
[1:03:53] there
[1:03:55] to a place to where the man began to
[1:03:56] call himself a non-denominational
[1:03:58] christian and we've never had a
[1:04:00] president call himself a non-today
[1:04:02] non-denominational christian not
[1:04:03] publicly anyway
[1:04:05] and and as i thought lord again i was
[1:04:08] praying and i thought lord
[1:04:09] why why then now if we've gone back to
[1:04:12] this
[1:04:15] why then wha was he even elected
[1:04:19] why why did you allow because again god
[1:04:22] puts them up god takes it down
[1:04:24] so if he's in there just trust that's
[1:04:26] god's will
[1:04:27] right is he by the scripture so i
[1:04:29] thought why then
[1:04:30] did did you even bring that that little
[1:04:33] respite where
[1:04:34] uh people were prosperous again and
[1:04:36] there was jobs again and there was more
[1:04:38] security and
[1:04:39] you didn't look on the news every night
[1:04:41] and see isis chopping off another
[1:04:43] human's head
[1:04:44] or americans headers and all that went
[1:04:46] away
[1:04:48] and i thought you know the success of
[1:04:50] those things and
[1:04:52] and and and and israel and
[1:04:55] you know we honored israel and we were
[1:04:57] good friends with them and and all the
[1:04:59] things that went along
[1:05:00] why was that four years because
[1:05:01] everything now is just going
[1:05:03] right back to where it was and i thought
[1:05:05] why why was that put in there
[1:05:08] why lord did you interject that and i
[1:05:10] really cause i really didn't know i said
[1:05:12] why
[1:05:12] why was trump even elected why did you
[1:05:15] just keep rolling down the way it was
[1:05:17] going
[1:05:18] the next morning in prayer i think god
[1:05:21] showed me which brought me to this
[1:05:22] scripture
[1:05:24] because what happened during those four
[1:05:26] years one of the
[1:05:27] one of the most prominent things in my
[1:05:29] opinion happened during those four years
[1:05:32] was that a lot of the deeds and a lot of
[1:05:35] the misdoings
[1:05:36] and a lot of the corruption and a lot of
[1:05:38] the darkness
[1:05:40] that was in all of them controlling all
[1:05:42] of that got exposed
[1:05:44] right it's it's things that you
[1:05:47] knew was there but you kind of ignored
[1:05:49] it and it was just kind of under the
[1:05:50] uh under the radar and you knew people
[1:05:53] were crooked you knew they were bad you
[1:05:54] know
[1:05:55] all this you know and you just kind of
[1:05:56] you know as long as my four
[1:05:58] no more and we're good and we're just
[1:05:59] going to keep on trucking and
[1:06:01] whatever they do but they're but but in
[1:06:04] the meantime they're destroying other
[1:06:06] people's lives
[1:06:07] right uh they're ripping jobs from
[1:06:09] people destroying their lives i thought
[1:06:11] as long as people just keep going and he
[1:06:13] knew it was there but now all this came
[1:06:15] to the forefront
[1:06:17] light got shone on a lot of the corrupt
[1:06:21] evil deeds that these people were doing
[1:06:23] right and this man is not a politician
[1:06:26] he wasn't in there because he wanted to
[1:06:28] be popular or because he wanted
[1:06:30] obviously he wants to be popular because
[1:06:32] you won't be president if you're not
[1:06:33] popular people have to vote for you
[1:06:35] but uh money i mean he was he's a
[1:06:38] billionaire he didn't care about the
[1:06:39] money he didn't care about whether he
[1:06:40] had some political career after this or
[1:06:43] was going to make a career out of being
[1:06:44] a politician or something
[1:06:46] so you know with the heart of the people
[1:06:49] want to create jobs and want to do some
[1:06:50] what's
[1:06:51] best for americans and keep americans
[1:06:53] safe and those things
[1:06:54] then uh that's just kind of what he did
[1:06:57] a lot of people didn't like his tweets
[1:06:59] as several of them i wasn't proud of but
[1:07:02] anyway
[1:07:02] again the man he was just just he's just
[1:07:05] a man you know
[1:07:06] just a secular human but i thought but
[1:07:08] what he did was that he took
[1:07:10] and and pulled the cover back from a lot
[1:07:14] of
[1:07:15] all of the evil stuff that's going on
[1:07:17] the things that we didn't know
[1:07:19] deep rooted even in our uh our
[1:07:22] american institutions like fbi
[1:07:26] uh the cia uh
[1:07:30] even congress the media of course
[1:07:34] and social media oh my goodness if
[1:07:36] anybody got exposed in the last four
[1:07:38] years it was how
[1:07:39] biased and dark the media and social
[1:07:41] media is i mean they're just absolutely
[1:07:43] corrupt yes that's right this
[1:07:44] absolutely dark gross dark
[1:07:48] uh can't see the hand dark
[1:07:51] yes uh all that come exposed
[1:07:55] people it wasn't so much so that way
[1:07:59] four years ago when all this was coming
[1:08:01] but then when all
[1:08:02] these things began to infiltrate through
[1:08:04] here you thought why that's that's wrong
[1:08:06] that's wrong that's wicked that's evil
[1:08:09] that's
[1:08:10] bad and and the number and the sheer
[1:08:13] volume of of the institutions and
[1:08:17] people that are deep rooted in these
[1:08:19] institutions they're just
[1:08:20] absolutely wicked people they're just
[1:08:23] they're just evil
[1:08:24] which highlights our understanding of
[1:08:28] this
[1:08:28] for 60 70 years because the prophet told
[1:08:31] us it was rotting to the core
[1:08:33] right and as my dad used to say and the
[1:08:35] core is rotten too
[1:08:38] but what did brother branham tell us
[1:08:39] happened to the core of the apple
[1:08:42] wasn't that woodpecker pecking on it
[1:08:44] like the socialist communists and all
[1:08:46] that stuff he said what destroyed
[1:08:47] america was the
[1:08:48] the worm in the middle of the apple that
[1:08:51] ate the core of the apple
[1:08:53] the the morals the ethics the the the
[1:08:56] rightness of the countries morals that
[1:08:58] had decayed
[1:08:59] this country into what it was and what
[1:09:01] it is
[1:09:02] and become so drug dependent this nation
[1:09:05] is so drug-dependent friend
[1:09:07] that you can't stop the flow of illegal
[1:09:09] drugs coming into this country
[1:09:11] there's too many people in power and too
[1:09:14] much money to be had
[1:09:16] it's wicked evil
[1:09:20] killing our unborn children by the
[1:09:22] millions
[1:09:23] you know what happens you know what
[1:09:25] biblically happens to a nation that
[1:09:26] destroys their children
[1:09:28] god destroys them brother adam saw this
[1:09:31] nation burnt
[1:09:31] border border coast to coast yes how's
[1:09:34] it going to have i don't know
[1:09:35] right but it wouldn't take much no this
[1:09:38] this country sitting on a powder cake
[1:09:40] friend
[1:09:40] all it takes is a little rumble of
[1:09:41] california maybe go under a little
[1:09:43] earthquake over in yellowstone with that
[1:09:45] super volcano and this place is history
[1:09:49] yes border border coast to coast it will
[1:09:51] happen
[1:09:52] yes amen i don't believe i'll be here to
[1:09:54] see it but it will happen
[1:09:57] amen that because it's gotten to that
[1:09:59] place god is taking over that darkness
[1:10:02] is coming in i remember years ago i
[1:10:06] don't know if it's still the same but
[1:10:07] years ago
[1:10:08] seattle used to be a place people did
[1:10:10] not want to live
[1:10:11] because it was so cloudy and dreary all
[1:10:14] the time
[1:10:16] the suicide rate in seattle was so high
[1:10:19] that it was at alarming rates but it was
[1:10:22] like that because of the climate
[1:10:24] it's it's cloudy i hear it's cloudy
[1:10:27] overcast
[1:10:28] no sun for 80 of the year
[1:10:31] and you think about moving from here to
[1:10:33] there my we're like 90
[1:10:35] sun uh we're like tops in the country
[1:10:39] for the amount of sun we get in a year
[1:10:41] even though florida calls themselves the
[1:10:42] sunshine state we actually get more sun
[1:10:45] here more days of sun in arizona
[1:10:48] than anywhere in the country but in
[1:10:50] seattle people used to kill themselves
[1:10:52] because it's a mindset people go up
[1:10:55] there and all the darkness and the
[1:10:57] dreary and
[1:10:58] and the weight of all that on people and
[1:11:00] and they were committing suicide by
[1:11:02] warming rates i don't know if it's still
[1:11:04] the same because
[1:11:05] people have flocked to seattle now have
[1:11:08] they become so
[1:11:09] used to the dark have they become so
[1:11:13] used to the dreary the weary the the
[1:11:16] darkness that it really just doesn't
[1:11:18] matter anymore
[1:11:19] right i hear now people are committing
[1:11:22] suicide
[1:11:23] now you got to be i say this because you
[1:11:26] got to be in a very dark place to commit
[1:11:28] suicide in my opinion
[1:11:30] so but i hear now that people are
[1:11:32] committing suicide at alarming rates
[1:11:34] because they're being cooped up all the
[1:11:36] time
[1:11:37] they can't get out they can't go do what
[1:11:39] they want they can't eat their favorite
[1:11:41] restaurant they don't have a job they've
[1:11:42] lost all their money they've
[1:11:44] lost their living it looks like a person
[1:11:46] that's been a waitress all her life
[1:11:48] isn't ever going to be a waitress again
[1:11:50] or things like that or cook or own a
[1:11:51] restaurant or
[1:11:53] or airline industry in those things i
[1:11:55] mean they're just
[1:11:56] absolutely wanting to destroy those
[1:11:58] industries
[1:11:59] what they're doing is keeping control
[1:12:02] over people
[1:12:03] darkness is darkness and people are

[1:12:11] i'm i'm just going to give them the
[1:12:13] benefit of doubt i'm going to say

[1:12:16] people
[1:12:18] don't ask me if i truly believe that but
[1:12:20] i'm going to put that on tape
[1:12:22] that actually on tv are saying that if
[1:12:25] you supported donald trump you need to
[1:12:27] be deprogrammed
[1:12:29] we need to deprogram those people like
[1:12:32] i'm a malfunctioning robot or something
[1:12:35] right you need to be if you're a
[1:12:37] conservative if you're and you know
[1:12:39] where they're headed with this
[1:12:41] they're not headed necessarily with
[1:12:42] people that supported donald trump
[1:12:44] they're headed for you
[1:12:45] right yeah they're headed for christians
[1:12:47] bible-believing christians
[1:12:49] right amen i don't drink at starbucks
[1:12:54] and and it's i don't like coffee but
[1:12:57] anyway
[1:12:58] and if you do that's perfectly fine but
[1:13:01] i never went a lot
[1:13:02] anyway but when i found out the phone

[1:13:08] you're not welcome in my restaurant i
[1:13:10] quit going
[1:13:12] now does it matter whether i go or not
[1:13:14] no

[1:13:18] fine
[1:13:19] and if you you like it and you go that's
[1:13:21] fine
[1:13:22] my sis my daughter loves it and that's
[1:13:24] fine micah got her a gift certificate
[1:13:26] for christmas
[1:13:27] and that's perfectly fine but when i
[1:13:28] heard that it's there's that attack
[1:13:31] see the attack on people that are
[1:13:34] believers christians
[1:13:35] people that believe the bible not just
[1:13:37] go to church and
[1:13:38] and and say oh i'm a christian and live
[1:13:41] however they want
[1:13:42] no a bible-believing christian and a
[1:13:44] bible-believing christian
[1:13:46] truly by revelation is not welcomed in
[1:13:48] this country
[1:13:49] not welcomed in this world anymore this
[1:13:52] bride is being squeezed out to where god
[1:13:56] is making her like him
[1:13:58] to come home to be with him right amen
[1:14:00] so
[1:14:01] god will just take her home instead of
[1:14:03] the people because this has happened
[1:14:04] before
[1:14:05] right this is not noon happened in
[1:14:07] israel in egypt
[1:14:08] when when egypt encompassed the children
[1:14:11] of israel because there arose up a
[1:14:12] pharaoh who knew not joseph
[1:14:15] right but if we got today anyway there
[1:14:18] rose up a pharaoh who knew not joseph
[1:14:20] and what he do he
[1:14:21] put them in chains and and made them
[1:14:24] serve with rigor and hard bondage as
[1:14:26] slaves
[1:14:28] he made them serve as slaves but it's
[1:14:31] not going to get to that point today
[1:14:32] because we're at the end
[1:14:34] right it might engulf and close in on
[1:14:36] his friend but before they can clamp
[1:14:38] down on us we're going home
[1:14:39] amen it's time for a rapture for this
[1:14:42] anti-bride yes
[1:14:44] that's the time we live not a time of
[1:14:47] slavery not a time of making everything
[1:14:49] okay and good and people want to make
[1:14:51] this world okay and
[1:14:52] want to make it a better place to live
[1:14:54] that's all fine and good friend but
[1:14:55] that's not
[1:14:56] my calling my calling is to get a bride
[1:14:58] ready to go home to meet jesus
[1:15:01] my calling is for me to get ready to go
[1:15:04] home to be with him
[1:15:05] that's my desire that's where i'm
[1:15:07] focused that's what i'm looking to
[1:15:09] for us to get out of here not move
[1:15:11] forward but move up
[1:15:14] i'm ready to change my residence to
[1:15:16] heaven
[1:15:17] amen what's that one uh one hallelujah
[1:15:20] square whatever it's called that's where
[1:15:22] i want to go
[1:15:23] that's where i want to live
[1:15:26] the light has come notice how gross
[1:15:30] darkness
[1:15:33] covered the people in egypt
[1:15:38] because all the plagues that
[1:15:41] that that hit egypt didn't hit israel
[1:15:44] it hit egypt all the plagues all the
[1:15:46] things that
[1:15:47] that moses that god called down through
[1:15:49] moses that was a judgment on egypt
[1:15:52] wasn't a judgment on israel it was a
[1:15:54] judgment on egypt
[1:15:56] and when egypt received that judgment
[1:15:58] what was the last
[1:16:00] judgment they got and don't tell me that
[1:16:02] this world in this country is not under
[1:16:04] judgment
[1:16:04] right right this country spurned grace
[1:16:08] many many years ago and when you spurn
[1:16:10] grace there's nothing left but judgment
[1:16:13] what was the judgment that egypt was
[1:16:15] under and then what was the last
[1:16:18] judgment gross darkness
[1:16:21] went through the land and caused death
[1:16:25] the death angel came and swept through
[1:16:27] there
[1:16:28] it didn't hurt israel because god had a
[1:16:30] way of escape for her
[1:16:32] but it destroyed and killed everyone the
[1:16:35] firstborn of egypt through the gross
[1:16:36] darkness that came through the land
[1:16:38] and created death now it's not a
[1:16:41] spiritual death
[1:16:43] or a physical death but a spiritual
[1:16:45] death right that's
[1:16:46] grip the people but what does that mean
[1:16:49] for the bride
[1:16:50] that means for the bride that it's time
[1:16:52] for her to arise
[1:16:54] amen for her to shine because thought
[1:16:57] has come amen and the glory of the lord
[1:17:00] is risen upon us
[1:17:02] yes that's our time amen that's our time
[1:17:04] to arise
[1:17:06] to shine to let that word shine through
[1:17:08] us
[1:17:09] it's not a time to be playing church
[1:17:11] it's not a time to be laying down and
[1:17:13] slumbering and sleeping and being lazy
[1:17:15] it's a time to rise and let the glory of
[1:17:18] god come
[1:17:19] and fall upon us and let us rise and
[1:17:21] shine
[1:17:22] amen that let that light that light
[1:17:24] encompass us
[1:17:25] and take over us look what it was uh in
[1:17:28] the in the at the last day
[1:17:31] let's go to uh matthew chapter 25
[1:17:35] i think i marked it out here where i put
[1:17:37] it matthew 25 here we go
[1:17:40] we all know the scripture well
[1:17:43] amen
[1:17:47] arise shine rise means get up
[1:17:51] amen stand up get on your feet amen amen
[1:17:55] show who you are amen let the world see
[1:17:58] you're the
[1:17:58] you're the light of the world today
[1:18:01] god's light is shine upon you and shine
[1:18:03] through you today
[1:18:04] but it's time to rise and shine and let
[1:18:06] that light shine because the darker it
[1:18:08] gets the light
[1:18:09] the brighter the light shines right well
[1:18:12] if it's gross dark
[1:18:14] you could light a match in here you
[1:18:15] could go outside in the sunlight might
[1:18:17] imagine but
[1:18:18] light match wouldn't look like much but
[1:18:19] if you light a match in colossal cave
[1:18:21] when the lights turn off
[1:18:22] it'll illuminate you'd probably see
[1:18:24] everybody in there right yeah you can
[1:18:26] see all around you
[1:18:27] just from a simple stick match yes
[1:18:31] well that's the way this gross darkness
[1:18:33] is friend if you're rising shine
[1:18:35] is showing the rest of the world what's
[1:18:36] going on today true
[1:18:38] amen i want to get you this quote here
[1:18:40] in a minute
[1:18:42] micah's got something i want you to look
[1:18:44] at too now matthew 25 let's read through
[1:18:46] this real quick and we'll get to that
[1:18:48] then shall the kingdom of heaven be like
[1:18:50] another ten virgins which took their
[1:18:51] lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:18:53] bridegroom
[1:18:54] five of them were wise five were foolish
[1:18:57] now this isn't talking about the
[1:18:58] unbeliever this is the
[1:19:00] foolish and the wise and foolish virgin
[1:19:02] right right five of them were wise five
[1:19:03] were foolish and they
[1:19:05] and they they that were foolish took
[1:19:07] their lamps and took no oil with them
[1:19:10] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:19:13] with their lamps so it's not just a
[1:19:15] physical anointing it's an indwelling
[1:19:17] presence of christ
[1:19:19] it's a continually a continual flood of
[1:19:22] that oil
[1:19:23] notice in the in the menorah there was
[1:19:26] that oil that stayed in there
[1:19:28] that that was feeding that lamp all the
[1:19:30] time
[1:19:31] you didn't light it and then when it
[1:19:33] just burnt down it went out
[1:19:35] it always had an oil that kept flowing
[1:19:38] through
[1:19:39] well that's what the wise virgins got
[1:19:40] they got christ
[1:19:42] they got the the holy spirit they become
[1:19:44] born again
[1:19:45] filled with his spirit so that that oil
[1:19:47] continues to work and live through you
[1:19:50] amen not just an anointing that'll hit
[1:19:52] you in church and burn off when you go
[1:19:54] to work
[1:19:54] right right but it's always there
[1:19:58] it's flowing keeping you alive keeping
[1:20:00] you lit
[1:20:01] well the foolish virgin didn't get that
[1:20:03] all they got was a nice spark of the
[1:20:05] anointing and then it and then it just
[1:20:07] fizzled out
[1:20:08] when it fizzled out they uh but let's
[1:20:11] get to this part the wise
[1:20:13] took oil in their vessels with their
[1:20:14] lamps while the bridegroom tarried
[1:20:16] they all slumbered and slept all ten of
[1:20:18] them were asleep they all ted were being
[1:20:20] lazy slumbering sleeping
[1:20:22] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:20:24] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:20:26] to meet him
[1:20:27] all of the virgins arose they were all
[1:20:29] asleep now they all arose
[1:20:31] they all arose and trimmed their lamps
[1:20:35] now if you ever seen a lamp you know
[1:20:37] what trimming lamp means
[1:20:38] if you haven't seen a lamp or lantern
[1:20:41] you may not understand but
[1:20:43] a wick is a is a is a pure element that
[1:20:46] uh a cord or whatever it's made of
[1:20:50] that that will burn fire
[1:20:53] as long as it has something to keep it
[1:20:55] going
[1:20:56] but the fire will actually begin to make
[1:20:59] the wick
[1:21:00] uh all gnarled up and and burnt on the
[1:21:03] end
[1:21:04] um if you've ever seen a lamp that's
[1:21:08] that's a that's a brand new wick the
[1:21:11] the flame burns pure and it's like a
[1:21:14] nice orb to it it's really pretty
[1:21:16] but once you get carbon and all built up
[1:21:18] on the end of that wick
[1:21:20] that that flame will start flickering
[1:21:22] and it'll jump around and part of it
[1:21:23] won't
[1:21:24] be lit and it and it won't give out the
[1:21:26] kind of light it's supposed to
[1:21:28] but if you trim that lamp and you take
[1:21:30] and you trim that carbon off of it you
[1:21:32] get back down to the original
[1:21:34] you get about back down to that that's
[1:21:37] the that's the real part
[1:21:39] and you get rid of all the clutter and
[1:21:42] all the junk that
[1:21:43] that's closing that that's clogging the
[1:21:44] channel it's clogging
[1:21:46] the the communication between you and
[1:21:48] the lord and you get rid of all that
[1:21:50] stuff
[1:21:50] the worldliness the ungodliness whatever
[1:21:52] it is and you trim all that
[1:21:54] off and that lamp just begins to burn
[1:21:56] pure beautiful
[1:21:57] nice orb again so they all trimmed their
[1:22:00] lamps
[1:22:01] they all arose they all trimmed their
[1:22:04] lamps
[1:22:05] and the foolish thing and why give us
[1:22:06] your give us of your oil for our lamps
[1:22:08] are gone out so
[1:22:09] obviously they let their lamps were lit
[1:22:12] at one time
[1:22:13] they were actually on fire for god at
[1:22:16] one time
[1:22:17] but once that anointing faded away once
[1:22:20] that anointing
[1:22:21] burned off once they got out from under
[1:22:23] it they didn't have anything
[1:22:26] they were they were living with the same
[1:22:27] old devil nature they were when they
[1:22:29] were born
[1:22:31] but when you're born again and that
[1:22:34] continual oil keeps burning
[1:22:36] then it never goes out it continues to
[1:22:39] burn and will keep burning
[1:22:40] it'll never go out but the wise answer
[1:22:43] is saying not so lest there be not
[1:22:45] enough for us
[1:22:45] in you but go you rather than that sell
[1:22:47] and buy for yourselves brother graham
[1:22:48] said watch
[1:22:50] for those that go those nominations
[1:22:51] those nominational people start trying
[1:22:53] to go after that oil watch
[1:22:55] that's that's the time the bridegroom
[1:22:56] comes amen
[1:22:59] yeah and they're absolutely doing it
[1:23:00] yeah right absolute now
[1:23:02] they think they got these prophecies and
[1:23:04] gifts and all these things that they
[1:23:05] made your own friend
[1:23:06] but the light has not come to illuminate
[1:23:08] your gift the light has come to
[1:23:10] illuminate the word
[1:23:12] and to illuminate the word to you so
[1:23:14] that it becomes a revelation to you
[1:23:15] and when it becomes a revelation to you
[1:23:17] you become like the word
[1:23:19] you become the word and you live what
[1:23:21] the word is amen
[1:23:23] because you are the word at that point
[1:23:24] yes you are the word at that point
[1:23:27] amen is that okay to say you are at that
[1:23:30] point you
[1:23:30] are the word amen and that word
[1:23:33] illuminates through you it's shiny
[1:23:36] because you've risen you've shook off
[1:23:38] all the other skin it's not a time to be
[1:23:40] playing churchman
[1:23:41] shake all that other off and let that
[1:23:43] light shine
[1:23:45] as you've arisen let it shine through
[1:23:47] you today
[1:23:49] amen when they went to buy the
[1:23:51] bridegroom came
[1:23:52] they were ready went in with and they
[1:23:53] that were ready when went in with him to
[1:23:56] the marriage and the door was shut
[1:23:58] afterward came also the other virgin
[1:23:59] saying lord lord open to us
[1:24:01] but he answered said verily i say unto
[1:24:03] you i know you not in other words
[1:24:05] he's not saying i never knew you or you
[1:24:07] were never part of me he's saying i'm
[1:24:09] ignoring you
[1:24:10] yeah that's if you look it up you'll see
[1:24:12] that word no
[1:24:13] means that he's i'm i'm turning my back
[1:24:15] i'm ignoring you
[1:24:16] because they didn't get what they were
[1:24:18] supposed to get when they had the time
[1:24:19] and chance to get it
[1:24:21] amen that's why the so valuable
[1:24:23] important to understand
[1:24:24] being born again amen amen
[1:24:28] i know you're not watch therefore for
[1:24:30] you know neither the day nor the hour
[1:24:32] when the son of man cometh
[1:24:34] now these foolish that the all the
[1:24:37] virgins arose
[1:24:38] but the foolish didn't have enough oil
[1:24:40] or if the oil
[1:24:41] in the right place now it's all the same
[1:24:44] and brother abraham said it's all the
[1:24:45] same anointing it's the same holy spirit
[1:24:48] the people in the denominations or
[1:24:50] wherever they get under that anointing
[1:24:51] they stand and say praise the lord
[1:24:53] what a brother man talk about the terror
[1:24:54] and the and the wheat they both the rain
[1:24:56] coming they both stand and praise the
[1:24:58] lord the week stands up praise the lord
[1:25:00] tara says praise the lord i got the
[1:25:02] water the others stand out here praise
[1:25:04] the lord
[1:25:05] but then when all that anointing's gone
[1:25:06] where are they
[1:25:09] amen that's right the bride is the one
[1:25:12] that's standing on the word because that
[1:25:14] oil continues to feed
[1:25:16] and and lubricate and keep that person
[1:25:19] shining
[1:25:20] amen keep them shining from the soul
[1:25:23] from the inside out
[1:25:24] person other just got an anointing on
[1:25:26] the flesh or spirit or something
[1:25:27] and that's all they had was just a
[1:25:29] simple anointing but it went out
[1:25:32] but now those that had their lamps their
[1:25:33] vessels continuing to burn
[1:25:36] are showing and shining because they
[1:25:39] arose
[1:25:40] that's what it said when when when they
[1:25:42] were shaking at midnight
[1:25:44] and remember the bible says everything
[1:25:46] that can be shaken will be shaken
[1:25:48] when they were shaken at midnight they
[1:25:50] stood to their feet
[1:25:52] they rose up they shook themselves and
[1:25:54] they began to shine because their light
[1:25:57] had oil on it they trimmed their lamps
[1:25:59] and their light was shining bright and
[1:26:00] beautiful because that's the way it's
[1:26:01] supposed to do
[1:26:03] amen look at this last day if michael
[1:26:05] put that up
[1:26:07] for me here i'll read you a quote
[1:26:13] i'll read you the quota she's got we've
[1:26:14] seen this before many times
[1:26:17] it's in the church age book but i want
[1:26:19] you to see it i thought this would be a
[1:26:20] little bit better maybe than me trying
[1:26:22] to draw those on a board again
[1:26:24] believe it or not those dark circles are
[1:26:26] hard to draw on a board with a
[1:26:28] dry erase question you mark on it when
[1:26:31] you mark back over it you erase part of
[1:26:32] what you put on there the first time
[1:26:34] it just doesn't look right but now look
[1:26:37] at this i'm going to read this
[1:26:39] he said then we see before the seven
[1:26:41] seals that hit all the mysteries that
[1:26:43] hid
[1:26:43] all the mysteries me not knowing what i
[1:26:46] was drawing on the board for the church
[1:26:48] ages i never
[1:26:49] god knows just by vision
[1:26:52] this is what brother brown says now you
[1:26:54] gotta you gotta listen to what he's
[1:26:55] saying he said he drew this
[1:26:57] by vision so that means this wasn't just
[1:27:00] something that was
[1:27:01] uh you know in brother branham's mind or
[1:27:04] something this was something he did by a
[1:27:06] vision
[1:27:06] god showed it to him right he said by
[1:27:09] vision i draw it
[1:27:10] not knowing that god a year and six
[1:27:12] months later was going to vindicate it
[1:27:14] in the skies
[1:27:15] by the moon and slip it across the
[1:27:17] national papers i did not know that
[1:27:20] i didn't know there would be a
[1:27:22] mysterious blackout in the moon to
[1:27:24] represent this
[1:27:25] laodicean age now look what he's talking
[1:27:28] about
[1:27:28] with the laodicean age we know is the
[1:27:30] last one
[1:27:32] sorry we got two tvs i can't do both of
[1:27:34] you but you see the loud to see it on
[1:27:36] the very end
[1:27:37] okay you got darkness increasing
[1:27:41] and going up to the part that we got to
[1:27:43] the philadelphia age just after the dark
[1:27:45] ages
[1:27:46] where the light began to shine a little
[1:27:48] more under the reformation
[1:27:50] and and wesley and the philadelphian age
[1:27:52] and the open door and the door of
[1:27:53] evangelism and missionary work
[1:27:55] that open door was missionary work sorry
[1:27:57] i'm probably right in your face aren't
[1:27:58] they uh
[1:28:00] streaming uh a missionary age and sorry
[1:28:03] you can't see this but
[1:28:04] uh anyway but then you notice in
[1:28:06] laodicea
[1:28:08] how brother brown drew that elead
[1:28:11] it ebbed back away from light
[1:28:16] you notice it was mostly light in the
[1:28:18] first church age
[1:28:20] and then it was ebbed ever so much each
[1:28:23] age
[1:28:24] into more and more darkness and then in
[1:28:27] the reformation
[1:28:28] time philadelphia age open door it began
[1:28:31] to bring back a little light again
[1:28:33] right remember we talked about that a
[1:28:35] couple of weeks ago
[1:28:36] with the the with the uh enlightenment
[1:28:39] time and understanding the difference
[1:28:42] between enlightenment
[1:28:43] and and um uh the the development of
[1:28:46] science and reason and
[1:28:48] and those things and and those things
[1:28:51] have their place
[1:28:52] but not with faith and with science and
[1:28:55] region but now this enlightenment
[1:28:58] is is bringing light because of the
[1:29:01] gospel that was being preached the
[1:29:03] gospel that was going forth
[1:29:05] the printing of the gutenberg press it
[1:29:07] was printing of the bible people got the
[1:29:08] bible in their hands they could read the
[1:29:10] bible god could
[1:29:11] uh deal with those people you notice in
[1:29:13] the dark ages the light
[1:29:15] almost completely out right but god
[1:29:18] instructed brother branham to draw that
[1:29:20] the way he did
[1:29:22] because it was still bright even during
[1:29:24] the dark ages
[1:29:25] right still bright still there at that
[1:29:28] time
[1:29:28] but now he says in the lao the sin age
[1:29:32] the mysterious blackout of the moon
[1:29:35] the laodicean age that's the day that
[1:29:38] we're living today
[1:29:39] yes now we're not a part of the layout
[1:29:41] to see an age we feel the effects of it
[1:29:43] yes but this bride has moved into a
[1:29:45] bright age
[1:29:46] amen she's in a different place now
[1:29:48] she's in a we live here
[1:29:50] and we feel the effects of that spirit
[1:29:52] and of this age but we're not of this
[1:29:54] world
[1:29:55] we're not of this age we're pilgrims and
[1:29:57] strangers
[1:29:58] amen we're part of a bride age now
[1:30:00] that's come out of laodicea
[1:30:03] but laodicea is still here and the
[1:30:04] effects of leo the seal still here
[1:30:06] now he says now on the papers he says
[1:30:10] you only get the six ages
[1:30:12] in the newspapers where the moon showed
[1:30:15] it he said you only get six of them
[1:30:17] there
[1:30:18] he said is because the laodicean church
[1:30:22] was blacked out completely right
[1:30:25] yes my friend now he's not talking about
[1:30:29] the president he's not talking about the
[1:30:30] government he's not talking about
[1:30:32] politics or economics or he's talking
[1:30:34] about the
[1:30:35] church yes the loud to see a church
[1:30:39] of which god they put god
[1:30:42] on the outside and you see him at the
[1:30:45] end of revelation 3
[1:30:47] knocking to get into his own church
[1:30:50] blacked out they don't want god anymore
[1:30:54] they don't want the bible anymore they
[1:30:56] don't want the bible they don't want god
[1:30:58] if they don't want the bible friend they
[1:31:00] don't want me that's right
[1:31:02] they don't want god they don't want me
[1:31:03] they don't want the bible they don't
[1:31:04] want me they don't want god because they
[1:31:06] don't want the bible anymore
[1:31:07] they want a seminary or some kind of
[1:31:09] doctrine or something that that follows
[1:31:11] along with their fancy
[1:31:12] they want to trans uh translate this
[1:31:15] true
[1:31:16] bible into so many different
[1:31:18] translations
[1:31:19] that it barely resembles what it's
[1:31:20] supposed to say right
[1:31:22] oh we'll see what this says here and and
[1:31:24] you read this uh so
[1:31:26] that has that that doesn't even have a a
[1:31:29] mirror of what it's supposed to say in
[1:31:31] the original context
[1:31:33] right but they translate it so much how
[1:31:35] many translations of the bottle there
[1:31:36] are now
[1:31:37] right probably thousands of different
[1:31:38] translations they're going to translate
[1:31:40] it so far down and say hey dude how
[1:31:42] y'all doing today
[1:31:43] right yeah right that's what the bible's
[1:31:45] going to end up saying to those people
[1:31:47] oh you all right it's good the see the
[1:31:50] woman caught in the act she was
[1:31:52] she was dope whatever i don't know what
[1:31:54] that means
[1:31:55] i've heard it before i mean that's how
[1:31:59] mentally ill and how badly this has
[1:32:03] gotten yeah right
[1:32:04] well it's supposed to be laodicea was
[1:32:06] completely blacked out
[1:32:08] right no light at all
[1:32:12] and friend shall i say it is dark
[1:32:15] yes it is completely black laodicea is
[1:32:19] completely black
[1:32:21] you see i've said this many times
[1:32:24] they'll just see it
[1:32:25] completely blacked out and if you would
[1:32:27] notice the spiritual application as god
[1:32:29] said it in the heaven
[1:32:30] when i said it here on earth i left a
[1:32:33] little
[1:32:34] bitty space as you see just a teeny
[1:32:38] little bit of light
[1:32:39] that was just before the very elected
[1:32:43] just the elected was to be called from
[1:32:46] the earth
[1:32:47] amen he said that's why i put that in
[1:32:50] there
[1:32:51] was to be called from the earth he said
[1:32:53] the reason i placed it on there
[1:32:55] for that seventh age that little bit of
[1:32:58] light
[1:32:59] he called it little bitty a bit of light
[1:33:02] teeny little bit of light he said he put
[1:33:04] that for the bride
[1:33:06] but then when he comes to tell about
[1:33:09] this
[1:33:10] alive and remain end-time bride group
[1:33:14] he says you are in the bright age
[1:33:18] uh i i i call you my wife
[1:33:22] now that's a different trans
[1:33:25] transforming from one office to the
[1:33:28] other
[1:33:29] from one position to the other it's no
[1:33:32] longer laodicea
[1:33:35] laodicea is completely black
[1:33:38] but this bride is the only light that
[1:33:41] there is
[1:33:42] in this world today the only light there
[1:33:45] used to be others
[1:33:46] things that shine forth a little bit but
[1:33:48] the only bride that's like the only
[1:33:50] light of this last day is the bride
[1:33:52] yeah he put that little bit of light in
[1:33:54] there he said for that
[1:33:55] end time bride that end time that would
[1:33:58] represent the very elected
[1:34:00] amen the very elected at that end time
[1:34:03] yes
[1:34:04] but we live this bride is is gone beyond
[1:34:08] and above laodicea
[1:34:11] we feel the effects of it we still live
[1:34:13] here but we're not a part of it
[1:34:14] right amen we're in the world but not of
[1:34:17] the world
[1:34:18] that's right amen amen oh that little
[1:34:20] bit of light that's there
[1:34:21] that's her that's us that's you but but
[1:34:23] literally brother adam said when god put
[1:34:26] it in the heavens when god put it in the
[1:34:28] heavens
[1:34:28] he blacked number seven out completely
[1:34:32] completely so that should represent or
[1:34:35] show us
[1:34:36] where we're living today right where are
[1:34:39] we
[1:34:39] we're living in a place we're living in
[1:34:41] a world living in a country
[1:34:43] completely black gross darkness
[1:34:47] devoid mostly of any kind of principles
[1:34:51] and morals
[1:34:52] right yes if there's any to be left
[1:34:54] there's a maggie here
[1:34:56] or a uh or a leah there or
[1:35:00] you know our families or someone there
[1:35:01] may be one here one there
[1:35:04] i mean brother branham talked about
[1:35:06] gleaning time 60 years ago
[1:35:08] gleaning back then now that doesn't stop
[1:35:11] what we do
[1:35:12] i guarantee it won't stop brother tom
[1:35:13] from talking to people at the gym show
[1:35:15] about the lord
[1:35:16] i guarantee you that i know him well
[1:35:18] enough i believe that
[1:35:20] it won't stop me i don't believe it will
[1:35:21] stop you we still do what we're supposed
[1:35:23] to do
[1:35:24] but we understand where we're living we
[1:35:26] understand what's going on today and how
[1:35:28] close we are to getting out of this
[1:35:30] place
[1:35:31] with the things that god is doing god
[1:35:33] has shown light
[1:35:34] and it's been proven that we can see by
[1:35:37] national
[1:35:38] relevance media social media government
[1:35:41] everything that it's completely black
[1:35:43] right and their deeds have been exposed

[1:40:52] the light that all men through him might
[1:40:55] believe
[1:40:56] he was not that light but was sent to
[1:40:59] bear witness of that life
[1:41:01] that was the true light which every man
[1:41:04] which light of every man that cometh
[1:41:06] into the world
[1:41:07] that true life why did that prophet why
[1:41:10] did god
[1:41:11] send him for this last day to forerun
[1:41:15] the second coming of christ to bring
[1:41:18] light
[1:41:18] amen right to take this word
[1:41:21] to bring a revelation of that word to a
[1:41:24] people
[1:41:25] so that that light through him revealing

[1:41:28] would illuminate a whole group of people
[1:41:31] yes
[1:41:32] a group as in millions around the world
[1:41:36] you played millions yeah when brother
[1:41:40] brown went on the other side
[1:41:41] he looked around he said those are your
[1:41:43] people he said my i didn't have that
[1:41:45] many branhams he said no these are your
[1:41:46] converts
[1:41:47] yes he said i look there's millions
[1:41:50] billions
[1:41:51] you know who was there me amen
[1:41:56] you praise the lord i believe that yeah
[1:41:59] you were there you are there amen
[1:42:02] by faith we believe god has already put
[1:42:04] us there
[1:42:05] time to shine friend it's time for us to
[1:42:08] come forth and shine
[1:42:10] god divided look in the beginning god
[1:42:12] said in the beginning uh of
[1:42:14] or genesis 1.
[1:42:19] let's read it i'm going to close with
[1:42:21] this
[1:42:23] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:42:24] and the earth the earth was without form
[1:42:27] and void and darkness
[1:42:28] was upon the face of the deep it was a
[1:42:30] mess
[1:42:31] the spirit of god moved upon the face of
[1:42:34] the waters and what did the spirit of
[1:42:35] god do it said let there be light and
[1:42:37] there was light
[1:42:39] amen maybe my spirit of god came forth
[1:42:41] and it was light
[1:42:43] he said let there be light that was
[1:42:44] light he is light remember in that new
[1:42:47] city of new jerusalem
[1:42:48] only light will have is christ right the
[1:42:50] lamb is the light
[1:42:51] that's right amen he come forth and
[1:42:53] there was light and god saw the light
[1:42:55] that it was good
[1:42:56] and god did what he divided the light
[1:43:00] from the darkness amen
[1:43:03] because when light comes forth darkness
[1:43:05] has to scatter
[1:43:07] so god divided the light and the
[1:43:09] darkness
[1:43:10] so the darkness and the light had no
[1:43:12] fellowship
[1:43:14] we're not one with them we're not a part
[1:43:16] of darkness
[1:43:17] nor is darkness a part of light we're
[1:43:19] not a part of each other god has
[1:43:21] separated the light from the darkness
[1:43:23] amen we were talking to maggie yesterday
[1:43:25] and having our conversation
[1:43:26] and i said god is god has always
[1:43:30] uh made his people peculiar
[1:43:34] by worldly standards make when uh
[1:43:38] israel the jews and abraham he said okay
[1:43:42] uh i want you all to do this and they
[1:43:44] had all these feasts and these new moons
[1:43:46] and he had
[1:43:46] and god had him do this and that and he
[1:43:48] had all these different things and
[1:43:50] traditions and all that they did and
[1:43:52] religious uh
[1:43:53] uh acts and things that god that was
[1:43:55] that god had them do
[1:43:57] i mean i i don't know of any other ones
[1:43:59] it took the
[1:44:00] sacrifices animals and and the things
[1:44:02] that they did and
[1:44:04] and they were peculiar people when they
[1:44:06] were in egypt
[1:44:07] when israel was in egypt they were
[1:44:09] considered a rogue
[1:44:11] group they were a strange people they
[1:44:14] didn't fit in
[1:44:14] in egypt they weren't supposed to fit in
[1:44:17] in egypt
[1:44:18] and just as they didn't fit in in the
[1:44:20] world we don't fit in today
[1:44:22] right we're not supposed to fit in right
[1:44:25] we're of different people

[1:44:29] world god
[1:44:30] called the light from the darkness he
[1:44:33] divided them
[1:44:34] he separated us exposition of the church
[1:44:37] age
[1:44:39] i'll read this he that happened here let
[1:44:41] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:44:42] churches
[1:44:44] how tragic it is that the first age did
[1:44:47] not listen to the spirit
[1:44:49] instead it listened to a man but thank
[1:44:52] god
[1:44:53] in the last age there will be a group do
[1:44:56] what
[1:44:57] rise up amen in this last age there will
[1:45:01] be a group
[1:45:02] rise up the true bride of the last day
[1:45:05] and she will listen to the spirit in the
[1:45:08] day of gross
[1:45:09] darkness the light will return how
[1:45:12] not through prophecy not through gifts
[1:45:15] of the spirit
[1:45:16] speaking in tongues and all that's fine

[1:45:23] that's not what's going to get you in a
[1:45:25] prophecy it's not going to get you in
[1:45:27] the rapture
[1:45:27] having a gift of the spirit's not going
[1:45:29] to get you in the rapture
[1:45:31] it's not even going to get you any
[1:45:32] closer to god right
[1:45:34] amen right amen what does though
[1:45:39] is the darkness will give away
[1:45:42] to a light by the return of the pure
[1:45:45] word amen praise the lord that's it
