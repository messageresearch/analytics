to learn to have the faith to trust you in your word to learn how to live a life that's worthy of the gospel of jesus christ to be kind one to another to be friendly and to love one another in sincerity and in truth and father we're coming down to a point where you have to have complete control yes just like amen yes if you're not lord of all you're not lord at all and lord help us to recognize that you know a time of playing church is over with time of being complacent and lackadaisical in our walk with you it's over with yes lord we need to be more sincere yes i remember when you

is lord to call you our lord to call you our savior to know that you are our lord and our god and lord to serve you and to live for you and to surrender our lives into your hands father and trust in you fully completely because without you lord all of this would mean nothing all of it would be in vain father but god you give us that light you give us that way yes you've shown it lord to us and help us every day not only did you give us your word not only did you show it to us you saved us lord you've given all that we could ever even begin to thank ask you for or thank you for but lord then you just you walk with us every day you live through us you speak to us you give us direction leadership guidance everything that you do for us lord what a privilege it is we thank you god today for this service for these people thank you for this place thank you for those who may be streaming today lord and most of all for you for your word for the revelation of that word for you to speak to us lord once again today and to show us in here what you'd have us to know god to encourage and bless us with help us to draw closer to you father become more like you in this day we're to go forth and bring faith lord to bring healing to bring deliverance to bring salvation to bring whatever we have need of father in this place today this sanctuary that we coming out of the world lord to be with you to worship you and to expect you to meet with us as you have done lord now through the ministering of your word god let it be so speak through these lips the words should have us to hear reveal it to us ministering it to our ears lord every one of us that we receive what you have for us once again we give you thanks and praise and offer it in the name of the lord jesus christ as we pray it to you amen amen saint luke chapter 5 amen we're going to begin with verse 1. amen read through verse 11. it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god my wouldn't that be great today to be pressed upon to hear the word of god sometimes it seems like people run to keep from hearing the word of god amen but the people pressed him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of genezera he saw two ships standing by the lake but uh but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets he entered into the one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people at the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draft simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless that thy word i will let down the net and when he had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their nets break they beckoned unto their partners which were in another ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both ships so that they began to sink when simon peter saw he fell down at jesus knee saying depart from me for i am a sinful man oh lord for he was astonished at all all that were with him at the draft of fish which he had taken and so was also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him so you can be seen and if you'd like praise god my saints i i tell you is i read through the 11 verses of this chapter i feel like there's a dozen messages i can preach right now but we're going to stick with the lord the one i feel like the lord gave us yesterday amen that we're going to take out of the out of the fifth verse amen um i i think it's outstanding in the in the climate that we live in today uh that there are still people who will feel in their hearts the uh the pull the press that these people did on that day when they called to jesus and they pulled on him preach to us the word of god teach to us the word of god we want to hear the word of god we want to know the word of god it seems like things have been so saturated today in the world it's become so common to people today that and and and almost a know-it-all situation or attitude that people think they don't need to be taught anymore they don't need to hear anymore but how many times have you read a scripture and the and the 50th time you read that scripture the lord speaks to you something different than he did the first four times [Music] amen it's just always the same when you listen to a tape you might listen to it a dozen times but that 12th time lord might speak something to you out of that that you never saw before that never showed you before or the 100th time don't know what it is but it's a living word and god's always speaking through it and there's always going to be a people that thirst for that there's always going to be people that have a hunger and a thirst for that word for that pull they want that because that's their sustaining life it's what sustains them spiritually without it they feel like they're going to die if you've been without the word of god for any time of all at all or been in a place of stagnation sometimes it's like that moping stage of the eagle but it gets to that place where you just gotta have that fresh meat you just gotta have that word because it's the only thing that sustains you it's the only thing that keeps you going the only thing that keeps you alive that keeps you viable without it you feel like it's just null and void you want to have a purpose-driven life friend there it is i've never read the book don't know anything about it i understand the premise of it but if you want a purpose-driven life friend that's it without that there is no drive in my life my life has no meaning without that praise the lord but as jesus made preparation that's not going to be my message but as god made preparation uh jesus he goes to simon he says uh take the boat out a little bit so i can preach to him and after the word had gone forth uh the spiritual food had been uh digested had he been ingested it was time to go and get some natural food so jesus told simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought simon answering said unto him now look at now look at the look at peter simon peter's answer master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing amen now jesus gave a command jesus gave his word to peter now what in the word that you found that he may have found her that he may have said before in the old testament or torah whatever it may not have been something that was written down but it was the word of god amen imagine any command to you that comes from god is the word of god to you no matter what it is that word was the word of god it becomes the word of god to us because it's in this canonized bible that we have today this inspired writ that god gave us so it's word to us but to simon peter it was just jesus telling him this was the command this was something jesus was asking peter go do this and peter begin to now look i i know none of us have done this but peter began to make excuse the master we've been out there we've toiled all night long the two ships we've been there we've done this we've been out there and we caught absolutely nothing tired exasperated exhausted because they got no sleep working slaving pulling the nets in out trying to catch fish and peter's in his in his heart he's he's thinking well master lord we've toiled all night long we didn't catch a thing there's nothing out there but then some of the greatest words that he could speak nevertheless lord at your word amen praise the lord nevertheless at your word now i want to speak on uh i just titled this today could have been several titles but uh the sheep of the good shepherd the sheep of the good shepherd because sheep are led we know that sheep are to be led she can't leave themselves and god likens us to sheep god made us like sheep yes he made us to the point that we would have to have a shepherd that we would have to have somebody lead us and that's the thing that today seems to be lost amen seems to be lost in people people want to today lead themselves and the leading of yourself is absolutely contrary to the word of god the only way that you could lead yourself is to get outside of god's word and will to be able to do it if you lead yourself you are out of god's will i don't care who it is am i i don't care who we are i don't care christian non-christian whoever it is i told you the other day we're all born with a soul and that soul is to cry out to god for that uh for that worship even when brother branham talked about he went to the native lands and he would see the the uh they're dancing around and and they're praying and i i believe one time uh he tells a story where they were down praying to their son god or whatever it was and brother branham said stop the car he hopped out and he started praying too and and he got back in the car the brother says maybe maybe it was brother sidney jackson i can't remember anyway he said he said do you know what they were doing he said yeah they were praying to their god and i'm paraphrasing he said but do you know who they were praying to he said i don't he said well this god that god whatever it was but he said i know who i was praying to they're praying to the deity that they know amen and i pray to the deity that i know there's that inherentness in every human born with a soul because that soul wants to live just like the body wants to live to cry out to its maker now some may not understand or know who that maker is sometimes a lot of times the things of life tamp that down and push that down to the place that people's hearts get blackened and darkened sometimes people get caught in cages it reminds me brother ram talked about going to the zoo and he said if i had enough money i'd set him one of them loose because it it just becked his soul but what it did is it reminded him of god's children being caught in cages now he talked about denominational cages but there's a lot more different cages than just the denominational cage now it's the same spirit amen but people call it these cages they're they're bound and they don't even realize it people of the world they think they're free they're not free they're bound in cages right whatever cage it might be a government government cage or whatever it might uh the the situation might be people are they they succumb to these cages where they where they're in that cage and they look at others with scorn uh thinking that that they're the ones people who look at us and think well you're the ones in the cage well i if i am it's jesus's cage and that's the only cage i want to be in so if i'm in a cage it's his cage and i'll stay there praise the lord because he set me free to worship him to serve him but in the world today people want to worship themselves there's actually ministers out there very popular ministries that promote you as your own god you are your own god you know do what feels good to you or what sounds good to you or what makes you happy friend look this may sound bad but i'm not here to be happy i like being happy i enjoy happiness because god makes me happy but i'm not here to be happy i i'm not here to have the best of everything right i'm not here to uh drive the fanciest cars have the biggest house had the most lands had the most i'm not here to live a comfortable life i'm not here to be cushy uh ooey gooey life i'm not here to walk a flowery bed of ease i'm here to serve the lord jesus we forget so many times people forget this is not about us it's about him and our service to him i want this has nothing to do with it well i want to do this well you go right ahead i mean now trust not trust me people will throw well the bible says that he would grant me the desires of my heart yes it will but what if the desire of your heart is like your little son wanted to uh want the car keys or or wanting the razor blade what what if your little girl wants to wants to uh play with scissors or or and don't know how to handle it i mean it's not two conflating things friend for god to grant us to desire our heart and for us to serve him if the desire of my heart is to fall in the will of god god will bless to desire my heart and if our desire of our heart is to serve him and whatever that means then that's what he does yes peter said at thy word lord i want to do whatever you tell me to do you are my shepherd i am a sheep i am to be led you are the good shepherd and the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep he leaves the 90-9 and goes after the one we work so hard and people slaves so hard in this life to make an easier life and there's nothing wrong with that to have a little money to be able to enjoy a home or a a automobile or to live uncomfortably there's nothing wrong with that god bless is in that there's nothing wrong with that but the point is i'm not here to satisfy me if my motives and my objectives and my purposes and what i do and my motives that generate what i do and how i act and where i go and how i speak and what i is for me then i'm wrong it's got to be for him first and foremost my life is for him this is not about me this life is not about you it's not about you having stuff it's not about you being comfortable it's not about you being happy i'm sorry that might sound wrong but it's not now does god give us those things sure he does does god bless us with happiness does he bless us with health does he bless us with families and absolutely he does and we're thankful for that but that's him doing it in my servitude to him it's not about us it's about our service to him amen amen about him and our service to him praise the lord brother ram said here in the message leadership he says we have to be led you know god likened us unto sheep and did you know a sheep can't lead itself he'll wander away stray away he just can't lead himself he has to have somebody to lead him the shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep now that was back in the days of the lord jesus he's the good shepherd that lead the sheep praise the lord and we are the sheep of that good shepherd he laid down his life as micah so wonderfully saved he laid down his life for even me praise the lord that makes him the good shepherd he would leave the 99 and go after me if i went astray you went astray he'd leave all the others and celebrate just like the prodigal son we read last week celebrate greater that the one that had went astray had come back than the 99 that never left well that doesn't seem fair just like the prodigal son's brother he said the same thing well that doesn't seem fair daddy you did all this for him and this for him and he did this this and this he said yeah but your brother was lost and now he's back he's found now he's back home let's celebrate that praise the lord but i never left well but all i got is yours you don't have to worry about that it's not about you amen he had to remind his son it's not about you son it's not the older son it's not about you praise the lord that's so prayful isn't it you want to make everything about us oh there's so many ministries so many voices out there today that want to try to make it all about us not about us it's not about you it's about him who am i praise the lord it's about you how many times how many times dear we lived in places we didn't really want to or do things we didn't really want to go places or what but but it's service to him amen and he blesses it praise the lord and he blesses us in it grants us even the very desires of our hearts so what does it say it's just like peter said at thy word lord see that's obedience at thy word lord not my word at your word lord now sometimes we'll get up about it and say well i don't want to do that well that's your choice you're a free moral legend you can do it and not do it it's your choice but do we want to serve the lord or do we not do we want to make excuses peter make excuses oh lord we've been twirling all night we've we've been out there all night long god and there's nothing out there let's go give it let's go give it another try you know what he did over to in john 21 after his resurrection he's out on the bank and they thought it was him but they weren't sure and he said do you have it in me no we've been twirling all night and we don't have a thing well throw your net on the other side of the boat well what good is that gonna do fish aren't here they aren't here how are they gonna be over here not over here just so you're dead on the other side of the boat that's your word lord threw the net on the other side of the boat and had so many they had to get the whole thing to drag them in couldn't couldn't hardly have enough big enough boat to hold the fish well here he said at thy word and when he said at thy word what did god do he granted the desire of their heart and gave so many fish two bolts were sinking two boats were sinking just because of his obedience just because he did what god told him to do now what happens if peter said you know i i'm done we've already washed our nets we've already cleaned up we're tired as we can be i'm just gonna go home what would have happened amen they had no fish the experience that they have the lesson that they have peter that peter and and jesus this is just an example to you because now you're going to become fishers of men have thy word lord whatever you say lord but look at this he was the good shepherd he is the good shepherd that lead the sheep now this is the rest of this quote but today you see we're living in another day everything is changed and perverted you know what man you know what man has to lead sheep today a goat right who's following the goat amen you know where that goat leads them right into the slaughter now this is pertinent to us i just i feel his presence just coming so strong so i'm going to stop a little bit notice this in in a later scripture as i read it again you know where the goat leads them right into the slaughter what's the goat the goat is a representation of something someone that is not positioned to be in the leadership of a shepherd right amen like like being led by something other than god or some entity other than god or or or uh some other word or some other religion or doctrine or something there's something that leads them and and that leadership is going to send them to the slaughterhouse now there's there's those that god has god has a purpose for everything and there's a reason why people are what they are where they are what they do there's a reason god has goats out there god could take all the goats away if he wanted to amen now i know in the sports world that means the greatest of all time but it doesn't mean that in the spiritual world god has there's goats out there and god allows them to be there because they serve a purpose they do uh it may seem strange but just like god allows the devil to continue to roam and do and this is satan's even because god's got a purpose for that god allows the devil to do that for a reason he's a he's a tool in the hand of god i've said it many times yes we know the devil's nothing more than a tool in the hand of god so god leaves those goats in their positions to lead certain ones astray and it happens that way that they follow them now they're following them based on their free moral agency they can choose to follow them or not follow them right but there is a true shepherd yes and there are true shepherds uh plural the smallest under that great shepherd yes that are to lead into uh into the pastures into green lands into the the purity of and holiness of god there's plenty of goats that lead others to the slaughter but god has those under the good shepherd that lead people into greener pastures amen amen just like psalm 23 said he's he is my shepherd he leadeth me amen a lot of people don't understand they see especially the nomination people they they can quote the psalm 23 but they don't even know what it means the shepherd leadeth me well that's not me that doesn't have anything to do with me that's him leading me right into green pastures and where he wants me to go but god uses those to bring that uh that leading of those sheep about there's goats that lead others into the slaughter they're not of the true shepherd they're not of the good shepherd they're not called to be a shepherd under the good shepherd right amen and god allows that but it's people that just take it upon themselves to do whatever they want to do for whatever reason now we've seen the scripture many times the bible talks about like we read that scripture last week by force or for filthy lucr and things like that for popularity and for money and what all peter tells us that in his writings so we know that there's purpose behind it but but leading goats leading people right into the slaughter look now them little sheep don't know where they're going see because even if it's a sheep a sheep they still have to be led they still don't know they're just following because that's all they know to do where they're going so the gold gloves goes up to the pen up to the slaughter and the sheep don't know no more than to follow a leader so it leads them right up into this slaughter and then the goat jumps over off the track and the sheep just goes right in and gets killed right into the slaughter so the goat was a wrong leader or not ordained called predestined to lead but jesus the good shepherd who led the sheep he led them to life and held their hand but somebody has to lead the sheep amen god leads the sheep now let's go to a different scripture luke chapter 22. when a sheep lives its life all it knows really is just to live the life of a sheep it bears wool because it's his sheep a sheep can't manufacture wool but it can bear wool it can't create wool but it can bear wool but it bears wool because it's a sheep that's all if you're a sheep you bear wool right that's what you do you don't make it you know and that's the dividing line the difference between holiness and living as a holiness a living and and uh being forced to do it uh being made to do it so you can't manufacture it but you can't bear it if you're a sheep you can't manufacture it but you can bear it and that's what she bears that wolf because that's what it's born to do we are born to follow him we are born to bear wolf we are born to follow christ we are born to be led and to be led by god the good shepherd amen the good shepherd luke chapter 22 verse 39 we'll start with 22 39 and he came out and went as he want to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation and as he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing now look this is of course we know very familiar jesus himself jesus himself desiring in his own will that the cup that he was about to face that he wouldn't have to face it i don't want to have to do this i don't want to have to go through this i'm paraphrasing of course but as jesus was here and the flesh as a kinsmen redeemer to us even as the good shepherd became a sheep to be led amen to be led as a father in that position as a as a kinsmen redeemer he couldn't have been a kinsmen redeemer unless he became a sheep himself in a flesh body to be led by the spirit of god by the father that would lead him even in his flesh even in his flesh wanted to have something different happen outside of what the will of god was he said father if thou be willing remove this comfort from me he didn't want to have to do it he wanted his own will to happen even even in james it said if it were up to god up to the will of god if it were if it were up to what he desired we'll say of coupled with our desire that no flesh would be lost and look here he says if thou be willing remove this cup i don't want to have to do this i don't want to have to go through this the agony that that the man part of jesus felt as he was realizing what he was about to go through realizing what was about to happen they said that the the roman crucifixion was to this day the most painful horrible uh uh humiliating death a person could experience was the crucifixion to this day science said that's the most cruel punishment death penalty that has ever been levied the most painful humiliating thing because see when they hung them up there they stripped them down naked yes they hung up there with not a stitch of clothes on them nailed them what they did and putting that board under their under their pelvis so that they they they could sit down a little bit just enough to keep them alive a little bit longer because if they just hung there they would exasperate so much their body would be in such pain that they would just go but they actually put a board under them or they could sit down for a little just kind of lean on it a little bit it actually that board seemed merciful it kept them alive longer so they could be in pain longer it was the most painful cruel death and jesus knew what he was about to go through and of course could you imagine i would have asked god please don't make me have to go through this don't make me have to endure this and so many times we think the things in life would think oh god's just people i've heard people say how cruel god is to allow this little thing to happen i'm like my mind could you just imagine this little this little blip in your life that you're going through and you want to blame god for that and everything he did to save you and to bring you life and we want to complain about a little trial a little blip in our lives oh god help me amen i forgive me lord of my unbelief but the flesh of jesus even desired if you would be willing remove it from me remove it from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done that was the flesh part of jesus crying out to his to the fathers god father for uh uh take this from me but if i have to go through this let it be your will whatever your will is lord whatever your i know people that they don't even like praying for god's will because they're they're afraid what might happen to them seriously people that will they're afraid to pray for god's will because they're afraid of what it might bring in their life they're afraid of what god might do oh my friend when god gave us romans 8 28 it wasn't just for us to uh have a picnic with that that was that was god's word to help us understand that he's making everything whatever it is work for our good amount and he still does he will and this life is just a vapor anyway we're looking we're looking for a greater reward when we leave this place this is not up tops it's not what we want it's what he wants you ever made plans and god stopped them amen absolutely i i remember that time i went to go uh pray for sister heather carpenter and go be with the family ron and carol and family i i i woke up that morning and i looked at the scene i left my hands and said god what can i do for you today and i got up and i think i made coffee or something and prayed and my you know my day and i got in the car because i was driving at the time i got in the car and i went down the road and i got about two miles down the road and god said go to phoenix i said i gotta work today lord things were very very tight uh i i can't give up a day's pay i gotta work he didn't i don't think he said anything else but i knew in my heart i had to go so i just turned the car around and go back got cheese the whole day two days actually amen two days as god's gone up there for two days spent the night up there god bless it amen amen praise the lord did we miss a meal did we miss rent god took care of us amen two days pain loss god takes care of it always does you can't out-give god my daddy always said he is shoveled bigger than mine amen i dig a little light shovel to him and he takes a big old backhoe and a bulldozer and shoves it my way god takes care of us yes amen because we live for him we serve him it's his will that we do not ours that's that's the whole point i want to try to get across more than anything because friend there's that spirit out there in the world today that it's the me first attitude it's the me only attitude is the attitude that'll cut you off in traffic it's the attitude that won't stop at a red light is the attitude that puts their lives and their families above any and everybody else's it's the same attitude and and like i said i've heard preachers propagate this to a point not message but you know uh worldly nominal preachers oh you are your own god people who have influence over who call themselves christians and have influence over large amounts of people i could call names but i'm gonna i'm not going to as it's out in the world i'm not talking about the message just out in the world they say they're christians claim to be christians have influence over millions of people probably and try to propagate propagate to those people you're your own god you call the show you live how you want now i i can see them to that point to the part that god put the word in the bride and the bride will have thus saith the lord or she'll keep still but if she has thus saith the lord she'll speak and if she speaks it will happen amen praise the lord but that's working and operating underneath the auspice of of christ the savior the good shepherd not on my will brother branham wasn't sitting in the woods and said you know what i'm just going to speak squirrels today you know my faith is so strong and so big and and i i just i you know i gotta have a great testimony at church next week i'm going to tell them what a great prophet i am i'm going to go down speak some squirrels squirrel be here he didn't do that that's not how it works he was just there hunting getting along with the lord and god spoke to him what are you here for amen you know the rest of the story that's how it works it doesn't work based on what i want to do what my will or it's what i want to say or for popularity or filthy lucra or something do we do what we do because he's leading us amen not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly as his sweat was as it were the great drops of blood falling down to the ground he when he rose from prayer he come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and he said unto them why sleep he rise and pray unless you enter into temptation amen he had in him in him all in his own self he wanted he had to die to his own will to his own flesh amen we are born let's go to another scripture saint john chapter 10. we're born as humans inherently we're it is inherent in a human to desire to be led by a force greater than us and that's why you see uh politicians the way they are they people look to find somebody that they can follow that that is greater than them a lot of times that greatness today comes whether a person has money or not in the world today that's that's the statute people built upon if they have a lot of money if they're rich you think the money is what makes the rules a person who's rich can call their own shots to do what they want to do and people blindly sometimes follow that but that's not what draws a child of god but it just shows the the nature of a person of a human to desire to follow something that's greater than them just like the ones that brother random that they were praying there to follow someone something that was that's greater than them it's inherent in each one of us now saint john chapter 10 verse 7. amen let me read this quote before i read that scripture it's in christ revealed in his word brother ram tells this story a couple of times but uh this is my favorite christ revealed in his own word he said uh i said you pray wrong we should never pray to change god's mind we should pray to change our mind amen we should pray to change our mind god's mind don't need any changing see that's right i said now uh what do you pray for he said i know a young catholic boy one time he had a prayer book saying some prayers out of the prayer book for his mother to live and she died he throw the prayer book in the fire he said well see brother brahman says i don't go for the prayer book anyhow but he said you take the wrong attitude you're trying to tell god what to do prayers should be lord change me to fit your word not change uh uh let me change your mind but you change my mind that should be our prayer let your that my will become what your will is whatever you would will for me that's what i want to do that's who i want to be that's how i want to pray don't pray god give me this god give me that go god go do here go do there now we have petitions supplications we ask of the lord of course but it's an asking we're ask god lord if you would please we're trusting you and move on this situation amen touch these people heal this person do this miracle lord we're asking if you would and god so many times does for us so many miracles things that we can testify to now let me change your mind you change my mind see you change my mind to your will and your will is written here in this bible amen don't let me go till till you got my mind just set like yours and then when my mind is set like your mind then i'll believe every word that you wrote yes and that is what we follow praise god am i that is how we are led oh that those clothes aren't comfortable i want to wear what i want to wear you go right ahead you'll be walking all over the word of god and transgressing god's word to do it but you go right ahead you're free more ladies you can do what you want come on amen i've had people come even up to my wife years ago i don't know i don't think my wife but or my mother excuse me not my wife years ago so why don't you cut that stringy hair off family members family you know baptists and you know hair is probably shorter than mine but they come and say and i don't mean that as a cynical i'm not trying to be cynical about it this is the truth but why don't you just cut that string your hair off why you have that old long string you're here for isn't that hard to take care of that might be it's not about me that might be uncomfortable it's not about me it's not about my comfort it's not about what's easy or hard for me it's about my obedience to god and his word there's no wallet i'm not going to do that i don't want to wear them and then they make excuse in the word of god this is all well that's not what it says oh that's not what it means and who made you the arbiter of truth to tell me what the word means right amen see that's what we understand about the word of god and one reason just one of the things that brought us to understand this message jesus said if you don't believe me believe the works i do there testify who i am yes brother brown did the same thing if you don't believe me believe what god's doing in my life because it testifies who sent me yes why i'm here not getting one out of a thousand prophecies right that's not god that's right one out of a dozen's not right one out of two's not right right but every single time over a quarter of a million prophecies discernments and and things that god used brother branham to do and not one time ever was it wrong not one time and people call themselves prophets and they get one here and they get one there and you know well we'll just forget about the dozen over here that never happened but what about this one wow i was on the money with that one right well you have insider trader information i don't want to be single about that either friend but it just makes you wonder that's not god there might be some kind of an agabus kind of prophetic gift in someone's life but it becomes such a thing in people's lives that they it puffs them up look at me because i am this one and this one thing out of the thousand i said actually happened every single time amen that's when you know that's where the word and then that's what we say well that that's that's what i follow that's what i believe that's what i look to but the biggest reason is because this message came from this word that's what attracts me the most not the prophecy amen not the gifts the gifts the gifts and all those things we don't major on a minor we know that i don't major on almighty the gifts and all those things those are the discernments so we're fine those were wonderful that attracted people's attention they came in by the droves by the millions never a ministry like it at least not in this day since jesus christ but that's not why i do it i do it because he was on the word that's right amen if you want to get me to believe your prophecy then show me in the word where you stand that's why brother branham would take his bible and say i want one of you to come up here and stand here and show to me in here where i am wrong right right they couldn't do it because they knew where the man is the seventh grade education he'd go to another seminary he didn't learn this from some man that taught him god showed it to him and god does the same even though we followed and believed this message we follow it because of this word we follow it because god has revealed to us this word amen amen that's why we do it now people can say what they want about it but that is the that is the sheep god the shepherd leading the sheep it's this word and christ is the word amen praise the lord he leads us now saint john i think i had to turn saint john chapter 10 uh verse 7 then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture praise the lord i'm the by me we enter in how do we enter in by the door who's the door christ that we find pastor same thing then psalm 23 the thief cometh not but to but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i have come that they might have life and then they might have it more abundantly i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep listen now this goes back to our first quote but he that is in hireling and not the shepherd small s whose own the sheep are not see if the wolf coming and leave at the sheep and fleeteth and the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep that's not a shepherd right that's in hireling you have hirelings well over here brother brown call them goats but a hireling is not someone that cares for the sheep he cares for the money because he's getting paid somebody hired him to do this job those sheep aren't his they don't belong to him he's in a position that he's been hired to be put in and he does not care anything about the sheep so when the wolf comes he just darts away and leads amen when the wolf comes once he gets off the word it changes what brother adam said or he tries to interpret what the word says he leaves he runs because he's inherently he doesn't care about the sheep i've made this statement many times in my opinion and where i see this is the shepherd is the one that is to care for the spiritual welfare of those that uh that are under his care i i had dinner with brother dave fritz the other night and um he was in town and i was talking to him and i made that statement about spiritual welfare and he just said back in easter he said that's that's an outstanding statement i know he's heard me say it before but for some reason it stuck to him this time i said that's exactly right if he's god called if he's got anointed if he's holy ghost field and that's god's position in his life god is responsible to help that man bring the spiritual welfare of that church to the place that is supposed to be in him right and harlan doesn't care right he might can talk before people he might can spat off words he might memorize scripture and you might talk till he's blue in the face but that does not make him a god called anointed pastor right shepherd he's just a harley he's just someone that was put in a position and and don't care for the sheep obviously i don't say anybody in mind of course but that's just the truth you look at these denominational worlds out here today 12 million dollar mansions and stuff where are these people in in the conducting of the the shepherd value over the spiritual welfare of those people when you look at the congregation they look like the rest of the world and they call themselves christians amen how can you how can you even logically look like the rest of the world and still call yourself a christian when there's no differentiation between what you do where you go how you act how you speak how you live what you eat if there's no difference then how do you call yourself a cri then then the heathen's a christian just because they don't go to church on christmas and easter and and celebrate or worship to a song or something that makes them a christian a christian lives a life of a christian because that's pleasing to the lord it's pleasing to god it's what the lord leads us to do and that's why we do it higherly doesn't care a harlem not the shepherd who's on the sheep or not see if the wolf coming you leave it the sheep flee it wolf catches them and scatters the sheep the harling fleet because he is in hirling and carep not for the sheep he's just getting paid that's all he cares about i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so no i the father and i laid down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold of course he had gentiles like us amen that were of the of the jewish sheep where we're different foes amen we're we're a separation of a fold jesus said i come from the lost sheep of the house of israel amen he said here but i have other sheep in another fold amen thank god for that because we belong in that bowl i must bring and they hear my voice and they shall be one fold and one shepherd so there is a time that we all come together as as one together as jesus christ our lord and savior we realized it like brother green used to tell that rabbi he said you know rabbi when when the messiah comes you'll say it's his first coming i'll say it's a second we already know it they will know it and we become one fold praise the lord and one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i laid down my life that i might take it again now if he if the father loves him because of laying down his life you think he loves us because we lay our life down we lay our lives down for one another we lay our lives down for one another we lay our lives down for him amen amen therefore does my father love me because i laid down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father amen and god has given that same power today today so many voices in the land but the sheep know his voice his sheep know his voice amen other sheepdog but his sheep know his voice yes and know that he laid his life down for us and there's so many voices today but there's only one voice of god and that voice speaks to you now it might speak to you a little differently than it speaks to me but it's the same shepherd am i right it's the same god it might show you different things that he shows me won't be unscriptural won't be sinful but it might be a different way that god communicates to you than he communicates with me amen and we're all different that way because god knows us enough enough to know how to get to us and help us know that's god that's god doing that it doesn't have to be a tingle down your spine or the hair stand up on the back of your neck but you know when it's god speaking and when it's god speaking then you obey that because the sheep his sheep know his voice there's so many voices today god look satan has purposely i'm going to close here in just a minute satan has purposely made this world so chaotic and hectic to scramble everything and to make everything so uh confusing to try to disillusion you from from the real voice that we're supposed to hear from that real voice of god that we're supposed to listen to noise and voices coming from all over the place i mean there's people who you don't it doesn't seem like they could exist their heart would stop beating if they didn't have their earbuds stuck in their ear listening to music 24 7. yeah right some people have got to listen to a music or some noise whatever it is every single waking moment of their life yeah and i've seen those people it don't matter where they are what then i love music too i like listening to music but i enjoy my quiet time as much or more than the music times right and speaking to god and let god speak to me when i was running courier service in florida i'd play tapes and as i drove and it didn't happen as much when i was driving here i don't know if it was because i picked up people here when i was doing the uber stuff i was picking up people and it was different when i was running courier was just packages so it was never any other spirit or anything getting in my car it was just packages but it was real prevalent when i was there and i would listen to the listening messages and then all of a sudden it would just come over me i'd turn it off because i knew it was god there i i turn off even the message i turn it off and i rake everything off the passenger side door all right pass your seat have a seat lord let's talk amen that's how i approach it because and that's what that's how dear it was to me but some people you'd think their heart would quit beating if they didn't have those buds in their ear or something music something all the time and satan's made it that way satan has purposely caused it to be so chaotic and hectic in this world and you know it is and it's just gotten worse since i was uh since i've been born since i can remember it's just gotten worse yes and and it's getting worse especially as prices the stuff go up people's worry goes i got to work more i got to put more hours in uh wife's got to go to work whatever it is i got to make this make that and everything becomes so chaotic and everything gets so jumbled it's harder to hear the voice of god and he's trying to keep you from hearing the voice of god but his she we his sheep know his voice when he speaks we know it's him speaking and he's and it's and there's a reason for it because we follow him in humility not prideful humility pride says it's my way price says it's the way i want to do it oh i i know what's better here i i know what i should do over here let's just be led by god and we do that i i and in this congregation saints i believe we all do that and we ask for prayer too we ask the lord and for prayer from one another here when we have things like these situations that come up that we want to bring before the lord and keep those people or keep that situation before the lord and let the lord speak to us with it let him speak to us about it sometimes it's just a matter of him bringing it to pass amen lord touch and heal this person we god we know god hears our prayer because he kills that person i think brother sister julie's back with us today have been not feeling good amen but the lord touched her now she's here we've had prayer for it and god's mindfulness brought our prayers to pass by bringing to pass healing in her body sometimes he speaks to us and gives us direction on something and says go do this or go take this or go eat this or go lay your hand over here whatever it might be and then we try to we try to our best of our abilities not because we we think oh well you know i'm somebody no just what god leads you to do amen and then god and god will prove it because he'll he'll bring it to pass he'll let it happen in the humility amen in the humility now i'm going to read a scripture a lot of us don't want to hear amen but it's in romans chapter 8. we read over it a lot but a lot of times don't really realize what it's telling us romans 8 verse 33 our humility will bring obedience amen i know i do not know better than he does i know amen even though sometimes i might act like it i don't know better than he does a lot first uh what did we say 33 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify it praise the lord who is he that condemneth it is christ that died gay rather that it is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who else who also make an intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword you mean we might actually face all of these things in our lives yes we might we might face distress or persecution famine making his peril sword we might amen we might but look at the 36th verse as it is written for thy sake for his sake for the lord's sake we are killed all the day long we now it might not be a popular thing friend but we are killed all the day long for his sake that's following him that's being sheep of the good shepherd we are killed all the day long for him for his will we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter for our lives are laid down for our brothers our lives are laid down for him we are killed paul said i die daily we are killed all the day long for him for his will for his sake what does that mean that means my life is nothing my life to me is nothing it is only what he makes me it is only what he does for me through me it is only him which reiterates once again it's not about us this is not about us it's about him and our service to him yes amen let's stand if we could i had another scripture we'll pass on that sometimes it's easy to forget that especially with the spirit of the world the way it is today it's easy to predict that that it's not about us it's not it's not what is to be um based on my will of what i want or my comfort or like i said even my happiness god makes sure we're happy absolutely but it's not that i do things because i want to be happy i do things because he leads me to do them yes amen and if it makes me a little uncomfortable if it puts me in a place i don't want to go if it's a little more work for me or something whatever he wants for me that's what i want amen let's say the lord if i take a shortcut over here it's it's like sometimes me and brother roger will me and brother roger will go sometimes and we'll probably spend more time working on the job in our minds before we ever start doing anything because the job becomes less cumbersome and takes less time if we have everything laid out and knowing exactly what we're going to do before we put a wrench to anything screwdriver or whatever we we work it out in our minds first and of course especially what we do is pretty important because you get in trouble pretty quick but when you're cutting wall the holes in people's walls and stuff like this you want to make sure you know what you're doing and stuff's in the right place it's like the scripture says who who goes to war without first counting the cost right amen realize what you're doing and and sometimes because we're finite we'll say and he'll say something i'll say but you know what if we do this and he'll look and say yeah that would work better you know a different way of doing something a shortcut but you can't do that with god we try to do that probably with gods but god i i know a shortcut we can
