lord we give the rest of the service into your hands lord jesus and we ask and claim everything in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you maybe see it at this time um let's go over some testimonies and song specials with anyone as long but i do me and our family me and my family have a testimony for sure it was friday afternoon my wife was going out to the store in our car or suv and they didn't get very far maybe five miles but they were on the freeway so they they were traveling on the freeway at 65 to 70 miles per hour and uh she's my wife it was just my wife and my kids that were driving the car i was at work and um to have the started losing control of the car start swerving you know she wasn't sure what was going on and they ended up spinning out into the median um so i left from work you know she called me and um i just want to praise god that no one was hurt they are all fine uh the car is fine uh nothing we didn't hit anybody they didn't hit anybody they they didn't hit anything they didn't get injured in the accident so i mean i couldn't what happened i think is something to do with the tire um what we found out later is that some there was a malfunction with the tire um so i was able to get it towed home and uh fixed it up yesterday morning so i drove it around before we came today to just to see if anything was going on but just looking at it you wouldn't even be able to tell anything that happened to it so just really uh thank the lord in better words it's like he the way the car landed it was in the meeting a dirt median and on the freeway but it's like he landed them onto a pillow of just like soft dirt and there's a bunch of weeds and stuff but there was a tree maybe like 10 feet away you know there's railings guard railings they think so they spun into it so they could have spun into a car into anything but uh the lord really had his hand over them and amen blessing us with keeping them safe and keeping our car safe it's just it's just a miracle amen thank the lord this morning for watching over them praise the lord thank you lord thank you i know sister norma has a song special she'd like to share with us i'll ask her if she comes up this morning oh do you want to use the i can set it up for you if you want oh okay okay you never know who's watching in the internet so obedience is better than sacrifice amen yes lord spoke to joseph told him what to say to the children of israel [Music] our [Music] the spirit amen the sweet holy spirit is the token today god said would be said outside of this door [Music] better

to thank everybody for their prayers um sister enormous singing this song is just absolutely fitting um i was at the hospital yesterday with my dad getting all the paperwork and everything ready and i you know he just was saying how he just was tired and tired of being sick and going through everything that he has been and i tried talking to him about jesus and he's like just stop just stop and i said i don't understand why you won't talk about him i said the worst thing you can do is not be ready for him and so he laid there and he closed his eyes for a bit and then um i forget how it came up but we started i brought i brought up jesus again and he and i said you just have to make sure you have jesus in your heart and i said and take his hand and go i said it's the best thing you can do and he said that's what grandma always said meaning his mom and um i asked him i said so i said just look for him you know and he said i see him i see him and so i want to thank everybody for praying because it's right we claim our families and we were getting things ready yesterday um because it was the other thing that was like my prayer was for him to be home by my birthday well yesterday was my birthday and he's coming home today was so good right and i walked out yesterday and there was a double rainbow out after it had rained and stormed and i mean he just makes himself so real and i have this huge relief now just my lord saying that he's never been close to saying anything like that amen is amazing he's ready and i'm relieved amen happy birthday to you i did not know amen that's wonderful amen anyone else this morning song special or testimony i don't know my god let's just uh sing the song i gotta grab my content let's sing a couple verses like this [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i surrender [Music] save your eyes [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] i surrendered save your eyes to remember jesus [Music] i surrender [Music] oh [Music] save your eyes jesus [Music] salvation glory glory to is you [Music] oh [Music] amen that's my prayer this morning yes jesus just gave it all to him amen one last well i saw him before brother bennett comes up in his time amen [Music] he makes all these beautiful [Music] lord please show me every day [Music] in your time [Music] is [Music] things [Music] in your town [Music] in your town you make all these [Music] [Applause] [Music] me in your time [Music] show me every day [Music] praise the lord you know that's one thing that we seem to forget about a lot of times is that it's in his time amen patience is a virtue but it's a virtue that seems to be very scarce nowadays because we always want everything instantly we want everything right now we want god to do it this very second but you know it's much better if we just allow him to do it in his time and in his way everything works out as the song says beautiful in his time amen we met we mess it up so many times by trying to make something happen or be that uh that isn't isn't to be or isn't the right time but uh the lord makes all things beautiful in his time and we got everything in this world it's instant and fast and quick and right now and we can fly across the country in three hours it used to take days weeks months we can fly in a few hours we can get around the world we can get on the other side of the world half a day a man can't even i don't even know how long it would take them to have done it on a boat or ship or amen and and and used to be they couldn't do it at all and won't even talk about rockets and things that shoot up into the sky and uh get to the moon and it's just incredible microwaves uh cars modern conveniences it never seems to be enough for humans but you know if we can just get along with the lord we just get still before him just let him do it his way his time we know it'll work out right amen praise the lord so i appreciate the lord's goodness to us amen appreciate each one of you being here today trust the lord just bless you richly there was a couple things i failed to mention and put down as a prayer request i'd have yet uh pray for if you would the carpenter family they're ron and carol carpenters first grandchild or well wouldn't first second grandchild our first great-grandchild oh my rodney carpenter's first great-grandchild second grandchild but first great granddaughter of all the girls all the boys but first grade right well no first grade second they help a little boy okay beds ryan have two little boys a boy and he had a little girl so i did i wasn't aware of that either right so it's a first great grand girl girl girl oh my god anyway i got that all messed up uh anyway uh she she passed away in the infant that passed away um and certainly me and my wife can understand how that feels and what they're going through and understanding that there's no way we could have ever even attempted to imagine going through it without the lord jesus but the funeral is this wednesday so what did you ask would ask that you would pray for them pray for the family and all those that are involved you know the lord has the way and a reason for doing things sometimes you may never know what that reason is maybe this short of the other side but god has everything under control but again i just pray that you would i'd ask that you'd pray for them pray for the family and those with the passing of this baby and also next saturday uh sister norma's daughter kathy and daniel who made our pulpit are getting married next saturday and prescott so i pray that you'd uh ask to pray for them and pray for the marriage the union everything uh there that it would go great smooth wonderful the lord would just bless it thank you amen so remember that in prayer too if you would so thankful that god's good to us so uh oh also i want to continue to remember those that are in afghanistan uh the afghan people of course as a whole like i said you said well they're not christians or whatever they are but you know friend every one of them's assault worth 10 million worlds amen amen and of course there's christians that are stuck over there i found out this week or heard a report this week that the taliban is starting to go door to door checking for christians checking their phones for bible apps and stuff like that so just pray for them if you would also there's a category four or five hurricane hitting new orleans right now and louisiana new orleans i'm sorry but it's a very wicked city uh been there a couple times is all it's a it is a hotbed for demonic spirits but i know a lot of precious brothers and sisters that live in that vicinity not necessarily new orleans proper but in that vicinity around uh so just pray for them pray for the people pray for the christians the bride the uh god's children uh it looks like it's going to be a a pretty bad storm according to all the prognostications so uh ask you to pray for a lot lot praying for amen but we know the one who is listening we know the one who asked us to ask and we'll answer our needs according to his riches and glory amen so let's remember that and again i appreciate the lord's goodness appreciate each one of you being here today those who may be streaming lord bless you richly i'm thankful that brother angel third there seemed there seemed to have been all my texting some confusion angel third is priscilla's husband and the father of uh the five children that come here with uh uh savannah and shira and uh always give them to moses and savannah and uh and uh cheyenne and serenity and mariah that's angel third angel jr is his father who is genevieve's husband okay so there there's there's not a there's not an angel senior involved in this in fact i think angel seniors passed away if i'm correct with that this is we're referring to angel jr and angel third angel third who tested negative for covid and is doing better he told me yesterday he is doing better uh the infection's going away he's getting his strength back he's being able to have a conversation without losing his breath uh so apparently the pneumonia is lifting so we're very thankful for that but angel junior is still in the hospital and put him in icu yesterday it doesn't sound like he's getting better but it doesn't sound like he's getting worse he's able to talk to angel and as far as i can recall uh and but but he's in icu now and they've got him on antibiotics and things like that so uh continue to remember the freyjol family and of course angel jr being in the hospital and genevieve of course sister jenny we call her here remember her in prayer too she had been quite discouraged over this period of time and understandably so so please remember them in prayer as well if you will amen let's stand to our feet again if we could and turn in our bibles to first thessalonians chapter 4. we're on the rapture part 11. amen the rapture part 11. it's kind of a continuation of the last few services but with a little caveat to it um it's it's we're going to continue on a little bit with the with the condition of the world at the time of rapture and uh i want to if there's going to be a subtitle i haven't been subtitling the micah has so if you go on the website which i hope you go on the website maybe at least weekly daily whatever but if you go on the website you'll see micah's put a subtitle to each one that's come like after part four or five uh to each one of these and i guess if i were to put a subtitle on this one it would be the signs in heaven and earth the signs that are to be in heaven and in earth amen so the rapture part 11. so we'll read this person of the scripture against first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 the rapture um scripture for will but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious jesus father it's indeed a privilege lord to come in here and honor you once again lord and believing expecting you to meet with us father on this hallowed ground in this hallowed place lord that's been dedicated consecrated for service for you lord expecting and believing you god that you are here lord and that you move them in and out amongst the avenues of our heart lord that you touch and bless and strengthen us in every way god help those who may not have been able to make it today those you may be streaming father and each one that's here we just pray that your holy spirit would abound once again lord and and touch each one god each sick and body needy lord of many requests and many desires and many needs father that there are out there today god and in our little congregation but we believe father that you are the giver of every good gift lord and that you are our healer you are our great physician you are our family physician lord and we thank you so much that you are touched by the feeling of our infirmities it's so good lord to hear the wonderful positive blessed testimonies lord of you in our lives god and what you do for us and lord is so good to know that your hand is upon us in every way and no matter what it may look like god to us and what the circumstances may present themselves as we know god that out all things work together for the good of those that love you and we love you lord the world there's a lot of people in the world today they have a a passing affection for you lord they might have a little uh a little uh like for you lord as the world would say god but but there's a group of people lord that have an unconditional gophel love for you lord and those are the people that trust you that believe you god that all things work together for our good even if we don't understand it lord and god i pray that your holy spirit would come again once again now and lord as we've turned back the pages of this bible to speak to us from your word it'll not return void father and i believing that you're accomplishing that in each one of us as you would see fit we just give you the praise honor and glory and rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the praise the honor for all that is said and done here may it be a sweet smelling savior to you as we offered in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them once you're asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which slip sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we were to alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen you can be seated if you'd like amen i took a little part when i was been a couple weeks a week since ministering here uh it's strange when you uh basically minister every service for as long as it is and then there's a couple of weeks there where you you don't minister at least not here a couple weeks ago in san diego there's a little bit of a struggle um uh preaching through an interpreter i've preached through interpreters many times but uh when you're not used to it and it's not something you do on a on an ongoing basis it can be a little bit challenging so i'm thankful that uh you all here or americans or or here we know english and speak english and we don't have to have interpretation here so uh i think it makes a little bit a little bit better a little more the spirit flows and i appreciate god's goodness so now again we want to talk um i want to talk about the the rapture part 11 and about uh the signs in the heaven and earth amen the science in heaven and earth at the time of rapture all this of course uh is the accumulation of what we're looking to in the scripture of rapturing condition we talked about rapturing condition of a group of people we talked about rapture and condition of the world and and now we talk about the rapture and condition of the signs that jesus told us that we look to the heavens and in the earth so let's go to saint luke chapter 21. amen and we'll uh begin our scripture reading there verse 5. now um saint saint luke chapter 21 is is the same segment that we read the other day in matthew 24. matthew 24 and saint luke 21 are the same account of that event that his disciples came to jesus and was asking in those questions i picked saint luke 21 this time because it's there's a couple of other points that are made in here that matthew doesn't make in matthew 24. so man uh saint luke chapter 21 we'll begin reading with verse 5 saint luke 21 5. and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly uh goodly stones and gifts he said as for these things which ye be held behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be and what this and and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass and he said take heed that ye be not deceived now it's the same thing the same thing the first warning that jesus gave that was recorded in matthew is the same first warning that's given by jesus here in saint luke take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must come must first come to pass but the end is not by and by or is not yet then said they unto him nation uh unto them nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilence and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven but before all these things they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you and uh delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake so now i i want to continue on a drop down in in the same chapter but i want to focus on verse 11 right now jesus said there will be great earthquakes not just earthquakes but great earthquakes shall be in divers places now that word divers is diverse or multiple numerous okay so the earthquake seismic activity is supposed to be on a dramatic increase at the time of the rapture at the time of the end when all these things begin to unfold the the seismic earthquake activity is supposed to be increased to a place that it becomes more and more prevalent and noticeable diverse places numerous many okay diverse places that maybe didn't even know before of earthquakes taking place so well there's never been an earthquake there before well it's never been an end time like there's been now yeah amen that's why the things are happening the way they are so well it's never been like that before of course now the world they think they have an excuse they think they have a reason because they call it climate change well climate change to me i mean there's probably some truth to that but they what they don't realize that that it's scriptural they want to make it scientific or uh or all the other things that go on with what they can control and understand see the supernatural things they can't control the supernatural things they don't understand so they have to try to justify it in a way that they can try to put it in a little box and say well it's because of this i mean there's been such ridiculous things come out about that i heard somebody this week blaming the rise of al qaeda on climate change i mean that's how ridiculous this thing is to me it's not it's more of a money maker than anything i mean you look at the high people that are up there say like an al gore i mean they've become multi-millionaires just because they preach this i'm not saying there's not some climate change i'm not saying that amen the climate's getting ready to change because it's september's this week and it's gonna start getting cooler and climate change a couple months ago and it really started raining here pretty good climate change didn't it got real humid outside anyway i'm not i'm not saying that there's not a little truth to that because brother banner said men would destroy themselves right and that's the place we're getting to that this is happening all of the pulling out of the of the minerals and and the oil and the deposits in the earth you can't do that and not expect there to be a ripple effect if you go look in a tub of water and you reach in uh to grab a stone at the bottom of the water there's gonna be a rippling effect to your hand entering in the water and pulling that stone out right now it might not be significant to you to look at but there's going to be a change there's going to be an effect and when you keep dipping into this earth pulling all the stuff out of it there's going to be an effect there's going to be a change to the to the makeup of this earth for that reason men are killing themselves and then and then the earth starts groaning and the earth starts shaking and the earth starts belching and that's exactly what's going on but we know that it is scriptural to be doing that because there's going to be earthquakes in different places there's going to be these these famines and pestilence and fearful great sights in earth and in heaven things that they never knew before to my knowledge there's still huge fires roaring in california oregon washing nothing why is it there you think you look around the rest of the country and they say they blame all that on climate change but but why is it in all the rest of the country oh sure we have some fires here in arizona but as far as i know they're all out we have fires in other parts of the country but as far as i know most if not all of them are out but the west coast is still burning to the ground why see you you can say it's one thing but when you isolate it down and you realize there's something more going on than just what science can say they can prove that's right and what they can put in a little box and say it's xyz and they label that xyz or climate change or whatever and they label it this and now they've got an explanation to tell you why things are happening the way they're happening what are they doing they're circumventing everything that's in this in the scripture that tells us why it's happening that way you cannot put god in a box you cannot put the holy spirit in a box you can't just say here's god in this little square like denominations do and say this is all god is this is who god is this is all god is and this is what we know and what we have about god when friend you can't do that you can't put the supernatural in a box you can't put god in a boss you can't say well it's this is all there is to god and that's all there's going to be it doesn't work that way and when they can't explain it when they can't deny it because it's you know it's here you can't deny it you can't explain it then they get to the place that they gotta figure out somehow that they can say oh world now remember this allowed to see an age more than any age because god described it that way is a prideful age we are built up and and and puffed up in pride this age just lay out the cnh by by description revelation 3 is a prideful age and and as smart as intelligent as these people are they feel like they have got to be able to explain everything because they're so smart right we know everything and they've got to do that if they want to portray themselves to the world as god if the government and medicine and science is the ultimate in this world which is what they'll preach to you they're the ultimate don't you dare question their authority don't you dare bring up the fact that a hundred years ago scientific facts are not even close to what they've proven to be today don't even begin to touch the medical world or the government oh they know it all and don't don't don't even dare to begin to question their authority because you're wrong and you'll be what they call today canceled because you because they know better they're prideful they have to be able to explain everything reason away things that are happening in this earth today that only christians and dares i say only god's bride when he breaks it right down to it know what is going on amen they know it because they see it in the scripture they know it because god's revealed it to them they know it because we have that anointing of the holy ghost that is leading us in that way and as god does that he reveals himself to us to help us know this is that time this is what's going on that's the greatest sign we can have to recognize that this is a rapturing day this is a day for rapture earthquakes shall be in diverse places famines pestilence you say brother newton there's been pestilence and there's been people sick for uh and hungary and famines that that's been going on for for hundreds of years if not thousands of years that's true but when you start adding all of the things up and you start grouping them into a into a group because jesus didn't just say this is going to happen or this is going to happen he said this and this and this and this and this and this is all going to happen it's all going to come together it's all going to be there at one time and all these things are going to happen to the point that men begin to die because of the fear of their hearts yes amen amen earthquakes in different places in diverse places volcanoes sas seismic activity extreme weather um i've had people tell me in the past couple of weeks my son has an app on his phone i think sister sheila has pointed out we saw the earthquake in haiti again of of all the shakings that are going on around this country and around the world now it is constant yes this this earth uh this earth is is is is having a gastronomical jubilee it is belching and burping so much underneath the surface it's rocking and rolling places all around the world continuously not just a little earthquake here not just a little something over there but continually and there's going to continue to be great earthquakes in these multiple places because that's what god said i read an article a couple of weeks ago that there were six active volcanoes on the uh through the alaskan islands down through their six volcanoes active at one time just along the islands now they don't report it so much you don't hear it very much because it's not inhabited it's not affecting directly affecting people from but this is going on as we know it right now and and and we can see it we can know it and it helps us to realize that these that these pestilence that are happening today uh that this i now personally i believe it probably came out of a lab but it wasn't that wasn't an accident it was all purposeful friend and and now variant upon variant or whatever they're saying is gonna happen now i don't know i i i honestly um i i don't freak out about it it's i i want this to sound right i don't want this to sound bad i mean i attended the funeral of two precious friends last week that died of kobe but so i don't want to understate it but i want to understand look friend that is is not something that's that's adversely affecting my life it's just not uh it's it's not something that uh that that rolls my spirit over it it just doesn't it's these pestilences that's going on in the world today and look could covet let me ask you this could covet just be one of the beginnings of that i remember when aids come out oh my they had no cure for aids and everybody was going crazy about aids and then of course it was a rebuke on the gay community and things like that but the whole point was it was nothing then you had uh sarge you had n1h1 or h1n1 or i've heard the the pig flu swine flu the the chicken flu the the cow flu the uh and it's just it just keeps building and building well now they've got something that has that has actually struck fear in the hearts of people yeah uh when all this other stuff was going on it's like well okay you know and moving on and yeah thousands of people died but they've gotten everything positioned understand me now the government the medical community the world at large they've gotten this perfect storm now with coven to where they've struck fear in the hearts of people and when they get fear on the people is when they can bring control on the people and when when someone else listen to me when somebody or something else can gain control over you you will forget and lose your identity yes and when you lose your identity and you don't realize who you are you can't have faith and without faith it's impossible to please god and without faith you'll never go on a rapture if you lose that identity friend that and that's exactly what people are doing call them names you can put just robot one robot two robot three because that's all the humanity is becoming controlled and manipulated by the powers that be all that's a part of what we see in the scripture you say well that's a that's a big leap brother knew i don't think it is because it all brings down to the laodicean church age this end time age to help us the bride recognize the rapturing time that we're living the fulfillment of scripture where all these not just a pestilence not just a famine not just an earthquake here or there but the accumulation of all of the things that jesus mentioned coming to a head at one time right now or in our in plentiful supply now let me continue let's drop down to the 25th verse amen and keep in mind let me read the 11th verse again first and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places famines and pestilence and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven 25th verse and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring why are the seas and the waves roaring because the earth beneath it beneath it is shaking and rocking and belching that's why because everything around it the seismic activity has the effect on the water that is that it's housing this earth is housing the water and when the earth begins to move and shake then it has an effect on the water look at the big tsunamis that have happened and white people and and towns really off the map just swept it right onto the ocean amen thousands of people but there's going to be distress distress of nations now with the current conditions that's happened with this with governmental decisions that have been made and yes i'm talking about the united states you see now a distress among nations even some of the closest allies the united states has is criticizing the united states actually see some people in power in other nations are saying they will no longer rely on or support the united states well where does that put us friend i mean we're the most powerful nation on the earth still greatest place to live i believe but we can't do it alone we have to have people that that are on our side now it's becoming it's almost to the place i won't say it is but it's seemingly almost to the place that it's each country for itself each country looking out for their own interests looking out for their own way and saying you know what we're gonna take care of number one now if we can do anything to help you we might right if it's in our best interest amen and i don't have a problem with that i honestly think that was donald trump's philosophy the united states first and will help you in every chance that we get as long as it helps it doesn't denigrate our country right now that's out the window but the world the world scene now is at the place at at great distress amongst one another's with perplexity now you might not understand what that word means i didn't i had a working knowledge of it but i looked the definition perplexity means unable unwilling or or not able not unwilling but unable to be able to take care of conditions they don't understand now today in in a perplexed society we have having multiple things that are going on that men and governments and countries have no idea what to do about it they don't have the answer now they're going to make something up they're going to do the best they can and of course they're going to control the people in the meantime they're going to do the best they can to try to put a a put a box around it and say it's x y or z but the truth is they have no idea they are unable to tackle the dilemmas that are hitting this world today nobody has the answer he said biden's a horrible president i agree but donald trump didn't have the answer for this amen you know who has the answer christ god his word there's no government there's no nation there's no president or governing body that has the answer falci doesn't have the answer the medical field the science world they don't have the answer the only answer is in christ in his word that's the only answer and if you follow him and let him reveal that word to you and live according to just a good godly humble christian life then god will reveal to you and when it's time god will take you home that's the rapture and conviction seeing the perplexity that's going on they don't have the answers for many years they've had the answers they don't there is no answer today they don't know what there's a lot of people even governors of this country stabbing in the dark trying to figure out what to do still do with kova that's going on what do we do now let's just shut everything down again well that's not going to help that all that does is ruin people's lives yeah well it's just throw mass on every kid in school all you're doing is ruining that child's life i mean that's just been proven medically yeah that you're just killing those kids well then let's just uh let's say let's do this and let's do that and try everything but they don't have the answer well let's get everybody vaccinated friend that's not the answer either amen that is not the answer either they're talking about booster shots now is that going to be the answer that's not the answer the answer lies in christ in his word it's the only place there's an answer the answer is to understand we're living in perilous times the answers to understand by the word of god jesus said what it would be like and it's here amen is it going to be today i don't know tomorrow don't know next week don't know could it be 10 15 20 years from now sure could amen i believe that could it be 5 10 15 minutes from now yeah it could be i just know we're at that time right that season scripturally we understand what's going on the numerous things that are taking place the distress of nations with perplexity they're not just distressed they don't know what to do about it they are absolutely incapable to handle it unable they can't do it sees the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear men's hearts men's beating hearts and their chest stopping to operate the way god intended when he created man their hearts are failing them why oh they have heart disease no well they have clogged arteries no that's not what the bible says the bible didn't say men's hearts are stopped because of claude artery it says their men their men's hearts are stopping because of their fear that's what it says would know what's going on failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the power of heaven shall be shaken amen then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption drop night praise the lord when these things begin to come to pass our redemption drawing night friend that's the time jesus exhortation look up because your redemption is drawing nigh friend i just echoing the words of jesus look up our redemption's drawing night this rapture is more imminent than we ever could have thought or imagined we're here we're at this time amen one more verse 36 look at this now 36 verse this is the beautiful ending to this 36 watch ye are you listening you're listening streaming read with me watch you therefore and pray always are we doing that yes amen amen watch ye therefore and pray always are we doing that i'll say it again i'm not i know michael is very jubilant in his uh uh answer but you don't you don't have to answer you know it's in your heart you know you're streaming you know if you watch this you know watch ye therefore and pray always why that ye may be accounted worthy to do what escape amen you know what that means that means with all this that we just read and all that we just said and everything that's going on in our lives in this country around the world can be escaped there is a way of escape amen that you're accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man watch you therefore and pray always that ye be found worthy to escape to escape so if there is a way of escape then there's a way that god has made for his children not to become privy or or or subjects of of this end time hallelujah has provided a way of escape for her just like sister norma saying to us today there's a way of escape that the death angel pass god's bride is safe amen at last right and though death angel sweeping through the place god took care of his children death didn't touch his people there was a way of escape god always makes a way of escape for his people let this death angel pass because the bride is safe amen where is she safe in that token the holy ghost the inoculation that god has given his bride for this last day we are safe there should be no men's hearts failing for fear amongst the children of god because they're brought they are safe amen safe in christ safe in his word look at this now and now i'm going to start reading a few quotes here i got a scripture i want to get to because we've talked a lot about the earth and i i got a few minutes left i want to talk about the heavens amen but let me read this they are the seventh the exposition seven church eight laodicean church age they are miserable and we know that's what the bible says that church age book this is this is the book they are miserable that means that they are objects to be pitied pitied they scorn pity they are full of pride and that's exactly what it is full of pride they want what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built upon quicksand rather than the rock of the revelation of god's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will come the storms of the wrath of god in judgment now we know the earthquake is going to sink california and we know that that's already been prophesied we know that's going to happen science even science has come and said she's honeycombed underneath there and that you could go a mile or more back underneath california and there's nothing under there but water and now that uh that san andreas fault has has cracked so far it's i don't know what it is that now but it's this huge crack friend i'll just take a certain vote jolt that that guy will just it'll just break right off and slide right in the ocean and it'll happen it's going to happen amen i don't know if we'll be here i actually i don't believe will be here uh or or it will be simultaneous but it will happen amen it's going to happen soon cometh the earthquake soon there will be there will come the storms of the wrath of god's judgment the wrath of god judgment oh you can call it climate change all you want friend but i have the truth of god's word the storms of the wrath of god's judgment then comes sudden destruction and in spite of all their carnal preparations they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the earth carnal preparations they build better buildings in california oh it we stand withstand all these earthquakes they built all these great levees and stuff in new orleans to help the water and thing pump pump all the water that we've made everything so much better but the destruction that's coming to this earth there is nothing man has done or could do that's going to save them from it nothing the only safe place is in christ despite all their carnal preparations they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the earth there are those who in spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and they don't even know it objects of pity they are indeed amen now i want to go i won't finish that let's let's go over to genesis now genesis chapter 18. earthquakes in diverse places pestilence famines fearful sights things that government medicine science has no answer for the world has no answer for what is that that's perplexity they don't know how to fix it they don't know how to make it better that's their whole thing they they want to be able to explain everything they want to be able to put it in a little box and there's things that they just can't do it so they make excuses genesis chapter 18 verse 16 let's read this this is a visitation of god and gabriel and michael brother brown said the three angels one was the lord jesus the lord god that came and visited abraham before the destruction of solo 16th verse genesis 18 16. and the men rose up from thence and looked towards sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said and and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him amen that includes us that includes the bride amen the royal seat of abraham was jesus jesus we came from as our savior from the side of of christ came the bride so that's us he's talking about us amen amen and god is not going to let his son be ignorant to the things that he's about to do right amen amos says surely the lord god will do nothing except you reveal his secrets to this his servants the prophets that's why there had to be in this last day a seventh angel prophet messenger to come to bring the word so that we could see him in the word and unfold and reveal everything that he had intended to do through the scripture now this bride this last day he's gone on she was a part of he was a part is a part of that bride this brighter the last day now god must make her privy to those things that he's doing because he's not going to hide those things from his own so if there's something significant that's about to take place she's going to know it god's going to reveal it to her we don't know the day or the hour okay so don't get me wrong there i i never go against the scripture and say well the bride was she's gonna know the day or the hour no but i believe that she will know when that time arises and that that time that we're looking for of the season is here yeah yeah because you revealed it to abraham and abraham was his representative on the earth at that time well who's his representative on the earth now god always has representation on the earth you know that well who's his representation now it's the gentile bride we're at that representation of him on earth right now well he's not going to leave us in the dark morning he left abraham in the dark amen so we know and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know now there's three of them we know the scripture tells us there's three of them where do these three come from well abraham had his tent pitched outside of sodom but as abraham had his tense tent pitch he was out there and he sees them coming towards him now the scripture does not describe in detail if you will how they came to him but he saw them coming and he ran to meet them and bowed down and said my lord which we know would signify that the one there was god amen the other two angels they came for a purpose those three came for a purpose what was that purpose to visit abraham well god had already visited abraham amen but god had to make abraham aware of what he was about to do so he had to come by and when they got there abraham said oh come rest your feet set let's kill the fatted calves you can have milk and uh and and rest yourselves and eat and and abraham did that for them wash your feet and that was abraham's welcoming of them but that's not why they came they came for the purpose of the investigation of sodom and gomorrah look i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether together according to the cry which come to me and if not i will know what is that that is an investigation god said i will go did he go he stood there with abraham but who went his representatives the angels that came with him they went down to sodom but but god stayed back with with abraham and begin to talk to him while the other two went down to do the investigation but what was their purpose of coming their purpose of coming was to investigate what was going on in sodom to see whether it was what was reported or not now of course god always knows but he gives everybody every one of us a fair chance that's what justice is that's why god told abraham's lineage and family will continue to practice justice and judgment what is justice justice is saying okay i'm going to go and give them a fair chance and see whether it is that they are what they say they are or if they're going to repent or what's going to happen and he says i'm going to go check it out and investigate but they came by abraham because abraham was his representative on earth and he needed to let abraham know what he was about to do that's why he came by abraham to let abraham know this is what i'm going to do and when we go down there we'll know and god sent his investigative angels to go look and see is sodom what it says it is now when they left from abraham we have in our minds that these two angels just continue to just walk down to sodom just just like you're walking and just like you're on a hike well where you going going to sodom but we don't know how they went down there we don't we don't know how those angels ended up in sodom we don't know that we just know they went there how did they get there they were in they were in theophany corporal bodies sure because they ate and drank but we don't know they could have walked it but we don't know how did the angels come to brother branham right was he said that was he standing out there at sunset mountain running up the side of that hill and hear that explosion going there and then some angels coming walking over the hill no it didn't happen that way now see this we can get a description of we can get an understanding of how that happened because brother branham was there and he told us how it happened right they didn't come walking over the hill there was an explosion and all of a sudden those seven angels standing right in front of him in the shape of a pyramid just like that faster than that there they were there they were right in front of him explosion fam there they were how did these two angels get to sodom i don't know but they could have gone the exact same way that these angels came to brother brown they could have left the presence of god and abraham and finn and sodom just like that right these are supernatural beings friend see that's the one thing i've tried to explain to people who just can't get a grasp on the cloud right is it first of all don't let that have any bearing on your salvation because it doesn't on anybody's but you can't all these naysayers and critics they keep trying to put god and the supernatural in a box and you can't do that look friend i believe what what brother branham said was about that and i believe that that was supernatural that took place and people said well it was here then and it was here there and it had to go over here and it had to drift this way and it had to happen that way no it didn't it could have happened anyway god wanted it to happen right those seven could appear right now in this room if they wanted to right that clown could be right on the ceiling at this second if you wanted to it could be right over top of this building it could be out there when you go outside right and in and you know and in a blink of an eye they could be from outside this building to africa just like that because they're supernatural beings you can't put that in the box you can't just you can't just corral that down to say oh it's got to be this way and it's got to be that way no it doesn't it can be any way it wants to see well they got their picture taken in february and brother brandon wasn't down there doesn't matter they could be there then they could be there then they could be over there then they could have came from this direction they could have done this they could have done that because they're supernatural beings they could have been where the one at any time abraham begins to have a conversation with god well will you destroy it for this many would destroy it no it fears down to 10 god said no i'll not destroy it if i find 10 did he find 10 no so it got destroyed but the point of the angels was the investigation now let's talk about the signs in the heavens for just a few minutes have you ever noticed at the increase of the activity in the heavens of all of these things that they don't know what they are they've dubbed them years ago ufos because they call them unidentified flying objects and they don't know what they are some people say well it's the government because they keep it a secret since when has the government been able to keep secrets the government can't keep secrets especially nowadays there's there's leakers on that this country is so divided and particle uh uh uh party partisan democrat liberals whatever they're so divided now all it takes is one and it leaks out and that's and everybody knows about it government can't keep a secret he said there's all kinds of things there probably are things that that we don't know won't ever know but people say oh they know what these things are they're in control of that but they won't tell anybody no you know why the government doesn't tell people about what ufos are because they don't know they don't know and they're embarrassed that they don't know because they're a bunch of prideful arrogant people who are supposed to be able to be so smart that they can explain everything and they have no idea amen you don't hear about it from them because they just don't know the pentagon actually in the past month released a statement about these objects because they're becoming so prevalent now i don't know if they're more prevalent now i would say they are but i also say there's more video cameras around now than there used to be it used to be people say i saw so and so and they put you in a room about the size of our front room with a bunch of rubber on the walls you saw what yeah okay you come with me i got a nice room for you it's padded we'll give you some medicine and you'll be okay but now they've got phones and cameras everywhere you say oh no i didn't just say i saw it i took a picture of it i got a video of this thing screaming through the sky people say there's nothing on the planet that can go that fast or maneuver like that or even they've had some navy ships in san diego see these things dip beneath the ocean and shoot through the ocean at supersonic beyond supersonic speed and they have no answer for it they don't know there's still to them ufos because they're unidentified to those people they have no clue but they're so prideful they won't just come out and say look we don't know what this is we don't know if these are aliens we don't know if these are beings from other planets we don't know if this was a greater intelligence but i'm here to tell you this morning friend that we know yes we know what they are we know if these things are screaming through the sky because we had a prophet come and tell us what they were yeah and showed us in the scripture where they're identified amen investigating judgment angels are we at that time yeah if we're at that time then all that's going to begin to increase it's going to become more and more numerous and that's exactly it's become so numerous that uh certain uh media outlets are starting to pick it up even more now and people are starting to do special reports and investigations special investigations on these things that are dipping beneath the ocean and screaming navy planes on their radar picking these things screaming through the sky that they have no idea because their planes won't go that fast there's not a rocket that we built to go to the moon that won't go that fast and maneuver like that they can go across the sky faster than anything we've invented and stop just like that and hover move diagonally but we know what they are the world calls them ufos you know what i call them ifos because to me they're identified flying objects because they've been identified to the bride she knows what they are because she's had a prophet come and tell her what they are amen i've got some quotes i might skip some of it because it's it's 12 it's time to close he said did you notice the angels that came down and investigated sodom before sodom was destroyed do you remember that there's a three of them that came down stayed with abraham there were lights brother adam said there were lights from heaven that came down in the investigating judgment look uh look where they're found around the pentagon all these things they follow the world's judgment sodom there is one representative will be represented among the churches will be christ himself vindicating himself sights in the heavens above the signs the earth beneath certainly that's exactly what's happening right now he talks he tells about junior jackson's dream that junior had about seeing brother bannon when he came out west and he and he said he saw it he looked back east and he saw this look like a little spot he called it that looked like a flying saucer that was shooting towards brother branham that's the way he identified it see the world don't know what that you is you know it's on we know what it is we know it's investigating judgment angels see they don't realize what it is see let me uh let them think whatever they want to they call them flying sausage or whatever but that's because they don't know they don't know what it is my he talks about the example he had in sunset mountain let me read you a couple here i'm going to close he said in christ revealing his own word we could have uh we could not get any continuity amongst medics among scientists different ones if einstein he said had only had had the spiritual application to the physical application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something but of course we know einstein didn't have a spiritual application thank god we know one who did when we hear his message on the great center somewhere in the skies ever contacted with that center you could create earth do anything and the power would be unlimited you see these little pockets going through the air they call them saucers so forth well he said i said i better leave that alone here all these people come up missing don't hear from them they're standing here and then they're not there that's the way the rapture is going to be one of them will rot drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and there won't be hide here bone left the rapture it'll be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home taking us home we see what's going on now but they don't know what it is little children listen it's going to pick you up one of these days don't worry amen he's going to pick you up one of these days i'm looking forward to that day friend amen amen he says we're living in the shadows of his coming and those shadows are becoming more positive year by year we see the signs appearing fearful sights we see in newspapers magazines moon turning to blood they even had a movie about the blood moons uh that uh preacher whatever his name is hey no it was a haiti i had the blood moons oh they can have them but they can have uh uh movies about blood moons but they have no idea what it is they got no revelation about it i went and watched it one time with some brothers in the theater i saw the blood moon movie and it meant it made absolutely no sense it didn't it wasn't scriptural it was just something to try to get people to say oh this blood moon and there's going to be signs in the heavens blood but what does that mean what's the point what's the purpose and he had no clue there's no revelation there friends see fearful sights we see the newspapers about the moon turning to blood we hear of earthquakes all around the world blasting the whole world amen he talked about finding the earthquake that shook the time of jesus and history repeating itself to be the same way amen things will be taking place like we see them today and people and the world doesn't know what they are they don't know how to explain them i had somebody ask me here what about those flying saucers the ufos and things and you see them all the time now and they're all over the news and people have pictures of them in videos what is it that's going on up there sights in the heaven fearful to those who don't know it's a blessing to those who do know right because we know what they are right we know their purpose being here we know what they're accomplishing and we know that that one of them's going to drop down and pick us up one of these days amen praise the lord i i saw a movie one time that brother john hall recommended i'm trying to remember the name of it uh but but it was it was like about supernatural things and prophecy and uh and at the end these kids these two little kids running towards the tree of life and and these look like space rockets coming off the earth like this and one of them picked those kids up and took them away i thought my this my this person might have a bit more revelation than what we think amen but i believe not the movie but i believe what the prophet told us and and and matches with the scripture amen that's the main thing matches with the scripture so what day are we living what time is it friend where are we at is it rapture time i believe it's rapture time frame amen those investigating judgment angels are becoming more more prevalent all around us those ufos to the bride or ifos because we know exactly what they are amen praise the lord let's stand if we could amen can i add something god revealing himself a video of what you were talking about and these are inter-dimensional beings you could see them come into our dimension they would just all of a sudden appear and you can also see them go to the spot and then disappear they were coming in and out of our dimension you could see it and there were these these lights and then they'd zip around and then they would disappear in that spot and then they would and then another one would just up here and then zip around [Music] amen we know what they are praise the lord thankful to know it's like when we were talking about the cobot and the vaccination and the thing that's going on around the world today that the vaccination is the mark of the beast you know without this message and without the truth of the word revealed word for the day and a vindicated prophet we would never know that right you could i appreciate brother dennis pointing that out how prevalent uh and how important it is to understand that what we are privy to in this message and what we know and i can look at that and i say oh no that's not the mark of the beast because i know it's not the mark of the beast but the importance of why and how we know that amen is the importance of how and why we know what we know about these other things that's going on around the world today the the ufos and all this we know that because because we believe a message that's right amen we know that message to be the truth amen 4 24 let's sing this little course so glad i'm yours lord amen you may know it without turning to it 4 24 so glad i'm yours lord amen [Music] me so glad you found me and you set me free so glad i'm yours

to go home yeah he should have been home a month ago or more he's been over covered for a month and a half they've tested a negative negative name and but being in the hospital and back and forth rehab and hospital and his staff and all this other stuff and a poor guy just won't go home be with his family and i can't blame him but uh people who scream they want social medicine well there's just a little microcosm of what social medicine will give you she couldn't take her dad she couldn't take her own father home because it cut off his insurance if he did that i mean what is a person supposed to do so praise the lord i'm glad he's getting to go man amen i i told her he'll probably just get a nice renewed fervor for life with his family there and be just fine yeah after all that

send a text with the address on it okay yeah i'll have to get it from him i've been there with him one time to help him move his piano and chairs in but i could tell you how to get there it's right off frye boulevard i know that which is the main road in sierra vista but i'll have to send the address if anybody would like to do that but we'll have regular service here and then i'll go eat lunch and then go down to sierra vista uh next sunday so i'm also looking into uh getting uh updated streaming equipment uh brother roger told me about a little camera that is that now has a lot of the capabilities as those two thousand dollar cameras that used to be the big ones uh that we could just hang off the ceiling here and looking into that so appreciate you helping us pray about that and seeing uh if that would work this lord's will if people are going to continue to stream the services although i'd rather see every one of you in bodily presence here at the in the tabernacle here if they're still going to be streaming in that then you know if we're going to do it i want to do it right i want to do it as good quality as we as a small church can do so lord willing we'll do that appreciate your prayers about that and i also wanted to mention that that i have noticed that different ones have been putting uh some more offering and thing in in the in the offering and that has helped a lot i want you to know that i recognize it i know god sees it and just pray this the lord richly bless you amen i haven't when i took this you know place and the increased expense you know i i felt it was of the lord and when you feel some things of the lord it's like brother green said what did brother green say he'll pay the bills amen so and but but most of the time a lot of times in his paying the bills he uses us to do it amen and uh and i've noticed i've noticed a difference and even if it's just a little bit here and there but it's made a huge difference and i want to know i see it i know god sees it and just pray the lord richly bless you for returning 100 fold to you amen and thank god i thank him all the time for giving us this place so god's been good to us and you love him i enjoyed last week's service you enjoyed last week brother danny brother daniel evans uh i really enjoyed it very much enjoyed his spirit enjoyed the fellowship afterwards uh it was a real blessing to have him here so lord willing will try to have some more he's going to be moving to tucson permanently in november so we'll see we'll see how that goes but he still doesn't know where he's going to end up going to church for a home church yet but i'm sure the lord will lead him and wherever he wants him to go but yeah i sure enjoyed last week good to see sister marylee and brother jeremy and um but uh god uh god just knows how and when to do it amen amen so god reached the bless you love you appreciate you all today amen does anyone else have anything before dismissed amen appreciate you coming again appreciate you streaming if you're still there brother newton um i heard that um there is some christians that converted you know from islam and we're at right now and the united states is fighting them coming here so the man i don't know if you know who glenn beck is he's raised money and getting them out of there yeah but he'd have to that's hard to do there's only one way out of there and that's cabal airport and cabal is completely guarded by the taliban well he was able to get two thousand christians wow so we just practiced his heart that god will get his children that's a tough one yeah yeah that's why i was saying that i i'd heard the taliban's going around i i don't i don't know and i'm not going to accuse the united states of yeah i shouldn't have said that making those people stay there but but i do know that they're doing very little to help them get out they're like uh you know we know so and so well get them to the airport we'll get them home i'm sorry i can't hop in my car and drive down to t.i.a and go take a flight it doesn't work that way in afghanistan and cabal and governed by the taliban it doesn't work that way but anyway i know they're not making it even easier so god bless his heart for trying to help rescue those people because that's yes just pray for them it is it is a horrible i'm sorry i'll close we have um a very divided country politically um i have my views most of my views are based on the fact that one party believes in abortion and the other doesn't that's that's my biggest thing but um we're killing babies let's put it that way see a beautiful smile see what can you imagine if how people somebody can kill that beautiful baby anyway that's my view but but there's actually a a general consensus among both sides they're actually starting to agree now that this whole afghanistan thing was a disaster a horrible horrible disaster so anyway um yes please let's continue to pray for them and god bless this man's heart for trying to help people get out christians and because i like i said i did hear they're going door-to-door knocking on doors and checking phones for bible apps and stuff like that so and they'll and they'll kill them on the spot no i mean they they have no the the girls and women will be sex slaves and they'll kill the men and uh yeah it is a ruthless horrible ungodly scenario that is unfolding and is going to just get worse if the if if and when we do leave for good which is supposed to be in three days so anyway uh it's just sad i hate to keep talking about it but it's really been sad to me i've seen some of the videos and stuff did you say that he's getting people out other ways other than cabal aircraft i don't know how he's doing it but he could be getting him to other countries since america won't take him well we'll talk about that later well the reason i'm saying well i'm not going to ask if you could send the link to pastor so pastor can send it to everybody else so they can do their research and if they want to donate to this to this cause to get the people out if you can't give america can't get them out the airport can't get them out then this then this man heard that he was getting them out other ways out of the country other ways and uh okay amen i just hope i pray that's true so um and i believe it is because i know who you're talking about and uh so god richly bless you appreciate you coming i mean we're at the end this this is the end time it's later than we think yeah and i believe just any moment in time i i have to give my sincerest gratitudes and thanks to the lord jesus for having my daughter and my grandchildren with us yeah that going down the interstate that fast and have something like that happen there's a thousand things that could have gone wrong that they wouldn't have been here today amen and and for god to do what he did was like zach said it's just a miracle yeah just amazing oh praise and glory to him amen amen let's bow our heads lord jesus father we're so very thankful god what you do for us every day you are so good to us lord and sometimes there's probably many things you do for us that we'll never even know things you do and keeping us out of trouble or harm's way or what are sicknesses or whatever lord that god we may never even know but lord you always watch over us
