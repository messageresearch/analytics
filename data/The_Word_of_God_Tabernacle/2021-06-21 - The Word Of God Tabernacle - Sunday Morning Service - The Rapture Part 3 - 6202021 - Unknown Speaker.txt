my big toe i don't know if many of you remembered the prayer requests that i had put in about it maybe about a month ago now but they just found out just by the looks of it and looking at the x-rays and things that was actually been broken but i just want to praise the lord that he had touched my toe and there's no pain there's a little bit of weirdness still but um you know i didn't it should

blessing us in every way you know friend there's no greater life on the planet earth amen to be a christian and be a part of the plan of god be a part of the body of christ nothing greater on earth amen praise the lord i've seen a lot of people seen a lot of lifestyles and a lot of lives lived a lot of the way people do and go about but there's nothing better than to live a life for jesus christ amen people think they have all kinds of fun in the world and they may they may have their fun i guess it satisfies whatever appetite they have but you know my appetite was changed many years ago and it could only be filled by jesus christ it can only be quenched by him and his spirit and his life and his word and amen and people say how could you do that how could you live that way because it's it's in me right and it's who i am you get changed and it'll change you too you'll no longer desire the things of the world you'll desire the things of christ desire the things of the word amen but it takes a change first praise the lord so amen i'm so thankful god blesses us fills us with his spirit amen thank you for coming today we appreciate you streaming if you're on the stream today and god

him and uh not that i'm anything in this world but you know um my dad my mother my dad put my feet on the path of of truth uh when i was born as a son uh to them and uh and the word and you know we started out as denominational people baptist and all but uh but it was it was the the home that i lived in it was the spirit of the home it was the word that was there and of course the moving into the message and the truth and uh and i'm i'm so very thankful because not everybody's had that same uh opportunity and the and the way to start off that way my wife herself was not afforded the opportunity to that her feet would be planted like mine were planted so many years ago and i attribute that to my dad as the strength as a spiritual hold in my home and uh appreciate him and love him so much he's been gone from me now oh how old are you 31. 29 years i think michael was two when he passed away you know it's 93 yeah 93 is right for tabitha was born so and she's about to be 28 on

doing fine uh her dad's oxygen level's gone up and he's doing much better all of his tests are coming back negative and uh he's doing wonderfully as well so they're still in the hospital but please continue to remember them in prayer they're going to try a couple different drugs on her dad and uh see how that goes but so far his oxygen levels coming up they've reduced the the the uh his intake of oxygen which means he's doing much better so we're very very thankful for that and again and and sister julie has shown no symptoms she's had her negative test and she's believing the one she has coming up is going to be negative too so please continue to remember that in prayer amen and just trust the lord touch her and keep her covered free yeah it's been my prayer ever since this thing

bible with them maybe this family up here could use one if anybody happens to have one i do not but if you do first thessalonians amen first thessalonians chapter four amen first thessalonians chapter four we're going to start where we've been starting the past few services amen but let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we would before we read the word precious kind and gracious heavenly father we love you we thank you god for all that you do for us every day you are our heavenly father and lord as it is celebrated in this country today of a father's day a day singled out it's a recognition to all that the fathers do lord and it seems like sometimes the way the country has gone and the way things are happening today is probably a fundamental breakdown of fathers being in homes and being fathers to their families and being being dads there to their children and lord it's a it's a bad uh attribute that we have displayed probably in this country of the la of the homes that have a lack of a father the lord we thank you god that you have shined your light upon our pathway as our father that you have kept us together you have kept us close to you lord close to one another and and you've kept our home lord the home that we are housed in as a body of of believers lord you have kept us housed lord together under that great auspice of the spirit of almighty god yes our father brooding over us every day lord watching over blessing keeping us healthy strong for your service thank you so much lord for never leaving or forsaking us lord all the many attributes that you give us and show to us in this life we are nothing without you lord and we thank you so much for that positive influence and that that positive direction that you give us and the positive spirit lord that we feel and know that is always with us lord god may you just bless each one that's come here today may your hand be upon them bless and strengthen them may you speak to us lord by your word knowing that it will not return void but accomplish that in there that you would have it to accomplish in each one of us let that word father it is this spoke to us speak back to us and reveal that word to our hearts that we may draw closer to you in these last days if we're not converted or have your holy spirit lord may you fall fresh even now god feel each one of us lord as you sweep through this place empowering manifestation of your spirit in a supernatural way we believe and accepted god today but you are still the same yesterday today and forever you still do the same now as you have always done we're expecting miracles god we're expecting you to move in our congregation those who may be here may not be here today lord just thank you god for all that you've done for us bless the fathers today and lord may we continue to be the fathers and our children and dads lord and whatever the situation may afford the lord glory be to you our lord and savior our god and father we just give you praise honoring glory today bless the service now we rebuke every spirit every evil spirit in the name of jesus christ you get glory and honor rather out of this service we do it in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen first thessalonians chapter 4 we'll begin reading with verse 13. first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words and you can be seated if you like amen we come off last week uh actually the last couple of services really on speaking of the rapture being a and this is the rapture this uh the title the message today if we do that uh this is the rapture part three this is the third part of it of course the first couple of parts we've really majored mostly in the revelation of the of the rapture the rapture being at revelation faith being a revelation and that faith and what that faith is and the faith that speaks back to us as christians as believers as we hear that word and have that word spoke back to us and of the word that that word speak to our hearts as that word speaks to our hearts if you're born again and have the holy spirit as that word speaks it becomes revealed to you because it becomes real and as it becomes real we become more like what we are becoming or molding into the image of which is the word which is jesus christ so we're molding into that very image to be that likeness of jesus for the invisible union that is taking place between christ and the bride that that that that appointed time when that last one comes and god's appointed time brings that bride together under the auspice of the shed blood of christ in the image of christ to a place as we like to call the rapture the catching away i believe as we've seen as mike is saying today that there's that thing that that that's unfolding in our world today is unfolding in our country and those are the things that the lord has revealed to us as we know is bringing us into that very capstone the very point of the top of that of that uh perfect statue of a perfect man of christ coming and capping off that body of course we know that we go to meet the lord in the air but that tapping is what is what this bride is looking to and and and believe that we're so very close to that that we're so very near not the capping but the going away yes amen of the body of christ now the point i want to get to start uh working on today is is waning off the faith a little bit into a different part and there's a lot i wanted to say today but i i felt like in study yesterday i was just gonna have to cut it in in two pieces so we'll just try to start with what we got here and go from there and we'll stop at a certain point and then pick it up again next week but i want to know want us to know that this rapture is only for this gentile bride amen the rapture that we're talking about now is only for the gentile bride now remember we know god has not forgot his chosen god has not forgotten the jews god has not forgotten his people he said never could he forget his people but this rapture this catching away is for the gentile bride only those that are down from the church age from the first day of pentecost all the way down to this alive and remain group as we just read that alive and remain grouped that are still going to be alive the body change for that rapture when this time comes is going to be that group it's going to be all the way through from that time till now but it's only going to be for the bride of jesus christ amen now i want to read the scripture that a very familiar one to us in malachi chapter 4 a very familiar scripture reading to all of us malachi chapter 4 would read verses 5 and 6. amen as you're turning over to malachi 4. amen i want to read read something to you here in the rapture message said now the rapture uh that the rapture that we're talking about listen now this again in the rapture message yuma arizona 1965 the rapture that we are talking about now is only for the bride amen amen it's only for the bride remember the bride said the rest of the dead if not for a thousand years this great rapture he said now if there's not a rapture friends where are we at right if there's not a rapture what are we going to do if there's not a rapture what age are we living in what promise do we have well that's the promise that we do have amen but if there's not one what promise do we have there is going to be a rapture the bride the bible says that there will be we just read it and it will be only for the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out of the church the bride that's been pulled out of the church the very word church means as moses called out as most moses called a nation out of a nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of a church amen and called out of a called out group a called out individual group from a from a called out group amen god is called and he labels her the elect lady the one that is elected the one that is chosen predestined before the foundation of the world and again she is an international bride she's not just in these four walls she's not just into sauna arizona united states this bride is an international bride she's around the world again from the first church age to this church age there will be bride yeah they'll the dead in christ will rise first and the alive and remain group will have a body change and we'll be caught up together to meet the lord in the air amen she is the elect lady the holy spirit is calling that bride out of that church and remember this has been 55 years ago over over 55 years ago a church out of a church members of every denomination making up a bride a bride tree it's in the tapes of the bridegroom the bot the bride coming out called that's the one the bride tree rather is the one that's going to be in the rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones known by god from the beginning amen the elected ones known by god from the beginning amen the spiritual father that is predestined and put the spiritual gene of god in each individual those are the ones that god has chosen those are the ones that will be in this rapture that will be in this uh in this catching away now malachi 4 uh it was difficult to get to malachi 4 without going back to uh first thessalonians to get into a whole another part i wanted to but we'll we'll skirt that because i i i plan to take the lord willing a whole service or maybe more on that shout and that voice in that trunk right amen i really want to get in to break those down a little bit if we can but we'll skirt it just a little bit because malachi 4 5 puts us in that position amen of that shout right praise the lord of that shout we just read about the lord shall descend what first with a shout yeah right amen uh that that is the message amen i don't mean to be contrary but it is the message not a message but the message what's that message that's jesus christ coming to a bride for this last day yes speaking his word letting himself be made known through that word again speaking back and revealing itself to his children amen malachi 4 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord now we know that there's those five comings of that spirit of elijah elijah elisha john the baptist brother branham and revelation 11. but so many times even in schofield notes here he gets those things scrupled up a little bit because in the header of i've got here that elijah he's referring to revelation 11. but what he's skipping is the the elijah that's to come at the end of the day before the great and dreadful day of the lord notice this the bible says that this elijah is to come before the great and dreadful day of the lord right amen not after but before and that elijah was to do like verse six said he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that was john the baptist that elijah coming john the baptist that message which is christ speaking forward amen you get that and john the baptist the message of john the baptist was speaking forward it was it was turning the fathers to the children amen so that's a that's a speaking forward that's a bringing a message a truth that's looking forward from the from the fathers to the children amen that was john the baptist jesus told his disciples in matthew 10 that very thing which we might go to in a minute if i don't have it down but we might can go to that and just just lay that out a little bit better but jesus even refers to to malachi 3 and this malachi 4 6 the beginning of it but it's a split scripture as we know many scriptures are malachi 4 6 refers to the beginning refers to john the baptist whose message turned the father's hearts to the children and amen and the heart of the children to their fathers that's the second coming or well technically that would be the fourth coming of that spirit of elijah the second part of this bi uh part of this scripture see because now that message of the last day is to the children of the fathers looking back amen going back to the faith of those fathers see so when john the baptist message was a message preaching forward for the fathers to look unto the children now the message of this last day this malachi 4 5 4 6 the end of it is looking from the children back to the fathers amen to restore back or to bring back from there by their hearts as it says here let's not uh turn the hearts of the children to their fathers well what lies in that heart that heart is the heart of faith that faith is what's being restored amen the faith is being restored back to the children of what was in the apostolic fathers yes as we look uh look back at the apostolic section down through the church ages this last day message was to not give something that was outside the scripture it wasn't to give something in this last stage for a bride that that was that was outside the word it was something of the word that was to bring revelation so that we could grasp the vision of what god has done doing and going to do yes but it's the faith amen the faith remember what he said if if uh that spirit falls a paraphrasing here like it did on the day of pentecost what happened on the day of pentecost when the spirit fell on the day of pentecost those men went out from that upper room and wrote a book of acts with the miracles that happened in their lives with the miracles that took place and and the the the spirit moving and all of the people being filled with the holy ghost and and god's moving and god's spirit being able to move freely amongst the people baptizing him feeling them miracles happening god just that book of that's realizing how that spirit's moving well that same thing was to be restored for this day it was to restore back the faith amen and that's exactly what he did it brought by the word of faith to a bride because remember the word comes when the word speaks when when the word is heard and it here and you hear back from that word is when it reveals itself to you it makes itself known to you see and that's that's where god was to reveal himself through this last day truth to this last day message to unveil the mysteries that were hid from ages and generations so that this bride would have something for this last day that no other age has had because something has got to be accomplished in this last age spiritually that has never been accomplished in every other age and that is a rapture of a group of people amen a rapture of the bride of jesus christ it's not been accomplished from the church of first church age till today but it's going to be it's going to be yes and god's going to accumulate all that up into this last time god's going to take them all together to make up from the again from the feet to the crown of the head make up the body of christ for that rapture yes amen he's bringing them all together thus i believe i believe that this this end time last day bride alive and remain group will hear this message now i know there's people that'll be contrary to that i know there's people that'll disagree with me on that but i believe the bride of jesus christ is going to hear this message the bride that is raptured or alive and remain grouped in this last age that is caught away by a body change is going to hear this word they're going to hear this message they're going to know this word to be the truth they're going to know it because that's what changes them is that word is what changes them now that's not to displace those people back there see because they had when they received their message it put them in that body they were just as predestinated as the rest of us but this last day has got to bring forth a word bride amen and the only way it can bring forth the word bride is if they receive the word of their hour amen and to me that's the only ones that are gonna that are gonna make it so the ones that's going to be there yeah and if you're one of those ones speaking uh parenthetically i guess or uh maybe even rhetorically speaking believing we all are but in a general sense if you are then you then god will lead you that that word will cross your path amen amen that message that truth that word of the hour will come across your path if you were meant to get it every one of us in here today except for maybe the young ones who've heard it from their parents but every one of us adults will say probably have a different story to tell about how we came to know this word to be the truth about how we came into this message and how we come to understand that this prophet was the last a prophet and to know that this word was the word of god that come for this last day to bring a bride to a place of rapturing faith by the word of god we'll probably all have different stories you go around the world and ask different ones you probably have thousands or hundreds of thousands of stories of how different ways god brought each one in yes i remember reading one time or hearing a testimony one time about uh and i think i may have told you this but in a third world country he goes into an open-air restroom to relieve himself and he's sitting there and the only thing to uh uh to to help after relieving himself was a piece of paper it was a half a sheet of paper the end of a book that probably about that size maybe not even that big and at the bottom of that was left what was said at the bottom of that page one page one half a page of a message book people have been using it to wipe themselves with a message book you think oh that's so horrible is so degradable would you put one there if you believed that someone was going to read it and that they were going to get saved because of reading that right i would you say oh i wouldn't do that i wouldn't put the message book there i'd put something else well that little half a page of books saved that man's soul he read that he contacted found out where it came from and and is serving the lord last i heard he was serving the lord filled with the holy ghost from a half a page yeah that's all it took man friend no matter where you are if you belong to him you're going to come to this word you're going to come to this truth you're going to know this and it's going to be revealed to your heart you're going to know it's god doing it because it's god orchestrating it friend there's none of us i don't care what greater novel writer there is could never write a story like this right none of them could have even even remotely enough imagination to write a story that god writes out as he plans it and brings it past in every one of our lives around the world there's not a novelist known to man that could write the stories that god writes right and how this come to pass and how this happens how this comes and brings this out but even the children even the young ones even my children you can raise them in the nurturing admonition of god but friend there comes a time when they've got to do it on their own that's right yes when they have got to accept it for themselves when they have got to be baptized with the holy spirit and fill with the spirit of god amen it has to come their time no matter what we do it's got to be their time and a lot of times even if they're led in that direction they come to it with a different experience yes amen well the difference with my mom and dad yeah but mom and dad can't get you there that's right what happened to you after that point that convinced you or showed you that he was the one that this was the word that this was the truth what was it it was more something it had to be something more mom and daddy that's right yeah it had to be right or you're still lost friend like there had to be a god somewhere that come in and evolved himself in your life to make you know that it was him that was calling you not mom and dad right right amen how many times how many ways thus i will reiterate and i will let tell you my opinion i believe that those who come in and this last day and this this alive remain rapture group is going to come in contact with this word with this message they're going to yes amen they're going to believe it amen that that's that's my uh that's my belief and it i i believe my belief is scripturally based i i believe it's uh founded in the word yeah in the scripture i believe it's the truth now this this word this message uh we'll go to matthew chapter 10 because i just i didn't write this down but i feel like i need to i need to speak this to to back up if if you will uh malachi 4 5 and 6. mostly six malachi 3 we know is the voice of one crying in the wilderness well we know john the baptist identified himself as that part of the scripture as the voice of god crying in the wilderness but what is not told by john the baptist is malachi 4 6. now we know malachi 5 uh we know malachi 4 and 5 could not have been john the baptist because he didn't come before the great and dreadful day of the lord right i mean he came before but 2 000 years before that's not a before amen he did not forerun that great and dreadful day of the lord right that's right that had to be a different elijah well it could be the elijah of revelation 11 because the great and dreadful day of the lord was already in progress and almost drawn to an end right yes because a revelation 11 is is at the towards the end of the tribulation period right well the great and dreadful day of the lord the sixth seal the tribulation breaking out of this world is if that great and dreadful day is before revelation 11. you understand because see this and this gets me into so many things that that take this into a different light but look friend when god when god calls his bride for this last day when god calls this gentile bride he takes her to a marriage supper a wedding supper the wedding supper of the lamb the marriage supper of the lamb of revelation 19. we go to that marriage supper amen at that marriage supper there's three and a half years there according to the scripture of the bride there with the lord jesus well then god then puts her in the palace while he comes back to reveal himself to the jews yes when he comes back to reveal himself to his people yes well that's at the end of the three and a half year tribulation period so this great and dreadful day cannot be this elijah cannot be revelation 11 because that's at the end of the great and dreadful day right this great and dreadful day jesus spoke of it matthew chapter 10 or 17 excuse me it's not matter 17 here we go this is what i'm looking for now the mouth transfiguration is taking place they come out god tells them not to tell this vision to anyone but then in the 10th verse his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall come shall first come so you notice jesus says he will come and restore all things now if he was talking of john the baptist there what did john the baptist restore nothing right john the baptist had one simple task right and that was forerunning and introducing the first christ corporal body on this earth yes that was his only job that was his only task now he did a lot of preaching and he baptized a lot of people but he only baptized them onto repentance the true christian baptism wasn't introduced until acts 2 38. that's right when peter came and said be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so yes john baptized but he just baptized unto repentance right amen his job was to introduce jesus christ and when he did he said i must decrease now so that he increased yes you know where john the baptist ended up in prison got his head chopped off because his job was over he had done what he was supposed to do brother brown talked about him like a wild man coming out with locusts and honey dripping off his beard and he'd preach the dust that the lord gave him and he'd go back in the woods so he said i wish sometimes he said he wished he could do that just live out in the woods and come out like say when i got dust said the lord said thus saith the lord and go back in the woods and that's kind of and that's what john the baptist was right now could you imagine today in our sophisticated religious system that we've got and our big huge beautiful buildings with stained glass windows and and cross crowned steeples that if the man like john the baptist would have walked out of the wilderness here with thus saith the lord and declare it on the six o'clock news do you think anybody would pay that man any attention right the first chance they had they'd throw him in and non-existent mental institution that's exactly what they do they would pay a bit attention to him for nothing but he's the one with thus saith the lord right he is the third spirit of the coming of elijah amen and when they and those but see those who were not ordained to hear that did not hear it only the ones that were ordained to hear john the baptist's message and to accept the first coming of christ are the ones that did they were the only ones listen you know we don't like to put it this way but it's the truth they were the only ones that could hear that's right what john the baptist's message was yes they were the only ones that could hear it but when they saw it and they ran after jesus amen that he said i must decrease now there's people that stay back with john the baptist we know later in the bible they talk about john's disciples even after jesus was there and even after his ministry was going forth there were still people that stayed loyal to john the baptist that's the same thing we got today friend there's people out there that they they bleed brown and blue that's just the fact and that's just the way they're going to be right and and i'm not saying those people don't know or won't be there that's that's up to god that's his decision that's his choice who goes and who don't go that's his choice not mine right that's his decision not mine i don't choose it i just preach what the bible says amen we can draw conclusions about what the bible says but i'll never put anybody in and i'll never take anybody out that's a period i don't care who they are i don't care if they're mass murderers friend they could be sitting there getting ready to hit the electricity and they could repent and that last breath they could repent amen i'll take anybody in oh put anybody in i don't take anybody out that's god's doing right not mine amen but the word tells us exactly how it was supposed to be and jesus tells him yes elijah will come and he is going to restore all things well john the baptist did restore anything he was not a restoration prophet he was a word prophet that come with just said the lord amen and when he introduced jesus he was gone amen when he introduced jesus and and it was all about christ amen should be that way today yes amen it should be that way today it should all be about jesus right it's all about christ amen amen that's the way it should be now let's finish reading elias truly shall first come and restore all things so he couldn't have been talking about john the baptist right right but i say unto you that elias has come already there's another one of those dual scriptures right that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them now he's talking about john the baptist now he's telling him yes there is an elijah coming yes and he's going to restore all things but i'm telling you that elijah has already come and they did whatever they wanted to to him they treated him whatever way they wanted to throwing him in prison chopped his head off and then he said and they'll do the same thing to the son of man jesus they'll do the same thing to me is what he's telling them now then the word says the disciples understood he spoke of john the baptist well the second part of it was but not the first part because john didn't restore anything so you got to keep the scripture running in continuity if it doesn't fit the word it can't it can't work right it doesn't work if it's not scriptural leave it alone yes just like in malachi 4 5 and 6 malachi 6 john the baptist from the from the fathers to the children brother adam from the children to the fathers it was to restore a faith to restore a faith well if that faith got restored restored amen restored then what would that produce well what did it produce the first time a book of acts amen now understand something because a lot of people get that part confused they say well it's going to produce a book of acts and it is that's right it is i contend that it is not will it is producing a book of acts yes if we know enough about what the spirit of god is doing in the world today amongst his children we will say that miracles are taking place and god is producing a book of ox all over again but i want you to understand the differences here in the first church age when they were producing a book of acts they were once again being produced on looking forward that's not what we're doing today the book of acts today is a book of acts that's going to finish this and end it there wasn't an end after the first book of acts there was a continuation the purpose and point of god gathering his children from all over the world by the word of god and the truth of his word and the spirit of god being manifested but in this last day that spirit is lifting off the gentile bride going back to the jews and this book of acts is going to end it not beginning yes and a lot of times we get those two things misunderstood yeah we think would be just exactly like a book of acts no it won't it won't be exactly like the book of acts it'll be a book of acts in theory but it won't be exactly like the book of acts because what they were doing was baptizing people getting filled with the holy ghost and miracles and things taking place and all going forward from the first church age right but friend what's happening today is we're just we're gleaning at best now are there any more souls out there i don't know i believe there is and i'm going to keep preaching and living and witnessing like there are but that's up to the lord but we know that this end time is coming down to a time to where the door on the ark is going to be shut yes and there'll be no more souls can get in or out yeah oh everybody be going on like normal right just like they were with noah in the flood when god shut the door it was a whole seven days before anything ever happened yes people are going to their jobs just like they normally do going about their daily business probably see the ark over the side and they might yell out of explicitly to to knowing his family or or or make fun of them or laugh or joke at them oh no where's the rain today i'm off to work i gotta go do my daily business but noah you look silly in that ark aren't you hot in there i tell you what friend if we were hot if we were in there this week we would have been hot brother roger dug a ditch friday it was hot it's been hot all week but we're still alive we still made it there's still air conditioning and power so we we made it again much as we all love it tongue and cheek but can you imagine sitting in the ark there and these people coming by making fun and laughing at it maybe even some come even like the bible says when the rain started no let us in i can't let you in the gods shut the door i can't open it amen but there's a period of time where life's going to continue to go on and everything's going to be just like normal the bride's going to be sealed into the kingdom and there's no more souls going to be saved at that point amen no more souls personally i think i've told you all this personally i believe that's going to be the period of time between when the dead in christ rise and we actually go to meet the lord of the air that's my opinion now it may already be underway i don't know you can listen to brother brown on tape but he says could it already be yes right but we don't know and that's 60 years ago yes could it be could it be now it could be i don't think so i hope it's not but it could be whether it is there isn't there's going to be a time and you see that's the time that we're in now we're not in the first church age anymore we're not in that book of acts this is a finishing up book of acts this is a this is a spark of faith like the book of acts that's going to take a a bride into a body change for a rash and end it that's going to end right there the gentile dispensation done yes when this bride leaves the gentile dispensation is done my wife even remarked this morning and you probably feel the same way and have felt the same thing at that spirit of god moving off the bride lifting off the bride as we see god's still moving in our midst and all the things that he does for us but it just isn't what it used to be friend it's not what it's not what it was when i first came into this when i first started preaching 33 34 years ago it was nothing like it is today nothing like it is i was telling my wife yesterday we've seen the rise in the fall of the mall the shopping mall people don't hardly go to them anymore i remember when they were first being built used to be the time that that was the only place people went to shop that was the number one the premier place you went to shop but now it's like non-existent anymore oh we have one here and there but at the foothills mall's basically gone el connie is gone his shopping centers amen it's just that the the changing of the times is so fast anymore so drastic amen we've seen the disappearance of the woman bun and the appearance of the quote-unquote man bun which to me is in contrary terms but anyway right it's it's just how fast things are going how quick things are moving to even now like i said things it's just not like it used to be right and that and it's different in the south i i'll give you that but even when i go back there it's not the same as it knows it's not oh my friend i used to i told i've told you before i used to attend meetings sometimes you know church maybe two or three times this long and be in the back and you couldn't even see the pulpit hardly for the milkiness of the spirit and god's so thick in a place and the moving of the spirit moving i could have started a bobby pin factory of the sisters dancing in the spirit and the bobby pins all over the carpet when church was over amen i've been there i've seen it god's spirit moving god hasn't changed us what's changed amen look we're at that time and that's the point i'm trying to make see we're at that time look what uh look what he said on the attraction on the mountain he's talking about this the spirit that paralyzed parallels uh elijah turning the hearts of the children he's going through that with the malachi 3 and 4. he said now watch in the hearts of the children to the fathers in his second coming which is now we're looking to that second coming of christ which his second coming we always call a coming but but we literally go to meet him amen we know he comes we know he descends but we are raptured up to meet him in the air amen amen a lot of songs i've heard and sang through the years and they just don't have the scriptural validity they used to because it really isn't god is not going to god's not going to ever come put his foot on this earth again until it gets purified cleaned over burned over amen that's a whole other section uh turning the hearts of the children to the fathers in his second coming in the last days that's today he turns back to the apostolic faith again amen apostolic faith again well it's got to be that way it's got to be that faith to cause this bride to go on a rapture so it's now when you bring the faith the word the truth of god all comes and and and comes together it forms that perfect union amen and that perfect union friend is is what i what i wanted to get to next uh we just don't have the time to start into it right now that's a whole other message as we get into it maybe lord willing next week but now notice this as we close this out this message today it's not about arguing quotes it's not about arguing doctrines it's not about who's right and who's wrong it's about restoring faith it's about a word to bring a people back to that same faith that they had then plus the introducing of the mysteries being revealed of the word jesus opening himself to his pride making himself known which oh my wants me to go into that next part so bad jesus revealing himself making himself known to his bride he's not doing it to the world he's doing it to his bride amen a bride and a bridegroom get married they become husband and wife and when they go into the secret chamber they reveal themselves to each other right oh my god i but look before jesus let's just talk about the story of joseph for a moment we know that joseph was sold by his brothers he was put in slavery uh he ascended to the second most powerful person on the earth he was given a gentile bribe by pharaoh and he had half jew and half gentile children and when and when jacob came to uh ephraim and manasseh he crossed his hands for the blessing because the right hand blessing always went to the older son because he received the older son he received that that inheritance that inherited blessing by the right hand to ephraim or manasseh but forget now the older boy when jacob went to bless the boys his hands crossed and jacob tried or uh joseph tried to move his hand said said father father no you've got it wrong because see jacob was blind at this time couldn't see and and he tried to know father you've got your hand on the right hand on the younger boy he says god crossed my hands right that's right yes amen so the blessing went from the tame olive tree to the wild olive tree from the older inherited son to the younger gentile if you will through the cross the blessing left and went from the jew to the gentiles that's right and when joseph went to reveal himself to his brethren he had to dismiss his gentile wife he had to get rid of everything and everybody uh genesis chapter 45. if you want to read it but you know what we can read it i i have a couple more minutes genesis 45 1. but joseph had to dismiss his gentile wife he had to put her in a separate chamber before he could reveal himself to his brethren jesus has got to take his bride into a rapture and have a wedding supper with her amen and at the end of the wedding supper he is to pull her away and he comes down to his children to the jews and he reveals himself to them and we've said this many times they look at him and they lament and they warn and they say where do you get those scars he said in the house of my friends their eyes are open remember what the block was that kept the children of israel from seeing jesus you remember what we told you what was the block what was the what was the film that was drawn over the the jews eyes so they didn't see him when he came the first time they were looking for him in a different way right their mind was so fixated on what god was going to do by the torah that they completely missed their their savior coming out of the doorpile right they were so blinded by their own ambitions and by their own doctrines oh god's got to do it this way no he doesn't he's only got to do it according to what his word says he's going to do it not your interpretation of the word not your vision of the word not what you think the word says or anybody or any doctor of divinity he's going to do it the way he wants to do it yes he's going to do it when he does when he does and how he wants to do it that's his choice amen i just want to believe him i just i just want to be ready and i want to be one of the ones he does the two yeah but when he dismisses them then he comes and reveals himself to his brother and they finally they have no inhibitions anymore they have no vision of what it's supposed to be or what's going to take place all that is gone because we've gone through the tribulation period in revelation 11 and they realized they had crucified the very messiah that they had been looking for yes oh my but friend they're going to be reconciled then that's their reconciliation once they see him they'll be reconciled the bride will be tucked away she's already gone to rapture three and a half years earlier she's already in the chamber see amen but look in in genesis 45 1 then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried caused every man he says to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brother amen that's why that's why the spirit of god is lifting off the gentiles yes amen yes yeah probably answered that 60 years ago or more that it was lifting then if it was lifting then where is it today but it's going back to identify itself with the jews and god begins to work with the jews the jews will accept the message the jews will receive the message but who is the message the message is christ christ is the word that is the message i think sometimes people got so confused to think that that the jews were going to receive brother branham's message brother branham's message wasn't for the jews it was for the that elijah calling wasn't to be sent for the jews it was sent for the gentiles that wasn't for what they were supposed to receive but they're going to receive the message and the message is jesus christ amen and they will receive it yes sir amen no way by me or you they will receive it yes they will believe it amen amen oh friend it becomes so beautiful clear how god works his work and how scruple up people can get how what do we say a couple weeks ago how misunderstood right people can become just by a simple tweaking of something quote or scripture or something or misunderstanding or misinterpretation you want to talk about misunderstanding what do you think is going to happen to this in this message when brother billy paul passes away what do you think's going to happen now look me personally and i hope you too aren't hinging on billy paul being an old man right no i'm not you know why because he is an old man i don't know how much older than 83 84 you have to be to be considered old that's old scripturally and that's old naturally remember one thing when brother brown went beyond the curtain of time who's the first one he saw sharon rose right she didn't recognize her i was your little sharon rose on the earth all praise the lord mom's waking up waiting for you up at the house amen this chair that got repossessed in there and dog is it's all in there all that he loved but dad i'm gonna go down here and wait for billy paul wait for billy paul now if billy was going i'm sorry and i hope i don't offend anybody on this video or but if he was supposed to make the rapture as alive and remain why would sharon rose go wait for him wouldn't she see him in the rapture as one of the dead that would raise first and appear unto many yeah exactly wouldn't she i would think so who else is left here if if she resurrected who else would be lived here that's alive here that would go to but she'd go to billy paul just like our son would go to my go to my wife or us if we're together i think he'd go to her first but amen that's this is father's day so i'm gonna he's gonna come to me first today only special he's gonna come and beat her but every other day is mother's day but wouldn't that be the way i mean just imagine i'm not preaching doctrine here and i'm not trying to talk into something or produce something that's you know this is not anything our salvation or the rapture's hinged on that's just my opinion that's just my feeling but what would what would happen if or when that does happen because there's people i'll tell you it's out there that will they will fight you to the death that billy paul is not an old man because of that testimony that's not even on tape i believe it but it's not even on pain amen so we're not here arguing doctrines we're not the message didn't come to argue doctrines it didn't come to to fuss about a quote here and there amen scruple things up but what all does that do right all we we know all that does is create confusion right right amen all it does is create confusion and and i and i don't say this to create confusion right amen i don't want there to be any confusion out there and those people who believe that and feel that way god bless them i love them they're my brothers i pray and trust we all go together right amen i just happen to see it a little differently than they do right when will billy paul not be an old man in the resurrection praise the lord yes amen i don't know praise the lord anyway joseph revealing himself to his brothers and he second verse and he wept aloud the egyptians the house of pharaoh heard and joseph said to his brother i am joseph that my brother my father yet live and his brother could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence jose and you go and read zechariah into different places you'll see a lot of the same that happened to joseph actually does happen at that time when god when jesus reveals himself to his brother and joseph said unto his brother come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt now therefore be not greed nor angry with yourselves can you just imagine that you saw me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life whose life did he preserve because they were blind because they did do what they did to to him he could preserve life amen life of millions down through the church ages yes up to this last time that culminates in this rapture all that life was preserved because of what they did now the sins got to be reconciled and it will be we've read that we talked about that a few weeks ago it will be and they realize what they did and they repent and put on sackcloth and ashes and they repent amen and and then they realize who what they did they realized that they crucified their very messiah amen next i want to focus on that invisible union amen amen that invisible union still a little controversial for some people and maybe some things i see differently than some people see it and i can't help that right uh i just preach it the way the lord shows it to me and um and you know that's all i can say that's all i can say that's all i mean amen the lord shows it and he vindicates it by his word and that's where i stand that's what i believe amen joseph revealed himself to his brothers he dismissed his gentile bride amen this bride's going into rapture friend and at the end of the wedding supper he's going to come and reveal himself to his to his brother amen to his to to his friends to the jews you know might have sang that song and uh i'm not going to get into that but that song i was listening to one time coming down from the mountains uh spoke to me one time because i began to wonder uh i'm closing here as i begin to wonder um how could we be children and a wife you ever thought of that how are we a bride and a children at the same time my bride is right there my children are right here they're completely separate different individuals right amen you ever thought about that i did oh it came on my heart so thick that and i was coming down and i heard that song because of the words in the song son go get your children my children i don't know how the words go and then it and then it hit where the children of god but were the bride of jesus christ amen now you don't separate them into two individuals they're still the one person right amen but just like brother baron said i'm a person i'm a human i'm a i'm a husband i'm a father but it's just me right amen god is god father son holy ghost he is god amen i'm human being i'm i'm father i'm son i'm i'm i'm a husband but see i don't i don't serve the same purpose to my children as i serve to my wife i don't serve the same purpose to my wife or my children as i do to my grandchildren i don't serve the same purpose and then that i serve years faster than this church right you understand and it becomes so clear i thought praise the lord that's it that's how we are bright and children at the same time we're the children of god we're the bride of jesus christ amen let's stand if we could amen amen you love the lord jesus yes yes praise the lord with all my heart he's so good to us isn't he listening is 369 before we go today praise the lord 369. i'll fly away you might not even need to turn to it if you know it good old christian fundamental gospel song here i'll fly away 369. let's sing with all
