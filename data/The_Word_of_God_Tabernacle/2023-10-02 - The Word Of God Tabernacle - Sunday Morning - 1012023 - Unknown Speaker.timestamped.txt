[24:23] Lord in prayer now take up their prayer
[24:25] requests the only requests I have gotten
[24:26] this morning is uh sister Norma sent me
[24:29] a text earlier for her Aunt Wanda uh she
[24:33] has cancer and she's
[24:40] and she heard her with her back
[24:43] she hurt her back she's having a hard
[24:46] time right now so please remember
[24:49] sister Norma's Aunt Wanda in prayer
[24:52] especially
[24:53] this cancer of course the back is one
[24:56] thing and
[24:58] I remember the sad part is
[25:03] talk to you several times and mention my
[25:06] sister but
[25:09] you know when you got cancer it just
[25:12] takes that one little thing and then all
[25:14] of a sudden it just
[25:15] spirals downhill from there just
[25:17] drastically if anybody's ever had a
[25:20] personal experience with someone that
[25:22] had cancer
[25:24] they can have it have it have it and
[25:25] then all of a sudden something will
[25:27] happen like this and I'm not saying she
[25:29] is we're gonna pray for her here but
[25:31] they seem to just spiral down at that
[25:34] point and it just in no time it's over
[25:38] I remember we went visited my sister my
[25:41] mom called and said that she was doing
[25:42] really bad and we got there and we went
[25:46] to visit for Thanksgiving and
[25:48] time with the kids and they were trading
[25:51] her wigs out and taking silly pictures
[25:53] and they went bowling and they did all
[25:56] this stuff it's like wow you know you
[25:57] think this is just this is my sister of
[26:00] old she's just gonna keep going and
[26:01] going and that was Thanksgiving
[26:03] passed Before Christmas
[26:06] because it was right after that
[26:08] um
[26:09] just it went right after that but amen
[26:13] we're just going to trust the Lord in
[26:14] his Divine wisdom to move on to Sister
[26:16] Norman's Aunt Wanda right now amen for
[26:19] this situation amen sister Shelia wrote

[31:21] there's things in our lives that we know

[34:09] [Music]
[34:14] [Music]
[34:16] our brother is he brings forth your word
[34:20] let us not be here to warm in a state or
[34:24] just having something to do but let our
[34:28] hearts hunger and thirst for your
[34:31] righteousness so it shall be filled let
[34:33] us be fed then as we leave this morning
[34:38] we'll be like the ones that you walk
[34:41] with in the world of Emmaus yes that our
[34:44] hearts burn within us amen thank you
[34:47] Lord along the way this morning in your
[34:50] name we pray may the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:54] amen amen amen praise the Lord you could
[34:57] be seated if you'd like testimony amen
[35:01] I wanted to say
[35:04] um that
[35:06] uh
[35:08] Joel appreciate your prayers for Joel he
[35:10] did so good last Sunday
[35:13] uh just fantastic I mean for for a kid
[35:16] that
[35:18] Barrett doesn't have drums only time he
[35:21] plays is when he goes for his lessons
[35:24] and to get up in front of all those
[35:26] people and do what he did Sunday was
[35:28] such a real blessing he's so good you
[35:30] just see that the Lord has his hand on
[35:32] him there's a talent there and he was
[35:35] nervous you could tell he was he was
[35:37] very nervous but he did
[35:39] exceptionally well
[35:40] I was so proud of him so thank you for
[35:43] your prayers amen appreciate that uh it
[35:46] also brings me to a point I wanted to
[35:48] mention or ask would anyone have an
[35:50] objection not that Joel is like anywhere
[35:53] near playing them yet but anyone have an
[35:55] objection if I bring my drums and put
[35:57] them in the corner
[35:59] set them up in here you know
[36:03] um
[36:04] they'll probably just sit there for now
[36:08] unless or until he gets the point in
[36:10] time that uh uh he can play them or just
[36:14] keep a rhythm that's that's what I've
[36:16] been trying to tell him the whole time
[36:17] he's just in church we just
[36:20] we just that's that's the only thing
[36:21] really my opinion that's about the only
[36:25] purpose drum Servant Church is you just
[36:27] you they're just there to keep beat
[36:29] they're not turned they're not to turn
[36:31] church service into a rock concert or a
[36:34] jazz show there to keep a beat to get a
[36:37] nice steady beat and
[36:39] um and it's just nice that someone wants
[36:42] to share their talent with others and I
[36:44] appreciate Micah and Zach and their
[36:46] talents the Lord bless them with and
[36:48] they're extremely talented in what they
[36:50] do and then I feel blessed to have a
[36:52] look
[36:54] on both sides of new year but
[36:56] um if it does get to that point and so I
[36:59] want to make sure before I put them up
[37:01] there's any objection so if everybody's
[37:03] okay with that
[37:05] might operating the whole thing in but
[37:06] some and put it in the corner over there
[37:09] maybe if he gets a chance he can come
[37:12] out and practice a little bit from time
[37:13] to time and we'll see how that goes so
[37:16] amen but I appreciate your prayers about
[37:19] that anyone else have a testimony
[37:20] anything
[37:21] yeah
[37:22] yes
[37:23] um
[37:24] we have a box turtle and he has a lot of
[37:29] Personality he'll come up to you and
[37:30] stick out his neck
[37:32] we hadn't seen him in a week and you
[37:34] know I have ring and I get notices of
[37:37] different things going on in the
[37:38] neighborhood and one guy reported that
[37:41] there's a loose box turtle in his
[37:44] property and we hadn't seen him and Leah
[37:48] has she admitted that she leaves the
[37:51] garage door open and then The Little
[37:53] Door going into the garage and and being
[37:57] that we didn't see him as
[37:59] ran down to that neighborhood was
[38:01] looking for him and when she got back
[38:03] she says I I didn't find him I said what
[38:07] makes you think it's him he might be
[38:09] buried so we look under the bush we look
[38:11] where he would we couldn't find any
[38:13] signs that he was around so I told her
[38:16] let's pray amen ask the Lord that he'll
[38:19] come out and he'll show himself amen and

[39:02] we've been watching the YouTube trying
[39:04] to learn things I don't know we're so
[39:06] old they don't need to do early but
[39:08] we're in uh I see you we watch the
[39:13] stories of the Bible and uh
[39:17] and the studies and things and and I'm
[39:19] just I think the Lord speaking to me uh
[39:26] is the revelations are
[39:28] are Revelations from God they're
[39:31] learning that he's turned loose even for
[39:34] all the knowledge that we go to the moon
[39:37] or whatever yeah it puts it in people's
[39:40] mind to be able to do this and to go
[39:43] ahead and do it and
[39:44] uh different things they studied
[39:49] they studied
[39:51] Bible and things that I've already
[39:53] studied so I was interested and I live I
[39:55] listened close up

[40:09] been made in
[40:11] the the
[40:13] Christian uh followings and and the
[40:18] Jewish followings and and I think all
[40:21] these things are Revelations of where
[40:24] God has already got it in his Bible and
[40:26] he just helps explain it to him and let
[40:28] him understand all of a sudden they see
[40:31] it oh wow I know I can see that you know
[40:34] and find out what year it is you know
[40:36] why that well here we are in this
[40:38] present time it's just so far from

[51:00] power his forward of prayer if we could
[51:03] Lord Jesus father God we're so very
[51:05] thankful your grace and mercy to us Lord
[51:08] thank you for the opportunity to be in
[51:10] your house one more time lord we don't
[51:12] know but what this might be the last
[51:14] Gathering we ever have we'll never meet
[51:16] like this again Lord and one day that'll
[51:18] be the truth and Lord we do truly
[51:21] believe as a as a body of Believers that
[51:24] that is so real God so real to us in
[51:27] this day that we live lord it's not just
[51:29] something we say we truly believe that
[51:31] this could be be the very last time that
[51:34] we meet like this Lord we just pray God
[51:36] that you're going to help us Lord now
[51:38] do the remaining part of this service
[51:40] that all that we could do for you God as
[51:43] you would speak to us from your word
[51:45] help us Lord through the revealing of
[51:47] this word to draw closer to you Lord you
[51:50] open your word to us once again and show
[51:53] us in there what you'd have us to see
[51:55] and know God we're we're a needy people
[51:57] today father is evident Lord by the
[52:00] prayer requests and the things that we
[52:02] know in our lives our families and
[52:03] different ones Lord God that we are a
[52:06] needy people today but trusting you
[52:08] father for all things because you bring
[52:10] and do everything that is good and right
[52:13] you make all things work together for
[52:15] our good Lord because we love you Lord
[52:18] thank you for this word thank you for
[52:20] the ability to turn back the pages of
[52:22] this word and expect you once again to
[52:25] speak to us from it to meet us here Lord
[52:28] we rebuke every demonic spirit that
[52:30] would try to hurt hinder and filtrate
[52:32] this service in any way God that you
[52:35] would get the glory honor and praise for
[52:37] all that is said and done now may it
[52:39] accomplish that that you send it forth
[52:41] for now as we committed to you in the
[52:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[52:45] amen amen
[52:47] amen Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 we'll
[52:50] read this one scripture and let you be
[52:52] seated
[52:54] at that time Jesus answered and said I
[52:56] thank the old father Lord of Heaven and
[52:58] Earth because thou has hid these things
[53:00] from the wise and prudence and has
[53:03] revealed them unto uh unto babes amen
[53:07] you could be seated if you like
[53:10] Amen Kid and revealed in the same
[53:15] mechanism amen God hiding himself and
[53:18] revealing himself in the same that is
[53:21] the Simplicity of who God is
[53:24] amen we went into the realization I
[53:28] truly believe that uh if if it's if if a
[53:32] God is going to hold accountable
[53:36] uh someone as young as 12 years old that
[53:38] brother Branham talked about the age of
[53:40] accountability 12 13 14. I believe it
[53:43] should be at the point that a person of
[53:45] that age should be able to grasp
[53:47] understand and believe the revelation of
[53:50] God's word to be saved to be born again
[53:52] to take God's word and for that word to
[53:56] work in their lives amen it doesn't take
[53:58] them
[53:59] a chemical engineer it doesn't take
[54:02] someone of uh a degree of 16 years of
[54:06] their walls plaster of the paper it's
[54:09] just something that God simply reveals
[54:11] to his children something that God in
[54:13] Simplicity shows himself to us
[54:15] recognizing that it is him a lot of
[54:18] times if you can see it and it is
[54:21] something that's that is brought in that
[54:24] simplistic of a way you can pretty well
[54:26] believe that that is God Amen because
[54:28] man complicates things but God doesn't
[54:31] amen Men actually tried as we read last
[54:34] week Men actually try to complicate God
[54:36] Amen and to others they do complicate
[54:39] God but God himself is not complicated
[54:42] amen amen God is not hard to find God
[54:45] has got not hard to understand amen God
[54:47] is not hard to get a revelation from
[54:49] amen our ability and our letting go of
[54:53] ourselves enough to believe amen amen
[54:56] now let's go back over to Revelation
[54:58] chapter 12. uh we delved into last week
[55:02] amen which oddly enough and unbeknownst
[55:04] to me uh brother zeph did last week uh
[55:08] read from Revelation 12 as well and I
[55:10] want to go back to the seventh verse now
[55:12] last week or last time we spoke uh we
[55:16] went to the first verse and went through
[55:18] of the Heavenly uh Gatherings of these
[55:21] symbols that are in the scripture that
[55:22] brother Branham teaches us through these
[55:24] the Sim uh the symbols of the word like
[55:28] even through Revelation 5 and the seals
[55:30] and them they're just symbols that there
[55:32] is something that God reveals that is
[55:35] based on that so so we went through
[55:37] those things about the woman the Jews
[55:39] the Orthodox church and the new is the
[55:42] new gospel church coming forth and the
[55:46] uh the law going away Grace coming in
[55:48] amen and uh the 12 apostles but and of
[55:52] course Christ being born Herod there
[55:54] waiting to destroy Christ as soon as he
[55:57] was born but now I want to go back to
[55:59] the seventh verse and talk about this
[56:01] this war again
[56:03] amen and what that war meant uh as we uh
[56:07] as you read Revelation 12 7
[56:09] amen and what this was now I mentioned
[56:12] this the last time we spoke which I told
[56:14] you was kind of jumping forward to the
[56:16] next message which is today uh brother
[56:19] uh Dennis mentioned in his prayer today
[56:22] uh about Sin beginning in Heaven Sin did
[56:26] not originate here on Earth sin
[56:28] originated in heaven and we read this
[56:30] again because we know that the devil uh
[56:34] as we can go over and find in Isaiah 14
[56:36] where he desired to be like the most
[56:38] high worship like God lifted above God
[56:41] being being worshiped like God that's
[56:43] what this that's what in the in
[56:45] Lucifer's heart he wanted to do when it
[56:48] begins to talk about the dragon the the
[56:51] red dragon the the serpent uh the uh the
[56:56] devil and Lucifers all the same amen so
[57:00] now
[57:01] he preached a message that convinced a
[57:05] third of the angels to believe his
[57:07] message amen and so there was a war in
[57:11] heaven seventh verse Michael and his
[57:14] angels fought against the dragon and the
[57:16] dragon fought and his angels and
[57:19] prevailed not neither was their place
[57:21] found any more in heaven the Great
[57:23] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[57:26] called the devil and Satan which
[57:28] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[57:31] out into the Earth and his angels were
[57:35] cast out with him amen so all of this
[57:40] the devil Lucifer Satan was cast out of
[57:44] Heaven because he was no longer able to
[57:46] be there it says there was no there was
[57:49] no place found anymore well
[57:52] um a casket is not a good place for a
[57:56] living human being
[57:58] amen uh a casket is not a place for a
[58:01] living human being
[58:03] um Jesus never attended a funeral why
[58:06] because if Jesus went to a funeral the
[58:09] man came back to life amen amen when
[58:12] there's no place Mount in heaven that
[58:14] means that heaven is perfect pure holy
[58:18] righteous and any uh inkling to the
[58:22] contrary of that there's no place for
[58:25] that in heaven so because it was no
[58:27] place for evil for deception for for
[58:31] Satan anymore he was cast out and those
[58:34] that believed his message were cast out
[58:36] with him a third of the angels of heaven
[58:39] were cast out with the devil and were
[58:41] cast down into the Earth thou precious
[58:44] Brothers have he mentioned uh the other
[58:46] day about the creation and without form
[58:49] and void and I believe some of
[58:51] schofield's notes goes along that line
[58:53] where it talks about after the creation
[58:56] that Satan was kicked out into his
[58:58] judgment there that turned the earth
[59:00] into without form and void and chaos and
[59:03] and it took the word of God now whether
[59:06] that's true or not we don't absolutely
[59:08] know for sure but uh I I could see what
[59:11] he's talking about I could see how that
[59:13] would absolutely uh be something that
[59:16] would come to pass that God's perfect
[59:18] creation being thrown into chaos by
[59:21] Satan in his is is Fallen Angels coming
[59:25] and doing what they did but then it took
[59:27] the word of God regardless when the
[59:31] Earth was without form and boy Darkness
[59:33] upon the face of thief it took the word
[59:34] of God to come forth and set that Earth
[59:38] that God had created in his perfect
[59:40] proper position amen took the word of
[59:44] God because after the creation it begins
[59:47] in the third verse by saying and God
[59:50] said
[59:51] so it took the word of God in the
[59:54] chaotic state that it was in it took the
[59:57] word of God to bring this Earth back
[59:59] into the perfect or into the perfect
[1:00:01] place that it was meant to be in God's
[1:00:04] mind God had the creation in his mind
[1:00:07] before he created it and when he created
[1:00:10] it he created it the way he wanted it
[1:00:12] but when it was in a chaotic State there
[1:00:15] had to be something that caused it to
[1:00:18] form into the image that God saw in his
[1:00:21] mind now when God had you in his mind
[1:00:24] and and and in his mind you were to come
[1:00:28] into this Earth and a predetermined time
[1:00:30] way uh purpose in his mind you you were
[1:00:34] that perfect being because you were the
[1:00:36] attribute of God Amen you were the
[1:00:38] thought of God and there's not a thought
[1:00:40] of God that comes out of him that's not
[1:00:42] perfect and righteous and holy and
[1:00:45] exactly the way that God informed it or
[1:00:48] desired for it to be but when we come
[1:00:50] into this Earth we come into this word
[1:00:52] uh uh uh in sin-shaped iniquity speaking
[1:00:57] Lies We Came in a way that was chaotic
[1:01:00] we came to this earth in a way that was
[1:01:03] dark and and without form and without
[1:01:05] anything good
[1:01:07] amen you don't have to teach a baby to
[1:01:09] lie it's inherent in them because of the
[1:01:12] nature that they're born in that
[1:01:13] situation amen but it takes the word of
[1:01:16] God it takes the word and what is the
[1:01:19] word because this is the part I want to
[1:01:21] get to today amen a word is a seed a
[1:01:25] word is a seed that gets planted
[1:01:27] amen that's why it's very important to
[1:01:29] know what you listen to yeah to
[1:01:32] understand what you listen to Because
[1:01:33] those seeds get planted and if it's the
[1:01:37] wrong seed friend and it's planted in
[1:01:39] you it will come to its place of
[1:01:41] maturity yeah cause a seed in the right
[1:01:44] ground the right atmosphere it will
[1:01:46] mature to the place that it that it was
[1:01:48] intended to of what is inside the seeds
[1:01:51] you got to be very careful uh what you
[1:01:54] listen to what word you listen to who
[1:01:55] you hear preaching I'm not telling you
[1:01:57] who to and not to that's up to you I'm
[1:02:00] just saying that we all have to be very
[1:02:02] careful about what we who we listen to
[1:02:05] amen as far as the word goes because the
[1:02:07] word is a seed and it took the word of
[1:02:10] God to go forth on this Earth the low
[1:02:12] Gospel of God to come forth and root
[1:02:14] over this Earth to form it and to shape
[1:02:16] it and to make it exactly into the
[1:02:18] beautiful place that God intended it be
[1:02:21] to begin with
[1:02:22] but now on our theme God said God said
[1:02:26] God said light uh Darkness it was seeds
[1:02:30] it was a a botany life animal life human
[1:02:33] life but let's go to the 11th verse
[1:02:36] uh still Genesis 1 11
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:42] because there's just this particular
[1:02:44] part again like I said I I want to focus
[1:02:46] on uh for this morning
[1:02:49] Genesis 1 11.
[1:02:53] amen and God said let the Earth bring
[1:02:57] forth grass
[1:02:59] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[1:03:02] tree yielding fruit after his kind amen
[1:03:06] so again as we know
[1:03:08] inside of body life God placed in that
[1:03:12] botany life that the ability to
[1:03:15] reproduce itself amen the seed inside
[1:03:20] that botany life was placed there by God
[1:03:23] for it to reproduce itself amen
[1:03:30] amen and it was so after his condescene
[1:03:33] is in itself upon the Earth it was
[1:03:35] soaked and the Earth brought forth grass
[1:03:38] and the herb yielding seed after his
[1:03:41] kind
[1:03:42] and the tree yielding fruit
[1:03:45] amen the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[1:03:48] was in itself after his time and God saw
[1:03:53] that it was good
[1:03:54] amen so inside each one of these botany
[1:03:58] live animal life and human life was seed
[1:04:02] to be able to reproduce of its own kind
[1:04:05] amen a cumin seed doesn't produce a pig
[1:04:10] a dog seed doesn't produce uh an aloe
[1:04:13] plant amen
[1:04:16] an orange seed doesn't produce a man
[1:04:21] amen an orange seed produces an orange
[1:04:23] amen so the seed of God produces one
[1:04:27] thing
[1:04:28] God the seed of God can only produce one
[1:04:31] thing because the seed of God is exactly
[1:04:34] what in it is God
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:40] and when your seed is planted
[1:04:43] and it Finds Its bedding ground it only
[1:04:45] reproduces what it is amen God saw this
[1:04:48] that it was good but now look
[1:04:51] and remember Satan sin began in heaven
[1:04:56] cast out on the Earth
[1:04:58] and as he was cast on in this earth you
[1:05:01] know he's going to do everything you can
[1:05:03] to continue to sow his seed like he did
[1:05:06] in heaven he's going to continue to try
[1:05:09] to disrupt all of the perfect order that
[1:05:12] God had said in order on Earth just like
[1:05:15] he did in heaven
[1:05:16] Satan is always to this very day Satan
[1:05:20] is always and still is looking for
[1:05:24] someone that he can work in yeah he's
[1:05:27] trying to find some way to get in
[1:05:29] someone so that he can work through that
[1:05:32] person
[1:05:34] and when God and when Satan was cast on
[1:05:37] this Earth he realized he couldn't get
[1:05:39] to God's perfect creation through botany
[1:05:41] mine he just couldn't do it
[1:05:45] um a fern Bush doesn't speak
[1:05:48] a cactus doesn't talk
[1:05:52] uh a cactus uh a pine tree can't have
[1:05:55] relations with a human
[1:05:57] it can't happen amen
[1:06:00] so he found the one person
[1:06:03] now forgive me for this but he found the
[1:06:06] one person in God's evolutionary scale
[1:06:10] yes I did say that word
[1:06:12] because God is an evolution it's just
[1:06:14] not the way the scientists say he is
[1:06:16] right amen amen you can understand that
[1:06:19] God continuously evolved his creation
[1:06:22] even from the first time that he spoke
[1:06:24] amen right he created botany life then
[1:06:27] he created animal life then he created
[1:06:29] human life well in whatever measure you
[1:06:32] want to measure that with that's an
[1:06:33] evoluting of God in his perfect
[1:06:37] understanding it's his perfect ways I
[1:06:39] should say in God's perfect place so
[1:06:42] Satan understands this
[1:06:45] so in God's way of and his evolutionary
[1:06:48] of creation he created and began with
[1:06:51] botany life and went all the way up to
[1:06:53] the chimpanzee and the and and the
[1:06:56] gorilla the eight and then in between
[1:06:59] there he created a another animal
[1:07:03] and it was called The Serpent right that
[1:07:06] serpent was created as the link between
[1:07:08] the monkey and the man
[1:07:10] that that's that is why to this day that
[1:07:14] evolution in the way that Darwin the
[1:07:16] different ones the scientists believe
[1:07:17] today can still only even though they
[1:07:20] try to teach it like a fact it can only
[1:07:23] be considered to in professional
[1:07:25] documents as a theory right because
[1:07:28] they've been unable to prove it and why
[1:07:30] they've been unable to prove it because
[1:07:31] the serpent is not in his original
[1:07:33] creation as that link between the monkey
[1:07:36] and the man and man himself so smart
[1:07:39] can't see the simplest of it remember
[1:07:42] that time where that man challenged
[1:07:45] brother Branham and the and the Lord
[1:07:47] kept the spirit kept speaking through
[1:07:49] brother random and said tell him it's
[1:07:51] here say we're at that serpent seat he
[1:07:54] said where is it he said tell him it's
[1:07:55] here but where is it he said it's a
[1:07:58] serpent
[1:07:59] amen the spirit of God speaking through
[1:08:02] that Prophet to this unbeliever the
[1:08:04] skeptic of where the where the word of
[1:08:07] God manifests itself even in the world
[1:08:10] today
[1:08:12] but Satan's still looking for someone
[1:08:15] that he can work through looking for a
[1:08:18] vessel that he could find
[1:08:20] he's still trying to find that vessel
[1:08:21] but he found in the Garden of Eden he
[1:08:24] found the one seed the one link that
[1:08:28] connects with the human and the animal
[1:08:30] and that was the serpent seed
[1:08:33] the serpent was be gullible yes the
[1:08:36] serpent was beguiling but he was
[1:08:37] begalable he was able Satan was able to
[1:08:41] use the serpent to get in him to be able
[1:08:44] to spread his seed July to try to bring
[1:08:49] disbelief
[1:08:50] so now we can see us he's found that
[1:08:53] he's looking for a subject as he's found
[1:08:55] the serpent to work and he's looking for
[1:08:57] someone at some place that he can sow
[1:09:00] this seed now
[1:09:01] now he's looking for not just a natural
[1:09:04] seed which he was able to do he's
[1:09:07] looking to sow a spiritual seed
[1:09:10] and the first thing that the devil tries
[1:09:12] to do is to sow a spiritual seed before
[1:09:16] the physical seed ever takes root amen
[1:09:19] amen you notice in the Garden of Eden
[1:09:21] let's just go over to the third the uh
[1:09:24] Genesis 3. we'll just read it again
[1:09:29] thank you
[1:09:33] Genesis 3 1.
[1:09:40] look here now now the serpent was more
[1:09:42] subtle than any beast of the field which
[1:09:44] the Lord God had made and he said unto
[1:09:47] the woman yea have God said ye shall not
[1:09:49] eat of every tree of the garden now he's
[1:09:51] not purposely at this point trying to
[1:09:53] sow a natural seed he's trying to sow a
[1:09:55] spiritual seed remember where did
[1:09:57] Brother Branham say the greatest battle
[1:09:59] ever fought takes place
[1:10:02] it's up here in the mind and that's
[1:10:05] exactly what the serpent Satan threw the
[1:10:08] serpent is trying to get through to Eve
[1:10:10] is trying to get to that greatest battle
[1:10:12] ever fought in her mind to deceive her
[1:10:15] into believing what he's bringing her is
[1:10:18] the truth
[1:10:19] said friend be careful
[1:10:22] what you listen to amen someone may be a
[1:10:25] great Orchard maybe a powerful deliverer
[1:10:28] they may even be anointed but that
[1:10:30] doesn't mean what they're bringing is
[1:10:31] the truth yeah amen you've got to be
[1:10:33] very careful see uh and this serpent
[1:10:36] very very beguiling amen he said unto
[1:10:40] the woman ye shall um uh yay had had God
[1:10:44] said ye shall eat and not eat of every
[1:10:47] tree of the garden again questioning
[1:10:49] God's word the woman said unto the
[1:10:51] serpent we may eat of the fruits of the
[1:10:53] tree of the garden but the fruit of the
[1:10:54] tree which is in the midst of the garden
[1:10:56] God has said ye shall not eat it neither
[1:10:58] shall ye touch it lest she die that's
[1:11:00] God's word in its purest form that's
[1:11:03] exactly what God Said Amen but look with
[1:11:06] the serpent again being being influenced
[1:11:09] of the devil Satan just like he did in
[1:11:12] heaven he's working to do this here now
[1:11:15] in God's children that is here on the
[1:11:18] earth he's trying to do the exact same
[1:11:19] thing he's trying to sow his seed he's
[1:11:22] trying to get his seed now notice you
[1:11:25] cannot
[1:11:26] to to believe that there's a literal uh
[1:11:30] physical Satan scene is wrong
[1:11:34] there's not a physical literal Satan
[1:11:37] seed it's a serpent seed amen that's
[1:11:40] physical literal serpency but there is a
[1:11:44] spiritual seed that is of the devil that
[1:11:47] he continually tries to sow in whomever
[1:11:50] he can find a way to get in amen a
[1:11:53] spiritual seed and he's trying to sow
[1:11:55] that seed and eat he's trying to get his
[1:11:58] seed of doubt and unbelief to the uh to
[1:12:02] Eve the serpent said unto the woman ye
[1:12:05] shall not surely die
[1:12:07] for God doth know that in the day you
[1:12:10] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:12:12] opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing
[1:12:15] good and evil now everything he says the
[1:12:18] truth but it wasn't God's word
[1:12:20] amen it was true what he said happened
[1:12:23] but it wasn't God's word that's not what
[1:12:25] God Said Amen a lot of people a lot of
[1:12:28] times people come up and try to say
[1:12:30] something and and think so well this is
[1:12:33] true and look at this but it's not what
[1:12:35] God's word says
[1:12:37] I will stick with God's word period amen
[1:12:40] it doesn't I whatever anybody else might
[1:12:43] do or say God's word is what I am
[1:12:47] focused on is that's my meat that's my
[1:12:49] life amen regardless of what all the
[1:12:51] other scientists can proven whatever
[1:12:54] it's like I was telling brothers that
[1:12:56] the other day we and I tell every
[1:12:58] brother I take up her sister up to
[1:13:00] Sabino I said you know you'll hear him
[1:13:03] now I didn't listen to it this time
[1:13:06] they don't give you the narration as you
[1:13:08] go up now the used to be the driver
[1:13:10] would narrate and tell you all this
[1:13:12] stuff I got the earphones and you got to
[1:13:14] plug in and listen on your earphones and
[1:13:17] stuff and the driver just drives so it's
[1:13:19] taken kind of some of that human element
[1:13:21] out of it but in that in that that they
[1:13:24] used to tell and I don't know what they
[1:13:26] told because I didn't listen I've
[1:13:28] listened to that a hundred times so I
[1:13:30] didn't listen but as if Brothers have
[1:13:32] listened on the earphone and I told him
[1:13:35] I said you know when you get up here
[1:13:37] close to the top the driver or whoever's
[1:13:41] narrating it now I'll tell you that
[1:13:43] those big rocks over there fell off of
[1:13:46] there uh in this earthquake of 19
[1:13:48] whatever I don't even remember anymore
[1:13:50] some great big earthquake and those
[1:13:52] rocks came loose and fell down now to
[1:13:54] how they knew that I don't know they're
[1:13:56] just speculating probably I said but I
[1:13:59] always tell every brother or sister
[1:14:00] anybody I take up there I said but
[1:14:02] brother green told me and told us if you
[1:14:06] remember that though that brother
[1:14:08] Branham told him that those rocks were
[1:14:11] put in place when Jesus Christ was
[1:14:14] crucified and the Earth did quake and
[1:14:16] the Rocks did rent I said now you can
[1:14:19] believe what the scientists are saying
[1:14:20] but I'll take what the what the prophet
[1:14:23] said amen amen I'll I'll hold to what
[1:14:27] brother Branham said instead of a
[1:14:28] scientist that probably speculating or
[1:14:30] thinking that it fell off in some great
[1:14:32] earthquake no he said those were put in
[1:14:35] place when the Rocks did quake and the
[1:14:37] Earth did rent the Earth that that's
[1:14:39] what I'll take from it so what he's
[1:14:42] saying is true what the serpent is
[1:14:44] telling Eve is true but it's not God's
[1:14:46] word
[1:14:47] you can't leave God's word you've got to
[1:14:49] stay with God's word now would all of
[1:14:52] this come to pass at some point in time
[1:14:55] maybe amen not that it would have ever
[1:14:58] been through the original sin and the
[1:15:00] ACT between the man and the woman but it
[1:15:03] might have come to the place that as of
[1:15:05] the wisdom that that the serpent is
[1:15:08] talking about
[1:15:09] but now look what he found look what
[1:15:12] look what we know what happened
[1:15:14] for God does knowing the day either of
[1:15:16] then your eyes shall be open and you
[1:15:18] shall be as God's knowing good and evil
[1:15:19] so first the spiritual seed was sown
[1:15:23] before the physical seed could be sown
[1:15:27] because remember the battle's up here am
[1:15:30] I amen and once the enemy wins the
[1:15:32] battle up here it takes place in here
[1:15:36] right right amen
[1:15:39] when he won that battle
[1:15:42] in her mind he won that battle in the
[1:15:46] physical sense
[1:15:48] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:15:50] good for food and it was pleasant to the
[1:15:53] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[1:15:56] one wise
[1:15:58] she took which those are some powerful
[1:16:00] apples now I'm telling you uh if we if
[1:16:04] it's apples that make a person wise and
[1:16:07] uh in a day when Common Sense isn't so
[1:16:10] common anymore like I'll say what
[1:16:12] brother Branham said on the Patsy apples
[1:16:14] again amen amen I had some powerful
[1:16:16] fruit though that would make somebody
[1:16:18] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[1:16:22] did eat and gave also unto her husband
[1:16:23] with her and he did eat and the eyes of
[1:16:26] them both were open again plus some
[1:16:28] powerful fruit open their eyes and they
[1:16:31] knew that they were naked
[1:16:33] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[1:16:35] made themselves aprons and I took a
[1:16:37] physical a took a physical a spiritual
[1:16:42] implantation of a seed before a physical
[1:16:45] implantation of a seed could take place
[1:16:47] and of course we know what happens next
[1:16:49] it comes out in the fourth chapter and
[1:16:51] she has twins she has a cane and she has
[1:16:54] an able one is from the seed of the
[1:16:56] serpent amen seated the serpent not the
[1:16:59] seed of Satan the seed of Satan is a
[1:17:02] spirit is a spiritual seed amen
[1:17:05] just like the seed of God is a spiritual
[1:17:08] seed that God put in each one of you
[1:17:10] that spiritual seed that's the Manifest
[1:17:12] and the to come forth as God as God
[1:17:17] manifesting himself on this Earth
[1:17:20] that spiritual seat is the same seed
[1:17:23] that Satan is the same it's a spiritual
[1:17:26] seed that brings forth upon the earth
[1:17:28] now look at this
[1:17:32] this is God of this evil age
[1:17:36] amen talking again about the the seed of
[1:17:39] Satan
[1:17:43] God of this evil age
[1:17:46] we find now this evil age is to prove
[1:17:50] look this is one of my favorite quotes
[1:17:52] out of the
[1:17:54] 100 200 000 quotes that are my favorites
[1:17:57] this is one of my very favorites
[1:18:00] uh now we find this evil age God of this
[1:18:04] evil age Jeffersonville August 1965. we
[1:18:08] find out this evil age is to prove to
[1:18:12] Satan that she who she the bride
[1:18:17] amen God's Pride she is not like Eve
[1:18:22] God's pride is not like Adam's bride she
[1:18:27] is not like Eve that she is not that
[1:18:31] type of a woman
[1:18:32] praise the Lord to FLIR around with all
[1:18:35] these other thoughts denominations
[1:18:37] dogmas doctrines she doesn't flirt with
[1:18:41] all that unbelief and all the uh the
[1:18:43] wisdom of man
[1:18:45] he's not that kind of a woman she holds
[1:18:48] to God's word in God's word alone
[1:18:50] because who seed is in her
[1:18:54] praise God because she she belongs to
[1:18:57] God amen amen
[1:18:59] praise the Lord she's not that kind of a
[1:19:01] woman so we are here what I read from
[1:19:04] that is we are here as the Bride of
[1:19:07] Jesus Christ to prove to Satan amen
[1:19:11] first and foremost
[1:19:12] prove to Satan that we this bride is not
[1:19:16] like Eve amen I'm not going to fall we
[1:19:19] don't fall for all this uh altering of
[1:19:22] the word or or some man's idea of it or
[1:19:25] or hydrating it in some way or
[1:19:27] interjecting our own thoughts opinions
[1:19:29] ideas we are not like this Eve we
[1:19:32] believe God's word and we're going to
[1:19:34] hold to it until our last breath because
[1:19:36] it is Who We Are
[1:19:38] amen it is Who We Are
[1:19:42] praise God
[1:19:45] and she will be tried who is that she we
[1:19:49] us
[1:19:50] we the bride she will be Tried by his
[1:19:54] word
[1:19:55] the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by
[1:19:58] the word Adam's bride failed
[1:20:01] seed was sown it corrupted her amen and
[1:20:06] it had to take a Son of God a pure Son
[1:20:09] of God Adam to go down to Redeemer is
[1:20:11] the only way that it's the only way that
[1:20:13] she found redemption or salvation is
[1:20:15] through her husband going down and
[1:20:17] becoming what she was
[1:20:19] it's the only way amen and Adam's Pride
[1:20:23] believed every bit of the word all but
[1:20:26] confused on One Promise they used the
[1:20:29] same yesterday today and forever see
[1:20:32] but failed on One Promise under the
[1:20:34] temptation of the enemy face to face
[1:20:37] and now the people that's called for his
[1:20:39] name of course is his bride
[1:20:43] she is to come in contact Again by the
[1:20:47] same thing
[1:20:48] seed of God the word of God
[1:20:51] praise the Lord not by denominational
[1:20:54] truth or something but by every word
[1:20:58] for in the beginning of the Bible man
[1:21:01] was given the word of God to live by
[1:21:03] one word one word
[1:21:06] misinterpreted by a man called Satan or
[1:21:09] the serpent in a person of an animal
[1:21:12] called The Serpent
[1:21:14] Satan in this person could talk to Eve
[1:21:18] and misinterpret the word to her and was
[1:21:21] lost so seeing he says it must be by
[1:21:26] every word
[1:21:27] amen every word every word is a seed of
[1:21:32] God Amen that's that's planted in the
[1:21:36] individual the seeds of the serpent the
[1:21:40] seeds of Satan were sown in Eve and she
[1:21:43] believed it praise the Lord the Bible
[1:21:46] says that she was in the transgression
[1:21:50] not Adam
[1:21:51] amen she was in the because she she
[1:21:55] believed this to be the truth look here
[1:22:00] again God of this evil age
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:12] hello God this evil a same message
[1:22:15] and notice he preached the serpent Satan
[1:22:20] through the serpent
[1:22:22] preached that kind of scientific
[1:22:25] social
[1:22:27] educated
[1:22:29] Progressive gospel to eat
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:34] same scientific
[1:22:37] social
[1:22:39] educated Progressive gospel to Eve
[1:22:43] and then in every one of those facets
[1:22:47] people take and complicate god with to
[1:22:49] be
[1:22:51] amen it's like I said last time saying
[1:22:54] it's it's no more than an equality it's
[1:22:56] in spirit right that's really good to
[1:22:58] try to complicate God is no more than
[1:23:00] than a nicolaitan spirit to try to
[1:23:03] project to the people that the priest
[1:23:05] knows the preacher knows the pastor
[1:23:08] knows more than you know you've got to
[1:23:10] listen to me to even come close to try
[1:23:12] to figure it out and you'll probably
[1:23:13] never figure it out anyway like we have
[1:23:16] oh it's just a nickel dance in spirit
[1:23:18] it's like a Catholic Church keeping the
[1:23:21] Bible from the uh from from children of
[1:23:24] God back in the dark ages to try to keep
[1:23:27] the word away from them
[1:23:29] amen it's it it's the same spirit
[1:23:35] preached
[1:23:36] that kind of scientific every one of
[1:23:39] these science science will take you as
[1:23:41] far farther from God you can think
[1:23:43] social
[1:23:44] educated educational take you a million
[1:23:47] miles from God Progressive gospel how
[1:23:49] many people here today talk about a
[1:23:51] progressive gospel
[1:23:52] now I know in me I've grown in the Lord
[1:23:56] but that doesn't mean the gospel has
[1:23:58] progressed right
[1:24:00] right that doesn't mean that God has
[1:24:03] changed
[1:24:04] hey may God still the same
[1:24:06] I might see some things differently than
[1:24:09] I used to but the gospel is the same
[1:24:12] gospel
[1:24:13] I might know more of it you might know
[1:24:16] more believe more of it and being
[1:24:17] revealed but the but the gospel itself
[1:24:19] is the same
[1:24:21] God has not changed so the belief of
[1:24:23] progressive gospel is just to think that
[1:24:25] God has changed God's doing something
[1:24:27] different he's doing it in a different
[1:24:28] way he's revealing something through the
[1:24:31] word that uh revealing something that's
[1:24:33] not in the word I should say that's just
[1:24:35] try to put some uh extra something on it
[1:24:38] to get people's attention to try to to
[1:24:41] try to mess with their mind because he
[1:24:43] wants to plant a seed there
[1:24:45] uh Satan wants to plant that seed
[1:24:48] because he knows if he can get that seed
[1:24:50] planted he's got an invoice an inroads
[1:24:52] to your heart
[1:24:54] to your to your soul if he can get in
[1:24:56] there amen
[1:25:00] but he preached that kind of scientific
[1:25:02] social educated Progressive gospel to
[1:25:05] Eve and Adam's bride believed it
[1:25:10] Adam's bride believed it in fact
[1:25:13] brother Branham said that he went
[1:25:16] looking for this kind of wisdom when she
[1:25:20] left her husband brother random says she
[1:25:22] went out looking for the kind of wisdom
[1:25:24] that would make her a smarter or the
[1:25:28] wisdom to to to be in a higher position
[1:25:32] of some kind he said she went looking
[1:25:34] for it
[1:25:36] you know what friend
[1:25:38] if there's something in your life that
[1:25:40] or something of the word that you don't
[1:25:42] like or something that you prefer not
[1:25:44] doing you know you're gonna find
[1:25:46] somebody that's going to tell you it's
[1:25:47] okay not to do it right right well
[1:25:50] you're gonna find somebody that'll tell
[1:25:51] you it's okay to do it or whatever the
[1:25:53] situation is amen you're gonna find
[1:25:56] somebody it's like that story I told
[1:25:58] about uh my old boss years ago when I
[1:26:01] first started at uh Columbia beauty
[1:26:04] supply beauty and barber supply back in
[1:26:05] Charlotte we had a sales consultant came
[1:26:08] in and he he was a Christian
[1:26:11] considered himself a Christian went to
[1:26:13] church regular and all these things and
[1:26:15] he would always try to witness to Roy
[1:26:17] and try to tell Roy about Jesus and Roy
[1:26:20] wasn't interested but he kept doing it
[1:26:22] anyway and kudos to him for trying to
[1:26:25] witness but you know he got to the point
[1:26:27] and said Roy why don't you go to church
[1:26:30] Roy doesn't go to church he said why
[1:26:32] don't you go to church he said well this
[1:26:34] that and the other whatever excuses were
[1:26:35] he said well you know just keep going
[1:26:38] until you find one that you like he said
[1:26:40] that this this man told told
[1:26:44] Roy he said going to church is like a
[1:26:47] glove you just have to find one that
[1:26:49] fits and I thought all you're fishing
[1:26:52] for is trying to find the preacher
[1:26:55] that'll preach something just to tickle
[1:26:57] your ear so that you can live however
[1:26:59] you want to and do whatever you want to
[1:27:02] and think that you're a Christian right
[1:27:05] that's that's the world today yes that's
[1:27:08] what you see all these people like uh
[1:27:11] I'll I'll say it just like the Oprah
[1:27:14] Winfrey's and different they live all
[1:27:16] kinds of ways and say and say they're a
[1:27:19] Christian and and musicians Sometimes
[1:27:22] they come out and they look just
[1:27:24] as horrible ungodly and and and and
[1:27:28] that's so uh how they look and how they
[1:27:31] had that's up to them but don't do all
[1:27:33] that they come out and try to say that
[1:27:34] you're some kind of Christian right
[1:27:36] that's your devout Christian or some
[1:27:38] kind of and then look and act like that
[1:27:40] and talk like that and see
[1:27:42] you know
[1:27:44] that just doesn't fly but but a lot of
[1:27:47] people believe that
[1:27:49] because they found something like the
[1:27:51] glove
[1:27:52] amen that that it it fits
[1:27:56] well you can find it even go in I had I
[1:27:59] had the other day I had the the older
[1:28:02] guy the guy I told you was the
[1:28:04] curmudgeon on my team is a good friend
[1:28:07] now uh he asked me the other day he said
[1:28:09] well I'm Newton he said you know if you
[1:28:11] had a bigger Church you wouldn't even
[1:28:12] have to work here because he was talking
[1:28:13] about our managers planning on retiring
[1:28:15] stuff and he said you wouldn't even have
[1:28:17] to do this job I said well Rhonda said
[1:28:20] you know if I compromised on the word I
[1:28:22] could probably have a church full people
[1:28:23] yeah
[1:28:24] he's looked at me and laughed he said
[1:28:26] that's probably true
[1:28:28] amen I said yeah I was just late let
[1:28:30] down the standards let down the bars
[1:28:33] Don't Preach to Pure gospel I mean sure
[1:28:36] you can have a church full of people you
[1:28:37] just compromise a little here and
[1:28:39] compromise a little there the the sin's
[1:28:41] okay just you know come in and repent
[1:28:43] and you know go out no that's that's the
[1:28:46] same deception that has came through the
[1:28:47] Catholicism right you can live whatever
[1:28:49] your life you want just come and pay
[1:28:51] your pennants and going about your way
[1:28:53] you'll be okay and what you know
[1:28:55] whatever they do uh you're all you're
[1:28:57] all fine you know and if you do die
[1:28:59] outside of it we'll we'll pay enough
[1:29:01] money we'll we'll get you out of
[1:29:02] purgatory anyway it'll be all right
[1:29:04] that's the same Spirit yes amen I said
[1:29:08] you can find it if there's something you
[1:29:11] want to do you can find anybody in the
[1:29:13] and you look on YouTube or whatever
[1:29:15] you'd find anybody that'll tell you it's
[1:29:17] okay to do so and so oh they'll just use
[1:29:19] the scripture to try to confuse you or
[1:29:22] that was the Old Testament well if that
[1:29:25] was the Old Testament the Old Testament
[1:29:26] it's not any good anymore why does your
[1:29:28] Bible on your put have the Old Testament
[1:29:31] in it then if you don't even believe it
[1:29:32] why do you even have it what's the point
[1:29:35] right amen oh they'll go over to the New
[1:29:37] Testament though when it serves their
[1:29:39] purpose but see it's seen it's the seed
[1:29:42] of Satan that he's continuously trying
[1:29:45] to sow into the minds of people to get
[1:29:48] them to believe the same thing that he
[1:29:50] believed in the garden that God did me
[1:29:53] what he said
[1:29:54] but God means exactly what he says
[1:29:56] Saints yeah amen amen he means exactly
[1:29:59] what he says and he does exactly what he
[1:30:01] said he would do yes amen Adam's bride
[1:30:04] believe it and he has succeeded in
[1:30:07] filling his so-called bride of Christ
[1:30:09] the Church of the Church of the second
[1:30:11] Adam with the same thing
[1:30:14] my Saints what is it then what day are
[1:30:18] we living if it's gotten that way to
[1:30:19] this world today that they live in that
[1:30:22] kind of deception
[1:30:24] throwing out the word of God for the
[1:30:27] word of a man
[1:30:28] throwing out the truth of God's word
[1:30:30] because some other preacher said it was
[1:30:32] okay
[1:30:34] oh God have mercy amen we don't follow
[1:30:37] man we follow the word we follow what
[1:30:40] Jesus Christ said amen
[1:30:43] praise the Lord I did have this one more
[1:30:45] I wanted to read
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:48] the seed of discrepancy listen this is
[1:30:51] uh January 1965.
[1:30:57] January 1965.
[1:31:00] seed of discrepancy look each age
[1:31:06] each age produce such a crop every age
[1:31:10] has did it and ours is no excuse we have
[1:31:13] the same thing and a greater age of it
[1:31:16] than all other ages put together one
[1:31:19] because all those things are all wound
[1:31:20] up right in this last stage right all
[1:31:23] that
[1:31:24] White Horse red horse black horses all
[1:31:27] becoming to a Pale Horse right it's all
[1:31:29] come into one now
[1:31:30] at this last time this is The Showdown
[1:31:33] amen this is The Showdown Aid this is
[1:31:37] The Showdown time
[1:31:39] amen uh this is the ending of world's
[1:31:42] history as he said this is the this is
[1:31:46] the great discrepancy uh that's ever
[1:31:49] been upon the Earth is on the face of
[1:31:52] the Earth today
[1:31:54] discrepancy in other ages pulled them
[1:31:56] away from the true and living God to
[1:31:58] Idols today Jesus said in Matthew 24 24
[1:32:02] that it would be so close that it would
[1:32:05] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:32:07] possible talk about discrepancy oh my
[1:32:12] scene of discrepancy is so Connie
[1:32:16] Satan is among the people and just such
[1:32:19] a theologian to 99 of the word 99 of the
[1:32:25] truth brings about as much Division and
[1:32:28] separation from God as a complete lie
[1:32:33] because one little deviation of the
[1:32:35] truth is a lie amen you can call it
[1:32:38] white lie you can call it purple eye
[1:32:40] yellow green blue I don't care what
[1:32:42] color you put on it it's still a lot
[1:32:44] right amen
[1:32:46] and people do the same thing Satan among
[1:32:49] the people just such a theologian a
[1:32:52] doctor of divinity trying to spread that
[1:32:55] seed again what does he do complicates
[1:32:58] the word
[1:32:59] what does he do complicate the message
[1:33:03] you've got to listen to me to understand
[1:33:05] it you got to come to this church for
[1:33:07] you can get it friend that's a lot of
[1:33:09] the devil
[1:33:10] amen God never prerequisited every one
[1:33:15] of us as individuals we go where God
[1:33:17] leads us
[1:33:18] absolutely we better go where God leads
[1:33:21] us to go amen but we don't have to be in
[1:33:25] a certain Ministry or list of certain
[1:33:27] thing
[1:33:28] that that's just man trying to
[1:33:30] manipulate people
[1:33:32] trying to make you feel like that it's
[1:33:34] got to be done in a certain way by a
[1:33:37] certain person uh
[1:33:40] how could you ever listen to such a
[1:33:42] horrible speaker well you know what
[1:33:44] brother Branham by no means was even
[1:33:47] close to being the best speaker that
[1:33:49] there ever was Amen brother Branham was
[1:33:52] not a very good orator but he got his
[1:33:54] point across he got his message across
[1:33:57] amen he got what he wanted to say across
[1:34:00] and of course it was to the people that
[1:34:01] were willing to listen
[1:34:03] it was a people that was willing to
[1:34:05] listen you see the difference in in in
[1:34:08] Billy Paul's testimony when he talks
[1:34:10] about the man who was witnessing this
[1:34:12] guy working he gave him a book a brother
[1:34:14] ran him and he gave him a book and the
[1:34:16] man came back the next day and said
[1:34:18] don't you ever get me anything by this
[1:34:21] man ever again
[1:34:22] the man said what's the problem that's
[1:34:24] that's one of the best messages he said
[1:34:26] that man in that book called me a buzzer
[1:34:29] and he said that's funny because I read
[1:34:31] the same message and that same man in
[1:34:33] that same book called me an eagle
[1:34:35] amen
[1:34:36] it just depends where where is the seed
[1:34:40] being sown
[1:34:41] amen what seeds is being sown amen
[1:34:44] praise the Lord
[1:34:46] look
[1:34:47] let me finish this quote now Satan is
[1:34:50] among the people and just such a
[1:34:52] theologian such a doctor of divinity can
[1:34:55] teach that word almost almost perfectly
[1:35:00] Jesus said so but just watch him
[1:35:03] there'll be somewhere said we'll come uh
[1:35:05] now that wasn't for this oh yes it is
[1:35:08] because God said it was God's book Satan
[1:35:14] is more Connie more deceiving
[1:35:19] more
[1:35:21] intrusive than he's ever been and he has
[1:35:24] to be because he knows his time's
[1:35:25] running short yes he knows that his
[1:35:28] ability to be able to influence all of
[1:35:30] you is about out right right he knows
[1:35:32] this time because he nobody knows it any
[1:35:34] more than he does well what does he do
[1:35:36] he Stripes he fights he battles he sends
[1:35:39] out as many of his little minions his
[1:35:42] fallen angels that he probably possibly
[1:35:44] can to get you deceived could you get
[1:35:46] you below what you really are to try to
[1:35:49] get you to doubt in some way to question
[1:35:51] things about God and his word and the
[1:35:53] message oh my that's exactly it's just I
[1:35:57] I think I told you all one time a very
[1:36:00] dear friend and still a dear friend in
[1:36:02] my opinion
[1:36:04] left a message
[1:36:05] I called him and said brother I heard so
[1:36:07] and so he said well I haven't left of
[1:36:11] course he had and he has but that's what
[1:36:14] he told me personally on the phone he
[1:36:16] said but so and so on such such and I've
[1:36:18] seen things and he said I I read this or
[1:36:21] I saw this video by a certain brother up
[1:36:24] and and mile looked at those things it
[1:36:26] was so convincing he said I'll send it
[1:36:28] to you I said don't bother brother
[1:36:30] not interested yeah
[1:36:33] yeah why would the Bible says don't give
[1:36:36] place to the devil amen and anything
[1:36:38] that comes against the word or God's
[1:36:41] prophet and this message is of the devil
[1:36:44] and I'm not interested I don't want to
[1:36:46] hear it I'm not going to hear it that's
[1:36:49] just the devil trying to see that's what
[1:36:50] he he pushed play and that devil got
[1:36:52] into his head it already started working
[1:36:54] obviously and that seed was sold yeah
[1:36:57] and now what do you do it's going to
[1:37:00] come to fruition it's going to come that
[1:37:02] seed it's going to come to maturity
[1:37:05] amen and to this day
[1:37:07] he's still not
[1:37:09] still not in the message he preached so
[1:37:11] many years in the message I don't know
[1:37:13] how he can how you can read the Bible
[1:37:15] and not see the message in it I
[1:37:19] to me the only way the the way I know
[1:37:22] this message of course through
[1:37:23] revelation of God is by the message
[1:37:26] that God brought through a prophet I
[1:37:29] look and I think well how how can you
[1:37:31] read the scriptures we just read and try
[1:37:33] to preset to a congregation without
[1:37:35] including what you know brother random
[1:37:37] said and the truth about Serpentine how
[1:37:39] could you do it right
[1:37:41] I don't I don't see how a person can do
[1:37:43] it but anyway it's just a place to try
[1:37:47] to sow that seat it's like Jesus said in
[1:37:50] Matthew
[1:37:51] I'll go to it real quick but Matthew 13
[1:37:53] 24 another Parable put forth unto them
[1:37:57] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened
[1:38:00] unto a man which sowed uh was so good
[1:38:03] seed in his field oh man God so good
[1:38:08] seed in his field but while men slept
[1:38:11] his enemy came and so tears among the
[1:38:14] wheat and went his way now the seed that
[1:38:17] was sown by the good man is going to
[1:38:19] come up
[1:38:20] the scene that was sown by the madman is
[1:38:23] going to come
[1:38:24] up it's going to reach it reach its
[1:38:26] place Adventure
[1:38:27] and when you become a Christian
[1:38:29] you still reap what you sow you
[1:38:31] understand that
[1:38:33] we understand we still reap what we sow
[1:38:35] the thing is when we become Christians
[1:38:37] we sow a lot less or hopefully none of
[1:38:40] the Bad Seed anymore so that a whole
[1:38:42] crop is nothing but good seed amen
[1:38:45] that's the point and then we reap the
[1:38:47] goodness of God from the seed that's
[1:38:49] been sown that's God sowing that seed
[1:38:52] the bad man is Satan The Good Man Is God
[1:38:54] but Satan continuously tries to sow that
[1:38:58] seed and in the sowing of that seat well
[1:39:00] let me let me go to this one point and
[1:39:02] I'll close here Revelation chapter 6. he
[1:39:05] did this exact same thing through the
[1:39:08] churches
[1:39:09] he did it in the Garden of Eden
[1:39:13] and he did it in the church ages
[1:39:18] excuse me
[1:39:19] Revelation chapter 2.
[1:39:23] let's look at this Revelation chapter 2.
[1:39:26] let's just start with the verse one unto
[1:39:30] the end of the Church of Ephesus we're
[1:39:31] starting the church ages now Ephesus the
[1:39:33] first church
[1:39:35] write these things says he the holy
[1:39:37] Seven Stars his right hand and walketh
[1:39:39] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:39:40] candlesticks I Know Thy Works in my
[1:39:43] labor and thy patience and how those
[1:39:45] cannot bear them which are evil and thou
[1:39:49] has tried them which say they are
[1:39:51] Apostles but they're not
[1:39:54] and they are not and has found them
[1:39:57] Liars what was that scripture we read
[1:39:59] the other day about hymenius and felitis
[1:40:03] that Paul said they're Liars right Paul
[1:40:06] called them out by name and said these
[1:40:08] people are deceivers these men are
[1:40:10] teaching false Doctrine
[1:40:12] amen and others believe it
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:16] he said you have found them that are
[1:40:19] liars
[1:40:21] they are liars amen people don't want to
[1:40:25] say that anymore today friend but it's
[1:40:27] still the same it's a lie
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:33] it's the one common denominator that all
[1:40:35] politics has
[1:40:37] they're all liars
[1:40:39] I shouldn't say oh maybe there's some
[1:40:41] good people still on there I don't know
[1:40:43] but they're just a bunch of liars you
[1:40:47] can you can see something in front of
[1:40:48] your face
[1:40:49] and then you can go and look and
[1:40:52] somebody's saying well this isn't that
[1:40:53] you know I just saw it well don't
[1:40:56] believe your eyes now because what
[1:40:58] you're looking at is not real
[1:41:00] yeah you're just lying just say it
[1:41:03] you're just a liar
[1:41:04] you don't want to tell the truth because
[1:41:06] it's inconvenient for you just tell it's
[1:41:09] just a lie right amen and and that's
[1:41:12] scripture Jesus here says that you have
[1:41:15] found them to be Liars they are liars
[1:41:19] false Doctrine what's a false Doctrine
[1:41:22] it's alive yes what is it people out
[1:41:25] there it's like I said a minute ago if
[1:41:28] there's something you want to do or
[1:41:29] something you don't want to do friend
[1:41:30] you can find somebody somewhere on the
[1:41:33] Internet or somewhere that'll tell you
[1:41:35] it's okay to do it or not do it right
[1:41:37] amen that's deception yes and they'll
[1:41:41] try to use the word against it but it's
[1:41:43] the word that tells you to do it yeah
[1:41:47] amen amen but look it's trying to fit
[1:41:51] that glove
[1:41:52] amen trying to fit that glove I just
[1:41:55] want to find a teacher with itchy ears
[1:41:57] it'll tell me what I want to hear
[1:41:59] that I can live how I want that I can do
[1:42:01] what I want amen if you if there's
[1:42:04] something if there's a desire in your
[1:42:05] heart outside of God's word you can find
[1:42:07] somebody a preacher that'll tell you
[1:42:09] it's okay
[1:42:11] amen and it's not
[1:42:14] because it's against God's word what is
[1:42:17] Jesus calling them
[1:42:19] Liars they're Liars they're deceiving
[1:42:23] people into believing what they think
[1:42:25] are their interpretation of the word is
[1:42:27] and they're Liars
[1:42:29] amen
[1:42:30] is it true
[1:42:32] and it may sound harsh for me but that's
[1:42:34] just the truth
[1:42:35] amen it's not a time to to compromise on
[1:42:40] the word
[1:42:41] if Jesus said they're Liars that's what
[1:42:44] they are I just gotta believe it and
[1:42:47] third verse and has born and has
[1:42:49] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:42:51] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[1:42:54] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:42:56] thou has less left thy first love how
[1:42:59] did they because a seed was sowed
[1:43:02] amen a seed was sowed and when that seed
[1:43:05] was sold there was people that got
[1:43:07] convinced of it and started swaying from
[1:43:09] the original truth
[1:43:11] amen they started going off the original
[1:43:13] word
[1:43:14] look at this now
[1:43:16] remember therefore from whence our
[1:43:18] fallen and repent and do the first works
[1:43:21] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:43:24] and remove that Candlestick out of its
[1:43:26] place except thou repent
[1:43:28] but this thou has that thou hate us the
[1:43:32] Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also
[1:43:36] hate
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:39] well if you go to the next one you read
[1:43:41] how much further it's gotten how much
[1:43:43] further down each Church it has gotten
[1:43:47] in one a seed become a deed and next to
[1:43:50] deed becomes a realization and and on
[1:43:53] and on from the dropping of the seed
[1:43:55] continues on with Satan moving his
[1:43:59] church that he created in heaven with a
[1:44:03] third of the Angels forward into
[1:44:05] believing his lies
[1:44:07] he did the same thing in infiltrating
[1:44:10] the church angels as they began off in
[1:44:12] Ephesians
[1:44:13] amen their deeds became reality they
[1:44:17] became things that they continuously did
[1:44:20] that was off the word of God yes they
[1:44:22] started baptizing in titles instead of
[1:44:25] the name of Jesus Christ they started
[1:44:27] adopting
[1:44:29] different ways the communion and the
[1:44:31] fellowship and
[1:44:33] ended up where it is today
[1:44:35] amen where it's Fallen to the place that
[1:44:39] it's at today
[1:44:41] how did it get there through deception
[1:44:44] right through seed through the sowing of
[1:44:47] seed
[1:44:50] amen like I said you can search high low
[1:44:53] you'll find somebody that that'll say
[1:44:55] what you want them to say
[1:44:56] amen there's a lot of voices in the land
[1:44:59] today Saints you got to be very careful
[1:45:01] of what you listen to
[1:45:03] listen Ephesian Church age
[1:45:06] the True Vine hated the formal Deeds of
[1:45:10] the Nicolaitans and so did God God hates
[1:45:13] the Deeds of the nicolasans what was
[1:45:16] Deeds listen we just said this but let
[1:45:18] me read it what was deeds in the
[1:45:21] Ephesian Church in the Church of Ephesus
[1:45:25] became a Doctrine in the pergamist
[1:45:28] church
[1:45:29] something that was sown as a seed
[1:45:32] became a Deeds to the place that God
[1:45:34] said you've left your first love
[1:45:36] to then in the Perkins age became a
[1:45:39] doctrine that they were actually called
[1:45:42] to follow and lived by
[1:45:44] amen a Doctrine a Doctrine is something
[1:45:47] that we
[1:45:48] consider truth that we uh a a truth of
[1:45:51] God's word that we live by
[1:45:53] that's what a Doctrine is that's why we
[1:45:55] call the book that they assembled
[1:45:58] together uh the Cod book brother Branham
[1:46:01] Church order Doctrine because it's a
[1:46:05] it's a form if you will of things of
[1:46:08] things that we live by yeah it's what we
[1:46:11] live by we don't live by it because
[1:46:12] they're rules we live both because we
[1:46:15] believe it's the word of God and it's
[1:46:16] our heart to live it but that's what we
[1:46:18] live by we look that's what a Doctrine
[1:46:20] is a Doctrine here
[1:46:22] was adopted because it was alive
[1:46:25] amen a lie of the devil in the program
[1:46:27] is church in in Ephesus the first church
[1:46:31] it was a deed in the next Church it
[1:46:33] became a Doctrine
[1:46:35] can you hear it do you understand it now
[1:46:37] it was a deed in Ephesus and watch over
[1:46:40] here in pergamas it became a Doctrine it
[1:46:43] just started here in its little baby
[1:46:45] form but what did Paul say
[1:46:49] Paul said Beware because upon my
[1:46:52] departure Grievous wolves will come and
[1:46:55] enter in not sparing the flock
[1:46:58] what did Brother Branham say
[1:47:01] basically exactly the same thing yes
[1:47:04] upon my departure there will be people
[1:47:07] come and they will deceive you they will
[1:47:09] they will try to change the word
[1:47:11] manipulate the word make it sound like
[1:47:14] something that that tickles the ear
[1:47:16] instead of what the truth of God's word
[1:47:17] says it is amen but that's God I know
[1:47:21] there's many things that we do as
[1:47:24] Christians as Born Again Believers it
[1:47:26] grates against the flesh yeah absolutely
[1:47:28] because that black dog and white dog are
[1:47:30] going to keep fighting until you have no
[1:47:32] more breath to draw that's right amen it
[1:47:36] grates against the flesh but we know
[1:47:38] what is Right In God's word and how to
[1:47:40] live it yes and what God uh God has the
[1:47:43] standard that God has for us that we
[1:47:46] stand on amen amen it's God's word man
[1:47:51] is still trying to complicate it
[1:47:55] God is trying to make it simple and
[1:47:57] today
[1:47:58] that war is still carrying on
[1:48:01] the war that started in heaven is still
[1:48:03] going on today yes the Battleground is
[1:48:06] up here
[1:48:07] say he's still trying to sow his
[1:48:09] spiritual seed in you to try to get you
[1:48:11] to doubt disbelief try to complicate it
[1:48:13] try to make it beyond your reach it's
[1:48:16] like the proverbial banana on the stick
[1:48:18] or whatever you like to eat amen you
[1:48:21] know you're on a stationary bike and you
[1:48:23] just can't seem to get the right to that
[1:48:25] to that whatever it is I just give you
[1:48:28] peddling peddling pedaling and kinky
[1:48:30] well that's what Satan does that's not a
[1:48:32] God Amen it's attainable from God but
[1:48:36] Satan always tries to make it so it's
[1:48:38] just the deception of the devil that's
[1:48:40] just complicated so much so they just
[1:48:42] won't they can't see it they won't
[1:48:44] understand
[1:48:45] that's part of the seed of the devil
[1:48:47] that tries to get you this leave what
[1:48:49] God 's True Word
[1:48:51] doubt first
[1:48:53] and then manipulate amen let's stand if
[1:48:56] we could
[1:49:09] God's word is pure amen God's word is
[1:49:12] simple
[1:49:13] God's word is there if we believe and
[1:49:16] hold to what that word says yes God
[1:49:19] makes it come to pass amen we've seen it
[1:49:21] over and over and over I mean we heard
[1:49:23] testimonies in here today
[1:49:25] amen of God showing himself revealing
[1:49:29] himself to understand
[1:49:30] Amen to me I see how how what a
[1:49:36] difference it makes
[1:49:38] when a man of God like brother Dennis in
[1:49:41] his testimony I'd just pick on you uh
[1:49:43] talking about
[1:49:45] them looking for that Turtle looking and
[1:49:47] looking and looking and looking can't
[1:49:49] find them despair discouraged let's pray
[1:49:52] yes oh man
[1:49:55] praise the Lord and his wife who he's
[1:49:58] still witnessing to to try to come and
[1:49:59] be here believe this truth yes born
[1:50:02] again
[1:50:03] sees that you don't think that doesn't
[1:50:06] have an influence
[1:50:07] when after prayer and after not seeing
[1:50:11] him for how long did you say a week
[1:50:13] over a week and looking and looking at
[1:50:16] nowhere to be founded and all of a
[1:50:17] sudden 30 minutes after praying there he
[1:50:19] is
[1:50:21] amen
[1:50:23] that's just god-working Saints that's
[1:50:25] God working in our lives and that
[1:50:27] testimony could be coupled with probably
[1:50:29] another 100 more if we had the time for
[1:50:31] each of us to remember and try to
[1:50:33] recount the many times that God's done
[1:50:35] that for us yes yes amen
[1:50:37] praise the Lord he's mindful
[1:50:40] amen he knows he knows what he's doing

[1:54:38] I have a testimony that when I first
[1:54:42] became a Christian it was about 15 18
[1:54:45] months before I became filled with Holy
[1:54:48] Ghost and I just prayed and fasted and
[1:54:50] everything I could
[1:54:52] until that point would happen and what
[1:54:55] had happened
[1:54:57] um there was the change in me that I've
[1:55:00] got to share something with you
[1:55:01] I I had heard a message like this always
[1:55:06] from the pulpit which always be preached
[1:55:08] but
[1:55:09] it made me so afraid that if I would
[1:55:12] just see something
[1:55:13] you know that maybe I'd get a seed
[1:55:15] inside of me and oh golly maybe I'd fall
[1:55:18] you know
[1:55:19] I didn't understand the ceiling of God
[1:55:22] was just that it's the ceiling
[1:55:25] and and nothing can get in or out have I
[1:55:28] made mistakes oh yeah
[1:55:30] and but it's just like it's just like
[1:55:35] God will Point those things out and you
[1:55:39] might feel a little a little
[1:55:41] uncomfortable about something well
[1:55:43] that's that's God in Me working to show
[1:55:47] me something's not right and he will
[1:55:49] straighten it out if he has to point it
[1:55:51] out in a congregation and somebody that
[1:55:53] doesn't even know me and say you over
[1:55:55] there you're doing such and such and so
[1:55:57] on so and it's half
[1:55:58] you're correct yeah
[1:56:01] cannot fall when you have the seed of
[1:56:05] God inside testimony sister that's my
[1:56:08] testimony I have not Fallen God every
[1:56:10] time has correct we understand that and

[1:56:17] Holy Ghost absolutely nobody said
[1:56:19] anybody was falling no but it made me so
[1:56:21] afraid I want to share my testimony the
[1:56:24] fear is gone well it's a fear of the
[1:56:26] devil the fear is gone fears of the
[1:56:28] devil absolutely
