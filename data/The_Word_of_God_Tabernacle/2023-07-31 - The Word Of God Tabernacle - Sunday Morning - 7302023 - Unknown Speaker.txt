his Spirit Divine thank you Lord Jesus amen buddy would you mind checking to see there prayer requests amen as you notice we have a few missing today little Gabriel fell yesterday and broke his leg no thank you buddy um talked to shry last night he uh I guess apparently jumped off the trampoline and as boys do a thousand times in their lives uh you know and kind of stumble fell down and he went to get back up to take off again like most boys do and of course Gabriel and he fell right back down and his leg was hurting so they took him to the doctor and found out Urgent Care found out they did an x-ray that is tibia is broken it looked like by the X-ray to me it looked like it was broken two places it's what it looked like to me uh the police break for him down a little lower here uh on his shin bone and it's it looks like a pretty clean break but and his pain has been so severe he finally got to go to sleep around midnight last night she's just been given some Motrin Children's Tylenol and it just hasn't helped manage the pain very well so they took him to the ER the children's ER I'm assuming at Banner because that's the only Children's Hospital I know in town is Banner on Campbell so I'm assuming that's where they went because his pain was just so bad and they were going to try to take care of him there and uh they're they will be able to put a cast on him there they couldn't do it where they took him last night they put a splint on and was going to get a cast in the next couple days but now that they're down there they'll probably go ahead and set it and put the cast on everything so but of course please pray for little Gabriel uh I'll that I don't know that that boy is going to go crazy he's he's not one to sit around so he's gonna have a a tough time with this one I can imagine he's probably going to be pretty active in that cast that school's getting ready to start and everything so please pray for little Gabriel you needs needs a touch from the Lord right now amen and of course to make sure that's the doctors and everything heals perfectly doctor can set a place where the brand told us right doctor can set a place but it takes God to do the healing yeah praise the Lord so we believe that the Lord will just touch him also school is starting coming up I don't think I don't know when their school school starts at different times I know Joel and Emma starting school this year starts on the 9th I believe is that right so just remember that prayer I had written it down and I thought well we could say this next Sunday so Lord willing next Sunday we'll have Gabriel and Alice back with us and and uh you fellas if y'all go to school and I want to lay hands on all the school kids to come up next Sunday and pray over you all because it's a tough situation even though my grandchildren home school it's still uh it's still a struggle and uh public school or anything like that it's Spirits out there is just just tremendous so I want to lay hands and pray for them but just keep them in in your prayers too with that school starting coming up I'm sure I was going to wish her happy birthday she just had a birthday but with us today remember Micah in prayer he's going to be leaving after service today driving to Phoenix as he mentioned last week he's going to be driving the Phoenix today flying out of Phoenix in the morning and going to Boston for a little vacation so please remember him and of course I don't know if the fires have gotten any better or the smoke but um it will just it is it will yes while they're there it will be anyway so uh just pray the Lord would just touch him and Grant him traveling mercies he's supposed to travel again uh this afternoon to Phoenix and in the morning flying to Boston and then flying back on the 9th August 9th so we're gonna miss him while he's gone or a couple of services so please remember him in prayer also me and my wife are going out of town tomorrow so please remember us in prayer we're just going to go on a little vacation Monday through Friday and just spend some time together alone and just get away so uh to a little cooler place too so it's getting kind of warm it was pretty warm in El Paso last week it was it was as bad as here obviously but it was 105-ish or so every day when you're outside in it it's it just gets really hot after a while it gets kind of it gets kind of tough but uh last work week was much better than the one before so uh but I appreciate your prayers for us too Lord we just bless our trip and traveling mercy so amen and I didn't have any other written requests or nothing else that was text to me so yes please yes thank you um not so little anymore but Tommy uh for those who don't know uh Tommy or Tommy that comes to zancas of Tom and Karen's grandson I refrain from Colin I guess he is still Little Tommy uh because they're all named his brother Tom and his son Tom and uh so uh but he's he's not really little anymore but he was uh playing with his dog the other day you know they had those labs and um anyway and he was playing with it and they they reached down or something for a toy or a ball at the same time the dog just grabbed a chunk of his face and uh ripped his face open that was the beginning of last week I think yeah it's the beginning of last week so uh he had to they had to take him to Phoenix and do skin grafts and Stitch and everything and uh he's got a pretty long he's got a pretty long gash in his face so uh just pray the Lord touch him and continue to help in my I believe they're home now recuperating so but just pray the Lord would just touch him and help that heal nicely for him the way it should so thanks for reminding me I remember that before service and I forgot to write it down so amen anyone else having those unspoken request on your hearts the Lord knows all of our needs today and we stand to our feet if we could Lord Jesus with all our hearts and heads in unison oh yes Jesus faith knowing that if you're all carrying all sufficient God yes you are and Lord I remember one time you healed ten leopards and one ran back to you to thank you for you touching him yes and then you said to that one then I healed ten words the other night my mind and father May that speak to our hearts Lord that we are so thankful every day every yes time of the day to thank you and Praise Jesus for your goodness forever amen it's your grace that called us to your savior knowledge and it's your grace that keeps us and it's your grace that'll take us home father Yes Lord and Lord we know we're living in troubling times it's a hard hour to be a Christian yes my enemy Satan knows his job's very well and he's trying tighten this harder than ever before and there's as Peter said um scoffers will come in the last days yes saying where is the promise of his coming for everything Remains the Same since our forefathers fell asleep since the day of creation yes yes and Lord may not speak to our hearts you know your Prophet taught us never lose our enthusiasm amen for the coming of the Lord yes Lord the Lord how the enemy can play his music his fiddle music to say we got a lot of time oh and you know you're coming this way off in the distance father when you can't even come today let us be right let us be ready father Yes let our hearts be um dealt with in a way this has ever been done make sure we are right with you yes at all times and father I remember in the scriptures all the Miracles you worked in when Moses was leading your people out of Egypt the ones the following them again the rock that followed them that gave him water yes see that parted they let him cross on dry land thank you Jesus we have so many miracles father and yet we can read in the scriptures where Joshua and Caleb crossed over and that the children that grew up in the wilderness and finally took one generation instead of the children that cross over their children that forgot all these marriages how much worse do they speak to our hearts to say that a little carnality a little wordliness it's not gonna hurt my walk with you somebody else kill you spiritually and how the prophets spoke to our hearts to always put you first yes amen pray and at all times I remember David said in Psalms Lord let morning noon and night do I pray and cry aloud and God hears my yes Lord amen Lord speak to our hearts don't let us compromise father let your Holy Spirit exceed as our passion's been teaching your seal be real in our lives if we don't have us let us be like buddy Robinson she said amen you fill me with the Holy Ghost you'll find a pile of bones amen and brother Brown said he got it then and Lord uh touch each and every once every time another prayer request you're mindful of each and everyone that was yes oh Father for you are truly a great physician thank you our high priest I Can Be Touched by the feelings of our infirmities and within such we are healed we claim total deliverance we claim your healing portion we stand on your promises yes Lord father and all the other uh requests Lord you know what each and every one is they raise their hands may you bread them their hearts desire oh Lord May the testimonies come forth yet you truly met their needs according to your riches and Glory yes Father the best man of the service Lord use our pastor to speak to our hearts Lord that your word will fall upon good ground in our hearts that we can grow in a stature of your uh perfectness Lord yes and Lord help us to always love one another don't let that amen bitterness for they'll chase the you Christ out of our Lives yes Lord oh Father granted Lord in your name we pray name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like Mike has got a song to sing this morning so yeah Lord bless him and I God bless you another good testimony as well many people were hit by a pretty big storms at my house so bad hail about the size of a quarter in policy windows and as soon as it started uh I I just prayed over my car and because I it doesn't sit under any protection it just sits on the side of the side of the nature to stay a quick player prayer and lessen it and productive it yes it was fine my roommate a couple of days before the storm um we noticed the tree in the backyard was like getting loose from previous storms and he's like it's gonna fall in the house and it's going to fall in the awning and I texted and no it's not it's I I learned over the years to speak amen what you want yes to be done because we have the power to do that through of the Holy Ghost and Jesus and so I told him no it's not it's going to avoid the house and the Omni that that's over the back porch um and sure enough it when the storm came through two days ago they fell but it fell into the yard didn't touch the house didn't touch the awning praise the Lord amen this song I was saying many times feel free to sing [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh my God [Music] [Applause] [Music] they're my own home [Music] over there [Music] where my face [Music] there's just a few more days [Music] through the name [Music] [Applause] [Music] and some days [Music] foreign [Music] baby alive amen yes [Music] I'll stay down [Music] oh yes amen then some days [Music] foreign they're our homes [Music] Christmas [Music] amen all my friends aren't you looking forward to that praise the Lord that's our home amen you know what go out of town for work and the whole time I'm there I can't wait to get back home you know I enjoy going on little excursions and vacations and things like that there's nothing ever like being at home amen because there's inherent in our soul to pull for something to long for something that place of home that's calling us yes not just a natural home but a forever home spiritual home a home that God has already prepared for us amen it's waiting for us praise the Lord Jesus amen for our home is eternal that stand to our feet if we could now and then we'll go ahead and change the world to service amen turned in our bibles if you could to Genesis chapter 3 and I always love that song first I had that I actually had that song sing at my dad's funeral I can't remember if we sang it at mom's funeral or not I think we did yeah at mom's funeral too because it's so it means so much to me I I uh I really love that song very much so it means a lot to me when that song gets sung uh praise the Lord so in Genesis chapter 3 going to read one verse of scripture as we have on the Holy Spirit Again part 9 today we're going to talk about investigating judgment amen investigating judgment Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 let's buy our heads if we could for a word of prayer before we read the word precious Lord Jesus father we're very thankful again the grace and mercy that you give us Lord we thank you for our health our strength life we thank you Lord for blessing us to be here today Lord thank you for this place thank you for watching over us and keeping us and keeping us healthy and strong for your service Lord thank you God for another beautiful day Lord that we can live to open our eyes to give you glory and honor once again to come this place and learn about you and expect to meet with you and Lord for you God to have the preeminence in this place to you to speak to us Lord to flow through here God lord just like you did on the day of Pentecost as you come and sweep through this place and move upon every soul let it be hard in every life God may your Holy Spirit Lord show the demonstration of that Spirit into our lives God to us Lord to every request that was made known to those who weren't able to make it God for whatever reason we're just believing Lord that your hand is upon each one God to receive that that your glory and your honor would give Lord because you are you you promise never to leave us or forsake us Lord we know that your hand is upon us God we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done let it be done now Lord according to your perfect will whatever your purpose is this service Lord this day this place God let it be to us God according to your perfect will and use us For Your Glory and Honor help us Lord to do that it would be pleasing to you father to grow closer to you more like you God this this catching away this rapture we continue to talk about sing about this Beulah landlord that we're looking for that we're longing for oh God in our hearts God would just we just believe Lord that that we need to draw closer to you Lord become more like you this word for this last day for the sweeping away of that that bride Lord for this last time Lord may you just help us Lord today in this service again speak to us from your word anoint here speaker what you'd have accomplished should be done God we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now we pray amen amen in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 unto Adam also to his wife to the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them you could be seated if you'd like amen I want to stay in Genesis and I want to go over to uh Genesis the 18th chapter a story that's very familiar to us that we've all read and know about probably very extensively but it's the first one that I could find outside of the Garden of Eden that that involved or had this investigating judgment that's the subtitle that I want to speak on today again this is the holy spirit Part 9 uh investigating judgment uh it'll probably be just this one service for this but the first one I could think of uh the first one I could find scripturally of course we're only 18 chapters deep in Genesis uh outside of the Garden of Eden where we have investigating judgment takes place Genesis Chapter 18 it's amazing how the world could have devolved so quickly from the Garden of Eden and the Perfection that existed there uh to where God actually had to send investigating judgment out for the sin that was going on in the land it's uh it's incredible how quickly man can do evolve into sin when there's nothing there to help him to hold him to bring him along in the Perfection of God uh 18 verses here and of course uh it was even before that but the first investigating let's let's read this here again we know the story very well but I want to draw this context of this investigating judgment because I believe that this has a quite a bit to do to understand and I have touched on this subject before so bear with me if you've been with me through this topic before but of what's going on today and what's going on in this country today what's going on in the world today not just the United States uh of of things that's becoming very prominent that people talk about a lot you hear in the news now a lot more and of course there's cameras set up all over the place and there's a camera in everybody's hand and uh there's there's feelings going on all over the place of uh of of these things that they have no idea what they're talking about they have no idea what they're looking at uh but thank God we know a prophet that came and told us amen what that was Genesis and we'll get to that by the end of the service today Genesis Chapter 18 though let's read and start with this investigating judgment uh first verse down the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and loathed three men stood by him and when he saw them plural he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord singular he approached three men but he only addressed one of them amen because only one of them was his Lord the other two were just there as inspectors but there was one there that was his Lords amen and of course Abraham being Abraham and having that Revelation and knowing that he bowed down himself to the one almighty God and called him Lord amen which had visited him met with him and El Shaddai that he had named him the almighty God Amen he said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant so we got this background the three that were standing there one we believed to be God uh brother random talked about it and dramatized it is God took up three clumps of dirt and said Mike would step into this and Gabriel step into this and he stepped in the third one and that one was the one that Abraham recognized he called the one Michael Gabriel we don't know that that's not scripture but uh dramatizing it to believe I don't have any reason to disbelieve that so we'll go with that that the three were there that they were there for a purpose the purpose was in accordance to the study that we're talking about today so uh we'll just skip through the rest of that and go down to the 17th verse now I want to pick back up at the 17th verse um I'll tell you the 16th first let's start with the 16th verse we're still Genesis 18 but now verse 16. and the men rose up from fence and looked towards Sodom because that was the purpose they were there for and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do and of course he couldn't seeing the Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in Him Now understand brother Branham talked about God not withholding any information from his Prophet from his servant Abraham but what I want you to understand is that a lot of people consider based on that brother Branham as being an omnipotent individual but brother Branham was not he was the prophet of God that God sent here Amen to bring a word to us in the prophetic gift and the operation of that gift amen nor was Abraham there were things that Abraham was not privy to in his time but God but but let me clear this now but God did not withhold anything from Abraham that he needed to know that was pertinent for his time and his place and his responsibility amen God withheld nothing from Abraham because that was his God that was his uh servant that was his man that was his Prophet amen just like I believe God didn't withhold anything from Brother Branham that we needed to know that he needed to bring to a bride for this last day that we needed for the purpose that he served while he was here brother Brandon himself said that God will be unfolding himself through eternity well if that's true then God could not have told him everything he God would not have made him privy to everything that is God of course no human could contain everything that is God right so to understand or to believe him to be in that capacity helps us understand that God did not withhold the pertinent information that Abraham needed notice read the scripture with me again the Lord says shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do why he says seeing that Abraham shall surely be a great nation in all nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him there was a purpose for that was the reason why God was not going to withhold it from Abraham it wasn't just arbitrary information that God wanted Abraham to know just so he knew no he let him know because of the the uh the purpose of Abraham and and what he was in this earth to his people see that Abraham will do this this and this that's the reason amen not just arbitrarily but a reason a specific reason that God allowed Abraham God was Abraham was God's prophet and God was not going to withhold this from his Prophet because of the importance of this to him and to his people right amen lot being one of his people understand lot his nephew was one of his people right praise the Lord remember at the slaughter of the Kings Abraham uh told God he said uh uh uh look north south east and west uh lot is mine I'm gonna go get him he belongs to me and I'm gonna go get him and he did amen he went down to Sodom and he freed from those kings he freed lot and his family back out of the hands of those kings because Abraham took possession of what was his even if it was his nephew praise the Lord amen seeing then now that Abraham shall surely become a great nation Great and Mighty Nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him praise the Lord that includes the bride this is the I think the third week now we've gotten into Abraham a little the bride she is a part of that family the Royal Seed of Abraham through Jesus Christ comes the bride amen amen praise the Lord so that that is that belongs to us it's our possession for I know him that he will command his children his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he spoken has spoken of him and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will now this is God speaking now remember the Lord said now this is God speaking the Lord said because the crowd of Silence great and because of the sin is very Grievous I God said I we'll go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it would just come unto me and if not I will know God said I am going to go down how did God go down there he sent his he sent his angels right he said get Michael and Gabriel if we'll we'll go with that with the two servants he sent them when he sent them it's as if he went himself because he said I am going to go but he went in those two angels in human flesh he went through them praise the Lord understand now that's how God works today even he works through us God living in US Works through us is as if he is here yes praise the Lord because he's in us working through us we are his hands we are his feet we are his mouth we are his life in this earth praise the Lord God is here because he's here through us he went there because he went there through them and the men turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham Drew near and said well thou destroy the righteous with the wicked now you go through the 50 40 30 10 that Abraham pleaded to God because of course Abraham had family that was down there Abraham in his heart now of course I believe Abraham had a heart for people anyway uh that's one of the misnomers that we have uh as as as Christians even and as uh Believers in this message and and and and as bride that we don't have a concern for the world and that there couldn't be anything more wrong that we don't have compassion for people who don't see things the way we do there is no more compassion in this world for a lost soul than from a bride member or for someone filled with the Holy Ghost there is no more love in this world there is no more compassion that you'll ever get than what you'll get from someone who belongs to Jesus Christ because they know what the real compassion of God is they know what the real love of God is amen the real love of God is just not being passive the real love of God is as much corrective as it is uh affectionate right amen the real love of God is as much corrective and a lot of people don't understand that that correction is love yes because I love that person because I love humanity and I believe Abraham had a compassion for Humanity but Abraham also knew that his family was down there Abraham knew that lot his family was down there and he pleaded with God if there's this is there's this don't destroy it don't destroy the the righteous with the wicked and that was at Abraham's plea to God because God was about to destroy it but he sent his two Messengers down there to go spout the land he sent investigating judgment down into the land to go check to see what did God say to see whether it is according to the Cry of it has come to me as as is as wicked as it said amen is this evil as is sinful is this said it had gotten so sinful friend 18th 18th chapter of Genesis this place had become so sinful that he had this investigating judgment to go find out to see is this is is what it said it is and to those who would be righteous those who would be the ones that that God would spare he sent the investigating judgment angels to rescue them let's read this let's start let's go in the 19th verse now go through the uh Abraham saying prayer Adventure there's 50 40 30 10. God said our spirit for all those sake but obviously there wasn't that to say and there came two angels to Sodom and even and lot sat in the gate of Sodom and lots seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground which he should not have done and he said behold now my lords plural my lords plural without Revelation like Abraham had of course God wasn't with them it was just Michael and Gabriel that had gone down and he's and he bowed himself to those angels uh remember in Revelation uh the Bowing to the angel he said get up I'm your fellow servant the lot balanced himself and he says my Lord's plural turn in I pray you into your servant's house and Terry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night why because that was their Commission their commission wasn't to come have a party with lot their commission was to go investigate the wickedness of the city what better way to do that than to lay all night in the city streets but listen now he pressed upon them greatly and they turned him unto him entered into the house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down before they could even go back out the men of the city even the Minnesota can pass the house roundabout both old and young all the people from every quarter and they called into lot and said unto him where are the men which came into thee this night bring them out to us that we may know them or have relation with them in a sexual capacity that's what you go look up this word no that's exactly what it says amen this wasn't we want to greet them we want to meet them we want to welcome them to our neighborhood no no no they wanted to abuse them amen and and uh and an ungodly way hence today the word Sodom and sodomites and what that means bring them out to us a lot went out the door unto them shut the door after him and said I pray you Brethren do not so wickedly but hold now I have two daughters which have not known man let me I pray you bring them out to you you do whatever to them as good as in your eye only unto these men do nothing for therefore they came uh therefore came they under the shadow of my roof and they said stand back they didn't even want the women they were only interested man and man amen amen stand back and they said again this one fellow came into sojourn and he will need to be a judge now we will deal worse with thee than with them they press sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door but the men put forth their hand pulled a lot into the house to them and shut the door and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door and the men said unto lot hast thou hear any besides son-in-law and thy Sons thy daughters whatsoever thou has in the city bring them out of this place we've seen enough the the investigation is over we've went to we've witnessed enough in this city to know that this city is deserving of being destroyed yeah right for we will destroy this place because the Cry of them is waxing great before the face of the Lord and the Lord has sent us to destroy it Amen to destroy the city why wasn't even enough there they sent the angels to investigate to unleash what did they say the Lord sent us here to investigate and to execute judgment on this city you and your family can be saved if you'll get out of this place and that's exactly what is tried to do in this world today with the love of God and with the mercies of God to pull people out in time to be rescued from the destruction of this world and from the sin that is that is in degradation that is hindering this world that's destroying this world There's an opportunity even yet today if people will just eat it to come out of this world and to come into Christ amen there's a way today of escape from the destruction that's about to strike this land friend that escape is still the same today if they'll run to Christ if they'll accept him he will save them and bring them to himself right these angels if you read on actually had to take lot in his family his daughters and pull them out of the city to get them to leave right oh God have mercy yes and then of course we know that it rained far in Brimstone on the place and it sunk underneath the Dead Sea because judgment has struck investigation had took place the investigating Angels were there to make sure it was as bad as it was said to be and when they found it to be so they said lot do you have anybody let's get out of here lead this place because God has sent us to destroy this place and lot tried to plead just like Abraham did but of course lot doesn't have the standing that Abraham had with God right right no this place is going to be destroyed get out now's your chance get out of this city while there's time and it was just so much so in the and lot's wife's heart that she couldn't stand it she had to look back maybe to the screens of her friends maybe the screens of her card parties maybe the the the the wailings of the of the children something who knows what caught in her heart and she turned back to look at the destruction because God told her don't told him don't look back right when you come into Christ don't look back you just continue on with him and continue to go and to press into this how Mark of the High Calling continue to press forward don't ever look back she looked back she turned to a pillar of salt right amen If Abraham or if Allah had turned around and looked back to her he would have turned the same thing the daughters would happen but they continued on Don't Look Back just continue year to go remember her heart was still there her heart was still so much in Sodom that she couldn't stand to see it being destroyed with her friends or whoever it might be that was down there and so she had to turn around and look but the investigation God sent an investigation to go find out and once it was found out it was destroyed amen it was destroyed as in the and looked for him the Bible says Luke 17 you know Luke 17 yeah as it was in the days of solemn so shall it be in the coming of the son of man have we witnessed that today yes coming of the son of man has taken place Brennan now we are sitting in the same place that they were of investigating judgment as it was in the days of solemn so shall it be right now yes today we are standing we are living in an unprecedented time at the end of humanity with investigating judgments going on people don't even realize it they don't understand it and of course if you don't know and listen to a prophet like we do how would you know yes right I wouldn't know if I didn't hear and know and believe what he told me that was from God to look for to see this I wouldn't know either thank God for the I Salve that applied to the eyes that we can see the revelation of that word and understand what's going on in this world today as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be right now let's look at another one he's in Exodus chapter 12. we've touched on this through our studying so far as well Exodus chapter 12. amen these were investigating judgments that were relegated to a city or to a country but friend I want you to know that today what's going on is sweeping around the world it's not just a city yeah it's not just a country it's not just a continent it's worldwide of what's happening today amen because the entire judgment is taking place on the entire world and the the investigating and the judgment's going to take place just the same God always sends warning before he sends judgment he sent lot the warning for them to do for them and what did what and what did the prophet of God for this last day what does the ministry should of this day they cry still yet Revelation 18. come out of her my people and be not partaker of her sin yes that she be separated a a bride called adorned for her husband yes amen that's today that's today Exodus 12 now and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt it's the Paschal Lamb again like we said we spoke on CE you get into another different little uh topic here of this uh say this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of of the Year to you speak into all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to his house uh uh to the house of his of their fathers a lamb foreign house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his name I'm just kind of reading through this because we've already touched on this a few Services ago just to get to a point now let him and his neighbor take unto his house uh take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make their account uh your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out of the sheep or of the goats and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening time now again a couple of services ago we caught we've really covered that pretty thoroughly through that Christ and communion and the four days and uh the the male uh but the point I want to get to now starting to the seventh verse and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it it all with water but roast with fire his head his legs the pertinence thereof and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that it that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire good representing communion thus shall he eat with your lawn skirted your shoes on your feet your stash in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will look now I will now judgment had already been said now in all of the all of the plagues and and all of the warnings and all the chances that God gave pharaoh and Egypt to repent they would not do it they gave God gave ample warning ample opportunity ample time for pharaoh and his country to come under that auspice with Israel and that Israel go but he would not do it he would not do it so the warning now instigates the judgment the judgment's about to strike right look down the last warning the last one 12 first I will pass again God says I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite all the force firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord because the warnings were spurned and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt everyone as we spoke before that found themselves under that token was spares the judgment everyone whoever was behind that door behind that token was found to be saved even even if they had been I know the country of Egypt the scripture is talking about the country of Egypt was under judgment but if an Egyptian believed enough to come into one of the homes the families to go into behind that blood to go into behind that token they were saved just like the rest of them they were saved they were spared from that judgment anyone that is willing to come under the token anyone that is willing to accept and receive that for themselves is spared the judgment they sent investigation amen he sent warnings God sent Moses down there amen you had Michael Gabriel and uh and uh with Abraham you've got God sending Moses God sent Moses down to try to tell them to try to warn them to try to give them an opportunity to repent God always gives everyone a space to repent everybody God would not be a just God if he not did not allow every human a space to repent repent right right every human to the point of accountability of course everybody has the opportunity to repent everybody has a chance to accept and receive God and repent of their sins everybody does every human or it wouldn't be God but thank God he is a just God and he allows everybody that opportunity they had that opportunity and if anybody had accepted it if anybody had received it and gotten behind now see you can't just say oh I believe it you can't just stand there and say oh I accept it I I I think that's true but then you don't get behind the token it does you no good You're Just As Dead As the rest of them amen you're just as God as the rest of them lost just the rest of them let's look here now Christ revealed in his own word you remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom what happened just before Sodom God came down with some angels they had an investigation judgment said I've heard the city that it is so sinful so great so I've come down to find out whether it's all together true or not is that right what's that main one now that stayed with Abraham could discern the thoughts was in Sarah's heart behind him and you look around just a little bit and notice see watch what what watch what it's doing the same thing today now of course he's he's talking about himself but he's talking about the operation of the gift of God in his life same thing happening today that's why brother Randall could turn his back around to the congregation and call out names and tell them who they were where they were from what was wrong with them amen amen he didn't do it a lot but he turned his back time or two and turned around and started calling people out with his back said now you've seen your last sign what is happening then is happening now right what are we expecting to happen for this last day God's still doing the same thing to his Fridays he's always done the time is Drawing Near friend and brother Brown was talking what is it doing the same thing today amen he did the same thing through him praise the Lord it's an investigation judgment when after a while the church when it can't stand that place in every sea has been brought to a spot they'll be gone every seed has been brought in the bride will go yes they won't know what happened to them one will go one way the other the other uh over to the pastor's house one will go over here there first thing you know they're not there for Enoch which is the time God took him amen come down to that judgment that investigation judgment look here now and the token in the Jeffersonville token message getting back to the point of the Paschal Lamb and and the blood that was applied those that got behind the blood it wasn't just something that they that was a nice conversation uh we don't come together just to converse about these things our church is not a place of Fellowship even though that's what we do when we go out from here that's not the purpose of it right the purpose is to come together in one place for God to come and drop in the midst and to speak to us and for us to worship him and to learn of him and to grow closer to him amen it's not a social event look brother answer now in this token message what is sin unbelief you disbelieve the message you've disbelieved the word you disbelieved the witness of the token itself and it's identified itself in your midst and have you disbelieved that no matter how much you just believe it it has got to be applied you might say I believe it I believe it I believe it's the truth I accept it as the truth then that's all fine and good but yet it's got to be applied am I someone could stand in front of one of those Homes at that time and say I believe that that I think that's right that's the good thing and then they go on their way and they don't get behind the blood yeah they don't get in the token it didn't no good if you're not behind there you got you were destroyed now that was to the firstborn amen not everybody but the firstborn if you weren't behind the blood it did you no good whether you believed it or not whether you thought it was right or not that's not the point the point is not whether it's right or not the point is to get into it amen he goes on a little ways later on the same message notice they were not just yet come together to talk about the message they came together to apply the blood to apply the token that is what we must do not just talk about it to apply it but be but you believe give belief that Israel listen now same message Israel didn't come together to say let's all go over to Goshen today we'll drive up to Goshen you get on your camel and we'll take the ox card and we'll go over to the Joneses over here and so forth and the Goldbergs and we'll just go up to Goshen you know what Moses is going to be speaking there today oh that's so fine and dandy friend but what good does it do to talk about it amen my brother Rams he's laying a a little dramatization now to understand we'll get this together we'll go to this house you know this great this great revival going on Moses is going to be the guest speaker while then let's just have 20 30 000 people come if Moses going to be speaking let's just all show up when just the smallest meaning of this little person can be a man of Call Of God can be preaching the word just as pure and right as any and you got half a dozen amen what's the difference right people are drawn to so many other things besides the token it's a nice social event it's a nice thing and I'm not saying anything wrong with that friend I actually honestly I had now I know this to the fact it was the brother I know not in Tucson not in any churches around here that through my life of ministering my bro a brother of mine and Christ went to a church to speak I did the same thing when when certain brother to speak and that brother said now make sure and whatever you say Don't run off my make-believers because they're the ones that pay the bills now there I'm not saying that this person said Don't Preach this or Don't Preach that or don't say this or don't say that he didn't say that the Liberty was there to speak and not spoke whatever God said but that statement literally was spoken out of his mouth don't run off my make-believers they pay the bills that just come and congregate in a place what's the purpose of them being there and and friend don't give me if God has allowed them to be there at that time in that place to help in that capacity right then one that's fine amen it's like uh it's like that woman that had no food and had no money and she's sitting next to an open window and she's praying God send me some food Lord I need I don't have any money I don't have any food Lord just send me some bread I just just could use a loaf of bread two kids were outside the window listening to her praying they thought there's going to play a prank on her so they go to the grocery store and they buy her some bread and they come and they ring the doorbell put the bread down they run away and she cuts up from her knees and she goes she looks as the loaf of bread she says oh thank you Lord I appreciate God giving me this loaf of bread I needed it so bad and those kids jumped out from the bush said lady God didn't give you that bread we got it for you and she said God even if you have to send a couple of devils to give me some bread thank you for the bread amen whatever it's got to be to supply it yes praise the Lord amen if that's what it was to supply it okay but friend it doesn't get you where you want to go right be behind the token is the only thing that'll keep you from the destruction being behind the token not to apply that token is the only thing that's going to keep you amen the only thing that's going to put you in a Rapture too Moses going to speak today oh that's wonderful oh you know there's big churches in this message that's fine there's nothing wrong with that amen but when people start showing favoritism and say oh well so and so well if so-and-so is going to be well okay us old so-and-so is going to be there oh absolutely I'm going to be there then you understand is that of God that to me friend that's not of God amen now uh there could be little extenuating circumstances there uh I don't go out of my way to hear somebody preach that I know is off the word I don't do that I'd rather go when I know that somebody's on the word and preaching the pure and adulterated word then I I don't care if they're two foot tall or two uh miles tall I don't care if they have a big name little name I'll carry the big church little church I don't care if they're evangelist Pastor uh uh missionary you preach the word that's all that matters and it should be anyway yeah yeah I think that's a lot of the point Brother Brad I'm saying here it doesn't matter whether Moses speaking your name doesn't matter whether you've gone with the Joneses or The Goldberg no matter if we tell her talk about how wonderful get into it and the word become a part of your life be filled with the Holy Spirit be born again so that you can be that one when that investigating judgment comes under that it shows that token and it says I will pass over you yeah praise the Lord amen get beneath it he said not just talk about it but we get beneath it here in the Paschal Lamb the blood shall be for a token he had a token get into that token upon the houses where ye are and when I see that blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not come upon you to destroy you that was an overall sweeping judgment there an overall sweeping judgment that swept through that country that swept through Egypt that judgment that killed multiples of the firstborns in that City because they refused to get behind the token they refused to get in the blood amen it's swept through just like it's doing today friend amen the only way you can survive it is to get in the token amen Ezekiel let's look at Ezekiel chapter 18. or excuse me chapter 8. Ezekiel chapter 8. let's start with the 17th and 18th first I probably I was going to read the whole thing well we'll see Ezekiel 8 17. then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a light thing God's speaking now is it a like thing to the house of Judah that they commit the Abominations which they commit here is it something that I'm just supposed to overlook God's saying is it just something that's just supposed to be some that I wink at that that I just overlooked that he's singing This little light thing is it is it of importance to me or not is it a light thing see that they are committing these Abominations in my eyes for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose sort of like the you know the old saying back in the day I don't think people say it very much anymore you thumb your nose up to something and I just want to forget you that's kind of that's what that means thumb your nose nose up just means I'll forget you you know forget that I'm not listening to you I don't care what you've got to say that's what he's talking about it's not that they just ignore him but they actually thumb their nose up at it I'm not paying any attention to you that's the provocation they're provoking him to anger and they thumb their nose we don't care what you say we're gonna do what we want to do therefore because of this great overlying sin will I also deal in theory my eyes shall not spare neither will I have pity now this is going to be a quite a judgment I will not have pity and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear them this judgment is going to be sweeping friend it's going to be men women children no matter how much they scream yell cry God said he's not going to hear or have pity um he cried off friend that's exactly what's about to hit this Earth that's exactly what's about that we're about to did that we're not as a bride but this Earth's going to be dealing with amen because when this bride leaves all all the love all the mercy all the attributes of God is gone with him God's spirit goes over and starts dealing with the Jews but a worldwide sweeping thing is over right it's it's done the bride's gone it's finished there's no pity there's no mercy There's No Love No No Love of God that's what friend if that doesn't make us want to try to get as many as we possibly can into this I don't know very much I I don't want to see anybody go through that yeah I don't want to see anybody have to endure or live through that or die through that I told you before I think personally I think maybe some people with some gifts of the Spirit had some Visions or dreams or something of these dead people are still alive they call zombies the living dead because they look like that because they could try to blow their head off of the shotgun and blow half their head off and not be able to Die the Bible says they'll cry for the rocks and the mountains to follow them kill us something because death escapes them right can you imagine and people walking around like that I could have I could imagine people seeing her having a vision of that and seeing a person's head half blown off but still alive still walking around because they can't get death to take them hmm look now he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them to have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and the old six men came from the way of the higher gate which slide towards the North and every man with a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's ink horn in his uh by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of the Lord of Israel was gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house he calls to the man clothed with linen which had the writers incorn by his side of the Lord said unto him look who he's talking to First the man with the acorn the angel with the ink horn The Writer's incorn he's talking to him first he said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the four heads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof what's he doing he's sending an investigation out he's sitting investigating judgment because before he before the slaughtering Angels go through he sends the investigating Angel just like with Abraham when Abraham said Abraham said prevent your lord if there be 50 God said all spirit 40 I'll spare 30 20 10. but what did he do he destroyed the city but yet he pulled out the Innocence he pulled out lot in his family well God's doing the same here he's telling with Ezekiel he's saying no the the man the angel with the acorn you go and you mark every one in their foreheads this crying and sign the Abomination is done in the land that Mark was to spare those people from the slaughtering weapons of the angels that was to sweep through that place he first sent investigation he first sent someone to mark them praise the Lord now look at the Mark going on in Revelation 13. amen the mark of the beast on the hand or the head which of course people worried about barcodes and chips and all this stuff I couldn't care less about any of that tattoos or whatever they're doing now that's inconsequential it's a spiritual battle not a physical battle if it's a spiritual battle it's going to be a spiritual Mark and brother Adam said the mark of the beast is receiving the doctrine and their and their evidence of it is the right end of Fellowship right amen I believe that false Doctrine I believe that uh uh uh that that adulterated that that man-made word that Dogma I believe it just like you do they've been marked in their heads and they get marked in their hands with the fellowship it's not something physical it's a spiritual thing they believe a Dogma like disbelieving the true word because the only way you can believe Dogma is to disbelieve the truth because the truth takes precedent does it not the truth takes precedent over everything so if it's not a belief in the truth it has to devolve down into an unbelief or a falsehood Dogma and that's where people are today this Mark in their foreheads was to mark them as believers as those that are sighing and crying over the Abominations because the land had become so filthy and so sinful that God was going to destroy those men God was going to destroy those people he promised never to do the whole earth with the with a flood again but he never said it would be like we're a a city or a or a country or something like like Egypt and and like Sodom and and now here but God is allowing through the investigation a a measure of pity if you will on those that actually believe that have that have the character I believe that character is what was was causing them to to sign crime for the Abominations done in the land they were sorrowful about it they didn't they weren't a part of it they didn't participate in it they were sorrowful that it was happening the way it was happening God said Mark those people rest of them got destroyed amen Revelation chapter 7. and I want to read a couple of more quotes we'll close here amen Revelation chapter 7. uh verse 1. amen and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corner now I have time to go into the depth on this we have done it in the past before but I just want to hit the highlights of this year just for a few moments and after these things I saw the Four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth remember the winds is stripes and and turmoil uh War of the earth and that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the seed nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of their gods and their foreheads now notice the servants are Israel the bride is already sealed the bride is already gone and God seals those 144 000. you can read on after that the Servants of God but what's God saying he said before you Angels go out and sweep across this world he said Mark those that are the ones that belong to this this tribe 144 thousands the servants in their foreheads seal them first amen so that they receive and know the truth the message what is the message the message is Jesus Christ amen the message isn't brother Branham the message is Jesus Christ because it's the word revealed to a bride for this last day yeah Christ the word revealed to us now he's showing it to them and brother Ram said that would happen he said this message would go back to the Jews how is it by the revelations of the word through Jesus Christ and he comes and says where'd you get those scars he says in the house of my friends they realized that they had crucified their very Messiah they put on sack called fashion mourn amen before the destruction but what was that it was it was investigating the investigating judgment to make sure now people don't understand what's going on in this world today what's happening all around us people are in turmoil because they don't they don't see the government and and people taking pictures all over the place let me read you this in The Sixth Seal and then I want to read one more quote we'll close I'm going to skip a couple things here in The Sixth Seal another man says what if it what if you would place it want to get the word he said now I don't want to ask you a question so on and so forth he said now he said now this is the time of the investigation judgment this is 1963. he said 60 years ago he said this now he says is the investigating judgment now what's he talking about investigating judgment we'll see here Christ revealed in his own word he said you see these little pockets again cameras everywhere now cameras and people's cars uh taking pictures while they're driving there's cameras on every street corner and every major city there's there's cameras in everybody's hands videos pictures and their phones uh there's cameras videos stuff all over the place now that can be taken almost at any angle there can't hardly be anything done today even if it's done by surprise that's in a major Metropolis that is not videoed there are so many video cameras out today they see even plane crashes and things that are totally unexpected I saw uh that U.S Airways when that plane landed in the Hudson they had pictures of that just because his pictures there's cameras shooting outside of these high-rises in New York City you can see the plane going across and getting ready to land into the Hudson River I mean who would have known to stand there I mean could you imagine somebody standing and say there's going to be a plane crash in the Hudson River today let's stay here so we can video it but there's so many cameras now today it doesn't matter it's surprised or not it gets videoed and they're everywhere but the biggest thing is coming I think from the military a lot of military and commercial pilots are noticing and seeing the heightened activity of these saucers of these little unexplained phenomena all over the country all over the world and they're seeing it and people used to call them nuts but there's so many of them now crazy there's so many of them now that they can't they're they're not dismissing it anymore they're having hearings in Congress and and and and and whistleblowers and all this stomach uh stuff coming out this stuff is real it's beyond our human capabilities oh of course it is yeah yeah the prophet told us 60 years ago what it was yeah but you won't believe right you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers so forth well he said we better leave that alone he doesn't of course which he does quite a few times we probably should leave that alone then he doesn't here and out these people come up missing you say don't hear from them they're standing here they're standing there he said that's the way the Rapture is going to be one of them would drop right down and it's uh and this terrestrial body will take on a Celestial body and there won't be hiding her hair or bone left praise God he said that's the way the Rapture is going to be it'll be transformed in the moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that we all see now in the Pentagon wondering about these lights and these Mystic lights and area 63 what is the area 50 54 51. there we go Area 51 in New Mexico that's you go through that little Tyler Roswell and you go a little store and they got little aliens hanging all over the place little green things blown up and statues and stuff and little eyes and anything my goodness what did I walk into this and and because it's so close to area 51. it's just it's just a marketing gimmick but the truth of it is those investigating judgments is flying around here look now Pentagon wondering these lights these Mystic lights everything they're seeing in the sky you've seen they have one in the paper Jeffersonville this week and so forth a Mystic light oh they don't know what it is but listen little children they don't know what it is but listen it's going to pick you up one of these days yes don't worry about it yeah praise the lord it's not something that we fret over he said it's going to pick us pick you up one of these days and take us home he said that's the way the Rapture is going to be there's not going to be a hard hair bone left it's just going to sweep down and pick us up and take us home investigating judgment that's taking place now around the world and people don't know it it's getting such notoriety today and I've seen some of them I've seen some of the videos that like a military jet would lock in on and that thing is just just screaming across the sky I've seen them where they're in the air now I don't know all the what they show is real or not some people fake things but I believe I know this is real though because it's that brother Brown said it was real investigating judgment and and they'll just they'll scream across the sky and they'll stop and they'll hover there and move over here and go around and I've seen I've seen a video one time where one I believe was in San Diego that one was coming across the ocean all of a sudden it just stood there and it just went down into the water just went down into the ocean where'd it go you know but men can't explain it but thank God for a prophet amen who told us what it was so that we could know what it was amen praise the Lord the only Escape we have friend is that is the holy spirit amen look let me I am going to read this real quick just this one point in the Seal of God he said when the plagues was coming now again in in in Egypt only thing was protected was those who were sealed away in the Kingdom that is the investigating judgment the only thing that protects is those that are sealed away remember the only thing that protects you today what is our protection our protection is the Holy Spirit what is our inoculation our inoculations the Holy Spirit amen we are called out of the world to be not partakers of her sin well if we're not partaker of her sin then we're not partaker of her judgment we are those that God has bought and purchased and belonged to him and it's time for this Friday I believe we're right at him this bride to go home yes and we see it going on more now than ever now I didn't I I didn't I didn't talk about the uh plethora of cameras as being as diminishing the heightened activity I didn't mean to say that because of so many cameras we're catching it more now they're the heightened activity is there as well there's more and more and more of it going on not just people seeing it not just those things happening but more and more of it's happening friend and where are we now at the in the Middle Brother random said 60 years ago we are now in the middle of investigating judgment yes how many more warnings is God going to give before he takes this bride home and wipes this place clean how many more we don't know but or if I could just give another person something that they could hold on to that that will help them escape the wrath that's about to come to help them escape a burning hell but it's our responsibility to do so yes help us to be able to do it amen I don't anybody go that way but right now friend we're in we're in with this investigating judgment Congress they don't know what's going on news they don't know what's going on President they don't know what's going on these people have no idea military sees it commercial Jets see it people take videos of it they show it on cameras and stuff they don't know what it is thank God we do we know what's happening because we're at this end the evening time brings life amen that light is shining upon a bride that that it reveals what God is doing remember God said to Abraham will I withhold from him what I'm about to do a friend can I say this will God withhold from his bride what he's about to do look if I was me and my wife's been married 38 years but that's insignificant actually to the point the point is if I were going to do something significant our home family myself some I wouldn't keep her in the dark unless it was a surprise party I would let her know I would want her to be a part of it why would God do what he's about to do and let this bride be in the dark am I not right he's letting he let her know through a prophet and is continuing to unfold himself through the bride that are born again to understand this is what this is what's going on today so that we know it's not a surprise to us what if I said before to us they're not UFOs amen which is they're ifos UFO is an unidentified flying object an ifo is an identified flying object because we know what they are amen they're identified to us amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could not unprecedented Friend by the scripture God has done this many times starting in in Genesis when investigating judgments continuing on even yet today where are we at now I believe it's going home time I believe it's going home time help us Lord amen amen let's sing this song number 190. I'm just gonna sing it in the service 190 watching you praise the Lord watching you hey man you know the song we'll see you we'll try to sing it it's been a long time since I sang it so all along on the road to the souls through a boat there's an eye watching you every step that you take this great eye is [Music] watching you watching you there's an All-Seeing Eye watching you as you make life keep the pathway right [Music] I'm watching you watching you watching you every day behind the course [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] one more time [Music] I want to hear amen amen why isn't that the true saints that all seeing eye is watching us watching all of humanity praise the Lord and he's using his bride he's using his angels amen is this world is preparing for Destruction amen I hate to see a lot of the things that's going on in the world today our country's basically devolving into a third world country but it's getting ready to burn amen praise the Lord God help us amen thank the Lord that he gave us something that we can hold on to we don't have to worry about it we know amen God bless you I pray something was said to Blessings strengthen you today and the Lord Jesus again remember the prayer requests continue to keep those through need in prayer those are traveling and also remember next Sunday now next Sunday I will text obviously beforehand but next Sunday we're going to start at 10 instead of 10 30. okay so next Sunday we'll start at 10 instead of 10 30. my flight's at 1 22. so we're going to start at 10 next Sunday so please remember that again I'll text everybody as a reminder to remind you of that change also on the 20th uh I've kind of run out of options of what to do on the 20th the flights I'm supposed to leave on the 20th to go back to Pennsylvania and the flight schedule is just there's no flights after one o'clock uh from here going there there's just no way to get there so the choice I have is to cancel church or to have it on Saturday night which was Tabitha's idea which is a great idea the only problem I started thinking about it uh because we could have had it a little earlier so that it didn't get darker people could get home uh this place around here on a Saturday is not a very good place to be I'm here every Saturday as you know are pretty much every every other Saturday I come set my office study so uh I'm here mostly on Saturday sometimes till four or five o'clock in the afternoon and it gets loud around here all the parking's taken uh the music from both sides so I'm not sure that Saturday is a very good option uh it's kind of disruptive to be honest sometimes when I come into pray on Saturday uh on specifically on Saturday I'll bring my near my ear my noise canceling earbuds just so I can pray just so I don't hear all that because it's very distracting to me anyway but if anyone has an opinion if anybody has a suggestion or something um then I'm I'm more than opal open to suggestion but it's it's the end of August so it's a little ways away but I keep checking the flights nothing has changed um the only one the only one that's even close to being an option is there's a Delta flight that leaves at one and it gets to Harrisburg at midnight um uh which is a very difficult situation for me but then we'd have to start service at like 8 30 in the morning um so anyway if if anyone has any opinions or options thoughts let me know I'm open to any suggestions so what's wrong about 8 30. it's early a lot of people have a difficult time getting up that early in her service at 8 30. that's the only thing if everybody's up for it that's what I'm saying is I'm not ruling it out but it's two hours earlier than we normally have service so and I have had people tell me that that's very difficult for them to get up that early and get ready to be here on time anyway so what we'll just we'll just do some service but if anybody has a something you'd like to share with me later or text me or call me or something you're welcome to that that would be fine all right were you going to say something sure um all right um on the I follow this UFO thing for quite a long time and I saw a video where the lights would disappear and they travel so long or random and then they disappear and and I remember the scripture that says that um that this atmosphere above us is um the first or second heaven whatever you want to call it call it that these angels we've got bad ones and we've got the good ones and it's all mixed up and they've entered and they whatever they interview these beings these beings they never interview the good ones they always interview the bad ones and they always talk against the scripture against things that Christ you mean scientists or interviews [Music] and they interview them and and they speak against the interview extraterrestrials and they speak against God I think those people had too much something yeah yeah and and so that's and they're trying to prepare us for and enter uh for a an invasion from Aliens that's that they yeah anything else and they're trying to prepare us for an alien invasion um and so we got to really keep our wits about us in the word of God and with each other so that we can hold our head above this fanaticism yeah yeah I'm not sure that's even close to any influencing in the others but I appreciate that uh George Luke has got very rich off of that you know Star Wars and stuff but yeah this you're right there's a lot of stuff they make up and most of it's just for money a lot of them just want money or popularity or something terrorism usually terrorism as for sure but that's she's right it's all usually it's all a bunch of unbelievers that have no idea what the scripture says and what the prophet says have any idea so thank God we know yeah yeah praise the Lord amen so Lord bless you and appreciate you each one of you Lord Richard bless you amen will be dismissed in the word of prayer today thank the Lord for blessing us again to see another beautiful day amen praise the Lord I don't know how many more of them we'll get but we thank God for all of them [Music] thank you for being with us and preaching each of us have different need for it but you know exactly what those are and that you've delivered those two of us today will help us as we go our separate ways or whatever we may do through this week Lord Jesus Keep Us Safe it's healthy Lord Jesus amen for everything amen amen amen praise the lord lord Richard bless you today [Music] foreign [Music] it is [Music]
