expecting us to be him on the Earth today amen because he is living in Us Praise the Lord not like the world does it now the world says that they are gods they think they are gods they can do whatever

it's still going to be part two from last time yeah amen so praise the Lord kind of have a theme of that going amen so thankful to the Lord is mindful of us amen Jesus is Lord his brother no comes amen let's sing it to him now for he is Lord he is Lord he has risen from the de and he is [Music] Lord every knee shall bow every Tong that Jesus [Music] Christ I want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's my privilege to be here amen um if you would stand in honor of God's word we'll read Gospel of John 1 read verses down 1 through 5 right here it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God Amen all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not amen let's just pray our most gracious and loving Heavenly Father it is again our privilege to come and gather together throughout your word we realize Lord we are at the end time and Lord there are certain things which supposed to come to pass within our lives yes because Lord you're wanting to live and express your life now through us thank you Jesus Take Me Lord as your servant this morning Watch Over The Words which are spoken that Lord what are the things which are said Lord may they come from you grant it God I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen be seated what got me started on this whole subject was in God's power to transform brother Brandon made this statement he says Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was a son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in amen no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him he said God built himself a house a body to live in to come down so that we could touch him amen and that's what I got to I got to reading this and because now from the things that I understand from the message we are the Tabernacle yes we are the body of Jesus Christ yes but what are we understand about this body what me we you know we it's it's like what the reason we went over last time in the beginning was the word well the word to me is you know write a piece of paper and take scribble something down well that's a word you know I mean that's okay but it says in the beginning was there was a logos and the logos is what we tried to cover last time because the logos is the very essence of everything that God is amen I mean you know it like I say I was RA raised as a trinitarian well the father he the spirit that lived you know he guided the children of Israel well then he came in a body we called Jesus Christ we celebrate when he's in a baby and know we we weep when we find out he hung upon a cross and now we have this Spirit that's kind of like a a spirit tire to us that if we get in trouble then we call upon him and then when all of a sudden trouble goes away well then we figure now I can do it by myself but see that from the message that we have we begin to understand now that is all false yeah we have to understand as God came and God in different times and different dispensation God came for the sole purpose of expressing himself yes because he wants to be known he want he wants us to know who he is and what he is but also you don't not you will not understand who you are until you understand who Jesus Christ is amen because we are his body I literally we say oh yeah we're the body of Christ but we do do we understand that literally we literally are his body yes where does God dwell today I'm looking at him amen but he's wanting to release himself he's wanting to express himself yes and and and and so this this is the you know any this is the thought today one of the purposes he came he came in Jesus Christ he came in in Jesus Christ so that he can make himself known yes it says in John 1:18 no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the Father which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him right and made him known yes so if you want to know what God is like you look at Jesus Christ amen that's 2,000 years ago but still we have the scriptures we have a history of who he was what he was where did he go and what did he do and but but okay so that was 2,000 years ago but where does God dwell today right he dwells in US amen why is he dwelling in us he wants to declare himself he wants to make himself known he wants to express himself yes well now the only bodies he has like we we read there that you know now we are the Tabernacle that God dwells amen so he wants to live he wants to live his life through us he wants to express himself amen but see the other thing we have to realize is why could why could Jesus Christ why could that body declare who the father was because that body yield itself 100% to the spirit of God that dwelt in him amen amen well yes how is he going to do it to us we have to yield our bodies to him until he has the preeminence he cannot fully Express himself yes amen amen I mean I look at the prophet true I saw Jesus Christ in that Prophet yes I saw God living and expressing himself through that Prophet yes and so that's you know that's just recently I can look at a man in our generation who was born in sin shaped in iniquity come the world speaking Li a man who had a temper like a buz saw as he says a one that God had to lead him to death's door before he would surrender his life over to God and then watch his life as it developed over time from because he was called to be a prophet but yeah you have to look and to see God revealed himself a little here a little there little there a little there until finally we get to the time of the opening of the seals when all of a sudden brother Brown says now there's a there's a message delivered unto me and now I have to be obedient to declare that message yes it's not that the other tapes aren't important I look at brother Brown's life I look at how he how he lived how he acted when he was flying he always flew economy uhhuh I mean okay he didn't want to first class he could have yeah whenever he went whatever he did he always took the lowest place right he always humbled himself he always he never wanted to be regarded as something great he never wanted to be regarded as something important he just wanted to be one of the people amen and because of his humility I'm here again I can look at him and I and I can and I can see him so when we go back and we begin to look at who is Jesus Christ in Isaiah 9:6 run to us a child is born who his child he says unto us a son is given and the Garment shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called The Counselor the Mighty God yes the Everlasting father right the Prince of Peace amen when he was born he was God yes unto us a son is going is given who is this son he's the Mighty God he's the Everlasting father yes this is who he was where does that that God live now in us that doesn't make me God that does not make me the Everlasting father it merely makes me a temple in which that God now lives but he wants to express himself amen okay amen true brother Brahman possessing the enemy Gates he said he was the son of God when he was born he was God's virgin born son but when he become the Messiah is when the Holy Spirit Come on him because the Messiah means the anointed one yes never was in living dying and uh buried rising and coming he says there never was a life ever lived like this because he was he was God manifested In the Flesh when he was born he was the expression of what the father of what God the father is and God the father being loved and Jesus was the full expression of love he was L from the very first time that this little baby's hand stroked the pretty cheeks of his mother yes he was led amen and so we don't know anything about his childhood but here we understand that that that we we express the nature of our parents there are actions that I have they can relate that to my dad or my mom right okay and and you know I can't help some of these things because that's part of my genetics right but see in Jesus Christ the only genetics he had was God yes it wasn't part of Joseph and Mary right no it God and God Alone the very genetics of him was nothing but God yes therefore the only thing the only attributes the only nature that he could express was that of God Amen okay so this is where the problem we have I still have a lot of me yes but God is trying to tell me to get out of the way so that he can use me so so he can he can express himself through me amen yes so this nature that I was born with I have to somehow cool it down have it die or whatever the the right word is so that the God can have the preeminence in my life amen amen right at the River Jordan it said that is what brother bam talks about that is when Jesus Christ became the God man in one place in in I think it's the lady of church AG he says Jesus Christ was introduced as the beginning of the creation of God right and and and and he so God and he goes on to say now God is creating himself in in in his bride God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation yes he says this is the true revelation of God Amen so God is creating himself in you yes God forain you from the beginning from from the foundations of The World God knew you you would come he had a purpose for you coming amen and the whole purpose for you coming is so that God could live his life through you so that God could express himself through you yes and why did God send as a prophet so we could understand who we are amen not what we're going to be no Who We Are are now the Bible says now are you the sons of God does not yet appear what you shall be but when he shall appear we'll be like him for we see him as he is amen well there's two ways to look at that when he comes okay and that thing but then to me he came in brother brandom I could see in brother Bram Jesus Christ yes that shows me what I should be like that shows me how I should live that shows me where I should go that tells me how I should act that tells me how I should interact with other people amen right I mean that's that's what I look at brother brass because that's the closest example of Jesus Christ that I have in my generation right amen the church in this condition brother Bron and God said I bear record saying the spirit of God like I dove coming down and abiding on him Hallelujah there you are the Dove and the lamb United together he said that's when God and man became one yes that's when Heaven and Earth Embrace each other Hallelujah that's what God was made flesh um flesh that's when God came down from the spirit form and was made and was made man and dwelt Among Us yes amen and you know I I don't know how other people look at when you receive the Holy Spirit the things that I've been studying and the things that I haven't think I have an understanding of when I was born into this world God placed a seed in me I had to go through my life do different things but there was always God drawing yes but there was a time when all of a sudden God managed to get through to me and I accepted him as my savior amen but then all of a sudden God led me in different ways where I receiv received the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord but then from that point on God God through that spirit that now lives inside of me he's trying to transform me he's trying to change my nature Into His Image yes yes but I I didn't fully I grasp exactly what God was doing and so then all of a sudden God had the Prophet come across my path and and that all of a sudden there was another re Revelation another realization that came that literally I was a part of God from the beginning yes I'm going back to being a part I'm going back to being a manifestation of God Amen right now I have this thing I have to deal with my flesh yeah but see after the after the resurrection or after the changing of the body or however you want to put it all of a sudden I won't have to deal with this amen all of a sudden I will be afraid to worship the way I want to worship I won't have any inhibitions I won't have any drawback no I will be able to enter in so into his spirit and so into his presence that literally then I will be free yes Hallelujah that's that's what I'm looking at amen when when we begin to look at when we begin to look at at at Jesus Christ I mean Jesus Christ went about he he he he healed the sick he he raised the dead he did Miracles and stuff but Jesus Christ he says it's not me who's doing what you're seeing yeah he says it's the father in me amen he does these things yes yes you look at brother Bram he says I was just standing there when he did it that's right I was just sitting there in the on the Ohio River when he came down amen when he's standing up there and he's deserting the thoughts he says God's just using my voice he says I have to listen to the tapes to find out what I said because I have no understanding of any of those things amen so here again but see that's what God's wanting to do through us he wants us to to he wants us to yield ourselves to him such that he can use us in the same way he did Jesus Christ amen the same way he did Peter James and John the same way he did brother bradam now he wants to use us in the same way but he takes the same yielding amen it takes the same yielding yes I mean I listen to different people and I start talking about brother B and they keep trying to elevate him brother R I have nothing to do with this yes right I am merely the mouthpiece that God said right he says I want to just go and be a Trapper I want to go living up in the mountains I'll come down and do whatever God wants I want to go back up to M you know amen but God had a different plan for my life so he had to yield to that yes but here again what is God's plan for your life right I'm not called to be a prophet wouldn't even want to be one yeah I mean what an understanding I mean anyway but when we begin to understand what he had to go through because of the office that he had I wouldn't want that amen I have trouble enough just being a minister of the Gospel yeah because of all there's trials and tribute there's things that come along and and then there's some days you know you you're sitting up Saturday you're trying to find something worth saying and then you stay up till midnight nothing you stay up 2 in the morning nothing I'll go ahead and go to sleep and all of a sudden half an hour before service starts ah now you're finally giving me what you want right very frustrating but anyway but we have to understand what is God trying to do and and and come follow me brother brandom he goes on he says Jesus was the transmitter of God's word uh he was the he he was complete God and complete man amen he goes on in spiritual food and newe season see well I said sure he wept he was both human and divine he was a man weeping but he had to be God to raise the dead that's right he was a man hungry but he was god- feeding 5,000 with a couple biscuits and five fishes that's right he was a man sleeping on the back of the boat but it was God in him that could steal the waters why and for why he was the me he and his message were one because he said he said I and my father are one right my father dwelleth in me he was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen yes but see that body that he lived in this this both the human part of Jesus Christ had to completely surrender to the god that dwelt in that body yes amen and and this is the this is the quandry that I find in me and and this is the thing that God has been has been been dealing with me on he says he says yeah this flesh is flesh mhm it's there's very much flesh yeah but there's something else inside of me it's the Divine that's inside of me it's the logos it's the essence of everything that God is that is what's dwelling inside of this Temple amen and that Essence that that logos he wants to take this vessel and now is the time because we are at the end of end of time now is the time when this vessel is supposed to come into the very manifestation and the expression of God himself Amen to do that I have to die right Amen to do that I have to totally yield myself to the god that dwells inside of me true amen it's interesting in John 14 Jesus says I'm you know I'm going to go away or something and anyway Philip says him Lord show me show the father and that'll that'll satisfy us Jesus said in him have I been so long time with you and you don't know who I am um he if you seen me you've seen the father so how sayest in this show us the father believe it's not that I am in the Father the fathers in me the words that I speak un you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me Heth the word believe me that I am in the father and the fathers in me are believe believe me for the very work's sake and and and and another place it says it says that that day you you will know that how I am in the Father the father is in me brother Brown says that's this day yes yes only this day is the comprehension going to come of how the relationship between Jesus Christ and the father that dwelt in him because that same relationship is now to come to full manifestation and expression in US amen Jesus say I don't do any of these things he says the father who dwells in me he does these things yes right Colossians 2 um and 2 and N for in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily in Hebrews 1 and and three who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high yes so brother BR is expressing all of this and the scriptures expressing Jesus Christ was the very image and manifestation of of God himself amen okay and in John 10 starting at 27 Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand now there's our security yes I mean all all my mistakes and everything I mean he knew what I was going to be from the beginning amen and I was born he knew every mistake I was going to make he knows every mistake I'll make in the future knowing all of that he was still willing to die for me yes why because I was a part of him from the beginning praise the Lord I always was his child praise God so he came to redeem back that which was a part of himself amen and therefore I don't struggle with a lot of these other things you know why would God blessed me because I his child that's right I I'm his wife okay um he he's my father I I understand him as a father I understand him as a friend I also understand him as God yes you know all all of these different relationships that that we have but it comes to the place where okay I'm beginning to understand who I am in Jesus Christ yes and Jesus says and and Jesus says my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man can is able to pluck them out of my hand and he says I and my father were one and then they were going to take him out and get rid of them uhuh okay yeah but see that applies to us sure I mean really this is where I mean this is the thing that I I I struggle with yes this this is this is what this applies to me see we are to be when in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God is going to be finished we are that mystery yes we are the mystery of God we are God is going to come and so possess the bride yes until the bride literally becomes the full manifestation the expression of God praise the Lord how it all is going to play out I don't know all I know is this is what he has said amen because he he he he has mentioned in another place so he does not air with the sh but then come P the Pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there but they call that the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shock but they denominated yeah but when you come to say I and my father are one all these other things that's when the Shar pulls away right but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in his fullness and in his strength for he is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord amen the bride has to come to the understanding and the Revelation that I and my father were the same amen but Jesus could say that because he was the full expression he could say that because that God that dwelt in him had total preeminence yes and until that God has a total preeminence in us we cannot say that amen I can say yeah the L God dwells in me and I yield myself into him and he speaks through me or does actions or whatever the thing of it is but if it ever can come to the place where I give that God the total pre preeminence in my life where literally he has absolute control I cannot say I and my father are one yes but that's where he said this is where the bride is coming to he says he says and now the church is uniting itself to the body of Christ yes it's got it it's it's got itself free cut away from every little fed getting itself ready getting together Union among them oh I love enjy the Holy Spirit moving among them oh my what a time yes he says for looking the uniting time is at hand for God is getting the church together to be a Rapture to go to the wedding of the great Union amen when when God and man will unite for eternity then creatures of time Unite with eternal and he had to give his life to bring about a power to unite other men with the same power for the Bride of Jesus Christ and now the church is uniting itself to the body yes and this is where we are at in time we're there amen the end time is not Future No it's here part of this amen the Earth is under judgment the world is under judgment you know I mean just just look around amen okay so where should the bride be if if we're still fooling around with the world if we're still looking at worldly things if we still got our head in the in the idiot box if we're sitting and feeding on all the garbage of the world and that's our focus of Our Lives then then where are we at until we lay aside the world and the things of the world until we take all of that garbage and lay all of that aside and make our Focus Jesus Christ amen where Jesus Christ becomes the very central theme of our life until we can do that then he cannot do what he wants to do through us right amen because in him was life and the life was the light of men the light shine is in the darkness the darkness comprehended it not he said for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life yes for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved yes he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God right and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil Amen in Jesus Christ was a life the life that was in him was God right that was the light the life of God that was to shine out to the rest of the world Amen Where is the that life now in US amen right are you a five wat bulb are you a 5,000 what B amen yeah how much of it are you letting shine right like in India I ask him you know where you know where does God dwell oh he dwells in my heart I say were you ever going to let him out yeah are you ever going to sit there and allow him to express himself through you right amen because until you do that you got him locked up in an i cute little box that you carry him around no he needs to be released amen and that's what the message came to tell us prise the Lord yes we all we all have our concept of what God is I mean when this is when I started this study you know what was God God the Father yeah the spirit that dwelt you know he led the children of Israel and all this kind of good stuff and that was nice he came in mzc he revealed himself to Abraham yeah we see in the Psalms we see that you know David wrote A Psalm down and described the crucifixion and we look in Isaiah and here again we have more things then we see this man we call Jesus Christ this body God lived in he did all these Miracles and wonders and all that kind of stuff that was 2,000 years ago amen oh now now that God and here again we the spirit of God now that spirit of God is coming and dwelling in US yes well you here again that's why I related now it's the logos amen it's the very essence of everything God is on the day of Pentecost what did that light do that that logos it came and it separated itself and began to live in every one of the disciples amen right and then when the other ones were baptized what would happen when the Holy Spirit comes on what is the holy spirit it's the logos yes amen that's what came and dwelt in them that's right so what do I have in me I have that lust and I'm just beginning to comprehend that all that God is I have access to amen but I don't have access to it for my own benefit right I have access to it to benefit others amen it's not about me it's not about you that's right it's not what you do for God it's what you allow God to do through you amen and and this is where we have to come to the comprehension this is where we have to come to an understanding at least this is this is my opinion we have to understand what God is and where God lives he that cometh to God must believe that he is yes what do you believe he is some wimpy little person that doesn't have you know can't get out of bed in the morning and oh I didn't know that was going to happen oh wow this is oh this is terrible I didn't realize this was going to happen the world oh man what should I do what should I do what should I to some people that's their God yeah yes that's true Amen to me God predestinated all this from the beginning sure why was there Co there had to be Co to bring about the change in the world system so that all of a sudden people would you know people would would not rely upon this that or the other and since Co has happened all of a sudden I find a lot of people who used to go to church sit at home in you know in their pajamas with their coffee cup and their donuts and said let's see who's on today oh I don't like him no let's let's check let's try this church mhm I know I disagree with him maybe this one here would be better that's right I mean that's what's going on Amen right go to church and leave the comfort of my easy chair and my coffee and my donut oh man no you here that's that's asking way too much yeah come on this is a reality amen this is the reality yes anyway true another thing I found interesting when I was doing the study looking at Jesus Christ we understand Jesus Christ was was both he was complete God and complete man okay he was both human and divine but we understand that Jesus Christ was the second Adam he had to succeed where the first Adam failed yes when Adam was created he was a Son of God yes the only genetic makeup he could have in him was it was was genetics of God yes there wasn't any Hatter there wasn't any malice amen okay God took Adam and he put La him on free moral agency brother bradam says you have to will to do the will of God right it's a it's a decision and he says that puts us back into the garden again you have to will to do God's will amen you can choose yes or God's way or your way true true and you make that decision 100 times a day right but the thing that I that I that I was looking at when I got into that okay so God now dwelt in this Temple of clay called we call Jesus Christ when he was born the very nature within him was God well that's the way Adam was my opinion but now all of a sudden God was dwelling God came on on on in the River Jordan and God in fullness came and dwelt within this Temple we called Jesus Christ amen it was the temple there was the tabernacle that Adam was living in that caused his fall yes would Jesus also fall because of the Tabernacle he lived in right why is it after why is it after he was baptized in the fullness came why did he have to go into the Wilderness and be tempted I mean to me in some regards this doesn't make a whole lot of sense but it comes down here again I'm just looking at this it talks about in Hebrews for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities amen but was not always tempted right like as you are yes 1 Corinthians 10:3 there is no temptation you taken you but what is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you're able but will with the Temptation make a way of Escape amen James 1:13 let no man say when he is tempted I'm tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and entice and what lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it have when it is finished bringeth forth death yes amen Jesus Christ was all man and all God yes so how this all God that dwelt in this all man how would it live how would it conduct itself Jesus Christ was the was was he he he was the word made flesh yes he was the one in the logos form he was the one that created all things he was the one that had all these powers and all this other stuff amen he laid that aside so that he could come and die on a cross for our sins right we go in there in Matthew 4 in 1 through1 11 it begin here Jesus here Satan was tempting him he says you're hungry you haven't eaten for 40 days if you're the Son of God prove it take these Stones turn them into bread use it for your own benefit right you're hungry you can do this if you're the Son Of God Speak it'll happen amen he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of bone yes so then he takes him up to to the Pinnacle of the temple see all those people down there jump the angel it's written the angels will come and make sure that you don't even stumble and fall right don't even Dash your foot against the stor manifest yourself glorify yourself in the eyes of the people when all these angels come down to your rescue and all these people wow look at this a whole host of angels come down and here he's descending and they're gently lowering him down oh man manifest yourself Express Yourself prove who you are Jesus says you don't live you don't tempt God Amen if God said for me to jump yeah I could have jumped sure but God did not tell me I could jump amen God did not tell me I could take the stones and turn them into bread hallelujah amen and he takes them up up and he shows them all the kingdoms of the world even today's Kingdom worship me I'll give you all of this bypass the cross right because if you're the Son of God if you came to redeem mankind he says you're going to have to die on a cross in order to bring Redemption to the people yes dying is not fun especially on a cross yeah just worship me I'll give you all this cast the cross amen he said no he says it's written he says Thou shal Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve amen yeah yes but see what have what have men done all of a sudden they get positions of authority and I'm the pastor of the church people look up to me brother Brown said there's three things that'll that will destroy men money popularity and women amen and I've seen too many of them one two or combination yes right amen and this is it is a temptation you cannot say that it's not right right and so how do you remain humble right look at the prophet he didn't even want brand tab to be named Bram Tabernacle amen right he doesn't want anything he says when I'm G I don't want people to remember me all I want them to do is remember the Jesus Christ that I serve right amen amen do you want money somebody gave him a cashier check for I think a million and a half he says I don't do what I do for money yeah here take it amen he could have lived like a rich man sure okay I mean here I mean this is this is what I see there was The Temptations brother bradam overcame all of them amen okay how are we doing and that's the only qu that the only one that can answer that is yourself amen right Jesus Christ overcame Satan the word yesman identified Masterpiece of God he says oh Christian friend put on the whole armor of God don't stand back with some little idea of some creat or something that you're standing by put on the whole armor of God yes when you go to fight against the enemy like our Lord did he showed that how the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan just with the word he had powers he could have smoked Satan any way he wanted to but he didn't use it amen he just took the word word and defeated him and defeated him with it it's written it's written it's written so he defeated Satan by the word of God right amen how do we defeat him I'm not feeling good so you told me your stripes by your stripes like you healed me already right okay so I'm Healed yes you don't feel like it heing doesn't matter what the word says amen during that in Satan's face right you're trying to make me sick I don't want to be sick I got too many things to do Satan go away amen God you said you promise your in God you you you will you cannot lie amen if it's written in the word you have to stand by Your Word yes and so if that's a promise and I have to make it to me yes by his CH we are healed right well that sounds nice but until you AB his right I am healed now that becomes the difference yes because now it's a binding contract between God and you that's right God you told me I was healed amen and therefore I am doesn't matter what I feel like doesn't matter the symptom so I might have to go to bed for three or four days and sleep and give my body the chance to recover itself that's fine however you want to do it but you've already healed me amen that's what I'm invting yes sir but see this is what we have to come to this is where we as Christians as the Bride of Jesus Christ we have to realize where does God live amen where does God dwell he dwells in me well if that God if the if the essence of everything God is dwells in me I have access to everything he is yes amen all I have to do is I guess for lack of a better word remind him of the promise he made to me yes amen true when we begin to look at at how how did God how did Jesus Christ live and how did he act in Philippians uh two it says look not every man on his own things but every man also in the things of others yes let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being the very form the very image the very essence the brightness of of of his being and all this other type stuff that we just read who being in the form of God and that's what he was thought it not robbery to be equal with God Amen he had all this power did he he he claimed to be a Son of God right this is how you you're claim if you're claiming to be a Son of God you're making yourself equal with God that's what the told him yes but he says that's what I am right I'm equal with my father okay he goes on but he made himself of no reputation he emptied himself and took upon him the form of a servant was made the likeness of men and being found in Fashions of man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross amen yes but Rob not robbery to be equal with God precisely because he was in the form of God he reced equality with God not a matter of getting but of giving amen amen right God so loved the world he gave praise the Lord amen you need healing you don't earn it he gave amen you need a job you asked Lord I'm I'm I need a job I need work I need he gives amen he brings this to pass and this to pass and this to pass and all of a sudden what's he doing he's leading you where he wants you employed right because he has a reason why he where he wants you true okay this is my opinion obvious that's right it says here he emptied himself he laid aside the form of God his deity and took on him the form the complete characteristics of a slave of a person with no Advantage with no rights or privileges of his own amen if and if you if you are a slave you have no rights amen your boss your the your owner is the one who dictates what you're going to do where I was in the Army um yeah I was a slave I don't know how else you're going to put it I don't want to go shoot somebody you know oh no you got to get up you got to do pt it's 4:00 in the morning I want my sleep I don't care what you want get out of bed we're going to go down there we got to do our physical exercise yeah I'm GNA have to run how much with a pack on my back come on man you're crazy he says you're a slave you will do what I have told you to do yes amen I learned that in basic training you have no mind of your own when they say jump you ask how high right okay but see in the same way it comes down to us in our relationship with God Paul was a slave to God a loved slave praise the Lord he went wherever God led him and directed him he would not speak because this lady was bothering him saying follow this you know and he had to wait for God to give him the command yes before he could cast it out amen yes well brother Bradon was a slave mhm amen all of a sudden God would say I want you to go into a certain certain town I want you to be at a certain CC counter you have to be there exactly 7:32 sharp and this person's going to come by this is how they're going to be dressed they have this ailment or this problem you are to pray for that person and then hi tail it out of town so it's 1032 or whatever I time him again all of a sudden he was there he knew he had to be there at that specific time amen because only at that specific time would that person come and only at that specific time would he be able to minister to that person yes so he would sit there and I don't know he didn't elaborate on what he did all I know is that he prayed for the person and then he left right and she turned around the person right heal he did not want to glorify himself amen I came at fitting because God told me to right well this is where we have to come but see Jesus Christ he prayed often so that he would know what the will of the father was that dwelt in him right Amen brother Brandon was a man of prayer because he had to know what God wanted him to do right he had to follow that leadership he had to follow that guidance amen well now it comes down to us yes what are we supposed to be doing we have to have an intimate personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen so that he can lead us he can guide us and he can direct us amen amen right it's interesting when when when when when Jesus Christ um in in in in in Luke the four fourth chapter it was delivered unto Jesus Christ the book of Isaiah when he open the book he found the place where it written the spirit of the Lord is is upon me because this is the reason why the spirit of God is on me there's a reason why I am here there is a reason why God's spirit is on me amen he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach Deliverance to the captives recovering sight to the blind set Liberty to them their are bruis and to preach acceptable year of the Lord amen that the anointing was on him for a specific purpose yes amen that has not changed we are his body amen why is his spirit Spirit on us to fulfill what the spirit of Lord is upon me because okay that has never changed amen it will not change until I get the changing in my body and all of a sudden then we get to go into the Millennium and then all Everything Will Change then yes but we hear again why do we he why are we supposed to be doing brother randam in in in uh that day on Calvary he was just just one man the perfect man he gave gave his life and he made an example for you now the first thing I want to say is this Jesus never lived for himself he lived his life was spent for others yes that's perfectly eternal life when you say you're going to go to church and do good thing it's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others yes it proved it when he come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others amen someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names he says you don't live for yourself you live for others yes that you might redeem that man you be you become Sons you are Sons you don't live for yourself you live for others amen well brother bam I can live for this brother because he sure such a nice man that's not it live for the man who hates you yes live for the person who kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might that he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get that in your bosom you're facing heaven then amen you sacrifice your own things and you give like a sheep does its W and this is some of that I mean here again this is the cont this is never preached I don't hear very often but we have to understand what is where does God live today he lives in his body that body amen why why why is he anointing to fulfill the same thing he did through his son that commission has not changed that Comm all the way through the book of Acts that's exactly what they were doing amen this is what brother bradam did that's what we're supposed to be doing yes okay and then like I say I look at the life of brother bradam he didn't live for himself right I mean he could he could have been he could have been a multi-millionaire sure he said I don't want to amen he lived in a humble Little Shack he drove a Ford station wagon and not the top of the line you know he could have been Mercedes it could have been you know Lincoln you know no just a standard board yeah okay that's what he like that's fine I I drive a Honda so I'm not in the message okay but we have to begin to understand why what was he doing what I I see God manifesting his his life through that man yes because literally he gave his life for to everything that he had he gave away yes so that somebody else could benefit amen true it's interesting when when Jesus Christ began to talk exhort his disciples in Mark 9 it says and he came to capernium and being in the house he asked them what was that you just amongst yourselves as we walked along the way but they held their peace for by the way they disput among them among themselves who's going to be the greatest he sat down and called the 12 and said unto them if any man desire to be the first the same shall be last of all and the servant of all yeah amen Mark 10 when the 10 heard it James and John when the 10 heard it they began to be much displeased with James and John but Jesus called them to him and said to him you know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister yes whosoever will be the chiefest shall be the servant of all even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life for ransom for many and first Peter Peter was giving an exhortation he say the elders which are among you I exhort who are also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory which shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you take the oversight there not by constraint but willingly yes not for filthy lcer but of a ready mind yes neither being as Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the FL amen you witness what you you you you should live the life as a minister you should live the life before others as an example of how they should live amen that's how brother brandham lived right he's the example yes you want to know how you should live and conduct and stuff look at the look at the prophet yes amen okay see this shall not be a of the sh brother bam he makes a statement like at the beginning God dwelt alone because he was eternal one wasn't even God God was an object of worship and the logos as we call it the word that went out of God that that that that's what Jesus Christ was and when that logos was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and he says and now as he gave his life for us then his Spirit comes back upon us and Jesus says at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me and I in you see all see is God all along God manifesting himself working himself through different ages so those three of the Father the Son the Holy Spirit same God working in three different offices yes Amen in John 14 it say I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also yes at that day you'll know that I in the Father the father you in me and I in you and brother Brown says that this day and going on in Matthew 5 it says ye are the light of the world city that's rest set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it in a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all men that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven and this is the problem that we have if we live it if if we continue to live in the world and do the things of the world the light of God cannot shine because they say well there's no difference between you and me right why why should I why should I forsake what I'm enjoying I'm living in the darkness yeah and I like living in the darkness I like doing drugs I like committing adultery I like stealing I like doing all this nasty you what we consider nasty things yeah I like doing this that's my nature and look at you you know better than I am yeah you have some shady deals when you have your business well okay you're stealing from them and places you frequent and okay but if we take our lives and we set them side and we dedicate ourselves fully unto God will we become holy and righteous in the eyes of people not because we're we're trying to to look at how holy I am look at how righteous I am that's nonsense excuse me but we begin to we just live it yes why do we live it because that's our nature yes we automatically should be to one another we automatically should consider the person we should automatic why because that's the nature of God itself and that nature of God so is supposed to so live in in us until it's no longer I who live but now it's Christ now living in and through me and this is where we should be coming that's right the message was not given to us to argue no I have this Revelation you don't just agree with me I cut you off unbeliever go I have this marvelous Revelation right brother where's your love love who wants love Revelation I don't need love I got Revelation yeah excuse me I'm not got no use for you either but I mean here but this is what I see with going on yeah I mean a lot of these doctrinal points are irrelevant yeah amen you know you know brother Ram says some think he's coming on a white cloud some think he's coming on a white horse and they'll separate and divide right he said but at least you believe he's coming amen I mean but see here again there have there should be more Unity there should be more love there should be more more interaction there should be more tolerance I guess is another word yeah because we're all we if we are all the body of Jesus Christ and the Very nature of that God should be being expressed through US amen right this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth amen for if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ then will cleanse us from all of our sins amen this last this last quotations restoration of the bright Tre otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right I'll go with you I you will be you will be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body amen just like a husband a wife is one person you and I are going to be one praise the Lord at that day you'll know that I am the Father the father's in me I in you and you and me oh I just love that Satan gets so angry at that see the one of God yes amen all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church and there you are amen it makes them all one right God bless you hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelu right praise the Lord amen amen Christ Living in US amen amen hope of glory yes God redeeming us bringing us back amen because it's like the prodal son prodigal son was never not a son he was always a son amen from his birth until his death he was always a son didn't matter what he did didn't matter where he went didn't matter if he wanted to emancipate from his parents he was always the son period no matter what you done what you went through in life where you were what happened you were always the Son of God God's Redemption brought you back to where you were always intended to be in his mind from the foundation of the world only the fall in the beginning of the garden e brought us through this sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies but you were never never that to start with you are always part of God yes always will be a part of God Amen and in him you are praise the Lord without him we are nothing but with him we are everything amen praise God he's the one who manifests himself to us made himself real to us continues to reveal himself to us and let us know that he's still living through us to prove to this world that he's the same yesterday today and forever forever amen praise the Lord I like brother n's analogy of people say God lives in me yeah well he may be in your heart but I want to see him amen amen I want to see God live through you yes I want your hands your feet your eyes your ears your speech your your everything yes be Godlike amen God speaking God walking God talking only because he lives in you but it is him in US praise the Lord living his life through US yes and you know me how many times have I said I don't live the life of a Chinese woman why because I'm not a Chinese woman I live the life of a white male why because I'm a white male am I live the life that I live because that's who I am if you live the life if God is in you and you were from him the beginning you live his life because that's who you are it's not something put on it's not a facade it's not something you're pretentious about you are him and you just live that life because that's who you are yes praise the Lord you love I I thought it was outstanding you remember I told you several months ago was long after I was hired on this job that U the the kagin guy not he's not kudin anymore well kind I guess but he's a lot Kinder nicer

fulfilling his pardon this expression sheep he's only expressing his sheep and it makes him happy to express his sheep because he's the Sheep yes praise the Lord people say how can you live the way you do why can you do the way you do why don't you do this why don't you do that because that's not who I am yes I'm happy with who I I am because I'm living the life that God manifested for me to

smoke and whatever they do and we hired a new guy on the job and he's nice guy but he smokes like crazy and just just who he is you know uh the Lord put him in my life for a reason so I'm just hoping before long he won't he won't do that anymore but I I I I look at these people and I want them to change I don't want anybody to be like that but you know the center of the world the things out here we got the we got some of the most powerful people on the planet that don't even know who what a woman is that's right in this country so but they're doing what they do because that's who they are yeah amen they can't help be who they are they're just manifesting who they are just like we are manifesting remember I'm I guess I shut up uh remember in Genesis the serpent bruises the heel of the woman's seed Satan is always impersonating what God's doing yes the real is the bride and Christ living through her the the fake is out here in the world where they're manifesting the same way just in a perversion of it amen the bride is living it by the truth of God's word yes amen thank God for that because it's the Lord Jesus in us living through us that proves to this world that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen I got to see here if I had some announcements I needed to make on my paper I did need I I did need to tell you I appreciate brother no appreciate his message it was so
