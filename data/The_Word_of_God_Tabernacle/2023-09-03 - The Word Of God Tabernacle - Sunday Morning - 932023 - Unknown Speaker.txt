she said she could anyone have an unspoken Ring Quest on your heart that's the only thing I have here today is anyone have anything else on the alarm trying to find out like those potassium levels are high um thank you for the update someone who's been bringing me up to date with every update that you give and knowledge she's still in the ICU oh she's I don't think I see you and she said no I'll make it okay it's good praise the Lord continue to remember yes I have a neighbor that came to me and career and want to get together and so forth and I said I wanted to learn about the Lord I said I can't teach you I said but I will give you things so that you can you said um you know pray together but he is he is a street person he lives in a home but he's but he's all that element and he's going through a lot of stuff right now and I just I just pray that he's this has been going on about a month now I just pray that you just please help that God's strength in him amen give him Revelation and then he would and he feels the poll yeah so you could just pray for him that God free and so what's his name Dale amen Dale that's your move with every question he he said he was ordained in the ministry years ago but uh I don't know what you're with Seminary sure again amen let's remember daily prayer and let's all stand to our feet oh I'm sorry yeah yeah just uh want to thank everyone for praying for my grandpa he's back home he just got home a couple days ago uh good I'll just keep them in prayer it still has a couple or a long way to go uh three with everything that would surgery so yeah he had cold oh yeah sorry I forgot I removed all of his bowels yeah they removed a large amount of visit testing and uh the surgery went well and I'm gonna do a checkup next or this week um yeah just keeping the prayer they they're still other there they saw another spot or something that they're sure not they're not sure about yet so they think they got all the cancer out from what they saw I'll be able to keep them in prayer and another request for my wife to have with us she's been experiencing really bad back pain for over a week now and she went to the doctor last week and they can't they have no idea what it is so they did some blood tests and a couple other tests as well but she's hopefully going to hear or has really been excruciating thing for her so even ibuprofen they gave her some ibuprofen it's not even doing really anything to help relieve the pain so it's really really exceeds using things so it's just constant you know all day there's periods of time of the day where it's maybe like in the mornings where it's not so bad but not really bad to keep her in prayer please I have a bolster this um neighborhood stairs and something finally good that God did um there's a sign on this window that says I'm not a hospital if you're injured please do not come to eat this door instead seek Jesus Christ I think his mother probably put that sign oh because he's the opposite but that's a good sign that maybe he's starting to chill off yeah yes absolutely first and foremost that the Lord would move on to amen I have a lot of problems request of prayer and I appreciate your prayers too uh obviously as you all know I'm leaving at about 1 30 flying out this week so appreciate your prayers for the week coming up so and for all of us

you have eternal life yes follow me and Lord we are coming down that home stretch I remember in high school I ran that half a mile and father the first one and a half laps was was so much easier but home stretch it was tough yes and I look forward to Crossing that finish line and lord the devil knows that it's almost his time is up yes and he's fighting us harder than ever before and that's why that home stretch it's it's getting harder father we need to have that discernment of your Holy Spirit working in our lives yes Lord you deserve what is right away word is always right and father to

me oh Father it's like brother and said I can know where you stand with God by the music you listen to by the things you have hanging on your wall but the programs you watch on television by the people you associate with oh lord it's time for uh to totally separate ourselves yes Jesus yes Lord there are needs this morning Father that are serious there's many that need a healing touch we know

change some more of the service now amen appreciate the Lord's goodness amen we're gonna begin here uh go back last um last well as far as I know right now at least the last one of this series that we'll speak on today Amen on the Holy Spirit let's start again in Genesis chapter 3. verse 21. but the last part of this the last um part of this series that I want to bring today on representation the Holy Spirit and representation brother random spoke quite often about representation having representation if you are represented if you will in heaven Amen in that representation will take place here on Earth through US amen praise the Lord so last part says to be the Holy Spirit part 13. I want to speak on the representation of the Lord today but in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 list of our heads for another word of Prayer Lord Jesus father we kind of prove this short to be here again you are house Lord and of course in our hearts so thankful that you let us hear brought us to this place today God of worship that we can worship Praise You exalt you uplift you Lord just give you all the glory praise and honor that you and more deserve God today thank you Lord for being with us Lord and thank you for moving in this place in a special anointing Lord hear God as you fall through here just like you did on the day of Pentecost Lord feeling all this house where we are sitting today moving upon every heart and every life maybe even extending out father believing to those that may be watching today God for your Holy Spirit to continue to move Among Us and strengthen us in a special way for this last hour that we lived this last mile this last little bit of this race that we must run yes oh God grant us your grace once again strengthen us in your spirit to continue to be led by your spirit to do only those things that will be pleasing to you yes Lord I pray that you bless this service today may your Holy Spirit again continue to move upon now this part of the service as we break forth the bread of life to us fresh God may you Lord just speak to us from your word Lord we know that there's a purpose there's a reason for this service being Lord in each one of us being here today so may you accomplish in US Lord what the purpose is that you have for us to be here today anoint speaker and hear a like God that that would be done according to your perfect will we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we commit it to you now Lord and we ask it ask these blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 and then uh unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them amen you could be seated if you'd like want to go over to Saint John chapter 4 Amen to start or Draw our context for this service today Saint John chapter 4 we'll read uh kind of a story here I believe I've I've never done it but I believe I've heard some brothers before tell me that they've done a little uh homework study on uh the different stories that brother Branham would tell through the scripture or the scriptural stories and I believe a brother told me one time this story was the story that brother Branham referred to most often whether in ministering whether in prayer line whether in discernment or whatever it was that this story The scriptural story about the woman of Samaria was the number one story the number one biblical account that he spoke of the most amen and it just Falls in line with what we want to speak on today in this last part of representation amen representation Saint John chapter 4 now let's just begin reading with the first verse amen and we'll read through it just read this story sometimes we kind of take little excerpts at this story and pull them out but sometimes it's really good just to start at the beginning of it and see all the nuances as it flows through to bring it to the point that it got to because we know about the woman of Samaria and what she did and who she was and how this developed and things but you know sometimes we we forget about the operation of God and why God does the things he does and the way he does them and uh and and and and and what he did to bring us to where we are today yeah and how the Lord spoke to us and how the Lord brought us in amen and showed us this truth of this light amen Saint John chapter 4 let's begin with again verse one as we read when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not by his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee and he must needs go through Samaria amen there's uh there was a purpose a reason uh it seemed like by the way the reading was this was out of the way this also was not a place that you would that a Jew would normally go to this is not something this is something very much out of the ordinary but Jesus needed to go that way this was something that the Lord had put and so many times that he does in our own lives where he leads us and puts us in places sometimes we don't want to go amen uh probably the most famous story about that is Jonah who absolutely so much so did not want to go he purposely headed in the opposite direction but God always makes a way to bring us to where we need to be amen but Jesus following the will of God knew that he needed to go through Samaria it was the time it was the place it was the person everything was right for the stage to be set for what was about to unfold so many times when we're LED of the Lord and God brings us to places or shows us things sort of like brother random when he the plane landed in Memphis and told him to walk he didn't know where he was going he didn't know what was going to happen he didn't know it was going to meet somebody he was he was thinking about messing his plane to go to his destination but the Lord had a plan God had something he needed to do so you could encouple this just like things in our life I'm not trying to put brother random on something extraordinary that he doesn't do for us because he does he leads us and guides us and things like this happen all the sometimes we don't understand or know why these things are happening but sometimes we can look back and understand Lord this is these things unfolded the way they did because of this it brought us to this place it it brought me here so uh this brought Jesus to this place he needed to go through Samaria amen it was God's will then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called psychar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the wall and it was about the sixth hour now obviously there's some carnality to this you can read into this that Jesus purposely said on the well because he knew who was about to come to the well but the scripture says he was veered and thirsty so he sat on the well now a lot of times when we're LED of God and God is leading us and all of this of course uh brings us around to the representation of God in our lives which is nothing more than what we've been talking about of the seed of God the seed of God in you in you is the representation that God put in you from before the foundation of the world Amen and this representation just brings us to the understanding that we know that it was always there this representation that God put in you was always there it never was a time that in your life that it was not there and it was just that one time that that that that light was to strike that seed that Spirit was to strike that seed to bring that seed to life but along that Journey so many times we do things that we don't understand or we do things that happens to us that brings us to certain places that we might not understand at the time but God is working a work God you have to always remember Saints God is always working a work in your life always uh brother Pat talks about puts it the way that God's messing with him uh that's brother Pat's way of putting it but it's a work that God's working in all of your life he is always where if you have representation you are born again you're one of his he is always working a work in your life no matter where you are no matter who you're with no matter what's going on around you no matter what of the physical aspects any of those things all those work around to bring about the perfect will of God because God is always working his perfect will if you let him in your life amen God's will is continuously working so it just says Jesus being worried from his journey set down on the well so that's what we that's what we see that's what we hear that's what God wrote that's what we believe amen why was it to that place at that time that he sat down amen God knows there cometh the woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink now it begins for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman again on another example of the little nuances of a story that brings us to the part where we need to be amen the disciples were gone into the city to get meat so who was there to help service Jesus the woman she was the only one that was there then at that time they thought they they might have thought they were just going to go get some meat amen but God had a greater purpose because there was to be a time now to where it was just going to be Jesus and the woman of Samaria at that will praise the Lord I just love you see how God works everything out so perfectly amen you just you just don't understand you just don't know I it just keeps coming back to my mind I wasn't going to say it but it just reminds me of the story when my wife was in Nogales and uh all the kids had to go out and the nuns gave them money to go buy tortillas for the day but they weren't supposed to buy the tortillas they were supposed to steal them but they had money to buy them that they were supposed to take the order in before they could pay they were supposed to run out and run back to the Catholic orphanage because the nuns were teaching them how to steal to live on the street because when you become of age you either got kicked out on the street or you become a nun that was your two choices so they would tell them they would they would teach him how to be religious and holy and then they would teach them how to steal and be a thug and so this is the time that a lot of the they would send out to go says she took the money and she went out there to go uh to go steal those tortillas it was like any other day any other girl any other circumstance that those that that church would send her out for but she went there she had the money in her pocket she got the tortilla and something told her to wait in line to pay for them knowing what was going to happen to him knowing that there was that there was a beating waiting on her by the nuns when she got back to the orphan she knew that was going to happen to happen to anybody that disobeyed them they got a beaten and she didn't know what her body was like without bruises until she got adopted later on uh because he just they beat him all the time for anything and everything and even if they didn't do anything wrong but it just remind me it's just like another day uh it's just another day it's just another day for This Woman This Sumerian woman is she's just going to the well like she always did and she went because of her character because of the life that she had lived I won't call it her character but because of the life she had lived brother Brown dramatized this a little bit further than I'm going to today to talk about how this girl is a little girl might have been kicked out on the street maybe abused by her father and things like that that caused her to be this way but all the time that even though she was in those circumstances or whatever she went through to bring her to this place she always had something in her that identified who she really was she didn't know it she didn't recognize it at the time and because of who she was because of the way that she had lived her life she was supposed to come to the well by herself she could not come to the well with all the other women she could not come with anybody she had to go by herself because she was considered a woman of the old Fame but there was a man that was going to be there that was going to meet her on this day like any other day but this day was going to change your life amen for his disciples went away to buy meat so it had to be all you notice how all the circumstances just developed to where it brought about this this tremendous time of Jesus meeting with this woman the will of God God makes God can call all circumstances to bring it about to where it it brings about his perfect will Amen in all of our Lives we just have to be willing to follow it yes that's all just be willing to follow it then set the woman of Sumerian to him how is it that thou being a Jew ask this drink of me which I am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gifted now look what he's doing because there's another story I want to read before we finish this today that's going to be just the opposite but it's going to follow the same pattern so listen as we go through it Jesus answered if thou knew it's the gift of God and who it is that sanity give me to drink thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given the Living Water the woman said unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from Winston hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the will and drank thereof himself and his children his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life amen now it's triggered something in this moment she's she's thought carnal all this time and she continues to just like just like any any of us in our Humanity uh that we do so often amen revert back to the carnality revert back to the humanity but Jesus is speaking to her of things of the spirit of Eternity of eternal life the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw again still thinking in the carnal Jesus said unto her but see so there's something there remember the story when a woman came up and brother ran a master uh do you believe oh yes I believe do you have faith oh yes I have faith but brother random could see in the woman that she didn't have what it what she needed to get the healing that she was looking for to get the prayer request answered she was looking for she needed her faith to get stronger she needed her faith to build a little bit and build a little bit so brother random said you go over here sister and sit down for a little bit and just watch the line as it comes through see the moving of God and all that God does and so she went over and sat down and uh one person after the other to the point that P that people started saying that uh that brother Brown forgot all about her he can't help her so he just set her over there and forgot about her and then pretty soon after so and so people he said okay now come on up amen what was he doing he was doing just like Jesus did here probably the reason that this story was mentioned so much by Brother Brown for the similar gift that was there God the discernment so Jesus sees that she's hungry she sees he sees that there's something in her that's different and because she now wants what he's talking about but but she's not quite there yet so he says go call thy husband and come hither now what's that got to do with any of it what has that got to do with any of this whole story and everything that's gone along what has that got to do with drinking water or having an everlasting water or anything I mean could you imagine if you've gone through this verbiage this conversation and you've talked about water this whole time being thirsty wanting water giving you a walk giving you water that you'll never thirst again and all that Jesus told her and then all of a sudden he stops and says well go get your husband what's that got to do with it amen but God's testing or God again is speaking because there's something that he's trying to reach down in her just like that woman that said over there was something that when brother Bannon said over the side there was something that needed to come in her more than what she had so that she could recognize it to raise to receive it now when he says go get the husband you could think well what's that got to do with anything but the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he who now now has is not thine husband in that set is thou truly now he's showing the sign of Messiah the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet amen the resulting issue of what of what was going on in this conversation this woman now after after the sign of Messiah amen after the messiah messiah was given this woman could see right in front of her the sign of Messiah coming through the prayer lines it raised her to the place she realized she was in the presence of something other than Humanity she was in the presence of something other than and greater than brother Branham or a prophet she was in the presence of of God Amen this woman began to realize she was in a presence different she was in a presence that that transcended Humanity in carnally she was in the presence of God and she said unto him sir I perceived that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain see now now when she says this she reverts back to the one thing that that she could remember and that came back to her how many times you witnessed a people and they're living horrible lives maybe they're in horrible situations but you just got an inkling or talk to him about the Lord just a little bit and they and and that person invariably most of the time if they don't just uh uh push brush you off they revert back to the one time or the one place or the one situation or the one church service or the one Bible scripture or something that they revert back to that they remember that was about Christianity that was about God that was about something greater and more than the life they were living at the time this woman has got to that place she's now reverting back too so there was a time in her life where there was something spoke to her about we'll just say religion or God liness because when God when Jesus begins to speak to her like this her she reverts because she really thou art a prophet and she reverts back to that thing that she knew our fathers Worship in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship doesn't sound like a red like woman she's not speaking like the light that she's living why because she's not the life that she's living she's a child of God and God's about to show her that yes she's about to realize that and that representation that was always in her is about to take hold and she starts and she's going to begin to realize now who she really is praise the Lord oh I I think about her but you know what I think more than that is me I think about myself and I think about what the Lord did for me and where he brought me from him too and I thought and when it come to the realization and the Revelation that you're more than what you have become praise God Amen when God reveals that to you Saints there's not a devil in hell can rob that from you yes there's not a devil I hell that can try to steal that from you or get you to disbelieve or see anything different because you know that you're a child of God that in you always in you was this representation was this God that was always there that seed of life that seed of God that was that attribute of God was always there and it finally come to the place of realization and like I said the other day you start to begin to I did start to begin to understand why I was the way I was why did the things I did as a boy why act the way I did and why I felt different and why I never felt as good of friends as I had growing up why I knew that I was not like them I knew I wasn't like them I knew I wasn't a part of them they were my best friends and I'd love anything in the world to try to lead them to Christ today if they aren't already I hope they are amen but I knew I was different you know there's something she knew there's something there and she starts to realize this and she speaks to Jesus Christ God almighty and flesh in front of her Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we worship uh we know what we worship for salvations of the Jews but the hour coming and now is see the transition yes amen the transition's already in place now is when the true worshipers amen just like sister matisse's song the true worshipers is that you amen praise the Lord the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him what is that worship that worship is the Dynamics in the mechanics yes the Dynamics is the spirit and the mechanics is the truth those that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth we are led by the spirit through the word of God amen God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth praise God the spirit the Holy Spirit and the truth of God's word mechanics and Dynamics working together to fire this machine that God has created on this Earth for us to live now we walk by God we walk by the spirit not by the flesh amen by the spirit is how we walk remember that we walk by the spirit that's how we walk that's how we live our lives by the spirit of God that leads us because that little germ that was in you was to be you from before the foundation of the world has found you and now that life is common is living in you that leads you and guides you into all truth it's happening to this woman right here amen the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah comes see now she's going back I know that she's reaching back she's she's going back before these five husbands and the one she's living with it's not her husband she's going back before all that any of that all those things that she went through amen the woman said I know the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he I'm he I'm the Messiah amen one of the very few places in the scripture you'll find that brother that that Jesus Christ actually tells and admits to someone he is that Messiah yes amen I that speak to thee am he he is that Messiah praise the Lord and upon this came his disciples and Marvel that he talked with this woman yet no man said what seeketh thou or why talk is thou with her it's very unusual obviously two two reasons two main reasons this was very unusual again like we said the two main reasons the one the the Jews and Samaritans had no dealings they were considered unclean the Jews were not supposed to have any kind of dealings with those that were considered unclean amen but remember in I think it's in Acts where Jesus where God speaks to Peter and says consider no man unclean go to all world go to all the world go to All Nations don't consider them unclean go give them the gospel go tell them about Jesus go tell them about me don't consider them unclean don't stay away from them do what you can to help them to save them to to preach the gospel to them amen but at that time it was considered uh uh unclean it was considered not acceptable not to mention the fact that she of course was a woman of the old Fame she'd had these husbands and it were hers and she was living that read that life of of a harlot at the time he and look now at 27th verse and and upon this came his disciples marveled and what seek is thou or why talk us without her he they didn't ask the woman that left her water park pot and went her way into the City and saith to the men say it to the men now this was absolutely something forbidden for a woman of her stature to go and talk to these men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this is not this the Christ amen amen then they went out of the city and came unto him her her confession her uh our testimony was so compelling so believable that these men listen to her a woman that they weren't even supposed to talk to her she talked to them have no dealings at all they listened her she was so convincing and compelling they actually listened and went to find out who she was talking about that's that's pretty outstanding amen in the meanwhile's disciples prayed him saying Master E and he said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not of we'll talk about that meat again a little bit thereof said the uh therefore said the APO the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat they're thinking carnal Jesus said unto them my meat is what to do the will of him that sent me praise God that's our me our meat is to do God's will that's how we live that's how we survive that's what our sustaining substance is is uh that is our meat is to do the will of God Amen that's why we're here that's our purpose in life and that's what that's the number one Focus that we have is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work to finish his word no wonder Jesus cried on the cross and is finished when he was taking his last breath and said it is finished the work of God that God had for him to accomplish was finished at that time amen but you recognized it wasn't just Jesus Paul himself said I have run the course I have kept the faith I have I have uh run the race I have uh now it's time that might be offered up my I have finished my course my time is over I have accomplished what God has put me on this Earth to accomplish and I'm ready to be offered up not just Paul either for every one of us there's work that God remember I said God has the work that he's working in every one of us and we want to do everything we can as long as there's breath in our body to complete the work to finish the work that God has called and commissioned for us to do it wasn't just Jesus that had a word it wasn't just him that had a work that was to be finished every one of us have a work that we work something we do our lives the will of God to be uh to be exemplified from us and to be accomplished through us to the point that we can get to the place that Paul was and see I've I have can't I've run the race I have kept the faith I'm ready to be offered up I finished my course I've done what God has asked me to do I have led by his spirit and whatever he's had for me to do I've done it finish his work say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh Harvest behold I say unto you lift up your eyes and look at the fields for their white already to harvest and he uh and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gather fruit unto the light unto life eternal both he that soweth and he that readeth may gather Rejoice together and herein is that same true one soweth and another man wreath it I sent you to read that whereon ye bestow no labor other men labored and ye are entered into their labors now listen to this last verse is 39th verse I should say and many many of the Samaritans of that City believed on Jesus believed on him for the same of the woman raise the Lord which Justified he told me all that ever I did they were saved they recognized Christ and received life because of her testimony it doesn't say that they that they uh believe because of him because of Jesus but because of the woman saying the saying of the woman praise the Lord how many Souls now be accounted to her because of what she did there on that day it doesn't matter what her background was doesn't matter what she gonna do didn't matter what her past was like amen that was irrelevant at the point amen the point was that Jesus found her because he had to go through some and when he found her he spoke to her he energized or or brought to life that that that representation that was always in her that she saw something and it was so real and so convincing and so true and so compelling that she told the men of that City and many of that City come to be Believers on Jesus Christ because of her testimony amen reminds me of that washed woman brother Bradham talked about that little wash woman is a minister coming through town and she she washed clothes for like a dime a week or something and she's a little watched when I saw she did she washed clothes her whole life that was her whole living and she heard about this Minister that was coming and she wanted to be a help and he was coming to town and she washed woman and and she was doing all she can and she gave up she gave what she could to try to help support this man and nobody came it was it was a a barn and hardly anybody noticed hardly anybody cared it was insignificant to the world standards uh which most of the time any work of God really is any work of God generally is insignificant to the world standards but there was something in her heart that she wanted to do for God so she tried and she tried to do what she can to try to help this and and and through her efforts one little young boy coming he sat in the back and this preacher preached and when he got done this little boy came up to the Altar and gave his life to Jesus Christ amen that little boy turned out to be Dwight Moody Dwight Moody who led how many half a million souls to Jesus Christ that little woman she went back to washing clothes for a dime a week but every soul that came as a result of Dwight Moody is going to be on her account amen for what she did for that at that time for that meeting to bring that boy to Jesus Christ amen you never know Saints all we do is what we do with the Lord wash wash wash do something for God and just continue on life amen she probably now she may have never even known but God had a work for her to do and she fulfills that that was in her heart to do amen just like this woman there was something in her that called out there was a representation something that represented look that represents it it's something if you think about in the worldly standards uh someone that represents you probably the greatest example we have is maybe in court with a lawyer a lawyer is something that uh that that uh someone either hires or is appointed to you by the state it's someone it's it's someone who is supposed to stand for you someone who's supposed to speak on your behalf someone is supposed to have your best interest at heart someone who's supposed to stand in proxy to represent what you think and what you feel and what you've been through it and everything about it everything about a situation or your life that person is supposed to represent you in that capacity before a judge that that judge May recognize by the spokesman who this person really is amen that representation that is in you is something that speaks for you every day it stands on your behalf and in Acts and it speaks on your behalf is something that you can identify with an identity like being heirs we sang the song being Heirs of the father Heirs of God Heirs of one another it's an identity we have names that we have we have surnames mine's Bennett uh Katie different names we have surnames that we go by and and those names are something that identifies Who We Are it doesn't it transcends just being a human or or even even George Newton Bennett III it transcends being a Bennett or a Newton Bennett it's something that identifies me personally it separates me even from my dad because he was Junior and I'm third makes me a separate individual is something we identify with being a child of God being a part of the family of God is an identity that you have it's a representation that you have that shows this is who you really are you're not this person that the world has carved out or what you were when you were born or your childhood or something you are really truly a son or daughter of God through God's representation identifying now before the Throne of God but Before the Throne of God what stands in your place you have an advocate you you have a representative you have something that stands there before you and God amen I know people want to to this day they want to they try so hard to get that blood off the emergency friend but every time I read the scripture I see what brother Branham preached I look at God's revealing of me to the word all I can see is that precious blood laying there is my Advocate that stands between me and God you know brother random said God can't even hear your prayers if that blood's not there the only way your prayer your words can get through to God it's because you have an advocate you have a representative that's standing there on your behalf that shows that this person is not what the world says they are it's not who the devil says they are this is a child of God amen and when God looks through that red blood to the Red Sin it's white as snow yes you are Justified as though you never did it yes without spot wrinkle or blemish before God almighty your representative that's what a representative is look brother Ram talks about this one on one part of the little story that we just read identified Christ of all ages 1964. now what I'm speaking here to a person [Music] who actually cannot receive it there's nothing in them to receive from the Bible says that she lives in pleasure she is dead while she is alive why was it why was these Pharisees look at Jesus he was the manifested word of God we believe that the Bible says he was well watch when he done his Masonic sign the Pharisees that had a little bit of light they had there was good people lived a good religious life they had they actually had a little light about them they had organized themselves into a priesthood they had a little light but down in the bottom of their hearts they had no Eternal representation in glory so when they seen that Supernatural done they said this man is the devil look at just the opposite just the opposite of when he did the exact same thing in the presence of the woman of Samaria on the old Fame woman a woman who no one had wanted to have anything to do with for her her life that she was living they wanted to keep their children as far away from this woman as they possibly could yet in her was that representation you know brother Brent God told Brother random because many times brother random lashed out at the sin of the world called the young people the rickies and rickettas and God rebuked him one day and said quit calling them that some of them is my children amen we don't know that we we see it and we we we can't look beyond that Veil right sometimes to see what's down in there it's representation but they here had no representation so when life presented itself what did they do they rejected it they had no representation in glory they called him a devil he showed the Masonic sign and they called him a devil but here was a little ill-fained woman a prostitute but down in her heart she had a representation of one of God's thoughts that's that seed praise the Lord that attribute of God there she was wait in sin but when she seen that happen she said sir I believe the thou art a prophet I know the Messiah coming and Jesus said I am he praise the Lord he said I am he and she threw down on her water pot and the only thing she was thinking about was letting other people know that she had found or she had ran across the Messiah that they've been praying for for hundreds of years that was prophesied by Isaiah here he is I've met him he did exactly what the scripture said he would do now look what they did in Matthew chapter 12. um Matthew chapter 12. now look God's gonna come by everybody's path everybody has a chance at Salvation if they don't God's not a just God if anybody says that God in some way sometimes has ever passed their way some way some capacity God has to come by every everybody's way in some way at some time God crosses everybody's path and gives everybody a chance to repent everyone has that opportunity now look Matthew chapter 12 let's begin reading verse 22. then was brought unto him one possessed with the Devil blinded dumb and he healed him in so much that the Blind and dumb both spoke and saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of David they can't get past that car now that carnality that Humanity the woman at the well didn't either she said the same thing she was she was in and she was in the line of carnation Humanity that's all she was thinking about but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow this fellow does not cast out Devils but by Beelzebub the prince of devils calling him the devil and Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and that's where this country is as this country is about the fall friend that she's completely divided and if Satan not to mention she's under curse anyway and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if I by Beelzebub cast out Devils by hunting her children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges mine he's laying it out for him but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God Has Come unto you just like he told the woman at the well amen he told them I am he they've been looking for messiah praying for messiah I am he she believed him they called him a devil if if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is coming to you or or how else or or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he first by the strong man and then he will spoil his house praise the lord it's all we do many times though we say Satan you have no right here Satan take your hands off Satan you've lost this battle Satan you must go you're bind that strong man amen then what comes healing or Deliverance whatever it is whatever the prayer is about you bind that strong man and then you take from praise the Lord he that is uh he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad now they called him a devil the woman at the well called him Messiah they had no representation they had no identity there was nothing to identify them to him even though he did the same thing as he did with the woman at the well you see when that light strikes that those that receive it and believe it and those that reject it and call it something other than what it is a devil they have no representation the people of the world they do the exact same thing unfortunately seems like nowadays um the the representation is getting fewer and far between yes because almost anybody you talk to anymore they don't want to have anything to do with anything of God they might have known something they might have heard something their parents might have took them to school or to church excuse me or something but they but that's there's nothing there to hold there's no identification there's no Advocate there's no representation if there's no representation of what is left nothing there to identify with brother Adam said here they have nothing to represent them in glory no representation Amen to what did they have had nothing but Humanity carnality nothing but the Devil Himself look future home notice when Jesus came and manifested the word because the word discerned the thoughts that was in the heart as Hebrew 4 said it would the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and he came as the son of man the prophet what happened this priest with only intellectual learning said he's a devil because that's what his denomination called it what did it do he had no representation so it blocked him out now listen friend if you only if the only thing you've got is just intellectual learning you get something different from that and you'll never be able to get it unless you've got Eternal representation that's the reason I believe they come from the east west north south they come to hear the word of God not a message to tickle their intake at their intellect their intelligence not something to make them feel good or to go out and say oh everything's great and Grand something that anchors down into their soul a word that might scour them out but help them understand I'm something greater than what this world says or what I even see even when I look in the mirror that's something God has made there's a desire to me I'm fill the pull I know that God is working and proving and showing in me that he's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever one more scripture I want to read in John chapter 6. John chapter six I'll try to just read through this without as much to speak but again that's just me I don't know what the Lord has in store but listen uh John chapter 6 uh let's just uh let's begin with verse 24. When the People therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when cometh thou hither Jesus answered them and said very verily I say unto you see ye seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and Loaves and were filled labor not for the meat here we go with the meat again with the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give you for him hath God the Father sealed what does that mean again in your life doing the will of God amen there's substantive sustaining value in doing the will of God the spiritual life of your of your human being is sustained by doing the will of God Amen not the will of man not your own will praise the Lord you notice when when uh I may be getting ahead of myself for another sermon but when God chose Saul Saul was fine and did everything did what God told him to do but then he got pridefully with Spirit come on he got prideful and he started doing all his own will and what he wanted to do and God had to take him out amen then said they unto him what shall we do that mean that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he has sent you believe and you live and that word comes through you out of you and the will of God is manifested through you that's the work of God that's the mean of God they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee or what does thou work our fathers that eat Manna in the desert uh as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life into the world and he said unto him and they said unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread now they're doing the exact same thing the woman at the world did she said give me this water they're saying give me this bread but notice as the as the conversation continues on as brother Ram set that girl off to the side as Jesus began to ask the man of the woman about her husband they he began to get deeper into their soul to realize who they were or what they were they want the bread Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life that cometh uh that I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he said believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all the all that the father giveth me shall come to me and in him that come and to him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out for I come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which he has sent me that of all uh of all which he hath given me I shall lose nothing but shall raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day now when she said I see that your Messiah the Messiah is supposed to come and tell us these things I am he he says this to these people these religious group and they said the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which come down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he said I come down from heaven notice the difference the representation of one versus the others they murdered among themselves Jesus answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man could come to me except the father has sent which sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day what is that drawing that's that representation it is written in the prophets and they and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man has seen the father save he which is of god he has seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that bread of life your fathers didn't eat man of the Wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which come now from Heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world now the Jews therefore stroke among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat again they have not gotten the Revelation they're still simply carnal right thinking about flesh and blood Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except to eat the Flesh of the son of man or drink his blood you have no life In You whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drinking deep ameneth My Flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he eateth meat even he shall live by me this is that bread which come down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever these things said he uh he in the synagogue as he told in Capernaum many therefore many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard say who can hear it when Jesus him knew it himself at his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up from where he was before if it it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I say unto you they are spirit and they are life they are mechanics and they are dynamics yes but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they would believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore I said I unto you that no man can come unto me except he is given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him who can stand this who can take this seat saying who can hear this that's what you get a lot of times for the people of the world today yes oh I see it how can anybody live that message how can anybody believe that message how can anybody go about what that message that word that Prophet brought how can anybody live that the bride can live it right because she's become it it is her she's living who she is solely on the fact that she's become the word yeah yeah she can hear it because she believes it she's it amen they walked with now look what he turned back to his disciples to the twelve will you go away also also go away then Simon Peter answered in one of the greatest answers I've ever heard in the scripture Lord to whom shall we go praise God amen where else can we go friend it's like I said if I didn't know that full and feel that pulled and know God I what is life is it anymore with living anymore what's the point of even living there what's the point being here if he's gone away and left me I'm nothing Cannon Potter amen but Peter says well then where where could we go where else can we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe that thou art and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God I can imagine at the same time Peter's probably looking over at his roses and saying what in the world is he talking about I don't know Peter you're the spokes and you should know I have no idea I haven't heard him talk like this before what is he even saying I don't even know what he's talking about how could this happen how could this be Peter do you believe I believe Lord you have the words of eternal life where else can we go I don't know what he's talking about but you know they came to the point that they did amen as they continue to walk with Christ even though they didn't understand it as they continued to walk with Christ God continued to reveal it to them they come the point that they did understand and God did show them and God did reveal to them he even told Peter one time when you were converted then you can strengthen the brothers because he knew it came to him and he knew by Revelation it wasn't about learning Jesus told him Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you but my Father in Heaven amen had to be something beyond that it was God living through him that representation broken system no pumping the the well that comes up that that Artesian well its power is within itself it needs no priming yes sir its own life is in itself that's the way the seed of God is in a man's heart praise the Lord that's the way the seed of God is in a man's heart the life of God is within you the individual not the church it's in you you're the one that has the germ of life living in you amen it's that germ of life that's in you that found you that is who you really are that representation the representation of God that is in you you've always had it amen remember how could it have come at that specific time when when the Bible speaks brother Branham Talk of the representation that God had put in you and you come to that place like that Samaritan woman and recognize what it was yes religious people huge groups churches denominations schools teach people how to preach how to be a Christian but it's God in his word that reveals itself to you yes one moment you may not have a single clue in the next moment God drops it down all of a sudden it's quick into your heart and you thank God praise the lord well there it is amen I remember one time I won't go into it that I questioned and I and there's other other very pronounced uh Brothers in this message ministers pastors and I I hear certain things that were preaching on like I just it just doesn't that just doesn't I can't fit that I I just I tried Saints I really wanted to I looked up to these men yeah and I just but I just couldn't yeah yeah and then and then when God quickened something to me it was so contrary to so much of the things that I had been listening to but it matched the word yes and it matched the message not just a quote here or there but it matched it all the way through yeah it matched the scripture not just to not just a a scripture or two a verse or two but it matched all the way through and when it got to that place that a message said this has got to be it I didn't come up with this I I didn't finagle this or trying to learn this by some education there's just that time when God dropped it and that finalized it for me it didn't matter if it was contrary to what uh all the others saying or anybody else that's not it it's God individual to me it's God individual to you that is your representation in heaven that you in glory have to have a representative an advocate praise the Lord and it stands for you amen Let's Dance we have a high priest that is touched praise God he's an advocate for us that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities our needs every situation of our life he is mindful of amen he knows it am I praise God and he's faithful to do so yes he is praise the Lord I'm so glad that representation still speaks to us today yes didn't just speak one time I don't think it spoke to this woman at the well just that one time it is made it spoke to her all the rest of her life amen it doesn't say but I would guarantee that woman never went back to that husband that wasn't hers right amen praise the Lord because it was something different about it her life had changed then praise God I'm glad I have an advocate that stands for me aren't you praise the Lord let's stand if we could he is our representation he is on life I couldn't afford him there was no way no way I could have afforded him it would have been Way Beyond any amount of money I could have ever amen he was given to me praise God and I'm so thankful he was given to me to be my Advocate to stand in my place to speak on my behalf praise the Lord amen let's sing this course this psalm 591. and I have it amen sing it to the Lord Jesus Who I Am Lord who I am 591 amen oh glorious victory that day he set
