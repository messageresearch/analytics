[31:37] Believers in this day yes we have to
[31:40] watch you even said in U in Matthew 25
[31:45] when you were speaking about those 10
[31:48] virgins five are wise five are foolish

[45:37] while she was real concerned beginning
[45:40] of last week and you might have to go
[45:44] back I said let's pray keep believing
[45:47] now it's prac clear up amen praise the
[45:51] Lord amen wonderful I just love it when
[45:54] prayer requests become praise reports
[45:57] amen praise the Lord God is good go
[46:01] ahead brother D um I want to thank God
[46:04] for um turning our apartment complexes
[46:07] on there's better people now and it's a
[46:10] little more peaceful you've gotten all
[46:12] the rift raft out of there and it's a
[46:17] lot more comfortable it's gated now so
[46:21] it's been a blessing amen praise the
[46:24] Lord wonderful I want to thank the Lord
[46:27] last uh was it sunay Sunday night Monday
[46:31] night can't remember now that big storm
[46:33] came through and knocked over probably
[46:36] 15 Big Trees in our complex and it most
[46:40] the apartments were spared really I
[46:42] think all the apartments was SP just
[46:44] maybe one hit a little one of the
[46:46] walkways down hit some mailboxes crushed
[46:48] a couple of cars but everyone was safe
[46:51] and I'm thankful that uh we lost power
[46:54] for a few hours but it wasn't any worse
[46:55] than that so appreciate the lord always
[46:58] taking care of us and they uh year or so
[47:01] ago they chopped down one of the big
[47:02] trees right by our apartment and I
[47:04] didn't like it we love we like that tree
[47:06] it was nice good shape uh but I told my
[47:10] wife the other night I said well you
[47:12] never know why the Lord I mean he could
[47:14] have orchestrated those people to chop
[47:16] it down because that could have come
[47:18] crashed in on us the other night so you
[47:20] never know why things happen sometimes
[47:23] things happen the way we don't like them
[47:25] or things happen that we don't want to
[47:27] happen but God's always watching over us
[47:29] so we got to sometimes be careful of
[47:33] what we're critical of because it maybe
[47:35] the Lord orchestrating something to keep
[47:37] you safe so I'm thankful for that so
[47:40] praise the Lord for being good to us so
[47:43] amen let's stand to our feet if we could
[47:46] amen and we'll uh turn to the scripture
[47:49] we'll go to Isaiah chapter
[47:50] 54 Isaiah chapter 54
[47:57] we'll just read one verse of scripture
[47:58] and I will be honest with you I was kind
[48:00] of
[48:01] influenced u i i I tried to dismiss it a
[48:04] couple of times uh just as something
[48:06] that had come in my mind but uh the Lord
[48:09] wouldn't let me do it and then yesterday
[48:10] when I come and sit down uh other
[48:13] scriptures came so I felt this was the
[48:15] will of the Lord but I was inspired uh
[48:17] by what happened last Saturday uh with
[48:21] uh a former president and and what had
[48:24] happened to him and the things that a
[48:26] lot of the things that seem to lead up
[48:28] to uh really keeping him safe that's the
[48:32] way I view it anyway so I guess
[48:35] different people view it different ways
[48:36] but that's the way I view it in fact uh
[48:40] he actually gave God thanks and gave God
[48:42] praise glory for saving him sparing him
[48:46] and I don't think I can't remember maybe
[48:48] it has in my lifetime any president
[48:52] giving glory to God for anything that I
[48:54] can remember anyway now I could be m
[48:56] mistaken and if I am you can tell me
[48:58] later but that's the first time I think
[49:00] I've ever even seen hardly a president
[49:03] elicit the name of God first of all but
[49:06] uh to acknowledge that he wouldn't even
[49:09] be here without God's the amazing grace
[49:12] of God I think is put or something like
[49:14] that anyway so uh I want to go Isaiah
[49:17] 54:17 so it's kind of inspiring to me uh
[49:22] because uh you can if you're a Christian
[49:25] you can see the hand of of God moving uh
[49:28] but we also make sure that we can see
[49:31] the hand of God moving in our lives yes
[49:33] amen and see how God Is Watching Over Us
[49:36] and keeping us and how many times and
[49:37] how many things and how many ways things
[49:40] could happen that God helps us with and
[49:42] prevents and takes care of us friends
[49:44] there's probably there's probably tens
[49:46] there's probably countless number of
[49:48] things that could happen to us that the
[49:51] Lord doesn't allow that we never even
[49:54] know about yes right that don't even
[49:56] ever you know the tree that's one thing
[49:59] that came to my mind but how many things
[50:01] like that the Lord does protecting us
[50:03] keeping us that we may not even know
[50:06] that it was the hand of the Lord
[50:08] orchestrating things in a different way
[50:10] to keep us safe yes and to keep us bless
[50:13] prosperous whatever it is so um Isaiah
[50:16] 54:17 I want to read just this one verse
[50:18] of scripture Isaiah 5417 very very
[50:22] familiar very popular scripture before
[50:25] we read it though can we just our heads
[50:27] for another word of prayer Lord Jesus we
[50:29] are very thankful again lord of the
[50:31] grace that you give yes for the
[50:33] blessings and love that you show to us
[50:35] Lord and we're so appreciated Lord that
[50:37] we can know and have by faith that God
[50:39] your hand is upon us that you've blessed
[50:42] us you've helped us you've strengthened
[50:44] us along the way even through our
[50:46] frailties and our humanity and our
[50:48] mistakes and our ignorance Lord
[50:50] sometimes God you still everything that
[50:53] you do for us overrides every bit of
[50:55] that to keep us protected in your in
[50:58] your hands Lord in your protection we
[51:01] thank you Lord for blessing us again
[51:03] with another beautiful day for another
[51:05] service Lord to be here today God to
[51:07] worship and to praise you and God to
[51:10] give you thanks and praise for Lord
[51:12] without you none of this would be
[51:13] possible yes God I pray you bless these
[51:16] people those that have come today Lord
[51:18] those who may not have been able to make
[51:19] it those who may be streaming Lord may
[51:22] your hand of Mercy rest upon each one of
[51:24] us God we rebuke every demonic spirit
[51:27] that would try to hurt hinder and
[51:28] filtrate this service in any way that
[51:31] you get the glory honor and praise for
[51:33] all that is done and said here in this
[51:35] service and Lord I'm just so thankful of
[51:37] all the testimonies all the things that
[51:40] Lord that's spoken that we know that you
[51:42] do for us Lord but God it is given and
[51:44] orally that we can see your hand upon
[51:47] our lives and God we give you thanks and
[51:50] praise for it Lord so now we just pray
[51:52] God your your hand Lord would move on
[51:55] this service as you would see f God lord
[51:57] we are your instruments use us as you
[51:59] see fit and Lord give us that Grace Lord
[52:03] that we need for the remaining part of
[52:05] this service speak through these lips
[52:07] minister to our hearts our ears God and
[52:09] help us grow closer to you we just be
[52:12] careful to give you the thanks and
[52:13] praise for it all in the name of the
[52:15] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[52:20] one Ser one one scripture again Isaiah
[52:24] 54:17 says no weapon weapon that is
[52:27] formed against thee shall prosper and
[52:29] every tongue that shall rise against
[52:31] thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this
[52:33] is the heritage of the Servants of the
[52:35] Lord and their righteousness is in is of
[52:38] me sayeth the Lord you can be seated if
[52:40] you'd like and I wanted to speak on this
[52:43] is no weapon no weapon formed will
[52:46] prosper no weapon will
[52:48] prosper that was kind of the thought of
[52:50] the title that I wanted to bring but
[52:52] when I started looking at this scripture
[52:54] it really opened up to a whole lot more
[52:56] than just that if you actually break
[52:59] down to look at the scripture so many
[53:01] times uh it speaks of things in ways
[53:04] that uh many times we don't recognize or
[53:07] or understand or read thoroughly or read
[53:09] what it say uh I was be done on Earth
[53:13] absolutely but my my look at it is that
[53:16] when I when you break it down and you
[53:18] actually read what it's saying when he
[53:20] says in Earth I'm a part of that Earth
[53:23] that I want God's will to be done in not
[53:26] on I want his will to be done in this
[53:30] Earth because we are part of the earth
[53:32] our bodies come from the elements of the
[53:34] earth and I want his will to be done in
[53:37] earth as it has already been done in
[53:40] heaven as he has already seen it's
[53:42] already been in his mind before the
[53:43] foundation of the world God had that
[53:46] attribute of me who I was who I was to
[53:48] be come forth into this world to let his
[53:51] will that he's already seen be done in
[53:53] earth amen someone would say in the
[53:57] Earth or on the earth is the same thing
[53:58] not to me and if you go read the
[54:01] scripture exactly the way it says it
[54:03] really sometimes can open up things to
[54:06] you that you really didn't see before
[54:08] and when I read this scripture yesterday
[54:10] it it kind of exploded to me I just be
[54:12] honest with you it says no weapon that
[54:15] is formed against the against thee now
[54:18] notice what what Isaiah is saying here
[54:21] is that a weapon or weapons are being
[54:25] formed specifically against you right
[54:30] amen not just a weapon that's formed but
[54:33] it says no weapon formed against thee
[54:37] right so that weapon has your name on it
[54:41] that bomb that that uh uh whatever
[54:44] Satan's trying to devise against you has
[54:46] your name on it it is a signed for you
[54:50] but notice what it says that weapon that
[54:53] is formed against you personally and you
[54:57] know the devil has a I mean brother said
[54:59] he's got that punch coming right he's
[55:02] got that and he says he's entitled to
[55:04] that punch but that weapon that is
[55:07] formed
[55:09] specifically against you look now shall
[55:14] not
[55:15] Prosper praise the Lord now look a
[55:18] weapon a weapon is an instrument of
[55:21] War when when a when a weapon is formed
[55:24] against you personally that's a
[55:27] declaration of war that that weapon that
[55:30] has got your name on it that the devil
[55:32] has devised against you has your
[55:35] personal name on it has has been
[55:37] assigned for you specifically declaring
[55:41] war against you right amen I told you a
[55:44] couple weeks ago how I feel about
[55:47] that I told you exactly how I feel about
[55:50] the devil coming after me and I trust
[55:53] you feel same way devil tries to come
[55:55] after you he has nothing to do with me
[55:58] that devil has absolutely nothing to do
[56:00] with me has no control over me cannot do
[56:03] anything to me that God doesn't allow
[56:06] amen he has no right to me he has no
[56:09] rights to anything he has he has nothing
[56:12] on me he has nothing on you yes but
[56:16] there are weapons that are formed that
[56:18] they bring that are specifically
[56:21] tailored and detailed for you that's why
[56:25] that brother B talk Al about having that
[56:27] weak spot he says now he's got that
[56:30] punch coming and he's entitled to that
[56:32] punch and he knows exactly where your
[56:35] weakest point is that's why we are to
[56:38] try to keep that covered at all times
[56:41] right amen you know if a boxer goes into
[56:45] an arena that boxer studies his opponent
[56:48] for a long time yeah to find out his
[56:51] idioc secrecies and the way he operates
[56:54] and does he go right or does he go left
[56:56] or is he undercut or is he a jab guy
[56:59] what is what is his movements what is
[57:02] his tactics what does he do to try to
[57:04] get through just even maybe one single
[57:07] punch to to knock you out right and
[57:11] they'll study that and they'll make sure
[57:13] say well this guy comes into the right
[57:15] so the trainer is going to tell that guy
[57:17] he says now this guy comes into the
[57:19] right a lot make sure you keep that side
[57:21] covered right make sure you you do
[57:24] everything to make sure that now you
[57:25] want stay covered completely but that
[57:29] weak spot that weak point that you have
[57:33] to try to stay covered at all times
[57:35] because trust me friend the weapon he
[57:38] has formed against you and against you
[57:41] and against you against you is a
[57:43] different weapon that he has formed for
[57:45] me right and vice versa and all around
[57:48] is different because we're all different
[57:50] people we all have different situations
[57:53] life different weaknesses different weak
[57:55] points so every weapon that is formed is
[57:58] specifically formed for you to hit that
[58:02] spot that's what he's looking for the
[58:05] most and greatest vulnerability any good
[58:08] general of any War would want to try to
[58:10] make sure to hit the weakest spot that
[58:13] the opponent has so the other guy looks
[58:17] and says okay what is this guy when
[58:19] you're going when you're going on
[58:21] offense what is it that you want to that
[58:23] you want to do will an uppercut get him
[58:26] is he weaker on his right is he weaker
[58:28] on his left amen I know I did that
[58:31] backwards but that's because when you're
[58:32] punching from the right you're guarding
[58:33] with your left so anyway I just want to
[58:35] make sure say he doesn't know his left
[58:37] and his right yeah I do it's just when
[58:38] you're punching from the right you guard
[58:40] with your left so anyway so is he coming
[58:43] in and and which way can you get him
[58:46] which way can you attack him amen
[58:48] there's a midsection blow does that bend
[58:50] him over you know and try to figure the
[58:53] person out the the opponent out to know
[58:55] exactly where it looks friends that's
[58:57] exactly what the devil does yeah amen
[59:01] yes if not if but when he has his little
[59:06] minions out studying you he studies
[59:09] every part about you everything about
[59:11] you is studyed he knows exactly where
[59:14] you're weakest he knows exactly where
[59:17] your vulnerabilities are he knows
[59:18] exactly where to attack you sometimes
[59:21] win remember uh uh like I said I was
[59:24] kind of inspired by what happened uh
[59:27] Saturday a week ago uh I heard that this
[59:32] kid yes kid I I'm old enough now to call
[59:35] a 20-year-old kid this
[59:38] kid studied the place from what I hear
[59:41] now studied the place hid a weapon flew
[59:46] a drone over the
[59:49] location I mean this this kid did his
[59:51] homework yeah he
[59:54] knew he had had devised his plan to know
[59:58] when to do it where to do it how to do
[1:00:02] it and how he could possibly get the
[1:00:05] best opportunity to assassinate a
[1:00:09] president amen he had done his homework
[1:00:11] I give that to him smart guy from what I
[1:00:13] hear smart kid a very smart kid um
[1:00:19] uh very nice kid from what I hear but uh
[1:00:23] all that aside my point is he studied to
[1:00:26] make sure to get the best opportunity
[1:00:29] possible and look friend as a human
[1:00:32] that's one thing but look when we're
[1:00:34] fighting against principalities and
[1:00:36] spirits of the air that's a whole
[1:00:38] different ball game right that's a whole
[1:00:40] different situation to make sure that we
[1:00:42] know that we have every possible place
[1:00:46] that the devil could get to covered and
[1:00:50] taken care of and fortify fortify that
[1:00:53] place fortify it with prayer fortif it
[1:00:56] with with with discipline in your life
[1:00:58] fortify it with reading with with with h
[1:01:02] with listening to the word with every
[1:01:05] spiritual uh attribute you can Garner in
[1:01:08] your life make sure and keep that place
[1:01:10] covered don't let the devil get even
[1:01:13] just a wedge in there because all he has
[1:01:15] to do is get a wedge to open the door
[1:01:17] wide open that weapon now that's
[1:01:21] specifically for you it's got your name
[1:01:24] on it is is a declaration of
[1:01:27] war now if the devil is declaring war on
[1:01:32] you what are you going to do about
[1:01:34] it what is your reaction do we cower
[1:01:38] over in the corner and just beg the
[1:01:39] devil not
[1:01:41] to do we just lay down and just take it
[1:01:44] just just roll
[1:01:47] over just let the devil have the V what
[1:01:50] what are we going to do about it amen
[1:01:53] what do we do cuz we know the Bible says
[1:01:56] that this declaration of war that has G
[1:01:59] I can guarantee you every one of us here
[1:02:02] has a declaration of war with your name
[1:02:04] on it a weapon with your name on it the
[1:02:06] war has been declared trust me he's not
[1:02:09] just well the devil just doesn't look at
[1:02:12] you and say well uh they give their life
[1:02:15] to God they they they've been baptized
[1:02:18] they're a born again Christian so I
[1:02:20] guess I'll just leave them alone I
[1:02:22] nothing that's the last thing he's going
[1:02:24] to do right in fact you are the greater
[1:02:27] Target of anybody else amen anybody in
[1:02:31] the world you are the target you are the
[1:02:33] one she's looking to get to that weapon
[1:02:36] is an instrument of war is declaring war
[1:02:39] that weapon that is formed against
[1:02:42] you specifically you now look that
[1:02:46] weapon uh that is formed against
[1:02:51] thee oh I love
[1:02:53] this that weapon no weapon
[1:02:56] that is formed against thee shall
[1:02:59] prosper so none of them no matter what
[1:03:02] which direction he comes from no matter
[1:03:05] what he tries no matter what weapon he
[1:03:08] puts your name on it cannot Prosper
[1:03:12] right it cannot come again now look the
[1:03:15] word Prosper means to
[1:03:18] succeed or to overtake you or overwhelm
[1:03:22] you so understand that weapon that is
[1:03:25] formed against you cannot overthrow you
[1:03:30] it cannot succeed against you it cannot
[1:03:34] overwhelm you because we know the we
[1:03:40] know the devices of the enemy and we
[1:03:43] have its answer and his name is Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ so no now notice this is this is
[1:03:50] even in this is in Isaiah this is the
[1:03:52] Old Testament right the the the the
[1:03:55] Bible the portion of the Bible that a
[1:03:58] lot
[1:03:59] of people I almost call them Christians
[1:04:03] but people want to throw away well the
[1:04:05] Old Testament that does that's the Old
[1:04:08] Testament that doesn't count
[1:04:10] anymore oh really okay then then I guess
[1:04:14] we just have to throw this whole thing
[1:04:15] out then so I guess the weapons that are
[1:04:17] formed against you will prosper them I
[1:04:20] mean it it just doesn't make any logical
[1:04:22] sense people just want to pick what they
[1:04:24] want to pick and take what they want to
[1:04:26] take and throw the rest away and then
[1:04:28] then that's their choice but I want to
[1:04:29] take it all amen what the promises of
[1:04:32] God are for me I want them and no weapon
[1:04:35] no weapon that is formed against you can
[1:04:37] overcome you can can overwhelm you can
[1:04:41] succeed over you no weapon formed
[1:04:44] against you shall prosper yeah and and
[1:04:48] the best part to me look now it says and
[1:04:51] every tongue that shall rise against
[1:04:54] thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn is
[1:04:58] unrighteous of course but look what it
[1:05:01] says now it says this is I like that
[1:05:05] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[1:05:09] the Lord this is their
[1:05:12] Heritage you know what a Heritage is
[1:05:14] it's an inheritance it's a possession
[1:05:18] it's your portion your inheritance is
[1:05:21] your heritage and this this no weapon
[1:05:26] formed against you shall prosper is our
[1:05:28] right as a Christian it is our right as
[1:05:32] a as he says as a servant of the Lord uh
[1:05:35] because Christ hadn't come yet but we
[1:05:36] look down and say as a Christian this is
[1:05:39] my Heritage this is my right this is my
[1:05:44] inheritance this is my
[1:05:47] possession God has given me to
[1:05:50] possess the fact that no weapon formed
[1:05:54] against me can prosper yes is my
[1:05:57] possession so what now what do we do
[1:05:59] about
[1:06:01] it amen at this point it doesn't matter
[1:06:06] what the devil throws against you it
[1:06:08] cannot Prosper it cannot overwhelm you
[1:06:12] it will not succeed against you whatever
[1:06:14] he throws why because we are walking
[1:06:17] with the Lord yes because our lives are
[1:06:19] HID in him am brother Adam said I want
[1:06:22] to be so hid in Christ that Satan can't
[1:06:25] even find
[1:06:26] me praise the Lord exactly that's where
[1:06:30] we should all want to be doesn't mean
[1:06:32] that that weapon won't be formed against
[1:06:34] you amen but it does mean that it cannot
[1:06:38] Prosper it's my right as a Christian
[1:06:41] amen my
[1:06:43] inheritance my my uh my possession my
[1:06:47] possession praise the Lord you
[1:06:50] understand it belongs to us let's go
[1:06:54] over to Deuteronomy
[1:06:57] no weapon shall
[1:07:01] prosper and like we talked about the
[1:07:04] other
[1:07:05] day with just a couple of the idios
[1:07:07] secrecies
[1:07:09] that saved the president's life the
[1:07:12] former
[1:07:13] president amen just just a matter of
[1:07:18] speaking to people looking forward would
[1:07:22] have
[1:07:23] died billboard a thing set up to to look
[1:07:29] at of a visual aid he turns his head to
[1:07:34] look at that that helped because it made
[1:07:37] a smaller
[1:07:39] Target but then when he moved his head
[1:07:41] just a little
[1:07:44] bit people can say what they want for
[1:07:46] him but I believe in God Amen I heard
[1:07:50] people this week say that it is
[1:07:53] unchristian to say that God is with you
[1:07:55] you what yeah I heard I've heard news
[1:08:00] commentators people that should have
[1:08:02] people that should never ever ever have
[1:08:06] a microphone in front of their face
[1:08:08] ever say that God saying that God is
[1:08:13] with you is
[1:08:15] unchristian I thought if there's ever
[1:08:18] anything that is Christian amen is
[1:08:21] saying that God is always with me amen
[1:08:24] they literally said that and and I don't
[1:08:27] know if they consider themselves a
[1:08:28] Christian they said they were raised
[1:08:30] Catholic I don't know but I thought how
[1:08:32] unchristian a statement that is we
[1:08:35] always say how and give glory to God how
[1:08:38] he's with us and protects us and watches
[1:08:41] over us but it shows you in in a
[1:08:45] microcosm if you will of of of the way
[1:08:49] some things are headed in this country
[1:08:51] and it's coming against more and more
[1:08:54] against the Christian Christian belief
[1:08:57] amen it is absolutely true that we
[1:09:00] believe as Christians that God is with
[1:09:03] us amen so however people
[1:09:08] look but it's like I said just the
[1:09:10] slightest the slightest Tilt at the very
[1:09:14] Nan the bullets being
[1:09:17] fired was the difference between an ear
[1:09:19] and an
[1:09:20] eye amen now again as a Christian
[1:09:25] you can't convince me God's not in
[1:09:28] control right you'll never convince me
[1:09:31] God's not in charge amen and understand
[1:09:35] that it doesn't matter how much
[1:09:37] pre-planning was done how well it was
[1:09:40] done how great it was orchestrated even
[1:09:42] by a 20-year-old kid how great it was
[1:09:44] how perfect it will seem to be and the
[1:09:47] whole situation scenario set up no
[1:09:51] weapon no weapon it doesn't matter how
[1:09:54] good the devil's done it homework work
[1:09:55] it doesn't matter how much Weaponry what
[1:09:58] kind of weapons it doesn't matter if
[1:10:00] that weapon is earmarked for the weakest
[1:10:02] spots you got in your life it canot
[1:10:07] Prosper it cannot succeed against you he
[1:10:11] cannot touch or take your life that's
[1:10:14] right amen
[1:10:15] amen what is there to be afraid of right
[1:10:19] amen there's nothing to
[1:10:21] fear when God is with us there's nothing
[1:10:24] to fear God is always with us amen
[1:10:27] refuting that very statement I will God
[1:10:30] Is With Us amen Deuteronomy chapter
[1:10:38] 31 let's start with verse
[1:10:41] one I was just going to read a couple of
[1:10:43] verses of scripture out of this but
[1:10:45] since we got a little bit more time
[1:10:47] Deuteronomy 31 let give a little bit
[1:10:49] more background as we go a little
[1:10:51] further ahead so verse one and Moses
[1:10:53] went and spake these words unto all
[1:10:56] Israel and he said unto them I am 120
[1:11:00] years old this day I can no more go out
[1:11:02] and come in also the Lord has said unto
[1:11:06] me Thou shalt not go over this
[1:11:08] Jordan the Lord thy God he will go over
[1:11:12] before thee and he will destroy these
[1:11:15] nations from before thee and thou shalt
[1:11:18] possess
[1:11:19] them and Joshua he shall go over before
[1:11:23] thee as the Lord ha said
[1:11:26] and the Lord shall do unto them as he
[1:11:28] did to Sion and to OG Kings of the
[1:11:31] amorites and unto the land of them whom
[1:11:33] he destroyed and the Lord shall give
[1:11:36] them up before your face look at what
[1:11:39] God is
[1:11:40] doing shall give them up before your
[1:11:43] face that ye may do unto them according
[1:11:46] unto all the Commandments which I have
[1:11:48] commanded you amen now the promise is
[1:11:52] laid Moses give the promise
[1:11:56] I'm
[1:11:57] 120 I can't do this anymore plus God has
[1:12:01] said because of the smiting of the
[1:12:03] waters and all you will not go over but

[1:12:12] possess the land that I said they'll
[1:12:14] possess amen it don't matter the raming

[1:19:26] try to conform you to what they want you
[1:19:28] to be and where they want you to go and
[1:19:30] how they want you to act but we are not
[1:19:33] to
[1:19:34] fear fear is not Faith fear defeats
[1:19:39] Faith but fear is dead When Faith exists
[1:19:43] you have faith to believe then the fear
[1:19:45] is gone you don't have to worry about it
[1:19:47] because you know what Jesus Christ has
[1:19:49] already done and said and given to you
[1:19:52] he's cleared the way no weapon form can
[1:19:54] Pro Prosper you are the one that is the
[1:19:57] Victor because he has made you more than
[1:20:00] a
[1:20:01] conqueror because he loves us gave his
[1:20:05] life for us I got one more scripture I
[1:20:08] want to
[1:20:09] read Ephesians chapter
[1:20:16] 6 God is with us he never leaves or
[1:20:20] forsakes us amen amen
[1:20:25] Ephesians chapter
[1:20:31] 6 praise the Lord
[1:20:35] Jesus Ephesians 6 let's start with verse
[1:20:38] 10 finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:20:42] Lord can we just close the Bibles and go
[1:20:44] home yeah amen
[1:20:48] dismiss be strong in the
[1:20:51] Lord praise God Amen that doesn't cause
[1:20:54] you to lift physical weights dumbbells
[1:20:57] car Bells nothing wrong with that
[1:20:59] doesn't cause you to do that no being
[1:21:02] strong in the Lord is a
[1:21:05] faith it's a faith based in your heart
[1:21:08] in your soul that rides over every other
[1:21:11] obstacle that Satan May throw in your
[1:21:13] way that the world may it's not fear
[1:21:15] there's no fear in faith
[1:21:18] amen finally my brethren be strong in
[1:21:22] the Lord amen that's a proc
[1:21:25] God help me I want to I I want to
[1:21:27] fulfill that scripture to be strong in
[1:21:30] the Lord and in the power of His might
[1:21:33] so now it's not your might you're not
[1:21:35] fighting against with him on your
[1:21:39] own it's not your muscles it's not your
[1:21:42] intelligence it's not your uh goodness
[1:21:45] Badness it's God God's righteousness
[1:21:49] it's your inheritance that God has G you
[1:21:52] the power of his mind put on now it's
[1:21:55] our part now our part is to put on the
[1:21:58] whole armor of God that you may be able
[1:22:01] to stand against the Ws of the devil put
[1:22:04] on the whole armor of God God give us
[1:22:06] the whole armor that we are to be able
[1:22:08] to take put on resist
[1:22:12] overcome amen amen so many times we lose
[1:22:16] our faith because we don't put on the
[1:22:18] whole armor of God or we feel that we
[1:22:21] fallen short on some part of that armor
[1:22:24] so somehow by not having what we feel
[1:22:29] would be adequate enough armor to put on
[1:22:32] we lose our faith our faith goes away
[1:22:35] because because at that point we start
[1:22:38] basing on ourselves yes the Bible says
[1:22:40] you put on the whole armor of God but we
[1:22:43] still do it in faith trusting God is
[1:22:45] there with us that's right
[1:22:49] amen for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:22:52] and blood but against principal against
[1:22:55] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:22:56] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:22:58] wickedness and high places and we see it
[1:23:02] today greater than ever in my
[1:23:05] opinion wherefore take unto you the
[1:23:08] whole armor of God that ye may be able
[1:23:10] to withstand in the evil day and if

[1:24:47] against you no wonder the scripture says
[1:24:50] this is our inheritance no wonder the
[1:24:51] scripture says that there's no weapon

[1:25:08] strengthen it don't use it as an excuse
[1:25:11] yeah a lot of times today people use a
[1:25:13] weakness they might have as an excuse
[1:25:15] for failure there is no excuse for

[1:26:00] anything he is a weaponless foe although
[1:26:04] he has the weapons he has but it can't
[1:26:07] Prosper so in our eyes we look and if it

[1:27:22] remember a brother one time
[1:27:25] um I don't remember all the details but
[1:27:28] he had a flat tire or something he was
[1:27:29] on the side of the road or he stopped to
[1:27:32] help somebody I can't remember what it
[1:27:33] was and the guy just came over and
[1:27:35] pointed a gun right in his face and
[1:27:36] pulled the trigger gun didn't go off
[1:27:40] wouldn't go off the guy tried it just

[1:27:59] trigger wouldn't couldn't pull it with
[1:28:02] all the strength and might that he could
[1:28:04] muster up he could not pull the trigger
[1:28:06] on that gun he says God I can't even
[1:28:09] kill myself those gun across the room
[1:28:11] and it goes
[1:28:12] off but in his hand wouldn't go
[1:28:15] off amen reaches up to grab a power
[1:28:21] line voltage that would fry any

[1:28:37] against you can prosper right amen God
[1:28:39] is with you praise Lord now not to say
[1:28:44] that happens to everybody but God
[1:28:46] watches after his own Saints and God
[1:28:48] does not allow anything to happen that's
[1:28:50] not according to his will for our lives
[1:28:53] We Trust him all things work together
[1:28:55] for our good because we love him amen
[1:29:00] and it works together for our good like
[1:29:01] we said before there's probably
[1:29:04] thousands of times that God is
[1:29:07] protecting us and watching over us and
[1:29:09] doesn't allow things to happen and we
[1:29:11] don't even know
[1:29:13] about no idea that this happened the way
[1:29:16] it happened because God was keeping
[1:29:18] something from happening to
[1:29:22] me never know it
[1:29:24] and then sometimes the things come up
[1:29:26] like we look at and say you know that
[1:29:29] that could have very may not know for
[1:29:31] sure but could have very well that could
[1:29:32] have been the hand of God yeah I believe

[1:29:38] that's based on your faith some people
[1:29:40] look at that and say oh that's

[1:29:56] quenes God's in control of this God's in
[1:29:58] charge of this and when God is in charge
[1:30:00] and you believe God is there is no
[1:30:02] coincidence amen God's orchestrating the
[1:30:05] whole thing yes amen he may allow may
[1:30:08] not allow but it's up to him what he
