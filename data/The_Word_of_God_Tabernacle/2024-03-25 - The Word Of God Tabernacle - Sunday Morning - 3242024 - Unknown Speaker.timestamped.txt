[25:15] Bible but the only Bible they'll ever
[25:19] see is you a walking epistle written and
[25:23] known of all men you're the Bible form
[25:26] and that should speak to our hearts to

[36:29] I have been very
[36:32] [Music]
[36:35] um there's been people that have really
[36:38] suffered from the covid vaccine and from
[36:41] um and long Co and um and I just kind of
[36:46] let it
[36:48] slide and one of the reasons I let it
[36:51] slide is because I don't have a a
[36:54] doctor's degree behind me I can
[36:58] so I was just kind of discouraged I just
[37:01] kind of
[37:04] stopped
[37:06] people and and my friend Dominic is out
[37:11] there talking to
[37:21] people
[37:23] so in this discouragement all of a
[37:26] sudden um I was I was doing something
[37:29] online and I don't remember what and all
[37:32] of a sudden it just popped
[37:35] up all the research and everything in
[37:38] one place and so and I I just thank God
[37:44] because it was just so Tim and so you
[37:47] know and he's done that all my life and
[37:50] I and I just thank God for that amen

[38:46] praise the Lord amen let's stand to our
[38:49] feet then amen we'll just go to the
[38:50] scripture this should be uh far as I can
[38:53] see now uh as far as the Lord has took
[38:56] it to uh
[38:58] this this study we've been on God in
[39:00] simplicity so we're going over to
[39:02] Matthew chap
[39:04] 11 1 verse verse 25 amen this is God in
[39:08] Simplicity part 16 Bride versus Church
[39:12] part seven amen so Lord willing far as I
[39:16] know now this will be the last part of
[39:17] this as the Lord adds on to something
[39:20] course Easter's next Sunday uh so but as
[39:23] far as I know we'll see whatever the
[39:25] Lord does of course kind of just falls
[39:28] under the umbrella of of a of a specific
[39:31] title I put to it but really almost all
[39:34] the messages have been
[39:37] uh different so uh but whatever the
[39:41] Lord's will that's what we want amen
[39:44] before we read the word can we just bow
[39:45] our heads another word of prayer Lord
[39:47] Jesus we're so very thankful again God
[39:50] your grace your love your mercy the
[39:52] blessings you give the Miracles you
[39:54] perform who you are to us Lord and the
[39:56] truth that we have in our hearts and
[39:58] know God that you are more than faithful
[40:01] Lord because you you've never failed us
[40:03] you cannot fail us it is impossible to
[40:06] fail us Lord and God we ourselves are so
[40:11] thankful to you God we want to let you
[40:13] know how preached we are the testimonies
[40:16] that's been said today Lord and God just
[40:18] know that you are here once again this
[40:21] morning to do the exceeding abundantly
[40:23] above all that we could ever ask or
[40:25] think believing that you're still the
[40:27] same yesterday today and forever Lord we
[40:30] know God that this word will not return
[40:32] void accomplish it in there what you'd
[40:34] have sent it forth for and Lord may your
[40:36] Holy Spirit God brood over this place
[40:39] through and in us God moving in and out
[40:41] the Avenues of our heart Lord fill all
[40:44] this place where we're sitting today God
[40:46] and let it be God as it was on the day
[40:49] of Pentecost in that upper room that you
[40:51] move in a supernatural way to touch each
[40:54] one of us and bring strength and healing
[40:56] and blessing and and touch us oh God we
[40:59] are in need of you now more than ever
[41:03] Lord this world it's when I was younger
[41:07] Lord it just I didn't pay much attention
[41:09] to it but you could tell it was getting
[41:11] worse yes but Lord now it seems like
[41:14] every not almost every day it's almost
[41:16] every hour now that things are just
[41:19] getting worse and worse Lord and I say
[41:21] that based on the fact of your word Lord
[41:24] getting worse based on your word getting
[41:26] further and further from you uh God but
[41:30] Lord help us when all of what's going on
[41:33] around us is getting further away from
[41:35] you Lord help us to continue to draw
[41:38] closer to you lord lord I rebuke every
[41:41] demonic spirit that would try to hurt
[41:43] hinder and filtrate this service in any
[41:45] way or anyone here God may your Holy
[41:49] Spirit come with that Shield God and
[41:51] bring that strength and blessing that
[41:53] you are to us we commit ourselves to you
[41:56] now the remaining part of this service
[41:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[42:00] pray
[42:01] amen Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus
[42:05] answered and said I thank thee oh Father
[42:07] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[42:09] has hid these things from the wise and
[42:11] prudent and has reveal them unto babes
[42:15] you can be seated if you'd
[42:17] like amen I want to continue on the same
[42:20] theme we have last week if you will um
[42:23] speaking about the actually more or less
[42:27] the closeness of of what we know that it
[42:30] would be so close to deceive the very
[42:32] elect yes we l we looked into U uh the
[42:37] life of balum a little bit which will
[42:39] continue on just a little bit here and
[42:41] what happened with the children of
[42:43] Israel recognizing that the same thing
[42:45] that the devil continues to do to try to
[42:48] trip up God's children at every chance
[42:51] he gets found out how balam's teachings
[42:55] uh it was the teachings of balam's that
[42:57] was wrong but there was also inside
[43:00] those teachings that led uh the children
[43:03] of isra Israel astray was also a truth
[43:07] when bam came to him and said we all the
[43:09] same people theoretically he was correct
[43:12] they were all of the same family we
[43:15] looked up the lineage found
[43:17] out the the the idolatry of Moab with
[43:21] Bel peor was in obviously in relation to
[43:26] in the line of Abra abam amen with lot
[43:30] being his nephew and then Moab is lot's
[43:34] son so you can see how close that can be
[43:39] how close many times it is you know
[43:43] Satan came to Jesus one day and tried to
[43:46] deceive Jesus and oddly
[43:50] enough uh we we all know how cunning and
[43:53] clever the devil is but we can also look
[43:56] at the scripture realize how stupid he
[43:59] is too right because why would the devil
[44:02] try to come to the word and try to
[44:06] defeat the word with the word right well
[44:10] he does the same thing to us yes the
[44:12] brides becoming the word and he tries to
[44:15] defeat us the same way he tries to
[44:17] defeat that that he has defeated the
[44:20] church world and that is with the word
[44:23] the sword we read that in one of the
[44:25] beginning parts of this whole series
[44:28] over in chapter 6 we found out he was
[44:30] given the great sword he went forth to
[44:32] kill with that sword and that's exactly
[44:35] what happened it's not a physical sword
[44:37] of a physical killing anymore but it's a
[44:40] spiritual sword they take Satan has
[44:42] taken the word to make it look just like
[44:45] the real but he's interjected man's
[44:48] opinions and man's ideas and dogmas and
[44:52] denominations and churches and and all
[44:54] this has been come up for all these
[44:56] years but he tried to do the exact same
[44:59] thing to Jesus he came to the word Jesus
[45:03] Christ and he said it is
[45:06] written
[45:08] really that's going to be the bullet
[45:11] you're putting in your gun for today it
[45:13] is written you're going to try you're
[45:16] actually going to try to deceive Jesus
[45:18] with the
[45:20] word amen amen but Jesus came back and
[45:24] said it is also written
[45:27] amen the word in its proper place
[45:31] correcting the misplacement of the word
[45:34] by the devil right and he does the exact
[45:36] same thing today a lot of people think
[45:39] well it's okay it's the word but
[45:41] remember brother Adam said you can't
[45:43] mislocate misinterpret misplace so on
[45:45] and so forth the word me because that
[45:48] makes it just as hybrid as anything else
[45:52] right as a man's idea of it or a man's
[45:54] opinion or a man's interpretation of if
[45:57] you take it and misplace it is just as
[45:59] wrong as if
[46:01] you misquoted it
[46:04] completely to put it out of its place
[46:07] makes it not as not effective just like
[46:09] anything else would be amen and that's
[46:12] that's still the same tactics of the
[46:14] devil but that's exactly what we show to
[46:17] saw through balam's teachings he said
[46:20] well he was so wrong but it's just like
[46:22] it was in the Garden of Eden it was so
[46:25] wrong what happened in the garden of
[46:26] beeden but what it was was 99% true
[46:30] right what bam was teaching here
[46:32] fundamentally was true they were
[46:35] family but they but they he took that to
[46:40] misplace it in a place to call us one in
[46:45] into a place of
[46:47] idolatry a a a a spiritual
[46:51] fornication and that God does not
[46:54] tolerate amen because all that does is
[46:57] leads you away from God yes and as the
[47:00] churches uh may be in the in the world
[47:03] grow bigger have more Authority have
[47:06] more money have greater crowds the bride
[47:10] seems to be shrinking a little at a time
[47:12] with every saint that passes away it
[47:14] seems like it just gets smaller and
[47:17] smaller yes make it sure doesn't make
[47:20] you realize that brother bandam said
[47:21] that just if there's one and two some
[47:24] make sure you're that one amen praise
[47:26] the Lord it's going to be just a small
[47:28] group right amen I believe there's going
[47:30] to be more than one so don't get me
[47:31] wrong and like people got him wrong uh
[47:34] but he said if it were to be that way
[47:36] just make sure you are that one praise
[47:39] the Lord that's the main thing about it
[47:41] but that
[47:43] deception and that's exactly what it is
[47:45] that deception I want to I want to
[47:47] continue on the the that
[47:50] thought let's go to 2 Corinthians
[47:53] chapter
[47:55] 6
[47:59] 2 Corinthians chapter 6 just read a few
[48:02] verses of scripture we'll start with the
[48:04] 14th
[48:06] verse 2
[48:08] Corinthians
[48:14] 6:14 it says be ye not unequally yolked
[48:17] together with
[48:20] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[48:24] righteousness with unrighteousness yes
[48:27] and what communion hath light with
[48:30] Darkness yes you know what has
[48:34] zero uh when God created light Darkness
[48:39] dissipated amen because God is light so
[48:42] the greater uh element here is light not
[48:45] Darkness I know it looks in the world
[48:47] like the greatest element is Darkness
[48:49] but it is not the greatest element is
[48:52] light when the light comes the darkness
[48:55] has to go one does not have cannot have
[48:59] Concourse with the other it cannot
[49:02] praise the Lord look now and what
[49:04] Concord had Christ with Bilo now Bilo is
[49:08] just worthless uh uh uh Antichrist
[49:13] another word of the devil if you will
[49:15] Satan what so would you say what what
[49:19] Concord What relation would Christ have
[49:22] with the devil right
[49:25] amen or or what part hath he that
[49:28] believeth with an Infidel or an
[49:32] unbeliever amen you say well what what
[49:34] would you have in
[49:36] common now now this isn't to say that
[49:39] you couldn't have someone that's a
[49:40] friend that doesn't believe this messeng
[49:42] or the way you do I'm not talking about
[49:43] that I'm talking about The Concourse
[49:46] together the relation amen uh an
[49:50] acquaintance or something I I don't know
[49:53] that you could really but see I I I put
[49:57] the category of friend in a whole
[49:59] different category than a lot of people
[50:01] do right uh a lot of a lot of people
[50:04] will say because a somebody clicked on a
[50:06] button on a social media platform that
[50:09] that person's their friend excuse me
[50:11] they are not a
[50:13] friend uh a friend is someone who is uh
[50:17] someone like any other to you that is a
[50:21] bond that is unbreakable that is uh uh
[50:25] thick and thin if you will
[50:27] uh Jesus said Stith closer than a
[50:30] brother amen that's a friend a lot of
[50:32] people say I got friends um you know to
[50:36] me those are
[50:38] acquaintances you might have a lot of
[50:40] acquaintances people that you know
[50:43] people that you might have some time
[50:44] with but this is to me talking about The
[50:47] Concourse of togetherness of
[50:49] relationship of of serious deep
[50:52] relationship amen uh what has what has
[50:56] the the believer to do with the
[50:58] unbeliever in that category can't have
[51:00] it right it just can't be what agreement
[51:05] had the temple of God with Idols amen
[51:09] the temple of God with Idols for ye are
[51:12] the Temple of the Living God as God has
[51:15] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[51:18] them and I will be their God and they
[51:20] shall be my people praise the Lord so
[51:23] what would this Temple what would this
[51:26] Temple have to do with
[51:28] Idols I don't worship any but one that's
[51:31] the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is my God
[51:35] he is my Lord he is my savior he is my
[51:38] everything this Temple has no relation
[51:41] with Idols with with with the other
[51:43] things that would take me away from him
[51:47] amen um I I still have my my manager at
[51:51] work still tries to pull on me to become
[51:53] a manager of a team manager I'm like if
[51:58] I felt like that it would not interfere
[52:00] with what I what we have or do here then
[52:03] uh I might consider it but that's not it
[52:06] this that's that's my secondary job this
[52:09] is my primary amen and now always look
[52:12] at it that way God is always first
[52:15] regardless period always first always
[52:17] going to be first amen amen and that's
[52:20] the way it should be
[52:22] yes amen I will walk with them they
[52:25] shall be my my God uh I will be their
[52:28] God they should be my people amen
[52:30] wherefore come out from among them and
[52:33] be ye separate sayeth the Lord and tou
[52:36] touch not the unclean thing and I will
[52:38] receive you praise the Lord just like we
[52:42] talked about last couple of services
[52:45] with Revelation 18 come out of her my
[52:47] people and be not partaker of her sin

[55:21] would everybody really and make
[55:24] everybody a Believer but can't do that
[55:26] that cuz it's free moral agency amen
[55:29] they they choose to do what they want to
[55:31] do we choose to do what we want we
[55:34] choose to live the way we want to live
[55:36] that's why it's not legalism that's why
[55:39] the way we live and how we act and what
[55:41] we do and conduct ourselves is not
[55:43] legalism because we choose to do that we
[55:46] want to do it legalism forces you into
[55:49] doing something that uh maybe is against
[55:52] what you want to do well I'll just do it
[55:54] to conform no we don't conform
[55:56] we transform yes amen we become new
[55:59] creatures in Christ Jesus and then by
[56:02] our own free will we live the way we
[56:04] want to live simply because that's what
[56:06] we want to do right amen amen praise the
[56:10] lord it's like I think I told y'all um
[56:14] uh one time with our with our group we
[56:17] had a a what they call team building
[56:19] activity and uh we bowled a little bit
[56:22] and we played a couple arcade games and
[56:24] we went in and and was throwing these
[56:27] axe I'd never done that before uh throw
[56:30] axes at Targets I guess I'm sure we have
[56:32] that here in town somewhere uh throwing
[56:36] actually a literal axe at a at a at a
[56:38] wooden board and you know uh I was I was
[56:42] hitting the bullseye and one of the one
[56:45] of the guys come around said man is
[56:46] there nothing newon can't do and the
[56:48] other guy said yeah he can't cuss I said
[56:50] yeah I can I just choose not to
[56:53] right I don't want to not in my DNA
[56:57] could I do it sure I could I don't want
[57:00] to amen I live this way because I want
[57:03] to live this way not CU I'm forced to
[57:06] not because I think the fer Finger of
[57:08] God is going to command me to hell if I
[57:09] say a cuss word no that's nothing to do
[57:12] with that amen I don't do it out of fear
[57:15] I do it out of love yes amen live the
[57:18] way I live because I love him and that's
[57:21] it but God's word now God's word calls
[57:24] for total separation from all unbelief
[57:27] total separation be not partaker of that
[57:31] sin amen that's why that we are to
[57:34] search the scriptures for in them others
[57:39] think they have eternal life but we
[57:41] search the scripture to make sure look
[57:44] now I I believe the prophet I believe
[57:48] that message I haven't found anything
[57:50] outside of little things that like
[57:52] brother one time he said this 1964 and
[57:55] was 1965
[57:57] I mean silly stuff like that I haven't
[57:59] found anything in that message that I've
[58:00] disagreed with according to the
[58:02] scripture not according to my opinion
[58:04] but according to the scripture I haven't
[58:06] found anything that I've disagreed with
[58:08] or saw that was wrong yes amen I have
[58:11] not but we still search the scripture to
[58:16] make sure cuz it's not brother bram's
[58:19] Soul that's on the line it's yours yes
[58:22] it's mine you do that same thing for in
[58:26] in when you come here with me you search
[58:29] the scripture amen I'm going to have you
[58:32] when you go home today read a read a
[58:34] chapter today or this week sometime amen
[58:38] of something that we're going to talk
[58:39] about but I want you to go home and read
[58:41] I'm not going to read the whole chapter
[58:42] here but I want you go home and read it
[58:45] it's probably a little inappropriate for
[58:48] younger children anyway but uh Gman Reed
[58:51] because it tells about the wickedness I
[58:53] mean really the depth of the wicked of
[58:56] where Israel had gotten to yes amen now
[59:00] but that unbelief we are to be separated
[59:03] from all unbelief yes amen come out from
[59:07] among her and what is that again come
[59:10] out from that teaching come out from
[59:13] that Doctrine come out from that Dogma
[59:16] amen it's not talking about being a a
[59:19] buddy with somebody that you go play
[59:20] golf with or go shooting with or or
[59:23] something like that has nothing to do
[59:25] with that amen but don't be partaker of
[59:28] that of that unbelief of that spiritual
[59:30] it's a spiritual warfare I've said this
[59:33] over and over friends but I want to make
[59:35] sure you get it down it's not the
[59:37] physical it's the spiritual warfare
[59:39] we're talking about amen it's that
[59:42] spiritual adultery that will send you to
[59:44] Hell amen I had found well let's just
[59:48] move on let's go to judges now Judges
[59:50] chapter
[59:55] 2
[59:56] Judges chapter 2 I want to read a couple
[59:59] of scriptures in two and
[1:00:03] three to go back and
[1:00:07] reiterate the thing that got Israel in
[1:00:09] the most trouble with God to the point
[1:00:13] of unforgiveness now remember in the New
[1:00:16] Testament in Hebrews there is a line you
[1:00:20] can cross of an unpardonable sin we do
[1:00:23] know that right amen uh
[1:00:26] people get in themselves messed up with
[1:00:29] that thought of did or didn't but there
[1:00:33] is a way there is a
[1:00:35] place in the in the New Testament in the
[1:00:38] scripture that you can cross that line
[1:00:40] to the UN there is an unpardonable sin
[1:00:44] amen Yes again that unpardonable sin
[1:00:47] doesn't have anything to do with
[1:00:48] physical activities right it does not
[1:00:52] there's no no place in the scripture
[1:00:55] amen that you you say a cuss word and
[1:00:58] you're and you're eternally doomed no uh
[1:01:03] not we don't we don't talk like that and
[1:01:05] we know we don't amen but it doesn't
[1:01:10] mean that something slips or whatever
[1:01:12] that you're just eternally doomed no no
[1:01:14] it's not that's not an unpardonable sin
[1:01:17] yes amen but there is an unpardonable
[1:01:20] sin that's a whole another subject but
[1:01:23] with Israel they crossed that line right
[1:01:27] of unpardonable sin what was it with
[1:01:30] Israel we're going to show once again
[1:01:32] spiritual adultery yes amen spiritual
[1:01:37] adultery while we're at it why don't I
[1:01:39] give you of course I may have already
[1:01:40] done this with you before but I'll give
[1:01:42] you another homework assignment go home
[1:01:44] and Listen to Invisible Union amen it'll
[1:01:47] tie right into to this that brother
[1:01:48] Brand's talking about putting that devil
[1:01:51] your first he called the devil your
[1:01:53] first husband you know that yeah
[1:01:56] don't go listen to it he called it he
[1:01:59] called him your first husband and that
[1:02:02] that marriage has to be completely
[1:02:05] nullified yes and done away with and
[1:02:08] destroyed and put into the sear
[1:02:11] forgetfulness praise God Amen can't hang
[1:02:14] on to the devil a little bit and try to
[1:02:17] and try to marry to Jesus Christ it
[1:02:19] doesn't work that way oh I'm a Christian
[1:02:22] but you know I like amen look now this
[1:02:26] is the thing that God separated himself
[1:02:28] from Israel about thank God He sent
[1:02:31] Jesus Christ or they would have none of
[1:02:33] them been saved or uh been able to make
[1:02:36] it thank God that the blood of Jesus
[1:02:38] Christ not only cleansed us from our sin
[1:02:40] but it reached all the way back as far
[1:02:42] as Adam and as far out as the last human
[1:02:45] that'll ever live it'll cover a wide
[1:02:48] span sa amen because there won't be one
[1:02:51] person that would not have the ability
[1:02:53] opportunity to that precious blood but
[1:02:55] Judges chapter 2
[1:02:58] ver8 and Joshua the son of nun the
[1:03:01] servant of the Lord died being 110 years
[1:03:04] old they buried him in the border of his
[1:03:06] inheritance in h Timnath heris in the
[1:03:10] Mount of Ephraim on the north side of
[1:03:13] the Hill gash and also all that
[1:03:17] generation were gathered unto their
[1:03:19] fathers and there arose another
[1:03:21] generation after them which knew not the
[1:03:24] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[1:03:27] for Israel now there becomes the thing
[1:03:30] that that's the responsibility of us as
[1:03:32] we sit here as Grandparents maybe even
[1:03:34] great grandparents uh grandparents as
[1:03:37] parents we make sure we make sure as God
[1:03:42] Almighty has given us what we need and
[1:03:44] what he has revealed to us and through
[1:03:47] this word and through the new birth that
[1:03:49] we share that with our children we don't
[1:03:51] just share it with them and pardon this
[1:03:54] phrase but I'm going to say it this way
[1:03:56] we indoctrinate them with what we know
[1:03:59] is the truth of the word amen schools
[1:04:02] try to indoctrinate them uh the
[1:04:05] government tries to indoctrinate them in
[1:04:06] fact they're trying to steal them away
[1:04:08] from the parents today but we are to we
[1:04:11] the we are the ones responsible for our
[1:04:14] children amen we are the ones to teach
[1:04:16] them to show them to help them
[1:04:19] understand this is the right way this is
[1:04:21] the truth this is how we live this is
[1:04:24] why we live we have had so many times uh
[1:04:27] taba especially being a girl uh why she
[1:04:31] had long hair why she wear dresses and
[1:04:34] this and that and the other and they
[1:04:35] always ask and and they always expected
[1:04:38] the answer oh it's my religion I said
[1:04:40] don't you dare ever tell anybody it's
[1:04:42] your religion it's not your religion you
[1:04:45] do it because the Bible asks us to do it
[1:04:48] and we want to live the way the Bible
[1:04:50] ask us to live what God asks that's what
[1:04:53] we want to do amen don't ever say It's
[1:04:56] My Religion it's not a religion I had
[1:04:59] the conversation with the guys telling
[1:05:00] you talking about quitting smoking now I
[1:05:03] had the conversation with him he said oh
[1:05:05] I'm not a really religious guy I said
[1:05:07] I'm not
[1:05:08] either I hope there's not a religious
[1:05:11] bone in my body I don't want one
[1:05:12] religious cell molecule in my body I
[1:05:16] don't want anything to do with religion
[1:05:18] yes I want Jesus Christ amen people use
[1:05:22] religion as a covering oh I go to so and
[1:05:25] so's Church
[1:05:26] I I do this so I'm going to make it I'm
[1:05:28] this I I my my family for six
[1:05:31] Generations has belong to this Baptist
[1:05:33] Church and I if they went it was good
[1:05:35] enough for them I'm going that's just
[1:05:36] religion yeah that's just a covering
[1:05:39] that's just something to try to make
[1:05:40] excuse for you being able to smoke drink
[1:05:43] Gamble and live some ungodly life and
[1:05:46] think you're going to go to heaven
[1:05:47] doesn't work that way right amen doesn't
[1:05:50] work that way oh praise the
[1:05:53] Lord all generations ations that were
[1:05:57] gathered unto their fathers and there
[1:05:58] arose another generation after them
[1:06:01] which knew not the Lord we teach that
[1:06:03] generation if there's another generation
[1:06:06] God have mercy if there's another
[1:06:07] generation that comes up after this one
[1:06:10] you teach them right if my grandson has
[1:06:13] children my granddaughter has children
[1:06:15] they teach their children what their
[1:06:16] parents taught them and what we taught
[1:06:19] them amen what I was taught praise the
[1:06:23] lord we teach them they teach them each
[1:06:26] generation so this is not lost that this
[1:06:30] doesn't go away each one remembers amen
[1:06:35] remembers but there was a generation
[1:06:37] that knew not the Lord nor yet The Works
[1:06:39] which he had done for Israel and the
[1:06:40] children of Israel 11th verse now
[1:06:43] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[1:06:45] of the Lord and served Baum and see
[1:06:48] that's just it that's how the little
[1:06:50] things they C they fall off oh I think
[1:06:53] you know well mom and dad taught me but
[1:06:55] I think it's okay so but why did Mom and
[1:06:57] Dad teach you that if it wasn't
[1:07:00] right amen what does the scripture say
[1:07:03] remember always take it back to the word
[1:07:07] don't take somebody's opinion about it
[1:07:08] don't listen to some tape or some book
[1:07:10] or some uh TV show or something and take
[1:07:13] their opinion for it especially if they
[1:07:15] don't believe the truth of the word for
[1:07:16] this hour especially if there's some
[1:07:18] trinitarian you want to take their word
[1:07:20] for the scripture they don't even know
[1:07:22] that there's only one God they're
[1:07:24] already committing idolatry by saying
[1:07:26] there's three Gods
[1:07:28] right and you want to listen to
[1:07:31] that my anyway I'll I'll move
[1:07:37] on the children did evil in the sight of
[1:07:40] the Lord and they served ba them oh it's
[1:07:43] okay if we do this it' be okay if we
[1:07:45] believed it this way it be okay if we
[1:07:48] served it and oh my come on friends
[1:07:52] that's that's the thing that God looked
[1:07:54] at that he hated
[1:07:56] that's the thing that God looked at that
[1:07:57] he separated himself from them that he
[1:08:00] divorced them that he put them away amen
[1:08:04] and they for 12 verse and they forsook
[1:08:06] the Lord God of their fathers which
[1:08:08] brought them out of the land of Egypt
[1:08:10] and followed other gods of the Gods of
[1:08:14] the people that were round about them
[1:08:17] and bowed themselves unto them and
[1:08:19] provoke the Lord to anger that' be the
[1:08:21] same equivalent of the mark of the beast
[1:08:24] right they rece received it they
[1:08:27] received it so much that they went up to
[1:08:29] this Idol or whatever it was and bow
[1:08:31] down to it yeah and
[1:08:34] worship they received it so much to
[1:08:37] themselves they were willing to
[1:08:38] prostrate themselves before it you know
[1:08:41] brother Randon went to see the pope one
[1:08:43] day he said we got to do this cut the
[1:08:46] cff out your pants all this pump and
[1:08:47] Circumstance stuff to be able to go into
[1:08:49] to see the pope he said now make sure
[1:08:51] now you got everything prepared you're
[1:08:53] ready okay make sure now when you go
[1:08:55] into to his imminence that you bow down
[1:08:58] to him and kiss his ring he said no
[1:09:00] that's
[1:09:02] out he that that man will not get the
[1:09:06] pleasure of my
[1:09:08] presence brother B didn't say that but
[1:09:11] that's what I'm saying that Pope will
[1:09:13] not get the pleasure of my presence if I
[1:09:16] got a bound
[1:09:17] out I'm not I bound out to no one but
[1:09:20] Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:23] amen Mercy but that's exactly people do
[1:09:26] it by the thousands by the millions by
[1:09:29] the millions bow down to and worship
[1:09:32] these other
[1:09:34] gods they bowed themselves the children
[1:09:37] of God bowed themselves and they
[1:09:39] provoked the Lord to anger and they
[1:09:41] forsook the
[1:09:43] Lord and served Baal and ASO which we
[1:09:47] already know that Baal was a pagan God
[1:09:51] worshiped as a pagan God but astroth was
[1:09:55] was a female version of that Pagan God
[1:09:59] it was a they called a a a goddess amen
[1:10:04] this was a female version
[1:10:08] so I know it's supposed to be woman's
[1:10:10] month in this country but they made sure
[1:10:13] that there was no e uh uh inequality
[1:10:17] here they they bowed down to the male
[1:10:19] God and they bow down to the female god
[1:10:22] equally they make sure you're going to
[1:10:25] worship these Gods Idols
[1:10:29] Stone metal gold whatever they are
[1:10:34] everything that the almighty God created
[1:10:37] they built and made other gods out of
[1:10:39] them but they had a male they had a male
[1:10:42] and a female amen let's go over now to
[1:10:44] Judges chapter 3 continue reading on
[1:10:50] this because this will help us am God's
[1:10:55] merciful god was even merciful then even
[1:10:58] though the blood of Jesus Christ had not
[1:11:00] been shed at that point God was still a
[1:11:02] merciful god god still gave them a
[1:11:05] chance if they were willing to turn from
[1:11:07] their wicked way and receive him back
[1:11:10] again and eradicate the evil God would
[1:11:12] receive them back again yes and it was
[1:11:15] like that until it reached that place of
[1:11:19] complete spiritual adultery amen but now
[1:11:23] Judges chapter 3 verse
[1:11:26] 5 and the children of Israel uh dwelt
[1:11:30] among the Canaanites Hittites amorites
[1:11:33] parasites uh that that sounds kind of
[1:11:36] bad Like A Parasite it probably was uh
[1:11:41] perizzites hites
[1:11:43] jebusites uh and they took their
[1:11:45] daughters to be their wives and gave
[1:11:48] their and gave their daughters to their
[1:11:51] sons and serve their gods oh we're just
[1:11:55] one again going back to that same
[1:11:57] thought process we're just all one we're
[1:11:59] just all mixing together we'll just all
[1:12:01] be the same you know the Catholic Church
[1:12:04] used to uh used to be a church where
[1:12:06] they didn't allow or they would not
[1:12:08] sanction a marriage of a Catholic to a
[1:12:11] non-catholic they were that strict and
[1:12:14] good for them I I don't think that's
[1:12:17] true anymore but it used to be used to
[1:12:20] be they would would not allow women
[1:12:23] preachers uh even though I still think
[1:12:27] there there's some in the organization
[1:12:29] cuz this current pope is like well we're
[1:12:33] not going to sanction them but just like
[1:12:36] gay marriage oh we don't sanction it but
[1:12:40] it's just like the same thing here oh
[1:12:42] well we're not going to sanction that
[1:12:44] but you know they're just people you
[1:12:48] know just just like we are it's okay but
[1:12:51] it used to be that they wouldn't do that
[1:12:53] would absolutely Catholic Church would
[1:12:55] would not sanction if they were not
[1:12:57] Catholic you could not marry them that's
[1:13:00] the way they felt about it now again I
[1:13:03] don't think that's true
[1:13:05] anymore because of the recognition of
[1:13:08] what
[1:13:10] happens amen getting un getting
[1:13:15] unequally like that usually causes one
[1:13:18] to sway over to the other and
[1:13:21] usually the the the one that sways over
[1:13:24] to the other is probably the one that's
[1:13:26] the least sticky to the flesh it's the
[1:13:29] path of least resistance which we all as
[1:13:32] humans seem to enjoy the path of least
[1:13:34] resistance we like to go the easier path
[1:13:37] if at all possible so to make it right
[1:13:40] and to make it easy we just conform over
[1:13:43] to the wicked way of the one that wasn't
[1:13:46] Godly right don't be unequally Yol amen
[1:13:50] that's why it says that yes it's the
[1:13:52] same thing they did it here in Israel
[1:13:55] the same thing took their daughters to
[1:13:56] be their wives gave their daughters to
[1:13:58] their sons and they served their gods
[1:14:00] they didn't serve the god they sered
[1:14:03] their God right and the children of
[1:14:06] Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:14:08] and
[1:14:09] forgot the Lord their God and served
[1:14:12] balum and the Groves and the Groves now
[1:14:15] they got all these trees and these uh
[1:14:20] things that they set up as for for uh
[1:14:23] worship of all of of foreign gods and
[1:14:27] idolatry and and and spiritual adultery
[1:14:31] they got they they've got these Groves
[1:14:33] that set up as as high places as as
[1:14:36] worship to these people as worship to
[1:14:39] these gods and they worship balum amen
[1:14:42] worship balam worship His ideas and they
[1:14:46] served balum and and and sered these
[1:14:49] gods in these high places that they set
[1:14:51] up as places of worship to these to
[1:14:54] these
[1:14:55] gods they called them oh and they and
[1:15:00] the children of Israel served them they
[1:15:03] married into these families and said oh
[1:15:05] okay well we'll just go and do this then
[1:15:08] oh this seems easier than this oh the
[1:15:11] the my family they had all these rules
[1:15:14] and regulations and they had all these
[1:15:16] things we had to follow and all these
[1:15:18] things we had to do and all these holy
[1:15:21] days and new moons we had all these
[1:15:23] things he had dud this is so much easier
[1:15:26] why would why would we choose to do all
[1:15:28] of those uh regulations and things and
[1:15:32] we can just do this it's so much easier
[1:15:36] and the same thought is today people
[1:15:39] always want to take the path of least
[1:15:41] resistance amen and a lot of people do
[1:15:44] but it's not what God does it's who he
[1:15:47] is it's what we believe who he is amen
[1:15:52] because who he is manifest that's what
[1:15:55] he
[1:15:56] does praise the Lord and they serve now
[1:16:00] the children of Israel serve God and the
[1:16:03] gr you say now why why did God just not
[1:16:07] take bam out of the picture bam you're
[1:16:10] not doing when I told you bam you're not
[1:16:12] prophesying your prophecies are right
[1:16:14] but you're teaching you're you're
[1:16:16] teaching the children of uh the teaching
[1:16:18] the children of Israel into idolatry and
[1:16:21] just take B them off the Earth why
[1:16:23] because they had a choice
[1:16:25] right God wants us to choose him of our
[1:16:28] own free will yes God doesn't want there
[1:16:33] not to be another choice you understand
[1:16:38] that God wants there to be another
[1:16:41] Choice God wants that to be like that so
[1:16:44] we choose him over that yes amen that we
[1:16:49] choose the truth that we choose the
[1:16:51] message that we choose the correctness
[1:16:54] of the word over the idolatry yes over
[1:16:57] the falseness over the man-made ideas
[1:16:59] over the
[1:17:01] dogmas they exist because of the
[1:17:03] contradiction between the two but God
[1:17:07] wants us to serve him of our own free
[1:17:09] will not because we're forced to do it
[1:17:12] right if there's only one choice then
[1:17:14] there's no choice yeah amen just like
[1:17:18] people say well I'm not going to choose
[1:17:20] well that's a
[1:17:21] choice when you say I'm not going to
[1:17:23] choose you're making a choice yes
[1:17:27] because we're free moral agents yes it's
[1:17:30] inherent in us it's what God is how God
[1:17:33] made us and God wants us to so God
[1:17:36] wasn't going to wipe balam
[1:17:38] away because Israel had a choice you can
[1:17:41] go with bam or you can serve me
[1:17:45] amen remember what Joshua said too as as
[1:17:48] a as for me in my house we will serve
[1:17:51] the Lord praise God Amen
[1:17:55] now bam and the gr therefore the angle
[1:17:58] of the Lord was hot against Israel and
[1:18:01] the and he sold them into the hand of
[1:18:05] kusan
[1:18:06] ram king of
[1:18:09] Mesopotamia and the children of Israel
[1:18:12] served kushan
[1:18:14] R uh
[1:18:16] RAM eight years eight years and when the
[1:18:20] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:18:22] the Lord raised up a deliverer now you
[1:18:25] got you got people that are crying out
[1:18:28] because there's all there's there's that
[1:18:30] group that's there that cries out to God
[1:18:34] and seeing this think about Jeremiah
[1:18:37] m i i I've got to admit I am glad God
[1:18:41] did make me
[1:18:42] Jeremiah now Jeremiah obviously had
[1:18:45] God's anointing on him to do what he did
[1:18:47] but could you imagine being
[1:18:50] Jeremiah I imagine every time Jeremiah
[1:18:53] came in some in the people people's
[1:18:55] company say oh my goodness here he comes
[1:18:57] again what evil is he got to say for us
[1:19:00] today can that man not think of one
[1:19:03] thing positive to tell us today well he
[1:19:07] would if you would do something good yes
[1:19:10] he's only doing that by God's
[1:19:12] instruction because your lives are so
[1:19:14] wicked and evil yeah if you quit being
[1:19:18] wicked and evil maybe he could have
[1:19:20] something good to say yeah but for his
[1:19:23] whole life basically poor Jeremiah the
[1:19:26] weeping prophet day after day after day
[1:19:30] after day because he was trying to get
[1:19:33] them God's mercy trying to get them back
[1:19:36] where they're supposed to be back right
[1:19:39] with him and see now there's these
[1:19:40] people that see the sin and they're
[1:19:42] crying out to God and God delivers them
[1:19:46] and then here comes another group they
[1:19:47] go right back out and then they cry out
[1:19:49] to God again and over and over became
[1:19:52] kind of a circle perpetual thing the
[1:19:55] thing here now
[1:19:57] is that the exclamation we'll get to it
[1:20:00] in a minute was to remember the teaching
[1:20:03] of balum remember the ways of balum not
[1:20:07] to follow them right because we know by
[1:20:10] the scripture that balam's way is the
[1:20:13] wrong way now
[1:20:15] look going kind of along with this theme
[1:20:18] brother brandom says in the Christan
[1:20:19] mystery of God revealed now noticing and
[1:20:23] bringing that back in letting that man
[1:20:25] do that and knowing what he would do
[1:20:28] know he would do it but what did it do
[1:20:30] it displayed
[1:20:32] Jesus's attribute as a
[1:20:35] savior he allowed humans to do to go the
[1:20:39] way they went yes the Savior came yes
[1:20:44] what kind of an attribute of Savior
[1:20:46] would have been displayed if nobody was
[1:20:48] lost right again if there's only one
[1:20:52] choice there's no choice
[1:20:55] if there's only one way there's there's
[1:20:57] no way it just is right if if there's
[1:21:02] nobody lost what's the point of needing
[1:21:05] to be saved right amen so that's why he
[1:21:09] said that's why he displayed Jesus the
[1:21:12] ATT one of the attributes of Jesus as
[1:21:15] Savior amen and the whole purpose then
[1:21:19] is left in Jesus Christ God himself to
[1:21:23] take the penalty of his own law death to
[1:21:27] die to redeem the wife that was lost by
[1:21:30] rejecting him to redeem the wife that
[1:21:34] was lost or put away for rejecting him
[1:21:38] right praise God he came
[1:21:41] himself yes to shed his blood to
[1:21:45] annihilate that sin to bring them into
[1:21:47] the fold that's why God said I could
[1:21:50] never forgive never forget Israel
[1:21:53] they're his children they're his people
[1:21:55] always been his servants always been
[1:21:57] always will be amen look
[1:22:00] now they were lost by rejecting him now
[1:22:03] when Eve when Eve went away from the
[1:22:06] word she went away from her mate and
[1:22:10] when the church goes away from the word
[1:22:12] the church goes away from the word to a
[1:22:16] denomination she rejects and commits
[1:22:19] fornications with the world of man's
[1:22:22] Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's
[1:22:26] word amen amen and he says now does that
[1:22:30] sound
[1:22:30] clear he said that does that sound clear
[1:22:35] when she went away from the word she
[1:22:37] went away from her mate when the church
[1:22:39] goes away from the word to a
[1:22:42] denomination she's rejecting her mate
[1:22:45] and committing
[1:22:46] fornication with the uh by reject with
[1:22:49] man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of
[1:22:51] God's
[1:22:52] word does that sound he said the Bible
[1:22:56] said committing spiritual
[1:23:00] fornication any word in the Bible That's
[1:23:04] rejected or if any
[1:23:07] self-interpretation is put to it it is
[1:23:11] absolutely
[1:23:12] rejecting and committing adultery
[1:23:15] against the god that is your husband
[1:23:19] yes that is pretty plain and clear
[1:23:22] Saints God help us yes any
[1:23:26] word any
[1:23:29] interpretation outside of the pure
[1:23:32] unadulterated word of
[1:23:34] God is rejecting and committing adultery
[1:23:37] against God who you claim to be as your
[1:23:40] husband and an and an adulterous never
[1:23:45] enters the kingdom of heaven right we
[1:23:47] know that that's what he done at the
[1:23:50] first place then I say as his Spirit
[1:23:52] calls to you why did walls you
[1:23:55] Hypocrites calling yourself something
[1:23:57] when you take the intellectual
[1:23:59] conception of man and leave the word to
[1:24:01] go to instead of coming pregnated with
[1:24:04] the seed word of God in you you've taken
[1:24:07] every other
[1:24:09] hybrid no wonder she sets Revelation 17
[1:24:14] as a because she's committed
[1:24:16] spiritual
[1:24:17] fornication I know those are strong
[1:24:19] words amen but that's the scriptural
[1:24:22] truth Saints yes we know that's the
[1:24:24] scriptural truth taking every other
[1:24:27] hybrid word no wonder she sets there
[1:24:29] committing spiritual fornication
[1:24:31] teaching the people the things of man
[1:24:34] and not the things of God but he said
[1:24:37] the Bible says fear not little flock yes
[1:24:40] it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:24:42] give you the kingdom hallelujah praise
[1:24:46] the Lord God has given us that truth
[1:24:49] that word now I want to go to
[1:24:51] Hosea uh Hosea chapter 9
[1:24:59] I'll close here in a few
[1:25:02] minutes
[1:25:06] so amen notice
[1:25:11] again children of Israel committed
[1:25:13] fornication not by the prophecy of balam
[1:25:17] but by his
[1:25:18] teachings amen not his prophecies but
[1:25:21] his teachings his teachings is what what
[1:25:24] led them astray his teachings is what
[1:25:27] they obeyed that caused them to commit
[1:25:30] fornication against God's word Hosea 9
[1:25:34] uh verse 7 now as for samariah samariah
[1:25:39] her King is cut off as the foam up upon
[1:25:43] the Water the high place also of aen
[1:25:48] wait a minute I'm in the wrong place
[1:25:50] that's not reading right for
[1:25:51] me uh sorry that was 10 nine Hosea 9 I
[1:25:56] knew that didn't read right look here
[1:25:58] now the days of visitation are come the
[1:26:02] days of recompense are come Israel shall
[1:26:06] know it the prophet is a fool the
[1:26:09] spiritual man is mad for the multitude
[1:26:11] of thine iniquities and the great hatred
[1:26:15] The Watchman of Ephraim which was my God
[1:26:18] but the prophet is a snare of a Fowler
[1:26:20] in all his ways and hatred in the house
[1:26:23] of his is God that
[1:26:27] that's nothing good sad situation Saints
[1:26:32] yeah let's just put it that
[1:26:34] way they have deeply corrupted
[1:26:37] themselves as in the days of
[1:26:39] gibba therefore he will remember their
[1:26:43] iniquity he will visit their sins now
[1:26:46] that's where I want you you want to
[1:26:48] write it down remember read this week if
[1:26:50] you could Judges chapter 19 it tells us
[1:26:55] about what the days of gibo was
[1:26:58] about amen judges 19 I did not want to
[1:27:01] read the whole chapter to us here today
[1:27:03] amen it's very brutal it's very graphic
[1:27:07] it kind of goes in some parts back even
[1:27:10] to when uh the angels went down to Sodom
[1:27:13] to deliver lot and his family out and
[1:27:15] the guy the men came and how they did uh
[1:27:20] it's along those lines but even
[1:27:22] worse uh very
[1:27:24] very I consider very gruesome the days
[1:27:28] of Gideon but it was the point that was
[1:27:31] being made the evil the wickedness that
[1:27:34] had entered into Israel man if that and
[1:27:37] if it was like that then with them what
[1:27:39] do you think it is with this that we
[1:27:41] call ourselves a Christian Nation right
[1:27:43] and where we've gone and what we've
[1:27:45] gotten to amen uh it it it's a disgrace
[1:27:50] it's
[1:27:53] absolutely forgive me is a disgusting
[1:27:56] disgrace of what the country has gotten
[1:27:59] to what the common person out has has
[1:28:03] considered to be acceptable and
[1:28:07] okay it is a is a sad I saw yesterday a
[1:28:11] report about a about an 18-year-old kid
[1:28:15] a boy who considered himself a girl and
[1:28:19] he goes and he murders a 12-year-old
[1:28:22] girl killed her he's been I think he got
[1:28:25] sentenced I'm I'm not sure but I just
[1:28:27] saw the headline
[1:28:30] uh and and even the headline call him
[1:28:35] her I mean I don't then they I I'm not a
[1:28:40] pronoun guy I'm not politically correct
[1:28:42] you all know that they may put me in
[1:28:44] jail for that one day I don't know I
[1:28:45] don't care but because God is still my
[1:28:48] God either way
[1:28:51] but but it's just sad to what it's what
[1:28:54] what the what this world what this
[1:28:55] country's come to and I think this is
[1:28:57] probably one of the better ones still
[1:28:58] left when I hear about stuff in France
[1:29:02] and and and we have a a a woman that
[1:29:04] comes my wife picks up the airport from
[1:29:07] London and the things that happen and
[1:29:09] acceptable and stuff that's over there
[1:29:11] it's even worse than here right I think
[1:29:14] my how could it be I don't know how it
[1:29:16] could get worse and then the next day I
[1:29:18] pick up the paper or or on my phone W do
[1:29:21] papers anymore and it's worse right go
[1:29:24] to bed how could it get worse wake up
[1:29:26] the next day look at the it's
[1:29:29] worse it's sad but it's the truth and
[1:29:32] you think if God did this here again
[1:29:34] judges 19 what would it be to this what
[1:29:37] what is God going to do to this
[1:29:40] nation that we call we call ourselves we
[1:29:43] have ever since its Inception as a
[1:29:45] Christian Nation it was born as a
[1:29:47] Christian Nation probably a more
[1:29:49] Christian Nation than it is anything
[1:29:52] else but look what we've got through
[1:29:54] Saint my mind help us
[1:29:57] Lord they have deeply let me read this
[1:30:00] ninth verse again they have deeply
[1:30:02] corrupted themselves as in the days of
[1:30:04] giba therefore he will remember their
[1:30:06] iniquity he will visit their
[1:30:11] sins I found Israel like grapes in the
[1:30:16] wilderness a't that
[1:30:18] beautiful I saw their fathers as the
[1:30:21] first strip in the Fig Tree at her her
[1:30:24] first
[1:30:25] time I imagine that was those figs are
[1:30:28] awful sweet good to
[1:30:30] eat amen but they went to but they went
[1:30:34] to B peor and separated themselves unto
[1:30:38] that
[1:30:39] shame and their Abominations were
[1:30:42] according as they what as they
[1:30:46] loved M that's why I said friend I don't
[1:30:50] do this because I have to I don't live
[1:30:51] this way because I have to I I do this
[1:30:54] because I love the Lord amen I do it
[1:30:56] because I believe that's his word I
[1:30:58] believe that's what his command is to me
[1:31:00] and how and how we should conduct
[1:31:02] ourselves in his presence what can we do
[1:31:05] to be pleasing to the Lord amen amen
[1:31:08] that's what we if we're really
[1:31:10] Christians that's what we want to do
[1:31:13] amen out of love not out of fear but out
[1:31:16] of love praise the Lord they did this
[1:31:19] because it was what they loved to do
[1:31:22] amen they're that doctrine that teaching
[1:31:26] do not be partaker of her sin I'm G read
[1:31:29] one more scripture Revelation
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:33] two this was such a
[1:31:38] horrible Dogma a horrible
[1:31:43] idolatry that God makes sure and
[1:31:46] mentions it way over in the Book of
[1:31:50] Revelation Revelation chapter 2
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:57] uh verse 14 and
[1:31:59] 15 reading to the pergamus church
[1:32:04] age amen the pergamus church age
[1:32:07] remember it had gone from uh Ephesus to
[1:32:11] sman remember sman was anointed for
[1:32:15] death uh remember uh Ephesus had left
[1:32:19] their first love uh smia was anointed
[1:32:22] for death and now we that pergamus is
[1:32:25] getting darker and darker as each each
[1:32:29] age goes by is getting darker and darker
[1:32:32] until it gets into the pergamus church
[1:32:34] age and now God says this but I have a
[1:32:38] few things against thee because thou
[1:32:41] Hast there them that hold the doctrine
[1:32:44] of
[1:32:45] bam God remembered it all the way in the
[1:32:48] New Testament and that was that was at
[1:32:52] approximately it was a little uh uh uh
[1:32:56] in smia because that was the one
[1:32:58] anointed for death that they started the
[1:33:00] Catholic church that they had the
[1:33:02] meeting in niia Rome in pergamus was a
[1:33:06] reflection of what had happened in uh in
[1:33:11] smia that that nican system had taken
[1:33:14] over and as it moved into the pergan
[1:33:17] church age this was God's uh exhortation
[1:33:21] to the pergan church age
[1:33:24] I have a few things because you have
[1:33:26] them there that hold the doctrine of
[1:33:29] balum Amen exact same thing where did it
[1:33:32] come from the birth of that the birth of
[1:33:36] that church the separation of what bride
[1:33:39] was to
[1:33:41] church those that that accepted and
[1:33:45] believed and took on the doctrine that
[1:33:48] was of niia Roma that started the
[1:33:51] Catholic Church Catholics Catholic
[1:33:54] Church says Peter was their first pope
[1:33:56] well if that's the truth then I'm a
[1:33:57] Catholic because I believe everything
[1:33:59] Peter said in fact if Peter was their
[1:34:02] first pope they should be baptizing in
[1:34:04] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:06] because that's exactly what their first
[1:34:07] pope did amen but they don't do it amen
[1:34:12] claim what they want but it didn't start
[1:34:14] here till 320 ad and in the pergant
[1:34:17] church age God remembers so far back to
[1:34:20] balam to bring them back that
[1:34:22] remembrance the the doctors the thing
[1:34:25] that I have against you is there are
[1:34:27] those there that hold the doctrine of
[1:34:29] phum the doctrine of balum not the
[1:34:33] prophecy the doctrine of balum who
[1:34:36] taught baac to cast a stumbling block
[1:34:39] before the children of Israel to eat
[1:34:41] things sacrificed unto idols and commit
[1:34:45] fornication so so hast thou now also
[1:34:49] them that hold the doctrine of the
[1:34:51] nicians which thing I hate notice right
[1:34:56] there are not very many things in the
[1:34:58] scripture you go back and look there are
[1:35:00] not very many things in the scripture I
[1:35:02] won't call exactly because uh I I've
[1:35:06] read it through obviously but to look
[1:35:08] exactly every single time that God said
[1:35:11] he hated something is
[1:35:13] extremely
[1:35:15] limited but this is one of the things
[1:35:18] that I think God says two or three times
[1:35:20] here that he hates actually hates hat
[1:35:24] the doctrine of the
[1:35:26] nicians hates it
[1:35:29] amen we don't belong to man we belong to
[1:35:33] God right praise the Lord every one of
[1:35:37] us we belong to God the bride's
[1:35:41] relationship with Jesus
[1:35:43] Christ with God is by the word yes our
[1:35:47] relationship is through the word yes we
[1:35:49] are led by the spirit amen the spirit
[1:35:52] leads us to the word the word is Christ
[1:35:55] we are one with him yes let me read this
[1:35:57] one more quote I'll close
[1:36:04] here that gets pretty strong at the end
[1:36:06] I think we know we I don't think it's
[1:36:08] going to be anything we don't know but
[1:36:10] trying to do God a service without it
[1:36:12] being his will this was November 65 so
[1:36:15] this was just weeks before brother Brown
[1:36:17] passed
[1:36:19] away now when I speak to
[1:36:22] denominations I'm not meaning for you to
[1:36:24] be so cruel now I don't mean for you not
[1:36:28] to go to your church now see brother
[1:36:29] random is trying to tell these people
[1:36:31] see he's in life he's at Life Tabernacle
[1:36:34] jackm Church he's not at Bram Tabernacle
[1:36:37] it's another man's pull Pit Brother Ram
[1:36:39] was very respectful very respectful of
[1:36:41] another man's pull pit yeah as well he
[1:36:43] should be I've always tried to myself uh
[1:36:46] to be respectful not teach Doctrine he
[1:36:49] of course this this Thanksgiving
[1:36:52] meetings he had he preached a lot of
[1:36:55] Doctrine because invisible Union
[1:36:57] actually is a part of this uh this
[1:36:59] series as well that at Thanksgiving
[1:37:02] meetings at jackm church in threport was
[1:37:05] the that that message came out of that
[1:37:08] group as well this is trying to do God's
[1:37:11] service without being his will is still
[1:37:12] the same so he's trying to tell these
[1:37:14] people look it's and we've heard him say
[1:37:18] it so many times it's not the
[1:37:21] people there's good people every
[1:37:23] everywhere friend there's there's
[1:37:26] incredibly good Catholics Baptists
[1:37:29] methodists
[1:37:30] Pentecostal charismatics there's good
[1:37:33] people everywhere Saints I I told you
[1:37:36] before I we've had groups of Baptists in
[1:37:38] North Carolina that baptized in the name
[1:37:40] of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ there's good people everywhere
[1:37:45] it's not that it's the system right it's
[1:37:48] this system that Revelation 17 was
[1:37:50] against it's the system that Revelation
[1:37:54] 18 is crying as the voice of God as
[1:37:57] brother R said come out of her it's that
[1:38:00] system am come out 2 Corinthians 6 we
[1:38:03] read today come out of her don't be
[1:38:05] unequally yolked it's that system amen
[1:38:09] not an individual person but the system
[1:38:12] it's like we said the Beast a lot of
[1:38:14] people say the an that the Antichrist is
[1:38:17] the pope that's the office the Beast
[1:38:20] it's the office it's the spirit amen
[1:38:23] people humans get caught up in that but
[1:38:27] it's a system a system is ran organized
[1:38:31] orchestrated ran by the devil every bit
[1:38:34] of it and you see why that's why brother
[1:38:37] Bram says what he's getting ready to say
[1:38:39] when I finish this quote he said now go
[1:38:41] to your church what you're supposed to
[1:38:44] do just don't join up with them
[1:38:48] organizations because one day and I'm
[1:38:51] telling you to prove it by the scripture
[1:38:54] that those organizations that
[1:38:56] denomination we are an organization but
[1:38:59] denomination is the mark of the
[1:39:03] beast amen come out that's why it says
[1:39:09] come out do not be partakers of that sin
[1:39:13] do not be partaker of that organization
[1:39:16] of that denomination he said go to your
[1:39:18] church but don't you join up with them
[1:39:21] amen I've told you many times my family
[1:39:24] we were dying the wool Baptist

[1:39:43] Mayflower so generation to generation to
[1:39:47] generation to
[1:39:49] generation

[1:39:54] denomination and there's tons and tons

[1:40:31] never forget that sitting in the back
[1:40:33] seat of the car Chrysler blue Chrysler

[1:40:37] stuff I get guys in my guys that I work
[1:40:40] with say how do you remember all that I
[1:40:41] don't
[1:40:42] know it
[1:40:44] just it just does I don't know coming
[1:40:47] home the back see the car I know my dad
[1:40:50] said I'll be the it's the last time I'm
[1:40:52] going to church next thing I know my
[1:40:54] dad's writing a letter I got it in here
[1:40:56] I got the letter in here where my dad
[1:40:58] said you take our name off of your books
[1:41:01] we never been on the book Ro book of a
[1:41:03] denomination ever again amen because I
[1:41:07] got my name on a r and it was written
[1:41:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:12] that's the only book I want my name on
[1:41:15] Amen and it doesn't say George Newton
[1:41:17] Bennett III I don't know what it says
[1:41:19] but it identifies who I am and that's
[1:41:21] all I care about right right praise the
[1:41:24] Lord we've come out and not be partaker
[1:41:27] of that thing that he that brother Bram
[1:41:30] talked about with the spiritual the
[1:41:32] spiritual
[1:41:34] adultery not to take the doctrine the
[1:41:39] Dogma does does
[1:41:42] everybody do that no does does everybody
[1:41:46] in the message churches preach pure word
[1:41:48] probably not I don't
[1:41:51] know is anybody in the denominations
[1:41:55] preach uh
[1:41:57] Truth uh out of the
[1:42:00] message I've been in a charismatic
[1:42:03] pastor's church study before and he had
[1:42:05] all kind of brother Brown books in
[1:42:07] there amen I've gone and preached for
[1:42:10] them you stand there and preach over
[1:42:13] people that the house I grew up in had
[1:42:15] less paint than some of those
[1:42:17] women I don't mean that I I don't mean
[1:42:20] that's the same it's just
[1:42:21] true hair short the
[1:42:24] M sweatpants whatever you know all all
[1:42:27] the whole thing going back to the man
[1:42:30] stat got a thing full of brother random
[1:42:33] books but the God
[1:42:36] but the point
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:39] is trying to reach these people
[1:42:45] somehow it's not my concern whether this
[1:42:48] man sees the truth as we know it in the
[1:42:51] message or not that's between him and
[1:42:52] God
[1:42:55] but if if someone can preach the gospel
[1:42:57] truth to someone who doesn't know it God
[1:42:59] bless them God help them give them the
[1:43:02] truth to preach that pure and
[1:43:04] adulterated word to the one that has
[1:43:05] gone astray and if you preach to a
[1:43:08] million and only save one You' you've
[1:43:10] gotten a soul where 10 million worlds
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:15] amen but it's the warning that God gives
[1:43:18] us not to be partaker of that sin that
[1:43:22] unbelief that unbelief is is nothing but
[1:43:25] brought from uh
[1:43:29] uh hybrid Church hybrid word somebody's
[1:43:33] made up or some Seminary start to teach
[1:43:36] or and it started at Nia 320 ad and it's
[1:43:42] gone on from there and right at that
[1:43:43] time God warns them I do not you you
[1:43:47] starting out with the Deeds of with the
[1:43:49] teachings of balam and the Deeds of the
[1:43:50] nicians and I hate it I have that
[1:43:53] against you amen that's why God has
[1:43:57] called us and said come out of her my
[1:44:00] people don't be partaker of that yes
[1:44:03] amen we belong to him we don't belong to
