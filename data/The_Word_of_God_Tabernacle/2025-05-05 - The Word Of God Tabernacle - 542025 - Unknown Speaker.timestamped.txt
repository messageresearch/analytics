[15:48] together that your presence will be made
[15:51] known stronger than ever before. Lord,

[16:44] lights of your coming is almost here.
[16:48] Yes, Lord. And Lord, may we yield

[18:15] believers, Father. And we claim victory,
[18:18] Lord, over the enemy. We know he's

[20:43] blessed a more rural community.
[20:47] Yeah. Living
[20:53] there more peaceful.

[21:09] That's great. Praise the Lord. Anyone
[21:13] else? Well, this is Dennis and then
[21:16] Danny and then my wife. Go ahead.
[21:20] I believe the Lord is showing me, maybe
[21:23] some of you as well, that he's in the
[21:26] little things. He's mindful of all that
[21:28] we have need of. I was uh sorting out my
[21:31] my pills and supplements and and I
[21:34] dropped a pill and I got my flashlight
[21:38] and I couldn't find it. So I sat in my
[21:40] chair and I prayed, "Lord, leave me."
[21:42] And I feel I have a dog that's quicker
[21:45] than lightning. Oh yeah. And so uh he
[21:48] wasn't around, thank God, at that time.
[21:51] And I looked down there was
[21:54] wonderful prayers.
[21:57] Amen. Could have killed the dog.
[22:00] whatever it was.
[22:02] Yes. Um there's a new female neighbor
[22:05] that lives upstairs. She moved in. So,
[22:09] she was at the patio and I decided just
[22:12] to go say hi and introduce
[22:15] myself and uh I took her to my apartment
[22:18] to show her how I clean my floors. Then
[22:21] I said, "This is I'm a Christian." She
[22:25] goes, "Oh, I'm spiritual." So I showed
[22:28] her picture of Jesus Christ and as soon
[22:31] as she saw it, she said, "Will you pray
[22:33] for me?" I said, "Sure, I'll pray for
[22:35] you." So,
[22:39] you know, she was taken by the spirit I
[22:44] have in my Amen. I felt good. Wonderful.
[22:47] That's great. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[22:50] Wonderful. Be influenced. Yes. Amen.
[22:54] Well, I just want to thank God for
[22:56] helping me I had a really bad wreck.
[22:58] Wrecked my car. And um the amazing part
[23:02] is it happened so quick. If anybody's
[23:04] ever been a wreck, and I've never been
[23:05] in one that bad. And my car was still
[23:08] grappled when I got out of the way. And
[23:10] um my airbag hit me really hard. And
[23:14] when the police got there, they were
[23:15] checking on me. I thought, I'm fine. But
[23:17] my mouth was bleeding and I didn't even
[23:19] know it. So it had just split the bottom
[23:21] of my lip, but they thought it was my
[23:22] teeth. But they said, "Your teeth
[23:23] loose." I said, "No, I'm fine." So I got
[23:25] some water and rinsed it out and that
[23:26] cut just went away. Amen. They looked at
[23:29] my mouth and said, "Maybe you need
[23:30] stitches." They said, "We don't see
[23:31] anything." So they don't know where the
[23:33] blood came from. So then I got out, my
[23:35] arms were completely red. It looked like
[23:38] the skin had all scraped off. And so
[23:41] they said, "I think we need to call
[23:42] medics." I said, "No, I'm fine. Just
[23:44] give it a minute." They came back and it
[23:46] was completely gone. Amen. And they were
[23:48] like, "What happened?" And they said, "I
[23:49] don't know." I said, "When I hit," I
[23:51] said, "Jesus." And that's all I
[23:53] remember. Amen. and they said, "Whoa,
[23:55] there's something to that." So,
[23:57] everything that could have went wrong
[23:58] didn't. But the other thing that
[24:00] happened was when the airbag puffed,
[24:03] whatever that chemical is, they say it's
[24:05] an explosive, it got up my nose and down
[24:07] my throat. It made me so nauseous. But
[24:10] in that wreck, the water bottle didn't
[24:11] even fall. So, I was able to take it and
[24:14] spit out water and I blew my nose and I
[24:17] was fine. So, I'm thankful all that that
[24:19] was just happening within that split
[24:21] second.
[24:23] police kept going, "Are you okay? Are
[24:25] you okay?" I was like, "I'm fine." I
[24:27] kept telling I'm fine. I said, "We need
[24:29] your paramedics." It'll be okay. Just
[24:32] let me get out. So, I got out, walked
[24:34] around like, "You're better than the
[24:35] lady that was behind you that I hit." I
[24:38] said, "Well, God helps, you know." So,
[24:40] every time I had a chance, I told him
[24:42] that. Amen. And so, then, of course, I
[24:44] had to sight somebody for the accident.
[24:46] Usually, the person and they were more
[24:49] apologetic for giving me the ticket than
[24:50] anything like Sorry to do this, but
[24:53] something has to take blah blah blah.
[24:56] That's okay. Everything's good. You're
[24:58] still
[25:00] okay. But they couldn't believe they
[25:02] said, "Let me see your arms again." So I
[25:03] showed him again and all those spots.
[25:07] I'm just thankful.
[25:10] And the other thing is my husband was in
[25:12] town because I've never been in a wreck.
[25:14] I didn't know what in the world. I
[25:15] called him. I said, "I don't know what
[25:17] to do. What am I supposed to do?" And I
[25:19] already moved the car out of the
[25:20] intersection. Sometimes they say leave
[25:22] it there, but I was on
[25:24] a right there in front of Whole Foods
[25:26] where super
[25:28] busy can't get out and try to do
[25:30] anything and they didn't say anything
[25:32] about so he was home so
[25:35] he
[25:41] was accidentally
[25:50] been in the town. I hardly ever work in
[25:53] town. Y'all know that very seldom. But
[25:55] two weeks in a row now. And and this
[25:58] week there was so little to do around
[26:00] the place that it was no big deal that I
[26:03] left. I told him, I said, "I guess
[26:05] you're hard up for guys, huh?" He said,
[26:07] "Yeah, we're really struggling because
[26:09] it was just it was hard to find anything
[26:11] for the few guys that was there to do."
[26:13] So it was no big deal. But I left and I
[26:16] happened to be in town and uh be you
[26:19] think about that's
[26:22] uh a not good scenario that could play
[26:25] out. But then you look at uh how that
[26:28] was was to play out and realize the hand
[26:31] of God in all of it. Even though it was
[26:34] a wreck and you tear your car up, God
[26:36] was in all of it. So just
[26:39] when you look, you can see God. Amen.
[26:42] You can see him everywhere. Amen. It's
[26:44] just a miracle. I'm Yeah. So very
[26:46] thankful to the Lord for that. Amen.
[26:50] anyone
[26:52] else? Plus, Michael was out of town.
[26:54] Micah usually if I'm out of town,
[26:55] Micah's usually in town and he's was
[26:58] works right there across the street, but
[27:00] he was out of town, too. So, it just uh
[27:03] or wasn't available. Yeah, I wasn't
[27:05] working. So, yeah, he wasn't working.
[27:07] So, it just it just was so perfect.
[27:10] Amen. So, just thankful to the Lord for
[27:13] that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's
[27:16] go over song number 523 then. Amen.
[27:20] We'll sing
[27:21] this. This is the evening time. Amen.
[27:25] Praise the Lord. I believe with all my
[27:27] heart. This is the evening time, saints.
[27:31] Amen. We'll see the chorus
[27:32] [Music]
[27:36] first. This is the evening
[27:41] time. It's later than you think.
[27:47] The Lord is preparing now for her Lord
[27:53] to
[27:56] me. All things are ready
[28:01] now. The bridegroom I
[28:06] hear. He that has an ears to hear. The
[28:11] evening time is here.
[28:16] The God of this evil
[28:20] age has blinded the eyes
[28:25] today of people who walk their own way
[28:30] not according to God's
[28:35] word denying the things he's
[28:39] done of sending his only
[28:44] son, accepting the creeds of men,
[28:49] rejecting the word of
[28:54] God. Yes, this is the heing
[28:59] time. It's later than you
[29:04] think. The bride is preparing now for
[29:10] her Lord to
[29:14] me. All things are ready
[29:18] now. The bridegroom I
[29:24] hear. He that has an ear to hear. The
[29:28] evening time is here.
[29:34] There's darkness throughout this
[29:38] land. This world just can't
[29:42] understand. A prophet has walked this
[29:46] land proclaiming the way to
[29:52] God. If you would be saved
[29:57] today, then follow the word he gave.
[30:03] Leaving the word of God. This is the
[30:08] evening time. Oh yes.
[30:11] Amen. This is the evening
[30:16] time. It's later than you
[30:21] think. The bride is preparing now for
[30:27] her Lord to be.
[30:31] And all things are ready
[30:35] now. The breath through my
[30:40] hear. He that has an ear to hear. The
[30:45] evening time is here
[30:49] time. Yes, this is the evening
[30:54] time. It's later than you think.

[31:13] now. The bridegroom I
[31:18] hear. He that has an ear to hear. The
[31:23] evening time is
[31:27] here. Yes. He that has an ear to hear
[31:32] the evening time is
[31:37] here. Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[31:42] So thankful to the Lord God. We can
[31:45] realize and see by the manifestation of
[31:48] God's spirit, his word that we are
[31:50] living in the evening time. Yes. Amen.
[31:53] Praise the Lord. for this the evening
[31:54] time of uh the world, the evening time
[31:57] of everything that we've known. This is
[32:00] the evening time. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[32:03] Let's stand to our feet if we could.
[32:05] Then we're going to go ahead and change
[32:06] the world of the
[32:11] service. Amen. So thank the Lord
[32:15] revealed his word to us again. Shine his
[32:18] light upon our pathways. Yes. Amen. we
[32:21] could stand on his promises today.
[32:25] Amen. Thank you, Lord. I'm going to go
[32:27] back to Romans chapter
[32:29] 8. Amen. For the third part of the
[32:33] manifested sons of
[32:36] God, adoption part 14, manifested sons
[32:40] of God, part three. Uh it would be a
[32:43] little simpler maybe that wouldn't have
[32:45] to have as many parts, but I try not to
[32:48] keep the services too awful long.
[32:51] around 50 minutes to an hour or
[32:52] something like that unless I feel led
[32:55] differently. But um just under normal
[32:57] conditions, I try to keep it a little
[32:59] bit lower. So to split it up, just takes
[33:02] a little bit more time. So I apologize
[33:04] for that. But uh we just try to get to
[33:07] the things the Lord has given us to try
[33:08] to share with you. So trust it's a
[33:10] blessing to you. Romans chapter 8. Amen.
[33:14] We're in adoption part 14, manifested
[33:17] sons of God part three now. Amen. But
[33:20] before we read, could just we just bow
[33:21] our head just for a little word prayer.
[33:22] Lord Jesus, very thankful again, Lord,
[33:25] of your grace and mercy to us. Your
[33:27] presence in our lives, Lord. Lord, God,
[33:29] how could we ever overstate the
[33:32] importance of your presence in our lives
[33:35] every day? So many of the testimonies
[33:37] that we've heard, Lord, and things
[33:39] that's been done in our lives, Lord, and
[33:41] the things that's gone on, even just
[33:43] this week, Lord, God, you're just so
[33:45] mindful of us, Lord. We love you so
[33:47] much. We know you love us, God. We love
[33:49] you because you love us. We thank you,
[33:52] Lord Jesus, for your blessings, Lord,
[33:54] for being with us and never leaving or
[33:56] forsaking us. Thank you for your word.
[33:58] Thank you for this time of fellowship,
[33:59] Lord. Bless these people now, God. And
[34:02] we just pray that you'd speak through
[34:03] these lips, the word you'd have us to
[34:05] hear, and all of our ears, Lord, to
[34:07] receive what you'd have for us today,
[34:09] knowing it'll not return void, but
[34:10] accomplish in it that that you'd have it
[34:12] to today. We thank you for it now. We
[34:15] pray that you'd help those that weren't
[34:17] able to make it. We just commit the
[34:18] remaining part of this service, this
[34:20] very important remaining part of the
[34:22] service into your hands. In the name of
[34:24] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[34:27] Amen. Amen. Romans chapter 8. Uh let's
[34:31] we'll read one verse and let you be
[34:33] seated. Um verse 19 again. For the
[34:36] earnest expectation of the creature
[34:38] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[34:41] of God. You can be seated if you'd like.
[34:45] Amen. But I don't want to stop there.
[34:47] We're just not to keep you standing, but
[34:49] uh I want to continue on from that verse
[34:51] because the part I want to get to in
[34:54] today is going to involve as much or
[34:57] more of the rest of the verses down to
[34:59] 23 uh than what we did last week or even
[35:02] the week before. So we'll continue on
[35:04] from here if we can. Now Romans chapter
[35:07] 8 verse 19 back again. for the earnest
[35:10] expectation of the creature cre creation
[35:14] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[35:16] sons of God. We've already went back to
[35:17] the creation and talked about that which
[35:20] we will go into more today. Found out as
[35:23] we saw how it fell uh and how God cursed
[35:26] the ground creation not not the man he
[35:30] created. Amen. although he was given uh
[35:34] uh a lesser place because of the fallen
[35:38] nature at that point but he but God
[35:40] cursed the ground. Amen. So uh
[35:43] recognizing that all of creation then
[35:45] would be waiting for that manifestation
[35:47] of the sons of God bringing back to the
[35:49] place that Adam was at the beginning.
[35:52] That's what creation is wanting. great
[35:54] creation. All of God's creation is
[35:57] wanting it to come back to where it was
[35:59] at that place at that time before the
[36:02] fall. Amen. For the creature was made
[36:06] subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
[36:08] reason of him who had subjected the same
[36:11] in hope. Because the creature itself
[36:14] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[36:17] of corruption. So the creation is also
[36:21] in the bondage of corruption.
[36:24] into the glorious liberty, which we'll
[36:26] talk about in a minute, into the
[36:28] glorious liberty of the children of God.
[36:31] For we know that the whole creation
[36:34] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[36:37] until now. And not only they, but
[36:40] ourselves also, which have the first
[36:42] fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves
[36:44] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[36:46] adoption to it, that is to say, the
[36:49] redemption of our bodies. Amen. Amen.
[36:51] Now, I want to go back over to
[36:54] Genesis, try to finish a little bit that
[36:56] we left off from last week, but also uh
[36:59] delve into a little bit more of this
[37:03] creation and recognizing the creation. A
[37:06] lot of times we talk about man and
[37:09] humanity and the bride and uh us going
[37:12] to heaven and us getting to our rightful
[37:14] position and uh getting in in a
[37:16] glorified body and all those things that
[37:19] we talk about the promises of God's word
[37:20] and all that's wonderful and we look
[37:22] forward to that and I'm thanking God for
[37:24] the promise of his word because every
[37:26] promise God bring to pass and he will
[37:28] not fail on that promise. Amen. Uh but
[37:31] it also is an understanding that when we
[37:33] look at the millennium and when we look
[37:35] at beyond this mortal time after God
[37:39] destroys all of sin when God destroys
[37:42] all the degradation everything off of
[37:43] this earth sin even into the atmospheres
[37:46] that after that will be brought back to
[37:48] that place of perfection like it was to
[37:51] be or was in the garden of Eden before
[37:53] the fall to bring back to that place.
[37:56] So, not only us, when you think about
[37:58] that, but all of the creation that we
[38:01] know of is going to come back to that
[38:02] place again. And we don't think about
[38:04] it, I guess, maybe a whole lot because
[38:06] you get so used to living here in this
[38:09] uh uh in this world and going to a zoo
[38:11] and seeing the lions caged up because if
[38:14] the lion wasn't caged up, he would kill
[38:16] you or the animals around him. And
[38:19] seeing other things like that that that
[38:22] keep them under control or or they will
[38:24] kill. But it's it's weird to think that
[38:27] when you get to that place, it won't be
[38:29] like that. There'll be no cages.
[38:31] There'll be no need for cages. Amen.
[38:33] There'll be no need uh for uh the tiger
[38:37] won't have the nature, the desire to
[38:39] come and kill a gazelle uh or to kill
[38:42] you or anything like that. Those things
[38:45] uh won't be it'll be all of creation
[38:47] will be back to its perfection. And how
[38:51] beautiful it is to see. I got a quote
[38:53] here that I wanted to read that I've
[38:55] read before, but uh it's been a while uh
[38:57] that brother Ram talked about even this
[38:59] beautiful Arizona that we that we enjoy.
[39:02] Amen. Brother Ram talks about that he
[39:04] was living in at the time, too. But a
[39:06] lot of times we we just forget that that
[39:08] all of creation, all of God's creation
[39:11] is growing and waiting to get back to
[39:14] that place of perfection. Now, let's go
[39:16] over to Genesis again, chapter
[39:19] one. Amen. And I want to read through
[39:21] this a little bit again. We're not going
[39:23] to read the whole thing again, but uh
[39:25] bits and pieces of it if we can to try
[39:27] to draw our thought here again of of the
[39:30] creation. Amen. And and the importance
[39:33] of this manifested sons of God and the
[39:36] importance that the manifested sons of
[39:38] God are to adoption. Amen. And the
[39:41] correlation of that manifested sons of
[39:44] God getting to that place of adoption.
[39:46] Amen. Now, ninth verse, Genesis 1:9. And
[39:49] God said, "Let the waters under the
[39:52] heaven be gathered together unto one
[39:54] place, and let the dry land appear." And
[39:57] it was so. And God called the dry land
[40:00] earth, and the ga uh and the gathering
[40:02] together of the waters called ye seas.
[40:05] And God saw it, and it that it was
[40:07] good. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[40:10] forth grass." Amen. Let the earth bring
[40:13] forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and
[40:17] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[40:20] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[40:23] earth. And it was so God's botney
[40:26] lifeite that God had created. All of the
[40:28] seed, the things that that we know that
[40:31] grow out of the ground. Amen. Now,
[40:34] everything that God created came from
[40:37] the earth. Everything, even us, we came
[40:40] from the earth. Yes. Amen. animals came
[40:42] from the earth. The grass comes from the
[40:45] earth. But only the botney life actually
[40:49] literally continues to grow from the
[40:51] earth. Amen. Animal life doesn't. Animal
[40:54] life uh reproduce by procreation. Amen.
[40:59] Human life does not grow out of the
[41:01] ground. Uh we reproduce by now we do by
[41:05] procreation. Amen. So botney life was
[41:07] the only life that actually reproduced
[41:11] based on the seed that was in itself
[41:13] falling back into the this earth. Amen.
[41:17] And we know that uh brother Ram talked
[41:19] about the bedding ground of a woman's
[41:21] womb uh receiving seed. And of course so
[41:25] the process is the same but not the
[41:27] literal earth that we stand on like
[41:29] botney life does. And this body of life
[41:32] had its seed within itself upon the
[41:34] earth to bring forth after its kind.
[41:37] Amen. Now 12th verse. Uh and the earth
[41:40] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[41:42] seed after his kind. And the tree
[41:45] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[41:48] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[41:51] good. And the evening and the morning
[41:53] were the third day. Now let's drop down
[41:55] to the 20th
[41:57] verse. 20th verse. mouth. And God said,
[42:00] "Let the waters bring forth abundantly,
[42:03] the moving creature that hath life, the
[42:06] fowl that may fly above the earth in the
[42:09] open firmament of heaven." And God
[42:12] created great whales. Amen. And every
[42:16] living creature that moveth, which the
[42:19] waters brought forth abundantly, the
[42:21] earth, the waters brought forth
[42:23] abundantly. You notice you read through,
[42:25] you see when it it talks about the earth
[42:28] bringing forth abundantly, the waters
[42:30] bringing forth abundantly. Amen. Amen.
[42:33] Uh people talk about creation and um uh
[42:38] and the ability to be and man's becoming
[42:40] so smart they can recreate things and
[42:43] and and delve into the secret of life
[42:46] and uh have what they call cloning and
[42:49] stuff like that. Uh but a cloning has to
[42:52] be done based on something that already
[42:54] exists. Amen. God took this from nothing
[42:59] and made something. All man can do is
[43:02] take what God created and reproduce it
[43:05] the best to the best of their ability if
[43:07] they can like that. But the only way uh
[43:10] that you can have grass is to take is to
[43:13] go to the Home Depot and get a bag of
[43:15] seed and put it in your yard. Where' the
[43:18] seed come from? Seed came from grass.
[43:20] Where' the grass come from? Grass come
[43:22] from God. Again, which was first, the
[43:25] chicken or the egg? The chicken was
[43:28] first because God created and from the
[43:30] earth. From the earth, that's the very
[43:33] important part to understand about the
[43:35] manifested sons of God. From the earth
[43:37] came forth these animals. From the water
[43:40] came forth the whales that God created.
[43:43] God created great whales. every living
[43:45] creature that moved which which the
[43:47] water brought forth abundantly. So God
[43:50] created based on what he had already put
[43:53] here. Amen. He didn't take something
[43:56] else. He took the earth and created that
[43:59] cow. He took the water, created the
[44:01] whale. From the water come the animal.
[44:03] From the earth come the animal. From the
[44:06] from the earth come the botney life. And
[44:09] every wing foul after his kind, the
[44:11] birds. And God saw that it was good.
[44:13] Amen. And God blessed them. God blessed
[44:16] them saying be fruitful and multiply.
[44:19] Now this is something that God did not
[44:21] tell the botney life. God did not go in
[44:25] creation of body life and tell body life
[44:28] to multiply and replenish. He didn't
[44:30] tell the body life that. Right. Amen.
[44:33] Amen. Because body life had the seed in
[44:35] itself that as it grew to maturity, it
[44:39] dropped its seed back in the ground
[44:41] which continued to reproduce over and
[44:43] over again. Amen. But now in the animal
[44:46] life, he told the animal life to
[44:48] multiply uh be fruitful and multiply,
[44:52] fill the waters in the sea and let the
[44:54] foul multiply in the earth. Amen. So the
[44:57] animal has a different commission at
[45:00] that point uh to that degree than the
[45:03] botney life does. And the evening and
[45:06] the morning were the fifth day. And God
[45:08] said, "Let the earth bring forth the
[45:10] living creature after his kind." The
[45:12] earth bring forth, Amen. the earth bring
[45:16] forth the living creature after his
[45:18] kind, cattle and creeping thing, and the
[45:21] beast of the earth after his kind. And
[45:23] it was so. And God made the beast of the
[45:25] earth after his kind, and cattle after
[45:28] their kind, and everything that creepeth
[45:30] upon the earth after his kind. And God
[45:33] saw that it was good. And God said, "Now
[45:36] let us make man in our image, after our
[45:39] likeness, and let them have dominion
[45:42] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[45:44] fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
[45:46] over all the earth, and over every
[45:49] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[45:50] earth." Dominion is rule over. Amen.
[45:53] This is where brother Vanom got the
[45:56] understanding of Adam being an amateur
[45:59] god or a little god or a god of the
[46:01] earth. Adam was the god of the earth
[46:04] because he was given dominion over the
[46:07] earth and everything about it. Amen. Let
[46:10] him have dominion over the fish of the
[46:14] sea, over the fowl of the air, over the
[46:15] cattle, over all the earth, every
[46:17] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[46:19] earth. Amen. He had rule over. He had
[46:22] control over. Amen. So God created man
[46:26] in his own image in the image of God
[46:28] created he him male and female created
[46:31] he them and God blessed them and God
[46:36] said unto them be fruitful and multiply.
[46:38] Now he give the he give human life the
[46:42] same commission as he gave the animal
[46:44] life. Be fruitful and multiply. Amen. Br
[46:49] be fruitful and multiply. But now body
[46:51] life was brought forth with just seed in
[46:54] itself to drop on the earth to bring
[46:57] forth more life. But the animal life was
[47:00] given a a spirit. Amen. That the that
[47:04] the botney life did not have. It was
[47:07] given a spirit. So he said multiply and
[47:10] replenish the earth. But now human life
[47:13] was not was not only given a spirit but
[47:16] a soul. Amen. or a nature that that uh
[47:21] uh that brought forth how that human was
[47:25] to be what kind of uh uh a person human
[47:30] they were supposed to be by the nature
[47:33] of their spirit. Amen. That's why the
[47:35] animal uh uh a an animal can just go out
[47:40] and live any kind of life and have no
[47:42] shame. Right?
[47:44] uh they they can walk around and just
[47:46] scavenge anywhere and do whatever they
[47:49] want and uh procreate in public or
[47:51] whatever they want to do because they
[47:53] have no shame. There's no there there's
[47:55] nothing there to control that animal uh
[47:59] animal nature or animal spirit because
[48:01] they all they have is a spirit. They
[48:03] don't have a soul. The soul is the
[48:05] control tower. The control tower is what
[48:07] runs the morality of a human being.
[48:10] Supposed to run the morality of a human
[48:13] being. See, and at the beginning when
[48:15] when man uh well, we can finish uh going
[48:18] through this. He gave man multiply and
[48:21] replenish. Just go back to the word.
[48:22] I'll get back to my thought. Replenish
[48:24] the earth and subdue it and have
[48:26] dominion over the fish of sea, over the
[48:28] foul of the air, and over every living
[48:29] thing that moveth on the earth. God
[48:30] said, "Behold, I have given you every
[48:33] herb bearing seed which is upon the face
[48:36] of the earth, and every tree in the
[48:38] which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[48:40] seed. To you it shall be for me, and to
[48:44] every beast of the earth, and to every
[48:45] fowl of the air, and to everything that
[48:47] creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
[48:49] is life, I have given every green herb
[48:52] for meat." And it was so. So God made
[48:55] sure that the animal life and the human
[48:58] life was able to sustain life based on
[49:01] botney life. Amen. And it was life that
[49:05] was to bring life. Yes. Amen. Praise the
[49:08] Lord. Uh and God saw everything that he
[49:11] made. Behold, it was very good. And the
[49:13] evening and the morning were the sixth
[49:14] day.
[49:16] And
[49:18] then uh where am I missing? Let's see
[49:20] here.
[49:24] Amen. Now, uh, second chapter, seventh
[49:27] verse. It's my last verse. Now, let's
[49:29] just skip over. And the Lord God formed
[49:32] man of the dust of the ground. Because
[49:34] you remember when God created man, he
[49:36] created him a spirit man. Yes. Amen.
[49:38] Because God was man was just a spirit
[49:40] then because he created him in his
[49:42] likeness which is spirit. God's a
[49:44] spirit, right? So, he created a spirit.
[49:45] Male and female, the the same masculine
[49:48] and feminines were in that spirit. Amen.
[49:51] But now God is forming man. Man man God
[49:55] formed man of the dust of the ground.
[49:57] Just like he brought forth from the the
[49:59] animal he brought forth out of the
[50:02] ground. Out of the dust of the ground.
[50:04] He did the same thing of man. The God
[50:06] formed the man out of the dust of the
[50:08] ground. But now God in the man breathed
[50:12] into his nostrils the breath of life and
[50:16] man became a living soul. Amen. Amen.
[50:20] Again, what set apart apart botney life
[50:24] from animal life was he put a spirit in
[50:26] the animal. Amen. And and had them
[50:30] procreate to multiply and replenish the
[50:32] earth. Now he's separating the man above
[50:35] all after he gave them dominion over
[50:39] obviously. Now he's giving man and
[50:41] breathing God his God's own breath, the
[50:44] logos, God's own breath into the man to
[50:48] make that man a living soul. Amen. Amen.
[50:51] Now the man has a soul. Now the man has
[50:53] a control tower, man. Now the man has a
[50:56] nature to control everything about his
[50:59] spirit and his flesh because the soul is
[51:02] what controls the spirit and the flesh.
[51:05] Amen. It It's supposed to. Anyway, you
[51:08] look around today and you think uh it
[51:10] seems like the other way around. Uh it's
[51:12] supposed to be that the man is supposed
[51:15] to be ruled soul first, spirit second,
[51:17] flesh last. Amen. And it seems like
[51:20] today uh people in humans are flesh
[51:23] first and who cares about the rest,
[51:25] right? Uh it's flesh first soul. I have
[51:30] a
[51:31] soul. They don't seem to have any shame.
[51:34] They don't seem to care that they do
[51:36] things that are immoral and it doesn't
[51:38] bother them. Uh but there is a control
[51:41] tower in there that that clicks that
[51:45] realizes. uh otherwise they wouldn't
[51:47] worry about doing it at night or doing
[51:49] it in where people can't see them or uh
[51:52] something like that. So you know they
[51:54] they must have some kind of shame. Of
[51:56] course they got a soul. Every human born
[52:00] had a soul were 10 million worlds.
[52:03] Everyone every man. Amen. Animal does it
[52:06] breathed in them by God to become a
[52:10] living soul. But we recognize everything
[52:13] all of God's creation. That's why it
[52:15] says all of creation, we just read, even
[52:17] us, it said, who's received the first
[52:20] fruit of the spirit grown within
[52:23] ourselves, waiting for the adoption,
[52:25] waiting for the manifestation of the
[52:27] sons of God, waiting for this to come to
[52:29] pass because everything in the earth was
[52:32] perfect as God spoke it and created it,
[52:35] right? It was perfect. But it all came
[52:38] from the earth. Amen. But now when man
[52:42] lost and fell. When man
[52:45] fell, he lost all that he had, all that
[52:49] he was, all the promise of God, he left,
[52:53] he lost into the hands of
[52:55] Satan. Amen. All of it, he lost it into
[52:59] the hands of Satan. Remember, we know
[53:03] that he was that that the only people on
[53:06] the earth, we said last week, was
[53:07] supposed to be created was supposed to
[53:09] be spoken word just like God did it.
[53:12] Yes. It was all supposed to be just the
[53:15] way God did it in the beginning. And God
[53:17] spoke and formed man and was given in
[53:21] the book of life, the lamb's book of
[53:23] life. Amen. To me, I've not found
[53:26] anywhere where brother Brandham said it.
[53:28] not found anywhere in the scripture that
[53:30] says it. But to me, we we went through
[53:34] the book of life and lamb's book of life
[53:35] a long time ago over at quarterl. Uh but
[53:39] there because there's a difference in
[53:41] the book of life and the lamb's book of
[53:43] life. Amen. One's contained in the other
[53:46] because everyone that's in the book of
[53:48] life, last book of life also got came
[53:51] into the book of life because we were
[53:53] born as human beings, right? And because
[53:56] God holds life so precious, every name,
[53:59] every life is recorded in the book of
[54:02] life. Amen. But would there have been a
[54:05] need of the book of life? Again, I
[54:07] haven't found brother Brandham said
[54:08] this, but uh I'm trying I I hope I'm not
[54:12] venturing without authority, but to me,
[54:14] it seems like what would have been the
[54:16] need of the book of life until after the
[54:19] fall? Because everyone that was to come
[54:21] forth was whose names were in the lamb's
[54:24] book of life. Amen. And that's all that
[54:26] was ever supposed to be here, right? In
[54:28] the perfect condition, in the perfect
[54:30] world. Now, when God's perfect will came
[54:33] forth, there was a lamb's book of life.
[54:35] When God's permissive will came forth,
[54:37] man fell and man began to come forth by
[54:40] procreation. And man and woman could
[54:43] just pro procreate and and another human
[54:45] come forth because that was the law of
[54:47] God. They tapped into the law of God and
[54:50] another human come forth just because a
[54:52] man and a woman could procreate. Then
[54:54] came a book of life because birth began.
[54:58] Yes. It wasn't supposed to be that way.
[55:00] But it began, it started that way when
[55:03] man fell. So then there was a book of
[55:05] life. Amen. Why? Because every person
[55:09] that was born of a woman was born in
[55:12] sin, shaped iniquity, come to world
[55:14] speaking lies. Even Cain and Abel. Even
[55:17] Abel being from the seed of Adam was
[55:21] still come with a fallen
[55:24] nature, born in sin, shaped iniquity,
[55:26] come to the world, speaking lies. Even
[55:28] Abel was, we know about Cain. Cain was
[55:31] of that wicked one. So we know what his
[55:33] nature was about. But that nature was
[55:35] still the same, but it still came into
[55:37] this world. And every human after that
[55:39] then came into a book of life. Not
[55:42] lamb's book of life, but a book of life.
[55:45] Amen. who whose whose every name that's
[55:48] ever born is on that book of life.
[55:50] Right? Amen. Now, only the only the
[55:53] names the lamb's book of life was was
[55:56] God's perfect will to be created as it
[55:59] was spoken just the way he did it out of
[56:01] the dust of the ground. It is time for
[56:03] Newton Bennett to come forth. Boom.
[56:05] There creates out of the dust of the
[56:07] ground and be created just like it was
[56:10] uh in the beginning as God created the
[56:12] way it was supposed to be. Amen.
[56:15] But when man fell, he fell back into
[56:17] that animal nature again. Look what
[56:19] brother Brown said. Questions and
[56:20] answers on Genesis. He said, "And you
[56:22] take the Holy Spirit off of a man, then
[56:27] he's lower than an animal, right? Worse
[56:31] than an animal." Now, how how can a
[56:34] human be worse than an animal? He can do
[56:37] animalistic things to be like an animal,
[56:40] but what makes him worse than an animal?
[56:43] Because the man has a soul, right? He
[56:47] has a control tower. He has a guard. He
[56:51] has something that is supposed to keep
[56:53] him, stop him, uh a a a moral compass
[56:58] that he's supposed to live by. And when
[57:00] he ignores that moral compass and he
[57:03] falls into the human into the anim
[57:05] animalistic nature, it literally makes
[57:08] him worse than the animal because the
[57:11] because he's doing this anim animalistic
[57:13] nature, but the animal doesn't have a
[57:15] soul to control him. But the man does,
[57:18] right? The animal doesn't know any
[57:20] better, but the human does. Right? And
[57:23] if you know better and you still do it,
[57:26] as brother Dennis said in his prayer, to
[57:28] know to do it and not do it is iniquity.
[57:32] Amen. But the the animal can't create
[57:35] can't commit iniquity because it doesn't
[57:38] know any better. It doesn't have a soul.
[57:40] All it has is its animal spirit, nature.
[57:43] That's all it has. That's all it knows
[57:45] to do. And that's how it lives its life.
[57:48] dog, cat, horse, uh monkey, gorilla, uh
[57:53] deer, doesn't matter. That's how they
[57:55] live their life. But the human is
[57:57] supposed to have a moral compass to know
[57:59] what is right and wrong, to know what is
[58:02] good and bad, to know what is the things
[58:05] they should and shouldn't do. Animals
[58:06] don't have that. So when they act like
[58:08] an animal, Yes. and they know better, it
[58:12] makes them worse than an animal. Yes.
[58:14] Because they know better. That's what
[58:16] brother Brandham said. He's lower than
[58:19] the animal. He's worse than the animal,
[58:22] right? Because he acts like the animal,
[58:26] but he should know better because he has
[58:28] a soul, something to control that. Amen.
[58:32] But now when Adam lost that, now
[58:35] remember when Adam lost, he had Adam had
[58:38] everything under his control. I can't
[58:40] remember if I have that quote here or
[58:41] not, but Adam had everything under his
[58:43] control according to the scripture,
[58:46] domain over everything. He could speak,
[58:48] he could name, he could say. Bible says
[58:50] he God brought forth all the animals and
[58:53] whatever Adam named them, that was their
[58:55] name, right? Amen. Whatever it was, and
[58:58] he had dominion over that. If he's
[59:00] sitting there and the and it got a
[59:02] little warm in the day, which I I don't
[59:04] imagine it would have gotten warm there
[59:06] and the perfect condition that the
[59:07] Garden of Eden was, but if he if if Adam
[59:10] was sitting there and he wanted that uh
[59:12] oak tree from over there to come over
[59:14] here next to him, all he had to do is
[59:16] ask. Yes. Or tell it and not even ask.
[59:19] Just say tree, you come said plant over
[59:20] here. Right. and the
[59:23] tree even to the point of the scripture
[59:25] we read last week said you if you had
[59:28] the faith as the grain of a mustard seed
[59:32] you can say to that mountain I always
[59:35] point to Mount Lemon but you say to that
[59:38] mountain be moved amen and it has to
[59:41] move
[59:43] if you have faith the greater luster how
[59:45] be it these things only come by prayer
[59:46] and fasting but see that faith that that
[59:49] that promise
[59:51] is still real today. Yes, Jesus let us
[59:55] know. It didn't go away because of that.
[59:58] It was diminished because human fell.
[1:00:01] And when humans fell, they lost their
[1:00:03] faith, it got degraded. Anyway, uh but
[1:00:07] Jesus come along and reminded us that if
[1:00:10] you have the faith to gra seed, you can
[1:00:13] move that mountain. Well, Adam had that
[1:00:15] in the very beginning before the fall.
[1:00:17] Oh tree, you come move. Come plant right
[1:00:19] here. come over next to me. He could
[1:00:22] tell that the the the tiger, "Come over.
[1:00:25] I'd like to pet you. I' I need a nice
[1:00:27] pillow right now or something. Lay down
[1:00:29] and snuggle up next to him." Whatever it
[1:00:31] was, he could he could do that. He had
[1:00:34] control. He had the book of life in the
[1:00:36] lamb's book of life in his hand. All the
[1:00:38] names that was on it, the the book of
[1:00:40] redemption was in the hands of the man
[1:00:43] that God had created in the beginning
[1:00:44] and put in charge of all of it. He gave
[1:00:46] him the book of redemption. It was his
[1:00:48] to have. There would have been no need.
[1:00:51] You say, "What about Jesus?" Would have
[1:00:52] been no need for Jesus if there had
[1:00:54] never been a fall. Right? So you talk
[1:00:57] about he is the redeemer. He is the
[1:00:59] kinsman. He absolutely is. But it
[1:01:01] wouldn't have been necessary for him to
[1:01:03] have come if it wasn't for the fall. So
[1:01:06] Adam, his original son, Adam's uh the
[1:01:09] first Adam as the Bible calls it, the
[1:01:12] first Adam had that in his control in
[1:01:15] his hands. That book of life. He had
[1:01:17] dominion over all the earth. God said,
[1:01:19] "I give you this earth. It's yours."
[1:01:21] Amen. Botney life, animal life, it's all
[1:01:24] yours. You can have dominion over
[1:01:26] whales, over the birds. It it it's all
[1:01:28] your all your earth. You are the amateur
[1:01:31] God. You are God of the earth. I've put
[1:01:33] it in your full control. But when Adam
[1:01:36] fell, he lost all that. Right? He lost
[1:01:40] all of inheritance because God could not
[1:01:42] trust someone in that condition to be
[1:01:45] able to redeem from that point on. Amen.
[1:01:49] And there was nobody that could until
[1:01:51] the perfect son of God, Jesus Christ,
[1:01:54] came uh and and and through a woman came
[1:01:58] to uh uh squaltch, if you will, the the
[1:02:01] curse that was in the beginning where
[1:02:04] everyone from there came by procreation
[1:02:07] and through a woman, right? Amen. There
[1:02:09] had to be that perfect one come in. But
[1:02:12] Adam was given that control. It was in
[1:02:14] Adam's charge. When Adam fell, he lost
[1:02:17] it all. He lost the book of redemption
[1:02:19] because he couldn't hold it anymore. He
[1:02:21] was he was in a sinful condition. And
[1:02:24] there's no sinful condition can can can
[1:02:27] take that book of life and redeem. Amen.
[1:02:30] The only one that Adam was able to
[1:02:33] redeem, if you will, was his own wife.
[1:02:35] Yes. He went out there to become one of
[1:02:38] her so God wouldn't kill her. Right. But
[1:02:41] other than that, in his fallen
[1:02:43] condition, he could not redeem anybody.
[1:02:45] So he he lost the book of redemption.
[1:02:48] Yeah. Cuz he was no longer in a place to
[1:02:50] redeem. Amen. So but but the the book
[1:02:54] couldn't go in the filthy hands of Satan
[1:02:57] who he lost it to. So this book went
[1:02:59] back into the hands of God. Right? And
[1:03:02] we find this book over in Revelation
[1:03:04] chapter 5 where he's holding the book,
[1:03:07] sitting on the throne, holding the book,
[1:03:09] and the book is
[1:03:10] closed because nobody was worthy to come
[1:03:14] and open the book of redemption to bring
[1:03:17] forth those names. Those those names are
[1:03:20] on the lamb's book of life. Again,
[1:03:22] nobody could do it. That's why John
[1:03:24] wept. Nobody was found worthy. John
[1:03:27] himself not worthy. Moses not worthy. Uh
[1:03:31] Paul not worthy. Nobody was found
[1:03:33] worthy. So John wept. Yes. Amen. And
[1:03:37] they said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:03:40] Amen. Don't weep, John. For the lion of
[1:03:42] the tribe of Judah had prevailed.
[1:03:45] Praise the Lord. Now, we had a reason
[1:03:47] for that kinsman redeemer. Jesus has
[1:03:51] prevailed to come and to take the book.
[1:03:54] Yes. No one could even look at the book
[1:03:57] up to that point. Not even look at it.
[1:04:00] He could come and he took the book. Yes.
[1:04:03] And he broke the seals and he opened the
[1:04:06] book so that every life that was
[1:04:08] contained in that book now could come
[1:04:10] forth as redeemed before God. Praise the
[1:04:14] Lord. No wonder that when Jesus said it
[1:04:18] was finished. Amen. Oh, there was things
[1:04:21] that he had to still be done. But at
[1:04:23] that point, it all authority, all the
[1:04:25] power, everything was given into his
[1:04:27] hands to be able to take control of it.
[1:04:29] Yes. Amen. And to take that book and to
[1:04:32] break those seals and to open that book,
[1:04:34] and expose that every name, praise God.
[1:04:37] Amen. I can look in that book and it
[1:04:39] might not necessarily be Newton Bennett,
[1:04:41] but I know it's me. Amen. Amen. Cuz my
[1:04:44] name's in that lamb's book of life. Yes.
[1:04:46] Amen. I believe yours is too. That's why
[1:04:48] Brother Brandham said, "You should be
[1:04:50] able to find your name in this book."
[1:04:52] Yes. You should be able to see it when
[1:04:54] God's talking to you personally. Put
[1:04:56] your name in there. Amen. Why? Your name
[1:04:59] was in there anyway. The book of life,
[1:05:02] the the book of redemption, your name is
[1:05:04] in there anyway. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:06] So, your name is in there. You should be
[1:05:08] able to see your name in there. Yes.
[1:05:11] Because the lamb took the book and
[1:05:12] opened it. Yes. And now the names now
[1:05:16] the redemption plan is complete because
[1:05:20] all these names come forth. That's the
[1:05:21] way it was to be in the beginning. Yeah.
[1:05:24] All those names were supposed to come
[1:05:25] forth. Well, we come forth. We come
[1:05:28] forth by procreation then. Yes. Amen.
[1:05:30] Through man and woman come in the world
[1:05:32] speaking lies. But still the names the
[1:05:36] lamb's book of life. That doesn't
[1:05:37] change. That was from before the
[1:05:39] foundation of the world friends that
[1:05:40] your name was put on the lamb's book of
[1:05:43] life. Yes. That could not change. But
[1:05:46] when God came when Jesus came forth and
[1:05:48] opened that book then all the names that
[1:05:50] that were there came forth. But Adam so
[1:05:53] Adam lost that.
[1:05:56] But now when he lost the earth and he
[1:05:58] lost the dominion of the earth, it
[1:06:01] didn't change that man could have
[1:06:03] dominion over the earth yet. But he was
[1:06:05] no longer the god of the earth because
[1:06:08] he had lost it to Satan, the one he had
[1:06:11] lost it to. That's why we live in
[1:06:13] Satan's Eden. That's right. He lost this
[1:06:16] earth and everything about it he lost to
[1:06:17] the devil. Well, then no wonder no
[1:06:20] wonder all of creation then is groaning
[1:06:23] and waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:06:25] sons of God. Yes, because everything
[1:06:28] botney life, animal life, human life,
[1:06:30] the whales, the birds were all created
[1:06:33] out of this earth.
[1:06:36] Well, if this if everything was created
[1:06:38] out of this earth and this earth was
[1:06:40] lost to the devil, then everything that
[1:06:43] that was in it or part of it was now in
[1:06:46] his control. Right. And now we see it in
[1:06:49] the fallen condition that it's in today.
[1:06:51] Yes. Even human life in its fallen
[1:06:54] condition like it is today. That's why
[1:06:56] we see it that way because all of
[1:06:58] creation was done that way. Now you see
[1:07:00] humans now acting lower than the animal,
[1:07:05] worse than the animal. Amen. Look at
[1:07:08] this. In the breach message, brother
[1:07:10] said, "Oh my, now the forfeited title
[1:07:14] deed is now in the hands of the original
[1:07:16] owner, Almighty God. The title deed
[1:07:18] which we spoke of
[1:07:22] the title deed to the earth the etern
[1:07:23] and eternal life when Adam forfeit
[1:07:26] it Satan's dirty hands could not take it
[1:07:29] so it went back to the original owner
[1:07:30] God himself going to find out here in a
[1:07:33] few minutes he talks about the throne in
[1:07:34] the hands of God we read that or we
[1:07:36] talked about Revelation 5 you can go
[1:07:38] read that title deed of a of eternal
[1:07:41] life abstract title deed of eternal life
[1:07:44] Adam forfeited for wisdom instead of
[1:07:46] faith went back in the hands of the
[1:07:48] original owner almighty God what a great
[1:07:50] thing. He said, "What is it doing now in
[1:07:52] the hands of God? Waiting for redemption
[1:07:56] claims."
[1:07:57] Praise the Lord. Waiting for redemption
[1:08:00] claims. Well, now what is all of
[1:08:02] creation? Waiting for the manifestation
[1:08:03] of the sons of God. That is to with the
[1:08:05] redemption of our bodies. The
[1:08:09] completion is that redemptive claims,
[1:08:12] the redemption of our mortal bodies, the
[1:08:15] changing of our mortal
[1:08:17] bodies, the changing of our addresses.
[1:08:21] Amen. From earth to heaven. Amen. He
[1:08:24] made a way of redemption. He made a way
[1:08:26] back. And someday the redeemer is going
[1:08:29] to take it back. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:40] Praise the Lord. He's talking about
[1:08:42] abstract. When sin's been confessed,
[1:08:44] falls in the blood of Jesus. Gives the
[1:08:46] abstract right back to the creator
[1:08:48] again. Becomes you become a son of God.
[1:08:52] Its redemption. Now look at this. Its
[1:08:55] redemption means all legal
[1:08:58] possession to all that was lost by Adam
[1:09:01] and Eve. He said, "Oh my, what thou
[1:09:04] ought to do to born again Christian,
[1:09:06] it's legal possession to the abstract
[1:09:09] deed, title deed of eternal life means
[1:09:14] because your name is in the blame's book
[1:09:15] of life. Your name is in that book of
[1:09:18] redemption means that you now
[1:09:22] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:09:25] lost." Amen. Praise the Lord. What did
[1:09:28] we just say Adam had control
[1:09:30] over? Amen. Now it belongs to you. Yes.
[1:09:34] All that he lost now belongs to us. You
[1:09:37] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:09:40] lost. No wonder Jesus could say if you
[1:09:43] at the faith grand of a mustard seed say
[1:09:45] this mountain move and it has to be
[1:09:46] moved. Cast into the sea. No wonder he
[1:09:49] said that. Amen. Because it's in the
[1:09:52] possession of those whose names are in
[1:09:53] the lamb's book of life. Your name if
[1:09:55] you're a believer. If you're a
[1:09:56] Christian, if you're a born again
[1:09:58] Christian, if your name's in that lamb's
[1:09:59] book of life, if your name is in that
[1:10:01] book of redemption, it belongs to you.
[1:10:03] Yes. Amen. Then what do we run from the
[1:10:05] devil for? What do we fret when things
[1:10:08] like this happen? Why is it drive us
[1:10:10] crazy when uh things are sickness or
[1:10:13] something happens? Why why is it that we
[1:10:15] we get so scared and worried? God's
[1:10:18] always protecting you. List the
[1:10:19] testimonies we've had just in the few
[1:10:21] testimonies had here today of God's
[1:10:24] protection and leadership. Yes, he's
[1:10:25] help. He's always there. His angels who
[1:10:27] camped around about those who fear him.
[1:10:29] Amen. What What is there to fear then?
[1:10:32] Everything Adam and Eve lost is now in
[1:10:34] your possession. We just got to take it
[1:10:36] by faith and use it. Take it like
[1:10:39] brother Brandham did when he was up in
[1:10:40] the Sabino Canyon and that sword came
[1:10:43] into his hand and he said, "Now it takes
[1:10:45] the faith, the hand of faith to drive
[1:10:48] that sword to the heart of the enemy."
[1:10:50] Yes. Praise the Lord. It takes that
[1:10:52] sword of faith. The sword is the word
[1:10:55] that word of that sword of faith to
[1:10:56] drive it to the heart of the enemy. It
[1:10:59] belongs to you. It's your possession.
[1:11:01] It's ours. Everything he lost belongs to
[1:11:03] us. Now you can
[1:11:05] say tree move. Amen. Amen. We have
[1:11:10] control. Brother Random going Brother's
[1:11:12] going across a field. Amen. And a killer
[1:11:16] bull comes and faces him head on. Right.
[1:11:20] He reaches for his gun because he's a
[1:11:22] human.
[1:11:23] Yeah, the prophet of God is human. He
[1:11:26] reached for his gun. That's the first
[1:11:27] thing any of us would think. That's the
[1:11:29] first thing I would think. Amen. I'm
[1:11:31] about to die and I'm going to use what
[1:11:33] I've got to kill him first. So, he
[1:11:36] reached for his gun first. Gun. He left
[1:11:38] it back in the truck. He had nothing. He
[1:11:42] could not run to where he was going.
[1:11:43] It's too far away. He could not run to
[1:11:45] go back where he came from. Too far
[1:11:47] away. That bull would have gotten him.
[1:11:49] So, he stood there in a precarious
[1:11:51] position. What is he going to do? What
[1:11:53] would any of us
[1:11:55] do? Amen. Faced with death, what would
[1:11:58] you do? Staring that bull, snorting,
[1:12:00] coming out of his nose. What would you
[1:12:03] do? A a hoof going back just ready to
[1:12:06] charge, ready to take him out. What do
[1:12:09] you
[1:12:10] do? He said, then a spirit came over
[1:12:12] him. A spirit of
[1:12:15] love. And instead of wanting to kill and
[1:12:18] shoot the bull, he loved him.
[1:12:21] This is God's creation.
[1:12:24] Let's go back to where it was when Adam
[1:12:26] was in control of it. Amen. That's why
[1:12:29] all creation is waiting for the
[1:12:30] manifestation of the sons of God. Amen.
[1:12:33] Amen. Instead of wanting to kill him and
[1:12:36] shoot
[1:12:37] him, he said,
[1:12:39] "Bo, I'm I'm paraphrasing, of course.
[1:12:42] I'm sorry I've crossed your land. I've
[1:12:45] trespassed on your land. I apologize,
[1:12:48] but there's someone over here that needs
[1:12:50] prayer. I'm going to go pray for that
[1:12:52] person. Would you just let me pass and I
[1:12:54] won't disturb you anymore? Something
[1:12:55] like that. He said that bull just went
[1:12:57] over, laid down, just curled up and laid
[1:12:59] down on the ground. Brother ran and
[1:13:02] walked over, went over to prayed for the
[1:13:04] lady, and came back.
[1:13:07] Amen. That bull was ready. That's again,
[1:13:10] that's why they put tigers and lions in
[1:13:14] cages at zoos. Okay. If they don't,
[1:13:17] right? That bull's ready to kill him.
[1:13:19] But a manifested son of God stood there
[1:13:23] and God took control of the situation.
[1:13:27] Love came and conquered every bit of
[1:13:29] hate, every bit of desire to destroy,
[1:13:33] even control an animal who has not a
[1:13:36] soul to go over and lay down and let him
[1:13:39] go
[1:13:42] by. What's it going to be like, saints?
[1:13:46] Amen. It's getting back. We're going
[1:13:49] back to that place. Yes. You said,
[1:13:51] "What? You you you can't let the lion
[1:13:53] out and tell them, you know, uh, I beg
[1:13:55] your pardon given the circumstance,
[1:13:58] given the situation. Why you think Jesus
[1:14:00] come walking across the water to the
[1:14:02] boat?"
[1:14:05] He had dominion over the waters. Yes.
[1:14:07] Over the seas. Why do you think Peter
[1:14:10] was able to do it? He had enough faith
[1:14:12] at least for that moment to do it
[1:14:14] himself. Right? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:14:17] Help us to recognize we are those
[1:14:20] people. We are a part of that bride. We
[1:14:22] are a part of that whose names are in
[1:14:25] that book of lamb's book of life, that
[1:14:27] book of redemption. We are those ones
[1:14:29] who have that control. It's in our
[1:14:32] authority. Praise the Lord. Belongs to
[1:14:35] us.
[1:14:37] I I I just you know I just
[1:14:40] everything that Adam and Eve lost is in
[1:14:43] our possession now.
[1:14:46] Praise the Lord. Think of all he did.
[1:14:48] Could speak, could name, could say, he
[1:14:51] could uh do what he wanted. It was it
[1:14:54] was in his life. But he did it only
[1:14:56] according to the will of God. The
[1:14:58] purpose of God that God put it in him.
[1:15:00] Amen.
[1:15:04] Amen. Look at this. marriage and
[1:15:06] divorce. Now the world is to re be
[1:15:10] repopulated not by now brother Random
[1:15:13] even said
[1:15:14] repopulated not by the original creation
[1:15:17] of God like it was at the beginning
[1:15:19] God's creation not by the original
[1:15:22] creation but by sex desire you said now
[1:15:25] that takes the beginning doesn't it in
[1:15:27] the beginning there was only one man one
[1:15:29] woman one male one female but when she
[1:15:31] crossed that line and brought this sin
[1:15:34] now this world is to be repopulated
[1:15:37] again by sex not by creation. See where
[1:15:40] the woman he sees is now populated today
[1:15:43] through the woman. That's the reason
[1:15:46] Jesus had to come through the woman to
[1:15:49] bring it back to its original beginning
[1:15:51] again without the sex desire but a
[1:15:54] virgin birth. Praise the Lord. The
[1:15:57] beginning of the breaking of the curse
[1:16:00] and the original sin from the Garden of
[1:16:02] Eden. Amen. We know the finish of that
[1:16:05] will be in the millennium, right? The
[1:16:07] finish of that curse will be in the
[1:16:09] millennium where God lets a man live for
[1:16:11] a thousand years because man's never
[1:16:13] lived one day with God, a thousand years
[1:16:15] on the earth since the fall, right? 969
[1:16:19] is as close as they got with Methuselah.
[1:16:21] But not no man has lived 1,000 years
[1:16:24] because of the curse. Well, the
[1:16:25] millennium will finish that. Jesus here
[1:16:29] started it. Amen. Jesus come through a
[1:16:33] virgin birth through a woman to break
[1:16:35] that sin. Amen. Now he said, "But
[1:16:40] hallelujah, there will come a time where
[1:16:42] it won't be no more sex, but God shall
[1:16:45] call his children." That's what he's
[1:16:47] getting to now. That God will call his
[1:16:50] children from the dust of the earth back
[1:16:53] like they was in the original. Not
[1:16:55] through a woman, but creation. Amen.
[1:16:59] Praise God. But through the molding of
[1:17:02] the clay, the cosmite, petroleum, he
[1:17:04] will create again like he did Adam at
[1:17:07] the first. That's the way it's going
[1:17:09] back to. Yes. No wonder. Again, it just
[1:17:14] brings us back to the to the
[1:17:16] understanding and thankfulness. No
[1:17:18] wonder all of creation is groaning,
[1:17:22] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:17:24] sons of God because we're trying we're
[1:17:27] getting back to that place. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:30] Oh, praise the Lord. First seal, let me
[1:17:32] read this. In the first seal, I won't
[1:17:36] keep I won't stay too much longer.
[1:17:38] said, "Notice here, uh, he took his
[1:17:42] bride, but when, uh, them boys come down
[1:17:46] to buy food." Oh, such a beautiful
[1:17:48] picture. Uh, he's talking about, um, um,
[1:17:53] uh, Jacob and his sons and Egypt and the
[1:17:58] the u the, the famine in Egypt and
[1:18:01] Joseph being down there and the boys
[1:18:03] going to the others going to buy food.
[1:18:06] That's the story he told me. It was such
[1:18:07] a beautiful picture. I'm off this hill,
[1:18:10] but just to say it cuz you'll get the
[1:18:11] picture better, I believe. Notice now
[1:18:14] when they come down to buy food, you
[1:18:15] notice Joseph recognized them right
[1:18:18] away. Amen. Because Joseph was already
[1:18:21] in
[1:18:22] Egypt. He was second in control, second
[1:18:25] in command. Joseph recognized him right
[1:18:28] away. And Joseph was the son of
[1:18:30] prosperity. No matter where he went, it
[1:18:33] always prospered. Amen. He said, "You
[1:18:36] wait." Look at this now. Why creation's
[1:18:40] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:18:42] sons of God? He said, "You wait now till
[1:18:44] he comes to earth
[1:18:46] again. Wait till our Joseph comes."
[1:18:50] Jesus Christ, not Joseph Brown, which a
[1:18:53] lot of people put him in there. Jesus
[1:18:56] Christ, not Joseph Brown. So, you're
[1:18:59] watching. It's Amen. Wait till Brother
[1:19:02] Bam says, "Wait till our Joseph's come."
[1:19:04] But he's talking about Jesus Christ. The
[1:19:08] desert shall blossom as a rose. The
[1:19:11] desert shall blossom as a rose. And the
[1:19:15] son of righteousness rising with healing
[1:19:18] in his wings. Oh my. All that
[1:19:21] cactus over here around Arizona will
[1:19:25] unfold into beautiful trees in there.
[1:19:28] Amen. The Lord.
[1:19:30] Amen. Now, that's a great promise to me.
[1:19:33] I like that promise. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:36] I'm not a fan of stickers and thorns and
[1:19:38] stuff. So when they think about them
[1:19:40] unfolding into beautiful trees, I like
[1:19:42] that. Amen. It says no more curse. Sun
[1:19:46] will rise with healing in his wings. All
[1:19:48] these cactus round Arizona will unfold
[1:19:50] into beautiful trees in there. Praise
[1:19:53] the Lord. When what? Now, see, you can't
[1:19:55] you can't place this people who place
[1:19:59] Jesus coming to earth for the second uh
[1:20:02] for for this rapture is just flat wrong.
[1:20:06] Amen. Because brother Brandham even says
[1:20:08] here, according to the scripture, when
[1:20:11] Jesus comes back on earth, when he when
[1:20:15] he's here on earth, which will not be
[1:20:17] the rapture, we go to meet him in the
[1:20:19] air, right? Amen. When he comes back on
[1:20:22] the earth and he's here planted on the
[1:20:25] earth is when all this will be made
[1:20:27] perfect again.
[1:20:29] Botney life, animal life, human life
[1:20:32] will all be exactly in its perfect
[1:20:35] condition, perfect way. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:38] That's why all creation's waiting for
[1:20:39] it. Amen. That's why we're waiting for
[1:20:42] it. Praise the Lord
[1:20:45] Jesus. Amen. Want to make sure I get
[1:20:48] there's a couple in here I wanted to
[1:20:49] make sure and to us here
[1:20:52] today. He talked, Brother Ram talked
[1:20:54] about the three stages of the earth.
[1:20:56] Now, we know, brother Ram said here that
[1:21:00] that all of God's possession was to be
[1:21:04] redeemed back
[1:21:06] again. So everything that was God's,
[1:21:09] which is everything, and that God
[1:21:12] created was to come back in his
[1:21:14] possession again. We know that the book,
[1:21:16] the lamb's book of life. We know the
[1:21:18] book of redemption could not fall into
[1:21:20] the filthy hands of Satan. So, it went
[1:21:22] back to the original owner of God. We
[1:21:24] know that we talked about Revelation 5
[1:21:26] set in there book in his hand. And we
[1:21:29] know that all that creation, but we also
[1:21:31] know the earth, this became Satan's ego
[1:21:34] and the thorns came out and the lion
[1:21:36] wanted to kill the lamb and all these uh
[1:21:38] things that were not in the original
[1:21:40] creation. It's going to be redeemed
[1:21:42] back. has to be brought back to its
[1:21:44] original place. Amen. Now, you see what
[1:21:47] God through in uh in in his redemption
[1:21:51] plan. We know he has a redemption plan
[1:21:54] for us. We know what that three-stage
[1:21:56] redemption plan is. Amen. Repentance,
[1:21:59] baptism, and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:01] Three-step process. Justification,
[1:22:03] sanctification, Holy Ghost. We know what
[1:22:05] that process is. God has that same
[1:22:08] process for the earth. Everything else
[1:22:10] God lost. Everything else that Adam
[1:22:13] lost, I should say. Everything else that
[1:22:15] was lost in the hands of Satan has to be
[1:22:17] redeemed back the same way. Amen. Look
[1:22:20] at what brother Bram says here. Future
[1:22:22] home, the heavenly bridegroom and
[1:22:24] earthly bride. Notice the Andaluvia
[1:22:26] world which was after the fall and
[1:22:29] before the flood.
[1:22:32] He after it had
[1:22:34] repented by through he said by through
[1:22:37] the bride of that day Noah he gave it a
[1:22:41] water baptism covered it over with
[1:22:44] water. Amen. So we see that God began
[1:22:47] the process like he began the process
[1:22:50] with us to bring this earth back into
[1:22:52] his possession again. He's redeeming
[1:22:55] this earth back just like he redeemed
[1:22:57] you back. a part of the earth. He gave
[1:23:00] this uh earth a watery baptism water all
[1:23:04] o covered the whole
[1:23:06] earth. Then justification that uh
[1:23:10] showing that he's on his road to cause
[1:23:13] this fallen world from Eden back to its
[1:23:16] restoration again. People think and mock
[1:23:19] the flood. They mock a man building an
[1:23:22] ark. They mock animals coming two by two
[1:23:26] on this ark. They mock the whole world
[1:23:28] being filled with water. They mock the
[1:23:31] uh the water receiving people mock and
[1:23:34] scoff over all of these things. No way
[1:23:36] any of this can happen. But the only way
[1:23:39] that God was to redeem this by his
[1:23:41] process to redeem this earth back, he
[1:23:43] had to give it a a water baptism. Right?
[1:23:46] Amen.
[1:23:47] Justification, showing that he's on his
[1:23:51] road to call this fallen world from Eden
[1:23:54] back to restoration again. Right. Praise
[1:23:57] the Lord. Back to where it's supposed to
[1:24:00] be.
[1:24:02] Then Christ came and he shed his blood
[1:24:06] upon it. Me and Brother Dennis talked
[1:24:07] about that the other day.
[1:24:09] Amen. Shed his blood upon it. Amen. The
[1:24:14] chemistry of the blood fell into the
[1:24:16] earth. We know the life of the blood
[1:24:19] left and came back on the believer, the
[1:24:22] worshipper. But the chemistry of the
[1:24:23] blood fell onto the earth to redeem the
[1:24:26] earth back. So the part of you that you
[1:24:30] came from this earth was to be redeemed
[1:24:33] as well by the dropping of the blood of
[1:24:35] Jesus Christ. Just like the life of the
[1:24:38] blood of Jesus Christ come you today to
[1:24:41] save your soul.
[1:24:43] Praise God. Amen. God didn't want to
[1:24:46] just save your soul. All of you belongs
[1:24:49] to God. Amen. Not just your soul. All of
[1:24:53] you belongs to God. All of you is his
[1:24:56] creation. Your human life, your your
[1:24:59] flesh, your spirit, all of you belongs
[1:25:01] to God. So God dropped his blood on this
[1:25:04] earth to redeem this earth which you are
[1:25:08] a part of to bring it back into
[1:25:10] redemption again. Yes. Praise God. Now
[1:25:14] this body, even though it may go in the
[1:25:16] ground, this spirit will come back and
[1:25:19] pick up that body one day in a glorified
[1:25:21] condition. Amen. Because it still
[1:25:24] belongs to God. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:27] And when he did that, it also redeemed
[1:25:29] back his botney life. It also redeemed
[1:25:32] back his animal life. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:36] Everything that was God's, everything
[1:25:38] that he had created, brought it back to
[1:25:40] its life again. That's when he shed his
[1:25:43] blood and cleansed it and claimed it.
[1:25:46] Amen. It says on here that brother Brown
[1:25:49] knocked on the pull pit several times.
[1:25:51] I'll do it, too. See, that's the world
[1:25:53] that we live in now. See how Satan here
[1:25:56] in the scripture tried to make him break
[1:25:58] God's plan to receive
[1:26:00] it on the Mount Temptation. To receive
[1:26:03] it, give it to him uh when he took him
[1:26:06] up on the mountain and tried to give it
[1:26:08] him without the purchase of the blood.
[1:26:09] God's got that redemptive plan. Bring it
[1:26:11] back. Now he's getting ready to burn it
[1:26:13] all off. Now he's given it a water
[1:26:16] baptism, a blood baptism, and now a
[1:26:18] fiery baptism. Praise the Lord. Which is
[1:26:21] what the Holy Ghost then fire does.
[1:26:24] Burns out all your old nature. So the
[1:26:26] spirit of Christ, God, Christ himself
[1:26:28] can come live in you. The earth same
[1:26:30] way. Water baptism, blood dropped on.
[1:26:33] Now a fiery baptism is about to
[1:26:36] completely overhaul the entire earth.
[1:26:38] Like we said the other day, even to the
[1:26:39] point the atmospheres explode, the earth
[1:26:42] comes back to its proper uh proper axis
[1:26:45] again. Amen. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:26:48] It's it's it's it's a no wonder that the
[1:26:51] that the whole creation is growing,
[1:26:54] waiting for me,
[1:26:58] you waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:27:01] sons of God. Yes. Praise the Lord. You
[1:27:03] are one of them. I am one of them.
[1:27:06] All of that in my possession, all of
[1:27:08] that that was lost belongs to me. It's
[1:27:11] God's it's God's promise to me. It's
[1:27:14] God's life given to me. Amen. Adam lost
[1:27:18] his inheritance in the earth. Amen. Fell
[1:27:21] into the hands of Satan. When he fell in
[1:27:25] that fallen nature, animal life fell.
[1:27:28] Human nature fell. Man
[1:27:31] then
[1:27:33] man shifted to procreation which was
[1:27:37] original sin and began the fall to begin
[1:27:38] with. Amen. Was never God's plan. But
[1:27:42] we're getting to that place. Yes. We're
[1:27:44] getting to that place. God's calling
[1:27:48] again. Not from the dust of the earth
[1:27:50] this time. And he's taken care of that
[1:27:53] to redeem that back out of the hands of
[1:27:56] Satan. Amen. Makes you wonder if he ever
[1:28:00] if Satan had ever known all of that, he
[1:28:02] would have done what he did.
[1:28:06] It's like brother Brandham said, I had
[1:28:07] another quote here, but I'll skip that.
[1:28:09] But he talks about man getting so smart
[1:28:12] that they'll destroy themselves.
[1:28:15] And that's what man's getting to. Yes.
[1:28:17] Man's becoming so smart they're going to
[1:28:19] kill themselves. are going to destroy
[1:28:21] theirelves. They're bickering and
[1:28:23] fighting over this getting the nuclear
[1:28:25] weapon and that one having a nuclear
[1:28:26] weapon and this one using it, this one
[1:28:29] not using it. Whatever. Doesn't matter.
[1:28:33] It's all going to be burned over,
[1:28:34] destroyed, blasted apart anyway. They
[1:28:37] just I guess just trying to hold back
[1:28:39] the wrath as long as they can. But it's
[1:28:42] not going to be for much longer. Saints,
[1:28:44] I believe we're getting ready to go back
[1:28:45] home. Amen.
[1:28:47] See the bright light shine. Amen. Praise
[1:28:50] the Lord. It is just about home time.
[1:28:53] Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's stand
[1:28:55] to our feet if we could.
[1:29:03] Oh, see that bright light shine. Praise
[1:29:06] the Lord. It is just about home
[1:29:09] time.
[1:29:11] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:15] We sing that chorus a couple times.
[1:29:18] Amen. I just love that. See that bright
[1:29:22] light shining. Looking for my family
[1:29:24] anytime. Just see father standing at the
[1:29:28] door. Amen. Looking for my loved ones to
[1:29:31] appear at any time, saints. Cuz that's
[1:29:34] how close we are.
[1:29:36] Amen. Amen. See the bright light shine.
[1:29:42] It's just about home
[1:29:45] time. Well, I can see my father standing
[1:29:50] at the
[1:29:52] door. This world's been a
[1:29:56] wilderness, but I'm ready for
[1:30:00] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[1:30:04] whole sick
[1:30:07] before. Yes. See the bright light shine.
[1:30:12] It's just my whole
[1:30:15] time. I can't see my father standing at
[1:30:21] the
[1:30:22] door. This whole world's been a
[1:30:26] wilderness, but I'm ready for
[1:30:30] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[1:30:34] whole sick before. Let's sing it again.
[1:30:38] Yeah. See the bright light shine. It's
[1:30:42] just about home
[1:30:45] time. I can't see my father standing at
[1:30:50] the door. Hallelujah. This world's been
[1:30:54] a
[1:30:55] wilderness, but I'm ready for
[1:30:59] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[1:31:03] home sick before. One more time now.
[1:31:07] Just see the bright light shine. It's
[1:31:11] just about home
[1:31:14] time. I can't see my father standing at
[1:31:20] the
[1:31:21] door. This world's been a
[1:31:24] wilderness, but I'm ready for
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:29] deliverance. Lord, I've never been this
[1:31:32] home sick before.
[1:31:36] Amen. Amen. Oh,
[1:31:39] hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I get
[1:31:42] more and more homesick every day,
[1:31:44] saints. Praise the Lord. Every day, more
[1:31:47] and more. I'm looking forward to that
[1:31:50] time. Amen. Amen. He says, "Enter into
[1:31:54] the joys of the Lord." Was well done, my
[1:31:57] good and faithful servant. Amen. Oh,
[1:31:59] praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. It's
[1:32:02] just about home time, saints. Amen. It's
[1:32:05] about time to go home. I'm looking
[1:32:07] forward to that. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:10] God bless you today. Pray if something
[1:32:13] was said to bless and strengthen you in
[1:32:14] some
[1:32:16] way. Take that faith with grain of
[1:32:18] mustard seed. Yes. Amen. Put that devil
[1:32:21] in his place. He has no right over
[1:32:23] dominion over you. Yes. Amen. He has no
[1:32:27] dominion over you. This might be Satan's
[1:32:28] eating now, but he has no dominion over
[1:32:31] you. Yes. Praise the Lord. Greater is he
[1:32:34] that is in us than he that is in this
[1:32:36] world. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:32:39] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen.
[1:32:42] We'll be dismissed in a word of prayer,
[1:32:43] but
[1:32:45] um I it it is very likely that I will
[1:32:48] not be working next week. So, uh there's
[1:32:52] no schedule change, if you will. In
[1:32:54] fact, uh there's a good chance I won't
[1:32:57] work anymore until June. Um, so, uh, far
[1:33:02] as I know, I'll probably be home unless
[1:33:04] something changes. Uh, they just don't
[1:33:06] have any more work. They've run out of
[1:33:09] work for new builds. A lot of the new
[1:33:11] builds that were supposed to be coming
[1:33:12] up have gotten pushed back. Uh, so they
[1:33:16] think maybe end of June, into July, and
[1:33:18] so forth, it's going to be really
[1:33:20] slammed with new builds. But right now,
[1:33:23] we've done all our all our crews have
[1:33:26] done pretty much all the uh what they
[1:33:29] call capex's, which is pretty much
[1:33:31] repairs and stuff, major repairs to uh
[1:33:35] facilities around the country. We we've
[1:33:37] done pretty much all of them. They're
[1:33:39] all done. So, there's really no place to
[1:33:43] send us. Uh still get paid, thank the
[1:33:46] Lord. I won't get paid as much, but uh
[1:33:50] I'll get paid something. So, it's it's
[1:33:52] better it's better than nothing. Yes.
[1:33:55] So, so there's no change in church
[1:33:58] schedule uh right now. Me and my wife
[1:34:01] are going on our 40th anniversary trip.
[1:34:04] Uh we're going to leave on the 20th of
[1:34:06] May and come back on the fourth or 5th
[1:34:09] of June. I'm not sure yet. Uh maybe the
[1:34:12] fifth. We'll see. I'm kind of trying to
[1:34:14] figure out how much how long it's going
[1:34:16] to take to
[1:34:19] basically travel the northeast of the
[1:34:21] New England, which is where we're trying
[1:34:22] to go. Uh, so I'm not sure, but we're
[1:34:25] leaving the 20th, but as far as church
[1:34:28] is concerned, uh, I don't have the dates
[1:34:31] on me, but the TW from the the Sunday
[1:34:34] from the 20th to June,
[1:34:38] uh, I guess that would be 9th. Uh, we
[1:34:42] don't we're not going to have any
[1:34:43] church, so we we won't be here. So, uh,
[1:34:46] after that, whatever those dates are,
[1:34:48] I'd like to give I could text them to
[1:34:50] you too uh after a while. But um so the
[1:34:55] 20 May 25th
[1:34:58] uh Mike is going to be leaving too. Uh
[1:35:00] Mike is going on a cruise for his birth.
[1:35:02] I guess it's her birthday. He's just
[1:35:03] going on a cruise. His birthday is 26.
[1:35:05] So u so he'll be gone too, but 25th will
[1:35:08] be no service. Uh June 1st there'll be
[1:35:11] no service. Uh so two two Sundays we
[1:35:15] will be gone. Uh we'll be back on June
[1:35:17] 8th. So we'll have church obviously
[1:35:19] we'll have church next week and on the
[1:35:22] 18th but 25th and 1st there will be not
[1:35:26] there will not be any service here. So
[1:35:28] please remember that in prayer I will um
[1:35:31] mark it on your calendar whatever I will
[1:35:33] try to rem remind you the next couple
[1:35:35] Sundays maybe even text while we're gone
[1:35:38] to make sure that uh you remember that
[1:35:41] that that there won't be any service for
[1:35:44] those two Sundays. So, so I appreciate
[1:35:47] that. Please remember that. Um, and I
[1:35:50] need to get Anna's number. I need to
[1:35:52] make sure they know, too. Anna and
[1:35:54] Steve, if they're moving back to Tucson,
[1:35:56] uh, I need to make sure they know, too.
[1:35:58] I haven't got her number or his number
[1:36:00] yet. So, I want to remember, make sure
[1:36:02] they know, too. Um, so please keep that
[1:36:06] in mind. Remember that. So, Lord Rich,
[1:36:10] bless you. I got the week I got the last
[1:36:13] week of May off at work and I don't we
[1:36:15] may not even work that week anyway. I
[1:36:16] don't know. Supposed to be scheduled now
[1:36:18] to go to Wisconsin, but that could
[1:36:20] change, they said. So, we'll just wait
[1:36:22] and see what happens there. But anyway,
[1:36:24] I'll be gone. So, I'd already gotten
[1:36:26] permission to uh go because our
[1:36:29] anniversary, our actual anniversary day
[1:36:32] is May 31st and it falls on the week
[1:36:35] that I'm supposed to work. So, uh I
[1:36:38] asked the boss, the boss boss and
[1:36:41] So, um, we're okay with that. So, I
[1:36:45] appreciate that. I guess everybody saw
[1:36:47] the barber shop moved out finally.
[1:36:50] Barber shop's gone. You didn't notice?
[1:36:52] Oh, it's empty as can be. They took the
[1:36:54] sign off the front. It's all gone. So,
[1:36:57] they emptied after what we talked about
[1:36:59] last week with praying and the tattoo
[1:37:01] shop and the smoke shop and uh what I'd
[1:37:04] said about I told you what I was saying
[1:37:06] about that place. Uh, but I I've been
[1:37:10] fine with them. They haven't been I mean
[1:37:12] just they mess up the bathrooms and
[1:37:14] stuff, but anyway, but they're gone now.
[1:37:16] So, I uh I I told Craig that when it
[1:37:21] came open to let me know. He probably
[1:37:23] forgot, but I was going to try to rent
[1:37:26] that side and have that side and this
[1:37:29] side and then open the wall right there.
[1:37:31] And then you could just go to the
[1:37:32] bathrooms, close this entrance, uh lock
[1:37:35] that entrance, and just keep my office
[1:37:37] in there and make the school out here
[1:37:39] and um have a Sunday school room, but my
[1:37:43] Sunday school teacher left, so u so we
[1:37:46] probably probably won't be able to do it
[1:37:49] now. So, we'll just stay where we're at,
[1:37:51] I guess, for now. But I was kind of
[1:37:53] hoping we could get that we could have
[1:37:55] dinners and stuff and uh but anyway,
[1:37:58] Lord knows these would probably want
[1:38:01] more for that place than than we'll pay
[1:38:03] it here. But uh anyway, so we'll see
[1:38:07] what happens. just be in prayer that uh
[1:38:10] you know some people whatever comes in
[1:38:13] there are good people and not rowdy and
[1:38:16] if the Lord speaks to me to get it I'll
[1:38:17] get it just uh right now it's just not
[1:38:20] financially fe feasible but if he says
[1:38:23] get it he'll pay the bill so I don't
[1:38:24] worry about it
[1:38:26] but right now we'll see we'll see what
[1:38:30] happens so
[1:38:32] anyway but I was just surprised and we
[1:38:35] Monday we came by when I went to go pick
[1:38:38] Sonia up and we came by this way. She's
[1:38:39] like, "Hey, they're moving out." I
[1:38:42] didn't even know we came by, looked
[1:38:43] today. It's completely empty. So anyway,
[1:38:47] Lord bless you. Appreciate each of you
[1:38:49] coming and being here today. If you're
[1:38:51] watching, God bless you. Still with us.
[1:38:53] We'll be dismissed in a word of prayer.
[1:38:55] Yes, sister. Next Sunday is Mother's
[1:38:58] Day. It is. Yes.
[1:39:05] Our plans are for church. Okay. Yeah,
[1:39:07] everybody, as far as I know, nobody has
[1:39:10] said anything to me, so I'm assuming.
[1:39:12] Uh, it's a lot easier to have less
[1:39:13] conflict when you have a lot less
[1:39:15] people.
[1:39:16] But, but, um, I don't necessarily like
[1:39:20] that. But, uh, but yeah, as far as I
[1:39:22] know, nobody has conflict. But yeah,
[1:39:24] next week is Mother's Day, next Sunday.
[1:39:26] So, let anybody slip anybody's
[1:39:30] mind. Anything
[1:39:34] else? Lord bless you. be dismissed in a
[1:39:37] word of prayer. appreciate love each
[1:39:43] father god we come to you close of the
[1:39:46] service
[1:39:47] father time you've given us to gather
[1:39:49] together yes worship song what you have
[1:39:54] through our pastor Lord Jesus and
[1:39:56] reminding us of so many things that
[1:39:58] we've heard before but just that we
[1:39:59] continue to apply it and take it to our
[1:40:02] hearts and our our lives Lord Jesus and
[1:40:04] share it with our families and our
[1:40:05] friends people that would come across
[1:40:08] and like Danny said just to to be
[1:40:10] Christians and have have a spirit about
[1:40:12] us and where we go that everyone knows
[1:40:14] that there's something different. Yes.
[1:40:16] Amen. Continue to be with us our needs
[1:40:19] if we're having physical, financial,
[1:40:21] mental, Lord Jesus, whatever it might
[1:40:23] be. We lay them at your feet, Lord, as
[1:40:25] we walk out this door today to come back
