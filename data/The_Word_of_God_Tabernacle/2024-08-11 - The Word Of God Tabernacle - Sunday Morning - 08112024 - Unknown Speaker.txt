Jesus praise the Lord had a couple prayer requests to mention to you today uh as you I'm sure you've noticed uh Zach and Tabitha the kids aren't here Zach and Tabitha's anniversary was this weekend they're this week or coming up it's the 12th right I think it's the 12th I think it's August 12th anyway tomorrow but they went this weekend to go an anniversary trip so me and Son's been taking care of the kids yesterday and today and uh Sonia is still on her way um I thought she'd have been here by now but anyway uh it's little tougher I I had to ditch her this morning because I come to church way earlier than she does so uh I told Mike I told Joel he's going to have to be the man of the house so uh help s in every way he can so uh she U Ruth still getting used to being in church so she was plan on coming a little maybe halfway through song service so they should be here shortly but Zach and tabith are still in Phoenix uh enjoying their anniversary trip so pray that the Lord just bless them and bring them back home safe U they actually happened to be in the hotel yesterday in Phoenix downtown Phoenix where the Camala Harris was uh of all the places of all the times um they pull in and they stop them and they searched their car and uh why are you here and got a reservation and secur uh uh figures i' forg security the Secret Service secret service thank you uh Secret Service cars everywhere so anyway they finally got there and they sound like they were enjoying their time alone last night so uh just pray for them the Lord would just bless them but Tabitha did have requests that she had mentioned uh this week a couple of them uh one was a young uh well was a young was her age a boy that went to school with her up in pintop at Blue Ridge um boy's name is Drew cook uh was in her class in fifth and sixth grade and he died uh this last week uh apparently she doesn't know exactly but apparently it was a job related injury death uh because she's only 30 years old had three children and was engaged to be married um uh so uh please pray for them if you would especially the young ones she found a picture of the um uh somewhere online uh about it all and uh just some cute little kids so uh please pray for them if you would the Lord his name is Drew cook I don't know uh the others but the Lord knows so just please remember them in prayer if you would she also sent me one earlier this week um that I had forgotten about and asked her to remind me when I got home because course I was working this week and she text me I was still working uh but anyway uh it was a woman to see let me just read it to you it probably be easier she said I just met this is tap also she said I just met in a weird way on the modest children's page an older lady who is 70 she's battling bone cancer and in the hospital uh she says which is just really I mean it's kind of strange to meet a 7-year-old on A's child's page who was in the hospital battling bone cancer so you know me I don't believe in coincidence right uh so there there somehow the Lord hooked tap up with this lady U she's had bone cancer in the hospital didn't say where don't know if she's in Tucson or local or where she is she was met her on the internet like I said mon children page uh she says she's on morphine and Norco 10s three times a day does that make sense I don't know she's on morphine and whatever Norco is it says 10s that could be a typo three times a day anyway sounds bad uh so please remember her just she didn't give a name uh but taba said my heart just went out to her and I told her that I would be praying for her and then Tabitha wanted me to ask us called to pray for her too um the good part about this is God knows who's this woman is yes and knows her name and knows why her and taba got connected together uh so taba asked me to ask everyone if they would pray for her and uh so please do if you would pray for this lady don't know her name but anyway the Lord knows so praise the Lord that's all the request I have I'm not sure where others are let's of course continue remember Sister sister Pat sister Karen uh battling some chronic illnesses uh don't see AR sh please pray for them and sister Julie and amen so but we're here we're thankful to be here soen you have any unspoken request on your heart Lord amen I stand to our we just take these to the Lord today and ask brother Dennis if you would brother Jes Jesus I feel like what David said one time I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord yes Lord Jesus we're here father to meet with you we can feel your presence already thank you when said in your word when two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in your midst Lord that's your Hallelujah and it's not you don't go by groups or churches or titles you go by the hearts of your people that are sincere and want to draw closer to you let that deep keep calling out to the Deep for more of God give us that closer walk Lord Jesus we know that the hour is late it's time to be prayed up more than ever before father it's time to watch and pray look for your coming every day the true bride is anticipating that you can come even today Father amen there's another group father that's very sobering in my heart as I speak it it's that foolish version Lord they know the word they know what they need to do but they think that your coming is a far off they think that being a Christian is only at certain times you know they want live the life but they just don't got what it takes to be a real Christian but when they see the bride the true bride the wise virgin is gone that's when they'll seek for that oil oh my but that oil will not be found father Jes the gospel will be returned back to the Jews two prophets will be preaching to the 144,000 and father it it's time to oh let us search our hearts let us put you first in every Lord in our jobs in our homes amongst our neighbors in our when we go to the store anywhere father let your life really speak for us it's the life behind the name that makes the devil tremble and Lord without that life no matter how good we try to produce a Christian Life it's going to fall short Lord Jesus and Lord there are many that are sick among us our precious Brethren that we love so much they're going through some hard trials our sister Lydia father Yes Lord oh you know what she's going through our sister Karen our sister Pat yes Lord our sister Julie Jes oh Lord that request of that lady that has bone cancer 70 years old even younger than myself and my brother Lord she's going through a tough time father above all it wasn't mentioned that she knows you as Lord and savior of her life may she accept you may she call on your name may she invite you into her heart father we believe the best for this lady we believe total and complete deliverance from this cancer and Lord for all the our brethren in that are special and our hearts that batt sickness We Believe total Deliverance for them as well for you are truly our great physician our Jehovah ra our our high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed and Lord bless everyone that raised their hand their hearts were raised to you father Jesus you know what they have need of may you fill their Cup May their cup run over father May their needs be met according to your riches and Glory father Grant it Lord in your name we pray name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord God bless you you could be seated if you'd like amen thank the Lord had a good week this week appreciate your prayers amen pretty hot during the week um but we did get some days that had some clouds that was very helpful and uh I don't think it ever got up to 100 it got up to maybe 96 the hottest so it could have been a lot worse but you know the Southern Arizona Sun when you're out and that sun is the sun it might not be hot out

God bless you amen praise the Lord you'd like to stand with me we're going to go back where we've been over in second Peter and begin our scripture reading there again continue on with this uh spiritual growth subject we've been uh talking on praise the Lord second Peter chapter 1 amen that's where I want to begin here again second Peter chapter 1 amen second Peter chapter one and we begin we we'll just begin down a little further again um probably verse five but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus we're so very thankful father again of the blessings and love that you give us thank you Lord that you give us this place and time Lord to come in from out of the world and to learn of you Lord just to worship and praise you God and feel your spirit is so near god it feels so precious to know God that you are so mindful of us you love us Lord and you give of yourself to us and Lord so many things that we know of even that that that would even come against our natural Humanity our natural carnality and spirit Lord but God you give us the ability the way to be able to overcome all of those things and to and to bring into us God the pure nature of Jesus Christ and the the spirit of the fruits and uh the attributes that go with it Lord we thank you so much for being able to be a partaker lord of that divine nature and being a partaker of your kingdom to be one of them Lord God it means so much to us Lord to know that you have made us mold us shaped us us into your image and before the foundation of the world placed in us God that life Lord put your put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life the book that could never be removed yes thank you Lord that you've shown it to us Lord and it's been revealed God that we know who we are thank you Lord for watching over us and keeping us through the week Lord we come to this place now turning back the pages of this beautiful wonderful R this Bible Lord that we have God this letter Lord that we can read and learn of you and that you could speak to us through it's such a blessing Lord to know God it's not just a textbook that we can read out of a school Lord but it's a it's a living letter it's a living word that lives to us through us and in us thank you God for it Lord we just commit the remaining part of this service to you Lord have your way in it may your Holy Spirit God be pleased with all that is said and done here now as we commit it to you speak to us Lord hear through our ears speak through our lips that what you desire to be accomplished in this service today the purpose you set it for before the foundation of the world would be accomplished Lord in this place right here today we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen second Peter chapter 1 uh we'll begin reading with verse five verse five and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was first from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall amen praise the Lord you can be seated if You' like I really like that last scripture there or that last verse amen if you do these things you shall never fall praise the Lord I'm so glad of that amen so thankful to the Lord that word just means so much if you look at it as PR to us I know we all know this but I fig I'll bring it up a little easier to see as we go through we're just going to do probably get into two today Temperance and patience uh if we could go back to those now uh I want to go into uh uh uh Temperance we went through faith of course and then uh virtue and then knowledge last week and uh we kind of stopped of course we were right at about an hour anyway so we just stopped it there to get into Temperance patience kind of bring these two together maybe a little bit they each stand on their own but they are also uh each sort of intertwined if you will of how Temperance and patience work together now there's a couple of different now again like uh several of these other attributes uh Temperance kind of has two different uh meanings to it uh two different ways when you look at the the root word temper or when you add uh or when you take temper and make it temperate uh make something temperate that means it's tempered it means it's hardened uh when you add temp uh uh Temperance to it that that is uh uh that is something that uh uh is not who you are necessarily if you say uh I I am tempered or or I'm temperate that's a noun uh to have Temperance is something that you express uh something that shows from you amen it shows whether you are temperate it shows whether you do have temper or not amen uh mostly what we look at as far as Temperance is concerned is self-control uh being able to hold your tongue or control your temper uh don't fly off and get angry when you're uh when when maybe you're even spoken badly about uh when uh you have the ability or the sweetness to be able to uh speak good about someone who has spoke bad about you um uh temper is also uh uh the ability to be able to uh have someone not fly off when someone speaks bad about you which of course goes also into the patience be able to uh to have patience to control yourself but uh Temperance also means to be sober yes uh temperer uh means to be uh to be to to be tempered means to be able to con control your anger uh but to temper something also means to solidify it uh someone who is solidified or hardened if you will um uh something that is tempered uh when when uh extreme heat uh or or or or trials if you will uh if Trials come or heavy uh persecution or something comes when the heat comes on uh something that is that really is tempered doesn't just melt away uh it doesn't lose its temper uh a piece of metal uh can be hardened to a place and they have different levels of hardening uh probably should let brother Pat give this lesson more than me being the mechanic that he SP his whole life but um there's temp there's different levels of temperance even of metals you got really soft Metals you got aluminums and stuff like that and things that are a lot softer some that you could Bend I mean uh it used to be before I completely quit soda uh I would I would drink a soda on the plane and then i' just take it twist it and crush it down with my hands it's that soft uh thin of course but soft and you know something that's not tempered as hard I couldn't do that with a piece of iron or something it's a metal that's really hardened like a like a metal IE beam of a building or something you go above these uh uh these ceiling tiles you see there's metal beams that go across those are hardened they are tempered to the point that it Tak something extremely extremely hot to try to to to cause that uh metal to lose its temper uh so you see so when we get to the place that by the Holy Spirit it we have it we we are tempered to the place that we we become uh I hate to say the word Harden but that's basically what it is uh you become so hardened that uh this this it doesn't really matter the heat can come uh the heat can be applied the tribulations can come the trials can hit you but you're so tempered that you don't just melt and lose your temper uh that's where the whole thing comes from uh to have Temperance is to be able to hold yourself now uh you could probably put a simple match to a an aluminum can and it would start to lose its disc lose its color or something but a metal ibeam or something that's really tempered hard that really is solid it won't it it takes something extreme it takes something really hot hot white hot to cause it to melt amen like smelters like they use have smelters like uh that men used to do with horseshoeing uh when they used to do horseshoes for their for their horses that' have to have those things so hard you couldn't have a a soft metal and see uh you got so many people that are like that uh you've got some people that are just to the place and and I don't mean so hard as to when I say that I don't mean to be unfriendly uh I don't mean somebody because we use that word too to say well somebody's just hard that just means they're kind of unfriendly and brass and uh like the Crogan type they're just the hard just a hard guy it's hard to get along with that kind I don't mean that but someone who has gotten themselves tempered to by the Holy Spirit tempered to the place that the little trials the little tribulations the little struggles and things don't don't send them flying off the wheel it doesn't cause them to lose their temper it doesn't cause them to get upset and to get mad and to lose their temper and and and and and all that c but you've got different levels now some people uh usually more younger Christian uh that's less mature might fly off the handle of something that's just simple something that's not uh doesn't really mean a whole lot or when the Trials come or the tribulation hits or something like that you lose your patience and your temper and you fly off the handle say things you shouldn't and act in ways you shouldn't and uh present yourself to people in ways that you s you shouldn't and some people that you profess to be a Christian to look at you and say well that person says they're a Christian and look how they're acting see right amen but someone who is Harden someone who has that Temperance that doesn't lose their self-control just at the fly of a uh F FL to handle that easy just uh something simple they are tempered they they've been tempered they've been hardened they've been they've been brought to the place that they uh uh that that that they can stand the test you amen that they can stand the test and not just melt or lose their temper Temperance is also uh sober to be sober to be a person that's sober now sober is of course A lot of times if you say the word sober in today's society you're talking about someone that's just not been drinking alcohol uh that's usually the way it is but sober in the scripture doesn't refer to that sober in the scripture just basically means levelheaded uh someone who is moderate someone who is not they don't fly off the handle either way see so in the scripture when it talks about someone being sober it talks about the women being sober it means that there to be uh someone that's able to teach and to be levelheaded and and to have uh their uh their faculties in in in hand that that their emotions don't get the best of them they're they're sober and in the world it you know it's something totally different but Temperance to be uh uh to be self-controlled now I have a scripture a couple scriptures I want to read amen the first I have that I have printed out here and then I have another we will go to in the scripture but the first one I want to read is Romans chapter 12 Romans chapter 12 to talk about this amen praise the Lord amen Romans 12 verse4 look at this now the these two are some very uh exuse me but sobering scriptures uh they're the these next two scriptures I'm going to read are scriptures that probably are as much that great against the flesh is any Scripture that we have amen that war against our flesh as much as any Scripture let's read Romans 12:14 bless them which persecute you now that's not human that's not human you you don't pray for people that persecute you people don't normally do people don't normally bless or help those that persecute you and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one one toward another mind not high things but uh condescend to Men of lowest State be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evils so when someone's Reckoning evil to you you don't return evil to that person right amen you don't return evil for evil that's not the way of the Lord that's not the way of Christ provide things honest in the sight of all men when people see this what do they think about amen especially if you're a professing Christian which we all are professing Christians and people look at you you know as well as I do when you're a professing Christian you're under under a microscope 24/7 yes amen no matter where you are or who you're with even your family your spouse your co-workers uh the wherever people that know you you're professing Christian you're under a microscope amen so that's why I said we live this way because we live the to exude Christ in Our Lives who lived this life before us as an example 18th verse now if it be possible as much as lith in you live peaceably with all men that that's kind of given as much levity as you could get I guess if it's possible and as much as you possibly can right live peaceably with all men amen one that's maybe a little tempered might be able to a little easier someone who's not quite as tempered or temperate wouldn't be able to do that they would get FL the handle get angry mad dearly 19th verse dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give Place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine saith Newton Bennett oh no wait a minute did I miss that I got that wrong didn't I vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord right amen so it's not my place to execute evil for evil right to execute judgment on someone who's done me wrong bless those that persecute you amen Vengeance Belongs to the Lord it does not belong to Us Praise the Lord that's a hard one to understand uh maybe a hard one to give in because it greats against the flesh but that's the scripture Vengeance belongs to God doesn't belong to us amen there's going to be um I I was I'm I'm I'm trying to Lord he brought this to my attention for some reason I hadn't thought of this in years but I had a brother one time I'm trying to help me Lord to say this without getting detailed or anything I had a brother one time uh did something and I went to that brother and I said you ought not have done that and he gave some excuse later on he called me and he said and he apologized to me I said you don't no apologize to me what he did wasn't against me I was just there when he did it I saw him do it and but he apologized to me and he said uh you know uh please don't tell some and so or please don't do this or do this whatever you know to try to R things up or uh to try to get him in trouble if you will and and I said brother I said if there's any correction or if there's any judgment or if there's any uh light or anything that needs to be done God's going to do it not me amen I I don't do that I I don't go it's been done to me a lot over and over again but I don't do that I I don't believe any Christian should do that uh I hope I try uh I'm not saying I've never done it I try to hold my tongue and say that that is if and I I literally told the brother I said if there's anything if there's any correction needs to be done God's going to do it not me right that's up to him not me amen and of course I I I never did I never did say anything but um I don't know whatever happened or come I have no idea but that's between him and God it's not involved me I just happen to be there and saw what happened but you understand it's not our job it's not my position to to execute that judgment on that person it's not my job to go tattletail about this person and to try to make them look bad in front of somebody or something like that that's that's I don't want to do that I first I don't want to do that and first it's not my position to do that I I don't it's not it's not in my heart I'm not saying I've never done it but it's not in my heart to try to make someone look bad in front of someone else right it just it's just not me I just don't like doing that I don't like it done to me and it's been done many times um but I don't like it done to me I don't I try not to do it to anybody else and a lot of times I try to follow that life principle uh if I don't want it done to me then I try not to do it to anybody else seems like the world's really gotten away from that even in even in Christian realm but it's still a a founding principle I think everyone of us should be able to follow amen uh to be able to hold our tongue see the temperance would do that don't tongue to not try to exact Vengeance on somebody that's job that's God's job God there's not anything that goes on that God doesn't know about there's nothing said there's nothing thought there's nothing done that God doesn't know about so he knows about it if it needs to be done then he'll do it right amen let him do it not me that's up that's God's choice now people say well maybe God's going to use you to do it well he's gonna have to really come and give me a Stern talking to uh for me to do that because I don't I just don't do I don't think it should be done person amen other ways that God can do God God gives men gifts and visions and prophecies and there's all kinds of ways that that that can be known without me going and tattletail on something but it's not that that's not our position amen Vengeance doesn't belong to us Vengeance Belongs to the Lord let him execute it amen I will repay sayth the Lord 20th verse now therefore if thine enemy hung hunger feed him amen he's got a flat to on the side of the road don't BL past him and say it serves him right amen don't Flow by him with a flat tire say well that serves him right you know he's he's not what he says he is you know all kind of excuses no no no uhuh that's not that's not what we do therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him feed him help him be there for him amen I might not be a a a person that I may have given opportunity uh uh to to be friends with or to be there for them or whatever um uh and continually get well I guess for lack of better phraseology stabbed in the back um or unedifying there's just some people uh that I find that are unedifying to me and no matter usually when I'm around them or try to be friends or something like that it just comes around to the place that that person drags me down spiritually I'm not going to hang around with that person right I'm not going to be best friends with that person am uh if that person said something about me or done something or whatever that's that's between them and the Lord right uh but if they need help I'll be there to help them they need to be prayed for something I I'd be I'll absolutely do anything I could to be there for them but I'm not going to be their bus buy been down that road and it's not been helpful right is not been edifying and God God always wants us to help others uh but not to the detriment of yourself right amen we're not supposed to give to the point that becomes a detriment to us yes amen that's when when we start falling spiritually then and and it becomes unedifying that's when you got to re-evaluate and say this is just not working that's right and there's people in my life through my life my Christian life that I've had to I guess for back lack of better word cut off uh and just not really be friends with anymore because they're just not edifying of my life they're not helpful they're not beneficial and uh it's not but again to help them would do anything to in the world to help them right Amen to be there for them and that's what the scripture says if he's hungry feed him if he thirst give him drink for in doing so Thou shalt heat uh coals of fire on his head what that just shows who's the person in the wrong and you don't do do it for that purpose amen but that's that's the scripture that's how it comes be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good amen that's how we overcome evil with good right it's the best way to be able to overcome evil is with good now got another scripture I want to read about this and that all goes in line of course with being temperate being able able to be kind to someone that is mean to you being able to speak softly or uh to to squel wrath whenever uh someone brings wrath at you you you you stop it an answer answer kindly when you're spoken horribly to amen yes uh sometimes you may have to turn around and walk away and just not even be a part of the conversation but it all comes down to having uh being tempered and understanding that those names don't bother you that tribulation uh doesn't bother you that trial uh is like the proverbial water on the Ducks back uh you stay strong and solid and steady and firm you don't melt you don't lose your temper amen you stay firm and solid that that's the that's the attribute of the Holy Spirit just think of the things that Jesus how many examples would we have read of scripture this morning of Jesus when he went through those things right wanting to Stone him and calling him all kind and the only thing that Jesus came to do was to help people only reason he was here is to be good and to give and to heal and to be a blessing and to and to speak to people to help them come along and to and and to enhance their lives and and and their life beyond this life that's all he ever came for and all people did a lot of people is just hated him and spit on him and laughed at him and threw rocks at him and how many t two or three times in the scripture Jesus had to just simply disappear and go to another place so they couldn't even find him because they were going to kill him right amen so if if he was to that place and it was him that did that then what does that speak to us the Holy Spirit living in US amen how we should act now let's go over to Matthew Chapter 5 Lord help us let these things present themselves uh manifest themselves out of our Lives let these attributes be a part of our life everything from the faith virtue knowledge Temperance Amen to be able to those attributes live through us let us be able to say that we are the providers of these attributes Amen to its completeness to their fullness to their perfection amen amen praise the Lord because it's it's easy to it's a lot easier to have Temperance with someone that you're friends with or someone that you love or someone you're close to than it is maybe a total stranger or someone that pretends to be it really isn't it's easier to lose your hand lose your temper in a situation like that amen but um every one of us have our have those triggers that we try to keep protected amen again like we said that that the devil knows those the devil knows those places we got to keep them covered Matthew Chapter 5 now let's uh let's just start with verse 43 Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it hath been said now I'd like to know who said it but the scripture doesn't say but it hath been said Jesus said these are the words of Jesus of course Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy now I've heard that Jesus said you have heard amen and I know I have heard it I heard that growing up when I was a kid before I became a Christian I was B it was basically taught to me not in a school or but just what I learned by watching other people's actions that I was to uh Love My Enemy uh love my neighbor but hate my enemy right that's what I was always in the world and that's what the world teach teaches you amen the world basically teaches you love your neighbor or love those you're friends with buddies whatever and hate your enemies amen so we have permission to hate our enemies well no we don't but I say unto you Jesus said love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now that's hard I mean friend that that's not something that the normal human produces on a daily basis it just doesn't happen this is something that comes out from a Christian a holy ghost filled Christian is someone that is able to love their enemies literally love them amen and bless them that curse you pray for them do good to them that hate you they hate you but do good to them amen what did we just read it's like heaping up coals on their head right amen pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you right it's the best way amen that people realize who you are who you belong to unfortunately now there are people that know that about Christians and they take advantage of it amen again those are the people they take advantage of that in that situation that's not somebody you want to make your best buddy on a daily basis kind of thing amen that's the kind of person that's not that is unedifying amen and there are people there are countries that have sort of taking advantage of that even for the United States right being a Christian Nation which uh I would like to believe still is of the United States although it's teetering very seriously right now uh uh a Christian Nation that others have taken advantage of that oh well there the Jesus said if they Smite you the cheek to turn the other cheek well let's just Smite them there and when they turn the cheek we'll Smite them there and I've heard people say that amen well they turn the cheek to me and I'll just hit the other one okay but you know what wrath you're going to have to incur CU vengeance is not m amen I'm not going to sit here and beat you up or shoot you or the Vengeance belongs to God and trust me you probably would rather uh me do something than him do something when he does it it it it is far from Pleasant right uh but it's the it's the exhortation that Jesus gives to us love our enemies but I say now look what he said though now there's a reason for all this that ye may 45th verse that ye may be the children of your father this Pro this proves that you're a child of God which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and the unjust he absolutely does that's our God Amen so if he does that we should do that amen for if now but how look at here now for if if we love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same a worldly person does that a demonic person does that an evil person usually loves those that love them amen I mean there are some people in the world that probably don't like anybody or love anybody whether they love them or not they they'd rather kill you as to look at you there's probably some people like that but most people everybody they love those that love them oh they're they're my friends they love me but oh you come and make just something a little cross and that ends that amen well but Jesus says if all you do as a Christian is love those that love you what have you done amen I it's sort of like tithe giving uh the 10% is God's right when you tithe you give anything amen amen you give your 10% you had give anything cuz that is his to begin with you just give him back what was his amen well if you just love those that love you you haven't done anything everybody does that there's nothing unusual about that amen do not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father uh which is in heaven is perfect again that perfect which you said many times that same perfect it just means adult mature be a mature Christian uh don't be tossed about with every wind of Doctrine be be a mature Christian be a mature person be a grownup act like a grownup when you get older uh e even when you're even when you're getting into your pre-teens and teens uh I know my parents did to act your age you're getting older act act grown up you you want to be treated like an older person well then act like it right uh you're getting older act your age you ever heard that uh if you're a grownup act like a grownup be a grownup be mature amen then if you're mature all these little those little things are meaningless they don't mean anything to you you don't care that stuff doesn't R you up it doesn't get you mad or or or or or lose your temper amen you hold your temper CU as you get older you get hardened amen hopefully in the correct way you get Harden to all those things that just don't mean anything anymore someone calls you a name oh okay that's all right I don't I don't that's whatever doesn't bother me you know they can say whatever they want I Know Who I Am A lot of times the problem people have is they don't know who they are right if you don't know who you are when someone calls you a name you halfway believe it and you get mad about about it well if you know who you are you know what they're saying is not true then what does it bother you don't worry about it people can say anything that they want but you don't lose your temper over it you don't get mad fall off the handle uh uh uh speak bad about that person or go around behind their back and speak bad about them to somebody else no you keep you hold your tongue you hold your temper you pray to God you pray for them amen you pray for them and let God hand it if it needs to be handled that was the one thing in my conversation with the brother if it needs to be done God's going to do it I don't know if it needs to be done or not not my job not my position I don't know if that needs to be done or not but if it does God's going to do it not me right amen if if there's anything needs to be corrected over there let God do it not my position I don't even know if it does or not because that's that's in God's hands God's responsible for that not me amen I'm responsible to keep my temper and to keep my Temperance and to hold my tongue and to and to stay straight with the Lord and with my fellow man as best as I possibly can Amen to hold my temper or to be temperate amen the next is patience patience to be able to hold your tongue patience to be tolerable with other people amen so easy to lose your patience patience with God patience with each other uh patience is uh to endure patience is endurance uh steadfastness amen there's so many examples of patience in the scripture uh you've got Noah who waited uh 100 years you got uh uh Abraham waited 25 years you got the children of Israel waited 400 years and uh how many times that uh you you the patience to have to be able to have patience patience will pay off amen just hold fast and believe and have patience towards God have patience towards each other amen suffering suffering listen to this now suffering without getting angry or upset amen or staying temperate amen suffering now who wants to suffer no nobody wants to suffer right amen but that's what endurance to endure something or to endure suffering but stay patient amen and not get angry or upset that's part of the patience Falls in line of course with Temperance to be able to stay uh to be able to stay temperate now uh I got a couple scriptures I want to read patience obviously is probably one of the at least well maybe I'm just speaking for myself but one of the most difficult attributes I believe that there is to find patience if I ask in here how many people feel like you have patience I don't want anybody's hand to go up I don't know if anybody's hand would go up mine wouldn't uh they feel like you have patience sometimes we have patience patience breeds tolerance amen right yeah if you have patience patience will bring tolerance toward someone yes because a lot of times the things that we end up Los losing our losing our uh temper or something over or losing our patience about a lot of times isn't even what it was originally cracked up to be right or told to be or thought to be a lot of times it doesn't even manifest itself that way or materialize that way and we lost our patience for what amen a lot of people lose their patience with God so God you said you would do so and so God says I'm working on it amen how long did how long it Daniel had to be in the Lion's Den Daniel and the Lion's Den prayed to God Amen it was uh 21 days I think it was is that what the scripture 21 days the angel finally came to him and and stood there he said well what took your song he said well I was hindered amen but hold hold hold true he'll come and do it God will be there for you God is always your portion God is always there on time he's never late amen God is always just you sometimes you just have to be patient Lord I thought I was supposed to get a miracle well maybe not maybe you just going to be healed today amen and your healing today may take you a year right don't know that's up to God but we got to be patient amen yes hold our patience patience is a virtue that that brings Victory uh so many times we just could be patient it can bring Victory yes but so many times we're eager to jump in and and take over and and and and do something that gets us in trouble because you don't have the patience to wait for it wait for it amen it'll come just wait for it look patience I have a couple of scriptures I want to read James 1 one is the first one I want to start James 1 verse one this is a tough one also maturity will help your patience amen it should anyway yes it seems like in some ways it did help my mother very much my mom got very impatient when she got older uh well no I shouldn't say that when she got older she she was good but when after she had her stroke uh she got very impatient uh nothing was happening fast enough for her at that time uh going to a restaurant she' start fussing about her food I'm like Mom the lady just took the order five minutes ago I think it probably takes more than five minutes to cook the food unless you're roll it raw you know but she would just lose her patience my could tell you she's in the facility sometimes uh nobody comes to see him I said Mom I just talked to sister so and so and she was just there yesterday afternoon and you know yeah but it was after that point before that she was fine but usually maturity will help a person's patience me because when you're young you just want to go your mind is racing and you just want to go and you want to hurry you want to get it done you want to uh but when you get older and patient you get like brother Pat with this car you got to have patience with that car you're going to drive it off the cliff or or take it to the take it to the Smasher but you got to have patience amen and patience bring a Victory amen enough patience you'll be driving that car down the interstate James 1:1 James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brother count it all joy listen this now count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations or that's different manifold uh Temptations different types of Temptations divers is different types count it Joy when you fall into these Temptations be happy about it be joyous about it falling into this temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith now we're back on the building block again amen back down on the building block of Faith because the trying of your faith work patience work it oh I got to work at this oh yeah amen yeah I got to struggle I got to endure I got to suffer I don't want to work well you don't want to be a Christian then work that's what it means the trials of your the trying of your faith will work patience amen it doesn't just come it takes something it's a victory amen it's a victory that you have how many times have you flown off the handle or lost your temper or flown off the handle and blows something up it just falls apart messes up uh start over whatever I get like that at work sometimes uh I I just get to where I just want to hurry up and get it done now in some ways that's good because I work I get the job done I uh I don't just stand around I I I like to work I stood around a little bit when my brothers came the other day but that was because they were there and we were fellowshipping but I normally I uh well they can tell you when they walked on the lot I was working right uh I I work and but sometimes I get going so fast I make mistakes I shouldn't uh and I do things something just just stupid little things I could describe them to you but that that wouldn't necessarily help you know what I'm talking about things that just you get in a hurry and then you you mess them but when you get older so a lot of times you get older you get more patient you think okay uh this this would help if I took time to do this and make sure that it's done right amen because it's better to do it right the first time they have to do it two or three times yeah amen it even probably saves you time if you do it right the first time is that happen do it two or three different times or break it or make it to where it can't be fixed amen patience is a victory amen the trying of your faith Works patience amen so the trying of our faith what's the trying of our faith it's all the things that things happen in our lives that that brings us to the place are we going to believe it or are we going to doubt it are we going to have faith or are we not going to have faith do we trust God or we do we not trust God do we know he's going to come through or are we just not sure what faith trying our faith where is our faith then that helps us understand what place is my faith at what level is my faith at is my faith down here that really needs some encouraging and some work amen uh brother R talked about faith being muscles well if you want muscles you got to do what sit around on the couch all day no doesn't work that way if you want muscles you got to go in the gym or get some weights and work out you got to work you got to suffer you got to do something to cause muscle to be built that's the only way MUSC muscle is Built Well Faith muscles are the same way only way Faith muscle is going to be built is if it's exercised if it's tried if you go through something see that's how those thingss and those trials brings us to our kns it works that faith it brings that Faith to a place to where uh it gets stronger and stronger your faith increases and it gets stronger and your faith gets to the place to where nothing rattles you then amen your faith our faith should be at the place of born again Christian it shouldn't be anything that would rattle us or bring us down to tear us down amen our faith to where we just don't believe anymore which a lot of people unfortunately get to the place that their faith gets torn down because they don't they're not to the place to receive it their faith gets torn down to the place that they they it is it is unedifying at that point amen but the trial of our faith Works patience patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing again mature grown up patient got a couple more Romans chapter 5 I want to go over to Romans chapter 5 Romans chapter 5 the first five verses again things remember these things they there are some of the most the scriptures that great against the flesh the humanity the most amen love your enemies do good do good to them that hurt you pray for them that persecute you amen all manner of evil against you I'm supposed to love that person who does all manner of of evil against me well you got to remember they're not doing it against you they're doing against him and if they're doing against him then it's his position responsibility to exact Vengeance not mine amen because who I am is who he is I'm living my life for him not for me my life is not my own right I don't live my life I live my life for him amen my life belongs to him amen and if someone is is ridiculing that making fun of that or whatever that's that's they're ridiculing him yes Amen brother the scripture says when they're persecuting you they're not persecuting you they're persecuting me yes amen and when they're doing that it's his it's it's his place then to exact Vengeance not ours Romans 51 therefore you ready it's going to Great some more therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen by whom also we have access by Faith by faith in into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory amen now what did James just say with joy amen with joy now Romans Paul is saying we Glory in tribulations Glory or have joy in tribulations glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh there's that working again Works patience amen patience comes I remember when I was a young Christian remember when I was a young Minister I always felt like just speaking over and God it was just going to Happ happened just instantaneously Miracles abounding everywhere everything that happened everything you touched everything you prayed for it was going to be instantaneous God said uh lay hands and they shall recover he didn't say when right you see I was young then didn't think about that didn't think about the fact that healing is a process of time Miracle can happen amen something miraculous healing takes a per of time oh yeah do things happen instantaneously yes they do right amen but those are are a lot further apart than the healings that God performs right amen and when I was but when I was young I didn't differentiate differentiate those things and so many times I lose patience amen so many times I lose patience say God where are you a lot of people do that they cry where God why why where are you and see that proverbial why comes all the time when it should have no place in us even though there's some trials that come so hard I know when the Lord took our first son my whole cry I was still young of course young young human young Christian why God why why I know I heard my wife say why out loud so many ungodly demonic alcohol alcoholics drug Abus women have perfectly beautiful healthy babies and US Christian young Christians trying to start a family and God takes it home did not make a lick of sense but it's not for us to judge right it's not for us to understand and I don't understand although that's been quite the testimony her all through the years but God's the one that's in control of it not me amen glory Paul says to Glory GL that's hard to do there there's nothing about this that says this is going to be easy for you and there's really nothing about being a Christian that is easy right amen God never promis us a a b of roses amen this is not easy it's a it's a hard difficult wall but he said he'd be with me and when you get mature you realize that's all that really matters is that he's with me that's what matters prise the Lord amen tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope amen experience what is that maturity growing up amen being mature Christian now let's go to Romans chapter 8 we'll probably stop with this Romans chapter 8 very very familiar scripture read and of course friends so much of this is mostly getting highlights that uh there's so much more of this that can be said amen uh I one time uh I one time ask somebody if they prayed for patience I had found very few people that actually have confided in me or asked or or answered the question of whether they prayed for patience I don't know about you but I've had very few people tell me they pray for patience in fact I don't know if I've ever had anybody tell me that they pray for patience you know when you're praying for patience you're praying for tribulations amen because the tribulation is what works the patience yeah I know and I anybody say I don't pray I don't pray for patience cuz that just brings tribulation that just brings trials as for patience but how are you going to get it any other way right amen still have to get it Mike used to one of his we had a tape we used to play when when when cassettes existed um that was like Christian song and oh man he he is like uh uh a little bunny rabbit hopping all over the living room every time we would play this song he loved that song this sound like a uh it was like a rabbit or something he's singing uh patience patience I want patience give me patience right now I want patience I need patience give it to me now patience doesn't come that way amen that was the point of the song Romans 8 uh let's go to verse 2 6 Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought now listen to this really close this is a a very uh tremendous scripture the spirit helpeth our infirmities our shortcomings sicknesses for we know not what we should pray we don't even know what what we should pray we always get down thinking when we believe we know what we should pray we don't know what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered amen a lot of people believe that's tongue speaking I believe it could be uh I believe it's also just the spirit of God praying through you it doesn't have to be something that's unknown right uh to the human ear it could be something that the Lord is just praying through you that you you don't even realize may not even know the person or the situation but it's the spirit of God using you to pray to audibly bring prayer on someone else's behalf because we don't know but he does yes and he that searcheth the hearts listen to this now he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit this would have been maybe a good lesson good scripture with the talking about the mind uh the Gateway but he that searcheth the hearts know knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because because he maketh he because he knows this because he maketh intercession for the Saints he maketh intercession for us amen amen now this is where the Catholic well one of the hundreds of thousands of places of Catholic church is wrong it doesn't say the Saints are making intercession it says that he is making intercession on behalf of the Saints right right the Saints aren't making intercession Christ is making intercession for the Saints amen again one of the many many things they got wrong I probably threw out a number I probably shouldn't but many many things they got they get wrong it's not the Saints making intercession it's Christ making intercession for the Saints he does it because he knows what is the mind of the spirit and the best part it is according to the will of God not your will amen not our will that's why we have to have patience it's not our will amen that's some of the hard part amen cuz we want it a certain way certain time a certain uh person however it works we want it we in our mind so many of the times we have it set our mind going to be like this and how this and this is when it's going to be and all and we get it all set and God's up there thinking that's not at all how it's going to happen that's not at all who but we get in our mind but see it's not up to us it's not up to our will right amen amen and we do pray a specific way scripturally and there's nothing wrong with with that but we when we get into that place of intercession of the Holy Spirit to pray through us and to speak through us and Christ that knows the heart the mind of the spirit and can make intercession on our behalf the intercession that he makes on our behalf is not according to what I want it's according to God's will amen God's perfect will amen now follow that up with the 28th verse and now we know praise the Lord now we know now is we we talked about him that searcheth the heart and him that knows and him that makes intercession and him that goes the perfect will of God but now we know we know praise the Lord right I know that we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God amen amen to them that love God and that love is ago iil God's love amen amen not human love not filio love not an affinity not an affection amen but love to those that love God if you love God you trust him if if you trust God you have faith in him if you have faith in him you believe then you know not just believe but you know that everything that God's going to do for you is going to be for your good yes amen because he maketh intercession on our behalf to his perfect will so we know based on that that all things work together for my good because I love it I love him H now people that just have an affinity for God or an affection or yeah he's good he's good God he's you know whatever brother R talked about back in the day calling Daddyo and stuff and whatever right that's kind of disrespectful I'm sure other people would do uh not like brother BR was just talking about it but the way they would do that uh yeah but then when when the trial comes and when the tribulation and when the difficulty set in that love that Faith just evaporates and I said well why would God do such a and then they go off you know you thought they were a Christian you thought they were a solid Christian you thought they were a Believer and the next thing you know they're out of here amen just because of X Y and Z you think what maturity is there in that amen what faith is there in that that right amen for this scripture to work for you you have to love God with God's Own Love Not Your Love Not Human love but you have to love God with God's Own love yes and if you love God with God's Own love that love is unconditional right conditions don't dictate it amen which I guess we're jumping way up to the Capstone now but it conditions have no no effect on your love for God yes amen you can be in a ditch somewhere you can be on the highest mountain you can be in a shanty cardboard box you can be in aund room Mansion you could be driving a quar million dollar car or a $200 galopy conditions don't change your love for God period doesn't matter you can be sick dying with cancer leukemia whatever you're can to be the most healthy person on the planet I have come to find out that sometimes s the healthiest person on the planet has died before the person that was sick amen I've seen a lot of people uh I'm not saying don't do it but just health health health health health and what they do and what they eat everything and then they're dead at 50 yes now I'm not saying I'm not making fun of that and I'm not saying we shouldn't be healthy uh but we do what we do according to God 's perfect will not mine amen and the conditions have nothing to do with my love to God nothing amen okay then all things now then we know work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose his perfect will that's what we know amen that's what we know now we have to understand in patience that all things it just doesn't say the thing all things work together it's not just one thing you pull down and Bam there it is no all things work together they have to dovetail they have to all come together to work together for our good amen now that that sometimes takes patience amen I I I know in listening to brother Brown I'm closing here that he would talk about Vision sometime and when he saw Vision he'd see a vision exactly a certain way now some people might use the word Deja Vu or something it's not as clear as maybe a v actual Vision but he'd see this vision and all of a sudden he would be in this position this place where this Vision was coming into fruition and he's sitting there and he sees this vision and he remembers he's in he's he's in that Vision if you will but brother brandom himself can't do anything about it see because the conditions had to bring themselves all together now brother random could go in there and say in Jesus name you are healed wasn't going to happen amen not even for brother Brown wasn't going to happen he could not go over and change the circumstances he could not go change things to make it fit what his vision was it had to be God doing it in God's time brother B just had to sit there and be patient and wait May took hours May took days whatever the circumstances the situation the specific situation he could not do it God had to be the one to do it because it's in God's time not ours right amen that's where we have to be patient yes it's not in my time it's in God's time it's not according to what I want it's according to what he's already done we by faith believe that it's going to work together for our good amen but so many times more often than not we have to be patient we have to wait for it amen it will come God will God does o God will fulfill his word he always always does amen God cannot ever not fulfill his word because he is his word amen God can no more deny his word than deny himself right amen it will work we just have to have patience and the temperance the temperance I've heard I've seen so many people too they get furious with God because they lose their patience they're mad at God amen because they've lost their patience they didn't really have it to start with amen I have to have the Holy Spirit brings all the attributes in to that place of of completeness in US Amen to work together it's lessons that every one of us should be able to continue to learn and live amen as God shows it to us and it lived through us not just something we preach not just something we listen to not just something that we hear and say well okay I get that I know that I understand you know it's a place that we uh that we live that we should live all of us should live amen when something doesn't go exactly the way we want it to maybe there's a reason for that that's right one more thing before I close I read the other day it was plane crash in Brazil 68 people died something like that I saw the video that unreal the plane was just going along and all of a sudden it just went it just just fell right straight into the ground I mean I've seen I've seen you know sometimes they go down or dive or something or or even go like this this plane just went I had Twisted on its way down it just fell to the ground I'm thinking what happened to that plane it just fell straight down but I read the testimony two people were supposed to be on that flight and they got things all mixed up don't think this didn't speak to me Saints um firsthand something got mixed up reservations whatever they didn't make their flight and if they' made that flight they'd have been on that ill- fated plane praise the Lord that lost their lives their lives were spared because of a technicality uh snafu the type of snafus that get us so mad some times we can't hardly spit but God's working everything out God's taking care of us God is making sure that his perfect will is manifested in our lives even if it causes us some minor inconveniences amen and I tell like I said don't don't I can tell you right now that spoke to me amen especially sometimes we had this situation that challenge us with flight sometimes or I have to drive the fence or something I'm starting to more and more slowly get to the place that Lord I don't care right whatever I well I I need to get there it's my job try to get there as fast as I can work with uh the lady at work and stuff but you know if it doesn't happen doesn't happen if it's another plane it's another plane another time another time another city another city I don't care I'm I'm not going to worry about it um God has taking care of us amen praise the Lord so those little snappo that get us mad sometimes there's probably a good reason for it we just need to be patient say the Lord's working something here amen I just want to be patient praise the Lord and be patient with one another it's sort of like that testimony sister MTI sent last week at that lady with her husband she realized after a little bit that God was doing something God's working here I just need to be patient and back off a little bit and and just be what I'm supposed to be as a Christian woman and let God do the rest and he did amen he did and the and the result was positive amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could God works all things together for our good amen because we love him because we love him praise the Lord not because we just think he's a good guy not c not and not even because he's been good to us amen I don't love God because he love I just well the Bible says I love him because he first loved me but because there was no way I could love him without that but I if God never did one more thing for us in life at all period ever again he's done way more bunches and bunches more than I ever deserve to start with so uh who am I to complain amen praise the Lord 493 let's sing this CH I want to live the way he wants me to live Mich want put it on here I want to we probably all know it anyway I want to live the way he wants me to live that's being a mature Christian that's being a grownup amen that's letting God take over and live through us praise the Lord become one of his who he wants us to be amen who he wants us to be amen God is so good isn't [Music] he let's sing it to him now sing it with your heart though you mean it I want to live the way he wants me to live I want on to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love oh I could never ever out love my Lord I Want To Live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love oh I could never ever out love my Lord let's sing it this way once now I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love to there's just no more love oh I could never ever out love my Lord amen praise the Lord Jesus that's our resolution that's our determination I am going to live the way he wants me to live the way he wants me to live is to enter into each in a per way of these attributes in our lives amen that's the way he wants us to live praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus he is he is our portion he is our righteousness he is everything to us like I said the only way we could do it can't do it
