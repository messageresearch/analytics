[42:59] god bless you today we have a a couple
[43:02] prayer requests i have here
[43:03] uh one i believe this one's sister lydia
[43:06] uh
[43:06] prayer request asking prayer for niece's
[43:09] son zach
[43:10] uh we'll be under undergoing back
[43:12] surgery this morning
[43:13] or this monday excuse me is that correct
[43:15] sister
[43:16] that's okay so her niece's son zach so
[43:19] let's remember that in prayer
[43:21] uh undergoing back surgery on monday so
[43:24] please remember him in prayer if you
[43:25] would
[43:26] i also got a request from sister norma
[43:28] although she's sitting here she could
[43:30] help me out maybe with this but uh it
[43:32] says all um
[43:35] it says also remember but it's the only
[43:37] thing i have here so i'm not sure
[43:40] um yeah yeah i think it went to micah
[43:43] and then it went to zach and then he
[43:44] said it to me
[43:47] so um it's from my daughter you go ahead
[43:50] and speak it now
[43:50] if anyone doesn't hear y'all clarify it
[43:52] okay from a daughter
[43:54] kathy the young man that
[43:57] she's raising his
[44:01] cousin committed suicide um
[44:04] friday night so he's a teenager
[44:08] just remember the family and burgess
[44:11] uh seems like that family has been
[44:13] abusing the children
[44:15] and also katrina's good friend renee
[44:20] uh her brother passed away
[44:24] um not her brother i'm sorry her cousin
[44:29] uh he drank himself to death
[44:31] unfortunately okay yeah that's the one i
[44:33] have here
[44:34] katrina's friend renee's family yeah
[44:37] cousin
[44:38] finally succumbed to alcoholism he's 40
[44:40] in his 40s
[44:42] very young said he lost his family
[44:46] to a divorce and drank himself to death
[44:48] basically within two years is that
[44:50] correct
[44:50] that's right okay that's what we had
[44:52] here so
[44:54] amen anything else on that then amen
[44:58] so let's please remember that in prayer
[44:59] of course if you didn't get all that of
[45:01] course
[45:02] the lord did and that's the main part uh
[45:04] he said we ask
[45:06] you know it's one of those anomalies
[45:08] that you see in the scripture
[45:10] kind of a paradox because we know that
[45:12] god knows everything
[45:14] even from before it ever happened but he
[45:16] still
[45:17] wants us to ask him amen so that's what
[45:20] we do
[45:21] not that he's not mindful not that he
[45:22] doesn't already know but he still asks
[45:24] us to ask it's a
[45:26] it's an expression of faith we're asking
[45:28] lord because we believe that you answer
[45:30] our prayer amen amen
[45:33] not to mention the fact that it puts it
[45:36] puts a stamp on it
[45:37] you know it puts it say i asked the lord
[45:39] for this and god blessed me with it
[45:42] amen it's a stake it's a finality it's
[45:45] something you have faith in and believe
[45:47] amen it's absolute so anyone else have a
[45:49] prayer request today
[45:51] yes brother dennis yes uh remember
[45:55] my wife will have her surgery this
[45:58] friday
[45:59] very early and um
[46:02] and she's very nervous right now the
[46:05] lord will just touch you
[46:07] now amen please praise the lord just
[46:10] remember sister leah in prayer
[46:11] and would you want to clarify to the
[46:13] congregation exactly what it is she's
[46:15] going into surgery for
[46:17] sure um back in 2000
[46:21] she had breast cancer on the right side
[46:26] and they not only put it through chemo
[46:29] but they also put it through
[46:30] uh radiation and now that she's having
[46:34] discomfort for a little while over 20
[46:38] years
[46:38] and they're going to see if they can um
[46:41] help her
[46:42] with the discomfort yeah with the
[46:44] surgery this friday
[46:46] okay amen so let's please remember leah
[46:49] in prayer if you would
[46:50] anyone else have a prayer request
[46:53] um for my mom she is having some
[46:57] health issues with her stomach and they
[47:00] want to do like
[47:02] um stick tubes down her throat and stuff
[47:04] she's just decided she doesn't want to
[47:08] she's uh
[47:12] the good thing about everything that's
[47:14] been going on is the lord spoken to her
[47:17] recently
[47:18] about um just everything that's happened
[47:21] in my sister passing
[47:23] and my mom said that she's just uh she's
[47:26] not wanting to go but she says that
[47:28] she's
[47:29] at peace finally realizing that it's a
[47:31] beautiful thing
[47:33] and um so she's she's doing better than
[47:36] that but she doesn't want to
[47:38] doctors to start sticking things into so
[47:41] she's just having
[47:42] stomach issues we don't know they don't
[47:44] know what's wrong with her
[47:45] so she's just keeping prayer also from
[47:48] my
[47:49] father-in-law he's going through the
[47:51] same thing they don't know what's wrong
[47:52] with his stomach
[47:54] um and he is doing all the
[47:58] things that with the the tubing
[48:00] everything and they still can't find out
[48:01] what
[48:02] exactly is the problem so that's got him
[48:05] in my um
[48:07] his spirits down oh he mentioned to me
[48:10] he feels like the lord is not listening
[48:12] to him
[48:13] and that he's abandoned him i know
[48:16] that's the lie of the devil
[48:18] and amen he's just very uh
[48:21] um down up in his spirits
[48:24] wanting to hear from the lord just
[48:26] praying that the lord speaks to him and
[48:27] he has them
[48:28] amen to remember those requests and
[48:32] prayer too
[48:33] also remember uh got a couple more also
[48:35] remember

[48:38] to the doctor this week
[48:39] and she's had a lot of a lot of pain in
[48:42] her
[48:43] abdomen area and uh it's been very
[48:47] discomforting to her and and really

[1:10:11] 19.
[1:10:13] so he departed fence and found elisha
[1:10:15] the son of seraphat who was plowing with
[1:10:17] twelve oak
[1:10:18] yoke of oxen before him and he was with
[1:10:21] the twelfth and elijah passed by him and
[1:10:23] cast his mantle upon him
[1:10:25] he left the oxen ran after elijah and
[1:10:28] said let me i pray thee kiss my
[1:10:30] father and my mother then will i follow
[1:10:32] thee and he said unto him go back again
[1:10:34] for what have i done unto thee and he
[1:10:37] returned back from him
[1:10:39] and took a yoke of oxen slew them and
[1:10:41] boiled their flesh the instruments of
[1:10:43] the oxen
[1:10:44] and gave unto the people they did eat
[1:10:46] then he arose and went after elijah
[1:10:49] ministered unto him amen you can be
[1:10:51] seated if you'd like
[1:10:54] amen we want to continue on the thought
[1:10:57] today of the fitted garment
[1:10:59] this would be the fitted garment part 2
[1:11:02] as we got into last week
[1:11:03] the the mantle that was thrown down from
[1:11:05] elijah to elisha
[1:11:07] the invitation that that that god had
[1:11:10] told elijah to do
[1:11:11] that he went and found elisha and he
[1:11:13] threw that that
[1:11:14] garment he threw that mantle on elijah
[1:11:17] and that was
[1:11:18] merely an invitation but of course
[1:11:20] elisha knew the significance of it and
[1:11:22] what it meant to him
[1:11:24] but that garment was a very specific
[1:11:26] garment because it was a prophet's
[1:11:28] garment
[1:11:28] it was a garment that had a
[1:11:30] signification and had a meaning to it
[1:11:32] just like we know that we know that the
[1:11:34] bride today is
[1:11:36] robed in his righteousness that garment
[1:11:38] is a very specific
[1:11:40] garment and it's not just for everybody
[1:11:42] but it's only in tune to fit those that
[1:11:45] will fit that garment
[1:11:46] and elisha was the one that was that god
[1:11:49] had called to try to fit that garment
[1:11:51] and and we know that that was the call
[1:11:53] that god had given to him
[1:11:55] uh but there had to be something that he
[1:11:57] went through there had to be a
[1:11:59] a process that elisha had to go through
[1:12:02] to be able to fit that garment
[1:12:03] because there had to be a uh there had
[1:12:06] to be a life that was lived there had to
[1:12:08] be a purpose that was given there had to
[1:12:10] be a
[1:12:11] focus that elisha had to know who he was
[1:12:14] to be able to step into that friend you
[1:12:16] can't just say that
[1:12:17] you know brother branham come up to me
[1:12:19] and said okay son you are called to fill
[1:12:22] my shoes when i go and you say oh
[1:12:23] wonderful let's just get to it
[1:12:25] doesn't happen that way not that it was
[1:12:28] not that that was the situation with
[1:12:30] anybody
[1:12:30] i'm just typing that of course to elijah
[1:12:33] and elisha
[1:12:34] because that's basically what elijah did
[1:12:36] he went up to elisha through the mantle
[1:12:37] on him and basically saying that
[1:12:39] uh a son this is you this is this is the
[1:12:42] footsteps you're supposed to walk in and
[1:12:44] you're the one that's supposed to take
[1:12:45] my place when i'm taken out of here
[1:12:47] well he said well praise the lord that's
[1:12:48] wonderful let's just get to it no that
[1:12:50] wasn't
[1:12:50] elisha had to go through some training
[1:12:52] elisha had to go through some growing
[1:12:54] elisha had to go through some
[1:12:57] some molding and some shaping to be able
[1:12:59] to fit that garment
[1:13:00] because it's like we said last week the
[1:13:03] garment is not
[1:13:04] made for uh to be shaped for us
[1:13:07] we are supposed to be shaped to fit that
[1:13:10] garment
[1:13:10] and just like the elisha had to be
[1:13:12] shaped to fit that garment
[1:13:14] the bride in this last day has to be
[1:13:16] shaped and molded
[1:13:18] to be able to fit the garments bright
[1:13:20] the bride's garment that's the only way
[1:13:22] that she can get into it
[1:13:24] is because she has to be molded into
[1:13:26] that garment
[1:13:27] not that garment molded everybody wants
[1:13:29] to change god everybody wants to change
[1:13:32] the word
[1:13:33] everybody wants it to be according to
[1:13:34] the way they think it should be here
[1:13:36] some seminary or some church or some
[1:13:38] pastor but it can't be molded that way
[1:13:41] friend
[1:13:41] god will not uh conform to your religion
[1:13:46] or your idea of who you think he is
[1:13:49] god doesn't do that he doesn't conform
[1:13:52] himself into any denomination
[1:13:54] god's not going to conform himself into
[1:13:56] a message denomination
[1:13:57] god's not going to conform himself into
[1:13:59] what your idea of him is
[1:14:01] god is only who he is by his word
[1:14:04] and the only way we can get into him is
[1:14:07] for us to be conformed
[1:14:09] is for us to be molded the only way
[1:14:11] elijah could fit that garment
[1:14:13] is he had to be molded to fit that
[1:14:15] garment now look what brother branham
[1:14:17] said about this
[1:14:18] in the second hand robe 1956 november
[1:14:21] he said now notice elijah after he threw
[1:14:24] his robe on him now remember
[1:14:26] that robe was an invitation that's all
[1:14:29] it was
[1:14:31] now elisha was a free moral agent
[1:14:34] and uh i i've really kind of been on my
[1:14:36] heart on free moral agency lately but
[1:14:38] we're not gonna preach on it today but
[1:14:40] just this little part of it elijah was
[1:14:42] still a free moral agent just like every
[1:14:44] human ever born
[1:14:45] was born on free moral agency they were
[1:14:48] born
[1:14:49] born with choice they had a decision to
[1:14:52] make
[1:14:52] just because elijah threw the mantle
[1:14:55] down on elisha
[1:14:56] did not mean that that settled it elisha
[1:14:59] still had to make the decision
[1:15:01] of what he was going to do with that
[1:15:03] mantle what am i going to do
[1:15:06] with this invitation and see that's the
[1:15:08] invitation
[1:15:09] all of humanity gets every person ever
[1:15:12] born
[1:15:13] from adam and eve forward has given has
[1:15:16] been given an
[1:15:17] invitation to come to god and then later
[1:15:19] when christ came along to come to jesus
[1:15:22] christ
[1:15:22] and everybody today has that invitation
[1:15:25] if they want to come to jesus christ or
[1:15:27] not
[1:15:28] is simply an invitation and this mantle
[1:15:31] was thrown
[1:15:32] as an invitation and brother adam says
[1:15:35] now
[1:15:35] he threw that robe on him and he tried
[1:15:38] it on him he said in other words elijah
[1:15:40] the prophet who had the mantle of god on
[1:15:42] his shoulders
[1:15:43] came down and laid it across the line
[1:15:45] she's a farmer to see if it would fit
[1:15:47] him
[1:15:49] and it taken about 10 years that's
[1:15:51] brother brahms saying course
[1:15:52] scripturally referenced about 10 years
[1:15:55] to get altered to fit that mantle
[1:15:59] it took him about 10 years he's saying
[1:16:02] here
[1:16:02] for elisha to be molded to be able
[1:16:06] to fit that garment to fit that mantle
[1:16:08] you know god usually puts us
[1:16:11] in his shop and trims us up amen we know
[1:16:14] of course
[1:16:15] uh the the potter has power over the
[1:16:17] clay
[1:16:18] amen we know there's a whole the
[1:16:20] scripture reading in
[1:16:21] in romans 9 that tells us about how that
[1:16:24] he
[1:16:25] he's the potter and we are the clay and
[1:16:27] he molds us
[1:16:28] and he shapes us and that's what brother
[1:16:30] branham's talking about
[1:16:31] he said you know god usually puts us or
[1:16:34] shall i say
[1:16:35] always puts us in a shop and trims us
[1:16:39] up yes amen you just don't come out of
[1:16:41] the
[1:16:42] womb and and i'll just say that
[1:16:44] spiritually not physically
[1:16:46] but out of the spiritual womb and or
[1:16:49] you're bored again all of a sudden you
[1:16:50] just you know everything can do anything
[1:16:52] and all things are
[1:16:53] you know uh uh uh at your feet no
[1:16:56] there's there's
[1:16:57] training there's there's molding there's
[1:16:59] shaping and that's what brother graham's
[1:17:01] talking he wants
[1:17:02] he wants to trim us up he wants to make
[1:17:05] it to where we can fit that garment
[1:17:07] now there was a time uh back i i told
[1:17:10] y'all i think the other day i bought
[1:17:11] these suits like
[1:17:13] we were moving back from the mountains
[1:17:14] 2006 something like that
[1:17:16] five six seven something in that time
[1:17:18] frame so they're kind of old but
[1:17:20] you know after four five six years or so
[1:17:23] of wearing them
[1:17:24] um i i came to the
[1:17:27] part of life where i didn't fit them so
[1:17:30] well
[1:17:31] uh the garment didn't change garment was
[1:17:34] same size
[1:17:35] the one that changed was me and they got
[1:17:38] a little snug and they got a little
[1:17:40] tight and
[1:17:41] uh i went to his sister the tabernacle
[1:17:43] and well i actually talked to brother
[1:17:45] green about it because i was just going
[1:17:46] to get him altered he said oh no give
[1:17:47] him to sister
[1:17:48] uh i'll just tell you i i appreciate her
[1:17:51] she's a godly sister sister sarah codner
[1:17:53] a fantastic seamstress anyway and a
[1:17:56] precious sister but
[1:17:57] she she took them and and she
[1:18:00] she made them and took them out and got
[1:18:03] it to where i could fit into it again
[1:18:05] uh instead of me molding myself into the
[1:18:08] garment
[1:18:09] she took and altered the garment so the
[1:18:11] garment would still fit me
[1:18:12] and praise the lord i've got another six
[1:18:14] seven eight years whatever out of them
[1:18:16] to be able to wear them i'm about
[1:18:18] wearing them out now
[1:18:20] back during the beginning of the
[1:18:22] pandemic last year
[1:18:25] uh i probably ate a few more chips and
[1:18:28] drank a little too much soda and
[1:18:29] they started getting a little tight
[1:18:31] again and they didn't fit anymore so
[1:18:34] i looked at the back and i said well it
[1:18:36] looks like she took them out as far as
[1:18:38] they're gonna get taken out
[1:18:40] so there's got to be some shaping on
[1:18:42] this guy because these aren't going to
[1:18:44] be shaped anymore
[1:18:45] so there had to be something done to me
[1:18:47] so that i could still fit into them
[1:18:50] and about that time so i went to work
[1:18:52] with brother roger and swept my brains
[1:18:53] out every day and working hard out
[1:18:55] siding and sweating and sweating and
[1:18:57] sweating and working and working at work
[1:18:58] and all of a sudden i started putting
[1:18:59] them on i'm like wow these still fit
[1:19:01] these fit pretty good now again
[1:19:03] but see that time i had to be shaped to
[1:19:06] fit the garment
[1:19:07] even the garment could no longer be
[1:19:09] shaped in
[1:19:10] in this case the bride's garment it is
[1:19:13] it is
[1:19:14] perfectly in the shape of jesus christ
[1:19:17] we have to be trimmed up amen we have to
[1:19:20] be trimmed up whether it takes a little
[1:19:22] sweating it out
[1:19:23] whether it takes a little hard work
[1:19:25] whether it takes some extra time on your
[1:19:27] knees or a little time in prayer or
[1:19:29] reading your bible whatever it is
[1:19:31] to take some trimming to be able to fit
[1:19:33] into that bride garment
[1:19:35] to be able to fit into that word garment
[1:19:37] because it won't be altered
[1:19:39] because it's exactly the way it's
[1:19:41] supposed to be it's exactly
[1:19:43] perfect so we have to be molded to fit
[1:19:46] it
[1:19:46] the man said he likes to trim us up now
[1:19:49] see now look
[1:19:50] he didn't alter his robe to fit elisha
[1:19:54] amen he did not alter the robe the
[1:19:58] mantle to fit elisha
[1:19:59] he altered elisha to fit that mantle
[1:20:02] right
[1:20:03] amen and and and that's what he does
[1:20:06] today
[1:20:06] he alters us to fit the road not the
[1:20:09] robe to fit
[1:20:10] us we
[1:20:13] are shaped and molded into the word the
[1:20:16] word doesn't change to fit us
[1:20:18] the word's not gonna change to fit my
[1:20:21] lifestyle
[1:20:22] the words not gonna change to fit my
[1:20:24] idea or opinion
[1:20:25] or what the world thinks or what some
[1:20:27] denomination or seminary things or even
[1:20:29] some
[1:20:29] church no has to be me
[1:20:34] it has to be you yes we have to be the
[1:20:36] ones to change
[1:20:37] we have to be the ones that are molded
[1:20:39] sometimes we want to make the road fit
[1:20:41] us but we can't do that you've got to be
[1:20:45] altered you all to yourself to the robe
[1:20:49] it's god's robe and he made it perfect
[1:20:52] and he's got any uh he's got to bring us
[1:20:55] into that realm
[1:20:56] to make that robe fit us amen
[1:21:00] so that we fit in to that robe just like
[1:21:03] elisha was given that
[1:21:05] that chance now how did elisha this was
[1:21:08] a process we read this last week so if
[1:21:10] you want to turn over to second kings
[1:21:12] again
[1:21:13] uh you can turn over with me second
[1:21:15] kings chapter two
[1:21:16] i'm gonna read through this that we read
[1:21:18] last week but i'm not gonna
[1:21:20] take a lot of time and and expound on it
[1:21:22] like we did last week but just read
[1:21:24] through it again
[1:21:25] so second kings chapter two
[1:21:28] let's look at this again and let's see
[1:21:30] this process
[1:21:31] because i want to get something
[1:21:33] somewhere in the next 35 minutes 40
[1:21:35] minutes
[1:21:36] so uh so we can take something from this
[1:21:39] today
[1:21:39] trust it bless you now second kings
[1:21:42] chapter 2 verse 1
[1:21:44] and it came to pass when the lord would
[1:21:46] take up elijah into heaven by a
[1:21:48] whirlwind
[1:21:50] that elijah went with elisha from gilgal
[1:21:53] and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i
[1:21:56] pray thee
[1:21:57] now listen to the verbiage of this
[1:21:59] listen to the verbiage of how
[1:22:02] the lord is amplifying this through
[1:22:04] elijah
[1:22:05] and what is being said okay and even
[1:22:07] just the verbiage in some of the words
[1:22:10] elijah said unto elisha tarry here i
[1:22:12] pray thee for the lord hath sent me to
[1:22:14] bethel
[1:22:15] and elijah said unto him as the lord
[1:22:17] liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not
[1:22:19] leave thee
[1:22:20] so they both went down to bethel
[1:22:22] remember justification
[1:22:25] bethel the signification a signal of
[1:22:29] justification and the sons of the
[1:22:31] prophets that were at bethel came to
[1:22:33] elisha and said unto him noah thou that
[1:22:35] the lord will make it
[1:22:36] uh will take thy master from thy head
[1:22:38] today and he said yea
[1:22:40] i know it hold your peace elijah said
[1:22:43] unto him elijah
[1:22:44] elijah said unto him elisha terry here i
[1:22:47] pray thee for the lord has sent me to
[1:22:49] jericho
[1:22:50] and he said as the lord liveth and as i
[1:22:52] soul liveth i will not leave thee
[1:22:54] so they came to jericho just uh
[1:22:57] sanctification
[1:22:58] amen bethel justification jericho
[1:23:01] sanctification
[1:23:02] the sons of the prophets that where
[1:23:04] jericho came to elisha and said unto him
[1:23:06] knowest thou
[1:23:08] knowest thou that the lord will take
[1:23:09] away thy master from my head today
[1:23:12] he answered yeah i know it hold your
[1:23:14] peace
[1:23:15] elisha said unto him terry i pray thee
[1:23:17] here for the lord has sent me to jordan
[1:23:20] and he said as the lord liveth and as
[1:23:21] thy soul liveth i will not leave thee
[1:23:23] and the two went on
[1:23:25] amen together now jordan represents
[1:23:28] death
[1:23:29] separation dying to yourself which is
[1:23:32] into the holy ghost jordan
[1:23:34] the holy ghost and 50 men of the sons of
[1:23:37] the prophets
[1:23:38] went and stood to view afar off and the
[1:23:41] two stood by jordan
[1:23:42] elijah took his mantle wrapped it
[1:23:44] together smote the waters and they were
[1:23:46] divided hither and thither so that they
[1:23:48] went over on dry ground and they came to
[1:23:50] pass when they were gone over that
[1:23:51] elijah said unto
[1:23:53] elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall
[1:23:56] do for thee
[1:23:57] before i be taken away from thee and
[1:23:59] elisha said i pray thee let a double
[1:24:02] portion of thy spirit be upon me
[1:24:04] and he said thou has asked a hard thing
[1:24:08] nevertheless if thou see me when i am
[1:24:10] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[1:24:13] but if not it shall not be so and it
[1:24:15] came to pass as they still went on and
[1:24:17] talked
[1:24:18] that behold there appeared a chariot of
[1:24:20] fire horses of fire parted them both
[1:24:22] uh asunder and elisha went up our world
[1:24:24] went into
[1:24:25] elijah whenever went into heaven elisha
[1:24:28] saw it cried my lord
[1:24:30] my father my father the chariot of
[1:24:32] israel the horsemen thereof
[1:24:34] and he saw him no more he took a hold of
[1:24:36] his own clothes and read them in two
[1:24:38] pieces
[1:24:39] he took up also the mantle of elijah
[1:24:41] that fell from him and went back
[1:24:43] and stood by the bank of the jordan and
[1:24:45] remember of course he took that
[1:24:47] he took that mantle and he struck that
[1:24:49] river jordan and said where is the god
[1:24:51] of elijah and the river did exactly as
[1:24:53] it did when elijah did it
[1:24:55] when elijah smote it it elijah
[1:24:58] it parted they walked on dry ground when
[1:25:01] elisha hit it
[1:25:02] it parted and they walked over on dry
[1:25:05] ground
[1:25:06] but what was it that he had to do elisha
[1:25:09] had to follow elijah he had to go with
[1:25:13] elijah he had to learn from elijah he
[1:25:15] had to be taught and he had to
[1:25:18] grow and he had to be molded and shaped
[1:25:21] and to be able to
[1:25:22] to fit into that to that mantle to fit
[1:25:25] into that place to fit into that
[1:25:27] position
[1:25:28] because the mantle was just a
[1:25:29] representation of who was wearing it
[1:25:32] you understand you're simply a
[1:25:34] representation
[1:25:36] of what is inside of you if the holy
[1:25:38] ghost is living in you and you are born
[1:25:40] again and you
[1:25:41] have the holy ghost you're simply your
[1:25:43] flesh is a representation
[1:25:45] of what is on the inside of you that
[1:25:48] mantle friend was simply a
[1:25:49] representation
[1:25:51] of the office that he now held elisha
[1:25:54] held
[1:25:55] it was it was simply but the life had to
[1:25:58] be what
[1:25:59] followed to match what the garment was
[1:26:02] saying to them
[1:26:03] so when they saw that garment they saw
[1:26:06] something
[1:26:08] they saw something of significance
[1:26:10] reason
[1:26:11] purpose the mantle had a reason purpose
[1:26:14] the one who wore it was that one that
[1:26:17] was the called
[1:26:18] it was that one that had that gift that
[1:26:22] prophetic gift so if you were wearing
[1:26:24] that mantle
[1:26:25] your life had to match the mantle
[1:26:29] the garment if you're expecting to have
[1:26:32] the bride's garment the word on clothes
[1:26:35] you today you have to have a life that's
[1:26:38] a representation of
[1:26:39] of the reflection of that word jesus
[1:26:42] christ
[1:26:43] if you don't then what do people think
[1:26:45] right they say well that person
[1:26:47] confesses to be a christian
[1:26:49] that person goes to church they act like
[1:26:51] they're a christian
[1:26:52] uh uh sometimes but then you know other
[1:26:55] times
[1:26:57] they they tend not to reflect jesus too
[1:26:59] much
[1:27:01] they look and say well i i don't think i
[1:27:03] ever saw jesus do that
[1:27:05] i don't think i ever saw jesus say that
[1:27:07] or talk that way since
[1:27:09] it's got to be something that's a a
[1:27:11] representation
[1:27:13] of a reflection of your life from the
[1:27:16] word
[1:27:17] it it's simply that that that's what
[1:27:19] that garment represents
[1:27:21] but see the only way to do it is to is
[1:27:23] to grow in grace to grow in the
[1:27:25] knowledge
[1:27:26] now let's transition from from elijah
[1:27:29] and elisha for a moment
[1:27:31] and this again let's take the next 30
[1:27:33] minutes or so
[1:27:34] and let's talk about more talk about us
[1:27:38] let's talk about the scripture the
[1:27:40] modern day scripture
[1:27:41] you know jesus did the exact same thing
[1:27:44] to his disciples he does the exact same
[1:27:47] thing today
[1:27:49] invitation has gone forth we'll talk
[1:27:51] about that in a minute
[1:27:53] but see jesus gave his disciples and he
[1:27:56] gives everyone
[1:27:57] and he gives you today the exact same
[1:28:00] choice
[1:28:01] the exact same decision what are you
[1:28:03] going to do with it
[1:28:05] now look when jesus
[1:28:09] fed the multitudes and they came across
[1:28:12] the lake and
[1:28:13] many of them followed him and they they
[1:28:15] wanted to talk to him and
[1:28:16] get stuff from him and in john chapter
[1:28:19] six let's go to john chapter six
[1:28:26] we'll read start with in in john chapter
[1:28:28] 6.
[1:28:30] and if you know john chapter 6 at all
[1:28:33] you know that they debate with jesus
[1:28:36] back and forth now these are his
[1:28:37] disciples that are supposed to be the
[1:28:39] believers
[1:28:40] they're supposed to be the ones to now
[1:28:42] as in disciples
[1:28:44] followers not the 12 he chosen okay
[1:28:47] that that is we're not talking about
[1:28:49] that we're talking about the ones
[1:28:50] that followed with him the bible calls
[1:28:52] them disciples
[1:28:54] because they were followers of jesus
[1:28:55] they were following him where he went
[1:28:57] they saw the miracles and their bellies
[1:29:00] got full and
[1:29:01] uh and the great things that happened
[1:29:03] with jesus so they became
[1:29:04] disciples or followers of jesus they
[1:29:07] weren't his twelve
[1:29:08] now twelve were there too but we're not
[1:29:11] talking about just the 12.
[1:29:13] so he's supposed to be the one that
[1:29:16] they're following
[1:29:17] they have confidence trust faith in
[1:29:20] but yet they begin to question him one
[1:29:23] thing after the
[1:29:24] other and he debates and back and forth
[1:29:26] and finally gets to the point where he
[1:29:27] just lays it to him he says
[1:29:29] i am the bread that come down out of
[1:29:33] heaven
[1:29:34] i am the bread of life unless you eat my
[1:29:37] flesh
[1:29:38] and drink my blood you have no part with
[1:29:40] me
[1:29:42] i mean he just got right serious right
[1:29:44] down to him now
[1:29:45] without revelation friend that's a very
[1:29:48] radical statement
[1:29:49] unless you unless just reveal to you and
[1:29:52] you know what he's talking about
[1:29:54] and of course if he's speaking to you as
[1:29:56] his loved one
[1:29:58] as his bride then you know you know what
[1:30:01] he's telling you
[1:30:01] because it it's not just words that come
[1:30:04] and hit your ears
[1:30:05] or that you read off a page it's
[1:30:07] something that's revealed to you
[1:30:08] it's something that you see that it
[1:30:10] becomes a part of you
[1:30:12] because you know what he's talking about
[1:30:14] they didn't
[1:30:15] when he said i am that bread that come
[1:30:18] down out of heaven
[1:30:19] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:30:21] blood you have no part with me
[1:30:22] they're without revelation that's
[1:30:25] radical friend they they didn't know
[1:30:26] what to do with that
[1:30:27] right so they got down now to the 20 to
[1:30:30] the 60th verse
[1:30:36] saint john 6 60 many therefore of his
[1:30:40] disciples
[1:30:42] when they heard this said this is a hard
[1:30:45] saying who can hear it you know people
[1:30:48] do the exact same thing today
[1:30:51] you may be or have witnessed the family
[1:30:53] members or people or friends that you
[1:30:55] know
[1:30:56] and they'll try to tell you the exact
[1:30:58] same thing
[1:30:59] why do you look like that why do you act
[1:31:02] like that
[1:31:03] why don't you watch this why don't you
[1:31:05] go here
[1:31:06] why do you wear those clothes why do you
[1:31:09] look the way you do
[1:31:11] why is it that you're different than
[1:31:13] everybody else
[1:31:14] oh you just think you're more special
[1:31:16] than everybody
[1:31:18] what they don't know the truth of it is
[1:31:20] is you're not special
[1:31:21] you're just special amen
[1:31:25] you're not special in their vernacular
[1:31:29] but you're special in his and that's all
[1:31:32] that really matters
[1:31:34] but they'll tell you why do you do that
[1:31:37] you don't need to live like that god
[1:31:39] doesn't care
[1:31:41] god doesn't mind if you do this a little
[1:31:43] or if you go there a little or if you
[1:31:44] act this way a little
[1:31:45] if you wear that or if you chop off that
[1:31:49] stringy hair you know i'm sure you've
[1:31:50] heard it uh you god doesn't care it
[1:31:53] doesn't matter
[1:31:54] god doesn't mind god
[1:31:57] it's okay see because that's a hard
[1:31:59] saying to most people
[1:32:01] they come and they look and they say and
[1:32:04] they look at this message which you're a
[1:32:06] reflection of
[1:32:07] this word which you're a reflection of
[1:32:09] because you have on the wedding garments
[1:32:12] and they look and say that's a hard
[1:32:14] saying
[1:32:16] that's a hard way of living no it really
[1:32:19] isn't
[1:32:20] give it a try sometime but without the
[1:32:23] holy ghost
[1:32:24] and without revelation yes it is
[1:32:27] yes but the question then becomes
[1:32:30] who can hear this who can do this
[1:32:34] who can live this friend not only will
[1:32:38] the bride
[1:32:38] hear it not only will she live it but
[1:32:42] she becomes it
[1:32:45] but to others they don't know
[1:32:48] because it doesn't mean anything to them
[1:32:51] how can you do that
[1:32:53] how can you live that way oh that's hard
[1:32:56] that that's a that's a tough life boy
[1:32:58] you're just binding yourself down no
[1:33:00] what you don't realize
[1:33:02] is that i have been liberated in jesus
[1:33:04] christ
[1:33:05] but because i've been born again my
[1:33:07] liberation causes me to want to live a
[1:33:10] life that's pleasing to
[1:33:11] jesus christ that's what i do
[1:33:15] because that's who i am yes others say
[1:33:18] oh that's hard how could you do that
[1:33:20] how could you have you had to have fun
[1:33:22] family members or friends tell you oh
[1:33:24] you don't need to do that
[1:33:26] oh that's a hard thing why do you do
[1:33:28] that you shouldn't live that you just
[1:33:30] that that's just bondage that's so hard
[1:33:32] that's exactly the same thing that
[1:33:34] unbelievers were saying then
[1:33:36] but because it's a revelation to you
[1:33:39] because it's a revelation of the word
[1:33:41] that's been revealed
[1:33:42] to your heart by the holy spirit living
[1:33:44] in you you know
[1:33:46] what god has done for you so many of
[1:33:48] them left they said this is a hard
[1:33:50] saying who can hear it
[1:33:52] and when jesus knew in himself that his
[1:33:54] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:33:56] them does this offend you
[1:33:58] what and if you shall see the son of man
[1:34:00] to send up where he was before
[1:34:03] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:34:05] flesh propheted nothing the words that i
[1:34:07] speak
[1:34:08] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:34:10] life
[1:34:11] but there are some of you that believe
[1:34:13] not for jesus knew from the beginning
[1:34:15] who they were that believe
[1:34:16] not and who should betray him and he
[1:34:19] said therefore i say unto you that
[1:34:21] no man can come unto me except it were
[1:34:23] given unto him by my father
[1:34:24] praise the lord from that time
[1:34:28] amen separation from
[1:34:32] that time many of his disciples went
[1:34:35] back and no
[1:34:36] walk no more with him disciples
[1:34:40] followers of jesus left him
[1:34:44] parted from him had no more relation
[1:34:48] with him at all friend foe
[1:34:52] they parted what parted them
[1:34:55] the truth the word
[1:34:58] the word my friend when it's lived
[1:35:01] when it's coming to a life and lived has
[1:35:04] separated
[1:35:05] many a friend many a family
[1:35:09] because there's got to be a separation
[1:35:11] to divide
[1:35:14] belief from unbelief
[1:35:17] that's the only prejudice that god even
[1:35:20] has
[1:35:22] god's not worried about the color of a
[1:35:24] person's skin we all bleed red
[1:35:26] he's not worried about nationality we're
[1:35:28] all humans
[1:35:30] but what he does care about is belief
[1:35:33] being separated from unbelief
[1:35:35] do not be unequally yoked see
[1:35:39] that's his word that's the scripture
[1:35:41] that's what he does
[1:35:42] care about so many of them left because
[1:35:44] they could not take the revelation of
[1:35:46] the word
[1:35:47] right so they went away from him they're
[1:35:50] molding
[1:35:51] they're shaping their clay to the potter
[1:35:55] has now broke into pieces because they
[1:35:59] they desired no more to be molded by god
[1:36:01] right
[1:36:02] this is too hard i can't take this and
[1:36:05] there's been many people to do that
[1:36:07] i i i've even heard people say well i
[1:36:10] believe it's the truth but i just can't
[1:36:11] do it
[1:36:12] i just can't live it
[1:36:16] i i don't know how you can make that
[1:36:17] statement as a literal fact because if
[1:36:20] you really believe something
[1:36:21] you're gonna do it you're going to live
[1:36:23] it if you really do believe it
[1:36:26] not not just something that's a verbage
[1:36:28] that comes across your lips but i mean
[1:36:29] an actual
[1:36:30] indwelling in your heart that you that
[1:36:32] you really believe
[1:36:35] people can say oh i believe the world is
[1:36:37] round do you really believe it
[1:36:40] some people might still even today say i
[1:36:42] think the world's flat well do you
[1:36:43] really believe it
[1:36:45] let's get in the car just drive and see
[1:36:47] if we fall off the edge
[1:36:49] or get in the boat get on the ocean
[1:36:51] we'll just go till we fall off the edge
[1:36:53] do you really believe what do you really
[1:36:55] believe
[1:36:56] see because it's not just something that
[1:36:58] is an intellect
[1:36:59] it's got to be something that's in the
[1:37:01] heart it's got to be something that's in
[1:37:03] not just in the spirit but in your soul
[1:37:06] is it true is it real if it is you're
[1:37:08] going to do it
[1:37:10] amen you're going to do it if you truly
[1:37:13] if somebody told you i've used this
[1:37:14] before but if somebody told you there
[1:37:16] was
[1:37:16] a a a million hundred dollar bills in
[1:37:18] this building
[1:37:20] and you believe them what would you do
[1:37:23] oh i just stay at home you know
[1:37:27] go to the store and struggle to pay for
[1:37:29] my groceries
[1:37:30] i know there's a hundred million dollars
[1:37:32] sitting over there i really believe
[1:37:34] it too i really do i believe who told me
[1:37:36] i believe it i truly believe
[1:37:38] in fact i've even poked in the window
[1:37:40] and i've looked a little bit and i saw
[1:37:42] it it's in there
[1:37:43] but you know i can't i i don't want to
[1:37:46] go in there
[1:37:48] it doesn't work that way if you really
[1:37:51] believe something
[1:37:52] you're gonna do it you're gonna believe
[1:37:54] it you're gonna live it it's gonna
[1:37:56] become a part of you
[1:37:57] but i've known people that that they
[1:37:59] would actually make that statement
[1:38:01] oh i believe it i just can't live it oh
[1:38:04] friend
[1:38:04] where do those people stand there but
[1:38:06] now from that time
[1:38:08] when the word came real from that time
[1:38:13] they rocked off and left him now look
[1:38:16] jesus giving his 12 that he personally
[1:38:20] hand picked the same
[1:38:21] the same choice same choice
[1:38:24] just like elijah gave elisha this is the
[1:38:27] choice
[1:38:27] you have to make a decision
[1:38:31] you're a free moral agent
[1:38:34] then jesus said then said jesus unto the
[1:38:38] twelve
[1:38:38] will ye go all gold also go away
[1:38:42] then simon peter answered him lord to
[1:38:45] whom shall we go
[1:38:46] that's right one of the greatest
[1:38:49] ascendances
[1:38:50] i believe in the entire scripture where
[1:38:52] can we go
[1:38:53] right where could i go i've told y'all
[1:38:57] before all
[1:38:58] my proverbial eggs are in one proverbial
[1:39:01] basket and that basket's called jesus
[1:39:04] if jesus turns out not to be real which
[1:39:08] it's hard for me to even say that
[1:39:09] because that's that's of course
[1:39:11] wrong i i'm i'm done
[1:39:14] because he's my everything my everything
[1:39:18] is in him
[1:39:19] he's my all in all i i don't i don't
[1:39:21] have a plan b
[1:39:23] i don't have a backup am i he's
[1:39:26] everything
[1:39:27] he's all yeah i i don't have any other
[1:39:30] place to go say you know if this jesus
[1:39:32] thing don't work out
[1:39:33] and maybe i'll go try this or try it no
[1:39:35] no no no
[1:39:36] no it's it's it's all in one basket it's
[1:39:39] it's him or nothing
[1:39:41] right that's it that's all i have
[1:39:44] but i believe that's all i need too yeah
[1:39:46] yeah but he said where are you gonna go
[1:39:49] and they said where could we go we have
[1:39:51] no other place to go thou
[1:39:54] has the words of eternal life we may not
[1:39:57] know what you're saying
[1:39:58] we may not understand what you just told
[1:40:00] them but we know
[1:40:02] that you have the words of eternal life
[1:40:04] right i
[1:40:06] may not understand it all but i believe
[1:40:08] it
[1:40:09] and because i believe it i'm staying
[1:40:11] right here
[1:40:13] amen isn't that just exactly what elisha
[1:40:15] did
[1:40:16] yes god jesus
[1:40:19] gave his disciples a choice well you
[1:40:22] just go away
[1:40:23] if you want to you can go away too or
[1:40:25] you're going to leave too and they said
[1:40:27] we're not going to leave you isn't that
[1:40:29] what elisha said oh
[1:40:30] we're i'm never going to leave you i'm
[1:40:32] going wherever you go
[1:40:34] because i want to get what god has
[1:40:36] promised through you to me
[1:40:38] so i'm going to be with you praise the
[1:40:40] lord i'm going to walk with you wherever
[1:40:41] you go whatever you do however you act
[1:40:43] whatever you eat i'm going to be there
[1:40:47] peter says where are we going to go god
[1:40:49] where are we going to go
[1:40:50] you have the words of eternal life
[1:40:54] i don't understand he may have even
[1:40:56] looked to his other brothers and said
[1:40:58] eat his flesh drink his what is it you
[1:41:01] fellas know what he's talking about
[1:41:04] how are we supposed to eat on his how
[1:41:07] are we supposed to do this
[1:41:09] i mean because if you think naturally
[1:41:11] and understand these they hadn't
[1:41:12] received the holy ghost yet
[1:41:14] right i mean but the truth of it is
[1:41:18] it's like brother braham said it's not
[1:41:20] so important that you
[1:41:21] understand everything but you believe
[1:41:23] everything
[1:41:24] right and they proved they believed it
[1:41:27] because they stayed with him
[1:41:29] elisha proved he believed it he
[1:41:32] he dedicated his choice that was
[1:41:35] determined because of the mantle that
[1:41:37] was thrown on him
[1:41:38] i am not going to leave you i'm going to
[1:41:41] stay with you
[1:41:42] whatever we go through and whatever
[1:41:44] happens i will endure and i will go
[1:41:46] through
[1:41:47] peter says you have the words of eternal
[1:41:49] life we have no other place to go
[1:41:52] and we believe and are sure that thou
[1:41:55] art the christ the son of the living god
[1:41:58] praise the lord amen hey they had the
[1:42:01] choice
[1:42:02] you can leave too you want to leave go
[1:42:04] ahead and leave
[1:42:06] many of them left but the 12 stood there
[1:42:09] and one of them was a devil genesis
[1:42:12] carrick was still there with him
[1:42:13] and he stayed there too of course a lot
[1:42:16] of times it becomes a
[1:42:17] mob mentality you know people get used
[1:42:19] to being around certain people and they
[1:42:21] they won't leave regardless no matter
[1:42:24] what happens
[1:42:25] uh they stay right there but and
[1:42:28] and but it wasn't ordained for him
[1:42:29] either just wasn't his time
[1:42:31] so all 12 so they stayed and said oh
[1:42:34] we're going to stay
[1:42:35] we're going to follow you jesus uh
[1:42:38] we're going to lay on the rocks we're
[1:42:40] going to go hungry
[1:42:42] uh we're gonna do whatever we have to do
[1:42:46] whatever you do we're gonna do it how do
[1:42:49] you act we're gonna act
[1:42:50] whatever you say we're gonna say
[1:42:52] whatever you eat we're gonna eat
[1:42:53] whatever you wear we're gonna wear
[1:42:56] we want to be just like you amen
[1:42:59] because you have the words of eternal
[1:43:01] life and we are absolutely convinced
[1:43:04] that you are the son of the living god
[1:43:08] amen that should be the resolve of
[1:43:11] every christian today regardless of what
[1:43:14] some church or some pastor says
[1:43:16] jesus i am going to stay with you
[1:43:18] regardless because i want my life to
[1:43:20] emulate you
[1:43:21] in every way whatever you said in your
[1:43:24] word for me to do
[1:43:25] i'm gonna do whatever your word says for
[1:43:27] me to wear i'm gonna wear
[1:43:29] whatever your word says for me to eat
[1:43:31] i'm gonna eat wherever it tells me to go
[1:43:32] not go
[1:43:33] that's what i'm gonna do because i know
[1:43:36] that you
[1:43:37] have the words of eternal life amen
[1:43:40] because we get that same choice every
[1:43:42] day friend oh you can leave
[1:43:45] anybody in this building this morning
[1:43:46] can walk out that door and leave never
[1:43:48] see you again
[1:43:48] it's your choice right you can do it if
[1:43:50] you want
[1:43:52] amen children are a little harder
[1:43:54] because maybe they don't have any other
[1:43:55] place to go

[1:43:59] don't believe the young ones here want
[1:44:00] to anyway but thank the lord for that

[1:47:05] situations and troubles
[1:47:06] god is always with us let's go to
[1:47:09] another one
[1:47:10] luke saint luke chapter 24
[1:47:19] the disciples elisha would not leave the
[1:47:22] disciples
[1:47:23] would not leave the 12 the one
[1:47:25] eventually judas did
[1:47:27] but the other 11 stayed right there some
[1:47:30] crucified sideways
[1:47:32] right because they believed it so much
[1:47:36] you know brother said people come out
[1:47:37] and say this this is a fake and that's a
[1:47:39] fake and this jesus sitting real and all
[1:47:40] this stuff he said if it wasn't
[1:47:42] why did the people that followed him get
[1:47:44] crucified upside down sideways and
[1:47:46] had their heads chopped off gladly
[1:47:49] went in martimet for the sake of christ
[1:47:53] the word
[1:47:54] why would they do that if this was all
[1:47:56] just put on and made up and fake
[1:47:58] amen because it's not elisha wouldn't go
[1:48:02] disciples wouldn't go but the invitation
[1:48:05] still stands will you go also
[1:48:09] amen my resolve is lord
[1:48:12] you have the words of eternal life i've
[1:48:14] got no other place to go
[1:48:16] i'm not that i want to go any other
[1:48:17] place right this is my home
[1:48:19] jesus christ that's my home st luke
[1:48:22] chapter 24. now let's look at this
[1:48:25] because then jesus gives them another
[1:48:27] one because remember
[1:48:28] this whole time we're being molded and
[1:48:31] shaped and we're growing in grace we're
[1:48:34] growing in the lord
[1:48:35] we're we're being molded to fit that
[1:48:38] garment
[1:48:38] remember we're being molded to fit that
[1:48:41] garment
[1:48:43] so as we come along on this journey what
[1:48:46] he did with the disciples luke 24
[1:48:49] he gave him very specific instructions
[1:48:53] he said uh we'll just read the
[1:48:56] 48 24 49 and behold i send the promise
[1:49:00] of my father upon you
[1:49:02] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[1:49:06] until ye be endued with power from on
[1:49:09] high
[1:49:10] now what is this jesus tell them jesus
[1:49:13] is saying
[1:49:14] i send the promise of my father upon you
[1:49:18] that that promise now that promise is
[1:49:22] going to come
[1:49:23] he already declared it and of course he
[1:49:25] says in many other places in the
[1:49:26] scripture we'll read one in a little bit
[1:49:29] where he says that promise is going to
[1:49:31] come but what you need to do
[1:49:34] is you need to tarry here in the city of
[1:49:37] jerusalem
[1:49:38] until you be endued with power from on
[1:49:42] high
[1:49:42] you stay here until that and just terry
[1:49:46] be still be patient wait on the lord
[1:49:50] and that promise will come the holy
[1:49:53] spirit will fall down upon you
[1:49:55] amen now of course i'm paraphrasing the
[1:49:57] word but that's we know exactly what
[1:49:58] happened
[1:49:59] that word that that spirit will come
[1:50:01] down
[1:50:02] that power will will be endured to you
[1:50:05] from on high
[1:50:06] because of the promise of god that i
[1:50:09] send back
[1:50:10] unto you which we know is his own life
[1:50:12] the holy spirit
[1:50:14] that holy spirit that he said but you've
[1:50:15] got to tarry here
[1:50:17] you can't just go here and go yonder and
[1:50:20] go do this
[1:50:21] and live this kind of life and be like
[1:50:22] this and go no no
[1:50:24] you tarry here patient
[1:50:28] wait let the lord minister to you
[1:50:32] let the shaping take place in your life
[1:50:34] let the lord mold you and make you
[1:50:37] until you be endued with power from on
[1:50:39] high
[1:50:41] now the rest of this
[1:50:45] i wanted to read that the 50th verse and
[1:50:48] he led them out as far as to bethany
[1:50:50] raised up his hands and blessed them
[1:50:52] and it came to pass while he blessed
[1:50:54] them he was
[1:50:55] parted from them and carried up into
[1:50:58] heaven and they worshipped him and
[1:50:59] returned to jerusalem with great joy
[1:51:02] and were continually in the temple
[1:51:05] praising and blessing god
[1:51:07] amen now see what brother branham says
[1:51:10] here
[1:51:10] an identification this is 1963 january
[1:51:14] 1963 identification
[1:51:17] he says we've got to take as full gospel
[1:51:20] people
[1:51:25] as full gospel people we have identified
[1:51:28] ourselves as full gospel people
[1:51:30] let's mold our character we're invited
[1:51:34] to be molded in his image
[1:51:37] praise the lord that we might reflect
[1:51:40] his presence
[1:51:42] now when did that invitation come and
[1:51:44] the invitation come in acts
[1:51:46] we'll read in just a minute the
[1:51:49] invitation come
[1:51:50] when the invitation come they had a
[1:51:52] choice
[1:51:53] elisha had a choice when the mantle came
[1:51:56] and the invitation was there
[1:51:58] they had a choice what are we going to
[1:51:59] do with this
[1:52:01] these disciples had a choice will you go
[1:52:03] away no no we're going to stay right
[1:52:05] here
[1:52:06] well then the promise of god is going to
[1:52:09] come down upon you
[1:52:10] stay in jerusalem terry here and that
[1:52:13] power will come and
[1:52:14] uh from on high
[1:52:17] you will be endued with power from on
[1:52:19] high now
[1:52:20] brother i'm saying we're invited we're
[1:52:23] invited
[1:52:24] as strange the way he puts that invited
[1:52:28] in invitation i think the way he did it
[1:52:32] the lord speaking through him the way he
[1:52:34] did it
[1:52:35] allowed for the opportunity of decision
[1:52:38] of free moral agency
[1:52:39] because an invitation is is
[1:52:42] is not a mandate it's not a directive
[1:52:46] uh it's not an absolute it's simply an
[1:52:50] invitation
[1:52:51] you can accept it or you can reject it
[1:52:53] it's the choice
[1:52:54] i i believe that may be some of the
[1:52:56] reason it was that it was
[1:52:58] given that way we're invited that's your
[1:53:00] choice
[1:53:01] we're invited to be molded in his image
[1:53:05] that we might reflect his presence and
[1:53:07] the works that i
[1:53:09] do shall you do also the life that i
[1:53:12] live shall you live so we're invited by
[1:53:15] god to take him as an example
[1:53:17] and let our character be molded like his
[1:53:21] he said what a thing brother my
[1:53:24] we have uh then we have we let his
[1:53:27] character
[1:53:28] be in us then we have become sons
[1:53:31] by having the mind of christ the mind
[1:53:34] which is the character
[1:53:37] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:53:39] in christ jesus right
[1:53:40] the choice the decision he said we have
[1:53:44] that invitation to let our character be
[1:53:47] molded
[1:53:48] molded to what to be like his character
[1:53:52] to be able to fit that that that dress
[1:53:55] to be able to fit that word garment
[1:53:58] we've been invited to be molded to let
[1:54:02] the word
[1:54:03] mold us to let the spirit continue to
[1:54:05] mold us
[1:54:06] to fit that image we've been invited to
[1:54:08] do that brother adam says my that's what
[1:54:10] a thing that
[1:54:11] is an invitation that jesus gave
[1:54:14] now you're not the only ones that have
[1:54:16] that invitation
[1:54:18] everybody around the world has that
[1:54:19] invitation everybody since christ has
[1:54:22] had that invitation
[1:54:23] everybody that ever lives has had that
[1:54:25] invitation if not
[1:54:27] god has to give them life if they
[1:54:30] haven't had the choice then he's got to
[1:54:31] give him life or he's not a just god
[1:54:34] everybody's had that choice that
[1:54:35] decision what are you going to do with
[1:54:37] the decision the invitation that god has
[1:54:40] given
[1:54:43] our character is to be molded
[1:54:46] by what's on the inside of us and our
[1:54:49] outside only expresses what is on the
[1:54:52] inside
[1:54:52] what are we how we walk how we talk
[1:54:56] no matter no matter what we say our life
[1:55:00] speaks louder than our words do amen
[1:55:05] now in acts chapter 1
[1:55:10] i'm going to try to finish this up here
[1:55:15] in acts chapter 1 verse 1
[1:55:20] the former treaties have i made all
[1:55:22] theophilus of all that jesus began to do
[1:55:25] both to do and teach until the day in
[1:55:28] which he was taken up
[1:55:29] after the after he through the holy
[1:55:32] ghost had given commandments unto the
[1:55:33] apostles
[1:55:34] whom he had chosen to whom also he
[1:55:38] showed himself alive after his passion
[1:55:40] by many
[1:55:41] un infallible proofs being seen of them
[1:55:44] 40 days and speaking of the things
[1:55:46] pertaining to the kingdom of god
[1:55:48] and that's part of where we get the
[1:55:50] understanding that uh the dead in christ
[1:55:52] arise and be with us for for 40 days
[1:55:55] right let's say 40.
[1:55:56] brother braham talks about it but that's
[1:55:58] 40 days brother branham told brother
[1:56:00] green
[1:56:00] brother green's testimony he said a
[1:56:02] minimum of 30 days
[1:56:04] well the bible says here he was with us
[1:56:05] for 40 days we get that 40 days
[1:56:08] the dead in christ will rise and appear
[1:56:10] in divinity just like the bible said
[1:56:12] we have the types we know what the bible
[1:56:13] says this resurrection won't be
[1:56:16] different from that in that way 40 days
[1:56:20] speaking of things pertains to the
[1:56:21] kingdom of god and being assembled
[1:56:23] together with them
[1:56:24] commanded them that they should not
[1:56:26] depart from jerusalem but wait for the
[1:56:28] promise
[1:56:29] of the father which said ye have heard
[1:56:31] of me for
[1:56:32] john truly baptized with water but ye
[1:56:34] shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:56:36] not many days hence
[1:56:37] when they when they therefore were come
[1:56:39] together they asked of him
[1:56:41] saying lord wilt thou at this time
[1:56:44] restore again the kingdom to israel
[1:56:46] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:56:48] to know the times or the seasons
[1:56:50] which the father has put in his own
[1:56:52] power but ye shall receive
[1:56:54] power after that the holy ghost has come
[1:56:56] upon you
[1:56:57] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:57:00] in jerusalem in all judea
[1:57:02] and in samaria and unto the other most
[1:57:04] parts of the earth now it's just a
[1:57:05] reiteration
[1:57:07] or a speaking over again of the promise
[1:57:11] that jesus had already given to them
[1:57:13] you do this and you have this you stay
[1:57:16] here go to jerusalem
[1:57:18] tarry you'll ris being do with power
[1:57:20] from on high this is the promise that
[1:57:22] god gave
[1:57:23] this is the promise that we receive as
[1:57:25] his children as his disciples
[1:57:27] and when he had spoken these things
[1:57:29] while they beheld
[1:57:30] he was taken up with a cloud taken up
[1:57:34] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:57:36] sight
[1:57:36] and while they look steadfastly toward
[1:57:38] heaven as he went up behold two men
[1:57:40] still by them and white apparel
[1:57:42] which also said you men of galilee why
[1:57:45] stand you gazing up into heaven
[1:57:47] this same jesus which was taken up from
[1:57:49] you into heaven shall
[1:57:50] all shall so come in like manner as ye
[1:57:52] have seen him go into heaven
[1:57:54] that's the promise of god that was the
[1:57:57] promise he to give the promise to the
[1:57:59] disciples
[1:57:59] now what did the disciples do they
[1:58:02] followed his word
[1:58:04] many of them left
[1:58:07] judas proved to he was the eleven were
[1:58:10] still there
[1:58:11] and how many saw him go away
[1:58:15] just like elijah elijah went away in the
[1:58:18] sight of elisha
[1:58:20] they're with him this whole time and
[1:58:22] they learned
[1:58:23] and they were taught and they were
[1:58:25] molded and they were shaped just like
[1:58:27] our invitation
[1:58:28] just like the invitation god said
[1:58:30] brother graham said that we have today
[1:58:31] by god
[1:58:33] we've been invited very much that our
[1:58:35] character be molded
[1:58:37] did our character be shaped that our
[1:58:39] character be molded to
[1:58:41] fit and to emulate his character
[1:58:44] to be like jesus that's the invitation
[1:58:46] same invitation today
[1:58:48] amen they had that then and then they
[1:58:51] just like elisha
[1:58:53] they watched him go away and they saw
[1:58:55] him going to heaven he says as you see
[1:58:57] me go away
[1:58:58] you'll know that i'll be sending the
[1:59:00] promise of the father back unto you
[1:59:02] acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day
[1:59:05] of pentecost was fully come there were
[1:59:06] all with one accord and one place
[1:59:09] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:59:10] as the rushing mighty wind and it filled
[1:59:12] all the house where they were sitting
[1:59:15] there's the mantle there's the mantle
[1:59:18] jesus goes away just like elisha
[1:59:21] elijah and what did he do
[1:59:24] he threw back a mantle upon the people
[1:59:28] the holy spirit and it was their choice
[1:59:31] the holy ghost was just an invitation
[1:59:35] will you accept it will you receive it
[1:59:39] will you let the holy ghost come into
[1:59:41] your life will you let
[1:59:42] jesus take over your life will you let
[1:59:45] him mold you
[1:59:46] and make you and shape you nobody said
[1:59:50] it's an easy walk
[1:59:51] right nobody said it was going to be
[1:59:52] like a bed of roses
[1:59:54] it is not mainly because our human flesh
[1:59:58] fights so hard against the things of god
[2:00:02] because the spirit of the devil is
[2:00:04] enmity with god
[2:00:06] and it's and it has influence over our
[2:00:08] spirits and over our bodies
[2:00:11] and our bodies and our spirits live with
[2:00:13] that
[2:00:14] influx of all the world stuff that comes
[2:00:16] in all the time
[2:00:17] from out here from out in satan's eaton
[2:00:20] and it influences and
[2:00:22] and that's the biggest battle we have
[2:00:24] brother bam talk about the greatest
[2:00:25] battle ever fought
[2:00:26] in the mind that greatest battle ever
[2:00:29] fought
[2:00:29] is there because it runs as enemy
[2:00:32] against god that's the hardest thing
[2:00:34] that we have to fight against
[2:00:35] right the hardest thing i have to fight
[2:00:37] against is the mind
[2:00:38] the man that you're looking at right now
[2:00:42] i'm the one that has the hardest problem
[2:00:44] with me
[2:00:47] i'm the one that has to fight the
[2:00:48] hardest to get me to die
[2:00:52] that's the hardest part amen
[2:00:55] but when we do the promise of god's word
[2:00:57] is so much greater
[2:00:59] that it and the spirit that's within you
[2:01:01] molds our character on the outside to
[2:01:03] where the outside
[2:01:04] simply becomes a reflection the mantle
[2:01:08] simply a reflection of what's on the
[2:01:11] inside
[2:01:12] the mantle was thrown back on them and
[2:01:15] they had the choice
[2:01:19] there came a sound from heaven a rusty
[2:01:21] mighty wind it filled all the house
[2:01:22] where they were sitting
[2:01:24] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[2:01:26] like as a fire and it sat upon each of
[2:01:28] them and they were all
[2:01:30] filled with the holy ghost and began to
[2:01:32] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[2:01:34] gave them utterance
[2:01:36] amen now those around they didn't
[2:01:38] completely understand that
[2:01:40] give me just a couple more minutes they
[2:01:43] didn't completely understand that
[2:01:45] so as peter the big mouth that come out
[2:01:48] that always you know he's
[2:01:49] always getting himself in trouble but in
[2:01:52] a lot of cases he was
[2:01:53] he spoke profound things he was the one
[2:01:55] that spoke up when jesus said are you
[2:01:57] going to go away
[2:01:58] peter was the one that spoke up and said
[2:01:59] where are we going to go right you have
[2:02:01] the words of eternal life
[2:02:03] peter was also the one that that said uh
[2:02:05] uh
[2:02:06] that rebuked jesus when he talked about
[2:02:08] leaving and and jesus had to say get
[2:02:10] thee behind me satan
[2:02:12] well he wasn't calling peter satan but
[2:02:14] the spirit that was
[2:02:16] influencing peter's statement was of the
[2:02:18] devil right
[2:02:19] so god said jesus said get he behind me
[2:02:22] satan
[2:02:22] but now peter stands up and the
[2:02:25] invitation goes out
[2:02:27] the holy ghost came in 120 that were
[2:02:29] there friend but it wasn't exclusive to
[2:02:31] the 120 the invitation was broadcast
[2:02:34] throughout the world
[2:02:35] for every human to ever live to have
[2:02:37] that choice
[2:02:40] peter said now 37th verse now when they
[2:02:43] heard this they were pricked in their
[2:02:45] hearts and said unto
[2:02:46] peter and the rest of the disciples
[2:02:47] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[2:02:50] do
[2:02:51] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:02:54] baptized
[2:02:54] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:02:56] christ for the remission of sins
[2:02:58] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:03:00] holy ghost for the promise is unto you
[2:03:03] and to your children and to
[2:03:07] and to them that are far off even as
[2:03:10] many as the lord are god shall call
[2:03:13] shall call what is that that's an
[2:03:16] invitation
[2:03:18] it's the invitation now as god's calling
[2:03:21] what are people doing what are people
[2:03:24] saying
[2:03:27] we're winding down to the end of this
[2:03:29] thing friend yes we know that this can't
[2:03:31] be much longer
[2:03:33] a year two years five ten we don't know
[2:03:36] right but we do know it just can't go on
[2:03:38] much longer the way it is
[2:03:39] right we do see the things that's
[2:03:41] happening and the prophecies of the
[2:03:43] prophet gave us and the scriptural
[2:03:44] vindications in revelation 13
[2:03:47] we know that there's going to be a whole
[2:03:49] cell attack
[2:03:50] there already is when
[2:03:53] 20 years ago a catholic priest will hold
[2:03:56] up a message book and tell you
[2:03:58] this is our greatest enemy don't you
[2:04:00] don't think they don't know who you are
[2:04:03] they know exactly who we are and we are
[2:04:05] the enemy
[2:04:06] and according to revelation 13 it's
[2:04:09] going to overcome
[2:04:10] anyone that is not born again
[2:04:13] to have the holy ghost to go in the
[2:04:16] rapture
[2:04:17] right and only the bride will go in the
[2:04:19] rapture
[2:04:20] right that's just only the bride goes
[2:04:23] that's just
[2:04:24] the way it is so the good thing is to
[2:04:27] get into christ
[2:04:29] the invitations come to get into him if
[2:04:32] we get into him
[2:04:34] and we let that and let our character be
[2:04:36] molded and shaped
[2:04:38] to fit into that word amen to where
[2:04:40] people look and they
[2:04:42] they they don't see a literal wedding
[2:04:45] dress
[2:04:46] but they see a garment that you're
[2:04:48] clothed in and that garment is the
[2:04:50] unmerited favor and grace
[2:04:53] and the righteousness of jesus christ
[2:04:55] his word
[2:04:57] that word molding shaping
[2:05:00] but i don't know i'm not sure about that
[2:05:03] one god i just
[2:05:05] well you know uh maybe you need a little
[2:05:07] more molding
[2:05:08] yes amen right no doubt
[2:05:11] no unbelief elisha stayed with elijah
[2:05:16] never left his side and when he saw him
[2:05:18] go he got the promise
[2:05:20] amen he got the promise just like we got
[2:05:24] the promise
[2:05:24] what is our promise today saint john 14
[2:05:27] verily verily
[2:05:28] 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he
[2:05:30] that believeth on work
[2:05:31] on me the words that i do shall he do
[2:05:34] also and
[2:05:35] greater works than these what did elisha
[2:05:38] get
[2:05:38] a double portion what is god telling us
[2:05:41] greater works
[2:05:43] not even just a double it's just the
[2:05:45] greater works
[2:05:47] greater worse than god almighty jesus
[2:05:50] christ god and flesh on earth that's
[2:05:52] what he said
[2:05:54] greater works than these shall he do
[2:05:56] because i go unto my father
[2:05:58] and listen friend let this encourage you
[2:06:00] today listen real close because i'm
[2:06:02] going to close with this
[2:06:04] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[2:06:07] that will i do amen
[2:06:10] you believe that yes that the father may
[2:06:13] be glorified in the son
[2:06:16] if ye shall ask anything
[2:06:20] in my name i
[2:06:23] will do it
[2:06:26] right that's his word yes not mine
[2:06:30] that's the words of jesus christ
[2:06:34] now my mind goes back to my question
[2:06:37] goes back to do we really believe it
[2:06:39] right people say they believe it oh i
[2:06:42] can't live it i can't do that
[2:06:43] but i believe it no if you believe it it
[2:06:46] becomes you

[2:06:49] living it
[2:06:50] because it's just who you are amen but
[2:06:53] we have to be molded to fit it
