Praise the Lord God. Amen. God bless you today. Amen. Appreciate each one coming, being here today. If you're watching, God bless you. Amen. We have a couple prayer requests to mention today. Um, of course you want to continue with my brother and sister Pat in prayer. Brother Pat did have his surgery Friday on his eyes. Eyes were still blurry, but the surgery all went well. The procedure, I don't know if to call it surgery, but the procedure on his eyes went really well and thankful for that. Of course, I guess I haven't ever had cataracts removed, but uh I hear that after something and mess with your eye, you almost always have blurry vision. So his vision was a little blurry but doing good and uh just appreciate the Lord for that. And remember Sister Pat, she's supposed to have her hip replacement surgery tomorrow. Uh so please remember that in prayer. Uh it's uh it's even though it's I guess be considered somewhat routine anymore with replacement of body parts, knees and hips, uh is still a serious thing. and cut you open and take a piece of you out and put a artificial piece of something in there. Um, so let's please remember sister Pat in prayer. Just trust the Lord that uh that all will be well there. And also I got a text from Sister Sharia this morning said she woke up not feeling well. So please remember her. And of course she also asked for our prayer. Uh I guess he just seems to have chronic back problem. But we're just trusting the Lord to touch him and bring healing virtues down for our heart today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Danny's not here with us. Remember, brother Thomas is tearing them out still. Amen. So, we're just thankful to be here in the house of the Lord today. Does anyone else have a request on your heart? &gt;&gt; Yes. My wife will be having surgery October second. This is the final to take care of what needs she has concerning her breast cancer and breast restoration and so forth. This one's going to be a little bit more extensive. So, this just remember October second. So, remember that prayer for Dennis's wife. Anybody else? Have an unspoken close to your heart. Amen. We uh appreciate your prayers for me. I'm going out this afternoon again. Same travel time at all. Going back to California, the same site. Not quite ready for what we're supposed to do, but there's stuff for us to do. So, we're going back there. So, I appreciate your prayers for that. Amen. It's going to be warm again. Uh not humid though, thankfully that it'll be warm again. Uh also want to remember in prayer, we've had uh some very what I consider tragic things happen this week with the loss of life. Uh that young lady in Charlotte, North Carolina. I used to be proud to say I was from Charlotte. Of course, when I was in Charlotte, it was one it was voted uh when I lived there one of the safest, cleanest, nicest, friendliest towns you could want to move to. And people flock there, especially from the northeast. They they uh run out of work. They all came and they started heading for Florida and they stopped in Charlotte and they found out what a wonderful place it was and they stayed. Uh but uh now it's uh not that way anymore unfortunately. So kind of a shame to even say I'm from there. Mike is from there. He was born in Charlotte. My daughter was born in Charlotte. But anyway, uh that young lady lost her life there. Please remember that and those that were affected by that loss. Uh, also uh the passing and the murder of uh Charlie Kirk. Didn't know him really. I knew of him, heard his name. Never really watched until after he was murdered. And I've watched a lot of things uh that he has said and debates he's had. And uh I I would venture to say today without reservation, he was a godly man. &gt;&gt; Yes. and he spoke of Jesus Christ often. Pretty much almost almost any answer he gave to almost any question uh reverted back to Jesus Christ and God and the Bible and Christianity and love. Uh and unfortunately uh &gt;&gt; I guess a young man couldn't debate him in words, so he shot it and killed it. But uh I have some things I want to say about that. I've been in turmoil kind of decision of what to do today. Um, but I pray that you pray for me and when we get going, the Lord will just show me what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, because it's a it it's a time for the bride to wake up, saints. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It is a time for the bride to wake up. &gt;&gt; She needs to the the the midnight cry has gone out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the bride wakes up when the midnight cry goes out. So, the five wise ver virgins. So, anyway, um just please pray for that family uh and and a lot of people that feel loss at that uh at that murder, at the loss of that individual. Um so, it's kind of a bad place uh that we're in today. Um but the Lord knows. But anyway, far as our prayers, we're remembering in prayer that the Lord would just help his He had a wife and two young children. Uh so the Lord, he was only 31. So uh he was younger than my youngest. Actually, he was born in the same year as Tabitha, but he was younger. Uh because he hadn't had his birthday, but anyway. So please remember them in prayer if you would. So let's stand to our feet if we could. We'll take these knees to the Lord in prayer and ask for these. Lord Jesus, it's an honor once again to be in your house of worship. Lord, we know that it's time to examine our hearts daily. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's a cry that will soon come out. The dead in Christ will show themsself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we'll be going home. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And Lord, I heard to prophet teach many times that you desire to pour your Holy Spirit in us more than what we desire to receive it. And Lord, if there's some that are even present this morning or listening on tape that lack the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that's a prayer. And each and every believer is present here this morning that they'll call on your name. They'll ask you, Lord, to come in their heart, to take away all worldliness, &gt;&gt; to take away all sin. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we know sin is pleasurable for a season, but when it's finished is death if they don't repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, help us to walk in the light. For you are the light, Father, &gt;&gt; to take our walk with you serious. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You promise in your word that he that has begun a good work will perform it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, what is it with certain ones that they just don't want to receive the greatest gift you've given to mankind? It's your own spirit, the baptism of the Holy Ghost living in us, Father. Father, &gt;&gt; and Lord, there are needs this morning. We can't even begin to have the compassion and burden to pray for one another if your Holy Spirit isn't living in us. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes we pray with just empty words. Words that are not meaningful. We know that the word says eternal life is well your prophet said eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when we live for others, we look heaven in the face. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And Lord, our brother Pat who had surgery recently on his eyes. Lord cataract surgery. Lord may you continue to touch our brother. &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus. May his eyesight be fully restored because you said in your word, "Whatever we should ask, believe we shall receive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's doubt that gets us to the place where we're defeated. &gt;&gt; But greater he is in us than he is in the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We claim your promises, Lord. When you gave it to us, he says, "Reach out. My fountain is unlimited. It'll never dry. Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Lord, our my wife who's be having surgery, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, may you guide the surgeon's hands. May all go well for your honor and for your glory. &gt;&gt; Grant and God. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I can't remember all their prayer requests, but you heard them. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know what they are. You won't overlook anyone because everyone is equal and precious in your sight. &gt;&gt; May you come in the scene and minister to the needs of the ones that have uh brought forth a prayer request, an unspoken prayer request. Father, for you, we know that you want us to have a victorious life. If you want us to have a joy that's unspeakable and full of glory and we claim victory and we claim the each and every request for the ones that have need of something from you, Father. &gt;&gt; And bless our pastor, Lord. He's going back. He It's a tough job for the weak when he works. Be with him and guide him and and safely to his destination. give him strength to make it through the weak. And above all, I know he's a light amongst his fellow workers, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know gross darkness has come upon the world, but there's a bride. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a real light, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; May we continue to shine forth for your name's sake as Jesus Christ truly is the same yesterday and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Your precious. Amen. &gt;&gt; May we pray, Father, name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to turn over to Psalm number 51. In the song book, we have it on the screen, but Psalm number 51 in the book. Amen. I say that for those of you here don't know, but there are people who watch online that like have a song book and might follow and listen to the song service. So, I mention the names whe they have it. They might not can see the screen. I'm not sure if they can see the screen on the camera or not. You might see it. I don't know if it's jumpy or blurry, but anyway, song number 51 of the song book. Glory to his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's see. &gt;&gt; Down at the cross where myior died. Now where for cleansing from sin I cried. There to my heart was the blood of life. Gloryy to his name. Oh sing glory to his wonderful name. Glory to that matchless name. into my heart was the blood of blood. Glory to his name. Well, I am so gorgeously saved from Jesus so sweetly alive with him. There at the cross where he took me in. Glory to his name. I'm singing gloryy to his wonderful name. Glory to that matchless name. To my heart goes the blood of glory to his name. Well, oh precious fountain that sees from sin. I am so glad I have entered in there. Jesus saves me and keeps me clean. Glory to his name. Oh, singing glory to his wonderful name. Glory to that fashionless name. There to my heart was the blood of God. Glory to his name. Welcome to this mountain so riches. Cast out your soul at the Savior's feet. launch into the bee. Glory to his name. I'm singing glory to his wonderful name. Glory to that matchless name. And to my heart was the blood of God. Glory to his name. I'm singing all glory to his wonderful name. Glory to that matchless name. There my heart was the blood of God. Glory to his name. Praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord God. Glory to that precious name. The name of Jesus. Amen. That precious, wonderful name. That name Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but every time I say it, it just makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just like saying Jesus. It just makes you feel good. And so it makes me feel good inside. Every time I call that precious name, &gt;&gt; that name Jesus, it means so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. First time that name was spoke, a baby came back to life. That's right. &gt;&gt; That ought to tell you something right there. Amen. Hallelujah. I tell you, it brings life in me. It seems like every time I say it, too. Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. The name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. You love him today? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Does anyone have a testimony or something on your heart you'd like to thank the Lord Jesus for? &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord for his fil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Anyone else? Amen. Wonderful. Praise the Lord. Look at that heart. That's just man. Like brother Dennis prayed, you have a heart for others so that they can see Jesus. Amen. Like like we do. She said, "That's just beautiful." &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, that's just just a a real heart for wanting someone to see Jesus like you do. &gt;&gt; That's uh that that's something that the world just can't match today, saints. They just don't know anything about &gt;&gt; being able to live for others and having that in your heart. God bless you. That's wonderful. So I had to see the words. So what I did is I walked to his door and Ius &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But God is still faithful. &gt;&gt; God is still true. &gt;&gt; Still right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; I couldn't hear her testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She uh uh in her job there was a lady had called out sick. So she was taking care of a I guess a wing or an area and a man who was in there uh was a patient very foul mouth and she sat outside his door in Jesus name for him to &gt;&gt; stop that and she went in the door and he couldn't speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He couldn't talk. So, I hope I got that from the distance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't know what to say. Walked in and praise the Lord. Do that every morning on the job, too. &gt;&gt; Guys, I'm with they they can be they can be foulmouthed, but they're not like what you're talking about. They're they're not constant all the time. every other word. So, it's a little more tolerable. It's way more tolerable when they're someplace else and I'm doing something else. So, but anyway, Lord knows. Amen. &gt;&gt; Power of prayer. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Let's go over to u I'm going to go ahead and uh delve into this today. Um maybe the Lord willing, we'll see how the Lord brings this up. He gave me uh several scripture things to speak on. Uh I want to if if I could even before we get to that point, uh I want to turn your attention not to turn to right now, but turn your attention uh maybe even through the week at uh Matthew chapter 25. Uh I'm not saying turn to that now. That's not what we're going to talk about right now. But um Matthew 25 and the uh the uh exhortation that we got from the prophet of God and from the scripture. Of course, he takes it from the scripture that to watch out when you start seeing uh the nominal Christians going after that oil. Amen. When those nominal Christians are starting to go after that oil, you know that's when God takes his bride home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's about to be an explosion in this country, even in this world. I heard in the UK and London. It was hundreds of thousands of people that turned out in honor of Charlie Kirk and honestly was just a man. But uh but the but the whole fervor of this is uh Christ and the word and being a Christian and um and when when that great of a fervor is washing through because we know there's not going to be a revival. The revival is over. bride. The only revival is the bride's revival, right? &gt;&gt; As far as a nationwide sweeping revival, that is not going to happen. And you see even in other countries outside of this nation that &gt;&gt; that uh is starting to gain a fervor. And &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest with you, I think his death is going to uh energize uh energize that in people uh more and more. So, um, I I think Matthew 25 is a is a good scripture to learn to to look into to see what's about to happen and what's going on in the world today. &gt;&gt; Amen. What what is happening uh in the world. In fact, let's go um I want to turn in the scripture to second Peter uh second Peter and I want to read a couple of verses of scripture. This uh today probably won't be be very lengthy but I am fully depending on the Lord to speak whatever he wants to say today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I have a couple of scriptures I want to read, but I just have to be honest since uh since some of these things has been happening. Uh it's just been boiling in my spirit and uh things that the Lord has been pointing out, I've just tried to pay attention to and um so I trust that whatever he wants to say today, it's it's it's up to him. I heard I heard again I I don't mean to keep giving accolades to uh to Charlie, but um I heard that a good friend of his said every time he went out to speak in front of people, which he had a lot of interaction on college campuses and stuff, he'd have them come and ask questions and just open debate. Uh he said every time before he came out to speak, he would pray and ask God to give him the words to say that he might be able to help somebody in some way turn to Christ. And you know, I think to myself, uh that's the same prayer I have when I come here every time we have service. So uh it means a lot to understand and know that uh your words have purpose. They have meaning. Uh there's a reason that God puts people in your lives. There's a reason God gives you gifts and things for you to be able to accomplish. So this isn't to all together outside of our uh our subject lately, which has been on adoption because that purpose, that point, that reason uh falls on every one of us. Uh like Madison uh in and her testimony to be able to speak to people and get in contact that she hadn't in a long time to be able to help share Christ. It just &gt;&gt; uh is just tremendous. Uh but um uh I I I want us I want to start today with this scripture reading uh in second Peter chapter 3. But before we do, let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, God, we're just here at your beckoning. We're here, God, to do your will. Whatever you'd have for us today, God, it's in your hands. Lord, we u we're just depending on you as always and trusting you and believing, Father, that you are taking complete control of this service &gt;&gt; and speaking to us as you always will know that your word will not return void. &gt;&gt; But accomplish in each one of us that that you sent it forth for. Lord, we just commit ourselves to you. I pray again. Lord, as I say here now, as I just said to the congregation, Lord, shut my lips to anything that I should not say, open them, Lord, and freely speak through these lips whatever you'd have for us to hear today. &gt;&gt; And may you get the glory and the praise for it all. We commit this service to you now on the remaining part of it. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Second Peter 3:1. This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance, that uh that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandments of us apostles of the Lord uh of the Lord and Savior, knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts, and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. You can be seated if you like. Pardon me. Notice here Peter is first of all making sure that he's giving an exhortation to the people of something that they would already know. uh stirring up their minds by the way of remembrance, stirring them up by remembrance. You know, sometimes as humans uh things kind of get pushed off to the side, things kind of get pushed into the back of our minds. And you know, today in this age of uh technology and all, we're bombarded with voices. We're bombarded with words. We're bombarded with information all the time, continuously coming into our into our minds, into our brains, into our ears, uh creating all kinds of things, emotions and feelings and things that happen in our in our uh uh in our bodies and our spirits uh that uh that have an effect on our lives. So Peter wanted to make sure to uh that they understood that this exhortation was something to stir up their minds. Bring back take back from the far back regions of their minds and throw it back up into the forefront. I know that's very carnal and hor probably horribly wrong as far as if you talk to a someone who knows the brain, but uh in my poor way of explaining it, that's all I know to say. You take that from the way that's in the back far reaches. Maybe things you've forgotten, things that may not have been. And we stir them up by bringing into remembrance those things because those things are as important as anything else that we know, anything else that we've heard, anything else that we've ever been a part of. uh are those things that the that we know that has come to us through the word through as as well Peter said word mindful of the words that were before us brought before us by the holy prophets. Amen. The word of God we just know it as the word of God. Of course those that were men that were moved by the Holy Ghost to write this word uh to bring that word to us so many times uh gets uh gets pushed back but it's brought to our remembrance. And the remembrance he's wanting to bring to them now is knowing knowing Amen. First, knowing this first that there shall come in the last days. Now, Peter uh uh the prophets here understood a good bit about what the last days were. If you read through uh Paul's writings even into revelation what Peter said, what John said, what Jude said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um is all those things that bring back in or bring forward into a point that we are now living in which is the last days. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Uh I've said before and I will say again that to me I believe this is the last of the last days. &gt;&gt; In fact, I believe this is the last moment of the last day of the last days. Uh I don't know how much closer we can bring that up to a realization to us, but uh as Peter said today, something again has been stirring in me to bring to your remembrance uh things that we know what the scripture says, but bring into remembrance what we're what the day that we're living, the hour that we're living, the time that we're living, and these are the last days. And he's wanting to remind us that it has been told through the scripture that in this last days that there would be scoffers. Amen. People that scoff at the word. People that would scoff at Christians. People that would scoff at your beliefs. Uh uh walking after their own lusts. Amen. So they're scoffing at you, but they're walking after their own lusts. It comes a time where it's a very pitiful place to where uh a a group of people and I will say a group of people because there's it seems to be to me that there's probably been a stirring of maybe a millions of people I hate to say it that way because I hope that's not true that actually celebrate uh this poor girl getting killed on that trail that rail system in Charlotte that celebrated uh Charlie Kirk getting murdered. uh people that I've heard of and seen and and even people in prominent positions, people of authority, people who are even at schools teaching young people, people that are in uh positions of of uh of government and have a a position to be able to make and write laws and to be able to celebrate this or somehow blame a very innocent girl for her own murder. murder or an innocent man for his own murder. I I hate to think that there's that many people out there that feel that way, &gt;&gt; but we do know that in the last days there will be scoffers. Now, that we talk about in the religious realm. So, that kind of puts uh uh the greater emphasis on the one that espoused Christianity, but uh the the scoffers, but they're walking after their own lusts. So, what are their own lusts there? Well, a lot of their lusts are to get rid of you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh, one of their greatest lust. Now, I know when people talk about lust, they talk about man and a woman or man on man or whatever the filthiness, but uh, but there is a greater lust than that. U, there's a lust of murder. There's a lust of vengeance. There's a lust of uh, of of really getting rid of you. Uh there's people out there that believe that they are justified. The Bible says they would be uh they would be thinking they're doing the right thing by killing you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh and and sadly, that's where humanity has come. But I want us to focus on understanding that yes, we've known that this was going to happen. But I want us to focus this morning to the understanding that friends, we're not looking at something to come. We're looking at something that's here. and acknowledge it and recognize it and call it out for what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's two spirits working in this world today. And let me tell you, evil in this world, Satan's in. Now, remember, this is not God's economy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're pilgrims and strangers. Uhhuh. Charlie was a pilgrim and a stranger. As a Christian, we're all as Christians, pilgrims and strangers. This is not our economy. This is not God's economy. This is Satan's Eden. This world went into the hands of Satan. And this economy belongs to him. Now, the earth, the rightful place of the earth itself, which is God's creation, belongs to him again. Amen. And he's going to take care of that one day. We know. But in this economy that we live, there's those two spirits that are working, saints. And the evil in this world is growing greater and greater exponentially. We talked about a minute ago where the spirit of God is moving among people and even the nominals out there are feeling that move and feeling that fervor and feeling that uh that that spirit moving and they see what's going on and they want to do something to combat that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we recognize that the evil the forces of evil in this world are gaining such ground. Amen. And uh as much as you would say the the one side is not uh is not violent. Uh the one side that's the Christian, that's the nominal, that's the going after that oil, the ones that's desiring to live a Christian life and to spread the gospel. These people are not violent, &gt;&gt; right? But you got to understand the other side is very violent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They are their hatred has burned so hot that they celebrate a human life being taken. Human life, human life has become so devalued today. And the scripture said it would. Well, I got another scripture I want to read. But human life has become so devalued today that people will celebrate when someone else is murdered or killed. I don't care who it is. I I don't care how much you disagree. I don't I even Look, I disagree with the president, Donald Trump. I I I like him as a president. I think he's a great president. Uh I think he's evolved into a decent man. I think he was at one time not very much a very good man, but uh he's been a I think I believe a great president. But I disagree with him wholeheartedly when he come out asking for the death penalty for this young man. I do not agree in the death penalty. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham did not agree with the death penalty. &gt;&gt; Uh that's the taking of a life and that's not up to you to do. &gt;&gt; It's not up for us to do as a government. Amen. It's not up for us to do as a judicial system to take another person's life. We still do it. Amen. And as much as that is wrong, I hate the thought of somebody like that living off of my tax dollars for the next 50 years. But uh it is wrong to take life &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; value life. Life is so precious. Brother Ram said life is so precious. God records every one of them in a book. &gt;&gt; Even though they weren't ones that were to be predestined in his mind in the Lamb's book of life. But he records every life. Everyone that's born. That's how precious life is to God. Every every person has a soul that's worth 10 million worlds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how to devalue that down to something that you can just take as target practice is beyond me. I I I I just don't get it. I hear a lot of people screaming and yelling about taking guns out of people's hands. Once you take the guns out of people's you can't Well, first of all, you'll never do it &gt;&gt; right. uh if you take the guns out of the uh respectable law-abiding people, all the people that have guns are the crooks, criminals, and murderers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you it won't happen. You can't do it. But if you were to do it, you become you become a citizenry that is defenseless. Amen. Against any crooked government or whatever that would want to rise up. But they want to take all this. But that's not the problem. The problem is that I've had guns my entire life. And I'm sorry if this gets a little political. I I don't think it should because we're talking about life in the word, right? &gt;&gt; But I've had guns my whole life. Since I was a little boy, I've had guns my whole life. Not one of my guns has ever hurt anybody except maybe me when I was a little kid. Tried to shoot it and bruised my shoulder. I guess that hurt me. But none of my guns have ever killed anybody. Nobody. I still got guns today. They've never killed anybody. Right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're in my hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. Problem is not the gun. The problem's a person's heart. How if you take all the guns out, how are you going to take the evil out of people's hearts? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I've had people that are right that are that are actually relatives of mine. I hate guns. They say, "Well, I hate guns, too." In the hands of a wicked, evil person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hate a car in the hands of a wicked person. I hate a knife in the hands of a wicked person. I hate a bomb in the hands of a wicked person. I I hate all the chemicals that a person can use to make a bomb in the hands of a wicked person. I hate all this stuff in the hands of a wicked person. A person we've had people that push others out on the uh uh uh out on the to the subway rails for the subway to run over them, kill them. We was that a gun? We've had people drive their cars through parades, kill six, eight, ten people. We've had people, this this uh young guy the other day plunged that knife in the neck of that poor girl. That wasn't a gun, but it was evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wickedness. And that's the whole point I'm making. It's the wickedness. It's the evil that's taking over this that this world and it's continuing to and it will continue to because again remember I'm not trying to paint a bleak picture of the world that we live in saints but we know what reality is as Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know before the sixth seal before the tribulation sets in in Armageddon the bride will be gone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride will be gone. But the evil is starting to manifold itself more and more all the time. And unfortunately, it seems like the greatest indoctrinated group is becoming the young people. &gt;&gt; And if this generation is getting to that point, what do you think the next one's going to be? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If they're getting more and more indoctrinated away from God, whatever else the indoctrination takes them to, murder, whatever, hatred, that's one thing. but taking them away from God. And see, people want to talk about I hear this word root causes all the time. Root causes. We want to have root causes. Let's find root cause. Let's go to the root cause. Let's get the root cause of what the problem is. And they never find what the root cause. You know what the root cause is? We turned our back on God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what the root cause is. Root cause is when you turn your back on Jesus Christ, there's nothing left but death. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what they've done. &gt;&gt; Right. When you turn your back on God, there's nothing left. And that's what humanity has done. That's what this country has done. So where are we at today? We're living in a place where yes, you've got this great group of people that again, I'll call them nominal Christian. I don't know every one of them. I don't know their place. I don't know their position. This may be a stirring. You know what? This could be a stirring that's going on that's just getting started to me a after this last murder. I think it's just getting started. This stirring could be the thing that drives some people to it. It might drive the last seed in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know what happens when that last seed comes in. &gt;&gt; The bride goes home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it could be something that actually even drives the last seed in that is a part of the bride to get to that place. I mean when I was a kid we were Baptists. I don't know what you were what religion or if you were atheists but when I was a kid we were Baptists. So I personally myself uh I was young very young but came out of that denomination. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you did but everybody starts somewhere. So we don't know that last person. It could be that last seed. This this right now could be the thing that brings that last seed in. &gt;&gt; We don't know. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the greater work I see I see happening is this that I again call nominal stirring up to the place that they're going. And when and we know that the scripture says when they go after that that's when the bridegroom comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when the bridegroom comes. And that's uh a a word uh the scripture that I do want to read that to us too. But I want to read one more scripture before we get to that one. Uh in second Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter 3 is a very familiar scripture reading I'm sure to all of us. Amen. Second Timothy 3 verse one. This know also that in the last days here we go again saying the last days. We acknowledge that, right? We we accept that. We believe that. We know that that's talking to us. Perilous time shall come. You know what perilous means? &gt;&gt; Dangerous. Amen. Savagery times, hatred, perilous times, un un uh unthinkable, unknowable. Um uh perilous is is uh unstable. Amen. Dangerous. Savage. You know what a savage is? A savage is a person that is is brutal and vicious. Now, if you want to think about brutal and vicious, look at what happened to just a couple in couple instances just this week that we know of &gt;&gt; that we saw publicized, videoed. Amen. Not not to mention some of the others in a lot of these high crime cities that goes on all the time. Murders every week, every weekend. Killings, murders every week. But look at this this couple of times. savages. I mean, who gets up behind a little defenseless girl behind her and from behind plunges a knife into her neck? And who else will sit there? I mean, how bad can it be after watching blood gushing out of this girl's neck that you can sit there and do nothing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What day are we living, saints? &gt;&gt; Yes. What is going on in this world? What is happening to people? Perilous times, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's perilous times. That person probably didn't want to get up because they were afraid it might happen to them. Dangerous, savagery, brutal, dangerous, vicious people. Amen. That's why you must have the shield of God around you at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watching over you. But who does that? I who climbs up on a roof and just for no re basically what we can tell no reason at all just because he disagreed with it. You know, I mean I if we shoot people we disagree with I might as well shoot myself now because I disagree with myself fairly often. Amen. I do stuff and I look back and I think why in the world would you do that? That didn't make any sense. Why did you say that? I mean why did you think that I do that to myself much less other people? I might as well kill myself. Now, if you're going to shoot if you're going to shoot people you disagree with, we're all going to be dead, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, that's what eventually is going to happen anyway. But we're all going to be dead. We'll all be shot. We'll all be killed. We'll all somehow be murdered. Amen. Because that's the place. Vicious. See, savagery, brutal. That's where it's become. Perilous. Perilous times. Men shall be lovers. Humanity, shall I say, not just men, humanity shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy. What a place we have. &gt;&gt; Unholy. And we have such a holy God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without natural affection. That that one seems to be taking greater hold in this world than anything right now. Amen. Is unnatural affection. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Which is could be one of the bottom lines behind the shooting this week. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unnatural affection. I know. I know it had something to do with the those poor kids that got shot up to that Catholic church. That guy was such a coward. He didn't even go inside the church. &gt;&gt; I mean, talk about a horrible individual. He stays outside and blows out the windows just to try to shoot and kill people. I mean, that's just that's just about as cowardly as you can get. Then go squat down outside the parking lot and shoot yourself. That's just but it's it's savagery. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's a murderous intent, idea, thought, try to eradicate anything that's not like you, anything that disagrees with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But dar said, "Now I don't I don't I don't want to don't get me wrong, please. I'm not trying to say that Charlie is Jesus Christ." But the same thing happened to Jesus Christ. Amen. The devil want had him in his sights the whole time. Kill him, murder him, take his take his life. And he finally got him and he hung him on the cross. Of course, Jesus didn't hang him. Jesus laid down his life. No man could take it. &gt;&gt; But he laid down his life. But the celebration in hell began and Satan was happy. Little did he know what he had unleashed by killing Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Little did he know what he had unleashed. Now he doesn't just have Jesus to deal with. He's got millions, millions of believers, millions of people that follow him. Amen. I told you about that spider in I tell you about that spider in Florida that time uh that I heard about these big tree spiders in Florida that come and they fall off the trees and get in your house. They're hard to exterminate them. But there was one lady had on her wall in her kitchen is big old the legs are just big. They're harmless. Uh but it's a spider. But they don't hurt you. But this woman saw one on the wall in her kitchen. She smacked it uh with a roll of paper or something and Did she know there was a sack of babies under that woman, under that mother? And when she smacked that spider, she killed the mama, but she spread hundreds of little babies all over the place. She had to fumigate the house because there spiders everywhere. Hundreds of them went all over the place. Amen. That's what Satan tries to do. He might smack one, but what he did is he just he just uh I don't say enraged, but encouraged and brought about the fervor of those thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Amen. And now he's got them all stirred up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now what happens there? He's in for it. Amen. He knows he's in for it now. my mind. Unholy, without natural affection. Said that. Amen. Truth breakers, false accusers, incontinent, which means unable, fierce, and despisers of those that are good. Despisers of those that are good. Amen. I don't know about the girl on the on the the rail train, but the the the one kid shot up all those people in that church. Amen. This guy shot and killed a person that expoused Christianity as much as anybody probably that I know anyway. Amen. espouse Christianity and Jesus Christ and being godly and being a Christian and the principles of a good family life and having a mother and a father and uh things that seem to be out of sorts today for people uh but they hate them for it. They they despisers of those that are good, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Confused people in this world who are getting confused. uh doctors telling them things, teachers telling them things, people telling them things that they shouldn't that that young minds shouldn't be exposed to, uh telling them raising and say, "Uh, well, well, my child's born, they can decide whether they're a boy or a girl." And who does? That's just evil. &gt;&gt; And look at them and tell them, you know, well, are you a boy or a girl? You say, "Well, I don't know. Maybe today I'll be a boy. I don't know. Tomorrow I'll be a girl." You know, and they get so they get so they're not equipped. Humans, first of all, much less little kids, their brains aren't equipped to try to accept and receive and process that kind of knowledge that that thought process and they get all confused and it I imagine it becomes very depressing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And very hard to what what do I do from here? You know, am I a boy? Am I a girl? what what uh they become so confused and they they don't know what to do and their life gets becomes a pure mess and then they become despisers of those that are good. Amen. Because that whole thing is evil to begin with. Amen. Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof from such turn away. For of this s sort are they which crept into houses and led captive silly women laden with sin led away with divers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Janice and Jammers withtood Moses so do these also resist the truth. Men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith. Reprobate. Amen. That means they're uh vile, uh disgusting, a reprobate, someone who is who is uh gone off on to the the nastiness, the filthiness, the the ungodly. Amen. Not not to return even not not to return apostasy, if you will. But they shall proceed no further, for their folly shall be made manifest unto all men, as theirs was also. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lististra, uh what persecutions I endured. But out of them all, the Lord delivered me. Praise God. Yay. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse. Deceiving and being deceived. Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times a person has to be deceived first before they can be deceiving. They have to first be deceived by someone before they are deceiving others. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have to first be deceived. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast uh learned them. And from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine, for reprove, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Thoroughly furnished against the word that comes forth. Remember, faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. Amen. Hearing the word of God. Today, in a great way, our values are under attack. Yes. &gt;&gt; The way that we believe and the things that we hold dear are under attack by a whole another sect of people, possessed people, I will say, that want to eradicate anything that is godly or like God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or espouses God or projects God or tries to help others find God. They want to eradicate, kill it, do away with it. And they celebrate that fact even if it comes at the expense of a human life. Matthew 25. I want to read this. I'll close here in just a minute. Where are we at when human life has devolved &gt;&gt; to the place of a senseless murder like that like those? But where are we even worse when there's people that are happy about it &gt;&gt; and celebrate it not just to themselves but to the world, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They'll get on a platform, this social media, and share it with the entire world that they're happy that this person died. I saw an interview of someone that said, "I wished I had done it." &gt;&gt; I mean, you you talk about a humanity that's devolved that is become so devalued where it doesn't it means nothing anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. When a person gets to the point that they think that uh that your life means nothing, that's a sad that's a sad state that we're in. But look, in the evil, remember the two spirits, those things are still working. Brother Brandham talked about that. Go look the two spirits that come up all the way through the scripture. They're they started with Cain and Abel still going. Those same those two spirits. Amen. And I will just simply call them good and evil. I I mean that's a simplistic way of saying it. That's just the way it basically is. You got good and you got evil. And those two spirits are there. But I want to focus for this last little bit on the good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 25 verse one. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise, five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. Remember that. But they're all but they're still virtuous. Remember, they're still virtuous. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried. So it wasn't just something that you felt. It wasn't just a tingling on your flesh. You actually had an indwelling presence of the spirit of Christ in you. Amen. Not just an anointing like the what? Like the foolish. The foolish have an anointing. Absolutely. They have that anointing. That anointing makes them shout and scream and dance and worship and cry and all the emotions that go along with a lot of worship that we know that true genuine worship is the same in there as they're anointed of that Holy Spirit. But that anointing only goes on the flesh. You read back in Acts two. Amen. When they got the Holy Spirit, it wasn't just on them, but it was in them. Amen. There's a difference. And the wise had oil in their lamps and in their vessels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the foolish now, but the wise took fourth verse. Let me continue to read this. The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom carried, they all slumbered and slept. All of them were asleep. That's why I said, "Bride, wake up." &gt;&gt; And at midnight there was a cry made. Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him. All the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. Amen. They all prepared themselves. But what was the defining factor? It wasn't what they could do with their with their bodies or with their flesh, but were they born again? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Did they have Christ living in them? Had they gone to the new birth? And the foolish said unto the wise, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out." But the wise answered, saying, "Not so, lest there," now remember this is just a parable. The wise answered, saying, "Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you. But go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves." And while they went to buy, while the foolish virgin went to seek for that oil. Amen. When they went to buy, the bridegroom came. That's when the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, we're looking for our loved ones to appear any times, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in prayer and after prayer and during prayer a lot of times is uh probably more than others when my spiritual eye becomes open to think could it be today? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Could it be right now? When I open my eyes, is my family going to be standing in front of me? Is my mom, my dad, my son, are they going to be there? Because we're that close. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. I I don't know how I express that any any better. I'm actually kind of surprised, although it may come in the near future. I'm actually kind of surprised at this point that the Pope hasn't had something to say about uh this murder. Uh I I'm I'm kind of surprised, not that he wouldn't in the near future, it would surprise it would not surprise me if something was said or brought as an official statement or from him personally uh about this situation. But notice when the bridegroom comes is when the foolish virgin is going after that oil, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And if this move, and I'll say if because I don't know for sure, but it sure looks that way. The the way people are fired up now and fired up about Christ and fired up about the word. uh if they are at that place that they're that they're gathering together and having uh these as they call them revival or whatever going after that oil. Uh then we're living in scriptural time. We already know the last days. We already know that we're in the last days, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But when they went to go by, the bridegroom came, right? &gt;&gt; The bridegroom came for the five wise virgins. the bride. He came to take her home while they were out looking for that oil. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What time are we living now? &gt;&gt; What time are we in? Cuz I'll be honest that this is the first thought that came to my mind when I saw a lot of this stuff unfolding and developing. This is the first thing that came to my mind. They might that God might have silenced one voice, but I think all he did was unleash millions of other voices that are going to start crying out now and louder and more bolder and uh greater than than it's probably been maybe in my lifetime even I'll say. Now, what has that done? Well, you look in the nominal world. You look you look in the nominal world and you see the thing that they're the stirring that's going on. What is that thing that they're that they're looking for that they're going after? Well, brother Brandham, Brother Brandham in a couple of places talked to us about how when that nominal church goes after that oil, when that nominal church goes after that oil, the bridegroom comes, the bride's going home. &gt;&gt; Yes. So if all these all these things are evolving in front of us, uh the pope from America, I mean I we could go on for the next 30 minutes, but the point is we know all these things that have been happening and prophecy being fulfilled and scripture being fulfilled and things that's unfolding in front of us is bringing us to this point now. What what sort of people ought we to be &gt;&gt; in all holiness? Amen. And righteousness. What kind of people ought we to be now more than ever? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like Madison said, if you want I if you want to try to talk to somebody about Jesus Christ and get them in, now's the time to do it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now's the time to try to spread that and let the people know that that Jesus Christ is Lord. &gt;&gt; He's your savior and receive him. This now's the time to do it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this I I all this happening is just is not coincidental. Uh prophecy again being fulfilled. Scripture being fulfilled. Is this that? I don't know. But it sure looks like this is going to create something that's going to bubble over now. Amen. And bring us to this this point in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. I' look if you have any loved ones in past in Christ that have gone on before, look for them, saints. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they'll be per you before you at any time. Any time. While they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut just like it was on Noah's ark. Afterward came also the other virgins saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But it now look, it doesn't say they actually got the oil. Amen. There nowhere in the scripture says they went to go get it, but nowhere in the scripture does it say they actually got it. Amen. They still were depending on that anointing. But look, when this bride leaves, that anointing leaves, there's nothing of God left. He'll be dealing with the Jews, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's nothing left. them. What do they have? Their testimony. That's all they'll have left, their testimony. Brother Bam said they'll have to seal their testimony with their blood. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin does. While they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they were they that were ready with went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. Afterward, came also the other virgin, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. And he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. Now, this is not the same where he told them, "I never knew you." Amen. As in, "I never had relation or never had fellowship with you." This is I'm ignoring you. Amen. I've turned uh this probably sounds crude, but I've turned my back to you. I'm not listening to you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? They had their chance, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They had their chance to get what the wise virgin had, and they didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Now, what have we got? The bride has gone home, and the world falls into apostasy. I know you not. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh, what day or hour that we're in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch therefore and pray. &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't know the day or the hour, but friend, I believe the bride knows the season. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we're in that season right now. &gt;&gt; We know that season is the last days, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we're in the end of the last days. How much longer can this go? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How much longer can it survive? How much how much longer can it exist in this state? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's hard to know. Get into Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get into Christ. &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Spirit. Be born again. Anything you've ever done, be born again with his spirit. &gt;&gt; Peter gave us that uh he just gave us Peter gave us that uh recipe on the day of Pentecost. Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's our promise. That's our promised land. We know that the Lord has promised that to us living in this evil world, living in this evil land. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh I'm not here to try to paint especially for our precious Madison who's so young uh paint a horrible picture, but friend to the bride that's a beautiful picture. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; I mean the bride, the worse the world gets, the closer we are to going home. That's just scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's it's not a matter of saying that um this world is a horrible place. I think we've kind of all got to the understanding to know that with everything that's going on and and all just as we know and how much of it we don't know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God have mercy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, &gt;&gt; you see in the coming days when all this starts stirring, it's already stirring. Amen. You see it continue to stir and gain a greater fervor. We're at that time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; My opinion, we're at that time, s &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the bride of Jesus Christ is going home to be with her, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so looking forward to that. Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we could. I wanted to bring that. I wanted to bring that realization and what I felt in my heart that the Lord I felt the Lord showed me of what's about to take place, what's beginning to unfold. Can we uh this evening time? I want to sing this course and then recognize we are in the evening time. Darkness grows darkness to people. But at the evening time there shall be light. And we are in that light. We are that light because Christ is that light. And Christ is in us shining forth that light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's sing this. It is the evening time, saints. We're about ready to go home. Amen. This is the evening time. It's later than you think. The bride is preparing now for her Lord to me. All things are ready now. The bridegroom I hear. He that has an ear to hear the evening time is here. The God of this evil age has blinded the eyes today of people who walk their own way not according to God's word denying the things he's done of sending his only son, accepting the creeds of men, rejecting the word of God. Yes, this is the evening time. It's later than you think. The bride is preparing now for her Lord to me. All things are ready now. The bridegroom I hear. He that has an ear to hear. The evening time is here. There's darkness throughout this land. This world just can't understand. A prophet has walked this land proclaiming the way to God. If you would be saved today, then follow the words he gave. Believing the word of God. This is the evening time. Yes, this is the evening time. It's later than you think. The bride is preparing now for her Lord to meet. All things are ready now. The bridegroom I hear. He that has an ear to hear. The evening time is here. Yes. He that has an ear to hear that evening time is here. Oh, it's here, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's anything we can do to help the kingdom of God, we should do it now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is there anything we can do for God and for his kingdom? Let's do it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know there's maybe a handful of people, I don't know, God knows that's still out there. It's hard. People don't want to listen. &gt;&gt; They've turned their back on God. They've turned into scoffers turning their back on God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Jesus laid down his life knowing that all of humanity would need it, but realizing that very few would ever accept it. &gt;&gt; But he did it anyway. I want to be I am one of those few. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And if there's any others that we can help to bring in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And make ourselves make sure ourselves we are ready. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now is the time. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it is the evening time, saints. Amen. It is later than all of us could imagine. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you today. I pray something was said to bless and strengthen you, Lord. Just keep us, help us. We have time. If the Lord carries through the week and give us grace through the week and bless each one of you and jobs and whatever the Lord has for you and just bless you richly. Remember, Lord willing, next week, next Sunday, uh plan on having the Lord's supper and footwashing. So, please keep that in your heart and mind. Next Sunday, we'll have the Lord's supper and foot washing here at the church. Amen. So, God bless you. I think that was the only announcement I had. Anybody else have anything before anything? Amen. Again, please remember these requests. Amen. Those that we mentioned and brought before you our church and not in our church, but a part uh that we just have compassion, empathy, and love for humanity. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
