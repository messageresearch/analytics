i'm thankful for this country i like brother zach and thankful for all the men and women down through the ages who have given their lives who've given their last measure of devotion the ultimate

verse 13. first thessalonians 4 13 we'll continue on with the rapture message here today amen spy our heads for a word of prayer if we could you feeling okay sister shrine glad to have you back but if we can keep her in prayer she's still in pain she's taking her uh days where she goes in for the therapy monday wednesday and friday but yeah she's still in quite a bit pain brother okay thank you certainly thank you absolutely i helped brother roger move up uh probably 600 500 600 every time i tell the story the piano gets heavier but i think he gets heavier to the the same piano is heavier now at 55 than it was at 25. uh but it helped him move a piano he got a place down in sierra vista to hold services so we moved 37 of those heavy blue chairs like at the tabernacle and um and a piano in there and it was just so heavy i got home friday night i couldn't hardly move my back was hurting so bad i tried to lay in bed for a little bit before i go to sleep and it just wasn't working i just went and told sonia i'm going to bed and it hurts so bad and i got up yesterday after prayer and not a good night's rest and the lord touched me and yesterday and today feel perfectly fine amen and i i don't mind telling you after friday night um it it was rough i'll just put it that way i don't want to give a negative testimony but it was hurting pretty bad but the lord touched and i'm so thankful so we'll remember sister shariah and prayer too as we pray now so let's buy our heads we approach the word of the author of the word today precious jesus we're so thankful god again that you blessed us with another beautiful day with life and health and strength our bodies mind spirit soul and for all that you do for us lord we're eternally grateful we thank you so much lord for the opportunity to live in a country that affords us the freedoms that we have to stand here in a public facility and worship and call on the name of jesus christ without fear of being imprisoned or or even death lord god we thank you father and pray that you'd help those who may be in countries your bride lord who may be in countries who are facing those threats every day may your hand be upon them bless them lord afford them the opportunity to be able to get together in some way god when when the enemy come into elisha lord you you blinded their eyes that they couldn't even see he was elisha i believe elijah i do i believe you do the same thing for those those saints those brothers and sisters around the world who may be in those conditions lord they may be worshipping serving you living for you being in public service lord may the authorities come in and not even see what's going on just be blinded lord to the service it's going for you lord and for your glory and honor for your from your people and god i pray that you bless this service now as we committed to you and pray your holy spirit would have the preeminence once again we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and honor for all that is said and done lord i pray that you touch shariah now father we've been praying for of course fervently father since um heard about these back issues but we're believing now in the name of jesus christ that a touch from your mighty hand your healing hand god to go where she is right now in that back row lord and touch her and heal her and take that pain from her make her perfectly well father as we know that you are the miracle-working great physician who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities and there's probably never been a person ever lived god that ever suffered a backache like you did so you can certainly lord feel her infirmity today may you bless it god bless her bless your family bless each one lord bless those who may be streaming today may your hand be upon them as well as we just commit the reading part of the service into your hands and give you praise honor and glory in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen in first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 we'll begin reading but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then which uh also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are our sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven from heaven with a shout with a voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort you one another with these words you could be seated if you'd like amen we're continuing on with the rapture message this is part five amen and i trust that whatever the what the lord put in my heart last week was a blessing to you the lord just multiplied it to your hearts and just pray it helped you to understand and realize the position that we were coming from on this record that we're talking about and understanding this rapture i want to try to uh try to hit every facet of this rapture i want to try to in integrate every part of of this even though we may know it even though it may be very common to us i want to be able to because there may be some watch this and don't know but i want to integrate every part of it and last week and understanding about the message and the prophet and and the five times of elijah and the things that the lord shows us to understand that this that what this rapture is how it's going to take place i was going to say when but we don't know when right and who's going to be in it right who is it for what this rapture is for and again i believe that this rapture is going to be for the bride it's going to be for this last day elect lady uh of course this last day the alive and remain group will be in this last day the bright as we've said come from the first church age all the way down but this last church age for this this word for this message has come for this last day now i wanted to make sure we understood that uh that it wasn't just for us because a lot of times you hear people talk about a rapture and i understand where they're coming from because their point is that they're ministering to the to the group that they have they're ministering to the people that are alive they're ministering to this last day alive and remain group even if some of us may still go by the grave that we're ministering to that group but we do that with an understanding that the bride is from the first church age all the way down yes and it's not just the bride that listens and believes and lives this message of today is each one of those groups that come down through its messenger through its message and through its word for its day yes each one of those amen and those are the ones that god has pulled out now they've gone by the wave of the grave that's going to come up in the first resurrection for the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years and that that those deads that come and raise up will present themselves before the alive and remain bride then for a minimum of 30 days that we'll be together on earth and will be changed and we'll be caught up together to meet the lord in the air do you understand that that rapture is only for the bride yes the rapture is only for the word bride those that are of the message the word of god for this day because that because the word is what uh is what brings the paramount part of each age that came down through and it is that word for their day brother braham said as each one of them lived to their message they're the ones that will be there well those that live to their message for this day those are the ones that are going to be there i want to make that point very clear yes i wanted to make that point very profound and and that we understand that and that it it comes in our hearts clear like that i forgot to start my recording here but um it reminded me too that um micah had sent me a text i wanted him to read it but he's already sat down i'm going to read it to you it's the text that he sent me after the message sunday uh i i believe that the lord's put a gift on micah's heart and so many times he'll he'll uh send me things to expound on some things the lord has been dealing with and i'll just read it exactly how he typed he says you can't know the lord and his word by knowledge which is what we talked about but by revelation inspiration and spending time with him just like any relationship you don't know a person until you spend time with them now think of this listen very closely this is uh it's very poignant here just like any relationship you don't know a person until you spent time with them and if you sit here and you're married you know how very profound that is yeah you think you know somebody a lot of times especially when you get married you think you know somebody and you don't really know that person until you live with them until you really spend time with them as we'd say quality time or an extended time uh in a home in a setting where it's intimate amen because a lot of things happen in our lives and around people and in church and supermarkets and everywhere else that that that doesn't happen at home there's a lot of things that happen at home don't happen in church if you don't really know that person to know that person until you really get to know them to spend time with them sure they could write down their likes dislikes pet peeves and things that they really like but that isn't knowing them see what we talked about the word last week people read the word and they think they know jesus because they read the word remember this is just a part of christ it's just print on a book amen amen to know christ you've got to know him in the power of his resurrection and the spirit that he come that that he brings he comes into you and that relationship now i'm reading this because of that that is the changing point i want to bring to today's message is that relationship yes amen that relationship you won't know uh how they react to certain situations when they're in stress when they're sad or when they make them laugh when someone treats them poorly how do they react or respond uh when they're in a bad mood how should we respond this depth of understanding or revelation of that person is not complete until you spend time with them and reveal and they reveal themselves and their traits and characteristics to you amen that's uh that that's from my son and i thought that was so exceptional that i wanted to read it to you because it brings in what again i wanted to talk about today and that was that relationship see to have that relationship so many people come to church and they think they know jesus so many people think say they give their heart to life their hearts to the lord and they think they know jesus they read the book they read the bible they read it through cover to cover and they think they know jesus they might know this that and the other about him but they don't really know jesus amen and what does it mean to know him because understand friend this bride that we're talking about this group that's going in a rapture is a word bride yes it has to be a word bride because he is the word and if he is the word she has to be the word to have that relationship with him there's no other group there's no other people there's no other uh way that it can come but to understand that we have to become who he is or that relationship is not going to work yeah i mean think about if you try to again i'll i'll talk and express about marriage but if you have a spouse i mean you might have a a relationship with your spouse uh and then go by horse now try to have the same relationship with that horse as you have with your husband or wife go try to get a dog as much as people try to humanize dogs go try to get a dog and have the same relationship you can have with your son or daughter or your or your husband or wife you can't you won't work you might love them to pieces you might love them to death you as the phrase goes you might you might to do anything for them they might offering unconditional love and this that the other but there's no way to have the same type of relationship because they're not human right if they're not human you can't have that same relationship and if this bride is not a word bride how can she have the right kind of relationship with a word groom she can't she has to be the same as he is or there is no relationship yes she must be a word bride yes amen now if she's a word bride then that puts her in the position of of christ and the word themselves that means that she came from the word that's the only way you can be the work is if you're derivative of the word right let's just go back to the very beginning why don't we do that genesis chapter 2. only way to have that relationship is to know that person to know that person intimately amen i told you a couple weeks ago and then of course said last sunday that i wanted to focus on uh and and i found out this week this is probably going to take a couple services for this but that invisible union that invisible union a lot of times people don't really grasp the concept or the understanding of that invisible union what it is to be in a union that is not a tangible physical union tangible physical relationship and it's an invisible union brother brown priest and like tabernacle and shreveport thanksgiving message or one of them uh in 1965 and he preached the invisible union i challenge you to go listen to it almost text this week for everybody to listen to invisible union if you haven't heard it i'm sure some of you have outstanding message but go listen to it take this some time this week and go this is a couple hours but go listen to it it's just a powerful outstanding message and i won't have the time to get into all of it today but i'm you know well what we expound on is going to be a part of that but it will bless you either way so but now let's go back to the beginning here in genesis chapter 2 um well we'll just read it let's just read beginning with verse 21 genesis 2 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs god took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man amen woman because she was taken out of the man she is now born of my bone flesh of my flesh that's his proclamation the god that god created man adam and that was an amateur god here on earth adam and that was his proclamation is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh why because god had taken him her out of him so that makes her a separate entity in the flesh but it makes them one in spirit amen amen because she came out of him therefore shall a man leave his father mother cleveland to his wife and and they shall be one flesh amen they shall be one flesh now flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone is what adam's declaration is here to the woman that he called woman that was taken out of his body the woman that was taken out of his side she now became a living creature because god did to her the same he did with adam but he took out of adam to create her amen understand now she became as he is she became that flesh and bone because she was a part of him she became human she became flesh she became a a woman now god also in the beginning of course when god made man in the first chapter god made man a like himself and god made man like himself and how is god god is a spirit being so when god made man like himself he made man a spirit being and he put in that spirit being both the masculine and feminist spirit so when god then created man into a flesh body in the garden of eden like a tree out of the ground that man had both masculine and feminist spirit to him because that's who god is you say well god has no feminist well then where did it come from he's got to because he poured what he had into us so he took that and he poured that into adam and when he made adam a flesh man he made adam a flesh man with masculine and and feminist spirit spirited him but now when god took from adam and made a woman he took the flesh part of adam and made the woman out of the flesh but he didn't stop there he took the feminist spirit out of adam and put that feminist spirit into the woman so now the man is solely a masculine being and the woman is solely a feminist speak right now you see how the the world is going today in this country that is absolutely in every way doing its very best by demonic's powers to get people away from that gospel truth of the man beginning not a man no you can born chromosomes whatever doesn't make you man the woman is born chromosomes uh lady parts whatever that's that there's they can be a man if they want to be what do you want to be you want to be a boy or a girl it's okay we'll let you decide hogwash amen god decides before the foundation of the world and a man is a man and a woman is a woman yes and he took the woman out of the man and he put the feminist spirit from him into the woman so now he's a flesh body masculine spirit she is a flesh body feminine spirit you understand that was the beginning that was the type of jesus christ coming and and pouring himself into his bride where did this bride come from my friend where did this bride come from this bride came from jesus christ yes who is christ christ is the word amen at calvary god took that woman out of that man god took that bride out of that out of that word out of christ and when jesus ascended on high he sent back the holy spirit the spirit of god to put in each one of us yes oh can we see now what god does what he does people say oh we don't listen to the old testament anymore oh it's so perfectly types and shadows the new testament if we just wouldn't do away with it and just get a spiritual understanding of it yeah get a revelation of what the word is teaching us and telling us god did the exact same thing when he did without him and took the bride out of adam yeah he took a bride out of christ he took the spirit of feminine out of adam and put it in eve god took his holy spirit and he put it in his bride and that holy spirit from the day of pentecost has been flowing down through these church edges that is ever present now more than it ever has been amen yes and it's in us yes the holy spirit is in us it has made us who we are it is made us complete amen the only way that you become word is that you came out of christ that you are filled with his spirit that makes you word amen you understand that makes you word right yes and god is only coming in a rapture for a word bride right you have to have come from him from the beginning that's that part of god that seed that laid in there dormant from before the foundation of the world first john 3 and that seed that remaineth in there is the seed of god and when the word of god in literal spoken form comes and fertilizes that seed it produces life yes what kind of life does it produce it produces the life of the seed that's within it whatever life is in that seed is what it's going to produce yeah some of you here garden or grow flowers or plants or whatever uh brother dennis got a beautiful yard sister pat and them and bro grow beautiful plants and maybe from seedlings seedlings you you have a seed and you may look at a seed you may not know what it is but you put a little water to it and put it in the right kind of condition and it'll bring forth whatever's inside it if there's a seed in you you put it in the right condition and bring your little fertilizer a little uh water the holy spirit the word coming it'll bring that seed to life and when that seed comes life into you it only produces one thing that's what the seed is yes if the seed is god it's going to produce god if it's from the word from the beginning it's that's what it's going to produce and that word now is preeminent in you which makes you a word bride that's where the relationship comes from it's not just reading your bibles i'm not against reading the bible you know better than that right anybody may be watching you should read it every day i'm not against reading your bible you should read your bible but don't read it for knowledge yes right pray that god reveal that word to you pray that word fertilize that spirit that's like this within you and let it cultivate itself and let you die so that that life lives more in you let less of newton bennett live so more of jesus christ can live through you so then you can go out in this world and people can look and see it was written epistles read of all men read and known of all men right it's not an accident that that man looked at brother dennis and thought he was a man of god right that's not an accident and that's just one testimony probably of many and maybe some that you've had that look at you and say oh that that's a christian amen that's good probably further and further away because a lot of times people look and just they don't realize what it is yeah they just see you as a freak or something they don't realize it's god that's uh that that's living in you and through you they don't because they don't recognize that spirit the people have gotten in the in the world economy has gotten so far away from the spirit of god that they don't even recognize him when they see it but we know and there's some still out there they see it and they know they they see us and they recognize there's something different they may not even say anything but there's people they know they recognize it that's right why because you're written epistles read and known of all men because that life that's coming through you that word that's living through you you say well i feel like the same person that doesn't matter it's not i'm not talking about your human flesh or your human flesh your human flesh is going to obey the word too you don't live just however you want to you don't dress just how you want to go wherever you want to your human flesh comes under subjection to the word right amen but it's not that it's the man that's on the inside yes amen the life that's on the inside is what will dictate to the outside that makes that bride a word bride amen look now and the scene is not there with the shock i got some just some really powerful quotes i want to read to you here that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom now there's going to be a transition here that i don't want you to miss because i want you to see in the progression of a relationship uh again that we talked about that relation there's a progression of a relationship when uh i hope well i hope i do offend people if you see it a different way but when a boy and a girl meet uh there's something that sparks and they have a relationship it may be a casual relationship maybe a conversation relationship it may be uh what is it now face timing or whatever they do i i don't know but face timing or uh i don't know what video anyway video chat uh whatever and they may have a little uh a superficial relationship but it's a relationship they're getting to know one another and then all of a sudden they decide hey i want to be your girlfriend well that's good because i want to be your boyfriend now we've got titles to the relationship we got a boyfriend and we got a girlfriend so we got tiles amen i i want to i am proud to introduce uh what it was at that time my wife now as my girlfriend i was proud of that i was happy to be able to introduce uh my sonia to as my girlfriend that meant a lot to me i was happy to do that i don't know how she felt but i was happy i was proud she was my girlfriend it was a title to it see because there was a relationship change and as the relationship continued to grow and we got closer and closer and we got more like each other and became more i guess you'd say in love as that relationship grew to a state of love i asked her to marry me oh that changed the relationship even more now she's my fiance and as much as i enjoyed calling my girlfriend i really enjoyed calling her my fiance i never got used to that word i guess that's french isn't it anyway it just didn't roll off the tongue but i enjoyed saying it anyway amen she's my fiance the only thing i don't like about fiance is it's a fiance with your boy or girl i was her fiance she was my fiance so there's no designation of masculine or feminine to that phrase but a relationship change which is the point i'm trying to make our relationship unfolded our relationship continued to grow and we put different titles on our relationship we were now not just boyfriend and girlfriend we were fiances we were we were we were engaged we were she had a ring as little as it was she had one that showed that that we were engaged there was a promise there amen there was a promise there now on the day it came a time where we reached the day that she became my bride she was my bride and i was the bridegroom we stood there in a church with a ceremony that was about to take place and some of our closest friends a pastor i didn't even know but anyway uh we were there to to join ourselves together she was my bride i was her bridegroom our relationship had changed even more it had grown to a place from just casual meeting of her saying hey i like your voice to the place of me asking her to marry me and becoming fiancee to now being on our day of marriage on the day of marriage she's my bride amen and i'm her bridegroom and that's what the title is it evolved even more it changed the title changed then we stood there in front of the front of the pastor and the pastor said to you and she said yes he looked at me and he said to you and i said yes and he said i now pronounce you husband and wife our relationship had changed again right she wasn't my bride although we could still interchangeably use bride and wife she was now my wife when i introduced her i didn't introduce her we we went to copper queen uh hotel in bisbee for our wedding night and when we got to the hotel we looked like we were 12. i mean we had every paper in the book to prove that we were who we were that she was legal and that we were of age and area we had our marriage certificate and everything we took everything possible because we looked like we were 12 or 14 years old but we went to the compromise i didn't introduce her to the people at the registration desk as my bride i introduced her as my wife because we had changed the dispensation we had changed our relationships our relationship had gotten to where we were now married amen she was my wife and i was her husband now the relationship grew to a place to where it was more intimate than it had ever been it was to an ultimate place of relationship and intimacy than it could ever be legally legally by by the world standards and by god right amen and my god i promised myself to her she promised herself to me and we became one yes she became flesh in my flesh bone of my bone and the two of us become one flesh now our relationship had reached its pinnacle it had reached an apex amen of of relationship between man and wife well how do you see that relationship as being any different than when you [Music] got your first relationship with jesus christ matisse talked about this man today he probably may have i don't know it just got his first glimpse into recognizing he needed jesus in his life and a lot of people do that my billy graham went around the world how many times getting thousands to an altar to say i accept jesus right but did the relationship end there or did it continue to grow right i mean the lord only knows of course but the relationship had to grow you you you can't be a part of christ but just saying i accept you lord there's more to it there's got to be an acceptance back if i had stood there and said yes i will take her as my wife and she says no i won't take him as my husband we would have stopped right there we would have never been married we'd have never gotten married amen because the commitment's not there the dedication is not there the sincerity the love not there and a lot of people do that they get to that place they might even get to a threshold but then they won't take jesus in all that it comes with knowing him in that relationship they won't take him they take to know him through a bible or through a church through a denomination through a pastor but they won't come to know jesus themselves that's how you see so many loose lives and people living the way they do people going to message churches and just living all kind of way doing whatever they want and how they want to show up and pay the tithes to come to church be a church member church member doesn't make you bride friend church member doesn't make you the wife of jesus christ that's right amen got to be more to it than that there's got to be a relation it's got to be intimacy there's got to be commitment there's got to be coming to a place to where you know that person unlike anybody else in the world i know my wife like any like no other person in the world and nobody knows her like i do and nobody knows me like she does i don't know if that's good or bad but nobody like knows me like she does and that's just and and it's the same relationship as we have with christ we don't have a courtyard relationship we don't even have an an interval relationship we have a holies of holies relationship right amen we're not out in the in the outer court or the inner court look for him when it comes to the tabernacle in the wilderness with the with the children of israel they had to have a relationship of someone that entered into the holies of holies right for that true god relationship together between the the bride and the bridegroom right back then unfortunately there was only one man that could go back there right amen but when the when the veil of the temple was written twain at calvary god opened himself and sent his spirit back on all of us right now we don't have to rule out a priest we don't have to rely on a pastor we don't have to rely on a pope for some uh denomination we ourselves can enter into that holy place yes we ourselves can enter into that godly place in that relationship with jesus christ that we can know him and he will know us yes amen it's not like the rest of the world friend it's not like those that just say oh i'm a christian no it's a relationship it's that godly husband and wife relationship see down through the ages there was that relationship bride and groom bride and groom and we call it bride all the time friend but that relationship has changed dispensations we'll get to that maybe today maybe not but look jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom the brightest part of the groom you believe that therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life for when god separated adam he was both we find out adam was spirit to begin with now we've explained all this just a moment ago but let bear with me a moment as i read this adam's spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created he male and female genesis 2 he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image and god is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he become flesh man animal flesh on earth he is showing portraying here the bride amen amen she he is there portraying that bride yes because that bride was in her yes oh if you listen that invisible union brother branham goes so deep into helping us understand the predestination of god and recognizing just in the physical element of it and we talked about last week back to my dad and grandpa and great-grandpa my great-grandfather didn't know michael was in there but he was there was a day 35 years ago i didn't know he was in there but the relationship batting ground and intimacy a son came forth it was manifested it showed that he was always there even in my great great grandfather he was there didn't know it but he was still there the predestination of god yeah how is that any different than the spirit life friend the spiritual life of god is the same way back in before the foundation of the world the gene of god that was in his mind was what was to be manifested upon this earth which is the bride of jesus christ which you all claim to be a part of including myself yes that gene seed of life that god put in you was to be you before the foundation of the world right yes amen what is that part of god that part of god that god pulled out of himself and placed in you just like he did adam just like he did jesus amen the word she is the word amen portraying hear the bride listen now he never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit out of adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part the woman amen therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ the bride is to christ flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit amen she's one with him yes amen now me and my wife we didn't become one when we were a casual relationship just to know her know her name know my name not even boyfriend girlfriend or fiance it was when we entered into that bond of matrimony that that that place of of of intimacy that you can only have in that relationship with that relationship oh people can can perform the act all the time but that doesn't make an intimate relationship right just having a a a a performing an act doesn't doesn't create an intimate relationship but i'm talking about that intimate relationship word of his word life of his life spirit of the spirit she's him amen she is him that's the way the bride is to christ that's the way we are to him today that's why it takes this word that's why it takes this message that's why it took each ages message to call out a bride to jesus christ yes that's why down all through those church ages every one of those that died in christ shall he bring with him yes and we are a library man will be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air yes praise the lord we're all sane we have to be that's why it's an international bribe it's not an asian bride it's not a russian bride it's not a a an egyptian bride an african bride a europe bride and a united states bride it's an international bride of jesus christ well if it's going to be international it's got to be on the same basis it's got to follow the same pattern or it's not the same not to god she is to him amen that's why the rapture of the royal seed has to come first the rest of the dead live not a thousand years then they were brought up to the white throne judgment see there is no judgment to the royal seed or the predestinated seed of abraham amen list this now christ revealed in his own word different message now now the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into that one person i've had these people that i've dealt with for many years of 1963 and all the things that took place and you know all the things that they talk about christ is here and that's the return of the lord or people that are millennials and there's people out there that believe we're in the millennium now we've gone past all these things we're already in the millennium scene because they failed to see and place the scripture appropriately where it belongs for us for this day brother brown said the next thing that happens so what are we looking for amen are we looking for any all these other things what are we looking for amen because that's valuable yes what we're looking for that's valuable that means something to us because that that shows what our heart is that shows where our mind is where our heart is amen what are you thinking about what are you looking for see he says the next thing is when it's all gathered up into that one person jesus christ bride and body at the physical return of the lord jesus now tell me how 63 fits that anyway i'll move on making his three times when he was brought there or killed crucifies rape crucified and raised up manifesting himself in the form of his body which is the bride the woman he should get it she is part of his body the woman and man is just look look at this now brother brown punches it down just right exactly to the the to that relationship here listen the woman and the man is just so close together till they're almost the same then he pauses dot dot dot he says they are the same yes they ought to be anyhow which means they are going to be or they are now i mean how close are we yes okay i mean that really lays it down for us how close are we how close really are we to a rapture amen people get their eyes on everything else around oh the bride's not ready but how do you know the bride's not ready well these people fussing these people over here doing this and i'm not responsible for those people i don't know those people are bright i believe a lot of the people i that you know that they are and that's great but i i don't know that my focus is only on what the lord's put in my life to where i believe god is calling yes and if god's doing that same thing there's a there's an elected lady that's sitting out there around the world that feels the same way that pole is getting stronger and stronger yes amen the road signs are out there we see the road signs of course those are very evident but greater than that that pole is getting greater and greater see that's that pull god pulling his bride don't you think that enoch had that what that before he left yes don't you think and i felt that pull too as he walked and had a testimony that pleased the lord enoch hadn't felt that pull pulling on him to one day he got so close to god god said you're close to my home yard of yours just come on home yes yep well don't you feel that pull yes hey man friend i gotta tell you i don't i don't feel just completely disconnected from this world and country today i feel such a pull of the lord yes i just don't see how much longer it can be yes amen so what is it what is it then at that point when brother brown says they are the same he said they ought to be anyhow so what does that mean to us she's the word she is a word bride and the two have become one flesh and flesh bone upon that's our relationship with christ praise the lord amen so close it ought to be anyhow see there you are it's exactly the manifested time she is a part of him because she was taken out from him and the bride today is taken out of the body of christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would for this day the bride the queen the king and the queen just exactly the way the word said it would be is exactly the way god is performing it and causing it to be in our lives in the world today that's why you feel the way you do that's why you you see things the way you do and god revealing himself and that pull that's taking place amen because you feel it yes because you know the relationship is there i feel that pull when you have that relationship naturally friend you feel that pull you feel that urge you feel that that feeling that god put in in each one of us ain't meant to be able to feel that relationship amen when i when me and my wife got married i i had a pull to want to become one with her amen it was it was inherent it was something god put in there he missed god put that in every human uh a lot of times in the world it's perverted into a lust but god put that in everyone but it was something special about it was there was no other woman around there there was no other woman that i'd seen or in the world that i wanted to to feel the pull to have that relationship that intimacy well friend if it's that way in the physical what do you think it is with god in the spiritual with his bride with this word bride to have that relationship and what should be the feeling we have about it amen oh my friend shouldn't there be such a pull yes such a because god put that in there yeah just like the physical god put that spiritual in his bride to fill that pool to feel that yearning for that relationship with jesus yeah oh that intimacy with the lord yes there's something different about it something that separates it from every other relationship christ and his bride yes they become one we're together with him as one amen oh praise the lord that's where god took his uh spirit out and put it in the bride the two becoming one yes first corinthians chapter 12. let's read this first corinthians chapter 12 verse 12. um sometimes i get like brother branham said if i just had a little more voice i'd really tell you how it felt but it's so real friend it's so true it's so it and it's now so much of this so many times people try to put off in the future somewhere oh well it's going to be fair i want you to know if we're that close it is now it is here it is now it is not something we're looking for it is something that we have that we're enjoying right now we're enjoying saints we're enjoying an intimacy with the bridegroom like no other age has enjoyed we have the ability and the and the opportunity to have this relationship like no other age has been able to have because the fullness the fullness of the word has come the cover has been torn off the mysteries have been revealed christ has been exposed we can know him in the intimacy of who he is now oh and if that yearning is there physically what can that what should that yearning be for us spiritually amen amen first corinthians chapter 12 verse 12 for as the body is one and had many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also as christ for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the one for the body is not is not one member but many so it's not me myself and i it is a many member body around the world from the first church age making up the body of jesus christ we're all one with him we're one with each other and we're one with him thus the bride body when it is that time when that time come to say i do you did internationally yeah you think about what brother branham talked about if you haven't listened to it just just briefly it's already 12 o'clock just briefly when brother branham talked about american uh excuse me again invisible union the whole point of brother branham talking about invisible union you understand let's look at jesus for a moment maybe i'm getting a little deeper than i want to for today but maybe we can into next week just think about this this way for a moment with that relationship because if if the body's one then the body comes together all at the same time one part of the body isn't saying no and another part of the body saying yes one other part of the one part of the body isn't saying i don't and the other part of the body is saying i do the whole body is one is coming together as one an invisible union you see the you see the parables of jesus you know in the parables of jesus and i like to use saint john 6 a lot but when jesus tried to talk to them he talked to them in parables and then he tried to talk to them directly and they still couldn't understand what he was saying right they still didn't grasp or have a spiritual understanding of what jesus was trying to tell them even when he broke it down and said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me they didn't understand that right without spiritual understanding you won't people read that in the bible and think that this whole religion is a bunch of cannibalism or something vampires they won't understand it without spiritual revelation understanding you'll not get it so jesus spoke to have been parables all the time and they didn't understand they didn't get it how many times did brother brett did god allowed brother ram to do the exact same thing right brother bam didn't come to us and say this is what i'm doing he preached amer he preached the marriage and divorce he preached an invisible union now the title in itself ought to tell you exactly what he's trying to say but then he goes into marriage and divorce and he talks about living husbands living wives and and all about marriage and divorce he explains you know it sounds a lot like marriage and divorce and so on but he said i want to take a greater application and i want to talk about the spiritual application of christ and his bride and then he goes to talk about you have to be dead to your first husband before you could ever be married to jesus christ the word now how profound it is with the understanding of what he's trying to say without a spiritual understanding you're not gonna understand that whole parable message but what he's telling us is that if you were born in sin shaped he could become the world's speaking lives in other words you're a human you had to die to that first husband yes that first husband has to die and rot and be gone before you could ever think about marrying christ the word yes now he draws it down to denominations oh you can't be married to a denomination friend you can't be married to anyone but the word yes denomination i mean denominations in this message we know that a pastor a church kingdom a minister amen whoever it is there's got to be a death of separation from that before you can do what be married to christ the word amen amen this bride is one yes she's come together as one to be in union together with christ the word listen let me read these couple because i got to close here in the rapture message look what brother aaron says about this bride this uh the bride now when a germ comes into the female he said you didn't become look now you didn't become a human germ from your father and then the next thing you become a germ from a dog and the next thing from a cat and the next thing from a chicken because he's talking about the building of that human the cell that come in there that germline seed broke open it produced the light that was in it and then that life produces cell on top of cell on top of cell on top of cell to produce the life that was in the seed that come out into the form of a human being you look at an early ultrasound today and it looks like a little pinto bean or something a lima bean but once the cell on sale on cell continues to create itself it starts getting arms legs and head and it starts looking like a human right now if it was a dog or a cat the cell of that dog or cat would start sell on cell and cell and then it would look like a cat have paws look like a dog claws and teeth and it would start developing itself as that seed was brother graham's saying that seed didn't come forth as a human cell and then the next cell was a dog cell right or the next cell was a cat cell the next cell was a chicken cell or a horse cell no it was all human cell what did that human sell on top of cell on top of cell create a human being amen a viable living breathing human being now what about the spiritual body he said next thing you know he said it's not a dog or just dog cat chicken it was all human germ and the body of jesus christ the bride will be a part of his body which he was the word and the bride will have to be the word word on top of word added to word on top of word right that's the only way it would produce a word bride it's not come forth and a seed as observed from the lord and then all of a sudden comes another seed of a baptism and then there comes a a methodist cell and and then here's a catholic cell and and then all of a sudden you got a you got a message cell and and and then you got you oh friend if that baby was ever born it'd be so deformed look worse the elephant man yeah yes you got it because you got a denominator you got a method of seed a part of them and you got a baptist apartment a catholic and a message you got all these seeds growing on top of each other it's not going to look like the body of christ right right it's got to be word on top of word amen amen not tucson tabernacle not word of god tabernacle not brahms tabernacle word on top of word on top of word on top of word is what creates this body of christ known as the bride amen there's change i i've got to stop here because it's going to take me too long to get the rest of that that relationship i want you to listen that invisible union that relationship changed we were god's bride down through the ages amen all the way up through in the message brother brown and then there was a change the lord allowed brother branham to preach things like marriage of divorce and invisible union and mighty god unveiled and and the the course of seals which opened up the whole bible to us right and all these things that god allowed this prophet this last day to open up to this bride so that they could receive the revelation of that truth when she received the revelation that truth she became some that revel that that that relationship change remember real quick when john the baptist came to forerun the first coming of christ he said behold the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world that was a change of dispensation right that was a change he came out preaching repentance and baptizing people unto repentance but when christ came he said behold the lamb of god that was the purpose i was sitting here for this purpose and there he is everything changed john said i must decrease so that he will increase follow ye him and it all changed amen the whole relationship changed everything about it changed entered into a different relationship which now has changed and evolved up to the time as the bride of christ toward brother branham and god allowing him to preach those things down to that invisible union and choosing of a bride too in california by the way bringing out that bride to understand there's there's got to be a changing of of of relationship between christ and this bride yes to bring her and him together as one because she's going to produce something that she can only produce with a relationship with that intimate relationship with jesus christ she cannot produce it not what god's looking for she can't produce it as a methodist bride she can't produce it as a catholic bride or as a scientific or medical bride right she's got to be the bride of jesus christ that's the only way she can produce what god is looking for today yes only way so that relationship had to change amen an invisible union had to take place because we're going we're not going to a ceremony friend we're not going to a wedding we're going to a wedding supper a marriage supper a reception which is what after the marriage yes amen who is god coming for in this rapture he's coming for a word yes amen a word because she has become him yes amen let's stand if we could amen what as long as i thought amen so thankful god made the way for this to happen we didn't do it we just said yes lord and followed his path yes god just opened it up to us we said yes lord and just followed that just just followed that uh that leading that word amen and then god made it to us what he wanted to be in us amen let's sing this chorus here when i get an anointing friend i can't find a song save my life amen i could probably find most of without and look at for i was on it anyway 299. amen no that's not the one i want forgive me that is not the one i want 239. excuse me 239 there we go he became me that i might become him by his grace amen praise the lord aren't you glad of that thank you oh friend this is not this is not a religion we're not talking about a religion we're not talking about me i'm in the message i'm not we're not talking about uh having some kind of covering or saying i did my repentance today i went to church or what i'm not talking about that this is so far friend if we could just get the glimpse of i believe it's where bro brown said when this bride comes to know who she is a lot of people that they just don't even know who they are that's right they're scared because they don't know who they are yes amen and what's going to happen this next chapter oh god i just don't know but they don't know because they don't know who they are oh bring that revelation to us amen he did it by 239 he became us so we could become him he became him my grace yes he became so that i might become in my grace for he took my place [Music] one more time now yes he became so that i might recall him [Music] by he became me so that i might become in my grace he took my place became me so that i might become him by the race hallelujah thank you jesus thank you aren't you thankful today of what the lord has done for us yes amen i'm so glad no way we could have known it or had any part of it if he didn't first become us yes if he didn't first go to calvary die raise give his life shed his blood there's no way that we can become like him amen amen praise the lord that's why this bride came out of him in calvary praise the lord that shed blood came forth broke that blood cell amen and brought it back to us we could live that life now amen by the blood of jesus christ god bless you amen i pray something will set the blessed strength in some way today god is so good amen praise the lord remember the prayer requests we had remember also the baptism in the morning the lord will just bless it visit us if you can come you're welcome to come uh lord willing we'll be doing the same things again like we normally do so pray that the lord would
